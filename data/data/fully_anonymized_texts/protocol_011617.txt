Section Number Section Title Description of Change Rationale
2.1 Trial Design Remove ddependency of
enrollment of the second 
cohorts of Groups 2 and 3 
on the availability of 
safety/tolerability data from 
Study MK-1986-018.Thiscontingency was 
initially in place to ensure that 
there was an understanding of the potential risks in 
neonates based on dosing in older subjects prior to 
initiating multiple dosing in neonates. From the review 
of all the available safety data from completed and 
ongoing single -and multiple -dose studies in pediatric 
subjects from birth to <18 years of age, tedizolid 
phosphate is generally well tolerated with no new safet y
concerns identified in the pediatric population and no 
age-related trends in tolerability . Therefore , this
contingency is being removed and multiple dosing of 
neonates wi ll be allowed to proceed .

Number of trial subjects Approx imately 42subjects will be enrolled.
Estimated duration of trial The Sponsor estimates that the trial will require approximately 3years from 
the time the documented informed consent is provided for the first subject 
until the last subject’s last study -related phone call or visit .
For purposes of analysis and reporting, the overall study ends when the 
Sponsor receives the last laboratory result or at the time of final contact [CONTACT_26349], whichever comes last .
Duration of Participation Each subject will participate in the trial for approximately 18-20days from 
the time the parent, guardian, or legally acceptable represen tative provide s
the documented informed consent form (ICF) through the final contact (Day 
14). After a screening phase of ≤4days, each subject will receive tedizolid 
phosphate as a single- dose or as multiple doses (twice daily for 3 days) . 
After dosing is complete , each subject will be followed for [ADDRESS_25731] of abbreviations used in this document can be found in Section 12.4.
2.0TRIAL DESIGN
Trial Design
This is a non-randomized, two-part, multisite, open -label trial to assess the safety and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of tedizolid phosphate and its active metab olite tedizolid in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26328] (inpatients) aged <2 years who are receiving prophylaxis or treatment 
for a confirmed or suspected infection with gram -positive bacteria, to be conducted in 
conformance with Good Clinical Practices.
Safety and PK will be assessed following administration of tedizolid phosphate IV (Part A) 
or oral suspension (Part B) to pediatric inpatients aged28days (subjects may be preterm or 
full-term at birth) to <6 months, 6 months to <24months, and 28 days to <24 months 
(Gro up 1 Cohort 1, Group 1 Cohort 2, and Group 4, respectively), full-term neonates aged 
birth to <28days (Groups 2 and 5, respectively), and preterm neonates aged birth to <28days 
(Groups 3 and 6, respectively). A full-term neonate is defined, in this study , as an infant born 
≥37thweek of gestation. A preterm neonate is defined, in this study, as a neonate born after 
completion of 26 week sof gestation and before the beginning of the 37thweek of gestation. 
Study progression to younger subjects will occur as follows: Group 1 Cohort 1 (IV, aged 
28days to <6 months) and Group 1 Cohort 2 (IV, aged 6 months to <24 months) will initiate 
enrollment first, at a dose of 3 mg/kg, based on the interim results of a separate PK and 
tolerability study in children aged 2 to <12 years, MK-1986- 013 (TR701- 120). To ensure 
adequate representation of age and weight within the 28 days to <[ADDRESS_25732]:  MK -1986 15
Protocol/Amendment No.:  014-[ADDRESS_25733] 5subjects areenrolled in Group 1 (Cohorts 1 and 2 
combined), an interim assessment of PK from this study (MK- 1986- 014) will beperformed 
to determine whether the dose required adjustment.
After dose adjustment based on the first interim assessment, Group 1 Cohorts 1 and 2 will 
continue enrolling until complete; then Group 4 (aged28 days to <2 years, receiving oral 
suspension) will enroll .In parallel, the first cohorts of Groups 2 and 3 (single -dose IV, full-
term and preterm neonatal age groups) will begin enrollment at the planned starting dose of 
3.0mg/kg (body weight <10 kg)or 2.5 mg/kg (body weight 10 to <30 kg). After 6subjects 
each are enrolled in the first cohorts of Groups 2 and 3, separate interim assessment swill be 
performed for a potential dose adjustment . Enrollment of the second cohorts of Groups 2 
and3(multiple -dose tedizolid phosphate) will occur only after these separate interim 
assessments .
Note, as of Amendment 05, these assessments have been completed, and enrollment of the 
second cohorts of Groups 2 and 3 (multiple -dose IV, full-term and preterm neonatal groups ) 
will be initiated ,supported by [CONTACT_26350]-1986- 014 and MK -1986 -018.
Along with the second cohorts of Groups 2 and 3, Groups 5 and 6 will open for enrollment.  
Given the high bioavailab ility of tedizolid (approximately 90%) expected based on data from 
adults and older children, the oral suspension treatment will be administered at the dose 
selected based on the interim IV PK data. No interim analyses are planned for Part B (oral 
suspensi on) because of the small size of the oral groups.
Each of the IV groups (Group 1 [Cohorts 1 and 2 combined], Group 2[Cohorts 1 and 2 
combined] , and Group 3 [Cohorts 1 and 2 combined] ) will contain at least [ADDRESS_25734] 
provides more than 3 PK samples ,to ensure total blood collection volume is within a safe 
range for the age group. Similarly, the oral groups (Groups 4, 5, and 6) will each have at least 
4 subj ects, again with interleaved PK sampling. Because of the relatively sparse nature of the 
sampling, subjects may be replaced if they are missing >1PK sample (see Section 5.9) .
Further local restrictions on cohort opening may be applied based on country- specific 
requirements or site constraints .
Specific procedures to be performed during the trial, as well as their prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the Trial Flow Chart -Section 6.0. Details of each 
procedure are provi ded in Section 7 .0–Trial Procedures.

Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background
Tedizolid phosphate (SIVEXTRO® , MK-1986) is a novel oxazolidinone prodrug antibiotic 
that is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_26329]. Tedizolid is a protein synthesis inhibitor that interacts with the 50S subunit of the 
bacterial ribosome. Tedizolid has bacteriostatic activity against gram-positive bacteria 
including common skin pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin -sensitive and –
resistant strains) and Streptococcus pyogenes, less common species causing acute bacterial 
skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), S. anginosus -milleri group and Enterococcus 
faecalis, and other gram -positive aerobes and anaerobes. The tablet is highly (~90%) 
bioavailable after oral dosing in adults, and is provided in both IV and oral formulations.
Following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose to healthy adults, maximal plasma 
concentrations of tedizolid (approximately 2µg/mL) are achieved approximately 3 hours 
after dosing when fasted; Tmax is delayed by [CONTACT_3450] 6hours when tedizoli d 
phosphate is dosed with a meal ; however, the AUC is unaffected by [CONTACT_26351]. Conversion of the prodrug tedizolid phosphate to the active metabolite, 
tedizolid, is extremely rapid, with a half-life of 10minutes. When the drug isdosed IV, 
exposure peaks at the end of the 60-minute infusion period. Systemic prodrug is rarely 
detectable after oral dosing. The terminal half-life of tedizolid elimination is 12hours. 
Exposure is generally dose -proportional in humans.
Tedizolid phosphate is approved for the treatment of ABSSSI in adults in multiple regions, 
including the [LOCATION_002] and European Union (EU) ,but its safety and effectiveness have 
not been established in children and adolescents.
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], Microbiology, Pediatric Ne ed
In both adults and children, ABSSSI accounts for a substantial proportion of emergency 
department visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] [1][2]. However, an assessment of the exact incidence 
and prevalence of ABSSSI is difficult because of their variable presentation and short 
duration [1]. Across all pediatric age groups, ABSSSI can be extremely serious, including 
life-threatening and fatal infections.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) ABSSSIs tend to 
be associated with relatively high morbidity and mortality rates [3] [4] . The causative 
organisms for ABSSSI for both pediatric and adult populations are most commonly gram -
positive bacteria including S. aureus , Group A streptococci, and enterococcus species [1]. 
Community -acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has become [ADDRESS_25735] decade [2][5], particularly in the United 
States (US), but now increasingly in Europe as well.
New therapeutic options with activity against resistant pathogens remain an ongoing need in 
both the adult and pediatric popula tions.
Pediatric Age Subsets
Among pediatric groups, ABSSSIs are seen from premature infants to teenagers, without 
predilection for a particular age subset. The profile of causative ABSSSI pathogens is the 
same across pediatric age subsets without importan t differences from adult infection, with the

Protocol/Amendment No.:  014-[ADDRESS_25736] on the 
reproductive system or peripheral or central nervous systems was noted. Tedizolid- related 
effects (which included decreased red blood cell, hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelets, and 
reticulocytes values) in juvenile rats were reversible and similar to effects observed in adult 
rats, although the effects in juvenile rats were noted at lower exposure levels compared with 
adult rats. These results suggest that juveniles may be more sensitive to tedizolid- related 
effects compared wi th adults.
Adult Clinical Trials
Two registrational Phase 3 studies in adult subjects with ABSSSI found 6days treatment 
with 200mg/day tedizolid phosphate to be noninferior to 10 days of treatment with 600mg 
twice daily linezolid at 48 to 72 hours after the start of dosing, based on no increase in lesion 
area from baseline and no fever (Study TR701 -112) or a 20% decrease in lesion area from 
baseline (TR701- 113). Subjects in TR701 -[ADDRESS_25737] 18 years of age, 
while subjects in TR701 -113 could be as young as 12 years of age, although only 2 
adolescents were enrolled. The change in the age criteria for eligibility from the TR701 -112 
study to the second TR701 -113 study was based on PK and safety data from TR701 -111, a 
Phase 1 PK study in adolescents. One adolescent received tedizolid phosphate in Study 
TR701 -113 and was considered a clinical success and experienced no treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs).  
Pediatric Clinical Trials
Two Phase [ADDRESS_25738] been completed in pediatric patients. In 
aPhase 1 Study TR701 -111, 20 adolescents ( aged 12 to 17years) who were receiving
prophylaxis for or had a confirmed or suspected gram -positive infection for which they were 
receiving concurrent antibiotics, received a single IV or oral dose of tedizolid phosphate. 
Results of the PK analysis showed that the mean Cmaxand AUC ∞for oral suspension or IV 
administration of tedizolid 200mg were similar in adolescent and in healthy adult subjects 
(in adolescents, Cmaxwas 16-55% higher than and AUC was within 10% of adult values), 
thus the adult dose of 200 mg tedizolid phosphate was selected for continued development in 
adolescents. In TR701 -111, TEAEs were mild, no subjects discontinued treatment due to an

Results of Study TR701 -111 established that exposure was similar in adults and adolescents 
and that tedizolid phosphate was well- tolerated with no clinically significant safety findings 
in 20 adolescent subjects. Results from this study enabled the initiat ion of studies in younger 
age groups. 
Another study of safety and PK of single -dose tedizolid phosphate (oral suspension or IV) in 
subjects aged 2 to <12years has since been completed (MK -1986-013 [ TR701 -120]). Safety

multiple -dose (IV only) administration of tedizolid phosphate in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26330] 
<2years receiving prophylaxis for,or being treated for,a confirmed or suspected infection 
with gram -positive bacteria. This study was designed to relyon interim analysis of s afety and 
PK results from the youngest age group (aged 2 to <6 years) in the PK and safety study 
(MK -1986-013 [ TR701-120])to determine the initial dose in younger children prior to

trial regulations and guidelines, the International Council forHarmonisation (ICH; E6) Good

EU, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)/Research Ethics Board 
(REB) and local legal requirements.
Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen /Modification
The proposed initial dose in the Initial Protocol for this study (5mg/kg )was based on 
allometric scaling using existing adolescent and adult PK data, as no data were available at 
the time for children under 12 years of age. The expectation was that the dose would be 
confirmed or updated when such data became available, and prior to enrollment of this study .
After finalization of the Initial Protocol, interim PK data in children aged 2 to <12 years 
became available from asingle -dose PK study (MK- 1986- 013), and this has allowed 
expansion of thepopulation PK model to younger age groups . 
Area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) is the appropriate PK parameter 
predicting efficacy for oxazolidinones. Prior to initiation of Study MK-1986 -014, interim 
analysis from S tudy MK-1986- 013predicted that, in children aged 2to 6 years ,a dose of 
3mg/kg given twice daily would provide an AUC similar to that which has been shown to 
provide efficacy in adults with ABSSSI . Although tedizolid phosphate is delivered as a single 
daily dose to adults, this interim analysis indicated that t he median Cmaxin subjects aged 2 to 
<6 years who received a 1-hour IV infusion of tedizolid phosphate 6 mg/kg in Study 
MK-1986- 013 was approximately 3.75- fold higher than that in adults with ABSSSI who 
received tedizolid 200 mg in model -predicted Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. Thus, the single 
tedizolid phosphate dose in the present study was modified to 3mg/kg (with the intention 
that in multiple -dose studies in children aged <6 years, tedizolid phosphate will be 
administered twice daily) to achieve expected PK parameters, including distribution of 
maximal concentration (Cmax),that aresimilar to thosefor which prior safety data in adults 
and adolescents are available .
Following enrollment of the first [ADDRESS_25741] approximation to adult exposure (as AUC and Cmax) should bebased on body weight 
range, with infants <10 kg receiving 3 mg/kg and children 10 to <30 kg receiving 2.5 mg/kg . 
Additional interim analyses of the neonatal single -dose IV cohorts have supported 
continuation of the study at these dose levels. In a multiple -dose setting, these doses would 
be given twice daily to achieve an AUC similar to that in adults at the approved dose, and 
likewise provide a high probability of target attainment (>99%) at the breakpoint MIC of 
0.5mg/L .
The addition of multiple -dose arms in this study allows for the collection of multiple -dose 
PK and safety data in full-term and preterm neonates, which will be difficult to obtain in 
treatment studies given th e low incidence of ABSSSI in newborns.

Starting Dose for This Trial
It was planned that s ubjects w ould receive a single dose of 3mg/kg of tedizolid phosphate as 
either an IV infusion (Part A) or oral suspension (Part B).This dose was adjusted in 
Amendment 01, prior to the start of the study, from the single -dose of 5mg/kg that was 
planned in the Initial Protocol . This dose adjustment wasbased on interim analyses of PK 
data from Study MK -1986- 013(see Section 4.2.2) . Following the first interim analysis of the 
first [ADDRESS_25742] been further updated at Amendment 02to 3.0mg/kg (body weight <10 kg, which will
span the entire neonatal age group).
Rationale for Dose Interval and Trial Design
This study will evaluate PK and safety following single -and multiple -dose administration of 
tedizolid phosphate in pediatric subjects aged birth to <24months. Results will be used to 
inform doses for safety and efficacy studies in young children (preterm neonates, full-term 
neonates, and infants/toddlers). Age groups will be staggered (managed viainteractive 
response technology [IRT]), with the subjects receiving the IV formulation in the older age 
group starting first, in order to provide the best predictive data for exposure in neonates prior 
to dosing. As noted in Section 4.2.2, the initial dose planned for this study was based on 
modeling and simulation using data from adolescents and from the now-completed PK and 
safety study, MK-1986- 013, in subjects aged 2 to <[ADDRESS_25743] interim analysis of data from the present study, MK-1986- 014 
(see Section 4.2.2) . Further refinement of the dose may occur during the course of this study 
(eg,after the first 6 subjects in the IV arm for each age group) based on interim assessment 
of the accruing PKdata. The dose may also be altered if a safety/ tolerability issue is 
identified during the study that would necessitate dose reduction .

significant hematologic abnormalities, serotonin syndrome, and Clostridium difficile
infection, in addition to drug -induced liver toxicity and overdose (which are events of clinical 
08H778
Product:  MK -1986 24
Protocol/Amendment No.:  014-[ADDRESS_25745] for all MSD-sponsored studies) . Myelosuppression and serotonin syndrome have 
been observed with linezolid, a drug in the same pharmaceutical class (oxazolidinone) as 
tedizolid, and these events are therefore considered potential risks for tedizolid phosphate. To 
date, clinical studies have not shown an increased risk for clinically significant hematologic 
abnormalities at the therapeutic dose and standard duration of treatment (6 days) of tedizolid 
phosphate. Likewise, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition in the central nervous system 
has not been observed in vivo with tedizolid phosphate. MAO inhibition is responsible for 
sporadic cases of serotonin syndrome reported in postmarketing experience with linezolid 
when given in combination with certain serotonergic medications (such as selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] , among others). C.difficile infection can be triggered by [CONTACT_26352], and C.difficile infection is actively monitored in studies of tedizolid 
phosphate.
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
The primary endpoint of the PK analysis is the AUC in each age group. Other standard PK 
parameter values (as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] [CL or CL/F, Vdor Vd/F , Cmax, Tmax, t½, 
and %BA ]) will be calculated, as appropriate ; however, as AUC is the PK parameter 
predicting efficacy for oxazolidinones, this is the most important parameter to inform the 
dose for later studies. Bioavailability of tedizolid following administrat ion of tedizolid 
phosphate oral suspension (Part B) is an exploratory analysis. 
Pharmacodynamic Endpoints
There are no pharmacodynamics endpoints for this trial.
Benefit/Risk
A persistent ,growing and unmet medical need exists for new, effective antibiotic 
medications that provide a significant therapeutic and safety advancement over those 
current ly in use. Community -acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has become 1of the most 
common causes of ABSSSI in both children and adults in the past 15years [2][5], 
particularly in the [LOCATION_002] (US). New antimicrobials with higher potency are needed for 
such serious infections, especially given the rising incidence of highly resistant and virulent 
pathogens such as MRSA and vancomycin- intermediate and -resistant S.aureus . The limited 
or unproven activity, the limited availability of clinical data in pediatric populations, and the 
toxicity profile of currently available antibiotics that are indicated for the treatment of 
ABSSSI contribute to the challenges of treating these infections.   
Tedizolid phosphate was studied in a pair of Phase 3 trials that included 1333 adults with 
ABSSS Iwho received treatment with either tedizolid phosphate or linezolid. Tedizolid 
phosphate was statistically noninferior to linezolid for the primary efficacy analyses of early 
clinical response (>20% reduction in lesion size at 48to 72hours Visit), and positive results 
were shown for secondary analyses at the end of treatment (EOT) Visit, and for Investigator 
assessment of clinical response at 7to14days after the end of therapy. Tedizolid phosphate 
was generally well tolerated; 42.7% of tedizolid phosphate subjects experienc edat least 
1 TEAE (similar to the incidence for the comparator, 43.2%) . Gastrointestinal AEs (nausea, 
diarrhea, and vomiting) and headache were the most commonly reported TEAE; incidence of 
GI AEs was higher in linezolid patients. Less than 1% of subjects in each treatment group

group experienced a nSAE.
Hematological parameter value s were carefully monitored, since myelosuppression has been 
reported for linezolid. Overall, mean values of ANC , hemoglobin values, and platelet counts 
remained generally stable over the course of the studies. In the Phase 3 adult trials, clinically 
significant changes in neutrophil and hemoglo bin were generally similar for both treatment 
arms, but fewer subjects had substantially abnormal platelet values in the tedizolid arm than 
in the linezolid arm. Likewise, the incidence sof ANC, platelet, and hemoglobin values 
below the lower limit of norm al were lower in the tedizolid arm. No suggestion of 
myelosuppression was observed in the Phase 3 study in adolescents with ABSSSI (MK -

As of 21-Apr- 2022, 69 subjects from birth to <[ADDRESS_25749] received a 
single oral or IV dose of tedizolid phosphate. These data include 16 subjects 6 to <12 and 
16subjects 2 to <6

28days to <2 years, 12 full term neonates <28 days of age, and 11 pre-term neonates 
<28days of age in the ongoing study MK-
1986-014. Dosing has been generally well 
tolerated across these age groups, with a low proportion of subjects reporting AEs (15; 
21.7%) across the age groups with no discernable trends with respect to age, dose, or route. 
Four A
Es (5.8%; comprising increased immature granulocytes, anemia, hemoglobin 
decreased, and nausea) were considered drug related. For the related non-serious AEs of 
anemia and hemoglobin decreased, an underlying surgical intervention may have contributed 
or ca used the events. There have been 2 SAEs (2.9%), neither of which have been considered 
drug related ( “therapeutic product effect incomplete ”with respect to the subject’s response to 
their concomitant antibiotic and failure of medical management of underlying appendicitis), 
both of which resolved. Review of safety labs and vital signs has not suggested a safety 
signal or indicated a change to the safety profile observed in adults or adolescents.
As of the most recent interim analysis in MK-1986 -018 (data cutoff 08-Mar-2022, including 
all subjects enrolled through 06-Jan-2022), 55subjects from 28 days to <[ADDRESS_25750] received multiple IV 
and/or oral tedizolid phosphate for 6 to 10 days and completed the follow -up period for 
safety. These data include 40 subjects 6 to <12, 14 subjects 2 to <6, and [ADDRESS_25751] 28 days to 
<2 years of age randomized to tedizolid phosphate. Dosing has been generally well tolerated 
across these age groups, with few subjects reporting AEs (12; 21.8%) across the age groups 
with no trends with respect to age, dose, or route and no SAEs. The most common observed 
AEs were nausea (3, 5.5%), phlebitis (3, 5.5%), and allergic rhinitis (2, 3.6%). Review of 
safety labs and vital signs has not suggested a safety signal or indicated a change to the safety

28days to <[ADDRESS_25755] likewise shown good tolerability of the 
medication, with only 1 having AEs, none of which were serious or consider ed related to 
study medication .Overall, across the pediatric program, there has been no change to the 
safety profile as compared to adults, and no indication of a change in safety profile with age.
These data support the safety of opening of MK -1986 -014 in all age groups.
Unlike linezolid, tedizolid phosphate was not shown to be a monoamine oxidase inhibitor
(MAOI) in vivo, and is therefore unlikely to increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. While 
tedizolid was a weak MAOI in vitro, exposure to tedizolid as a result of tedizolid phosphate 
administration does not produce functionally significant MAO inhibition in the centra l 
nervous system; however ,the potential risk for serotonin syndrome has not been evaluated in 
Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials as subjects taking MAO Iand serotonergic medications were 
excluded (and they are therefore excluded in this study) .
The safety andefficacy data generated so far support a positive risk:benefit balance for the 
use of tedizolid phosphate in the current and future evolving environment of microbial 
resistance in ABSSSI. Tedizolid phosphate addresses the distinct areas of unmet medical 
need and has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment of ABSSSI 
compared to currently marketed products. It is associated with 
high success rates and similar 
or more favorable safety characteristics compared with linezolid for thetreatment of 
ABSSSI. In addition, tedizolid phosphate is convenient to use based on the once daily 
treatment for certain age groups , a short course of therapy, and no dose adjustment between 
oral tablet /suspension and IV administration .
The safety and PK profile of tedizolid phosphate is similar in adults and adolescents , which 
suggests that the agent would be expected to provide similar efficacy in adolescent patients 
as in adult patients.
Microbiologically and pharmacologically, tedizolid phosphate offers many benefits over 
other available antibiotics. In vitro studies suggest that tedizolid phosphate has a low 
propensity for resistance development against key pathogens involved in ABSSSI. Tedizolid 
phosphate has no known antagonism or synergy with other commonly used antibacterial 
agents. Furthermore, tedizolid phosphate is not associated with clinically relevant drug-drug 
interactions with drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 
serotonin -norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] s, and vasoconstrictors, and is not adversely 
affected by [CONTACT_26353] P450 enzyme system. Orally 
administered tedizolid phosphate can result in inhibition of BCRP at the intestinal level, 
increasing plasma concentrations of BCRP substrates such as rosuvastatin , and the potential 
for adverse reactions. If possible, an interruption in the treatment of the coadministered 
BCRP substrate medicinal product should be considered during treatment with oral tedizolid 
phosphate , espe cially for BCRP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, methotrexate, 
topotecan, or irinotecan) .
Thus, since tedizolid phosphate has already proven efficacious in adults for gram -positive 
infections, there is minimal risk with regard to the treatment of the underlying issue for the 
subjects in this study. Notably, subjects are required to be concomitantly receiving antibiotics

Trial Blinding
This is an open -label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator and subject will know the 
treatment ad ministered.
Randomization or Treatment Allocation
During the course of the study, subjects will be assigned non-randomly to one of 2 different 
treatment routes (IV or orally) and to a specific PK sampling scheme. Treatment allocation 
will be controlled, and the PK sampling scheme will be assigned viaIRT.
After thedocumented informed consent form isprovided by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian/LAR and 
study eligibility is confirmed, designated site study staff will obtain the subject’s treatment
allocati onnumber and trial drug assignment from a computer -generated allocation code via 
IRT. Subjects enrolled in the study will be assigned the treatment and PK sampling scheme
corresponding to the next available allocation number in the computer -generated sche dule.
Treatment allocation will occur centrally using IRT. There are 6 treatment Groups (Group 1 
is split into Cohorts 1 and 2 for the purposes of enrollment only) .Within each Group, 
subjects will be assigned to one of two PK sampling schema, as described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 . Subjects will be assigned non-randomly to tedizolid phosphate IV or oral 
suspension as follows:
Group 1 (N=10):
Cohort 1 (n=4-6 ): MK-1986 IVsingle -dose given to pediatric subjects aged28days

Stratification
Treatment allocation will be stratified according to age .
Concomitant Medications /Vaccinations (Allowed & Prohibited)
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may 
be required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor 
Clinical Director. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the 
invest igator and/or the subject's primary physician. However, the decision to continue the 
subject on trial therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the 
investigator, the Sponsor and the subject ’s legally acceptable representative .
Prohibited concomitant medications for all Groups include the following :
Rifampin
BCRP substrates if given orally (topotecan, irinotecan, methotrexate, and 
rosuvastatin) , for children receiving oral study medication
MAOIs or serotonergic agents including tricycl ic antidepressants, selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists 
(triptans), meperidine, or buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331] (see Section 12.3)
In addition, for subjects receiving oral suspension (Part B), proton pump inhibitor s, H2 
blocker s, and antacid use areprohibited.
Note: Breastfed infants should be excluded if the mother is receiving any excluded 
medication , with the except ionsofproton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers, and antacids.

Diet/Activity/Other Considerations
There are no dietary or activity restrictions in this trial, except for oral dosing, timeframe of 
the most recent meal must be recorded (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ).
Subject Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria
Discontinuation of Treatment
Discontinuation of treatment does not represent withdrawal from the trial.
As certain data on clinical events beyond treatment discontinuation may be important to the 
study, they must be collected through the subject’s last scheduled follow -up, even if the 
subject has discontinued treatment .  Therefore, all subjects who discontinue trial treatment
prior to completion of the treatment will still continue to participate in the trial as specified in 
Section 6.0 - Trial Flow Chart and Section [IP_ADDRESS] –Discontinued Subjects Continuing to be 
Monitored in the Trial.
Subjects may discontinue treatment at any time for any reason or be dropped from treatment
at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject 
may be discontinued from treatment by [CONTACT_26354], the trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.  
Specific details regarding procedures to be performed at treatment discontinuation are 
provided in Section 7.1.4 –Other Procedures.
A subject must be discontinued from treatment but continue to be monitored in the trial for 
any of the following reasons:
○The subject or subject’s legally acceptable representative requests to discontinue 
treatment .
oThe subject has a medical condition or personal circumstance which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26334]/or sponsor, placed the subject at unnecessary risk from continued 
administration of study drug
For subjects who are discontinued from treatment but continue to be monitored in the trial, 
see Section 6.0 – Trial Flow Chart, and Section [IP_ADDRESS] –Discontinued Subjects Continuing 
to be Monitored in the Trial for those procedures to be completed at each specified visit.
Discontinuation from treatment is “permanent.” Once a subject is discontinued, he/she shall 
not be allowed to restart treatment .
Withdrawal from t he Trial
Subjects may withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason.  If a subject withdraws from 
the trial, they will no longer receive treatment or be followed at scheduled protocol visits.
A subject must be withdrawn from the trial if:
○The subjec t or subject’s legally acceptable representative withdraws consent from the 
trial.
○The subject is lost to follow -up.

ConfidentialSpecific details regarding procedures to be performed at the time of withdrawal from the trial 
are outlined in Section 7.1.4 – Other Proc edures.
Subject Replacement Strategy
If a subject discontinues from the trial or is missing >1PK sample ,a replacement subject 
may be enrolled if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1034]. The replacement subject will 
generally receive the same treatment and PK sampling sequence (as appropriate) as the 
subject being replaced. The replacement subject will be assigned a unique allocation number
via IR T.
Beginning and End of the Trial
Theoverall trial begins when documented informed consent is provided for the first subject.  
The overall trial ends when the last subject completes the last study- related phone -call or 
visit, discontinues from the trial or is lost to follow -up (i.e. the subject is unable to be 
contact[CONTACT_19379]).
For purposes of analysis and reporting, the overall study ends when the Sponsor receives the 
last laboratory result or at the time o f final contact [CONTACT_26355], whichever comes 
last.
Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination
The clinical study may be terminated early if the extent (incidence and/or severity) of 
emerging effects/clinical endpoints is such that the risk/benefit ratio to the study population 
as a whole is unacceptable. In addition, further recruitment in the study or at (a) particular 
study site(s) may be stopped due to insufficient compliance with the protocol, GCP, and/or 
other applicable regulatory requirements, procedure -related problems or the number of 
discontinuations for administrative reasons is too high.

Trial Procedures
The Trial Flow Chart -Section 6.0summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to 
perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_1275].
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_26357]. In some cases, such evaluation/testing 
may be potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations 
may require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject ’s legally 
acceptable representative .  In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in 
accordance with those regulations.
Administrative Procedure s
Informed Consent
The investigator or qualified designee must obtain documented informed consent from each 
potential subject’s legally acceptable representative prior to participating in a clinical trial . If 
there are changes to the subject’s status during the trial (e.g., health or age of majority 
requirements), the investigator or qualified designee must ensure the appropriate consent is in 
place . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_25767]’s legally acceptable representative must be document ed on a 
consent form . 
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject ’s legally 
acceptable representative before that subject’s participation in the trial.
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised informed conse nt form and any 
written information provided to the subject’s legally acceptable representative must receive 
the IRB/ERC’s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  The subject ’slegally 
acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes 
available that may be relevant to willingness for the subject to continue participation in the 
trial.  The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised 
consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative’s dated signature.
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at 
the protocol level.  
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations 
and Sponsor requirements.

Visit Require ments
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6 .0-Trial Flow Chart.   Specific procedure -related 
details are provided above in Section 7.1 - Trial Procedures.
Screening Visit
Within 4 days (inclusive, Day -3 to Day 1)prior to treatment allocation, potential subjects 
will be evaluated to determine that they fulfill the entry requirements as set forth in Section 
5.1. Age eligibility will be assessed at the Screening Visit. Screening procedures may be 
repeated after consultation with the Sponsor. If a subject is rescreened, screening procedures 
should be repeated, unless they fall within the window specified. A subject may be 
rescreened only 1 time ; age eligibility will be determined at rescreening.
Treatment Period Visit s
Details of allocat ion to treatment (IV or oral) and PK sampling scheme are provided in 
Section 5.3. Details about thePK sampling schemes are provided in Section 7. [IP_ADDRESS].
Details of blood sampling, processing, handling, and processing procedures will be provided 
in the Laboratory Manual .
Discontinued Subjects Continuing to be Monitored in the Trial
Subjects who discontinue treatment (including subjects who discontinue from study drug 
partway through an infusion) should have all safety assessments (including clinical safety 
labs, vital signs, physical exam ination, and collection of adverse events and medical history) 
completed as per Section 6.0, but do not need to have PK sampling performed. This is also 
true of subjects who “spit up” the oral dose. 
Subjects who discontinue from the study prior to receiving a dose of treatment (eg,due to 
removal of consent by [CONTACT_26361], or due to an emergent condition or circumstance 
which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335], places the subject at unnecess ary risk 
through continued participation ,or does not allow adherence to the protocol) do not need to 
conduct further visits or assessments.

specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
frequenc y and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the 
use of the Sponsor’s product, is also an adverse event.
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  
Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_26336] a physiologically appropriate time.
Sponsor's product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, 
diagnostic agent or protocol -specified procedure, whether investigational (including placebo 
or active comparator medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by [CONTACT_26363].
Adverse events may occur during clinical trials, or as prescribed in clinical practice, from 
overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.
All adverse events that occur after the parti cipant’s legally authorized representative provides 
documented informed consent but before treatment allocation/randomization must be 
reported by [CONTACT_26364], or are the 
result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or 
discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure . From the time of 
treatment allocation/ randomization through [ADDRESS_25775] be reported by [CONTACT_093]. Such events will be recorded at each 
examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets.  The reporting timeframe 
for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is described in Section 7.2.2 .1. The 
investiga tor will make every attempt to follow all subjects with non-serious adverse events 
for outcome.
Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC )data 
entry guidelines. Paper reporting procedures can be found in the Investigator Trial File 
Binder (or equivalent).
Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Sponsor
In this trial, an overdose is any dose higher than 1.25 times the protocol -specified dose of 
tedizolid phosphate .This threshold was selected conservatively, as on a dosage expected to 
produce an exposure (AUC) that matches the exposure reached at the no -observable -adverse -
effect level in juvenile rats after 6 weeks of dosing (rats dosed from postnatal Day 7 through 
56).
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of Sponsor's product or 
vaccine, the adverse event(s) is reported as a non-serious adverse event, unless other serious
criteria are met.
If a dose of Sponsor's product or vaccine meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is 
reported as a non-serious adverse event , using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.”

Maximum Mild awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  (for pediatric trials, awareness of symptom, but easily tolerated)
Intensity Moderate discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity (for pediatric trials, definitely acting like something is wrong)
Severe incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity (for pediatric trials, extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities)
Seriousness A serious adverse event (AE) is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of Sponsor's product that:
†Results in death ; or
†Is life threatening; or places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred [Note: This does not include an 
adverse event  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.]; or
†Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or

Relationship to 
Sponsor's 
ProductDid the Sponsor's product cause the adverse event?   The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor's product caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_26368] a qualified physician.  The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet thatsupports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done.  This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame.  The 
criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event 
based upon the available information
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the Sponsor's product and the AE; the greater the cor relation with the components 
and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor's product caused the adverse event:
Exposure Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the Sponsor's product such as:  r eliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_9650], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?
Time Course Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the Sponsor's product? 
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?
Likely Cause Is the AE notreasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental

8.0STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
Statistical Analysis Plan Summary
This section contains a brief summary of the statistical analyses for this trial. Full detail is in 
the statistical analysis p lan (SAP) (Section 8.2).
Statistical Methods
Safety
Summary statistics and plots will be generated for the change from baseline values at the 
interim analysis and the end of study, as deemed clinically appropriate. Depending on the 
safety parame ter, the difference from baseline will either be computed on the original scale 
(raw change from baseline) or on the log-scale and back -transformed for reporting (percent 
change from baseline). Summary statistics for the raw laboratory safety tests, ECGs, and/or 
vital signs may also be computed, as deemed clinically appropriate. 
Pharmacokinetics
IV Administration (Group 1 Cohorts 1 and 2 ,Group 2, and Group 3)
Anon-model based geometric mean of the AUC and Cmaxof tedizolid phosphate and its 
active metabolite, tedizolid ,after administration (5thdose or first dose on Day 3 for multiple -
dose groups) will be calculated for each PK samp ling scheme by [CONTACT_26373] (if dose 
adjusted at interim analysis ) group. A ratio of non- model -based geometric mean between two 
PK sampling schemes will also be calculated by [CONTACT_551]. If the ratio is greater than 2.0 or 
less than 0.5 for an age group, the naïve -pooled approach will be used to summarize the PK. 
In this approach, only one value for each PK parameter will be estimated for each age group, 
as specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 .If the ratio of non-model based geometric mean between 
two PK sampling schemes is within 0.5 and 2.0 for an age group, individual PK parameter 
values will be estimat ed. And an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model including factor for 
Group/Cohort will be used to analyze log transformed PK parameter values of tedizolid 
phosphate and tedizolid . Point estimates and two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
constructed for the geometric mean (GM) in pediatric subjects by [CONTACT_26374]/Cohort of AUC and 
Cmaxof tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid.  
Oral Administration (Groups 4, 5 and 6)
The AUC of tediz olid phosphate and tedizolid, administered as oral suspension will be 
calculated using naïve-pooled approach as specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1. Only one value for

Approaches to Analyses
The following populations are defined for the analysis and reporting of data. All subjects will 
be reported, and their data analyzed, according to the treatment(s) they actually received.
All Subjects as Treated (ASaT) -Allsubjects who received at least one dose of the 
investigational drug. This population will be used for assessments of safety and to lerability.
Per-Protocol (PP) –The set of data generated by [CONTACT_26377], 
according to the underlying scientific model. Compliance covers such considerations as 
exposure to treatment, availability of measurements and absence of important protocol 
deviations. Important protocol deviations will be identified to the extent possible by 
[CONTACT_26378]/comp liance, and its analysis and interpretation.  
Any subjects or data values excluded from analysis will be identified, along with their reason 
for exclusion, in the CSR. At the end of the study, all subjects who are compliant with the 
study procedure as aforementioned and have valid samples collected for at least 2 of the 
assigned 3 time points will be included in the primary analysis dataset. This population will 
be used for the PK analyses.
Statistical Methods
Analysis Overview
All references within this data analysis section to the log transformation or log function 
pertain to the natural log. If log transformation is used, the confidence intervals for the means 
(mean differences) will be constructed on the natural log-scale and will reference the t-
distribution. Exponentiating the least-squares means (mean differences) and lower and upper 
limits of these confidence intervals will yield estimates for the population geometric means

Confidential(population geometric mean ratios) and confidence intervals about the geometric means 
(geometric mean ratios) on the original scale. 
Data will be examined for departures from the assumptions of the statistical model(s) as 
appropriate; eg, heteroscedasticity, non-normality of the error terms. Distribution- free 
methods may be used if a serious departure from the assumptions of the models(s) is 
observed, or suitable data transformations may be applied.
Safety
Summary statistics and plots will be generated for the change from baseline values at the 
interim analysis and the end of study, as deemed clinically appropriate. Depending on the 
safety parameter, the difference from baseline will either be computed on the original scale 
(raw change from baseline) or on the log-scale and back -transformed for reporting (percent 
change from baseline). Summary statistics for the raw laboratory safety tests, ECGs, and/or 
vital signs may also be computed, as deemed clinically appropriate. 
Pharmacokinetics
Concentrations of tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid will be imputed as zero at time zero, 
where no samples were collected. Any missing postdose plasma concentrations will be 
treated as missing. Values below the limit of quantification (BLOQ) will be assigned a value 
of zero. For summary statistics of plasma concentration versus time data, at least half of the 
values at that timepoint must be >[ADDRESS_25785] 2 
quantifiable postdose values are required for calculation of individual pharmacokinetic s.  
AUC will be calculated using linear up/log down trapezoidal rule.  
IV Administration (Group 1 [Cohort 1 and2Combined ],Group 2,and 3)
Anon-model -based GM of the AUC and Cmaxof tedizolid phosphate and its active 
metabolite, tedizolid after administration (5thdose or first dose on Day 3 for multiple -dose 
groups) will be calculated for each PK sampling scheme by [CONTACT_26373] (if dose adjusted at 
interim analysis ) group. A ratio of non-model based GM between two PK sampling schemes 
will also be calculated by [CONTACT_551]. If the ratio is greater than 2.0 or less than 0.5 for an age 
group, the naïve -pooled approach will be used to summarize the PK. In this approach, only 
one value for each PK parameter will be estimated for each age group, as specified in Section
[IP_ADDRESS].1. If the ratio of non-model based GM between two PK sampling schemes is within 
0.5 and 2.0 for an age group, individual PK parameter values will be estimated. An ANOVA 
model including factor for Group/Cohort will be used to analyze log transformed PK 
parameter values of tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid . Point estimates and two-sided 95% 
confidence intervals will be constructed for the GM in pediatric subjects ,by [CONTACT_551] ,for 
AUC and Cmaxof tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid.  
Oral Administration (Groups 4, 5 ,and 6)
The AUC of tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid, administered as oral suspension will be 
calculated using naïve-pooled approach as specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1. Only one value for

0.5 and 2.0, then GMAUC estimate from ANOVA model will be used as the estimated AUC 
from IV administrated subjects. Otherwise, the naïve -pooled AUC estimate from each age 
group will be used. An average bioavailability will also be reported across age group s. 
For IV administrated subjects with available individual PK parameter estimates, individual 
values will be listed for each PK parameter by [CONTACT_551], dose and PK sampling scheme, and 
the following (non-model -based) descriptive statistics will be provide d: N (number of 
subjects with non
-missing data), arithmetic mean, standard deviation, arithmetic percent CV 
(calculated as 100 × standard deviation/arithmetic mean), median, minimum, maximum, GM, 
and geome tric percent CV (calculated as 100 ×sqrt[exp(s2) -1], where s2is the observed 
variance on the natural log- scale). 
The effects of body weight and renal function on the PK parameter values may be 
graphically analyzed if appropriate. These data may be used in a population PK analysis.  
Multiplicity
Since there are no prespecified hypotheses, no adjustments for multiplicity will be made.
Interim Analysis for Potential Dose Adjustment
The initial dose chosen at the time of the Initial Protocol has been modified to 3mg/kg in 
Amendment [ADDRESS_25786] (see Section 4.2) . Interim analyses are 
planned to evaluate the PK (eg,AUC 0-∞) and safety profile and make dose adjustment, if 
deemed appropriate. Interim analyses will be conducted after PK data are available as 
follows:
1.The first 5 subjects from Group 1 (Cohort 1 and 2combined) , and 
2.The first [ADDRESS_25787] 6 subjects in Group 3. 
Non- model -based summary statistics (including N, arithmetic mean, standard deviation,

Sample Size and Power Calculations
Pharmacokinetics :
It is assumed that the variabilities of AUC and volume of distribution [Vd] of pediatric 
subjects are the same as those of adults as observed in pooled historical adult subjects from 
Studies MK-1986- 008 ( TR701 -107) and MK -1986 -031 ( TR701 -123).
Assuming the between -subject standard deviations of log(AUC) are 0.27 and 0.32 for 
tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid, respectively, with 10completers in Group 1 (Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2 combined), there are 99% and 97% probabilities that the 95% CI of GM is within 
60% and 140% of the GM estimate ; with 6 completers in Group 2 Cohort 1, there are 78% 
and 58% probabilities that the 95% CI of GM is within 60% and 140% of the GM estimate .

principal coordinator (Protocol CI), responsible for coordinating the work of the principal 
investigators at the different trial sites in that Member State, according to national 
regulations.  For a single -center trial, the Protocol CI is the principal investigator.  In 
addition, the Sponsor must designate a principal or coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_26344], to the best of his/her 
knowledge, the report accurately describes the conduct and results of the trial [Clinical Stu dy 
Report (CSR) CI].  The Sponsor may consider one or more factors in the selection of the 
individual to serve as the Protocol CI and or CSR CI (e.g., availability of the CI during the 
anticipated review process, thorough understanding of clinical trial methods, appropriate 
enrollment of subject cohort, timely achievement of trial milestones).  The Protocol CI must 
be a participating trial investigator.
Compliance with Trial Registration and Results Posting Requirements
Under the terms of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) and the 
Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA), the Sponsor of the trial is solely 
responsible for determining whether the trial and its results are subject to the requirements 
for submission to the Clinical Trials Data Bank, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.  MSD , as 
Sponsor of this trial, will review this protocol and submit the information necessary to fulfill 
these requirements.  MSD entries are not limited to FDAMA/FDAAA mandated trials.

Publications
This trial is intended for publication, even if terminated prematurely. Publication may include 
any or all of the following: posting of a synopsis online, abstract and/or presentation at a 
scientific conference, or publication of a full manuscript.  The Sponsor will work with the 
authors to submit a manuscript describing trial results within [ADDRESS_25796]'s last visit for the 
primary outcome, [ADDRESS_25797] 
marketing (dispensed, administered, delivered or promoted), whichever is later.
These timelines may be extended for products that are not yet marketed, if additional time is
needed for analysis, to protect intellectual property, or to comply with confidentiality 
agreements with other parties.  Authors of the primary results manuscript will be provided 
the complete results from the Clinical Study Report, subject to the confide ntiality agreement. 
When a manuscript is submitted to a biomedical journal, the Sponsor's policy is to also 
include the protocol and statistical analysis plan to facilitate the peer and editorial review of 
the manuscript.  If the manuscript is subsequently accepted for publication, the Sponsor will 
allow the journal, if it so desires, to post on its website the key sections of the protocol that 
are relevant to evaluating the trial, specifically those sections describing the trial objectives 
and hypotheses, the subject inclusion and exclusion criteria, the trial design and procedures, 
the efficacy and safety measures, the statistical analysis plan, and any amendments relating to 
those sections.  The Sponsor reserves the right to redact proprietary information .
For multicenter trials, subsequent to the multicenter publication (or after public disclosure of 
the results online at www.clinicaltrials.gov if a multicenter manuscript is not planned), an 
investigator and his/her colleagues may publish their data independently.  In most cases, 
publication of individual trial site data does not add value to complete multicenter results, 
due to statistical concerns.  In rare cases, publication of single trial site data prior to the main 
paper may be of value.  Limita tions of single trial site observations in a multicenter trial 
should always be described in such a manuscript.
Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, 
or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising 
it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be 
published. Authors must meet conditions 1, [ADDRESS_25798]:   MK-1986 66

publication planning may begin before conducting the trial, final decisions on authorship and 
the order of authors’ names will be made based on participation and actual contributions to 
the trial and writing, as discussed above. The first author is responsible for defending the 
integrity of the data, method(s) of data analysis and the scientific content of the m anuscript.
The Sponsor must have the opportunity to review all proposed abstracts, manuscripts or

Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
I.Introduction
A. Purpose
MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting these trials in 
compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participants in clinical trials is the 
overriding concern in the design and conduct of clinical trials. In all cases, MSD clinical trials will be conducted in 
compliance with local and/or national regulations (including all applicable data protection laws and regulations), and 
International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP), and also in accordance with the ethical 
principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki .
B. Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by 
[CONTACT_19481] (parties) employed for their execution (e.g., contract research organizations, 
collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or whic h 
are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator- initiated trials, which are not under the full control 
of MSD .
II.Scientific Is sues
A. Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pi[INVESTIGATOR_19354], clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy 
and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of MSD or comparator products. Alternatively, MSD may 
conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine 
patient preferences, etc.
The design (i.e., participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific 
purpose of the trial and shall respect the data protection rights of all participants, trial site staff and, where 
applicable, third parties. All trial protocols are and will be assessed for the need and capability to enroll 
underrepresented group s. Participants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial.
2.Site Selection
MSD’s clinical trials are conducted globally in many different countries and in diverse populations, including 
people of varying age, race, ethnicity, gender, and accounting for other potential disease related factors. MSD 
selects investigative sites based on medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_18700], access to appropriate participants, adequacy of facilities and 
staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are 
evaluated by [CONTACT_26397] (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD) to assess the ability to successfully conduct 
the trial.
Where appropriate, and in accordance with regulatory authority guidance, MSD will make concerted efforts to 
raise awareness of clinical trial opportunities in various communities. MSD will seek to engage underrepresented 
groups and those disproportionately impacted by [CONTACT_26398]. MSD will support clinical trial 
investigators to enroll underrepresented groups and expand access to those who will ultimately use the products 
under investigation.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus source 
documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per MSD policies and procedures, if potential fraud,
scientific/research misconduct, privacy incidents/breaches or Clinical Trial -related Significant Quality Issues are 
reported, such matters are investigated. When necessary, appropriate corrective and/or preventative actions are 
defined and regulatory auth orities and/or ethics review committees are notified.

Product:   MK-1986 68
Protocol/Amendment No.: 014-05
MK-1986 -014-05Final Protocol 06-Jul-2022
ConfidentialB. Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish the primary and secondary results of its registered trials of 
marketed products in which treatment is assigned, accordin g to the pre-specified plans for data analysis. To the extent 
scientifically appropriate, MSD seeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important to patients, 
physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pi[INVESTIGATOR_26346] -generating rather than 
hypothesis testing; in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered 
and the analyses complicated by [CONTACT_19482].
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the recommendations published by [CONTACT_26399] (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and 
conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named authors 
must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. MSD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications.
III.Participant Protection
A.Regulatory Authority and Ethics Committee Review (Institutional Review Board [IRB]/Independent Ethics 
Committee [IEC])
All protocols and protocol amendments will be submitted by [CONTACT_26400]/authorization 
prior to implementation of the trial or amendment, in co mpliance with local and/or national regulations.
The protocol, protocol amendment(s), informed consent form, investigator’s brochure, and other relevant trial 
documents must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC before being implemented at each site, in compliance with 
local and/or national regulations. Changes to the protocol that are required urgently to eliminate an immediate hazard 
and to protect participant safety may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval. MSD will inform 
regulatory authorities of such new measures to protect participant safety, in compliance with local and/or national 
regulations.
B.Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance. 
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a 
minimum, trial designs will take into account the local standard of care.
All participation in MSD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants ente r the trial only after informed consent is obtained. 
Participants may withdraw from an MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, 
medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
C.Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible, as well as all applicable 
data protection rights. Unless required by [CONTACT_2371], only the investigator, Sponsor (or individuals acting on behalf of 
MSD), ethics committee, and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential medical records that might 
identify the participant by [CONTACT_2300].
D.Genomic Research
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by [CONTACT_26401].
IV.Financial Considerations
A.Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time- and labor-intensive. It is MSD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of MSD trials. MSD does not pay incentives to enroll 
participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may be made to 
compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD does not pay for participa nt referrals. However, MSD may compensate referring physicians for time spent on 
chart review and medical evaluation to identify potentially eligible participants.
B.Clinical Research Funding 
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_19487], and that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may wish 
to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practic es at that institution. As noted 
above, all publications resulting from MSD trials will indicate MSD as a source of funding.

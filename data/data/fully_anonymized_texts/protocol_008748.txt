common intracranial tumor in adults, affecting upwards of 30- 40% of all cancer patients  
[1-3]. There exist multiple treatment options for patients with brain metastases including: 
whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), surgical resection, and stereotactic radiosurgery  
(SRS) [4 -9]. Without treatment the prognosis is often poor, with survival limited to only a  
few months [10].  
 The mainstay of treatment for brain metastases has been WBRT, which has been used for  
decades and is thus well studied. The use of WBRT for patients with brain metastases from  
various primary cancers has been shown to improve both existing neurologic symptoms  
and overall survival compared to corticosteroids and supportive care (median survival = 4-  
5 months) [11]. Unfortunately, the use of WBRT is associated with neurotoxicity and neurocognitive decline, especially in long- term survivors [12].  
 Surgical resection has been typi[INVESTIGATOR_774282],  
limited intracranial disease, isolated symptomatic lesions, and lesions resistant to WBRT  
[13, 14]. For patients with a solitary accessible lesion, surgical resection has been shown  
to be an effective primary treatment approach that is able to relieve mass effect and  
improve survival [14]. However, the limitation of surgical resection alone as a treatment  
modality is associated with high rates of local failure [8]. Interestingly, the benefit of WBRT  
as an adjuvant treatment post -surgical resection has been established. WBRT alone has  
been compared to surgery followed by [CONTACT_774297] (LC) and reduced neurological death with the latter approach [15-  
17].  1.2 Sterotatic radiation surgery (SRS)  
In more recent years, SRS has been shown to be an effective alternative therapy for  
patients with brain metastases. It is especially useful in patients with progression of  
disease following WBRT, for whom treatment -related neurotoxicity is a major concern. SRS  
enables the delivery of a highly focused radiation dose to a small target with rapid fall -off, 
thereby [CONTACT_774298]. This feature should potentially reduce the likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_774283], an issue that  
becomes an increasing concern in long- term survivors. SRS has even emerged as a  
treatment strategy to limit WBRT and has been studied in the setting of brain metastasis.  
SRS has been investigated in postoperative management of solitary brain metastases. At  
least a dozen retrospective reports have been published describing the results of adjuvant  
SRS. The reported 1- year local control rates is variable and has been found to be as low as  
35% and as high as 100% [18, 19]. Review of UPMC’s institutional experience showed 6-  
month and 1- year LC of 76% and 76% respectively, which is consistent with most other  
reports [20].  
Page 7 of 21  
 14-150  
However, delivery of postoperative SRS is particularly challenging due to the nebulous  
appearance of the tumor bed after resection. This difficulty of delineating the margins of  
the resection cavity may be responsible for the rate of local failure (LF) despi[INVESTIGATOR_774284]. A  
commonly employed strategy to improve LC with adjuvant SRS is the addition of a margin  
to account for target uncertainty and microscopic extension of disease. The Stanford University group reported a significant improvement in (LF) rates with the addition of a 2-  
mm margin (1 -year LF: 3% vs. 16%) without an associated increase in toxicity [21]. In  
contrast, a French group has reported an experience of delivering SRS with a 2- mm margin  
and reported no improvement in 1- year LC (69% vs. 72%) and an increased rate of severe  
parenchymal complications [22].  
 In addition to localizing the tumor bed, another potential negative consequence to the  
sequence of postoperative SRS is the time course between resection and radiation treatment. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_774285]. During this interval, the tumor bed is given additional time and may have a  
detrimental impact on LC.  
 For these reasons, once a patient has been deemed a candidate for surgical resection of a  
brain metastasis, it is generally accepted that radiation of some form must be given to  
facilitate local control. For patients with a symptomatic or sizable brain metastasis that requires surgical resection, one option is to perform radiosurgery up front, followed by  
[CONTACT_774299].  
1.3 Pre -operative SR S 
For patients who require surgical removal of a brain metastasis, we hypothesize a more  
sensible strategy to improve LC may be the delivery of pre -operative SRS followed by  
[CONTACT_774300]. Pre -operative target delineation is likely to be more accurate  
and result in fewer marginal misses. Furthermore, this treatment package could be completed more expeditiously by [CONTACT_774301]. In our experience, this interval was approximately 5 weeks. In addition, the same MRI  
scan could be used for SRS and surgical resection; resulting in cost savings for patients  
who otherwise would receive two separate MRI scans for treatment. Finally, pre -operative  
SRS may facilitate better resection margins by [CONTACT_774302]. An early study of pre -operative SRS on brain 
metastases by [CONTACT_774303]., 2010 demonstrated actuarial LC of 97.7%, 84.6%, and  
64.0% at six, twelve, and twenty four months, respectively [23]. More recently according  
to the interim analysis from a phase 1 study of pre -operative SRS for brain metastases by  
[CONTACT_774304], pre -operative SRS appears safe with low rates of wound  
complications or acute grade toxicity along with target volume reduction of 39% [24]. We  
therefore propose a phase II clinical trial to further investigate the efficacy of this novel  
approach

rate of 0.05 for 6, 12, and 24 months. The sample size was estimated using a  non- inferior power 
analysis for inference of a single proportion compared to a known proportion. Also, an attrition rate of 20% was included into the estimated sample size.  Based on previous efforts in recruiting 
patients at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_774287], it is anticipated that at least [ADDRESS_1063416] identified by [CONTACT_774308] ([CONTACT_774312]). These patients will be deemed as candidates for surgical resection of their  brain metastasis, either 
because of regional mass effect (i.e. pressure on other brain  structures) or neurologic 
symptoms/signs related to the tumor (e.g. weakness, visual  disturbance, gait dysfunction, 
seizures, speech disorder). Once a potential subject has  been set up for surgical resection of a 
brain metastasis by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Engh or [CONTACT_774312], t hey will then be referred to radiation oncology 
for discussion of the clinical trial and potential  up front SRS. "Cold- calling" will not be used to 
recruit subjects. "Finder's fees" for referring  a potential subject for participation in a research 
study are prohibited.

After signing consent form, participant will undergo the following screening tests and/or 
procedures (some may not have to be repeated if they were recently performed as part of 
standard of care):  
 
• Complete physical evaluation with a performance status (a measure of how well  
you carry on daily activities), vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate,  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]), height, and weight, and a complete medical history.  
• CT (computed tomography) Scan of the brain (an imaging test that takes many xrays  
from different angles to form images of the brain).

no radiation, but rather a magnetic field to create high detailed images of the  
brain)  
• For women of who are not at least one year post -menopausal or who have not  
undergone a surgical sterilization procedure, a urine pregnancy test will be done. 
If this comes back positive or questionable, a serum pregnancy test will be

The secondary  objectives of this study include: 
1. To evaluate overall survival (OS)  
2. To evaluate distant intracranial failure associated with this therapy.  
3. To evaluate the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) associated with this therapy.  
 This clinical trial is planned as a prospective single -arm phase II study.

 7.3 Data analysis When possible, generalized linear models (subsuming, for example, logistic regression) will be used to combine data from different dose levels. Model assumptions will be checked graphically prior to analysis. If model assumptions are not met the analysis will be primarily  
descriptive. Baseline description statistics on all evaluable patients will be provided for  
demographic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity), Karnofsky performance status, disease stage and status at the time of enrollment and treatment regimens previously used.  7.4.[ADDRESS_1063431].  
 7.4.2Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 1. The patient’s overall survival rates for [ADDRESS_1063432] will meet monthly to evaluate toxicity for this trial. Patients/adverse events will be discussed at these the Radiation

 Reports will be submitted annually at the time of the yearly renewal.  
 All research -related procedures will be conducted by [CONTACT_774311]. The study 
staff will monitor the subjects closely throughout the study for any adverse events, and subjects will be strongly encouraged to report all issues to the study staff. All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the study.  8.2 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_774289]:  1) Documented neurological worsening following SRS. 2) Inability to tolerate SRS prior to surgical resection.  
3) Multiple seizures following SRS.  
4) Progression of tumor or radiation/treatment effect at the target site sufficient to necessitate          repeat surgical resection or repeat SRS.

 The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be  defined as any adverse event that occurs within 60 days 
of treatment initiation of  radiotherapy and meets any of the following criteria:

 There is a theoretical risk that pre- operative SRS could increase the risk of wound healing  
complications, due to exposure of the scalp to radiation before surgical intervention.  
However, the dose of radiation to the scalp in these cases is generally less than 1 Gray, so  
this potential risk is not believed to be a real risk to these patients.  
 8.4 Assessment of adverse events  
Any clinically significant or unexpected disease or condition that is found during the course  
of this study, will be immediately evaluated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_774290]/ study treatment.  
 The subject would likely be referred to the appropriate specialists for standard follow -up 
medical care.

    STUDY SUMMARY  
Title:  REVERSE  Study: A Randomized, Double -Masked, Sham -Controlled, 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_712258] a Single Intravitreal 
Injection of GS010 (rAAV2/2- ND4 ) in Subjects Affected for More Than 
6 Months and To 12 Months by [CONTACT_712280] G11778A Mutation in the Mitochondrial NADH Dehydrogenase 
4 Gene  
Rationale:  Leber Hereditary Optical Neuropathy (LHON) is an inherited 
mitochondrial disease of partial penetrance affecting both genders with predominance in males (~80%). The pathophysiology of LHON mainly affects the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).  The ND4  G11778A mutation 
is responsible for the majority of cases (~70%). Vision loss classically occurs in a  
bilateral sequential fashion, the second eye becoming 
involved after the first one with a median delay of 2 months. GenSight Biologics’ strategy to specifically treat LHON is based on a gene therapy 
approach by [CONTACT_712281]010. The scientific bas is behind this 
Investigational Medicinal Product  consists of 
rescuing mitochondrial 
function by [CONTACT_712282], forming intranuclear epi[INVESTIGATOR_712259]4 
protein synthesis and targeting of the ND4 protein to the mitochondria. This is expected to significantly improve the respi[INVESTIGATOR_705295]. 
Preclinical studies performed in rats strongly suggest that GS010 
displays a potential to restore wild -type ND4  expression.  
Study Treatment:  GS010 is a recombinant adeno- associated viral vector serotype 2 
(rAAV2/2) containing the wild -type ND4  gene (rAAV2/2 -ND4 ). In this 
study, subjects w ill receive a single dose of GS010 via intravitreal (IVT ) 
injection  containing 9E10 vg in 90µL balanced salt  solution (BSS) plus 
0.001% Pluronic F68®. 
Target Population:  The study population will be subject s with LHON due to the G11778A 
ND4  mutation who have been affected  by [CONTACT_712283] 181 to 
≤365 days. 
Number of Subjects:  It is planned that approximately 40 subjects will be screened in order to 
randomize 36 into the study at 7 sites (one each in [LOCATION_009] , [LOCATION_013], 
Italy, and the [LOCATION_008]  and 3 in the [LOCATION_002] ). 
Objectives:  Primary Objective:   
To evaluate the efficacy of GS010 compared with sham at Week  48 in 
the change from baseline of the Log of the Minimal Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) in subjects affected for more than 6 months and to 12 months  
by [CONTACT_712284] .

    Secondary Objectives:   
• To evaluate the efficacy of GS010 compared with sham over the 
follow- up period and at Week 96 in the change from baseline of the 
LogMAR. 
• To verify whether the efficacy at Week 48 and at Week 96 of GS010 
compared with sham and measured by [CONTACT_712285] - or 
worse -seeing -eye. 
• To verify whether the rate of responders at Week [ADDRESS_968836] is dependent th e treatment of the better- or 
worse -seeing  eye at entry.  
• To assess the effect of GS010 on parameters measured with high 
resolution spectral -domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-
OCT).  
• To assess the effect of GS010 on standardized automated visual 
fields  obtained with the Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) Analyzer II.  
• To assess the effect of GS010 on contrast sensitivity measured with the Pelli -Robson chart. 
• To assess the effect of GS010 on color vision measured  with the 
Farnsworth -Munsell [ADDRESS_968837].  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
Study Design:  GS-LHON- CLIN-03B is a Phase III double- masked, sham -controlled, 
multicenter, multi-country study. Recruitment is competitive.  
Both eyes will receive standard antiseptic  preparation, administration 
of topi[INVESTIGATOR_712260]. Administration of an intra -ocular pressure lowering  agent will 
precede treatment. GS010 will be administered once during the study via a single IVT injection.  Sham IVT injection will be performed by 
[CONTACT_712286] a typi[INVESTIGATOR_712261] a syringe without a needle.  
The right eye of each subject will be randomly allocated to receive 
either GS010 or sham treatment in  a 1:1 allocation ratio.  The fellow 
(left)  eye will receive the treatment not allocated to the right  eye. 

Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968838] will be the same in the better and worse seeing -eye. Secondarily, in order to verify this hypothesis , an 
adaptive randomization technique called Efron ’s minimization method 
will be used to minimize the imbalance of trea tment groups between 
the better -seeing  eyes treated and worse-seeing eyes treated . 
Masking  will be accomplished with sham injection of the fellow eye. 
Thus treatment allocation will be double -masked for both the subject  
and the investigation (follow-up) team. The pharmacy team, as well as 
the physician and medical team perform ing the GS010 admi nistration 
and sham injection will be unmasked to treatment allocation. This 
treating, unmasked medical team will also perform the first follow -up 
visit (Visit 4), as well as focused follow up of ocular adverse events 
(AEs) commencing at Visits 3 and 4 unt il resolution of the AE or the 
determination that no further clinical evolution is expected. Centralized 
analysis of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) 
visual acuity results, automated visual fields, SD -OCT, color vision and 
contrast sensitivity will be performed.  
Trial visits:  
The trial is divided into the following visits:  
• Screening Visit (Visit 1): From [ADDRESS_968839] (IMP)  administration.  This visit 
will allow Investigator s to assess subject eligibility  based  on 
selection and non- selection criteria . 
• Inclusion Visit (Visit 2): 1 day before the IMP administration.  Screening

Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968840]’s eligibility  
based on inclusion and exclusion criteria . Subjects will undergo 
baseline ophthalmological testing.  
After the subject is confirmed to be eligible for the study, the right 
eye will be randomized to GS010 or sham treatment based on a pre -
defined central randomization scheme.  
• Treatment Visit (Visit 3): Day of the IMP  administration.  
Subjects will receive GS010 by [CONTACT_712287] . The fellow eye will receive the 
alternative  treatment . 
• Follow- up visits (Visits 4 to 12): Nine follow -up visits after the IVT 
procedure will be conducted at [ADDRESS_968841] 
every 6 months to review the safety data. 
Study duration:  
Initiation of the trial with the first subject’s first visit is planned for late 
Q4 2015. The estimated recruitment period is [ADDRESS_968842] subjec t’s last visit. The last subject’s 
last visit is estimated to occur late Q4 2018. Therefore, the estimated 
study duration is 3 years. 
At the end of this initial study period, a long- term safety and efficacy 
study as detailed in a future separate protocol w ill be initiated for 
further evaluation of the safety and efficacy durability. The long term safety study duration will be conducted according to current regulatory authority recommendation. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  The primary endpoint will be the ETD RS visual acuity (quantitative 
score) at Week 48 after IVT injection. The subjects’ LogMAR scores, which are derived from the number of letters they read on the ETDRS 
chart, will be used for statistical analysis purposes. The change from 
baseline in each e ye will be the primary response of interest . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  • ETDRS visual acuity (quantitative score ) over the follow -up period 
and at Week 96 a fter IVT injection. Change from baseline of the 
LogMAR scores will be used for statistical analysis purposes. 
• Response status to treatment at Week [ADDRESS_968843] 15 letters in the visual acuity score obtained with ETDRS or being greater than 
a Snellen acuity equivalent of 20/200.   
• Measure of parameters of high resolution SD -OCT of the posterior 
pole and optic nerve  at Week 48 and Week 96 .

    • Measure of the  standardized automated visual fields obtained with 
HVF Analyzer II . Mean Deviation ( MD) in decibels of sensitivity  
will be used at Week 48 and Week 96. 
• Measure of contrast sensitivity  with the Pelli -Robson chart  at Week 
48 and Week 96. 
• Measure of color vision  with the Farnsworth- Munsell [ADDRESS_968844] at Week 48 and Week 96 . 
 
  
 
  
 
Safety  
Endpoints : • AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs), including those that are 
treatment- emergent and non- treatment -emergent, throughout the 
study period and at each study visit. Incidence and severity of 
systemic and local (ocular) AEs and SAEs will be determined at 
each clinical site and for the entire study cohort.

    3 STUDY E NDPOINT S  
3.1 Primary  
The primary endpoint will be the ETDRS visual acuity (quantitative score) at Week 48 
after IVT injection . The subjects’ LogMAR scores, which are derived from the number of 
letters they read on the ETDRS chart, will be used for statistical analysis purposes. The change from baseline in each eye will be the primary response of interest . 
3.2 Secondary 
• ETDRS visual acuity (quantitative score) over the follow -up period and at Week 96  
after IVT injection. Change from baseline of the LogMAR scores will be used for statistical analysis purposes.  
• Response status to treatment at Week [ADDRESS_968856] 15 letters in the visual acuity score obtained with ETDRS or being greater than a Snellen acuity equivalent of 20/200.   
• Measure of parameters of high resolution SD -OCT of the posterior pole and optic nerve  
at Week 48 and Week 96. 
• Measure of the standardized automated visual fields obtained with HVF Analyzer II. 
Mean Deviation (MD) in decibels of sensitivity will be used  at Week 48 and Week 96. 
• Measure of contrast sensitivity with the Pelli -Robson chart at Week 48 and Week 96. 
• Measure of color vision with the Farnsworth- Munsell [ADDRESS_968857]  at Week 
48 and Week 96. 
  
  
  
3.4 Sa
fety 
• Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including those that are treatment- emergent and non- treatment- emergent, throughout the study period and at 
each study visit. Incidence and severity of systemic and local (ocular) AEs and SAEs 
will be determined at each clinical site and for the entire study cohort.  
  
 
 
 
   
  

Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968858] will be randomly allocated to receive either GS010 or sham  
treatment in  a 1:1 allocation ratio. The fellow (left) eye will receive the treatment not 
allocated to the right eye. Therefore, each subject will receive GS010 in one eye and sham 
treatment in the fellow eye.   
 
      
 An algorithm with a testing hierarchy will be employed to determine the better- and worse -
seeing eye of each subject prior to randomization. The randomization will be based on the 
right and left eye, because if the right eye is treated the left eye will receive sham and vice 
versa the treatment groups will be automatically balanced. However , the better- or worse -
seeing  eye at ent ry can be a confounding factor , and it cannot be discarded that the 
treatment effect will be the same in the better and worse seeing -eye. Secondarily, in order 
to verify this hypothesis , an adaptive randomization technique called Efron’ s minimization 
method will be used to minimize the imbalance of treatment groups between the better -
seeing  eyes treated and worse-seeing eyes treated . 
Masking will be accomplished with sham injection of the fellow eye. Thus , treatment 
allocation will be double -masked for  both the subject and the investigation (follow -up) 
team . The pharmacy team, as well as the physician and medical team perform ing the 
GS010 administration and sham injection will be unmasked to treatment allocation. This 
treating, unmasked medical team wil l also perform the first follow -up visit  (Visit 4), as 
well as focused follow up of ocular adverse events commencing at Visits 3 and 4 until resolution of the AE or the determination that no further clinical evolution is expected . Right eye - SHAM / Left eye - GS010 Treatment groups:

Enrolled subjects will include those able to read letters on the ETDRS chart (“on -chart” 
subjects) and those unable to read letters on the ETDRS chart but able to count fingers of 
the examiner at a given distance (“off -chart” subjects). On -chart subject s will have visual 
acuity measured with the ETDRS chart and an ETDRS score will be calculated. On -chart 
subject s will also have a Snellen acuity obtainable from the number of lines read on the 
ETDRS chart.  
Off-chart subjects included in the study must maintain the visual ability to allow them to 
count fingers of the examiner as per the selection criteria. Off -chart subjects will not have 
an ETDRS score or a Snellen acuity obtainable from the ETDRS chart. Snellen acuity will be obtained utilizing the measured distance at which the subject was able to count the fingers of the examiner and a standardized formula available at ( Karanjia 2014):  
http://www.countfingers.com/  
The Snellen acuities of on -chart and off -chart subjects will be converted to LogMAR for 
statistical analysis. Snellen acuities will be transformed to LogMAR using the standard formula available at:  
http://www.myvisiontest.com/logmar.php 
Additionally, 1 ETDRS line is considered equivalent to 0.1 LogMAR. The visual testing at Visit 4 will be conducted for safety purposes and will not be analyzed 
as efficacy data (see Section 7.6.3).

visit at which visual acuity testing is conducted. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_968898] will be obtained with the Spectralis® OCT (Heidelberg Engineering). Parameters 
will be obtained for the optic nerve (retinal nerve fiber la yer) and posterior pole  per 
standard protocols included in the Spectralis software. A central reading center will 
perform quality control, analysis and interpretation of all SD -OCT data.

    8 STUDY DRUG MANAGEMEN T 
8.1 Description of GS010 
AAV is a small parvovirus that infects humans and other primate species.  The vector  used 
in this study is a recombinant form of the serotype 2 of the AAV2 vector, rAAV2/2 , 
encoding the human ND4  gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early 
promoter in an intron -containing expression cassette (beta globin intron, HBB2 ), flanked 
by [CONTACT_712302].  The construct includes the cis -acting elements of the 
human COX1 0 mRNA ( mitochondrial targeting sequence  5’ of the complementary  DNA 
[cDNA] , and the 3’untranslated region at the 3’ end of the cDNA) ensuring the efficient 
mRNA targeting to mitochondria and delivery of the corresponding protein.  
8.1.1 Formulation  
GS010 (rAAV2/2 -ND4 ) drug product is a sterile suspension of purified viral vector 
formulated in balanced salt solution (BSS)  plus 0.001% Pluronic F68®. It is filled in vials  
and stored frozen at ≤ -70°C ready for intended medical use . Details on the preparation of 
GS010 IMP for administration to subjects are described in the Pharmacy Manual. 
8.1.2 Storage  
IMP is stored at ≤-70°C in a freezer under the supervision of the study pharmacist or the 
Investigator. The IMP vials will be dispensed only with the written authoriz ation of the 
Investigator or his/her delegate that has been specifically designated to this study. After 
reconstitution (see Section 8.3), the IMP may be stored for up to [ADDRESS_968901] y 
with the labeling requirements .  
Packaging of IMP will be compliant with the International Air Transport Association 
(IATA) regulation for genetically modified organisms.  
GS010 IMP will be  shipped on dry ice (with 1 probe for temperature  monitoring during 
transport).  
8.3 Dose and Administration 
GS010 IMP reconstitution  will be performed at the site pharmacy  according to the 
reconstitution protocol described in the Pharmacy Manual . Reconstitution kits will be 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.0  Confidential  
GS010  Page 57 of 117 
 
 
   
   
    supplied by [CONTACT_1034].  The Pharmacy Guide and the Guide for Intra -Vitreal Injection of 
GS010 (rAAV2/2 -ND4 ) and Sham Procedures will describe all details for preparation and 
proper handling of GS010 IMP . 
GS010 IMP will be administered on Day 0 (Visit 3) via  a single IVT injection in one eye 
of each subject . The dose of GS010 to be administered is 9E10 vg/eye. The injection will 
be performed in the vitreous humor under local anesthesia. The volume of the injected 
formulation is 90 μL.  
Sham IVT injection will be performed on the fellow eye (i.e. the one not randomized to 
receive GS010). Sham procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_712303] a typi[INVESTIGATOR_712271] a syringe without needle. 
IVT injection and sham procedures, including pre - and post -procedure steps, will be 
performed according to the  Guide for Intra -Vitreal Injection of GS010 (rAAV2/2 -ND4 ) 
and Sham Procedures. 
8.4 Dispensing and Accountability  
GS010 IMP will only be dispensed, according to Investigator’s prescription, to eligible 
subject s who meet all selection and inclusion criteria and according to the treatment 
scheme.  
GS010 IMP will be tracked during the handling process from prescription to destruc tion 
(through dispensation, reconstitution, administration and decontamination). 
The Investigator  or, depending on center organization, the Pharmacist or the person 
responsible for study medication management will keep an IMP accountability log 
detailing the dates , batch  number and quantity dispensed for each subject.  
Accountability records will be verified by [CONTACT_712304].  All used and 
unused GS010 IMP vials will be recorded.  
At the end of the study, all unused GS010 IMP vials will be destroyed at the investigation 
center following internal procedures  for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) . A copy 
of the certificate of destruction should be made available to the sponsor. GS010 IMP accountability is ultimately the responsibility of the Investigators.  This 
responsibility however may be delegated to the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128579].  This delegation will 
be documented in the Site Trial Master file . 
8.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Prior therapy is defined as prescription and non- prescription medications and preparations, 
including health and/or dietary supplements taken within 30 days prior to signing the 
informed consent, but discontinued prior to signing informed consent. Concomitant 
therapy is defined as prescription and non- prescription medications and preparations, 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.0  Confidential  
GS010  Page 58 of 117 
 
 
   
   
    health and/or dietary supplements other than GS010 IMP that the subject receives during 
the course of the study (i.e. any time after the signing of informed consent). This includes 
any medication started prior to signing informed consent and continued after signing. 
Idebenone must be completely discontinued for at least [ADDRESS_968902] will be randomly allocated to receive either GS010 or sham 
treatment in  a 1:1 allocation ratio. The fellow (left) eye will receive the treatment not 
allocated to the right eye. Therefore, each subject will receive GS010 in one eye and sham 
treatment in the fellow eye. Prior to randomization , each subject’s better - and worse -seeing 
eye will be determined. Efron’s minimization method will be used in the randomization 
process to balance as much as possible the two treatment groups (GS010 and sham) in the better- seeing  eyes.  
To enroll a subject (Vi sit 1), the I nvestigator will call an interactive response system (IRS) 
and provide brief details about the subject to be enrolled. Each subject will receive a subject number assigned at screening, which will serve as the subject identifier throughout the 
study. The subject number will be required in all communication between the I nvestig ator 
(or designee) and the IRS regarding a particular subject. Subject numbers will be tracked via the I RS. 
To randomize a subject (Visit 2), the masked Investigator  (or designee) will call the IRS 
and provide brief details about the subject to be randomized. Eligible subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio (right/left eye), taking into account the Efron’s minimization 
method, using the IRS. 
The IRS User  Guide will describe the steps of the randomization process from the subject’s 
screening up to before IVT injection. An algorithm with a testing hierarchy will be employed prior to randomiz ation to determine 
the better - and worse- seeing eye of each subject , as follows: 
1. ETDRS visual acuity score for subject s able to read the ETDRS chart.  The eye with the 
higher ETDRS score is the better -seeing eye. For subject s who cannot read the ETDRS 
chart (“off chart” subject s) a standard study procedure will be used to determine vi sual 
acuity based on counting fingers at a given distance. The eye with the best visual acuity 
based on this method is the better -seeing eye. If one eye of a subject  is able to read 
letters on the ETDRS chart and one eye cannot, the eye able to read the ET DRS chart 
is the better -seeing eye.  
2. SD-OCT parameters (to be used if there is no inter -eye difference based on Criterion 
1): 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968903] the greater volume and quadrant 
thickness, unless there is macula edema. A difference of ≥5% is considered 
significant to determine greater volume.  
ii. The second SD -OCT parameter (to be used if there is no inter -eye difference in 
criteria 2i) will be the combined volume of the RGC layer of the  inner and outer  
nasal quadrant s of the macula. The better -seeing eye will be the eye with greater 
volume. A difference of ≥5% is considered significant to determine greater 
volume. 
3. Contrast sensitivity measured with the Pelli -Robson chart (to be used if there is no 
inter- eye difference in criteria 1 or 2). The eye with the best Log CS (contrast 
sensitivity) score is the better- seeing eye.  
8.[ADDRESS_968904] 
will remain  masked at all times during the study. An unmasked team at the site will perform 
all procedures at Visit 3 and Visit 4  and focused follow up of ocular AEs commencing at 
Visits 3 and 4 until resolution of the AE or the determination that no further clinical evolution is expected. The unmasked team includes the injectin g investigator(s), allied 
medical professionals who assist with IVT injection and ophthalmic technicians/optometrists who perform vision testing at Visit 4. The unmasked team will 
enter eye -related AEs identified at Visits [ADDRESS_968905] of the study (e.g. CRA, data mana ger, study man ager etc.) will have access to treatment 
information. 
8.8 Proc edure for Unmasking 
The treated/untreated eye information  (GS010- treated eye versus sham -treated eye) should 
not be unmasked unless knowledge of the subject’s eye treatment is required for the 
subject’s clinical care and safety.  The Investigator/clinical m asked team will be provided 
with instructions to allow them to unmask the treatment via IRS . In the unlikely event that 
knowledge of the eye treatment assignment is necessary in order to care for a  subject , the 
Investigator may decide to unmask the treatment allocation for safety reasons. If the eye 
treatment is unmasked, the Sponsor and the assigned Clinical Research Associate (CRA) 
must be notified within [ADDRESS_968906]’s medical record with the reason for unmasking, the date and time of the 
unmasking, and the names of the personnel involved.

causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavora ble and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  Any event or laboratory abnormality that 
leads to a medical intervention, including withdrawal of IMP or significant additional 
concomitant therapy, will be considered an AE. Worsening of visual acuity determined by 
[CONTACT_712305]. 
AEs should be volunteered by [CONTACT_423], be observed from examination of the subject at 
a clinic visit, or be from observations of clinically significant laboratory values or special 
examination abnormal values.  AEs will not be solicited by [CONTACT_2224] a specific list of 
anticipated events. All AEs are to be assessed and recorded in a timely manner.  Each AE is to be documented 
with reference to severity, date of occurrence, duration, treatment, and outcome.  
Furthermore, each AE is to be cla ssified as being serious or non -serious.  In addition, the 
Investigator must assess whether the AE is drug -related or not.  Changes in severity of AEs 
and resolution dates should be documented as separate events.  
AEs will be captured from the first study -related procedure through to the completion of 
the protocol-defined safety follow-up as defined in Section 9.[ADDRESS_968908]’s medical history.  Intermittent AEs will not be reported as multiple AEs.  The definition of an intermittent AE 
is “a recurring event with the same severi ty, frequency, and causality.” 
Clinically relevant abnormal findings observed during vital signs measurements or 
physical examinations will be reported as AEs.

reported by [CONTACT_46897]), or by [CONTACT_20427] (as reported by [CONTACT_712307]’s medical record).  
AEs requiring therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical care to protect 
the health and well -being of the subject . Any treatment given will be reported on the page 
"Concomitant medication" of the CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity  
The severity  of the clinical AE is graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The CTCAE scale will be provided to the 
Investigators.  
Should an event be missing in one of the scales, the following 3 point scale is used:  
• Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity.  
• Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to affect normal daily activity.  
• Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
The correspondence between the two scales is as follows:

    [IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to IMP and/or Procedures  
The relationship of each AE to IMP  and/or study procedures  will be evaluated as follows:  
• Unrelated:  There is evidence of relationship to a cause other than the IMP/procedure. 
Does not meet criteria listed under unlikely, possible or probable.  
• Unlikely: Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration.  Is most 
likely produced by [CONTACT_423] 's clinical state or by [CONTACT_379296][INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
• Possible: Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration.  Is not likely 
produced by [CONTACT_423] 's clinical state or by [CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_712272].  
• Probable: Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration.  Clear -cut 
temporal association with IMP . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome  
The outcome of each AE will be rated as follows:  
• Recovered.  
• Not recovered. 
• Recovered with sequela e. 
• Fatal.  This outcome is to  be used only for the event leading to death. The outcome of 
all other events at the time of the death must be reported.  The outcome of ongoing ones 
is reported as "not recovered".  
• Unknown.  
• Worsening. This outcome is used when an AE worsens.  The new statu s of the event is

9.2 Ocular Inflammation 
Specific assessment and documentation of ocular inflammation will be required . Ocular 
inflammation is an expected event based on preclinical NHP  studies of GS010 and Phase 
I evaluation of GS010 in GS -LHON- CLIN-01. S pecific, standardized schemes for 
assessing anatomic location, severity and clinical evolution will be employed. Specific scales will be used for anterior uveitis (anterior chamber) and intermediate uveitis (vitreous).

    10 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS 
10.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is any AE that meets an y of the following criteria: 
• Results in Death . 
• Is Life-threatening . 
• Requires Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
• Results in Persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
• Is a Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received IMP . 
Other important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such events are:  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm. 
• Blood dyscrasias. 
• Convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
10.2 Definition of Terms 
Life threatening: An AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a 
more serious form might have caused death. For example, drug induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug induced hepatitis can be fatal. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916]:  AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166504]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13001] e lective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_712273]. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'non- serious' according to the usual criteria.  
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184]  (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether 'hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Disability/incapacitating:  An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in 
a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life functions. 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968918] complete and fax a "Serious 
Adverse Event Form" to the Sponsor or their designee  within 24 HOURS of occurrence or 
knowledge of the event.  
An Investigator’s delegate may complete the SAE  form;  however, the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_712274].  The form can be sent to the Sponsor or their 
designee with the delegate's signatur e if the Principal Investigator/delegate physician’s 
signature [CONTACT_712326] y. The Principal Investigator/delegate 
physician’s signature [CONTACT_605804], as must  his/her evaluation of

immediately.  
The SAE form must be completed in English.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_968919] be reported to the Sponsor or their 
designee as described above.  
If the end of study visit is performed less than 28 days after IVT injection , ALL SAEs 
occurring between the end of study vi sit until 28 days after IVT injection  will be reported  
to the Sponsor or their designee , regardless of their relationship to the IMP.  
10.3.3 Notification to Regulatory Authorities/Gene Therapy 
Bodies/IRBs/ IECs 
The Sponsor or their designee is responsible  for notifying serious and unexpected AEs to 
Health Authorities and to IRBs/ IECs in accordance with local law.  
Gene Therapy Bodies will be informed as locally required.  
10.3.4 Information to Investigator  
When an SAE has been reported to Health Authorities, the Sponsor or their designee will 
inform all other Investigators working in this study as well as those working with GS010 
in other studies  in accordance with local law s and regulations.

    11 QUALITY CONTROL AND AS SURANCE 
11.1 Quality Control  
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of 
qualified Investigator s and appropriate study centers, review of protocol procedures with 
the Investigators and associated  personnel before the study, and periodic monitoring visits 
by [CONTACT_345266]. Written instructions will be provided for study drug 
preparation and dosing,  and collection, preparation, and shipment of blood samples.  
Guidelines for CRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study personnel before the start of the study. The Sponsor (or designee) will review CRFs for accuracy and completeness during on -site monitoring visits and after transmission to the Sponsor (or 
designee). Any discre pancies will be resolved with the Investigator or suitably qualified 
designee, as appropriate.   
11.[ADDRESS_968920] operating procedures ( SOPs ), working practice documents, and applicable 
regulations and guidelines.  
In accordance with the standards defined in Sponsor SOPs and applicable regulatory 
requirements, clinical studies sponsored by [CONTACT_712312] , whic h will be conducted by [CONTACT_2705].  
Site visit audits will be made periodically by [CONTACT_1034]’s (or the CRO’s) qualified 
compliance auditing team, which is an independent function from the study conduct team.  
Audits will include, bu t are not limited to,  review of  drug supply, presence of required 
documents, the informed consent process, and comparison of CRFs with source documents. The Investigator agrees to participate with audits conducted at a reasonable 
time in a reasonable manner.  Full consultation with the Investigator will be made prior to 
and during such an audit, which will be conducted according to the Quality Assurance Unit SOPs.  In addition, this study is subject to audit by [CONTACT_12721].  If such a 
regulatory inspection occurs, the Investigator agrees to allow the regulatory inspector direct access to all relevant study documents.  The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_712313] a reasonable time in a reasonable manner.

    12 S TATISTICS  
12.1 General Considerations  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared after the protocol is approved and before 
database lock occurs.   The SAP will provide further details regarding the endpoints, data 
handling rules, and the statistical methodology to be used to address all study objectives.  The SAP will also include formats for the summary and analysis tables, listings, and graphical displays. 
GS-LHON- CLIN-03B (REVERSE ) will include subjects affected for 181 to ≤[ADDRESS_968921] to receive GS010 or 
sham treatment  in a 1:1 ratio and also uses the E fron’s minimization method to balance as 
best as possible the treatment allocation to better - and worse -seeing  eyes,  as described in 
Section 8.6 for secondary analysis. Data for quantitative variables will be presented by [CONTACT_339708] (for other continuous 
variables), standard deviation (SD) median, first quartile (Q1), third quart ile (Q3), 
minimum and maximum. Data for binary variables (responder analysis) will be presented by [CONTACT_712314]. Least square (LS) means, 95% confidence interval and P-values will be reported derived from models and statistical tests.  
12.[ADDRESS_968922] e Size  
Sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint (LogMAR) and on the paired comparison of treated and sham eye. There is no published data regarding the within subject variance and the sample size calculation through paired comparison will t herefore 
be very speculative for two reasons. The first reason is the within subject correlation between right and left eye and the second reason is the absence of information on the within and between subject variance of the LogMAR. Usually the within subject correlation is positive and the use of a null correlation is conservative. The absence of information on the LogMAR requires a second rough approximation of the mean and variance of LogMAR because the mean of ETDRS (Lam et al. 2014) is highly correlated to the variance of ETDRS (R² = 0.839 for the log- log relationship). This correlation is in favor of the use of 
the LogMAR to stabilize the variance but the transformation from ETDRS mean and variance to LogMAR mean and variance requires additional assum ptions.  Starting with a 
mean 23.[ADDRESS_968923] deviation of 28.3 (Lam et al. 2014) and a difference of 20 letters on average between treated and sham eye, using the relationship between the log mean and the log variance obtained with Lam et al. (2014) results (log variance = 1.743 log mean + 0.48, R² = 0.839) and assuming a perfect lognormal distribution of ETDRS, the difference in means of the lognormal distributions is 0.65 (3.32 - 2.67) and the pooled standard 
deviation of the log distributions is 0.914. Assuming no correlation between both eyes, the within subject standard deviation is (2x0.914²)
0.5 = 1.29. The standardized difference in 
means is therefore 0.65/1.29 = 0.504 rounded to 0.50. The sample size required to get a power of 85% is exactly [ADDRESS_968924] of all subjects, who are randomized and receive 
study treatment (GS010 or sham treatment). This population will be the population for the 
primary efficacy analysis.  
12.3.[ADDRESS_968925] population, which consists of 
all randomized and treated subjects. The change from baseline to Week 48 in the LogMAR 
acuity will be the primary response. The ETDRS score will not be directly used because there is a clear relationship between the mean and variance and according to Taylor's power 
law (log SD² = 1.743 log mean + 0.48, R² = 0.839) the best transformation is the logarithm (slope close to 2 and ease of interpretation of the difference in means of l og). Because 
LogMAR is a  logarithmic scale and is well known by [CONTACT_292541], this scale is 
retained as the primary one. The change from baseline of the treated eye will be compared 
to the change from baseline of the sham eye using a mixed model including the subject, the treatment and the baseline as covariates.  
The center will not be included in the analysis as the number of subjects recruited per site will be very small. The difference in the mean change from baseline to Week 48 between the two treatment groups and associated 95% confidence interval will be reported. Alternative non parametric analysis (signed Wilcoxon test) will be performed as a sensitivity analysis to decrease the influence of possible outliers.  
The treatment effect reflects well the effect on the better - and worse -seeing eye if no 
marked interaction between the eye status (better - versus worse- seeing) and treatment 
exists. To verify this hypothesis, a model including the subject as a random factor, the treatment as a fixed factor as well as the eye status (better - or worse -seeing) and the 
interaction between eye status and treatment will be fitted. If the P -value of the interaction 
test is below 0.15 a potential interaction is detected. In that case the better- seeing eye 
treated wi th GS010 will be compared to the better -seeing eye treated with sham and the 
worse -seeing eye treated with GS010 will be compared the worse -seeing eye treated with 
sham in an ANCOVA model  including the LogMAR at baseline and the treatment. The 
study is then powered (1- β = 0.8) to detect a difference of approximately 30 letters between 
the two treatments.

Like the primary endpoint, a meta -analysis will be performed combining both studies ( GS-
LHON- CLIN -03A (RESCUE) and study GS -LHON- CLIN- 03B (REVERSE). A 
conditional logistic model will be used to assess the effect of b etter- and worse -seeing eye

    statistics will be presented for all continuous variables. The visual testing at Visit 4 will be 
conducted for safety purposes and will not be analyzed as efficacy data (s ee Section 7.6.3).  
All AEs will be coded using the most up- to-date version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regula tory Activities (MedDRA).  Only AEs occurring after administration of IMP will be 
included in the safety analysis.  
The incidence of AEs (number and percent of subjects reporting the AE at least once during 
the study) will be summarized  by [CONTACT_712315], by [CONTACT_3786]’s at tribution of relationship to study drug and by [CONTACT_926]. The details will be 
included in the statistical analysis plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Data 
At each visit where clinical laboratory assessments are conducted, summary statistics for the absolute laboratory value and the changes from baseline will be presented.  Statistical 
testing will be performed at the Visit 1 2/end of study visit.  Shift tables will be presented to 
compare the shifts between the baseline and post -baseline visits. Clinically significant 
abnormal l ab values for different parameters will be summarized .

Concomitant medication verbatim terms on CRFs will be mapped to Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical Level 4 categories and Drug Reference Names using the World 
Health Organization (WHO) dictionary (Version December 1, 2006). Incidence (number 
and percent of subjects reporting the medication at least once during the study) will be summarized for all concomitant medications.  
12.4.6 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics (gender, age, weight, height) will be summarized  
using descriptive statistics.  Qualitative variables (gender) will be summarized using 
frequencies while quantitative variables (age, weight) will be summarized using mean, SD, median, Q1,  Q3, minimum, and maximum. 

Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968928] reached Week 96 but not all of them. The study will be formally unmasked for the efficacy analysis at Week 48 to allow an early registration if results meet the expectations. The study will still continue up to scheduled end (Week 96). Although the study will have been 
unmasked for the study statistician, every effort (see Appendix V  in Section 20.5) will be 
invested to maintain the masking of subjects and personnel in charge of the conduct of the study including study managers, data managers, CRAs, investigators (except international coordinating investigators per Appendix V  in Section 20.5). After the completion of the 
study, only the analyses related to the Week 96 endpoints will be performed (see Appendix 
V in Section 20.5).

imputation method: 
Rule 1: If the LogMAR is available at the previous and the following visits then the imputed 
value at W eek 48 will be a linear interpolation of LogMAR.  
Rule 2: If there is no following visit due to drop out then the relative change (RC
i) from 
visit V i to visit V i+[ADDRESS_968930] available visit (V i) with data (X i) will 
be used as the starting time point. The imputed score at V i+1 for each eye will be equal to 
Xi+1 = X i * RC i. The imputed score at the next missing visit V i+2 will be equal to X i+2 = 
Xi+1*RC i+1, and so on  up to Week [ADDRESS_968931] method of imputation the between eye difference a t Week 48 will be 
proportional to the between eye difference at the time of withdrawal because the same RC i 
coefficients are used for both eyes.  
The second imputation method leading to an additional sensitivity analysis will apply the 
same Rule 1 but Rule 2 will be based on the evolution of the difference between treated 
and sham eye. RC i is then the relative change from visit i to visit i+1 of the difference 
between treated and sham eye in all subjects attending visit i and i + 1. The sensitivity analysis will be a one sample t -test performed on the difference between treated and sham 
eyes at Week 48. This method assumes that the evolution of drop- out is similar in terms of 
between eye differences to that of subjects who were followed -up.  
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968932] available value (either sham or 
treated eye) will be carried forward for the treated eye. This should be the most conservative imputation method.

    13 E THICS AND RESPONSIBI LITIES  
13.1 Good Clinical Practice 
The current study will comply with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements.  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the clinical study is performed in 
accordance with the protocol, current ICH GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory and country- specific requirements.  GCP is an international ethical and scientific quality 
standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides the public 
assurance that the rights, safety, and well -being of study subjects are protected, consistent 
with the principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki and that the clinical study data are credible.  
13.[ADDRESS_968933]/Independent Ethics Committee 
The local IRB/IEC  to whom an Investigator is responsible has primary responsibility over 
any clinical trial performed at that location.  The protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_712316]/IEC. Study enrolment and protocol -related 
procedures, which do not form part of the subject’s normal clinical treatment, will not be performed until the IRB/IEC of record has provided written approval of the protocol or a modification thereof.  The IRB/IEC must be constituted and operate in accordance with the 
principles and requirements of ICH GCP.  
Study drug can only be supplied to the Investigator after documentation of all ethical and 
legal requirements for starting the study have been received by [CONTACT_1034]. This 
documentation must also include an IRB/IEC membe rship list that contains member s’ 
occupations. If the IRB/IEC will not disclose the names of the committee members, the 
IRB/IEC Federal -wide Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list.  
Formal approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC should mention the study title, study code, study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other documents reviewed. It must 
mention the date on which the decision was made and must be officially signed by a committee member.  
13.[ADDRESS_968934] and parent/legal guardian (if applicable) , 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968935] been approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC. For adults who are unable to consent for themselves (e.g., subject has a mental incapacity) consent can be obtained from the subject’s legal representative prior to the recruitment of that subject into the trial. If the 
subject is unable to understand the ICF  or assent form  due to langua ge barrier and the ICF  
and assent form  are not available in the subject’s language, the subject should not be 
enrolled in the study. Subjects  and parents/legal guardians (if applicable)  will be given 
consent documents and pediatric subjects will be given assent documents to review and 
will have the opportunity to ask questions. Subjects and parents/legal guardians (if 
applicable) will be informed of the  subject’s right to withdraw from the study at any time 
without prejudice. The potential subject and parent/legal guardian (if applicable) should be able to answer simple questions about the study after the ICF  and assent form (as 
applicable) have been reviewed and explained.  
After this explanation and before any study- specific procedures have been performed,  the 
subject or parent/legal guardian (if applicable) will voluntarily sign and date the ICF to 
indicate desire  to participate in the study  or their informed consent for the pediatric 
subject’s participation . Subjects under the legal age of consent will vo luntarily sign the 
pediatric assent form to indicate desire to participate in the study. The Investigator will also 
sign and date the ICF and assent form. The time (hour and minute) the consent is signed must also be recorded by [CONTACT_11867]/legal  guardian (on the ICF), the pediatric 
subject (if applicable on the pediatric assent form), and the person obtaining consent (on both forms as applicable). 
If the subject is of the legal age of consent but is unable to read the informed consent 
document, presence of an impartial witness is required to confirm the contents of the 
document were explained to the subject. The impartial witness must sign the ICF. The 
subject must always be asked to sign or mark the form regardless of their vision.  
Prior to participation in the study, the subject (if of the legal age of consent) or parent/legal 
guardian (if the subject is under the legal age of consent) will receive  copi[INVESTIGATOR_712277] (if applicable)  along with an emergency 
card with contact [CONTACT_695228] a medical emergency during the study. 
13.[ADDRESS_968936]’s record collected during 
the study. Study data are not to be gathered directly onto the CRF but must be gathered 
onto primary source documents at the clinical site.  Completio n of source documents will 
precede the completion of the CRF. Source documents may be electronic, hard copy, or a 
combination of both. Source documents are defined as the results of original observations 
and activities of a clinical investigation. Source d ocuments will include, but are not limited 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968937]’s CRF with source data verification for at least all critical data points.  
The source data verification plan for this study will define the level of source data verification required for non- critical data points.  Screen failure CRF and source documents 
require only  source data verification for critical data points such as informed consent, AEs, 
reason for termination, and inclusion/exclusion. Any discrepancies found during the CRF 
review will be clarified by [CONTACT_695232]. This includes C RF 
reviews at the site by [CONTACT_4885], or during quality assurance review of the 
data.   
An explanation must be documented for any missing data. Any changes to information in 
the study progress notes and other source documents will be initia led and dated on the day 
the change is made by a site staff member authorized to make the change.  Changes will be 
made by [CONTACT_2724] a single line through erroneous data (so as not to obliterate the original data), and clearly entering the correct data (e.g. , wrong data  right data).  If the reason for 
the change is not apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written in the source documentation by [CONTACT_15370]. 
The Investigator must sign and date a declaration attesting to his/her responsibility f or the 
quality of all data recorded, and that the data represents a complete and accurate record of each subject’s participation in the study.  
All CRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by [CONTACT_712317]. The Investigator or designated individual must adjust the CRF (if applicable) 
and complete the query. 
13.[ADDRESS_968938] be available for the following to confirm data 
collected in the CRF: subject identification, eligibility, and study identification; explanation of  the study and date of informed consent; dates of visits; results of safety and 
efficacy parameters as required by [CONTACT_760]; record of all AEs; concomitant medications; study drug administered; date of study completion or early discontinuation, and reason for early discontinuation if applicable. 
13.[ADDRESS_968939] documents, completed CRFs, source documents (subject records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory records, drug accountability records, etc.), and other study-related documents will be retained in the permanent archives of the study site.  
The Investigator must therefore notify and obtain approval in writing from the Sponsor prior to destruction of any study records or provide an opportunity for the Sponsor to collect such records. If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement ) all 
study- related records should be transferred, in a written agreement with the Sponsor, to a 
mutually agreed upon designee within a Sponsor- specified timeframe.  
13.8 Data Generation and Analysis  
13.8.1 Data Collection and Data Management  
Study specific data that has been outlined in the protocol will be entered into the clinical 
database by [CONTACT_29569](s) designated by [CONTACT_737]. Data is verified electronically 
using a series of on -line programmed edit checks that have been created by [CONTACT_712318].  Data 
discrepancies will be brought to the attention of the clinical team and investigated by [CONTACT_712319] . CRAs will review and verify all data collected in the CRF against 
source documentation during scheduled monitoring visits. The CRA will work closely with 
the site staff  to address any discrepancies which have been found so that proper resolutions  
can be made and documented in the clinical database.  An audit trail within the sys tem will 
track all changes made to the data.

    14 AUDITING AND MONITORING  
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and Sponsor procedures, the clinical 
monitor(s) will periodically contact [CONTACT_779], including conducting on- site visits at intervals 
agreed upon by [CONTACT_712320].   
The clinical monitor(s) will contact [CONTACT_479473]. In accordance with applicable 
regulations and GCP guidelines, the Investigator shall make available for direct access all study- related records upon request of the Sponsor, the Sponsor’s agents, clinical 
monitor(s), auditors, and/or IRB/IEC.  The Sponsor’s monitors will visit the site during the 
study in addition to maintaining frequent telephone and written communication.  The 
extent, nature, and frequency of on- site visits will be based on such considerations as the 
study objectives and/or endpoints, the purpose of the study, study design complexity, and enrollment rate.   
The Investigator must allow the clinical monitor(s) direct access to all relevant document s 
and to allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the clinical monitor(s) to discuss findings and any relevant issues. 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968941] to subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is notified within [ADDRESS_968942] be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the Investigator must await 
approval before implementing the changes. The Sponsor or their designee  will submit 
protocol amendments to the appropriate regulatory authorities for approva l. 
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the Investigator, and/or the Sponsor, the amendment to 
the protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to 
the subject and/or has an impact on the subject's involvement as a study participant, the 
currently approved written ICF will require similar modification. In such cases, informed 
consent will be renewed for subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation. 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968943] to Sponsor approval and 
restrictions on distribution/disclosure.  
The study data will be owned by [CONTACT_1034]. Publication of any and all data will be at the 
discretion of the Sponsor. The Investigator will not disseminate, present, or publish any of 
the study data without the prior written approval of the Sponsor to do so. 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968944] be conducted by [CONTACT_712321], as appropriate. 
In addition, the Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely 
discontinue this study at any time and for any reason. If such action is taken, the Sponsor 
will discuss this with the Investigator (including the reason[s] for taking such action) at that time.  The Sponsor will also inform the regulatory authorities of the suspension or 
termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action.  If required by [CONTACT_106887], the Investigator must inform the IRB/IEC promptly and provide the reason(s) for the suspension or termination. If the study is prematurely discontinued, all study data 
and study drug remaining on site must be returned to the Sponsor or its designee. 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968945].  However, authorized regulatory officials and 
Sponsor personnel (or their representatives) will be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records.  All subject bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely 
in accordance with this protocol and the informed consent signed by [CONTACT_423], unless otherwise agreed to in writing by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Each subject will be identified by [CONTACT_712322]. Data containing subject 
identification will not be removed from the study center without subject identifiers having been redacted.

    20.2 APPENDIX II – Declaration of Helsinki  
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF  HELSINKI  
 
Ethical Principles  for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
 Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 And amended by [CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_968946], Republic of South Africa, October 1996 And the: 
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October [ADDRESS_968947] the health of the people. The 
physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with 
the words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the subject." 
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on 
experimentation involving human subjects. 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968948]’s information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's 
physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. 
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of 
the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail. The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely- given informed consent, preferably in writing. If 
the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
Study GS -LHON -CLIN -03B Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_968949] obtain that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. 
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy 
or advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents 
obtaining informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The specific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the review committee. The protocol should state that consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized surrogate. 
Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of 
research, the Investigator s are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Neg ative as 
well as positive results should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared 
in the publication. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid 
down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED 
WITH MEDICAL CARE  
The physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that 
the re search is justified by [CONTACT_54233], diagnostic or therapeutic value. 
When medical research is combined with medical care, additional standards apply to protect the subjects who are research subjects.  
The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.

    20.5 APPENDIX V - Masking of the Treated Eye and Performance of the 
Primary Analysis  
The following measures will be applied to keep the integrity of the database: 
• The first masked  review of data will be performed as late as possible, once all SAS 
programs are validated for study  GS-LHON- CLIN -03B. 
• Data wi ll be cleaned and frozen up to and including the Week 48 visit. 
• The cut- off date for the cleaning of subject visits will be recorded.   
• A snapshot of the cleaned data base will be kept for statistical purposes and for possible 
inspection. The date of the snapshot will be recorded.  
• A procedure will be written to trace data modification after the freeze of the database. 
Modifications will be listed in an appendix. 
• The listing per subject of frozen visits (at least up to Week 48) will be provided and the 
status "ongoing" wi ll be provided for unfrozen visits. 
• A table will indicate the number of subjects with frozen data at each visit (for example 36/36 subjects at Week 48, 28/36 subjects at Week 72 and 23/36 subjects at Week 96).  
• The masked team  in charge of the collection a nd verification of data will remain 
masked up until the last visit (Week 96) of the last subject.  
• For International coordinating investigators who review the Week [ADDRESS_968951] results.  
• Statistical results will be disclosed as late as possible. Date of disclosure will be recorded and a second snapshot of the data base will be done at that time.  
• Review of listings of individual data will be restricted to very few people (e. g. for 
pharmacovigilance for safety data). 
• The final masked review (Week 96) will exclude people who had access to unmasked 
individual subject data.  
• No amendment of the SAP will be possible after the break of the randomization code. 
Any addition will be considered a posteriori /ad-hoc  analyses.

 
 A Prospective Randomized Control Trial Comparing Preoperative Bilateral 
Superficial Cervical Plexus Block and Local Wound Infiltration Under General 
Anesthesia In Parathyroidectomy and Total and Partial Thyroidectomy  Principal Investigtors: Raymon H. Grogan M.D., Peter Angelos M.D., Ph.D., Edwin L. 
Kaplan M.D.   A. Study Abstract: Background: Administration of local anesthetic for cervical incisions has proven 
benefits in reduction of post -operative pain
iii, nausea, and vomitingiiiiv in 
prospective randomized controlled trials .  Methods of applying anesthetic to 
cervical incisions include bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB) and local wound infiltration (LWI).  BSCPB involves the surgeon injecting 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine solution just lateral to  the SCM at the level of the planned 
incision prior to the operation.  [ADDRESS_783855] the planned incision.  This is then repeated on the contralateral side fo r a total 
injection of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.  LWI involves injecting 20 mL of 0.25% marcaine solution intradermaly along the planned incision immediately prior to incision.  To date, there is no evidence suggesting one methodology’s superiority over the other.   Methods: A prospective randomized control trial will be performed at our 
institution evaluating patients receiving either BSCPB or LWI with either anesthetic or placebo.  The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate intra operative pain medication utilization, post -operative pain as well as pain 
medication use at various intervals during recovery.  Secondary aims include post-operative nausea and vomiting, perioperative sequela of BSCPB and LWI, return to work, total pain medication utilizati on, site of pain, and return to driving 
will be evaluated at the first post -operative visit. 
  1. Primary Hypothesis We hypothesize there is equivalent pain control between the two methods of local anesthetic administration when used in conjunction with a general 
anesthetic. 
  2. Purpose of Proposed Protocol The primary goal of the proposed study is to compare outcomes in prospective controlled fashion between BSCPB and LWI.  The collected data will include post -operative pain scores, nausea scores, number of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_322237], unanticipated overnight observation, unanticipated admission, total pain medication utilization, time to return to work, and time to return to driving. 
 
 
 B. Prior Literature and Studies  
Numerous studies have examined various methods o f local pain management in 
neck surgery.  To date the data comparing BSCPBi ii iii iv ix, LWIvviviiviii, and placebo 
remain equivocal.  A recent meta-analysis of eight RCTs examining BSCPB 
versus various controls found a small but variable benefit to BSCPB the a uthors 
felt was not clinically significantix.  With such heterogeneity present in the data, 
however, continued studies adding to the power of available data and examining further variable such as post -operative nausea vomiting should be performed.  
Only a single study exists studying the effect of local analgesia and intraoperative pain medication utilization in thyroidectomy
x.  To our knowledge there are no 
RCTs comparing the efficacy of BSCPB to that of LWI. 
  C. Study Objectives 
 
 1. Primary Aim 
Compare intraoperative pain medication utilization between the four arms.  
 
2.  Secondary Aim Compare serial post-operative pain scores during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594181], post -
operative analgesic use, nausea scores, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_322237], 
unanticipated overnight obser vation, unanticipated admission, total pain 
medication utilization, time to return to work, and time to return to driving in a prospective fashion.  
  3. Rationale for Selection of Outcome Measures  
To date various studies have demonstrated variable results with local pain 
control therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594182] a general anesthetic.  If a benefit is demonstrated with either BSCPB or LWI it would suggest further study is warranted to determine an optimal pain control regimen for partial and total thyroidectomy procedures 
 D. Investigational Intervention Patients evaluated in the outpatient offices and who are scheduled and consented for a parathyroidectomy or partial or total thyroidectomy will be approached for the study.  After consenting to participate the pa tient will undergo 
his/her scheduled procedure.  A research coordinator will be in charge of collecting demographic, clinical, and operative data.  Patients will have a form (see Appendix A) attached to their chart that will be completed by [CONTACT_594188]/floor nursing postoperatively.  In addition, a questionnaire will be provided to the patient at their first follow up visit and be collected by [CONTACT_594189].  
 E. Study Design 
 
  1.  Overview 
This is a prospective randomized control trial examining post -operative 
pain, nausea, vomiting, return to activities of daily living.  The patients will be enrolled randomly into one of the  four arms of the study as follows:  BSCPB with anesthetic (0.25% marcaine ), BSCPB with placebo (saline), 
LWI with anesthetic (025% marcaine), and LWI with placebo.  BSCPB and LWI will be performed as described above.  The surgeon will be provided 2 syringes of 10 mLs of either 0.9% normal saline or 0.25% Marcaine solution in the operating room labeled with only the patient’s name [CONTACT_594190] [CONTACT_23164].  The anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist providing anesthesia with standardized fentanyl and versed preoperative ly (see 
appendix A), Fentanyl used at their discretion intraoperatively in conjunction with standardized inhalational anesthetic (Desflurane or Sevoflurane), and record the patient‘s medication requirements.  Patients 
will follow up as previously scheduled  1-[ADDRESS_783856] Selection and Withdrawal

produce local analgesia.  Use of intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_27968], acetaminophen, ketorolac, or other non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), will be permitted in accordance with the study site’s standard of care.  Avoid 
additional use of local anesthetics within 96 hours following the administration EXPAREL .    
 
There is no required length of stay in the hosp ital; subjects may be discharged based on the medical judgment of 
the treating physician.  For subjects discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_790256]-specified assessments till 
[ADDRESS_1088912]’s home to perform the required 
postsurgical assessments and collect PK samples till 96 hours.  
A follow-up phone call will be scheduled for all subjects on Day 7.  For the assessment of adverse events (AEs), a 
final follow-up visit will be made on Day [ADDRESS_1088913] received the study drug.   
Postsurgical Pain Management 
Use of postsurgical pain medication in cases of insufficient analgesia will be permitted according to the 
institution’s standard of care.  Th e investigator must record all postsurgical pain management medications 
provided to the subjects till the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Avoid additional use of local anesthetics within [ADDRESS_1088914] (NRS-R; Appendix 1) for subjects aged 12 to less than 17  years and the Color Analog Scale (CAS; 
Appendix 2) for subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years; neurological assessment ( Appendix 3 ); clinical laboratory 
tests (Appendix 4 ); and vital signs.   
 
AEs will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed/assent is given till Day 30.   
 
In case a cardiac or neurological AE of special interest (AESI) or serious AE (SAE) occurs during the study, if the 
investigator or medical monitor consid ers that the event may be related to study  treatment or suggests the possible 
occurrence of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST; with or without the need for tr eatment [e.g., intralipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]]), 
or if a plausible etiology for the event cannot be found, an unscheduled PK blood sample must be collected and a 
12-lead ECG, vital signs, and clinical lab oratory tests (hematology and complete metabolic profile [CMP]) 
according to the study site’s standard of care may be conducted.  See Section 13.1.[ADDRESS_1088915] pain, abnorm al/irregular heart rate, and shortne ss of breath requiring intervention.  
Neurologic AESIs include seizure, altere d mental status/altered sensorium, rigi dity, dysarthria, tremors, tinnitus, 
visual disturbance, and severe or worsening dizziness (s ee below).  Additionally, the following events may be of 
special interest if they persist or oc cur beyond [ADDRESS_1088916] dose: dizziness, hyperesthesia, muscular twitching, 
and tingling/paresthesia.  Dizziness will be assessed as mild, moderate, or severe based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0.  Mild dizziness is defined as mild unsteadiness or 
sensation of movement; moderate dizziness is defined as moderate unsteadiness or sensation of movement limiting 
instrumental activities of daily liv ing (ADL); and severe dizziness is defi ned as severe unsteadiness or sensation of 
movement that limits self-care ADLs.  Dizziness will be captu red as an AESI if it is severe or worsens or persists

 Cardiac or neurological AEs that do not meet one of these three criteria for AESI should be reported as described 
in Section 14.1 (Adverse Events) and captured in the database as an AE. 
 
Pharmacokinetic Assessment (Part 1 only)  
A population PK sampling scheme will be used to limit the number of blood draws for each individual subject.  On 
Day 1, eligible subjects will be assigned to one of the two PK sampling groups shown below based on surgery type 
(see the table below for PK sample collection schedule).  A total of [ADDRESS_1088920] clustering of PK 
samples.

These sampling time points will not only characterize overall PK of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_790257], but will also 
characterize the PK of immediate release bupi[INVESTIGATOR_790258].  
 Note that a new needle stick may not be necessary for each blood draw.  The subject may be fitted with a 
peripheral venous line at the discretion of the investig ator to facilitate the collection of blood for PK assessment. 
 In the situation where PK blood draws and other assessments  coincide with or occur at about the same time, the 
blood draw for PK analysis must be conducted first, and the pain intensity assessment conducted second, as 
applicable, followed by [CONTACT_702703]. 
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be set up to m onitor the safety and dosing data on an ongoing basis 
for all treatment groups.   
 
Number of Subjects (Planned): 
Approximately 90 subjects are planned for this study: 45 in Part 1 and 45 in Part 2.  Overall, 60 subjects will 
receive EXPAREL and 30 subjects will receive immediate release bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].

7. INTRODUCTION
With the identification of acute pain by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) as a problem of 
global proportions ( Gureje 1998 ) and the publication of the Joint Commission on Accreditation 
of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) pain standards, there is increasing acceptance of pain as the fifth vital sign, on par with blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (Lynch 2001). 
Postsurgical pain is one of the most common forms of acute pain ( Schug 1993; Carr 1999).  
In contrast to chronic pain, for which no adaptive value has been demonstrated, acute pain is the 
normal physiological response to tissue insult or injury and has adaptive value by [CONTACT_6076] a 
warning of danger or damage.  Most acute pain is either treatable or avoidable, especially when it 
occurs in a clinical setting.  However, if acute pain is poorly or inappropriately treated, it may 
progress to chronic pain ( Perkins 2000; Petersen-Felix 2002 ).  Thus, effectively modulating the 
response to acute pain may be considered a primary step in the prevention of chronic pain (Stephen 2003 ).  The suboptimal management of acute pain has been recognized as a problem by 
[CONTACT_790314] 50 years ( Papper 1952; Marks 1973) and has been formally identified as 
a public health concern by [CONTACT_765168].   
In 1992, the US Agency for Health Care Policy and Research developed guidelines for the 
management of postoperative pain in the hopes of increasing awareness of the consequences of 
poor pain control in the postoperative setting and promoting better pain management techniques 
(Stephen 2003 ).  These consequences, which include delayed healing, longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and 
the development of chronic pain, are significant not only from the patient’s perspective (decrease in functionality and quality of life) but also from the health economic perspective (increase in 
healthcare resource utilization and costs). 
Each year, more than 5 million children undergo surgery in the US, and it is estimated that up to 
75% of these patients experience significant postoperative pain and receive postoperative 
analgesia ( Owen 1990).  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_790265] ( Kessler 2013 ).  One consequence is a growing epi[INVESTIGATOR_790266], 
misuse, and diversion ( Morris 2015; Joranson 2006 ).  Specific to the pediatric population, 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_790267] 12
th grade is a predictor of future opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724], with a 33% 
increase in future risk of misuse after high school ( Miech 2015).  
A multimodal approach to postoperative analgesia, using a combination of agents (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
local anesthetics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), and delivery techniques 
(patient-controlled analgesia [PCA], epi[INVESTIGATOR_765131]) is currently recognized as

CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1088951] practice for pain management ( Breivik 1995a; Breivik 1995b; American Society of 
Anesthesiologists [ASA] Task Force 1995; Dahl 2000).  EXPAREL® was developed to extend 
pain relief with a single-dose administration without the use of indwelling catheters and to 
decrease the requirement for supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007].   
A New Drug Application (NDA) for EXPAREL was submitted as a 505(b)(2) application and 
subsequently approved by [CONTACT_765169] 28, 2011 (NDA 022-496).  As part of the 
approval for EXPAREL, Pacira is required to conduct pediatric studies as a Post Marketing 
Requirement (PMR). 
7.1. Indication
EXPAREL was initially approved by [CONTACT_40563] 2011 for single-dose administration into the 
surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia.  The indication was amended and approved by [CONTACT_40565] 2018 to read: “EXPAREL is indicated for single-dose infiltration in adults to 
produce postsurgical local analgesia and as an interscalene brachial plexus block to produce 
postsurgical regional analgesia.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in other nerve 
blocks.”   
EXPAREL was developed to provide a prolonged period of decreased pain and decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_790268] a single-dose administration without the use of indwelling catheters.  
Effective postsurgical pain control is a critical element in patient recovery following surgery, 
as the majority of patients may experience significant pain, particularly in the first few days.  
Improved postsurgical pain management contributes to better healing, faster patient mobilization, 
shortened hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], and reduced healthcare costs (ASA Task Force 1995). 
7.2. Current Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/Treatments 
Current modalities of postsurgical analgesic treatment include infiltration and nerve block with 
local anesthetic agents, usually combined with the systemic administration of analgesics 
(multimodal therapy).  Multimodal therapy usually includes opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], NSAIDs, and/or 
acetaminophen provided through a variety of routes including intravenous, transdermal patch, 
and oral administration.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_790269]; however, they also have considerable drawbacks, including time and resources 
required for monitoring opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related side effects.  A reduction in the use of postoperative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_426652]-induced adverse effects, 
such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], nausea, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, pruritus, and urinary retention.   
With over 70 million surgeries performed annually in the US, postoperative pain is a ubiquitous 
condition among the US population.  While it is a predictable component of the postoperative 
process, such pain is often poorly managed, resulting in clinical and physiological changes that 
increase morbidity and mortality (inability to ambulate early, etc.), diminish quality of life, 
and extend length of stay, thereby [CONTACT_40561][INVESTIGATOR_40496] ( Oderda 2007) and reducing

other hand, may improve clinical outcomes, avoid complications (like delay in regaining bowel 
function or an inability to tolerate liquid a nd solid oral intake), and conserve healthcare 
resources.  As such, the JCAHO requires that all healthcare facilities practice adequate pain management and monitor opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related adverse events (AEs) ( Apfelbaum 2003).
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_790270], and are currently considered the mainstay 
of treatment.  However, AEs related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499] (e.g., nausea, vomiting, ileus, 
confusion) represent one important reason to develop opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing strategies.  Indeed, fear of 
gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, as well as respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], 
present major limitations for the widespread use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] ( Chernin 2001 and 
Viscusi 2009 ).
  Furthermore, management of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related events often requires medical 
attention (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_40500], antiemetic agents) and increased pharmacy/nursing time, 
which may raise healthcare expenses ( Carroll 1994 ).

subsequent diffusion of the drug over an extended period of time.  EXPAREL has been noted in 
infiltration studies to have a bimodal curve ( Apseloff 2013 ), with an initial peak occurring at 
approximately 0 to 2 hours and a second peak at approximately 24 to 48 hours ( Hu 2013).  
7.4. Summary of Human Clinical Experience with EXPAREL 
The EXPAREL clinical development program assessed the efficacy and safety across a wide range of body regions and applications, investigating its use in the management of acute pain 
when administered as a peripheral nerve block for regional analgesia, and as a field block for local analgesia.  Pacira has conducted 31 clinical studies (13 Phase 1, 7 Phase 2, and 11 Phase 3).  
Across the 31 completed studies in the clinical program, safety data were collected on 
3644 subjects (2141 subjects received EXPAREL, 850 subjects received IR bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425168], 
and 653 subjects received placebo). 
Across these studies, a total of 2141 adult human subjects received EXPAREL at doses ranging 
from 9 to 665 mg and by [CONTACT_40564], including field block, peripheral nerve block, 
subcutaneous, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_790272].  EXPAREL was well tolerated and had a

CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1088953] been conducted; EXPAREL did not cause 
significant QTc prolongation even at the highest dose evaluated.   
Across all studies, the types and the incidence rates of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were 
similar between the EXPAREL All Doses group (all doses combined) and the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_765133].  The incidence rate for each of the three most common TEAEs (nausea, constipation, and 
vomiting) was lower in the EXPAREL All Doses group than in the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124183].   
In terms of efficacy, three positive Phase 3 studies (402-C-316, 402-C-317, 402-C-331) 
demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pain intensity scores compared to placebo 
or bupi[INVESTIGATOR_790273] a field block (infiltration).  
All three studies also showed a statistically significant reduction compared to placebo or 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_790274]; Studies 316, [ADDRESS_1088954] 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_790275]. 
EXPAREL was demonstrated to produce statis tically significant and clinically meaningful 
analgesia in adult patients in two pi[INVESTIGATOR_41958]-controlled Phase 3 studies (317 and 316) 
involving both orthopedic and soft tissue procedures over 36 and 72 hours, respectively.  The 
primary endpoints (area under the curve [AUC] of the numeric rating scale at rest [NRS-R] pain 
intensity scores till 72 hours [316] and till 24 hours [317]) were met.  Key secondary endpoints 
(percentage of subjects who received no supplementary opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]; total amount of postoperative consumption of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]; and time to first use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]) were 
also met, demonstrating prolonged analgesia and reduction of opi[INVESTIGATOR_482756].  
Robust nature of the efficacy results in both pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], 316 and 317, was demonstrated 
across subgroups of subjects with various prognostic features and across demographic 
subgroups.   
Study 331 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial of 
EXPAREL in adult subjects undergoing primary unilateral TKA under spi[INVESTIGATOR_790276] a field block.  Study 331 
compared EXPAREL 266 mg admixed with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 100 mg to an active comparator of 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 100 mg alone.  Seventy (70) subjects treated with EXPAREL+ bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 
69 subjects treated with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_790277].  The co-primary efficacy endpoints 
were the AUC of VAS from 12 to 48 hours and the total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (in oral morphine 
equivalents) from 0 to 48 hours.  The cumulative pain intensity in the EXPAREL + bupi[INVESTIGATOR_790278] (Mean AUC
12-48 = 180.8) was statistically significantly lower than the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_790279] (mean AUC 12-48 = 209.3), so the first co-primary efficacy endpoint was met (P = 0.0381).

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1088955]-2018 The LS geometric mean total opi[INVESTIGATOR_790280] 0 to 48 hours after surgery was 
statistically significantly lower in the EXPAREL + bupi[INVESTIGATOR_790281], so the second co-primary efficacy endpoint was met (16.7 mg vs 84.0 mg; P = 0.0029).  
In addition, EXPAREL was associated with a higher proportion of subjects who were opi[INVESTIGATOR_508830] 72 hours (10% vs 0%; P < 0.01) and also significantly prolonged the time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_790282] (median 4.1 hours vs 2.9 hours; P = 0.023) compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]. 
An analysis was performed to compare the incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related AEs between the 
EXPAREL and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_482758]-controlled, parallel-group infiltration 
studies in adults (SIMPLE TKA [total knee arthroplasty] 311, SKY0402-C-208, SIMPLE 
Hemorrhoidectomy 312, SKY0402-C-209, SKY0402-C-207, SKY0402-C-201, and SIMPLE 
Breast Augmentation 315).  There was a statistically significantly lower incidence of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related AEs in the EXPAREL ≤[ADDRESS_1088956] dose.  This was consistent with the statistically significantly lower total postoperative consumption of opi[INVESTIGATOR_790283] ≤[ADDRESS_1088957] dose.  
Fewer subjects in the EXPAREL ≤[ADDRESS_1088958] one opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related AE compared to 
the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124183] (25.6% versus 45.6%; p<0.0001).  The total opi[INVESTIGATOR_790284] (adjusted geometric mean) till [ADDRESS_1088959] dose was statistically significantly 
lower in the EXPAREL ≤266 mg group (7.94 mg) compared to the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124183] 
(15.84 mg); p<0.0001.  The EXPAREL >266 mg group did not show a statistically significant advantage favoring EXPAREL; the mean (standard deviation [SD]) of the average number of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related AEs per subject was 0.58 (0.522), and the total opi[INVESTIGATOR_482761] 
(adjusted geometric mean) till [ADDRESS_1088960] dose was 22.82 mg in the EXPAREL >266 mg 
group.

studies.   
7.5. Postmarketing Exposure in Adults and Children 
As of May-2018, more than [ADDRESS_1088961] received EXPAREL in the postmarketing 
setting.  While EXPAREL is not approved for use in patients less than 18 years of age, there is 
evidence that it has been widely used off-label in pediatric cases. 
The Premier PerspectiveTM Database ([COMPANY_003]) is the largest inpatient drug utilization database in 
the US and contains de-identified hospi[INVESTIGATOR_790285] 600 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], 
which accounts for approximately 15% of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_790286] ( McDonald 2013 ).  
Recent inquiries into the [COMPANY_003] between 01-Jan-2011 and 31-Mar- 2017 found that it contains data for 2461 patients aged less than 18 years who had been exposed to EXPAREL in both inpatient 
and outpatient settings, including 1796 patients between 6 and <17 years of age.   
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  402-C-319 (Pediatric Infiltration) 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1088962]-2018 In addition, The Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, Ohio) currently uses EXPAREL off-label as part 
of its postsurgical multimodal analgesia for patients under the age of 18 years across several 
surgical procedures.  A retrospective chart analysis is being conducted to evaluate the safety 
profile and clinical benefit of EXPAREL in this setting.

requiring intervention.  Neurologic AESIs include seizure, altered mental status/altered 
sensorium, rigidity, dysarthria, tremors, tinnitus, visual disturbance, and severe or worsening 
dizziness (see below).  Additionally, the following events may be of special interest if they 
persist or occur beyond [ADDRESS_1088971] dose: dizziness, hyperesthesia, muscular twitching, and 
tingling/paresthesia.  
Dizziness will be assessed as mild, moderate, or severe based on the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0.  Mild dizziness 
is defined as mild unsteadiness or sensation of movement; moderate dizziness is defined as 
moderate unsteadiness or sensation of movement limiting instrumental activities of daily living 
(ADL); and severe dizziness is defined as severe unsteadiness or sensation of movement that 
limits self-care ADLs.  Dizziness will be captured as an AESI if it is severe or worsens or persist 
beyond [ADDRESS_1088972] dose.  
Pharmacokinetic Assessment (Part 1 only) 
A population PK sampling scheme will be used to limit the number of blood draws for each 
individual subject.  On Day 1, eligible subjects will be assigned to one of the two PK sampling 
groups shown below based on surgery type (Table 2).  A total of [ADDRESS_1088973] clustering of PK samples.

CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1088974] Participation 
Participation will begin at the signing of the ICF/obtaining written assent.  No more than 30 days 
should pass between signing of the ICF/obtaining written assent and the administration of study 
drug.  The time from study drug administration till the end of participation is 30 ± [ADDRESS_1088975] 
If Pacira, the investigator, or officials from regulatory authorities discover conditions during the study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated, this action may be taken 
after Pacira has consulted with appropriate regulatory authorities and notified the investigator(s).  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be set up to monitor the safety and dosing data on 
an ongoing basis for all treatment groups, with additional expedited DSMB review conducted as 
necessary.   
9.4. Discussion of Study Design 
This study is designed to formulate specific guidance regarding dose for the safe administration 
of EXPAREL  in the pediatric population aged 6 to less than 17 years.  EXPAREL  doses 
recommended for adults are expressed as absolute values or ranges, whereas doses for pediatric subjects will be based on body weight, consistent with general prescription standards used in pediatric practice.  
A population PK modeling of the infiltration studies in adults and simulations to support 
child/adolescent dosing was performed.  Predicted values generated by [CONTACT_790316][INVESTIGATOR_790290].  According to this model, a dose of 4 mg/kg would produce bupi[INVESTIGATOR_790291] 6 to less than 17 years analogous to those observed in 
the adult infiltration studies.  
In addition, the available data from The Cleveland Clinic (as discussed in Section 7.5 ) shows that 
the average dose among 375 pediatric patients was 4.1 ± 1.8 mg/kg, with no significant AEs 
attributed to EXPAREL use.  This study is designed to further characterize the PK profile and to 
confirm the safety of the 4 mg/kg dose of EXPAREL. 
A population PK sampling scheme will be used to limit the number of blood draws.  A total of 
[ADDRESS_1088976]-dose time windows 
shown in Table 2 for the determination of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_608045].

1. Subjects whose parent(s) or guardian(s) has/have signed and dated the ICF for the subject 
to participate in the study, and subjects who ha ve provided written assent to participate in 
the study (if capable). 
2. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 1-3. 
3. Male or female subjects 6 to less than 17 years of age on the day of surgery. 
4. Body mass index (BMI) at screening within the 5th to 95th percentile for age and sex (see 
Appendix 5). 
5. A negative pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential must be available 
prior to the start of surgery.  The pregnancy test must be conducted in the preoperative 
holding area according to the study site’s standard of care.   
6. Subjects and their parent(s)/guardian(s) must be able to speak, read, and understand the 
language of the ICF and any instruments used for collecting subject-reported outcomes to 
enable accurate and appropriate responses to study assessments, and provide informed 
consent/assent.

CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1088979]-2018 7. Clinically significant medical or psychiatric disease that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], indicates an increased vulnerability to study drugs and/or procedures. 
8. Administration of an investigational drug within [ADDRESS_1088980]’s participation in this study. 
In addition, the subject will be ineligible to receive study drug if he or she meets the following criterion during surgery:  
9. Any clinically significant event or condition uncovered during the surgery 
(e.g., excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that might render the subject medically unstable or 
complicate the subject’s postoperative
 course.  
10.3. Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment 
Every reasonable effort should be made to maintain subject compliance and participation in the 
study.  Subjects who withdraw from the study after receiving study drug should undergo safety 
assessments till the end of the study (Day 30).   
If a subject who withdraws from the study has an ongoing AE, every effort must be made to 
follow such events until satisfactory resolution is obtained, or further follow-up is otherwise no 
longer warranted.  
10.3.1.Withdrawal Secondary to Adverse Events 
If a subject experiences an AE that renders him or her incapable of continuing with the 
remaining study assessments, then he or she will be discontinued from further participation in the 
study.  A final evaluation visit should be performed so that the subject’s study participation can 
be terminated in a safe and orderly manner.  Otherwise, the subject’s parent or guardian will be 
instructed to notify the study personnel of any abnormalities during the intervals between study 
visits and to come to the study site if medical evaluation is needed and the urgency of the 
situation permits.  Any subject exhibiting undesirable AEs will receive appropriate treatment at 
the discretion of the investigator.   
This study involves a single administration of the study drug; therefore, subjects should not be 
terminated from the ongoing study assessments as long as they are willing and able to continue 
with the follow-up schedule according to the protocol.  For emergencies and other unscheduled 
visits to a medical facility other than the study site, medical records will be obtained by [CONTACT_1275]. 
10.3.2.Voluntary or Study Investigator Withdrawal 
Subjects (or their parent or guardian) are free to discontinue participation in the study at any 
time, without prejudice to future treatment.  Nevertheless, subjects will be encouraged to 
complete at least the study safety assessments.  In addition, a subject may be discontinued from

resting heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oxygen saturation, and blood pressure) and any changes in the 
subject's health status will be recorded.   
After termination from the study, the subject may be followed for safety including monitoring of 
AEs till Day 30.   
11. TREATMENTS 
11.1. Treatments to be Administered 
Study Drug 
Dosing of EXPAREL for this study will be based on body weight, with a starting dose of 
4 mg/kg.  This weight-based dosing applies to Part [ADDRESS_1088982] document the 
size of the incision.  Each infiltration site should be spaced 1.0 to 1.5 cm apart and approximately 
1 to 1.5 mL should be delivered into both deep and superficial areas.  Following infiltration, the 
tissue should visibly expand with minimal leakage.   
All eligible subjects will receive a single dose of EXPAREL intraoperatively at the end of 
surgery via local infiltration into the surgical site.  EXPAREL can be administered as is or may 
be expanded with normal (0.9%) saline to increase the volume up to a final concentration of 
0.89 mg/mL (i.e., 1:14 dilution by [CONTACT_8544]).  The total volume of expansion will be dependent on 
the incision length.  Details regarding the expansion of EXPAREL are provided in the Study 
Drug Infiltration Guide. 
Total Volume of Expansion  
The investigator must document the total volume used for each surgery. 
xEXPAREL 4 mg/kg + normal saline (20–60 mL based on the incision size) = total 
volume. 
For example: If the infiltration sites are 1.5 cm apart, then a 10 cm incision would be 
10 × 2 sides × 3 layers = 60 cm.  If there is 1 mL infiltrated every 1.5 cm, the total 
volume would be 40 mL. 
In Part 1, all eligible subjects will receive a single dose of EXPAREL intraoperatively at the end of surgery via local infiltration.  EXPAREL can be administered as is or expanded to increase 
volume up to a final concentration of 0.89 mg/mL (i.e., 1:14 dilution by [CONTACT_8544]) with normal

size of the wound.   
In Part 2, all eligible subjects randomized to EXPAREL will receive a single dose of EXPAREL 
intraoperatively at the end of surgery via local infiltration.  Dosing will be informed by [CONTACT_790317] 1 and any recommendations based on the complete safety review. 
Subjects randomized to the active control group will receive bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 2 mg/kg, with a 
maximum dose of 175 mg. 
Postsurgical Pain Management 
The use of postsurgical pain medication in cases of insufficient analgesia is permitted according 
to the institution’s standard of care.  The investigator must record all pain management 
medications administered during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Avoid additional use of local anesthetics 
within 96 hours following administration of EXPAREL    
11.2. Administration Instructions/Procedures 
All injections must be performed with an infiltrative moving needle technique, with frequent 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_790292].  If an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_790293], the needle must be moved and placed in a different location until the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_790294].  The study drug should be infiltrated in small increments into both deep and superficial 
layers to ensure uniform distribution along the entire length of the surgical wound. 
11.2.1. Study Drug Administration Considerations 
As there is a potential risk of severe adverse effects associated with the administration of local 
anesthetics, the study site must be equipped to treat subjects with evidence of cardiac toxicity.   
EXPAREL may not be administered to a subject if the vial has been open for more than 4 hours.  
In order to prevent the study drug from settling, gently inverting and re-inverting the syringe 
several times prior to administration is recommended.  No agents should be admixed with 
EXPAREL.  
11.3. Identity of Investigational Products 
11.3.1.Description of EXPAREL 
EXPAREL is formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to off-white, preservative-free, 
homogeneous suspension of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338340]-based particles 
(the DepoFoam drug delivery system).   
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40521] a nominal concentration of 13.3 mg/mL.  EXPAREL will be provided 
in 20 mL, 1.3% (13.3 mg/mL) single-use, clear glass vials.   
EXPAREL vials should be stored refrigerated between 2°C and 8°C (36°F to 46°F).

frequency, and duration will be captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
11.3.3.Description of Diluents 
Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution) for injection will be used for the expansion of 
study drug.   
11.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment 
11.4.1. Randomization Scheme 
Approximately 90 subjects are planned for this study: [ADDRESS_1088985] is identified as being qualified to participate in the study (see Section 10 ), and is 
at the study site for surgery, the authorized site staff or designee will obtain a randomization 
assignment.  The subject will be considered randomized into the study once the study treatment 
assignment is received. 
11.4.3. Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study before receiving study drug may be replaced.  
Once assigned, subject numbers will not be reused; subjects enrolled to replace those who 
withdraw will be assigned a unique subject number. 
11.5. Selection of Doses in the Study 
The dose of EXPAREL  (4 mg/kg) was selected to provide similar exposure in pediatric subjects 
as was seen in adults.  A Population PK model was developed using all data obtained from the infiltration studies in adult subjects (SKY0402-C-201, SKY0402-C-208, SKY0402-C-316, 
SKY0402-C-317, and SKY0402-C-401).  Simulations from this model were performed to 
predict bupi[INVESTIGATOR_790295] [ADDRESS_1088986]. 
The selection of the 4 mg/kg dose is also supported by [CONTACT_790318], where [ADDRESS_1088987] received EXPAREL at a mean dose of 
4.1 ± 1.8 mg/kg, with no significant AEs attributed to EXPAREL use.

72, and 96 hours after the end of study drug administration; immediately prior to each 
administration of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_790298] 96 hours; and at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].  Pain intensity scores will be collected using the following instruments: 
x11-point NRS-R for subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years ( Appendix 1) 
xCAS for subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years ( Appendix 2 ) 
13.1.2.Neurological Examination 
A neurological assessment will be conducted during Part 1 only at the following time points: at 
screening; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours after the end of study drug administration; at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]; and on Day 30.  The examination will include the subject's 
orientation.  Additionally, subjects aged 6 years or older will be asked whether he or she is 
experiencing any numbness of the lips, the tongue, or around the mouth; hearing problems; or 
muscle twitching (see Appendix 3).  If the subject answers "yes" to any of these questions, the 
event should be recorded as an AE and additional safety procedures should be conducted as appropriate (see Section 13.1.7).    
13.1.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The scheduled clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be conducted 
at screening; baseline (on Day 1 prior to surgery); and at 96 hours after the end of study drug

CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1088996]-2018 13.1.4. Vital Signs 
The scheduled vital signs (temperature, resting heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oxygen saturation, 
and blood pressure) will be measured after the subject has rested in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 
5 minutes at screening; upon arrival at the PACU; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours 
after the end of study drug administration; at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]; and on Day 30.  Vital signs may 
also be measured if a subject experiences an AESI or an SAE (see Section 13.1.7).  The subject 
will remain in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_338349]. 
13.1.5.Physical Examination 
A full physical examination will be conducted at screening.  Superficial abnormalities that may 
interfere with participation in the study will be noted.  A follow-up physical examination will be 
conducted on Day 30 and will include examination of the surgical site.   
13.1.6.Electrocardiograms 
A 12-lead ECG will be conducted at screening or on Day 1 before surgery.  A 12-lead ECG 
according to the study site’s standard of care may also be conducted if a subject experiences an 
AESI or an SAE (see Section 13.1.7 ).   
13.1.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
All AEs will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed/assent is given till Day 30.  In case a 
cardiac or neurological AE of special interest (AESI) or serious AE (SAE) occurs during the 
study, if the investigator or medical monitor considers that the event may be related to study 
treatment or suggests the possible occurrence of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST; with 
or without the need for treatment [e.g., intralipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]]), or if a plausible etiology for the event cannot 
be found, an unscheduled PK blood sample must be collected and a 12-lead ECG, vital signs, 
and clinical laboratory tests (hematology and complete metabolic profile [CMP]) according to 
the study site’s standard of care may be conducted.  See Appendix [ADDRESS_1088997] pain, abnormal/irregular heart rate, and shortness of breath 
requiring intervention.  Neurologic AESIs include seizure, altered mental status/altered 
sensorium, rigidity, dysarthria, tremors, tinnitus, visual disturbance, and severe or worsening 
dizziness (see below).  Additionally, the following events may be of special interest if they 
persist or occur beyond [ADDRESS_1088998] dose: dizziness, hyperesthesia, muscular twitching, and 
tingling/paresthesia.  
Dizziness will be assessed as mild, moderate, or severe based on the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0.  
Mild dizziness is defined as mild unsteadiness or sensation of movement; moderate dizziness is 
defined as moderate unsteadiness or sensation of movement limiting instrumental ADL; and 
severe dizziness is defined as severe unsteadines s or sensation of movement that limits self-care 
ADLs.  Dizziness will be captured as an AESI if it is severe or worsens or persist beyond [ADDRESS_1088999] dose.

14. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
Consistent with the current regulatory guidance provided by [CONTACT_40583] [ADDRESS_1089009] of the study, those SAEs that may 
require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. 
See Section 13.1.7 for a description of AESIs. 
14.1. Adverse Events
14.1.1. Definitions
Adverse Event (AE) : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about 
causality.  An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use in combination with 
another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended change in a body structure or body function.  AEs 
include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status.  The AE may 
involve any organ or system and can be represented by [CONTACT_40584] a 
disease, a syndrome, a symptom, a physical sign, as well as by [CONTACT_321523].  Any medically relevant and untoward change 
after the subject signs the ICF, including frequency or pattern changes for a fluctuating condition 
(e.g., migraine) is considered an AE.   
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  402-C-319 (Pediatric Infiltration) 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1089010]-2018 An AE that occurs after the ICF is signed and before the start of the study drug administration is 
identified as a pre-treatment AE (PTAE).  An AE that occurs after the administration of the study 
treatment is considered a TEAE.   
Adverse Reaction: Any AE caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected 
adverse reactions for which there is a reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. Suspected Adverse Reaction: Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE.  For the purposes of Investigational New Drug (IND) safety reporting, 
"reasonable possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  Suspected adverse 
reactions are a subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the event. 
14.1.2. Recording Adverse Events 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs (i.e., PTAEs and TEAEs), with an 
onset after the subject signs the ICF.  For the purpose of this study, all AEs that occur till Day [ADDRESS_1089011] be recorded regardless of whether or not they are considered related to the study drug.  
Whenever feasible, AE terms should be documented as medical diagnoses (highest possible level 
of integration); otherwise, the AEs should be reported separately as individual signs or 
symptoms.  Only one AE per line should be recorded in the AE case report form (CRF); for 
example, an AE of nausea and vomiting should be listed as two separate events: the event of 
nausea and the event of vomiting.  If a diagnosis is established after symptoms are recorded on 
the AE CRF, the diagnosis should be recorded and the symptoms collapsed (removed; i.e., lined 
through and initialed).  Whenever possible, abnormal laboratory results should be reported as their clinical corollary (e.g., low potassium should be recorded as hypokalemia). 
A continuous AE with varying grades of severity should be recorded as one AE.  The highest 
grade of severity experienced by [CONTACT_790320]. 
Any condition noted before the subject signs the ICF will be listed as medical history and is 
considered a pre-existing condition.  If a pre-existing condition changes (i.e., becomes more 
severe or more frequent) at any time after the ICF is signed, or after study drug administration, 
it is considered an AE.  Note: A change in treatment for a pre-existing condition (e.g., new high 
blood pressure medication) does not necessarily indicate an AE. 
Information recorded on the AE CRF will include the AE term, the date and time of onset, 
severity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, action taken with subject due to an AE, and the 
outcome of the AE, including the date and time of resolution, if applicable.   
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  402-C-319 (Pediatric Infiltration) 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1089012]-2018 14.1.3. Severity of Adverse Events 
In general, the severity of an AE should be categorized using the following guidelines:  
Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities. 
Moderate: An AE that is discomforting and interferes with normal everyday activities. 
Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities. 
The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as "serious," which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject's life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations. 
14.1.4.Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug 
The investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to study drug after careful medical 
consideration on a case-by-case basis.  General guidelines for determining the causality of an AE 
to the study drug are provided below: 
Unrelated: A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE can be easily ruled out 
(e.g., based on the temporal sequence, absence of a reasonable pathophysiological 
mechanism, or direct evidence of actual cause). 
Unlikely:  A clinical event with a temporal relationship to study drug administration which 
makes a causal relationship improbable and in which other drugs, chemicals, or 
underlying disease provide a plausible explanation. 
Possible: A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study 
drug but which could also be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. 
Probable: A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study 
drug unlikely to be attributed to a concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals 
and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Definite:  The pharmacological properties of the study drug(s) or of the substance class, and 
the course of the AE after dechallenge and, if applicable, after rechallenge, and/or 
specific test indicate involvement of the study drug(s) in the 
occurrence/worsening of the AE, and no indication of other causes exists. 
14.1.5. Outcome of Adverse Events 
The investigator will assess the outcome of the AE after careful medical consideration, on a 
case-by-case basis.  General guidelines are provided below: 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  402-C-319 (Pediatric Infiltration) 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1089013]-2018 Recovered/Resolved: The event resolved and the subject recovered from the AE. 
Recovered/Resolved 
with Sequelae: The initial event resolved, but has a continuing abnormal condition 
as a result of the AE. 
Not Recovered/ 
Not Resolved: At the time of the last assessment, the event was ongoing, with an undetermined outcome.  Note: ongoing AEs are not to be considered 
resolved as a result of death. 
Recovering/Resolving: At the time of the last assessment, the event was decreasing in 
frequency, severity, etc., and a resolution was expected. 
Fatal: The AE directly caused death. 
Unknown: There was an inability to access the subject or the subject’s records to determine the outcome (e.g., subject withdrew consent or was 
lost to follow-up). 
14.1.6. Action Taken with Subject Because of an Adverse Event 
The investigator will provide any actions taken regarding the subject (e.g., treatment, diagnostic 
tests, laboratory tests, or therapy) for each reported AE. 
xNone. 
xMedication. 
xNon-pharmaceutical therapy.  (The specific therapy used must be recorded in the CRF.) 
xDiscontinued from study. 
xOther.  (The specific action taken must be recorded in the CRF.) 
14.2. Serious Adverse Events 
14.2.1.Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in 
the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
xDeath1 
xA life-threatening adverse event2 
xInpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]3 
xA persistent or significant incapacity4 
xCongenital anomaly/birth defect 
xMedically significant5 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  402-C-319 (Pediatric Infiltration) 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1089014]-2018 1Death: Any event resulting in a subject’s death must be reported as an SAE.  However, death, 
in and of itself, is not an AE; it is an outcome.  The cause of death is the AE.  Therefore, the 
investigator should make every effort to obtain and document the cause of death for all subjects 
who die during the study.  If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510], the cause of death remains unknown, the AE 
should be documented as an “unspecified fatal event.” 
2Life-threatening : An AE is considered life-threatening if, in the view of either the investigator 
or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an 
AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
3Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : It should be noted that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], in and of itself, does not represent an 
SAE.  It is the AE leading to the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40541] “serious” when it 
requires inpatient care.  Consequently, an SAE should not be reported in case of preplanned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the study.  However, 
any medical condition that delays a subject’s discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (i.e., prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) or requires the subject to be readmitted should be reported as an SAE.  
4Persistent or significant incapacity:  A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
5Medically Significant : Important medical events that may not result in death, 
be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such 
medically significant events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
14.2.2.Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE or death that occurs at any time after the subject signs the ICF through Day 30, 
whether or not related to EXPAREL, must be reported by [CONTACT_790321] 24 hours of discovery by [CONTACT_40587] ( [EMAIL_780] ) or fax 
([PHONE_10100]).  In addition, the investigator or designee is encouraged to contact [CONTACT_479030], as needed.   
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying Pacira Drug Safety or designee of the SAE.  The fax or email report should be 
followed by a full written summary using the SAE Form detailing relevant aspects of the SAE 
in question.  Where applicable, information from relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_790303]-identifying information redacted prior to forwarding to Pacira.  
In the event of a fatal or life-threatening SAE, any required follow-up must be provided to Pacira 
Drug Safety or designee immediately.  The investigator will follow all SAEs until resolved or the 
condition stabilizes and further follow-up is not warranted. 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  402-C-319 (Pediatric Infiltration) 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1089015]-2018 If the investigator is made aware of any SAEs after Day 30, these should also be reported to 
Pacira Drug Safety or designee, provided the SAE is considered related to EXPAREL.  The site 
would then provide a completed SAE form within 1 business day and the event would be 
followed until resolution, or until adequate stabilization is met.  
15. STATISTICAL METHODS 
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed for this study.   
15.1. Study Hypothesis 
No formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. 
15.2. Study Endpoints  
The endpoints to be assessed in this study are listed in Section 12.2 (Pharmacokinetic 
Endpoints), Section 12.4 (Safety Endpoints), and Section 12.6 (Other Endpoints). 
15.3. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size was based on the number of subjects necessary to characterize the PK profile of 
EXPAREL in pediatric subjects with the precision required by [CONTACT_1622]. 
15.4. Analysis Populations 
The following study populations are planned:  
xThe PK population will consist of all subjects who receive study drug and provide at least one quantifiable plasma concentration.  
xThe safety population will consist of all subjects who underwent the planned surgery and received study treatment.   
15.5. Handling Subject Dropouts and Discontinuations 
Subjects who discontinue after dosing will not be replaced. 
15.6. Statistical Analyses 
Continuously valued data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n [number of subjects 
contributing data], mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum).  Discretely valued data will be tabulated (n and percentage) by [CONTACT_17203].  The denominator for all percentages will be the 
number of subjects who underwent the planned surgery. 
15.6.1.Baseline Characteristics 
Baseline characteristics will be summarized or tabulated as appropriate. 
15.6.2.Efficacy Analyses 
Pain intensity scores will be summarized by [CONTACT_7206].   
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  402-C-319 (Pediatric Infiltration) 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1089016] modeling 
with NONMEM® software ( Beal 2011 ) will be used to analyze the sparse 
concentration-versus-time data.  Population and individual PK parameters will be estimated.  Individual PK parameters estimated for each subject will be used to compute PK exposures 
(AUC and C
max).  PK parameters will be presented in listings and descriptive summary statistics, 
including the arithmetic mean, median, range, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation.  Details and results of this mixed-effects modeling analysis will be reported separately. 
15.6.4. Safety Analyses 
The incidence of AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6657].  Subjects 
reporting the same AE more than once will be counted only once within each tabulation category 
for that AE. 
15.7. Significance Testing 
Not applicable.

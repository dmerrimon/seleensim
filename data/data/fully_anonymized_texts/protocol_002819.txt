2/Protocol CO40151, Version 6PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION [ADDRESS_750702] 
recent Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure (Version 17).  Changes to the protocol, 
along with a rationale for each change, are summarized below:
Section 1.3 has been updated to indicate that Atezolizumab is also approved for the 
treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, and melanoma .
It has been clarified that patients will not be allowed to make up missed doses of 
ipatasertib and atezolizumab study drugs andshould resume dosing at their next 
scheduled dose. If clinically possible, patients should receive 4doses of 
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and [ADDRESS_750703] of care (Section 3.1.7) .
Two changes specifically for Cohort 3 in response to Medicines and Healthcare 
Products Regulatory Agency feedback in the Version 5 ([LOCATION_008] )have also 
been added to the global study protocol .  These two changes are as follows : 
–Text has been modified to state that l ive, attenuated vaccines areprohibited
with cyclophosphamide treatment:  Live, attenuated vaccines are prohibited 
within [ADDRESS_750704] dose of cyclophosphamide, whichever 
occurs later (Section 4.4.3) .
–An ECG will be assessed during screening, ateach doxorubicin administration 
(Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 12), at the study completion/early terminiation visit ,
and as clinic ally indi cated .  Screening ECG assessments obtained 48hours 
before Day [ADDRESS_750705] to be repeated on Day 1 of Cycle 1
(Section 4.5.8 and Appendix 3).
Section 4.5.7 has been updated to allow investigators to obtain NGS report from 
baseline and/or at the time of disease progression, after the patient has 
discontinued study treatment.
List of identified risks for atezolizumab has been revised to include severe 
cutaneous adverse reac tions (Section 5.1.2).
Guidelines for management of atezolizumab -associa ted dermatologic adverse 
events have been revised to provide guidance on severe cutaneous adverse 
reactions of Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS], Table 6, and Appendix 13).
To address a request by [CONTACT_70080] (ANSM), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and 
macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) have replaced systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome on the list of atezolizumab -associated adverse events of special 
interest (Section 5.2.3) .
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
3/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Language has been added to clarify that if a patient experiences both a local and 
systemic reaction to a single administration of study treatment, each reaction should 
be recorded separ ately on the Adverse Event eCRF (Sect ion5.3.5).
Language has been added to clarify that adverse events associated with aspecial 
situation that also qualify as adverse events of special interest should be reported 
within 24 hours (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) .
Language has been updated to indicate thatresolution of adverse events (with 
dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s 
medical record to facilitate source data verification during the adverse event 
reporting period (Section 5.5.1) .
The list of study records and documents to be retained by [CONTACT_571795] (Section 7.5).
A new section has been added to describe the implementation of a system to 
manage the quality of the study (Section 9.3).
The name [CONTACT_4007] a [COMPANY_002] policy on data sharing has been corrected (Section 9.6).
It has been clarified that hematology and fasting serum chemistry lab oratory 
assessment s are not required on Days 8 and 22 during Cycles 1 2 because 
nochemotherapy infusions are being given on these days.  Other assessments 
such as vital signs, weight, and assessment of adverse events, concomitant 
medications, and review of the patient diary are still required on Days 8 and 22 
during Cycle s 12 as indicated in the protocol. It has also been clarified that 
screeni ng local laboratory assessments obtained 48hours before Day [ADDRESS_750706] to be repeated on Day1 of Cycle 1 (Appendix 3).
Appendix 11has been revised to indicate that caution should be used when 
considering atezolizumab for patients who hav e previously experienced a severe or 
life-threatening skin adverse reaction while receiving another immunostimulatory 
anti-cancer agent.
The management guidelines for Grade [ADDRESS_750707] of care for patients that are suspected of 
presenting signs or symptoms suggestive of myocarditis (Appendix 13).  The 
guidelines are also summarized in Section 6.7.6 of the IB.
To address a request by [CONTACT_70082], t he management guidelines for 
infusion- related reactions associated with atezolizumab have been updated to 
include guidelines for cytokine -release syndrome (CRS) to align with the definition, 
grading, and management of CRS reflected in a recent publication (Lee et al. 2019) 
(Appendix 13).
To address a request by [CONTACT_70082], the management guidelines for HLH 
and MAS have been modified to indicate that HLH should be considered when CRS 
presentation is atypi[INVESTIGATOR_123467], to add anticytokine therapy as an option for 
treating HLH or MAS, and to suggest that published guidelines should be followed 
for HLH or MAS events that do not respond to treatment within 24 hours 
(Appendix 13).
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
4/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Language has been added to clarify that hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and 
macrophage activation syn drome are considered potential risks for atezolizumab 
(Appendix 13).
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.  This amendment represents

Study Design
Description of Study
This is a Phase Ib, open -label, multicenter study consisting of four cohorts.  In Cohort 1, the 
safety and efficacy  of ipatasertib atezolizumab paclitaxel (Ipat Atezo Pac) and 
ipatasertib atezolizumab nab-paclitaxel (Ipat Atezo Nab-Pac) will be evaluated in patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have not previously received chemotherapy in 
the advanced setting.   In Cohort 2 (biopsy cohort), IpatAtezo (with nochemotherapy) will be 
administered in the second -line and third -line setting to patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic TNBC for the main purpose of conducting exploratory biomarker assessments.  In 
Cohort 3, the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant ipatasertib atezolizumab doxorubicin 
cyclophosphamide ( IpatAtezo AC) followed by [CONTACT_571796] Atezo Pac will be evaluated in patients 
with locally advanced T2 4 TNBC.  In Cohort 4, the safety and efficacy  of Ipat Atezo Pac will 
be evaluated in patients with PD -L1positive locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have 
not previously received chemotherapy in the advanced setting.
There is a known and acceptable safety profile of ipatasertib with paclitaxel and at ezolizumab 
with paclitaxel or nab- paclitaxel.  If an unexpected safety signal is detected at any time, doublet

occurs later, to avoid exposing the embry o.
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1%per year, when used 
consistently and correctly, include combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) 
hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, proges togen -only 
hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, bilateral tubal occlusion, 
male sterilization, intrauterine hormone -releasing system, and sexual abstinence.

Non-Investigational Medicinal Products
Because of the known potential for allergic reactions to paclitaxel and/or the 
Cremophorvehicle, precautions must be taken to decrease the risk of anaphylaxis.  Patients 
must be premedicated prior to paclitaxel with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and an 
H2-receptor blocker (i.e., ranitidine or famotidine) or per institutional practice. H2-receptor 
antagonists, such as cimetidine, which are known to inhibit cytochrome P450, are excluded.
In general, chemotherapy supportive care should be administered per ASCO, European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, or European Society fo r Medical Oncology 
guidelines or institutional practice .  In Cohort 3, filgrastim or pegfilgrastim must be used in 
conjunction with each AC administration.  Chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting 
prophylaxis and treatment should be administered as clinic ally indicated.  It is highly 
recommended that aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_571765]/or 
vomiting.  Because s ystemic corticosteroids may attenuate the potential beneficial immunologic 
effects of treatment with atezolizumab, al ternative agents should be considered when clinically 
feasible.
To improve diarrhea management and patient experiences, loperamide (2 mg twice a day) will 
be administered daily as prophylaxis for diarrhea in the first cy cle.  If side effects are not 
tolera ted, doses may be reduced.  Investigators are encouraged to continue this dosing for the 
remainder of the study using their discretion based on clinical judgments.
Because of the risk of rash, patients should receive the following prophylactic treatment, u nless 
contraindicated, during the first cy cle in which all three study treatments (ipatasertib, 
atezolizumab, and taxane) are to be given in Cohorts [ADDRESS_750740] 28 days (i.e., 
Weeks 14) in which all four study treatments (ipatasertib, atez olizumab, and AC) are to be 
given in Cohort 3:  On days when patients will receive atezolizumab, patients should receive at 
least 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) as premedication, followed by a fixed dose of 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
30/Protocol CO40151, Version 610mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for 2 [ADDRESS_750741] cy cle in which all three treatments 
(four treatments for Cohort 3) are to be given.  It is suggested that a non -sedating oral 
antihistamine (such as loratadine, cetirizine, or fexofenadine) and a longer -acting fo rmulation be 
used.  Protocol -required premedication should be omitted on the day of paclitaxel infusion if 
already administered as taxane premedication per institutional practice.
Statistical Methods
Primary A nalysis
Objective Response Rate
Objective respo nse rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed 
complete response or partial response on two consecutive occasions [ADDRESS_750742] an objective response; an estimate of ORR will be calculated for each 
treatment arm, and its 95% CI will be calculated using the Clopper Pearson method. 
Duration of Response
Duration of response (DOR) will be analyzed to support ORR.  DOR is defined as the time from 
the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression, as determined 
by [CONTACT_3143] v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  
Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analy sis will be censored at the las t 
disease assessment date.
Determination of Sample Size
There is no formal hypothesis testing planned. The determination of sample size for each 
cohort is described below.
Cohorts 1 and 3 :  Safety Run -In Stage
In Cohorts 1 and 3, the number of patients enrolled during the safety run -in stage (n 6) in each 
arm (i.e., A1, B1, C1, D1 , F1, and G1 ) allows for a reasonable likelihood of observing a given 
adverse event in at least 1 patient even when the incidence of the specific adverse event is low 
Cohort 1:  Expansion Stage
No formal statistical hypothesis testing is planned in this study.  Instead, the analysis here is for 
hypothesis generation, and the emphasis is on estimations.  To ev aluate the primary endpoint 
of overall response rate for Cohort 1 , for each arm, the analyses will be based on combining 
patients enrolled in the safety run -in and expansion stages, which is approximately 20 patients 
(Cohort 1, Arms A and B) or 12 patients (Cohort 1, Arms C and D).  Twenty patients provide 
reasonably reliable estimates for hypothesis generation in the expansion stage inArms A and 
B. Twelve patients will provide reasonably reliable estimates for hy pothesis generation in the 
expansion stage inArms C and D.
Cohort 2:  Biopsy
If there is sufficient evidence of meaningful benefit from the combination of ipatasertib and 
atezolizumab with taxane in Cohort 1, (e.g., ORR 50%), the Sponsor may  decide to open 
enrollment of a separate mandatory on -treatment biopsy  cohort to evaluate biomarker endpoints 
of patients treated with ipatasertib combined with atezolizumab to further understand the 
molecular basis of treatment benefit.  To provide a reliable estimate of the effects of ipatasertib 
and ipatas ertib atezolizumab on immune cell infiltration and activation, as well as molecular 
tumor biomarkers and circulating immune cell repertoires, a total of up to 14 patients will be 
enrolled in this cohort for explorator y analyses.
Cohort 3:  Expansion Stag e
No formal statistical hypothesis testing is planned in this study.  Instead, the analysis here is for 
hypothesis generation, and the emphasis is on estimations.  To evaluate the primary efficacy 
endpoint of pCR for Cohort 3, for each arm, the analyses will be based on combining patients 
enrolled in the safety run -in stage (n 6) and expansion stage (n 6 or 12, as determined by [CONTACT_429]) for a total of either 12 patients or 18 patients.   The minimum sample size, 12 patients, 
will provide reasonably r eliable estimates for hypothesis generation in the expansion stage in 
Arms F and G.  Any additional patients will strengthen the evidence by [CONTACT_571802].
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
31/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Cohort 4
No formal statistical hypothesis testing is planned in this study.  Patient s from Cohort 4 
(approximately 50 patients with PD -L1positive tumors) will be pooled with approximately 
40patients with PD -L1positive tumors in Cohort 1.  The total sample size for this pooled 
analysis is expected to be approximately 90 patients, which will provide a reasonably reliable 
estimate for the ORR in the PD- L1positive population compared with historical data in this 
population.

common cause of cancer -related mortality in women, with a 5- year survival rate 
following metastatic diagnosis of appro ximately 15% (Jemal et al. 2011; Ferlay et al. 
2015).  
Triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 20% of all breast 
cancers and is defined by [CONTACT_571803] (ER), 
progesterone receptor (PgR), and non- amplif ied HER2 expression (per American 
Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCO] /College of American Pathologists [CAP] guidelines 
[ASCO -CAP 2010; 2013 ]).  Patients with metastatic TNBC exhibit a particularly poor 
clinical outcome, generally with rapid progression and a median overall survival (OS) 
rate of approximately 16 months (Rodler et al. 2010; Miles et al. 2013).  Although TNBC 
may respond to chemotherapy, including taxanes, there are no approved first -line 
regimens or targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_571766].  
Because of an increase in toxicity and little survival benefit with combination 
chemotherapy, treatment with sequential single agents is generally preferred 
(Cardoso et al. 2017 ;NCCN 2017).  There is a pressing need for clinically active agents 
for the triple- negative subtype of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) .
Both National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN; 2017) and the European Society 
for Medical Oncology ( ESMO ;2016) (clinical practice guidelines cite p aclitaxel as an 
appropriate first -line regimen, with a median progression -free survival (PFS) of 
approximately 6 months in patients with TNBC ( Miles et al. 2013 ;Miles et al. 2017).  The 
response rates for paclitaxel a dministered as a single agent to pati ents with MBC are 
approximately 25% in first -line t reatment (W ilson et al. 1994; Seidman et al. 1995;
Nabholtz et al. 1996 ;Gradishar et al. 2005).
Nanoparticle albumin -bound (nab) -paclitaxel is an albumin -bound formulation of 
paclitaxel that was developed to avoid the toxicities associated with the vehicles that are 
necessary for parenteral administration of solvent -based (sb) -paclitaxel (polyethylated 
castor oil and polysorbate 80). Nab-paclitaxel can be administered without steroid or 
antihistamine preme dication. Based on the results of the randomized Phase III study in 
which patients received either nab -paclitaxel or sb- paclitaxel (control) administered 
every 3 weeks ( Q3W) (n460; Gradishar et al. 2005), nab -paclitaxel was approved for 
the treatment o f MBC after failure of front -line combination chemotherapy for metastatic 
disease or relapse within [ADDRESS_750745] cancer (Cardoso et al. 2017; NCCN 2017). 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
36/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Early -stage TNBC accounts for 10%20% of all new diagnoses of early breast cancer 
(EBC),defined as Stages IIII (Lehmann et al. 2011; Howlader et al. 2016).  Three- year 
event -freesurvival (EFS) rates of74%76% have been reported for patients with TNBC 
who have received neoadjuvant anthracycline -and taxane -containing therapy 
(Sikov etal. 2016 ).  Upon relapse, patients with metastatic TNBC have poor outcomes, 
with rapid progression and decreased OS (Kassam et al. 2009).
Multi-agent chemotherapy regimens have proven benefit as neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
therapy for early -stage TNBC, improving both disease- specific and OS outcomes 
(Berry et al. 2006; Senkus et al. 2015; NCCN 2016).  It is currently recommended that 
chemotherapy be given preoperatively (neoadjuvant) or postoperatively (adjuvant) to 
reduce the risk of relapse inpatients with early -stage TNBC.
The most effective chemotherapy combinations used for early -stage TNBC include 
anthracyclines, topoisomerase II inhibitors, platinum agents, cyclophosphamide, and/or 
taxanes (Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group 2005; Peto et al. 2012).  
Studies looking at optimizing the dose and schedule of EBC chemotherapy regimens 
(Citron et al. 2003; Sparano et al. 2008; Budd et al. 2015) have established one of the 
optimal regimens with respect to maximizing efficacy as doxorubicin 60 mg/m2and 
cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2administered every 2 weeks (Q2 W) for fourcycles, 
followed by [CONTACT_114461] 80 mg/m2administered once a week for 12 weeks .  This regimen 
is included as a preferred option in international guide lines (Senkus et al. 2015; 
NCCN 2016).
However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_571767] -or taxane -based therapy, 
approximately 30% 40% of patients with clinically localized TNBC at diagnosis develop 
metastatic disease and die of the cancer (Haffty et al. 2006; Tan et al. 2008; Budd et al. 
2015).  Thus, there is a substantial need to improve long -term treatment outcomes for 
patients with early -stage TNBC.
PI3K/A kt Pathway  in Breast Cancer
The phosphoinositide 3- kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway is more frequently 
activated by [CONTACT_294825] 
(LoRusso 2016).  The most common genetic alterations in this pathway are activati ng 
mutations of phosphatidylinositol -4, 5bisphosphate 3 -kinase, catalytic subunit, alpha
(PIK3CA) , loss -of-function alterations of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin 
homolog ( PTEN ), deregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and amplificatio n 
and mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012 ;
Millis et al. 2015).  Alterations in Akt itself, including amplification and overexpression of 
individual Akt isoforms, as well as activating mutations in Akt, have been identi fied in 
asubset of human cancers (Bellacosa et al. 2005; Brugge et al. 2007; Tokunaga et al. 
2008). All of these mechanisms of pathway activation ultimately funnel through Akt as 
the central node that drives cell survival, growth, proliferation, angiogen esis, metabolism, 
and migration (Manning and Cantley 2007). 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
37/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Large -scale comprehensive genomic analyses have characterized the heterogeneous 
nature of TNBC, including a subgroup with a PI3K/Akt pathway activation signature 
[CONTACT_571868] [CONTACT_23587]3CA or AKT1 activating mutations and PTEN alterations ( Cancer 
Genome Atlas Network 2012).  Overall, PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors are 
frequently observed in breast cancer, and are reported in approximately 35% of patients 
with TNBC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012) .  
1.2 BACKGROUND ON IPATASERTIB
Ipatasertib is a potent, highly selective small -molecule inhibitor of all three isoforms of 
the serine/threonine kinase Akt.  Ipatasertib binds to the activated conformation of Akt and 
is adenosine triphosphate competitive .  Ipatasertib binding inhibits the kinase activity of 
Akt and suppresses the phosphorylation of its direct substrates, including PRAS40, and 
additional downstream targets, such as S6 ribosomal protein, resulting in G 1arrest 
and/or apoptosis in human cancer c ells (Lin et al. 2012).  In clinical tumor samples, 
robust Akt pathway inhibition by [CONTACT_571804] 
(Yan et al. 2013).
Up-regulation of Akt signaling (whether intrinsic or induced following chemotherapy) 
represents a potentially important survival pathway in response to genotoxic/mitotic 
stress (Xu et al. 2012).  Activation of Akt signaling following chemotherapy (including 
taxanes) may promote cell survival and chemoresistance across several cancer models, 
includin g breast cancer (Clark et al. 2002 ).  Conversely, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt 
pathway in diverse cancers leads to radiosensitization and/or chemosensitization
(Brognard et al. 2001; Solit et al. 2003 ;Wallin et al. 2010).
In nonclinical models with high lev els of phosphorylated Akt  or PI3K/Akt pathway activity 
(i.e., PIK3CA mutation, PTEN alterations), sensitivity to ipatasertib has been observed 
across different tumor models, including breast cancers (Lin et al. 2013).  Additionally, 
ipatasertib plus microtubule inhibitors or DNA -damaging chemotherapeutic agents 
showed a clear advantage over respective single- agent treatment in preclinical models 
(refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure for further information).  
Based on the scientific rationale that PI3K/Akt blockade attenuates survival signals 
associated with mitotic stress fr om treatment with microtubule inhibitors and the high 
prevalence of PI3K/Akt pathwa y activation signatures in TNBC (Cancer Genome Atlas 
Network 2012), clinical trials evaluating the preliminary safety and efficacy of the 
combination of ipatasertib and pacl itaxel in patients with breast cancer have been 
conducted.  These trials include a Phase Ib study with an expansion cohort of patients 
with HER2 -negative breast cancer (Study PAM4983g, Arm C) ,a randomized Phase II 
study (Study GO29227, LOTUS) comparing ip atasertib paclitaxel versus 
placebo paclitaxel as first -line treatment for patients with inoperable locally advanced 
ormetastatic TNBC , and a randomized Phase II study (FAIRLANE) comparing 
neoadjuvant ipatasertib paclitaxel versus placebo paclitax el in patients with early 
TNBC (defined as T1.5 cm, N0 2).

38/Protocol CO40151, Version 6In the Phase Ib study PAM4983g, 3 of the 15 patients (20%) with breast cancer 
remained progression free for 6 months (hormone receptor
[HR]-positive/ HER2 -negative : n2; TNBC: n1), and 4 partial responses included 
patients who had prior exposure to paclitaxel or investigational PI3K inhibitors 
(HR-positive /HER2 -negative : n2; TNBC: n2).
In the randomized Phase II study GO29227, one of the objectives was to investigate the 
adde d benefit of ipatasertib to paclitaxel in the subgroup of patients with 
PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors. Results from this study showed improvement in 
median PFS in the intent -to-treat ( ITT) population (hazard ratio 0.60; 6.2 months in the 
ipatasertib arm compared with 4.9 months in the control arm ); and more pronouncedly in 
the pre-specified patient population with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors (hazard 
ratio0.44; 9 months vs. 4.9 months).
In the Phase II FAIRLANE study, pathologic complete respons e (pCR) rate, defined as 
ypT0/Tis ypN0, following administration of ipatasertib paclitaxel versus 
placebo paclitaxel was 17% versus 13% , respectively, in the ITTpopulation (n 151)
and 18% versus 12%, respectively, in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered population 
(n62). Complete response rate following administration of ipatasertib paclitaxel 
versus placebo paclitaxel was 28% versus 13%, respectively, in the ITT population and 
39% versus 9%, respectively, in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered populatio n.
Common adverse events associated with ipatasertib include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
stomatitis/mucosal inflammation, asthenia, hyperglycemia, and rash.  No new safety 
findings were identified with the combination with paclit axel.   For benefit risk 
assessments of study treatments, refer to Section 1.4.
Refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator's Brochure for details on nonclinical and clinical 
studies, including single- agent activities in the Phase I study (PAM4743g).
1.3 BACKGROUND ONATEZOLI ZUMA B
Atezolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets PD -L1 and inhibits 
the interaction between PD -L1 and its receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1 (also known as CD80), 
both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells.  Therapeutic 
blockade of PD -L1 binding by [CONTACT_123479] -specific T -cell responses, resulting in improved anti -tumor activity 
(Fehrenbacher et al. 2016; Rosenberg et al. 2016).  Atezolizumab has minimal binding 
to Fc receptors, thus eliminating detectable Fc -effector function and associated 
antibody -mediated clearance of activated effector T cells.
Atezolizumab shows anti -tumor activity in both nonclinical models and patients with 
cancer and is being investigated as a potential therapy in a wide variety of malignancies.  
Atezolizumab is being studied as a single agent in the advanced cancer and adjuvant 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
39/Protocol CO40151, Version 6therapy settings, as well as in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and 
cancer immunotherapy (CIT) .
Atezolizumab is approved for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma, non small cell lung 
cancer, small -cell lung cancer , TNBC , hepatocellular carcinoma, and melanoma .
In metastatic TNBC, combination treatment with nab -paclitaxel showed promising 
activity in the Phase 1b study GP28328. Arm F (atezolizumab 800 mg IV 
Q2Wnab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m221-day on/7 -day off dosing schedule ) of the six 
treatment arms in this Phase Ib study evaluated preliminary anti-tumor activity of 
patients with metastatic TNBC. As of the clinical cut -off date of 14 January 2016, 
32patients with metastatic TNBC across various lines of therapy were evaluable for 
efficacy:  first line 13patients ; second line9patients , third line  10patients .  
Overall, the investigator -assessed objective response rate ( ORR) per Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 ( RECIST v1.1) was 37.5% (confirmed 
responses). Clinical benefit was observed across all lines of th erapy, with first-line and 
third-linepatients having ORRs that were comparable (46.2% and 40.0%, respectively).  
The one complete response of the [ADDRESS_750746] generally been manageable. According to data available from the metastatic 
TNBC cohort in Study GP28328 (atezo lizumab in combination with nab -paclitaxel), the 
most commonly occurring adverse events ( 30% incidence) have been fatigue, 
diarrh ea,nausea, constipation, alopecia ,peripheral sensory neuropathy ,pyrexia, cough, 
decreased neutrophil count ,peripheral neuropathy ,and neutropenia.
Safety findings of single -agent atezolizumab across multiple tumor types in the clinical 
develo pment program are consistent with the known mechanism of action of 
atezolizumab and the underlying disease.  Overall, treatment with atezolizumab is well 
tolerated, with a manageable adverse event profile.  Currently, no maximum tolerated 
dose, no dose -limiting toxicities, and no clear dose -related trends in the incidence of 
adverse events have been determined.   Across all studies and tumor types, the most 
commonly reported adverse events with single -agent atezolizumab include fatigue, 
nausea, decreased app etite, diarrhea, constipation, and cough.  
Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for details on nonclinical and clinical 
studies.
1.4 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT RISK A SSESSMENT
TNBC remains a challenging disease. Outcomes for patients with high- risk primary 
TNBC remain relatively poor compared withthose of other breast cancer subtypes. 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
40/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment ,but benefits are frequently short -lived 
with rapid development of resistance. Approximat ely 40% of pa tients receiving 
neoadjuvant anthracycline -andtaxane -based chemotherapy achieve a pCR ( ypT0 ypN0 
or ypT0/is ypN0). The literature supports the existence of a correlation between pCR 
and long- term cl inical benefit with regard to EFS hazard ratio for patients achieving pCR 
vs. patients not achieving pCR : 0.24 [ 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.33 ]) and OS(hazard ratio for 
patients achieving pCR vs. patients not achieving pCR :0.16 [95% CI: 0.11 to 0.25 ])
(Cortazar et al. 2014). Whileseveral randomized tri als and a meta- analysis of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy have demonstrated that TNBC ismore chemo- sensitive than
other breast cancer subtypes , as demonstrated by[CONTACT_571805], patients with TNBC still have a poo rer prognosis overall, as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_571806]. The 
poor long -term outcome in TNBC has been found to be driven by [CONTACT_571807] a pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, making it a clinical priority to develop 
new treatment strategies that can improve pCR rates in TNBC. 
For patients with metastatic TNBC, clinical outcome is particularly poor, generally with 
rapid progression and a median OS of approximately 16 months (Rodler et al. 2010; 
Miles et al. 2013). Although chemotherapy is a mainstay treatment, resistance inevitably 
develops and benefit is often short -lived.
Results of the Phase II randomized s tudy GO29227 demonstrated that adding 
ipatasertib to paclitaxel as first -line therapy for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic 
TNBC improves PFS in the ITT and in PTEN -low populations; the PFS improvement was 
more pronounced in pa tients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors identified with the 
FoundationOnenext-generation sequencing ( NGS) assay (representing approximately 
40% of the randomized patients in this setting).   
CIT has demonstrated extraordinary success, with significa nt survival benefits observed 
across multiple advanced malignancies.  Currently, the prevailing CIT approach is to 
circumvent immune evasion mechanisms and reinvigorate anti -tumor responses by 
[CONTACT_294846] T -cell co- inhibitory surface receptor s such as cytotoxic 
T-lymphocyte -associated protein 4 ( CTLA-4)and PD -L1/PD -1.  While these targets have 
resulted in remarkable clinical therapeutic success for various cancer indications, 
ongoing research indicates a series of stepwise events ne cessary fo r the generation of 
acontinuous anti -tumor immune response (Chen and Mellman 2013).  Each event is 
critical for an effective response, and each is also susceptible to several tumor immune 
evasion mechanisms.  Thus, the need to identify and circumvent the various factors 
involved in tumor immune evasion will be critical for propagating the anti -tumor immune 
response and advancing the field of CIT, most likely through combined targeted therapy 
regimens.
Recently, nonclinical and clinical data have indicated a correlation between PTEN loss 
and impaired anti -tumor immune responses, including reduced CD8 T -cell infiltration and 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
41/Protocol CO40151, Version 6reduced efficacy of anti -PD1 therapy in patients with melanoma .  Furthermore, 
nonclinical studies reveal synergistic anti -tumo r responses when combining PI3K -Akt
pathway inhibition and PD -L1/PD -1 axis blockade (Peng et al. 2016).  In addition, Akt 
inhibitors may restore and enhance physiological functionalities of T cells in the tumor 
microenvironment and enhance expansion of tumor -specific lymphocytes with memory 
cell phenotype (Crompton et al. 2015).  Concurrent treatment with ipatasertib may 
enhance checkpoint inhibitor efficacy by [CONTACT_294834] T -cells over 
effector T -cells, thereby [CONTACT_294835] a long -term respons e in patients (Gubser et al. 2013; 
Xue et al. 2015).  On the basis of these results as well as the tolerable safety profiles of 
atezolizumab and ipatasertib, combination treatment with these two agents appears to 
have promising therapeutic potential in sol id tumors such as TNBC.  
This Phase Ib study is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ipatasertib 
in combination wi th atez olizumab and chemotherapy . 
The clinical safety profile of ipatasertib as a single agent in the Phase Ia 
study (PAM4743g), in combination with paclitaxel in the Phase Ib (PAM4983g) and 
Phase II (GO29227) studies, supports continued development of ipatasertib in MBC .  As 
a single agent, ipatasertib has reasonable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile with a half -life of 
appro ximately 48 hours and significantly down -regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway at doses 
200mg.  In Study GO29227, the adverse effects of ipatasertib plus paclitaxel in 
metastatic TNBC were consistent with previous experiences of ipatasertib and of 
paclitaxel, most notably ipatasertib -related gastrointestinal toxicities that are manageable 
and reversible.  No new safety signals were identified. Common adverse events with 
a10% higher incidence in the ipatasertib arm than in the placebo arm were diarrhea, 
nausea, asthenia, and peripheral se nsory neuropathy.  Common Grade 3 adverse 
events witha 3% higher incidence in the ipatasertib arm than in the placebo arm 
included diarrhea, neutropenia, and fatigue.  W hen groupi[INVESTIGATOR_571768] w ith similar medical concepts, asthenia/fatigue and peripheral neuropathy were 
not significantly different between the two arms . Please refer to the Ipatasertib 
Investigator’s Brochure for detailed safety information.
In Study GO29227, diarrhea was more co mmon in the ipatasertib arm compared with 
the placebo arm (93% vs. 19%); however, the majority of cases were low grade.  The 
onset of diarrhea was most common within the first cycle and frequency of patients with 
new onset of diarrhea decreased with increased treatment duration ; and ,no cases of 
colitis were reported.  Diarrhea generally responded to loperamide treatment, ipatasertib 
dose holds and dose reductions when resuming treatment; limited (only 3%) 
discontinuation of ipatasertib treatment due to dia rrhea was reported. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_571769], the median relative dose intensity of both 
ipatasertib and paclitaxel approached 100% and was comparable in the ipatasertib and 
placebo arms.
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
42/Protocol CO40151, Version 6In this current study, to impr ove diarrhea management and patient experiences, 
anti-diarrhea prophylaxis (loperamide) will be mandated for the first cycle for all patients 
and implemented subsequently as clinically indicated.  Patients will be provided with 
educational materials and monitored for early signs of diarrhea symptoms, and 
investigators areprovided with comprehensive management guidelines (Section [IP_ADDRESS]
and Table 6 ) for study treatment related symptoms or potential risks.
The adverse events observed with atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy 
and/or targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33925].  
The most commonly reported adverse events with single -agent atezolizumab include 
fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhea, constipation, and coug h.  
Immune -mediated adverse events are consistent with the role of the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_750747] in regulating peripheral tolerance.  Given the mechanism of action of 
atezolizumab, events associated with inflammation and/or immune -mediated adverse 
events will be closely monitored in this study .  Immune- mediated adverse events 
associated with atezolizumab include hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis, 
diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, Guillain-Barré 
syndrome, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, hypophysitis, myocarditis ,and 
meningoencephalitis.  Guidance regarding the management of immune -mediated
adverse events is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix 13of the protocol .
Adverse events of special interest, in addition to overall safety, will be monitored as 
outlined in this protocol.

3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY
This is a Phase Ib, open -label, multicenter study consisting of four cohorts.  In Cohort 1, 
the safety and efficacy of ipatasertib atezolizumab paclitaxel (Ipat Atezo Pac) and 
ipatasertib atezolizumab nab-paclitaxel (Ipat Atezo Nab-Pac) will be evaluated in
patients with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have not previously received 
chemotherapy in the advanced setting.   In Cohort 2 (biopsy cohort), IpatAtezo
(with nochemotherapy) will be administered in the second -line and third -line setting to 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC for the main purpose of conducting 
exploratory biomarker assessments.  In Cohort 3, the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant 
ipatasertib atezolizumab doxorubi cincyclophosphamide ( IpatAtezo AC) followed 
by [CONTACT_571796] Atezo Pacwillbe evaluated in patients with locally advanced T24 TNBC.
InCohort 4, the safety and efficacy of IpatAtezo Pacwill be evaluated in patients with 
PD-L1positive locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have not previously received 
chemotherapy in the advanced setting.
There is aknown andacceptable safety profile of ipatasertib with paclitaxel and 
atezolizumab with paclitaxel or nab- paclitaxel (Sections 1.2and1.3).If an unexpected 
safety signal is detected at any time, doublet safety of ipatasertib with atezolizumab may 
be further evaluated.  The safety and efficacy of the combination of ipatasertib with 
atezolizumab is being assessed both in Cohort 2 of this trial and separately (i.e. ,in 
Study CO39611 for HR -positive/ HER2 -negative MBC and Study CO40115 for TNBC ).
Up to 25 sites in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific will enroll approximately 
202patients (114 patients in Cohort 1 , 14 patients in Cohort 2 ,24 patients in Cohort 3, 
and 50 patients in Cohort 4 ).
3.1.1 Overview  of Study  Design
Two triplets (Arm A and Arm B) are being evaluated as first -line treatment for patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC in Cohort 1 (see Figure 1).  Both arms have 
asafety run- in cohort of 6 patients (Stage 1 within each arm [A1 and B1] ) who will be 
evaluated for safety and tolerability before the ex pansion stage of 14 patients (Stage 2 
within each arm [A2 and B2] ). Two additional arms (Arms C and D) will explore 
staggered dosing schedules of the triplet combination to obtain additional safety and 
tolerability data (see Figure 1).Both of these additional arms have a safety run -in cohort 
of 6 patients (Stage 1 within each arm [C1 and D1] ) who will be evaluated for safety and 
tolerability of the staggered dosing schedule before the expansion stage of 6 patients
(Stage 2 within each arm [C2 and D2] ). 
Based on a confirmed ORR of 70% being reached in the first 26 patients enrolled,
Arm A in Cohort 1 will be extended to include up to approximately 50 additional patients 
(Arm A3) inthe expansion phase (Stage 3 for Arm A [A3]) to further investigate the 
tolerability and efficacy of the triplet combination in first-line locally advanced or 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
48/Protocol CO40151, Version 6metastatic TNBC. Arm A3 will open after Arms C2 and D2 have been filled.   If 
adifferential efficacy signal is detected, the Sponsor may elect to restrict enrollment to 
patients with a particular tumor biomarker status.
Abiopsy cohort (Cohort 2) evaluating biomarker assessments of the doublet of 
ipatasertib plus atezolizumab (Arm E) in [ADDRESS_750750] -line 
setting was opened for enrollment after preliminary encouraging efficacy and acceptable 
tolerability from C ohort 1 (see Figure 1).
Alocally advanced T24 TNBC cohort (Cohort 3) of approximately 24 patients was 
added to enable evaluation of neoadjuvant IpatAtezo AC for twocycles followed by 
[CONTACT_571796]Atezo Pac for three cycles (duration of each cycle, 28 days).  In Arm F, the 
ipatasertib dose will be [ADDRESS_750751] a safety run- in cohort of 6 patients (Stage 1 within each arm [F1 and G1]) who will 
be evaluated for safety and tolerability before the expansion stage (Stage 2), in which 
atotal of 12 patients may be enrolled, with the Sponso r determining allocation to 
Arm F2, Arm G2, or both (see Figure 1).  Patients should u ndergo breast surgery 
between 2 and 6 weeks after the final dose of neoadjuvant treatment.  Efficacy will be 
evaluated in relation to tumor biomarker status (e.g., PD -L1 expression or alteration in 
PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN).
Because of lower prevalence ofPD-L1positive tumors relative to PD-L1negative 
tumors and the availability of data in patients with PD -L1positive tumors 
(Study WO29522 [IMpassion130]) , Cohort 4 will furt her evaluate the triplet combination 
of IpatAtezo Pac as first -line treatment in approximately 50additional patients with 
PD-L1positive tumors ( see Figure 1).  
Patients in Cohorts 1, 2, and 4 will continue to be treated until unacceptable toxicity or 
loss of clinical benefit as determined by [CONTACT_408056], local biopsy results (if available), and clinical 
status (e.g., symptomatic deterioration such as pain secondary to disease).  Because of 
the possibility of an initial increase in tumor burden caused by [CONTACT_44859] -cell infilt ration in 
the setting of a T -cell response (termed pseudoprogression) with atezolizumab 
treatment, radiographic progression per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_750752] v1.1 while receiving atezolizumab will be permitted 
to continue atezolizumab if they meet allof the following criteria:
Evidence of clinical benefit , as determined by [CONTACT_169830] a review of 
all availa ble data
Absence of symptoms and signs (including laboratory values, such as new or 
worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
49/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Absence of decline in ECOG Performance Status (see Appendix 7)that can be 
attributed to disease progression
Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal 
disease) that cannot be managed by [CONTACT_990] -allowed medical inter ventions
Patients in Cohort 3 will continue to be treated for fivecycles (28-day cycles; 20weeks) 
or until disease progression orunacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.

3.1.2 Safety  Run -In Stage with Safety  Assessment Window (Cohort 
1: Arms A 1 and B1)
Up to 6 patients were enrolled in Arm A to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
ipatasertib in combination with atezolizumab and paclitaxel in an initial 28- day (1cycle) 
period (Cohort 1 ,hereafter referred to as A1; see Figure 1in Section 3.1.1 ). Ipatasertib 
400mg wasadministered orally once a day (QD) on D ays 1 21,and atezolizumab was
administered by [CONTACT_22671] a fixed dose of 840 mg on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day
cycle . Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2wasadministered by [CONTACT_197275] 1,8, and15 of 
each [ADDRESS_750753] dose of ipat asertib for 28 days. Patients who withdraw from the stud y 
prior to completing the safety assessment for any reason other than a treatment -related 
adverse event will be r eplaced.  In addition, patients who miss more than 7 total days of 
dosing of ipatasertib during the safety assessment window for reasons other than 
atreatment -related toxicity will be replaced.  Patients will not be allowed to make up 
missed doses of study drugs (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] on study treatment administration) ; 
patients will resume dosing at their next scheduled dose.  All patients who do not receive
three doses of chemotherapy or two doses of atezolizumab during the safety
assessment window for any reason other th an a treatment -related toxicity will be 
replaced. The totality of safety information from patients in A1 were assessed by [CONTACT_571809].
After enrollment was completed for Arm A Cohort 1 (i.e., A1), up to 6 patients were
enrolled into Arm B to evaluate safety of ipatasertib in combination with atezolizumab Cycles 1 and 2

Beyond the safety assessment period, patients will continue to be treated until loss of 
clinical benefit , unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent ,or end of the study .The
pharmacokinetics of ipatasertib and its metabolite G -037720, and atezolizumab will be 
assessed i n all patients receiving the study drugs. Any patient who does not receive any 
study treatment will be replaced.
3.1.3 Expansion Stage (Cohort 1: Arms A 2, B2,and A 3)
The Sponsor opened enrollment into the expansion arms with input from all participating 
investigators, after an integrated assessment of safety data from Arms A1 and B1 had 
been reviewed. Up to 14 patients were enrolled into the expansion stage of each 
corresponding arm (hereafter referred to as A2 or B2, co rrespondingly).
Based on a confirmed overall response rate of 70% being reached in the first 
26patients enrolled, Arm A will be further extended (after completion of Arms A1, B1, 
A2, B2, C1, D1, C2 ,and D2 enrollment) to include up to approximately 50 additional 
patients (Arm A3) into the expansion phase (Stage 3 of Arm A) to further investigate the 
tolerability and efficacy of the triplet combination in first-line metastatic TNBC.
Up to approximately 114 patients would be enrolled in Cohort 1 (i.e.,ipatasertib-
atezolizumab- taxane arms )of the study.  Patients’ PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumor 
status would be evaluated on an ongoing basis .  Based on the observed prevalence, 
enrollment may be restricted to patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors .
3.1.4 Safety  Run -In Stage with Safety  Assessment Window 
(Cohort 1:  A rms C1 and D1)
To further explore tolerability of the triplet combination , an additional two arms (Arms C 
and D) evaluating staggered dosing ha vebeen added to the study to obtain additional 
safety and tolerability data.  Enrolment into these arms will supersede enrollment into 
Arm B2. 
Up to 6 patients will be enrolled in a safety run -in cohort of Arm C to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of a 2-week lead- in with ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel, 
followed by [CONTACT_571811] ,in an initial 28- day (1 cycle) period (hereafter 
referred to as Arm C1; see Figure 1in Section 3.1.1 ).  Ipatasertib 400 mg will be 
administered orally QD on Days 121, with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2administered by [CONTACT_571801] 1, 8, and 15. Atezolizumab [ADDRESS_750754] cycle (see Figure 2).  In all subsequent treatment cycles 
(Cycles 2), ipatasertib 400 mg will be administered orally QD on Days 1 21, paclitaxel 
80mg/m2will be admi nistered by [CONTACT_197275] 1,8, and 15, and atezolizumab will 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
55/Protocol CO40151, Version 6be administered by [CONTACT_22671] a fixed dose of 840 mg on Days 1 and 15 of each 
28-day cycle (see Figure 2).  Tolerability will be assessed within the initial 28 days of the 
triplet regimen (safety assessment window).  Patients who withdraw from the study prior 
to completing the safety assessment for any reason other than a treatment -related 
adverse event will be replaced.  In addition, patients who miss more than 7 total days of 
dosing of ipatasertib during the safety assessment window for reasons other than a 
treatment -related toxicity will be replaced.  Patients will not be allowed to make up 
missed doses of study drugs (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] on study treatment administration); 
patients will resume dosing at their next scheduled dose.  All patients who do not receive 
three doses of chemotherapy or one dose of atezolizumab during t he safety assessment 
window for any reason other than a treatment -related toxicity will be replaced.  The 
totality of safety information from patients in Arm C1 will be shared with all participating 
investigator.
After enrollment is completed for Arm C1, u p to 6 patients will be enrolled into a safety 
run-in cohort of Arm D to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a 2 -week lead -in with 
atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel, followed by [CONTACT_571812] 28- day (1 cycle) period (hereafter referred to as Arm D1).  Atezolizumab 840 mg 
will be administered by [CONTACT_197275] 1 and 15, with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2
administered by [CONTACT_197275] 1, 8, and 15.  Ipatasertib 400 mg will be 
administered orally QD on Days 15 [ADDRESS_750755] cycle (see Figure 2).  In all 
subsequent treatment cycles ( Cycles 2), ipatasertib 400 mg will be administered orally 
QD on Days 1 21, paclitaxel 80 mg/m2will be administered by [CONTACT_197275] 1, 8, 
and 15, and atezolizumab will be administered by [CONTACT_22671] a fixed dose of 840 mg 
on Days 1 and 15 of each 28 -day cycle (see Figure 2). Tolerability will be assessed 
within the initial 28 days of the triple regimen (safety assessment window), similar to 
Arm C1. 
Beyond the safety assessment period, patients will continue to be tre ated until loss of 
clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or end of the study.  The 
pharmacokinetics of ipatasertib and its metabolite G -037720, and atezolizumab will be 
assessed in all patients receiving the study drugs.  Any pati ent who does not receive any 
study treatment will be replaced.
3.1.5 Expansion Stage (Cohort 1:  A rms C2 and D2)
After either Arms C1 or D1 is assessed and the safety is found to be acceptable, up to 
6patients may be enrolled into the expansion stage of each corresponding arm 
(hereafter referred to as C2 or D2, correspondingly).  Initiation of Arm D2 enrollment will
follow completion of Arm C2 enrollment when applicable.  Patients’ 
PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumor status will be evaluated on an ongoing basis.  Based 
on the observed prevalence, enrollment may be restricted to patients with 
PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumor s.

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
56/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Arms C1 , C2, D1 , and D 2 may not need to be opened or be fully accrued if safety 
management and toxicity profile is deemed jointly by [CONTACT_571813].
3.1.6 Biopsy  Cohort (Cohort 2 )
Since the combinatio n of ipatasertib and atezolizumab with taxane in Cohort 1 
demonstrated meaningful clinical activity (i.e., ORR at least 50%), the Sponsor opened 
enrollment of a separate mandatory on -treatment biopsy cohort (to be ca lled Cohort 2) to 
evaluate biomarker end points in patients treated with ipatasertib combined with 
atezolizumab to further understand the molecular basis of treatment benefit. The 
opening of the biopsy cohort was enabled with input from all participating investigators, 
along with the Sponsor, af ter an integrated assessment of radiographic and biochemical 
data, local biopsy results (if available), safety data, and clinical status (e.g., symptomatic 
deterioration such as pain secondary to disease) from Cohort 1 (safety run -in and 
expansion stages) had been reviewe d.
Up to [ADDRESS_750756] be from the same lesion from which subsequent biopsies will be 
collected. In other words, if serial biopsy is not possible at the site where the archival 
biopsy is from, a ne w biopsy from another site appropriate for serial biopsies should be 
performed. Tumor locations more appropriate for serial biopsies (such as cutaneous 
lesions or superficial lymph node metastases) should be prioritized over visceral sites 
(such as lung o r liver metastasis).  Furthermore, the Sponsor will clarify that all tumor 
biopsies (i.e. ,initial and subsequent serial biopsies) should come from the same site to 
help isolate tumor response to treatment from inter -tumoral heterogeneity .
Patients in the biopsy expansion cohort will start treatment with ipatasertib alone on 
Day1 of Cycle [ADDRESS_750757] treatment cycle will be 35 days ,and all f ollowing 
treatment cycles will be 28 days in duration (see Figure 2). Ipatasertib 400 mg will be 
administered orally QD on Days 1 28 of Cycle 1 (35 -day cycle) and on Days 1 21 of 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
57/Protocol CO40151, Version 6subsequent cycles (28- day cycles).  Atezolizumab will be administered by [CONTACT_22671] 
a fixed dose of 840 mg on Days 8 and 22 of Cycle 1 and on Days 1 and 15 of 
subsequent cycles.  See Appendix 2and Appendix 5for a schedule of safety and PK 
assessments, respectively.
3.1.7 Safety  Run -In Stage with S afety  Assessment Window 
(Cohort 3: Arms F1 and G1)
Up to 6 patients will be enrolled in Arm F1 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
IpatAtezo AC (ipatasertib dose of 300 mg) followed by [CONTACT_571796] Atezo Pac (ipatasertib 
dose of 400 mg) before surgery (see Figure 1in Section 3.1.1 ).  Patients will be treated 
for fivecycles of [ADDRESS_750758] ered orally QD at a dose of 
300mg on Days 1 21 of Cycles 1 and 2 and at a dose of 400 mg on Days 121of 
Cycles 3 5.  Atezolizumab will be administered by [CONTACT_22671] a fixed dose of 840 mg 
on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1 5.  Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2and cyclophosphamide 
600mg/m2will be admini stered by [CONTACT_16228] (with filgrastim or pegfilgrastim support) on 
Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1 and 2.  Paclitaxel 80mg/m2will be administered by 
[CONTACT_571814] 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 3 5(see Figure 2).  Tolerability will be 
assessed when at least [ADDRESS_750759] 4 weeks of study treatment 
(safety assessment window).  Patients who receive non -protocol therapy prior to surgery 
will be discontinued from study treatment.  Patients who discontinue all study treatment 
prior to completing the safety assessment window for any reason other than 
treatment -related toxicity will be replaced.   Patients who miss more than [ADDRESS_750760] two doses of atezolizumab during the 
treatment period for any reason other than treatment -related toxicity will be replaced.  
Patients will not be allowed to make up missed doses of ipatsertib and atezolizumab
study drugs; patients will resume dosing at their next scheduled dose (refer to 
Secti on4.3.2.1 for details on study treatment administration) .  If clinically possible, 
patients should receive [ADDRESS_750761] to Arm G1.
If the treatment regimen for Arm F1 is found to be acceptable, up to 6 patients will be 
enrolled in Arm G1 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IpatAtezo AC (ipatasertib 
dose of 400 mg) followed by [CONTACT_571796] Atezo Pac (ipatasertib dose of 400 mg) before 
surgery (see Figure 1in Section 3.1.1 ).  Patients wil l be treated for fivecycles of 28 days 
each.  Ipatasertib 400 mg will be administered orally QD on Days 1 21 of Cycles 15.  
Atezolizumab will be administered by [CONTACT_22671] a fixed dose of 840 mg on Days 1 
and 15 of Cycles 15.  Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2will be 
administered by [CONTACT_16228] (with filgrastim or pegfi lgrastim support) on Days 1 and 15 of 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
58/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Cycles 1and2(see Figure 2).  Paclitaxel 80mg/m2will be administered by [CONTACT_571810] 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 35.  Tolerability for Arm G1 will be assessed in the 
same manner as for Arm F1. 
3.1.8 Expansion Stage (Cohort 3:  A rms F2 and G2)
If the treatment regimens for Arms F1 andG1 are found to be acceptable, atotal of up to 
12patients may be en rolled during the expansion stage , with th e Sponsor determining 
allocation to Arm F2, Arm G2, or both .
3.1.9 PD-L1Positive Cohort (Cohort 4 :  Arm H )
Approximately 50 patients with PD -L1positive tu mors will be enrolled in Cohort 4 to 
further investigate the tolerability and efficacy of the IpatAtezo Pacasfirst-line 
treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC.   Ipatasertib 400 mg will 
be administered orally QD on Days 1 21, atezolizumab will be administered by [CONTACT_269880] a fixed dose of 840 mg on D ays 1 and 15, and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2will be 
administered by [CONTACT_197275] 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle.  
3.1.10 Assessments and Monitoring
All patients will be closely monitored for adverse events throughout the study, and 
adverse events will be graded according to the Nation al Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0).   Laboratory 
safety assessments will include the regular monitoring of hematology and blood 
chemistry.
Blood samples will be taken at various timepoints before and during study treatment 
administration to enable PK and immunogenicity analyses .  On the basis of a review of 
real-time safety data and available PK data, treatment regimens may be modified by [CONTACT_571815].   The schedule of activities for PK samples is presented 
in Appendix 4, Appendix 5, and Appendix 6.
Patients in Cohorts 1 , 2,and 4will un dergo tumor assessments every 8 weeks (from 
Day 1 of Cycle 1).  Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_26309] v1.1 
(see Appendix 10).
Patients in Cohort 3 wil l undergo radiographic and other disease assessments as 
outlined in Section 4.5.6 .  Evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint, pCR rate 
(ypT0/Tis ypN0) ,will be based on local review following completion of neoadjuvant 
therapy and surgery.  Details on disease staging are provided in Section 4.5.6 .
Baseline tumor tissue samples will be collected from all patients, preferably by [CONTACT_3553] 
a biopsy performed at study entry.  If a biopsy is not deemed feasible by [CONTACT_093], 
archival tumor tissue may be submitted, provided that the tissue was obtained from 
abiopsy performed within 6 months prior to enrollment and that the patient has not 
received any anti -cancer therapy since the time of the biopsy.   Ifdeemed clinically 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
59/Protocol CO40151, Version 6feasible by [CONTACT_093], tumor tissue will also be collected for patients who 
discontinue because of unacceptable toxicity, disea se progression per RECIST v1.1, or 
loss of clinical benefit as determined by [CONTACT_093] .  For patients enrolled in 
Cohort 2 (i.e. ,mandatory on- treatment biopsy cohort), twoadditional tumor tissue 
sample swill be collected during treatment (if clinically f easible).  These samples, as well 
as blood samples collected during the study, will be utilized for biomarker research (see 
rationale for biomarker assessments in Section 3.3.10 and details on tissue sample 
collection in Section 4.5.7 ).
3.1.[ADDRESS_750762], will monitor 
patient safety throughout the study .  In addition to the ongoing assessmen t of the 
incidence, nature and severity of adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths, and 
laboratory abnormalities performed by [CONTACT_571816], the 
Study Team will review all necessary cumulative data at regular intervals (i.e.,
approximately three times a year) during the study.  Assessment of safety for the 
safety-run-in cohorts (i.e. ,Arms A1 ,B1, C1, D1 , F1,and G1 ) will be performed by [CONTACT_571817].

3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN
3.3.1 Rationale for Patient Population
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_571770], TNBC remains a challenging disease.  Although 
chemotherapy is a mainstay treatment for TNBC , resistance inevitably develops and 
benefit is often short lived.  Ipatasertib with paclitaxel has shown encouraging clinical 
benefit for advanced TNBC inthe randomized Phase II study ( GO29 227 or LOTUS).  
Inaddition , CIThas shown promising preliminary clinical data in the treatment of TNBC
(Nanda et al. 2016; Schmid et al. 2017) ,and it has changed the standard of care for 
other cancers.
Taxanes, particularly paclitaxel or docetaxel, are increasingly used for adjuvant 
treatment of HER2- negative breast cancers worldwide.  Many patients are expected to 
have received adjuvant chemotherapy, including taxanes, which causes concern about 
re-challenge with taxane treatment at recurrence when pati ents first relapse in the 
advanced setting.  Although there has been no specific prospective trial to evaluate the 
efficacy of re-challenge with paclitaxel in the metastatic setting after prior adjuvant 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
60/Protocol CO40151, Version 6taxane exposure, guidelines support the re -use of a t axane in the metastatic setting, 
particularly if there has been at least 1 year of disease -free survival since its use in the 
adjuvant setting (Cardoso et al. 2017).  In this study, for Cohort s 1, 2, and 4, patients 
must have a minimum 12-month window betw eencomplet ion of any 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy treatment (including taxane) and initiation of study 
treatment , thus selecting for patients who are likely to retain sensitivity to taxane 
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.  
Recently, the TNT study demonstrated superiority of carboplatin over docetaxel for the 
treatment of patients with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA ) 
mutation- positive breast cancer (Tutt et al. 2015).  Thus, in patients with 
BRCA -associated TNBC or endocri ne-resistant M BC, a platinum regimen may be 
apreferred option, if not previously administered (Cardoso et al. 2017).  The efficacy of 
ipatasertib or atezolizumab for patients with homologous recombination repair deficiency 
(e.g., patients with BRCA1/2 germline mutation positive disease) is unknown.
Cohort 1 evaluates the benef it/risk of ipatasertib with atezolizumab and a taxane in 
locally advanced or metastatic TNBC with no previous systemic tr eatment in the 
advanced setting . 
Cohort 3 evaluate sthe combination of ipatasertib ,atezolizumab ,AC,and paclitaxel as 
neoadjuvant treatment in patients with locally advanced T24 TNBC. This cohort will 
enroll patients with T24 TNBC (see Section 4.1.1 ) because increased primary tumor 
size has been identified as a poor prognostic variable and has been associated with 
decreased disease -free survival and increased likelihood of early metastat ic disease in 
patients with TNBC (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_571771]. 2013; Rosa Mendoza et al. 2013).
Cohort 4 evaluates the benefit versus risk of ipatasertib, atezolizumab ,and paclitaxel in

3.3.2 Rationale for Ipatasertib in Combination with A tezolizumab and 
Paclitaxel or Nab -Paclitaxel
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Targeting the PI3K/A kt Pathway
Large -scale comprehensive genomic analyses (Cancer Genome Atlas N etwork 2012 ;
Lehmann and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_294759] 2014 ;Pereira et al. 2016) have characterized the 
heterogeneous nature of breast cancer and its diverse gene -expression patterns and 
underlying genomic changes.  In breast cancer, Akt is an important node along the 
PI3K/A kt pathway that controls apoptosis and cell growth (Yap et al. 2008), and this 
pathway is known to be highly activated in breast cancers (Cancer Genome Atlas 
Network 2012). 
Up-regulation of Akt signaling (whether intrinsic or induced following chemotherapy) 
represents a potentially important survival pathway in response to genotoxic or mitotic 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
61/Protocol CO40151, Version 6stress (Xu et al. 2012).  Data from nonclinical models of ipatasertib plus microtubule
inhibitors or DNA -damaging chemotherapy agents showed a clear advantage of the 
combination over respective single -agent treatment (refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator’s 
Brochure for further information).  
Based on the scientific rationale that PI3K/Akt blockade attenuates survival signals 
associated with mitotic stress from treatment with microtubule inhibitors and the high 
prevalence of PI3K/Akt pathway activation signatures in breast cancers (Cancer 
Genome Atlas Network 2012), clinical trials evaluati ng the preliminary safety and 
efficacy of the combination of ipatasertib and paclitaxel in patients with breast cancer 
have been conducted. 
In the randomized, placebo- controlled Phase II study (GO29227) in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic TNBC , ipatasertib 400mgwas administered QD on Days 121
of each 28- day cycle ,and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2was administered weekly on Days 1,8, 
and15 of each 28- day cycle.  Patients in the ipatasertib paclitaxel arm showed a more 
pronounced improvement in PFS in the pre-specified patient population with 
PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors (hazard ratio 0.44, 9.0 months with 
ipatasertib paclitaxel vs. 4.9 months with paclitaxel alone ) compared with patients with 
PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN non-altered tumors (hazard ra tio0.76, 5.3 months with 
ipatasertib paclitaxel vs. 3.7 months with paclitaxel alone ) or unselected ITT patients 
(hazard ratio 0.60, 6.2 months with ipatasertib paclitaxel vs. 4.9 months with paclitaxel 
alone ).  The combination of ipatasertib and paclitaxel has been generally well tolerated.  
The most common adverse events in the ipatasertib paclitaxel arm (incidence of 10% 
higher than in the placebo paclitaxel arm) were diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, and 
peripheral sensory neuropathy.  When groupi[INVESTIGATOR_571772], asthenia/fatigue and peripheral 
neuropathy were not significantly d ifferent between the two arms. 
Overall, efficacy results from Study GO29227 support the hypothesis that inhibition of 
Akt signaling may improve the effectiveness of taxane treatment and that patients with 
PI3K/Akt -activated tumors are more sensitive to ip atasertib .

studies.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Immunotherapy  in Breast Cancer
CIT has demonstrated extraordinary success, with significant survival benefits observed 
across multi ple advanced malignancies.  Currently, the prevailing CIT approach is to 
circumvent immune evasion mechanisms and reinvigorate anti -tumor responses by 
[CONTACT_294846] T -cell co- inhibitory surface receptors such as CTLA -4 and 
PD-L1/PD -1.  While th ese targets have resulted in remarkable clinical therapeutic 
success for various cancer indications, ongoing research indicates a series of stepwise 
events necessary for the generation of a continuous anti -tumor immune response 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
62/Protocol CO40151, Version 6(Chen and Mellman 2013 ).  Ea ch event is critical for an effective response, and each is 
also susceptible to several tumor immune evasion mechanisms.  Thus, the need to 
identify and circumvent the various factors involved in tumor immune evasion will be 
critical for propagating the anti -tumor immune response and advancing the field of CIT, 
most likely through combined targeted therapy regimens.
Encouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunotherapy have 
demonstrated that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33385] T -cell responses a gainst cancer can 
result in a significant survival benefit in patients with advanced malignancies 
(Hodi etal.2010; Kantoff et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2012).
The PD -L1 pathway serves as an immune checkpoint to temporarily dampen immune 
responses in states o f chronic antigen stimulation, such as chronic infection or cancer.  
PD-L1 is an extracellular protein that down -regulates immune responses through binding 
to its two receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1.  PD -1 is an inh ibitory receptor expressed on T cells 
following T-cell activation, and expression is sustained in states of chronic stimulation 
(Blank etal.2005; Keir et al. 2008).  B7- 1 is a molecule expressed on 
antigen -presenting cells and activated T cells.  Binding of PD -L1 to PD -1 and B7 -1 
inhibits T -cell proli feration and activation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity, 
leading to the functional inactivation or exhaustion of T cells (Butte et al. 2007; 
Yang etal.2011).  Overexpression of PD -L1 on tumor cells has been reported to impede 
anti-tumor immunity, resulting in immune evasion (Blank and Mackensen 2007).  
Therefore, interruption of the PD -L1 pathway represents an attractive strategy for 
restoring tumor -specific T -cell immunity.
Targeting the PD -L1 pathway with atezolizumab has demonstrated activ ity in patients 
with advanced malignancies who have failed standard- of-care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Objective 
responses have been observed across a broad range of malignancies, including 
NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, colorectal cancer, h ead 
and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma.  The combination of 
atezolizumab and nab- paclitaxel has shown encouraging efficacy (Adams et al. 201 6)
(see Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for detailed efficacy results).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Combining Ipatasertib with A tezolizumab
Recently, the loss of PTEN, a direct an tagonist of Akt, has emerged as a potential 
mechanism for resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy ,and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt 
pathway has shown reversal of T cell-mediated immunotherapy resistance (Peng et al. 
2016 ;George et al. 2017 ).  Potential impacts of Akt inhibition on immune response 
include the following : 1) improving recognition of cancer cells by [CONTACT_571818] ( Xue et al. 2015); 2) restoring and 
enhancing physiological functionalities of T cells in the tumor microenvironment, in 
addition to enhancing expansion of tumor -specific lymphocytes with memory cell 
phenotype (Crompton et al. 2015); and 3) promoting the gen eration of superior, 
stem -liketumor -reactive T cells for adoptive immunotherapy (van der W aart et al. 2014).
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
63/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Due to encouraging data for TNBC seen in both combination sof ipatasertib with 
paclitaxel and atezolizumab with nab- paclitaxel, this study tests the hypothesis of 
improved efficacy with the combination of ipatasertib with atezolizumab and paclitaxel or 
nab-paclitaxel.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_750764] p roven beneficial as neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
therapy for EBC, improving both disease -specific and OS outcomes (Berry et al. 2006; 
NCCN 2016).  The most effective combination regimens include anthracyclines, 
topoisomerase II inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, and taxanes ( Early Breast Cancer 
Trialists’ Collaborative Group 2005; Peto et al. 2012 ).  In the neoadjuvant setting, 
anthracycline -and taxane -based regimens have routinely been used in patients with 
TNBC, resulting in reported pCR rates of 41% 48% (Sparano et al. 2008; Sikov et al. 
2015; Untch et al. 2016).  Three -year EFS rates of 74% 76% have been reported for 
patients with TNBC who have received neoadjuvant anthracycline -and 
taxane -containing therapy (von Minckwitz et al. 2014; Sikov et al. 2015), leaving room 
for improvement in outcomes. 
A commonly used regimen for TNBC is weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks followed by [CONTACT_571819] 2 3 weeks for fourcycles (14-day cycles) . A recent meta -analysis by [CONTACT_571820] 10,004 women demonstrated that patients who received 
chemotherapy every 2 weeks were 17% and 15% less likely to have disease recurrence 
and die from breast cancer within 10 years, respectively, compared with those who 
received treatment every 3 weeks. The 15% risk reduction was similar in ER -positive 
and ER -negative disease, and did not differ significant ly with respect to any other patient 
or tumo r characteristics, including age, HER2 status, nodal status, tumo r size, and tumor 
grade (Gray et a l.SABCS 2017). The chemotherapy regimen included in this study is 
built upon the aforementi oned regimen .
Treatment with CIT has demonstrated significant survival benefits across multiple 
advanced malignancies. Currently, the prevailing CIT approach is to circumvent immune 
evasion mechanisms and reinvigorate anti- tumor responses by [CONTACT_294846] 
T-cell co- inhibitory surface receptors such as PD -L1 or PD-1. Emerging clinical trial data 
have shown that the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy 
enhances efficacy as determined by [CONTACT_508880].  In TNBC, early results from combi nation trials 
of antiPD-1/PD -L1 checkpoint inhibitors and anthracycline -and taxane -based 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy have demonstrated high pCR rates of around 60% 
(Nanda et al. 2014; Schmid et al. 2017) .Phase IIIstudies are underway to confirm 
these results. 
As stated in Section 1.3, the safety of atezolizumab in combination with 
chemotherapeutic regimens, including anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide, is 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
64/Protocol CO40151, Version 6currently being investigated in various indications in Studies GP28328, BO29563, and 
GO29831.  Thus far, reported adverse events for combination regimens have been 
similar to those experienc ed with each individual agent and have generally been 
manageable.
While PD-1/PD -L1targeting agents have resulted in remarkable clinical therapeutic 
success for various cancer indications, ongoing research indicates that a series of 
stepwise events is necessary for the generation of a continuous anti -tumor immune 
response (Chen and Mellman 2013). Each event is critical for an effective response, 
and each is also susceptible to several tumor immune -evasion mechanisms. Thus, the 
need to identify and circumv ent the various factors involved in tumor immune evasion 
will be critical for propagating the anti -tumor immune response and advancing the field of 
CIT, most likely through combined targeted therapy regimens. 
Recently, nonclinical and clinical data have indicated a correlation between PTEN loss 
(which is common in TNBC) and impaired anti -tumor immune responses, including 
reduced CD8 T- cell infiltration and reduced efficacy of anti PD-[ADDRESS_750765] inhibition and PD-1/PD -L1axis blockade (Peng et al. 
2016) . In addition, Akt inhibitors may r estore and enhance physiologic functionalities of 
T cells in the tumor microenvironment and enhance expansion of tumor -specific 
lymphocytes with memory -cell phenotype (Crompton et al. 2015) . Concurrent treatment 
with ipatasertib may enhance checkpoint inhibitor efficacy by [CONTACT_571821] T cells over effector T cells, thereby [CONTACT_294835] a long -term response in patients 
(Gubser et al. 2013; Xue et al. 2015) . 
Results of the randomized LOTUS study (GO29227) demonstrate that adding ipatasertib 
to paclitaxel as first -line therapy for metastatic TNBC improves PFS in the ITT 
populatio n; the PFS improvement was more pronounced in patients with
PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumor s identified by [CONTACT_077] (representing approximately 40% 
of the randomized patients in this setting). On the basis of these results as well as the 
tolerable safety profil es of atezolizumab and ipatasertib, combination treatment with 
these two agents appears to have promising therapeutic potential in TNBC.
The value of ipatasertib and atezolizumab added to a standard neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy approach has not yet been determ ined,and the net impact on immune
response is unknown. However, t he current experience with ipatasertib in combination 
with atezolizumab and taxanes in this study (Cohort 1) suggests that the study 
treatments can be given with an acceptable toxicity profile along with promising 
confirmed response rates . All patients enrolled in the Cohort 3 will be closely monitored 
for safety and tolerability.
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
65/Protocol CO40151, Version 63.3.4 Rationale for Starting Dose and Schedul e of Ipatasertib
For ipatasertib, the starting dose of 400 mg QD on Days 1 21 of each 28 -day cycle was 
selected on the basis of safety and PKdata from Arm C of Study PAM4983g ( Phase Ib 
trial of ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel; refer to the Ipataserti b Investigator's 
Brochure for details).  The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and ipatasertib following 
co-administration showed no evidence of drug drug interaction (See Section 3.3.12 ), 
and 400 mg ipatasertib was better tolerated than 600 mg ipatasertib in this combination. 
In the randomized, placebo -controlled Phase II study (GO29227) in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic TNBC, the combination of ipatasertib 400mg administered QD 
on Days 1 21 of each 28 -day cycle and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2administered weekly on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28- day cycle was generally well tolerated and showed an 
improvement in PFS (refer to Section 1.2andSection 1.3); the sparse sampling 
exposure results in this study were also consistent with the known PK profiles of 
ipatasertib (and its metabolite G-037720) .
Doxorubicin is not a substrate of CYP3A and is not reported to be a CYP3A4 inhibitor or 
inducer in vivo. As such, no drug drug interaction is expected between doxorubicin and 
ipatasertib. CYP3A4 does not play a major role in metabolism of cy clophosphamide ,
and cyclophosphamide is not reported to be a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer in vivo. As 
such, no drug drug interaction is expected between cy clophosphamide and ipatasertib.  
Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody ,is not metabolized by [CONTACT_097]450 enzymes ,and 
does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes in vivo. As such, no drug drug interaction 
is expected between atezolizumab and ipatasertib.
In addition, the totality of pharmacodynamics data from Phase I (PAM4743g, 
PK/pharmacodynamic analysis) and safety and effi cacy data from randomized Phase II 
studies of ipatasertib (Study GO29227 and Study GO27983, which evaluated two dose 
levels of 200 mg and 400 mg of ipatasertib in patients with metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer) and explorator y exposure- response analyses for both safety 
and efficacy endpoints (data on file) support the selected starting dose of [ADDRESS_750766] inhibition and efficacy with a generally acceptable 
safety profile (refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator's Brochure for details).  In the 
ipatasertib paclitaxel arm of the GO29227 study, despi[INVESTIGATOR_571773] 21.3% of patients due to adverse events, discontinuation of 
ipatasertib /placebo due to any adverse event occurred in 4 patients ( 6.6%) i n the 
ipatasertib arm compared with1patient (1.6%) in the control arm.  The median 
cumulative dose intensity of both ipatasertib and paclitaxel in the ipatasertib arm was 
maintained at 99.0% (ipatasertib) and 100% (paclitaxel). Discontinuation of paclitaxel 
dueto any adverse event was 6.6% in the ipatasertib arm and 8.1% i n the control arm. 
A relative bioavailability and food -effect study (GO29868) was conducted in healt hy 
subjects .  This study confirmed that the Phase III tablet formulation of ipatasertib to be 
used in this study willprovide exposures similar to the exposures observed following 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
66/Protocol CO40151, Version 6administration of powder -in-capsule formulation and Phase II tablet formulat ion of 
ipatasertib used in the Phase I (PAM4743g, PAM4983g) and Phase II (GO29227) 
studies, respectively.
3.3.[ADDRESS_750767] including anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], and pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin), taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel, and albumin -bound paclitaxel ), 
anti-metabolites (capecitabine and gemcitabine), platinums (cisplatin and carboplatin), 
and non- taxane microtubule inhibitors (eribulin and vinorelbine).  Generally, combination 
chemotherapy is associated with higher ORRs than single -agent chemotherapy;
however, because of an increase in toxicity and little survival benefit, sequential use of 
single agents is usually preferred (Cardoso et al. 2017 ;NCCN 2017).
Currently, there is no defined standard regimen for paclitaxel in the metastatic setting, as 
paclitaxel can be administered weekly (80 90 mg/m2) or Q3W(175 mg/m2) 
(Swanton 2006 ;Cardoso et al. 2017 ;NCCN 2017 ).  Meta -analysis showed no difference 
in PFS ([ADDRESS_750768] ratio 1.02, 95% CI :1.081.32), while OS was 
statistically higher among patients receiving weekly paclitaxel ([ADDRESS_750769] ratio 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67 0.89).  Furthermore, the incidence of serious adverse 
events, neutropenia, neutropenic fever, and peripheral neuropathy were significantly 
lower in weekly taxane schedules ( Mauri et al. 2010 ).  Neurotoxicity, however, is 
atreatment -limiting toxicity for weekly continuous paclitaxel treatment ( Seidman et al. 
2008 ).  Among weekly paclitaxel regimens that have been studied, continuous weekly 
dosing may be associated with more ne urotoxicity than dosing on Days 1,8, and 15 of 
each 28 day-cycle ( Swanton 2006 ; Seidman et al. 2008 ;Miller et al. 2007 ).
In several recent randomized studies of paclitaxel in combination with targeted agents 
versus paclitaxel control, the median PFS seen in patients with HR -positive and
HER2 -negative disease receiving weekly paclitaxel (90 mg/m2 on Days 1,8, and 15 of 
each 28 -day cycle) in the control arm was approximately 7 8 months (E2100, Miller et 
al. 2007 ; RIBBON -1, Robert et al. 2011 ;PEG GY, Vuylsteke et al. 2016 ) in the first -line 
chemotherapy setting.
In Study GO29227 (LOTUS) , paclitaxel was administered in a weekly regimen of 
80mg/m2on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28- day cycle, which maintains the cumulative 
dose i ntensity of paclitaxel when administered Q3W (175 mg/m2, as recommended by 
[CONTACT_571822] i nformation for paclitaxel IV injection [ TaxolUS PI ;Paclitaxel [LOCATION_006] 
PC]).  The control arm (paclitaxel placebo) demonstrated a median PFS of 4.93 months 
(90% CI: 3.58 5.36 months ), which is similar to the efficacy seen in the TNBC 
subgroups of several clinical trials using weekly paclitaxel (90 mg/m2 on Days 1,8, and 
15of each 28-daycycle) as the control arm ( Miller et al. 2007; Miles et al. 2013; Miles et 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
67/Protocol CO40151, Version 6al. 2017 ).In LOTUS, the ipatasertib arm showed an ORR 40% compared to control arm 
of 32% in the ITT population.
Cohort s 1and 4 of the current study will use the same paclitaxel dose and schedule as 
in Study GO29227.  Paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m2on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-daycycle ) is 
considered an appropriate regimen for studying the added effect of ipatasertib in the 
TNBC populations as specified.  
3.3.6 Rationale for Treatment with Nab- Paclitaxel and Choice of 
Nab-Paclitaxel Regimen
Nab-paclitaxe l is an albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel that was developed to 
mitigate the significant t oxicities ass ociated with the vehicles that are nec essary for 
parenteral administrati on of sb-paclitaxel (polyethylated castor oil and polysorbate 80). 
In addi tion, it has an advantageous PK profile compared with sb-paclitaxel and achieves 
a 33% higher tumor uptake in p reclinical models (Yardley 2013). Steroids are routinely 
administered with sb- paclitaxel to lower the risk of hypersensitivity allergic reactions, but 
steroid premedication is not required with the use of nab -paclitaxel.
Nab-paclitaxel received a label from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
the treatment of MBC a fter failure of front -line c ombination chemotherapy for metas tatic 
disea se or relapse within [ADDRESS_750770] udy perform ed by [CONTACT_571823]. (2005 ).However, inreal-worldpractice,
nab-paclitaxel isused th roughout thecontinuum ofcare forpatients withMBC. Both the
NCCN and ESMO clinical practice guidelines include nab -paclitaxel as a standard of 
care that may be administered as a single agent to patients with newly diagnosed 
recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (Cardoso et al. 2017 ;NCCN 2017 ).
The Q3Wdose of nab -paclitaxel (260 mg/ m2) in the FDA label established from the 
Phase III study compari ng sb-paclitaxel with nab -paclitaxel (Gradishar et al. 2005 )isnot
generally used incurrent clinical practice. Instead,weekly dosing ofnab-paclitaxel isthe
most commonly utilized schedule giventhebettertolerability andsugges tionsof
increased efficacy of weekly dosing compared to Q3Wdosing.
The superi ority of the weekly regimen of nab -paclitaxel was first dem onstrated in 
arandomized Phase II st udy conducted in patients with previously untreated MBC 
(Gradishar et al .2009 ).Inthefourarms ofthisstudy, theORRs were 37% withQ3W
nab-paclitaxel, 45% withweekly nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m2(3-weeks -on/1-week -off
schedule), 49% with weekly nab-paclitaxel 150 mg/m2(3-weeks -on/1-week -off 
sche dule), and 35% with Q3Wdocetaxel 100 m g/m2(independent radiologist 
assessment), illustra ting the anti -tumor advantages of the weekly dosing schedule. PFS 
was11.0 months, 12.8 months, 12.9 months ,and 7.5 months (independent radiologist 
assessmen t) for each of the four arms, respectively. The difference in PFS and ORR 
between the 100 -and 1 50-mg/m2weekly dose l evels of nab -paclitaxel was not 
statistically significant, but patients receiving the higher dose experienced a greater 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
68/Protocol CO40151, Version 6incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (44% vs. 25%) and Grade 3 sens ory neuropathy 
(14% vs. 8%).
Subsequent clinical stu dies have not clearly demonstrated t hat weekly doses of
nab-paclitaxel greater t han 100 mg/ m2are more efficacious. Furthermore, higher do ses 
of nab-paclitaxel are associated with greater toxicities. The CALGB 4050 2 Phase III trial 
randomized patients with chemotherapy -naïve, HER2 -negative MBC to r eceive weekly 
paclitaxel, weekly nab -paclitaxel at a higher dose of 150 mg/m2, or ixab epi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], with all 
agents given in combi nation with bevacizumab, and on a 3-weeks -on/1-week -off 
schedule (Rugo et al. 2 012). Nab-paclitaxel wasnottolerable atthishigherweekly dose
anddidnotimprove PFS inanysubtype overstandard dose paclitaxel, leading tothe
conclusion that 150 mg/m2should not be utilized.
To date, 1 00 mg/ m2of nab -paclitaxel weekly on a 3 -weeks -on/1-week -off schedule is the 
best-studied and tolerat ed dose, with suggestio ns of improved efficacy and decreas ed 
toxicities in MBC c ompared with both higher weekly doses and the Q3Wdosing 
schedule of the same drug. As a r esult, su bjects on this st udy will rece ive nab -paclitaxel 
100mg/m2via IV infusi on on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle. 
3.3.7 Rationale for A tezolizumab Dose and Schedule
Atezolizumab will be administered by [CONTACT_22671] a fixed dose of 840mgQ2W, which 
is an approved dosage for atezolizumab (TecentriqU.S. Package Insert).
3.3.[ADDRESS_750771] backbone already in clinical practice 
(Hurwitz et al. 2004; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_109772]. 2009; Bang et al. 2010; Flaherty et al. 2012; Scagliotti 
et al. 2012 ).  One challenge is the need to distinguish the incremental tox icity of the 
combination.  Hamberg et al. (2010) proposes some solutions, including an intra -patient 
control (e.g., by [CONTACT_571824] ).
To explore the effect of stepwise introduction of the treatme nt drugs in the first cycle on 
tolerability, a staggered dosing schedule has been proposed for Cohort 1, Arms C and D
(see Section 3for detailed description of the schedule).  This approach will enable 
abetter understanding of the contribution of individual agents with the goal of refining 
adverse event management guidance.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_750772] each been shown to occur after radiographic evidence of an 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
69/Protocol CO40151, Version 6apparent incr ease in tumor burden.  This initial increase in tumor burden caused by
[CONTACT_246755] a T -cell response has been termed 
“pseudoprogression” (Hales et al. 2010).  In Study PCD4989g, evidence of tumor growth 
followed by a response was observed in several tumor types.   In addition, in some 
responding patients with radiographic evidence of progression, biopsies of new lesions 
or areas of new growth in existing lesions revealed immune cells and no viable cancer 
cells.  Because of the potential for a response after pseudoprogression, this study will 
allow patients in Cohorts 1, 2, and 4to continue combination treatment after apparent 
radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1, provided the benefit risk ratio is judged to 
be favorable by [CONTACT_093] (see criteria in Section 4.6.1 ).  Patients should be 
discontinued for unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical bene fit as determined by [CONTACT_330331], local 
biopsy results (if available), and clinical status . 
3.3.10 Rationale for Pathologic Complete Response as Primary  
Endpoint in Cohort 3
The primary obj ective for Cohort 3 is to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment 
with Ipat Atezo Pac followed by [CONTACT_571825] AC (Arm F) or Ipat Atezo Pac followed by 
[CONTACT_571796]Atezo AC (Arm G) in patients with locally advanced T2 4 TNBC.  pCR was 
selected as the primary efficacy endpoint for Cohort 3.  It is a validated, meaningful 
measure of response to therapy.  Data from several analyses and clinical trials and 
meta -analyses indicate there is a correlation between pCR and long -term clinical benefit
(Liedtke et al. 2008; von Minckwitz et al. 2012; Cortazar et al. 2014).  This correlation 
was especially strong in patients with TNBC (EFS hazard ratio for patients achieving 
pCR vs. patients not achieving pCR: 0.24 [95% CI: 0.18 to 0. 33]; OS hazard ratio for 
patients achieving pCR vs. patients not achieving pCR: 0.16 [95% CI: 0.11 to 0.25]) 
(Cortazar et al. 2014).
pCR will be defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer in the breast and 
absence of residual disease in the lymph n odes (ypT0/Tis ypN0 in the current American 
Joint Committee on Cancer staging system), based on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation 
of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes 
following completion of neoadjuvant therapy, which is in line with the U.S. FDA and

to study drug, are associated with progression to a more severe disease state, are 
associated with acquired resistance to study drug, or can increase the knowledge and 
understanding of disease biology.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Using A rchival Tissue for Examining 
PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -Altered Tumor Status
Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling frequently occurs in breast cancer through activating 
mutations in PIK3CA or AKT1 as well as through alterations in PTEN.   These alterations 
occur in approximately 35% of TNBCs (Pereira et al. 2016).  In the Phase II study 
GO29227, a pre-specified patient population with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors 
as identified using archival or newly obtained biopsy tissue demonstrated a substantial 
benefit from ipatasertib treatment (hazard ratio 0.44, 9 months vs. 4.9 months). 
These considerations support the use of archival tissue (i.e., sample from primary breast 
tumor) or a newly obtained biopsy to determine the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered status 
of the disease to evaluate for a patient population with a higher probability of having 
aclinically meaningful response to ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel.  In the current 
study, PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumor status will be determined using an NGS assay 
(e.g., Foundation Medi cine, Inc. [ FMI]), and the results will be used for secondary and 
exploratory analyses .  Review of PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered status in archival tissue 
and response measures will be performed on an ongoing basis, and in the dose -
expansion cohorts, enrollment may be restricted to patients with tumors demonstrating 
PI3K/Akt pathway activation.
To obtain the most accurate reflection of the patient’s current disease while minimizing 
burden, a specimen from the most recently obtained tumor tissue is requested.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Collection of Blood Sample sfor Non-I nvasive 
Disease Monitoring
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be detected in the blood of patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_294762] (Schwarzenbach et al. 
2011).  For example, the mutational status of tumor cells may be obtained through the 
isolation of ctDNA (Maheswaran et al. 2008), and ctDNA has been used to monitor 
treatment effectiveness in melanoma (Shinozaki et al. 2007).  In the current study, blood 
samples wil l be collected to enable evaluation of oncogenic genetic alterations at 
baseline and to assess for the possible emergence of new alteration a fter treatment with 
ipatasertib, atezolizumab, and taxane .  Genetic alterations will be evaluated in relevant 
genes in the PI3K/Akt pathway (including ,but not limited to ,PIK3CA and AKT1 )and
other cancer -related genes .  Identifying potential discordances in the PIK3CA/AKT1
status between tumor samples and ctDNA may help clarify the prognostic and predictive 
significa nce of PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations in patients with breast cancer treated with 
ipatasertib , atezolizumab, and paclitaxel or nab -paclitaxel.

71/Protocol CO40151, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Collection of DNA  (Blood) for Exploratory  Whole 
Genome Sequencing 
Genomics is increasingly informing rese archer's understanding of disease pathobiology.  
WGS provides a comprehensive characterization of the genome and, along with clinical 
data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity for developi[INVESTIGATOR_76926].  Data will be analyz ed in the context of this study but will also be explored 
in aggregate with data from other studies.  The availability of a larger dataset will assist 
in identification of important pathways, guiding the development of new targeted agents.
For example, genetic variants of drug- metabolizing enzymes and transporters can alter 
the pharmacokinetics of drugs, affecting their safety and efficacy.  For example, patients 
who carry defective alleles of the gene encoding UGT1A1, which facilitates the 
metabolism and excretion of SN -38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), are at higher 
risk for adverse events associated with the use of standard doses of irinotecan (O’Dwyer 
and Catalano 2006).  Preliminary results from in vitro metabolism studies suggest that 
ipatasert ib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_2750] [ADDRESS_750774] the pharmacokinetics of ipatasertib.   The 
decision to analyze the samples will be based on a review of the PK data.  For example, 
if a patient in a given cohort has substantially higher ipatasertib plasma levels than other 
patients in that cohort, he or she may carry a defective allele of a gene important in the 
metabolism or transport of ipatasertib.  The genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_571774].
The pharmacogenetic analysis, if needed, will be performed on identifiable (referring to 
the blinded clinical trial number assigned to the patient at the time of enrollment and not 
to the actual name [CONTACT_571869] i nformation of the patient) DNA samples, 
because it is necessary to link a patient’s PK data with genotype.  This analysis will be 
restricted to the evaluation of genes that may be involved in the pharmacokinetics of 
ipatasertib ( e.g., drug metabolism, disposition, or elimination genes, or genes influencing 
these processes). 
In addition, tumor DNA can contain both reported and unreported chromosomal 
alterations resulting from the tumorigenesis process.  To help control for sequencing 
calls in previously unr eported genomic alterations, the WGS blood sample will help 
determine whether an observed alteration identified in the tumor tissue is somatic 
throughout the evaluation of the DNA isolated in peripheral blood.
This sample for W GS will be collected if approved locally.

72/Protocol CO40151, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Optional Collection of New Tumor Biopsies at 
Disease Progression for Exploratory Purposes , Mandatory 
Collection of Serial Tumor Biopsies for Biopsy  Cohort , and 
Mandatory  Collection of Tumor Tissue from Surgical Resection 
in Cohort 3
Tumor tissue may be collected at the time of disease progression for DNA and/or RNA 
extraction for exploratory NGS or other research on non -inherited biomarkers (including ,
but not limited to ,cancer -related genes and biomarkers associated with co mmon 
molecular and biological pathways). For patients who sign an Optional Research 
Biosample Repository Informed Consent Form, and if tumor biopsies can be obtained 
with minimal risk and discomfort to the patient, a tumor biopsy would be at the time of 
progression within 6 weeks of the progression assessment and prior to initiation of a new 
anti-cancer therapy ; tumor biopsy of the growing lesion is preferred.
Understanding the mechanisms of resistance to the combination of ipatasertib, 
atezolizumab, and p aclitaxel or nab -paclitaxel is critical for the development of agents in 
the PI3K/Akt pathway and may provide an opportunity to develop next -generation 
inhibitors to prevent resistance.
Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be assessed to demonstrate evidence of biologic 
activity of ipatasertib in combination with atezolizumab in patients and will be assessed 
in on- treatment biopsies ,which will be collected from patients who consent to this 
procedure.  Tumor immunobiology, stromal markers, and critical signaling targets of the 
PI3K/Akt signaling cascade may also be analyzed.
Progression biopsy tissue samples will aid in determining a resistance mechanism for 
the combination of ipatasertib, atezolizumab, and paclitaxel or nab -paclitaxel ;may 
potentially influence future therapi[INVESTIGATOR_294764] a PI3K/Akt inhibitor ;
and may be part of a potential substudy.  NGS will be performed by a clinical cancer 
genomic profiling laboratory (e.g., FMI).
Evaluation of tumor tissue samples from surgical rese ction will aid in determining 
aresistance mechanism for the combination of ipatasertib, atezolizumab, AC, and 
paclitaxel ,andmay potentially influence future therapi[INVESTIGATOR_571775]3K/Akt inhibitor .  NGS may be perf ormed by a clinical cancer genomic profiling

3.3.12 Rationale for the Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Schedule
Serum and plasma s amples for PK characterization of atezolizumab andipatasertib
(parent and its metabolite G -037720) , respectively , will be collected as outlined in 
Appendix 4, Appendix 5, andAppendix 6.  The sampling schedule is designed to enable 
characterization of ipatasertib using population PK (popPK) methodology .Inaddition, 
the PK data will allow comparison with single- agent ipatase rtib data from the Phase I 
clinical trial (Study PAM4743g) and with ipatasertib data from other trials to evaluate 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
73/Protocol CO40151, Version 6whether ipatasertib exposures are altered in combination with atezolizumab and 
paclitaxel/nab -paclitaxel .
Paclitaxel is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C8 and CYP3A4.   In vivo, paclitaxel was not 
asensitive substrate of CYP3A4, and exposure did not markedly change in combination 
with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole (Jamis -Dow et al. 1997; Woo et al. 
2003 ).  Given that ipatasertib is a mild- to-moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 (Study 
PAM4743g; see the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure for details) and is not an inhibitor 
of CYP2C8, ipatasertib is not expected to alter paclitaxel exposure.  Data from Study 
PAM4983g showed that paclitaxel and ipatasertib pharmacokinetics, when administered 
in combination, were comparable with their respective single -agent data, providing 
evidence that ipatasertib does not alter paclitaxel exposure .  Therefore, paclitaxel 
pharmacokinetics will no t be evaluated in this study.
In the biopsy cohort, samples will also be collected to measure coproporphyrin I and III, 
which are putatively transported into the liver by [CONTACT_571826]1B1 and 
OATP1B3. The levels of these endogenous substrates of OATP transporters will be 
measured in an exploratory way to understand the impact of ipatasertib on OATP 
functionality .
Doxorubicin is not a substrate of CYP3A and is not reported to be a CYP3A4 inhibitor or 
inducer in vivo.  As such, no drug drug inter action is expected between doxorubicin and 
ipatasertib.  Therefore, doxorubicin pharmacokinetics will not be evaluated in this study.
CYP3A4 does not play a major role in metabolism of cyclophosphamide ,and 
cyclophosphamide is not reported to be a CYP3A4 i nhibitor or inducer in vivo. As such, 
no drug drug interaction is expected between cyclophosphamide and ipatasertib. 
Therefore, cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics will not be evaluated in this study.
Any remaining PK samples after evaluation of atezolizumab, ipatasertib, and its 
metabolite may be used for exploratory evaluation of other analytes related to the 
administered drugs or biomarkers , enzymes ,and transporters affecting their disposition.

4.3.3 Other Treatments: Premedications and Prophylactic Treatment
Because of the known potential for allergic reactions to paclitaxel and/or the 
Cremophorvehicle, precautions must be taken to decrease the risk of anaphylaxis.  
Patients must be premedicated prior to paclitaxel with dexamethasone, 
diphenhydramine, and an H 2-receptor blocker (i.e., ranitidine or famotidine) or per 
institutional practice. H2-receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine, which are known to 
inhibit cytochrome P450, are excluded.
In general, chemotherapy supportive care should be administered per ASCO, European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ), or European Society for 
Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines or institutional practice .  In Cohort 3, filgrastim or 
pegfilgrastim must be used in conjunction with each AC administration.  
Chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting prophylaxis and treatment should be 
administered as clinically indicated.  It is highly recommended that aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_571779].  Because systemic 
corticosteroids may attenuate the potential beneficial immunologic effects of treatment 
with atezolizumab, alternative agents should be considere d when clinically feasible 
(see Section 4.4.2 for further guidance).
Diarrhea is a common adverse event associated with ipatasertib and atezolizumab, and 
sometimes with chemotherapy treatment. In this current study, to improve diarrhea 
management and patient experiences, loperamide (2 mg twice a day ) will be 
administered daily as prophy laxis for diarrhea in the first cycle.  If side effects are not 
tolerated, doses may be reduced.  Investigators are encouraged to continue this dosing 
for the remainder of the study using their discretion based on clinical judgments.
Treatment modification s for diarrhea (any grade), when it occurs, should be instituted as 
early as possible.  Guidelines for treatment of diarrhea following the prophylactic dose of 
loperamide ind icate use of loperamide 2 mg every 4 hours or after each loose, watery 
stool, up to the maximum total dose of 16 mg/day or per institutional guidelines and 
standard of care .If diarrhea control is inadequate despi[INVESTIGATOR_571780], additional anti -diarrheal agents may be 
usedper institutional standards of care such as Lomotil(diphenoxylate and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), 
codeine, or octreotide.  Duration of diarrhea may be minimized by [CONTACT_398238], avoiding lactose -containing foods, and hydrating with 810glasses per day 
(~12 oz/glass) of electrolyte- containing clear liquid, such as broth or low -calorie drinks.  

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
90/Protocol CO40151, Version 6For diarrhea that persists for more than 5 days, despi[INVESTIGATOR_40792] -diarrheal 
agent (s) and/or withholding dosing of ipatasertib, gastroenterologists should be 
consulted to rule out the risk of colitis and infection (e.g., obtaining CT images or a stool 
culture for infectious workup [Clostridium difficile, enteric bacteria, cytomegaloviru s]).  
Patients should be educated on the symptoms and importance of early reporting of 
diarrhea to receive instructions of treatment and prevention of dehydration so that 
patients can be promptly and appropriately managed. Educational materials will be 
provided to investigators and patients outlining these guidelines. 
If diarrhea occurs, it should be managed per guidelines in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ; upon 
resolution or when study treatment is restarted, loperamide prophylaxis should be 
considered to resume and continue based on clinical judgments.
Additionally, patients who experience di arrhea may have fecal samples collected to test 
fecal calprotectin, at the investigator 's discretion, to provide additional information for 
aiding the Sponsor in understanding how to better guide future diarrhea management .
Because of the risk of rash, pat ients should receive the following prophylactic treatment, 
unless contraindicated, during the first cycle in which all three study treatments 
(ipatasertib, atezolizumab, and taxane) are to be given in Cohorts [ADDRESS_750796] 28 days (i.e., W eeks 14) in which all fourstudy treatments (ipatasertib, 
atezolizumab, and AC) are to be given in Cohort 3:On days when patients will receive 
atezolizumab, patients should receive at least 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) as 
premedicat ion, followed by a fixed dose of 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for 
24consecutive days thereafter.   The timing of corticosteroid administration on days 
when patients will receive atezolizumab and paclitaxel will be determined by [CONTACT_571831].   In addition, patients should receive 
daily oral antihistamine for at least the first cycle in which all three treatments (four 
treatments for Cohort 3) are to be given.  It is suggested that a non -sedating oral 
antihistam ine (such as loratadine, cetirizine, or fexofenadine) and a longer -acting 
formulation be used.  Protocol -required premedication should be omitted on the day of 
paclitaxel infusion if already administered as taxane premedication per institutional 
practice.

patient may continue ipatasertib treatment after treatment holding has been 
completed and the patient has sufficiently recovered.
For Cohort 2 only: radiotherapy to the brain as outlined bel ow:
History of radiotherapy (either stereotactic radiosurgery or whole -brain radiation 
therapy) to the brain is allowed provided that all of the following criteria are met:
–The patient has no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after 
completion of CNS -directed therapy.
–The most recent radiotherapy to the brain is completed more than 14 days 
prior to study treatment initiation.
–The patient has no ongoing requirement for corticosteroids as therapy for 
CNS disease
Patients who require corticosteroid therapy for more than 7 days after 
completion of radiotherapy may receive study treatment following 
Medical Monitor approval.
–Anti-convulsant therapy, if required, is administered at a stable dose
Premedication with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or analgesics prior to 
atezolizumab or paclitaxel administration
Prophylaxis use of loperamide ( or racecadotril , which may more commonly beused
in Europe) 
Treatment with loperamide is mandated in the first cycle and as clinically 
indicated in subsequent cycles to prevent diarrhea.  Patients who experience 
diarrhea should be on treatment doses of loperamide per the management 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
93/Protocol CO40151, Version 6guidelines provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ;please refer to that section for additional 
details.  Patients are asked to be cognizant of the onset, duration, severity, and 
frequency of symptoms and the medications administered.   
For patients receiving paclitaxel, treatment with g ranulocyte colony -stimulating 
factor
The primary prophylaxis should be administered per the ASCO, European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer , and ESMO guidelines; 
namely, in patients who are 60 years of age a nd/or with comorbidities 
(Smith et al. 2006; Aapro et al. 2011).
For p atients receiving bisphosphonates or denosumab prior to enrollment, 
maintenance on bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy during screening and while 
actively treated with study drug
Both types of agents have potential immunomodulatory properties , but may be 
used as clinically indicated.
Luteinizing hormone -releasing hormone agonists for ovarian function preservation 
Prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as warfarin at a stable 
dose or low -molecular -weight heparin)
Inactivated influenza vaccinations
Megestrol acetate administered as an appetite stimulant after initiation of study 
treatment
Mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone)
Inhaled corticost eroids administered for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or 
asthma
Low-dose corticosteroids administered for orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency
Acute, low -dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one -time pulse dose 
of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., [ADDRESS_750798] allergy) 
For Cohort 3:  G -CSF (i.e., filgrastim or pegfilgrastim)
G-CSF is permitted for patients receiving chemotherapy and is required when 
patients are receiving AC.  G-CSF should be administered as primary 
prophylaxis per the ASCO, EORTC, or ESMO guidelines (Smith et al. 2006; 
Crawford et al. 2009; Aapro et al. 2011) or institutional practice . 
In general, investigators should manage a patient’s care with supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_571781].  Patients who experience 
infusion- associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H2 -receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine) , or 
equivalent medications per local standard practice.  Serious infusion- associated events 
manifested by [CONTACT_27926], hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced

4.4.[ADDRESS_750799] 7 days before and after 
the procedure (at least 14 days after radiation is recommended).  After the temporar y 
treatment hold is complete, study treatment may be re -initiated with Medical Monitor 
approval when the patient has sufficiently recovered.
Systemic corticosteroids and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) inhibitors may attenuate 
potential beneficial immunolo gic effects of treatment with atezolizumab.  Therefore, in 
situations in which systemic corticosteroids or TNF- inhibitors would be routinely 
administered, alternatives, including antihistamines, should be considered.  If the 
alternatives are not feasible , systemic corticosteroids and TNF- inhibitors may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator.
Systemic corticosteroids are recommended, at the discretion of the investigator, for the 
treatment of specific immune- mediated adverse events when associated with 
atezolizumab (refer to Appendix 13for details).
[IP_ADDRESS] Medications Given w ith Precaution due to Effects Relat ed to 
CYP450 Enzy mes
In vitro data suggest that ipatasertib is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A and may be a 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  A clinical drug drug interaction study with 
midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) showed a 2.2 -fold increase in midazola m 
exposur es in presence of steady -state i patasertib dosed at 600 mg QD.  Therefore, 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic window should be avoided.  Given 
that ipatasertib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A, there is a high potential for 
drugdrug interactions of ipatasertib with any medication that strongly inhibits or induces 
CYP3A.  Data from a clinical study showed that ipatase rtib exposures were reduced by 
[CONTACT_3450] 50% when co- administered with enzalutamide, a strong CYP3A inducer.  
Itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased ipatasertib AUC and C maxby 
[CONTACT_3450] 5-fold and 2- fold, respectively (Study GP30057).  As such, other strong 
CYP3A inhibitors are expected to increase ipatasertib exposures.  Therefore, the 
following dr ugs should be avoided or used with caution. 
Strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, 
indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconaz ole, and/or grapefruit juice 
Strong CYP3A4/5 inducers, such as, but not limited to, rifampin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , 
rifapentine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and/or St. John’s wort or hyperforin
CYP3A4/5 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
95/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Paclitaxel exposures may be increased due to CYP2C8 inhibition; therefore, strong and 
moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors, such as gemfibrozil, teriflunomide, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], and 
deferasirox should be used with caution during treatment with paclitaxel. Similarly, 
CYP2C8 inducer s should be avoided or used with caution. 
Caution should be exercised when nab -paclitaxel is concomitantly administered with 
known inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, riton avir, saquinavir, and telithromycin) and 
inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John’s Wort ,and 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]).  Caution should also be exercised when nab -paclitaxel is concomitantly 
administered with known inhibitors of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) and inducers of 
CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin).
Patients who require short -term use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or use of sensitive 
CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic window for medical treatment (i.e., an 
alternative treatment cann ot be used) must exercise caution and all study treatment 
should be temporarily held until at least [ADDRESS_750800] dose of these drugs.
Patients are permitted to take moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 /5with caution .
Patients should be closely monitored.  Refer to the following information for further 
guidance on CY P450 drug interactions and a list of common substrates, inhibitors, and 
inducers: 
Drug Development and Drug Interactions:  Table of Substrates, Inhibitors and 
Inducers (U.S. FDA):  http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ 
DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm
The above lists of medications are not comprehensive.  The investigator should consult 
the prescribing information when determining whether a c oncomitant medication can be 
safely administered with study treatment.  In addition, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_294857].
[IP_ADDRESS] Herbal Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_204719], safety profiles, and potential drug drug interactions are generally 
unknown.  However, herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_204720] 
(see Section 4.4.3 ) may be used during the study at the discretion of the investigator.
4.4.3 Prohibited Therapy
Use of the following concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_123420]:
Investigational therapy (other than protocol -mandated study treatment ) is prohibited 
within 14days prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment.
Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited 
to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
96/Protocol CO40151, Version 6therapy), whether health authority approved or experimental, is prohibited for 
various time periods prior to starting study treatment, depending on the agent (see 
Section 4.1.2 ), and during study treatment, until disease progression is documented 
and the patient has discontinued study treatment, with the exception of palliative 
radiotherapy and local therapy under certain circumstances (see Section 4.4.1 for 
details).
Quinidine or other anti -arrhythmic agents with narrow therapeutic index
Stable doses of calcium -channel blockers are permitted.
Stable doses of -blockers, if an alternative treatment cannot be used, are 
permitted with caution.
Chronic use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer, or sensitive CYP3A 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic window that are deemed not permissible by [CONTACT_571835] r after enrollment (refer to the guidance in Section 4.4.2 )
Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are prohibited within [ADDRESS_750801] dose of cyclophosphamide ,whichever occurs later .
Systemic immunostimulatory age nts (including, but not limited to, interferons and 
interleukin 2) are prohibited within 4 weeks or 5half-lives of the drug, whichever is 
longer, prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment because 
these agents could potentially incr ease the risk for autoimmune conditions when 
given in combination with atezolizumab.
Systemic immunosuppressive medications (including, but not limited to, 
cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide) are prohibited 
during study treatment because these agents could potentially alter the efficacy and 
safety of atezolizumab.
4.4.4 Prohibited Food
Use of the following foods is prohibited as described below:
Consumption of grapefruit juice, a potent CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor, is prohibited 
during th e study treatment period and for [ADDRESS_750802] dose of study 
treatment.
Consumption of St. John’s wort, a potent CYP3A4 enzyme inducer, is prohibited for 
up to 14 days prior to and during the study treatment period.
4.4.5 Additional Restrictions
No fo od or fluids other than water will be allowe d for 8 hours prior to each Day 1 study 
visit until after study laboratory samples for fasting glucose and fasting lipid profile, as 
applicable, are obtained (see Appendix 1,Appendix 2,andAppendix 3).

97/Protocol CO40151, Version 64.[ADDRESS_750803] be performed and documented for each 
patient.  
Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study.  
Patients should be assessed for toxicity prior to each dose; dosing will occur only if the 
clinical assessment and local laboratory test values are acceptable.
4.5.[ADDRESS_750804] 
be obtained before performing any study -related procedures (including screening 
evaluations or submission of archival tissues).  Informed Consent Forms for enrolled 
patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the 
study site.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed by [CONTACT_22951] M onitor to 
confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria before enrollment.  The investigator will 
maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm 
eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
4.5.2 Medical History , Concomitant Medication, and Demographic 
Data
Medical history, including clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history 
(including prior cancer t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), and reproductive status, will be 
recorded at baseline.  In addition, all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, 
over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional 
supplements) used by [CONTACT_25701] 14days prior to initiation of study treatment will 
be recorded.  At the time of each follow -up physical examination, an interval medical 
history should be obtained and any changes in medications and allergies should be 
recorded.
Further, to assess complia nce with specific medications and incidence of certain 
adverse events , patients will complete a diary each day. Patients will receive the diary 
on the first day of each cycle and complete their portion at home, with site staff 
completing other informatio n during clinic visits .
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity.
4.5.3 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination, performed at screening and other specified visits, 
should include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears , nose, and throat, and the 
cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
98/Protocol CO40151, Version 6genitourinary, and neurological systems.  Any abnormality identified at baseline should 
be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Cond itions eCRF.
Limited, targeted, symptom -directed physical examinations should be performed at 
specified postbaseline visits and as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline 
abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically s ignificant 
abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.
4.5.[ADDRESS_750805] 5 minutes, respi[INVESTIGATOR_81725] ( oral, axillary, temporal ,or tympanic ).
On chemotherapy dosing days, vital signs should be recorded prior to dosing and at the 
end of the infusion.  
4.5.[ADDRESS_750806] be documented at screening and re -assessed at each 
subsequent tumor evaluation.  Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_294860] (with photography measurements) and imaging (CT, 
magn etic resonance imaging [ MRI], and bone scans) through use of RECIST v1.1 (see 
Appendix 10).  Images for tumor assessments will be collected to enable retrospective 
blinded independent central review when needed. The same radiographic procedure 
used to assess disease sites at scree ning should be used throughout the study (e.g., the 
same contrast protocol for CT scans). To be suitable for RECIST assessments, CT and 
MRI scans should have a maximum thickness of 5 mm and no gaps. Assessments 
should be performed by [CONTACT_22960] t o ensure internal consistency across visits. 
An objective response should be confirmed by [CONTACT_294862] 4weeks after initial 
documentation.  At the investigator’s discretion, and if clinically indicated, CT scans may 
be repeated at any time if pro gressive disease is suspected , and other methods of 
assessment of measurable disease may be used ( e.g., brain scans using CT or MRI) in 
addition to those listed above.   For symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease 
progression, every effort should be made to document progression through use of 
objective criteria per RECIST v1.1.  
Baseline tumor assessments should be performed 28days before Day 1, Cycle 1.  
Contrast -enhanced (IV and oral) CTor (IV) MRI scans should include chest, abdomen, 
and pelvic scans; CT scans of the neck should be included if clinically indicated.  
Screening (or documented standard -of-care) bone scans (technetium bone scan) and 
head scans (CT or MRI) should be performed within 6 weeks before Day 1, Cycle 1.  
Tumor assessments should be performed based on a schedule calculated from Cycle 1, 
Day1 (study Day 1) with the first assessment during W eek 8 and every 8 weeks 
thereafter, regardless of treatment administration timings or pri or early/late tumor 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
99/Protocol CO40151, Version 6assessments. Therefore, the window for each scan will be the 7 days of the given week.  
For patients with known or suspected bone metastasis, follow -up bone scans should be 
performed during Days 16 28 of every fourth cycle (every 16 we eks).   Bone disease and 
any changes in bone imaging should be evaluated radiographically by [CONTACT_3610], MRI, or 
X-ray to ascertain the presence of bone destruction versus a healing reaction.  An 
assessment must be done at the treatment completion visit, unles s the most recent 
tumor assessment was completed 6 weeks before the treatment completion visit.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment for any reason other than disease progression 
will continue to undergo tumor response evaluations at disease follow -up visits 
approximately every 8 12weeks and undergo bone scans (if indicated) approximately 
every [ADDRESS_750807]- of-care tumor assessment performed within 28 days before 
Cycle 1, Day 1 (bone or head scans within 6 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1) may be used 
for the screening assessment, provided it meets the following requirements:
CT scans are the preferred imaging modality for tumor assessments.  Tumor 
assessments should include a diagn ostic quality, contrast -enhanced CT scan of the 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis at baseline.  CT scans of the neck should be included if 
clinically indicated.  To be suitable for RECIST assessments, CT scans should have 
a maximum thickness of [ADDRESS_750808], abdomen, and pelvis and other known sites of 
disease.  
In patients for whom a CT scan is contraindicated because of an allergy to 
IVradiographic contrast, both a CT scan of the chest without contrast and a MRI 
scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast are recommended.
MRI scans may be performed in lieu of CT scans.  However, an MRI scan of the 
chest may be performed only with the approval of the Sponsor.  At screening, tumor 
assessments should include a diagnostic quality, contrast -enhanced MRI scan of 
the chest (if approved), abdomen, and pelvis.  MRI scans of the neck should be 
included if clinically indicated.  To be suitable for RECIST assessments, MRI scans 
should ideally have a ma ximum thickness of [ADDRESS_750809] (if approved), abdomen, 
and pelvis, and other known sites of disease. 
4.5.6 Disease A ssessments and Management for Cohort 3
[IP_ADDRESS] Disease Status A ssessment
Assessments of primary tumor and regional lymph nodes must be done by [CONTACT_571836], within [ADDRESS_750810], preferably through use of calipers or a ruler or tape measure.  The main purpose 
of performing physical examination sprior to each cycle is for patient safety and to rule 
out progressive disease that would lead to study treatment discontinuation. 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
100/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Additional disease assessments (e.g., liver function tests, radiographs) may be 
performed when c linically indicated to exclude metastatic disease, as per current 
institutional practice.  Whenever possible, disease recurrence should be confirmed 
pathologically.
[IP_ADDRESS] Ultrasound of Breast and A xilla 
Ultrasound of the breast and axilla is mandated during scr eening and within [ADDRESS_750811] approach prior to neoadjuvant therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS] Mammograms
A baseline bilateral mammogram is required.  The unaffected breast should beimaged 
within [ADDRESS_750812] should be 
imaged within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment .  Mammograms are optional
during neoadjuvant treatment (i.e., may be performed at the investigator’s discretion).  
Results from optional mammograms are not required to be entered into the eCRF.  
Abilateral mammogram is required within 14 days prior to surgery . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Radiographic Assessments
Additional Breast Imaging
Additional breast imaging such as MRI is not mandated by [CONTACT_571837]'s discretion per local practice.  If MRI is conducted, 
suggested timelines for MRI are within [ADDRESS_750813] imaging (other than mammograms) should be entered into the eCRF.  
Baseline Distant -Site Tumor A ssessments
Baseline distant -site tumor staging procedures should be performed in alignment with 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or national guidelines, within 28 days 
prior to initiation of treatment . 
Per NCCN guidelines, baseline staging procedures are based on clinical stage as 
outlined below: 
Stage II and Stage IIIA:  A bone scan should be performed in the presence of bone 
pain and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis 
should be performed in case of elevated alkaline phosphatase, abnorm al liver 
function tests, abdominal symptoms, or abnormal ph ysical examination.  A chest 
CTscan should be performed for all patients. 
Stage IIIB and Stage IIIC:  A bone scan and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis should be performed for all patients.
Additional radiographic modalities may be considered when clinically indicated to 
exclude metastatic disease. 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
101/Protocol CO40151, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Measurements
The tumor site must be marked with a radiopaque marker via radiographic guidance 
(e.g., ultrasound) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.  Tumors should be measured 
at screening and within [ADDRESS_750814] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) through use of
conventional techniques ( most commonly mammogram, but may be supplemented as 
clinically indicated with positron emission tomography [PET] scan, CT scan, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, or X -ray).  If possible, these measurements 
should be conducted by [CONTACT_571838].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph Node Assessment sand Staging
Patients who have clinically negative axillary nodes by [CONTACT_571839] (e.g., ultrasound) at screening should be staged as node negative.   
Patients with clinically negative axillary nodes may undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy 
(SLNB) prior to neoadjuvant therapy if consistent with institutional guidelines. If SLNB is 
conducted, it is strongly recommended that more than one lymph node ( two to three
minimum) be removed .  Patients with a positive SLNB result (involved with invasive 
carcinoma) are ineligible to participate in the study.
Patients who have enlarged or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_571783] g (e.g., cortical thickness 2 mm) at screening should undergo 
fine-needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) or core -needle biopsy prior to enrollment.   Patients with 
apositive biopsy result (pN1 N3c) should be staged as node positive ,and patients with 
anegative (pN0) or equivocal (pNX) biopsy result should be staged as node negative 
regardless of any other clinical measurements (see Appendix 14).
Patients who have clinically negative axillary nodes but have clinically positive internal 
mammary, subpectoral infraclavicular, or supraclavicular lymph nodes are not required 
to undergo FNA or core-needle biopsy.
[IP_ADDRESS] Surgical Plan and Procedures
Patients shou ld be evaluated at screening by a surgeon with experience in breast cancer 
surgery.  The surgeon will propose a surgical treatment plan , which should be 
documented in the eCRF.  Patients should be reassessed after completion of 
neoadjuvant therapy (prior t o surgery ), and the surgeon will determine whether to 
proceed with the proposed plan or a modified plan .  The final surgical treatment plan
should be documented in the eCRF. 
Patients should undergo breast surgery between 2and 6 weeks after the final dose of 
neoadjuvant therapy.  Pre -operative laboratory tests should be performed as per
institutional practice.  
All patients with T4 tumors should undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) at the 
time of surgery , unless not aligned with institutional gui delines .  Patients without 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
102/Protocol CO40151, Version 6T4tumors who are node positive (pN1N3c) as determined by [CONTACT_571840] -needle 
biopsy should undergo ALND at the time of surgery.   Patients without T4 tumors who are 
node negative as det ermined by [CONTACT_571841], or by 
[CONTACT_571840] -needle biopsy (pN0 or pNX) ,should undergo ALND or SLNB at the time of 
surgery (see Appendix 14).
For patients who undergo SLNB, it is strongly recommended that more than one lymph 
node ( two to three minimum) be removed and that all patients with positive 
macrometastases in sentinel nodes undergo ALND regardless of the number of positive 
nodes.
[IP_ADDRESS] Surgica l Specimen Pathology
The primary efficacy endpoint (pCR) will be established via local review following 
completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.  Guidelines regarding pathology 
specimen preparation, labeling, and review are outlined in the Pathology Manual.  The 
Sponsor will prospectively collect local pathology reports.
[IP_ADDRESS] Confirmation of Disease Progression or Second Primary  
Cancer
During neoadjuvant treatment, diagnosis of disease progression or second primary 
cancer should be supported by [CONTACT_2085], laboratory, radiologic, and/or (preferably) 
histologic findings.  The designation of disease progression, whether local, regional, or 
distant, or a diagnosis of a second primary cancer can be made only when clinical, 
laboratory, radiologic, and/or histologi c findings support the diagnosis.  
Disease follow -up will end at the study completion or early termination visit, scheduled to 
occur not more than 60 days after the final dose of study treatment (refer to schedule of 
activities in Appendix 3for details)
4.5.7 Laboratory , Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples
Laboratory samples should be drawn according to the schedule of activities (see
Appendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3) and within 48 hours prior to study drug 
administration at the clinic; res ults of hematology, chemistry ,and pregnancy tests should 
be available to assess dosing decision. Screening local laboratory assessments 
obtained 48hours before Cycle 1, Day [ADDRESS_750815] to be repeated for Cycle 1, 
Day1. 
Samples for the following la boratory tests will be sent to the study site's local laboratory

screening (must be performed within 48 hours prior to Cycle 1, Day 1).  
Urine/serum pregnancy tests will be performed at specified subsequent visits.  
Ifaurine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy 
test.
A woman is considered to be of childbearing pot ential if she is postmenarcheal, 
has not reached a postmenopausal state ( 12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not 
undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).
Screening viral serology:  HIV, HBsAg, total HBcAb , HCV antibody ; additional tests 
for HBV DNA or HCV RNA will be required to confirm eligibility in patients with 
apositive antibody result.
The following samples will be sent to the Sponsor or a designee for analysis:
Feca l sample for calprotectin test(optional)
Plasma or serum samples for PK analysis through use of a validated assay
Serum samples for assessment of ADAs to atezolizumab through use of a validated 
assay

104/Protocol CO40151, Version 6PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumor status (using the FMI NGS assay) and for 
exploratory research on biomarkers
A representative FFPE tumor specimen in a paraffin block (preferred) or at least 
20(for Cohorts 1 and 2) or 15 (for Cohorts 3 and 4) slides containing unstained, 
freshly cut, serial sections should be submitted prior to planned stud y 
enrollment date. 
Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content. 
Samples collected via resection, core -needle biopsy (at least three cores, 
embedded in a single paraffin block), or excisional, incisional, punch, or force ps 
biopsy are acceptable.  FNA (defined as samples that do not preserve tissue

For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.
Unless the patient gives specific consent for his or her leftover samples to be stored for 
optional exploratory research (see Sect ion 4.5.11 ), biological samples will be destroyed 
when the final Clinical Study Report has been completed, with the following exceptions:
Plasma samples collected for PK or immunogenicity analysis may be needed for 
additional or immunogenicity characterization ,PK and immunogenicity assay 
development and validation , and evaluation of ipatasertib metabolites or its 
disposition rel ated markers ; therefore, these samples will be destroyed no later than 
5 years after the final Clinical Study Report has been completed.
Blood samples collected for W GS(if approved locally) will be stored until they are 
no longer needed or until they are exhausted.  However, the storage period will be 
in accordance with the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee 
(IRB/EC) -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health 
authority requirements).
Tumor tissue and plasma samples collected for biomarker research will be 
destroyed no later than 5 years after the final Clinical Study Report has been

4.5.8 Electrocardiograms and Cardiac Function A ssessment
A cardiac function assessment by [CONTACT_6751] (ECHO) or multiple -gated acquisition
(MUGA) scan (ECHO preferred for Cohort 3) should be performed within 12 weeks of 
Day1 of Cycle 1, with additional assessments performed for Cohort 3 on Day 1 of 
Cycle 3 and at the study completion or early termination visit .  If the LVEF result as 
assessed by [CONTACT_571843][INVESTIGATOR_1103], the investigator may choose an alternative modality (i.e., cardiac MRI), if this is 
consistent with local standard practice.   The same technique used for baseline cardiac 
evaluation should be used throughout the study.
Single 12-lead ECG recordings will be ob tained at specified timepoints, as outlined in the 
schedule of activities (see Appendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3) and may be 
obtained at unscheduled timepoints as indicated. In Cohort 3, a 12- lead ECG will be 
obtained during screening, at each doxorubicin administration ( Days 1and 15 of 
Cycles 12), at study completion/early termination visit ,and as clinically indicated.  
Screening ECG assessments obtained 48hours before Day [ADDRESS_750817] 10 minutes.  All ECGs are to be obtained prior to other 
procedures scheduled at that same time (e.g., vital sign measurements, blood draws) 
and should not be obtained within 3 hours after any meal.  Circumstances that may 
induce changes in h eart rate, including environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, 
conversation) should be avoided during the pre -ECG resting period and during ECG 
recording.

drug discontinuation should be made, as described in Sections 5.2.1 and 4.6.1 .  The 
investigator should also evaluate the patient for potential concurrent risk facto rs 
(e.g., electrolyte abnormalities, co -medications known to prolong the QT interval, severe 
bradycardia).
4.5.9 Mandatory  Samples for Whole Genome Sequencing
At participating sites, blood samples will be collected for DNA extraction to enable W GS 
to identify ge rmline mutations and somatic mutations that are predictive of response to 
study drug, are associated with progression to a more severe disease state, are 
associated with acquired resistance to study drug, are associated with susceptibility to 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_571784], or can increase the knowledge and understanding of 
disease biology.  The blood samples may be sent to one or more laboratories for 
analysis .
Collection and submission of W GS samples is contingent upon the review and approval 
of the explorator y research by [CONTACT_25733]'s IRB/EC and, if applicable, an appropriate 
regulatory body.  If a site has not been granted approval for WGS  sampling, this section 
of the protocol (Section 4.5.9 ) will not be applicable at that site.
Genomics is increasingly informing researchers’ understanding of disease pathobiology.  
WGS provides a comprehensive characterization of the genome and, along with clinical 
data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity for developi[INVESTIGATOR_76926].  Data will be analyzed in the context of this study but will also be explored 
in aggregate with data from other studies.  The availability of a larger dataset will assist 
in identification of important pathways, guiding the development of new targeted agents.
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.  
Blood samples collected for W GS are to be stored until they are no longer needed or 
until they are exhausted.  However, the storage period will be in accordance with the 
IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).

4.5.11 Optional Samples for Research Biosample Repository
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview  of the Research Biosample Repository
The Research Biosample Repository (RBR) is a centrally administered group of facilities 
used for the long- term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid 
tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The collection, 
storage, and analysis of RBR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new 
pharmaceutical agen ts and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for 
individualized drug therapy for patients in the future.
Specimens for the RBR will be collected from patients who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional research.  RBR specimens will be used to achieve the 
following objectives:
To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or disease 
progression
To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology
To study drug response, including drug effects and th e processes of drug absorption 
and disposition
To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays

117/Protocol CO40151, Version 65.1.9 Management of Patients Who Experience Specific A dverse 
Events 
There will be no dose modifications for atezolizumab in this study.  
Patients ma y hold ipatasertib for up to 4 consecutive weeks (approximately 
28consecutive days ) in order to recover from toxicity or an adverse event related to the 
study drug.  If any of the three study treatments are discontinued, the o ther study 
treatments may be continued independent of each other (i.e., i fthe ipatasertib is 
discontinued at any time during the study, patients may have the option of continuing on 
study with atezolizumab and chemotherapy or atezolizumab alone or chemotherapy 
alone ).
Ifthe patient does not tolerate the QD dosing of ipatasertib , dosing with food may be 
used to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea.  
For Cohorts 1 , 2,and 4and fo r Arms G1 and G2 of Cohort 3, the dose of ipatasertib can 
be reduced by 100 mg once a day (one dose level) decrements up to two times for 
management of drug -related toxicities (i.e., from 400 to 300 mg and then from 300 to 
200mg) as outlined in Table 3.  If further dose reduction is indicated after two dos e 
reductions for a specified drug -related adverse event, the patient must discontinue 
ipatasertib but may continue treatment with atezol izumab and chemotherapy or 
atezolizumab alone or chemotherapy alone atthe investigator’s discretion.

cyclophosphamide -associated toxicities, refer to the local prescribing information for 
each agent. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Interruption for Toxicities
Atezolizumab treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing toxicity 
considered to be related to study treatment.  If corticosteroids are initiated for treatment 
of the toxicity, they must be tapered over 1month to 10mg/day oral prednisone or 
equivalent before atezolizumab can be resumed.  If atezolizumab is withheld for 
12weeks , the patient will be discontinued from atezolizumab.  However, atezolizumab 
may be withheld for 12weeks to allow for patients to taper off corticosteroids prior to 
resuming treatment.  Atezolizumab can be resumed after being withheld for 12weeks if 
the Medical Monitor agrees that the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit.  
Atezolizumab treatment may be suspended for re asons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical 
procedures) with Medical Monitor’s approval.  The investigator and the Medical Monitor 
will determine the acceptable length of treatment interruption. Following discussion with 
the Medical Monitor, the investigator may determine the acceptable length of treatment 
interruption based on sound medical and clinical judgment, and taking into co nsideration 
the overall benefit risk for the patient.
Ipatasertib treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing toxicity 
considered to be related to study treatment.  If corticosteroids are initiated for treatment 
of the toxicity, they must be tapered to 10mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent before 
ipatasertib can be resumed, if clinically appropriat e.  If ipatasertib is withheld for 
28days, the patient will be discontinued from ipatasertib.  If the investigator believes 
the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit and the Medical Monitor is in agreement, 
ipatasertib treatment can be resumed af ter being withheld for 28days. Steroids used 
as prophylaxis (i.e., prior to scans, as protocol -directed rash prophylaxis, or prior to 
taxane or atezolizumab) do not require holding of ipatasertib.  Steroids used on a single 
day to manage IRRs or allerg ic reactions similarly do not require holding of ipatasertib.
If either atezolizumab or ipatasertib is discontinued, the other drug along with 
chemotherapy can be continued if the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit, as 
determined by [CONTACT_571846].
For guidelines regarding treatment interruption rules fordoxorubicin -or 
cyclophosphamide -associated toxicities, refer to the local prescribing information for 
each agent. 
[IP_ADDRESS] General Guidelines
General guidelines for dosage/schedule modification are summarized as follows:
Ifany treatment component is interrupted (dose hold), the study cycle day count 
continues and does not shift (i.e., every cycle contains exactly 28 days ).
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
120/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Ifipatasertib treatment is i nterrupted, atezolizumab and chemotherapy treatment 
should continue as applicable .
Ifchemotherapy treatment is interrupted, consider delaying the ipatasertib and 
atezolizumab treatment concurrently for up to 7 days (i.e., shifting the 7 days -off 
week for ipatasertib so that 21 daily doses in every 28 days ismaintained), at the 
discretion of the investigator. The interrupted dose of chemotherapy may be 
administered later in the same cycle, ideally on Day 22, taking into consideration the 
chemotherapy dosi ng starting on Day 1 of the next cycle.
Given the complexity of this triple drug combination’s schedule, although there are 
pre-specified windows allowed around dosing days, it is strongly suggested that 
taxane chemotherapy administration only be on D ay 1, Day 8, Day 15, (or D ay 22 
as a day to compensate for missed chemotherapy on any of the 3 prior da ys), and 
that atezolizumab be given on D ay1 or D ay15.  If dosing is not feasible on those 
days, it is acceptable and encouraged to dose on the next suggested day using 
above guidance.  Sites are encouraged to reach out to the Medical Monitor for any 
guidance on this matter.  
Iftoxicity causes chemothera pytreatment to be omitted, clinic visits (and study 
procedures) associated with the administration of chemotherapy in that cycle may 
also be omitted.  However, laboratory assessments and clinical visits should be 
scheduled as needed for follow -up of adver se events.  In addition, tumor 
assessmen ts, as outlined in the schedule of activities ,should not be delayed.  Once 
the toxicity has resolved to the required level, study treatment and study procedures 
will be resumed, according to the original study cycle day count ,i.e., every cycle 
contains exactly 28 days (other than Cycle 1 in Cohort 2, which contains 35days) .
For any concomitant conditions at baseline, dose modifications may apply according 
to the shift in toxicity grade, if the investigator deems it appropriate.  For example, if 
a patient has Grade 1 asthenia at baseline that increases to Grade 2 during 
treatment, this change may be considered a shift of one grade and may be treated 
as Grade 1 toxicity for dose -modification purposes , if medically appropriate .
For toxicities assessed by [CONTACT_294874] -threatening events, treatment may be 
continued at the same dose without reduction or interruption.
Dose reductions or i nterruptions may not be required for anemia (non -hemolytic) if 
satisfactorily managed by [CONTACT_27752].
Ifany observed toxicity is attributable to only one drug as assessed by [CONTACT_1275], the dose of the other drug(s) may not require modification.
Dose modifications for isolated abnormal hematologic laboratory values will be 
based on hematologic parameters at t he start of a treatment cycle.
Patients who require chemotherapy dose reductions and tolerate the reduced dose 
for more than 28 days may be all owed to increase back to a 100% dose at the 
treating physician's discretion (no specific guidance is provided for ipatasertib 
re-escalation, as it is not permitted).
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
121/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Chemotherapy may be interrupted to manage toxicity.  A dosing gap of up to 
4consecutive weeks (approximately 28 days) is permitted.  
Any dose hold for longer than 4 weeks for a treatment -related adverse event will requir e 
permanent discontinuation of the attributable treatment component and per specific 
adverse event management guidelines in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  As applicable, patients s hould 
continue treatment with remaining study drugs (after discussion with the Medical 
Monitor).
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion -Related Reactions to Paclitaxel 
Because of the known potential for allergic reactions to paclitaxel and/or the Cremophor
vehicle, precautions must be taken to decrease the risk of anaphylaxis per institutional 
guidelines.  
Patients should be monitored during paclitaxel administration per institutional policies.  
Patients may receive anti -emetic and other prophyla ctic treatments (e.g., IV infusions of 
calcium and magnesium to try to decrease any potential peripheral neuropathy) 
according to institutional and/or local standards and per manufacturer’s instructions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management Guidelines for A dverse Events
Guidelines for the management of patients who experience specific adverse events are 
provided in Appendix 13, Table 6 , and prescribing information , as outlined below:
Appendix 13provides guidelines for the management of patients who experience 
atezolizumab- associated IRRs and immune -mediated adverse events.  It is 
recommended that atezolizumab be withheld or discontin ued per the guidelines in
Appendix 13and that ipatasertib be withheld or discontinued per the guidelines in 
Table 6 .
Table 6 provides guidelines for the management of patients who experien ce the 
following potential overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_571785]:  
gastrointestinal, dermatologic, hepatic, pulmonary, and hyperglycemia events.  It is 
recommended that study treatments be withheld or discontinued per the guidelines 
in Table 6 .  For these potential overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685], guidelines in Table 6 should 
be followed instead of guidelines in Appendix 13.
Table 6 provides guidelines for the management of patients who experien ce 
adverse events associated with ipatasertib.  It is recommended that atezolizumab 
and/or ipatasertib be withheld or discontinued per the guidelines in Table 6 .
Guidelines for the management of patients who experience chemotherapy -related 
adverse events are found in the local prescribing information for each agent.
For cases in which management guidelines are not covered in Table [ADDRESS_750828] medical judgment.

Gastrointestinal 
toxicity
General guidance For all patients, dispense loperamide [ADDRESS_750829] cy cle.
After the first cycle, continue this dosing for the remainder of the study as clinically indicated.
Thoroughly evaluate all events of diarrhea or colitis for more common etiologies other than drug -induced 
effect s.
For diarrhea that persists for more than 5 days, despi[INVESTIGATOR_294784]-diarrheal agent(s) and/or with dose 
hold of ipatasertib, consult with gastroenterologists to rule out the risk of colitis and infection.  Educate patients 
on the sy mptoms and i mportance of early reporting of diarrhea and provide instructions for treatment and 
prevention of dehydration so that patients can be promptly and appropriately managed.  (Educational materials 
will be provided to investigators and patients outlining these guidelines.)
For events of significant duration or magnitude or associated with signs of sy stemic inflammation or acute 
phase reactants (e.g., increased CRP, platelet count, or bandemia), perform sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy, if 
appropriate) with colonic biopsy, with three to five specimens for standard paraffin block to check for 
inflammation and ly mphocytic infiltrates to confirm colitis diagnosis.
Administer anti -diarrheal agents and other supportive care per institutional guidelines or per suggested 
supportive care outlined below:
Medication
As early as possible, institute treatment modifications for diarrhea (any grade) when it occurs.  Guidelines for 
treatment of diarrhea, following the prophylactic dose of loperamide 4 mg initial daily dose, includ e use of 
loperamide 2 mg after each loose watery stool, up to the maximum total dose of 16 mg/day or per institutional 
guidelines and standard of care, including, but not limited to, additional therapy with Lomotil(diphenox ylate 
and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), codeine, o r octreotide.   Please note that loperamide prophylaxis alone is not sufficient if diarrhea 
occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_430903]; if diarrhea occurs while on loperamide prophylaxis, loperamide use should be 
increased as noted above, or additional medications added.

5.2.[ADDRESS_750843], regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not consider ed related to the medicinal product
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS]
and [IP_ADDRESS] for more information)
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at

5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)
This does not include any adverse event that ,had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue ,might have caused death.
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
139/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)
Is a congenit al anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study treatment
Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outco mes 
listed above)
The terms "severe "and "serious "are notsynonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event ( e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE; 
see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).
5.2.[ADDRESS_750844] (Immediately  Reportable

Adverse events of special interest are required to be rep orted by [CONTACT_33473] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions) even if they are not serious .  Adverse events of 
special interest for the study include the following:
Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s Law 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and based on the following observations:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin 2ULN, of which 35% is direct bilirubin
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with

Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_104841], as defined 
below:
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical s ymptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
when a contamination of study treatment is suspected.

SAFETY PARAMETERS
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] 5.6.
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ). 
5.3.[ADDRESS_750845].  All 
adverse events identified by [CONTACT_294877]’s medical 
record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, d iscontinuation of medications) should be reported 
(see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).
After initiation of study treatment , all adverse events will be reported until [ADDRESS_750846].
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event repor ting 
period are provided in Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning sh ould be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following:
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?" 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd

5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" 
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also 
Table 8 ):
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study treatment
Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study treatment , or reintroduction of study treatment (as 
applicable)
Known association of the event with the study treatment or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
143/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
Table 8Causal A ttribution Guidance
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES There is a plausi ble temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study treatment , and the adverse event cannot be readily 
explained by [CONTACT_102]'s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; 
and/or the advers e event follows a known pattern of response to the study treatment ; 
and/or the adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study treatment 
or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.
NO An adverse event will be cons idered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study treatment 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
orconcomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study treatment (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
firstdose of study treatment ).
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.
5.3.[ADDRESS_750848] medical terminology/concepts when r ecording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
There is one eCRF page for recording adverse events or serious adverse events.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study treatment administration 
and are judged to be related to study treatment i nfusion should be captured as 
adiagnosis (e.g., "infusion- related reaction") on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If p ossible, 
avoid ambiguous terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and symptoms 
should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF.  If a patient 
experiences both a local and systemic reaction to a single administration of study 
treatment, each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion- Related 
Reaction eCRF.

144/Protocol CO40151, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events That A reSecondary  to Other Events
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is se parated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the e CRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eC RF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  Details regarding any increases or decreases in severity of selected adverse 
events (e.g., diarrhea, Section 5.2.4 ) will be captured on the Adverse Event Intensity or 
Grade Changes eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became 
serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should 
be updated by [CONTACT_25748] "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
145/Protocol CO40151, Version 6that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse 
events.
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an advers e event should be recorded as 
aseparate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a c hange in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in t he investigator’s judgment 
Note:  For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse 
events.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with chole stasis ), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the A dverse Event eCRF, along with 
adescriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range 
(e.g., "elevated potassium, "as opposed to "abnormal potassium ").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia. "
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
146/Protocol CO40151, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adver se Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of a n elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as 
defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s Law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
2ULN
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in comb ination with clinical jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see
Section 5.4.2 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see
Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed by [CONTACT_571850].  All other deaths 
that occur during the adverse event reporting period, regardless of relationship to study 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
147/Protocol CO40151, Version 6drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the 
Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death late r becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should 
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].  The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
During surviva l follow -up, deaths attributed to progression of underlying breast cancer
should be recorded only on the Study Discontinuation eCRF.  Deaths that occur after the 
adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6).
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., "more frequent headaches ").
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of Breast Cancer
Events that are cl early consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of 
progression will be based o n RECIST v1.1.  In rare cases, the determination of clinical 
progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration.  However, every effort should 
be made to document progression through use of objective criteria.  If there is any 
uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression due to breast cancer , 
itshould be reported as an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26663] (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events A ssociated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not 
itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events 
associated with an overdose or inco rrect administration of study drug should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF , as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  If the 
associated adv erse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see
Section 5.4.2 ).
No safety data related to overdosing of ipatasertib or atezolizumab are available .
Paclitaxel overdosage does not have a known antidote.  Bone marrow suppression, 
peripheral neurotoxicity, and mucositis are the primary anticipated complications of 
overdosage of paclitaxel.
All doses must be documented in the patient diary and on the dosing administration 
eCRF for each study drug.  Any study drug overdose or incorrect administration of study 
drug should be noted o n the Study Drug Administration eCRF and reported as a protocol 
deviation.

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
149/Protocol CO40151, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Requirements for Cases of Overdose, Medication 
Error, Drug A buse, or Drug Misuse
Overdose (accidental or intentional), medication error, drug abuse, and drug misuse 
(herea fter collectively referred to as "special situations"), are defined as follows:
Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose
Intentional overdose:  intentional administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose
Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug 
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of 
the drug.
Drug abuse:  intentional excessive use of a dr ug that may lead to addiction or 
dependence, physical harm, and/or psychological harm
Drug misuse:  intentional deviation in the administration of a drug that does not 
qualify as drug abuse
In cases where drug is to be self -administered by [CONTACT_102], dru g misuse 
could involve the drug being administered to someone other than the patient.
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse 
events.  Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills 
seriousness criteria or qualifies as an adverse event of special interest , the event should 
be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24 hours after learning of t he 
event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  For ipatasertib, atezolizumab, paclitaxel/nab -paclitaxel, 
doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide , adverse events associated with special situations 
should be recorded as described below for each situation:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental 
overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Intentional overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Intentional 
overdose" box.  If drug abuse is suspected, check t he "Drug abuse" box.  If drug 
abuse is not suspected, check the "Drug misuse" box.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event 
term.  Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Ent er the adverse event term.  
Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Drug abuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Drug abuse" box.
Drug abuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adve rse event term.  Check the 
"Intentional overdose" and "Drug abuse" boxes.
Drug misuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Drug misuse" box.

150/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Drug misuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event ter m.  Check 
the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug misuse" boxes.
In addition, all special situations associated with ipatasertib, atezolizumab, 
paclitaxel/nab -paclitaxel , doxorubicin, or cyclophosphamide , regardless of whether they 
result in an adverse event , should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as described 
below:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Intentional overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intentional overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" box.  If drug abuse is suspected, check the 
"Drug abuse" box.  If drug abuse is not suspected, check the "Drug misuse" box.
Medication error that does not qualify as an ove rdose:  Enter the name [CONTACT_26865] a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expi[INVESTIGATOR_26669]) as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.
Interce pted medication error:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intercepted medication

boxes.
Drug misuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "drug 
misuse" as the event term.  Check the "Drug misuse" box.
Drug misuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intentional 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug misuse" 
boxes.
Drug administered to someone other than the patient:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 
"patient supplied drug to third party" as the event term.  Check the "Drug misuse" 
box.
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require two 
entries on the Adverse Event eCRF, one entry to report the accidental overdose and one 
entry to report the headache.  The "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes 
would need to be checked for both entrie s.
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
151/Protocol CO40151, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Left Ventricular Sy stolic Dy sfunction
Symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction should be reported as a serious 
adverse event.  If the diagnosis is heart failure, it should be reported as such and not in 
terms of the individual signs and symptom s thereof.  Heart failure should be graded 
according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0 and also according to the NYHA classification.  Heart 
failure occurring during the study and after the study (see Section 5.6) must be reported, 
irrespective of causal relationship, and followed until the event has resolved to baseline 
grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by [CONTACT_093], the patient is lost to 
follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.
Asymptomatic declines in LVEF should generally not be reported as adverse events 
because LVEF data are collected separately in the eCRF.  Exceptions to this rule are as 
follows:
Anasymptomati c decline in LVEF of10 percentage points from baseline to an 
LVEF of50% must be reported as an adverse event with the term "ejection 
fraction decreased" as per NCI CTCAE v4.0.
An asymptomatic decline in LVEF requiring treatment delay or leading to 
discontinuation of ipatasertib, atezolizumab, nab -paclitaxel, doxorubicin, or 
cyclophosphamide must be reported as an adverse event with the term "ejection 
fraction decreased," and, in addition, a comment in the adverse event comments 
field should confirm th at this event was asymptomatic .
5.[ADDRESS_750849] report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than [ADDRESS_750850] report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug:
Serious adverse events (defined in Section 5.2.2 ; see Section 5.4.2 for details on 
reporting requirements)
Adverse events of special interest (defined in Section 5.2.3 ; see Section 5.4.2 for 
details on reporting requirements)
Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for details on reporting requirements )
The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information).  New significant information incl udes the following:
New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis
Significant new diagnostic test results
Change in causality based on new information

of cyclophosphamide, whichever occurs later.  A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy 
Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of t he pregnancy), either by 
[CONTACT_294880].  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel t he patient, 
discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring 
of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse 
events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, a n event in the mother 
during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be 
reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical 
Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated informat ion on the course and outcome 
of the pregnancy becomes available.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients

[IP_ADDRESS] Abortions
A spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor 
considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event, 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  A therapeutic or 
elective abortion performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.
All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form.
[IP_ADDRESS] Congenital A nomalies /Birth Defects
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study 
treatment should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse

There is no formal hypothesis testing planned. Cohort 1, Cohort 2 , Cohort 3 , and 
Cohort 4 may be analyzed separately. Patients with PD -L1positive tumors receiving 
IpatAtezo PacinCohort 1 will be pooled with patients inCohort 4 for analyses.
6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
There is no formal hypothesis testing planned. The determination of sample size for 
each cohort is described below.
6.1.1 Cohort s 1and 3 : Safety  Run -In Stage
In Cohorts 1 and 3, the number of patients enrolled during the safety run -in stage (n 6) 
in each arm (i.e.,A1, B1, C1, D1 , F1, and G1 ) allows for a reasonable likelihood of 
observing a given adverse event in at least 1 patient even when the incidence of the 
specific adverse event is low (see Table 9 ).

6.1.2 Cohort 1: Expansion Stage
No formal statistical hypothesis testing is planned in this study. Instead, the analysis 
here is for hypothesis generation ,and the emphasis is on estimations. To evaluate the 
primary endpoint of overall response rate for Cohort 1, for each arm, the analyses will be 
based on combining patients enrolled in the safety run -in and expansion stages, which is 
approximately 20 patients (Cohort 1, Arms A and B) or 12 patients (Cohort 1, Arms C 
and D). Table 10shows estimated ORR and its 95% CI based on the Clopper Pearson 
method given various observed numbers of responders among the 20 patients in Arms A 
and B ,respectively .Twenty patients provide reasonably reliable estimates for

6.1.3 Cohort 2: Biopsy
If there is sufficient evidence of meaningful benefit from the combination of ipatasertib 
and atezolizumab with taxane in Cohort 1 , (e.g.,ORR 50%), the Sponsor may decide 
to open enrollment of a separate mandatory on -treatment biopsy c ohort to evaluate 
biomarker endpoints of patients treated with ipatasertib combined with atezolizumab to 
further understand the molecular basis of treatment benefit. To provide a reliable 
estimate of the effects of ipatasertib and ipatasertib atezolizum ab on immune cell 
infiltration and activation, as well as molecular tumor biomarkers and circulating immune 
cell repertoires, a total of up to 14 patients will be enrolled in this cohort for exploratory 
analyses .
6.1.4 Cohort 3:  Expansion Stage
No formal statistical hypothesis testing is planned in this study.  Instead, the analysis 
here is for hypothesis generation, and the emphasis is on estimations.  To evaluate the 
primary efficacy endpoint of pCR for Cohort 3, for each arm, the analyses will be based 
on combining patients enrolled in the safety run -in stage (n6) and expansion stage
(n6 or 12, as determined by [CONTACT_1034]) for a to tal of either 12 patients or 18 patients .

Clopper Pearson method given various observed numbers of responders among 
12patients or 18 patients, respectively ,in Arm F orArm G.  The minimum sample size, 
12patients ,will provide reasonably reliable estimates for hypothesis generation in the 
expansion stage in Arms F and G.   Any addit ional patients will strengthen the evidence 
by [CONTACT_571854].

present the category counts a s frequencies and percentages.
6.4 EFFICA CY ANAL YSES FOR COHORT 1 AND COHORT 4
All efficacy analyses, except for duration of response (DOR) , will be based on efficacy 
evaluable patient population, which is defined as all enrolled patients who received at 
least one dose of study treatment , regardless of treatment allocation .DOR analysis will 
include all patients with an objective response (i.e.,a confirmed complete response or 
partial response) . Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they recei ve. 
The treatment arms for Cohort 1 efficacy analys es are as follows :
Arm A :  Ipat Atezo Pac
Arm B :  Ipat Atezo Nab-Pac
Arm C :  Ipat Pac alone for 2 weeks, thenAtezo
Arm D :  Atezo Pac alone for 2 weeks, thenIpat
Arm A and B combined: IpatAtezo taxane
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
162/Protocol CO40151, Version 6For Cohort 4, efficacy analyses will be carried out on the pooled data from 
PD-L1positive patients in Arms A, B, and H (ipatasertib atezolizumab paclitaxel) .
All primary and secondary endpoints based on tumor burden will be based on 
radiological (or photographical, if applicable) assessments by [CONTACT_294883].
6.4.1 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint
[IP_ADDRESS] Objective Response Rate
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed complete response o r 
partial res ponse on two consecutive occasions [ADDRESS_750863] v1.1 ( see Appendix 10).  Patients without a 
postb aseline tumor assessment will be considered as non -responders.  ORR is defined 
as the proportion of patients who have an objective response; an estimate of ORR will 
be calculated for each treatment arm , and its 95% CI will be calculated using the 
Clopper Pearson method. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of Response
DOR will be analyzed to support ORR. DOR is defined as the time from the first 
occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression, as determined 
by [CONTACT_3143] v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever 
occurs first.  Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be 
censored at the last disease assessment date.
6.4.2 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression -Free Survival 
PFS isdefined as the time from enrollment to the date of the first recorded occurrence of 
disease progression, as determined by [CONTACT_26309] v1.1 (see 
Appendix 10), or death from any cause, whichev er occurs first.  Data for patients who do 
not experience disease progression or death will be censored at the last date of 
evaluable tumor assessment.  For patients who do not have an evaluable tumor 
assessment after receiving first treatment, the data wi ll be censored at the date of first 
treatment plus 1 day.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Benefit Rate
Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of patients who have an objective 
response ( complete or partial ), or stable disease for at least [ADDRESS_750864] v1.1.  For each arm, clinical benefit rate will be 
analyzed using methods similar to those used for ORR.
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall Survival
OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause.  Data for patients 
who are not reported as having died at the time of analysis will be censored at the date 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
163/Protocol CO40151, Version 6when they were last known to be alive.  Data for patients who do not have postb aseline 
information will be censored at the first treatment date plus 1 day.  
6.4.3 Exploratory  Efficacy  Endpoints
The potential relationship between the presence of PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN genetic 
alterations in tumors and anti -tumor activity (including ORR, DOR, PFS , CBR , and OS ) 
of ipatasertib in com bination with atezolizumab and paclitaxel or nab -paclitaxel in Cohort 
[ADDRESS_750865] one dose study treatment , 
regardless of treatment allocation.
The primary effic acy objective for Cohort 3 is to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant 
IpatAtezo AC (ipatasertib dose of 300 mg) followed by [CONTACT_571796] Atezo Pac (ipatasertib 
dose of 400 mg)(Arm F) or neoadjuvant IpatAtezo AC (ipatasertib dose of 400 mg) 
followed by [CONTACT_571796] Atezo Pac (ipatasertib dose of 400 mg) (Arm G) in p atients with 
locally advanced T2[ADDRESS_750866] and noresidual disease in 
the lymph nodes (ypT0/ Tis ypN0).  The primary efficacy endpoint will be established 
following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.
In the primary analysis, patients whose pCR assessment is missing will be counted as 
not achie ving a pCR.  An estimate of the pCR rate and its 95% CI will be calculated for 
each treatment arm through use of the Clopper Pearson method (Clopper and Pearson 
1934).  
6.7 SAFETY ANAL YSES
All safety analyses will be based on the safety -evaluable population f or each cohort 
(i.e.,all patients who received any study treatment) according to the treatment received.
Safety analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_571856] , nature, and 
severity of treatment -emergent adverse events, including adverse events leading to 
death, serious adverse events, and adverse events of special interest.  All deaths will be 
summarized.  In addition, adverse events leading to study treatment discontinuation and 
dose modification will be summarized.  Laboratory measure ments outside of the normal 
range will be identified.  Selected laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_571857] —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
164/Protocol CO40151, Version 6and grade compared with baseline.  Relevant vital signs will be presented using 
summary statistics by [CONTACT_31703].  Drug exposur e will be summarized as 
well, including duration of treatment, cumulative dose, and dose intensity. 
Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as adverse events that occur after the 
first dose of study treatment.  Adverse events will be summarized by m apped MedDRA 
preferred terms and appropriate MedDRA hierarchy.  Adverse event severity will be 
graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.  Multiple occurrences of the same event will be 
counted once at the maximum severity.
6.8 PHA RMA COKINETIC A NALYSES
Sparse or inte nsive samples will be collected for PK analyses of atezolizumab (patients 
who receive at least one dose of atezolizumab) and ipatasertib and its metabolite 
G-037720 (patients who receive at least one dose of the respective drug) as described 
in Appendix 4, Appendix 5, and Appendix 6.  Serum or plasma concentrations of the 
various study drugs and PK markers ( coproporphyrin I and III ) will be summarized 
(mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation) by [CONTACT_2939], and by [CONTACT_571858].  Individual and median serum or plasma 
concentrations of the various study drugs will be plotted by [CONTACT_571859].  Non -compartmental analysis will be conducted when the data allow for it (e.g.,
during the intensive sampling ). Analyte concentration data for ipatasertib (and its 
metabolite, G -037220) and atezolizumab may be pooled with data from other st udies 
using an established pop PK model to derive PK parameters such as clearance, volume 
of distribution, and area under the curve as appropriate to assist in comparison with 
historical data .Covariates such as patient demographics ( e.g., age, se x, body size), 
total protein, serum albumin, liver function tests ( e.g., AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase), 
and serum creatinine may be tested for significance on PK parameters of interest, if data 
allow.
The PK data will be analyzed with the safety and/or efficacy ( e.g., PFS) data for 
exposure response mod eling as data permit.  PK and pharmacodynamic analyses may 
be reported in separate standalone reports.  
Additional PK analyses will be conducted as appropriate.
6.[ADDRESS_750867] one anti -drug antibody (ADA) assessment.  Patients will 
be grouped according to treatment received or, if no treatment is received prior to study 
disconti nuation, according to treatment assigned.
For atezolizumab, the numbers and proportions of ADA -positive patients and 
ADA-negative patients at baseline (baseline prevalence) and after baseline 
(postbaseline incidence) will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. When determining 

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
165/Protocol CO40151, Version 6postbaseline incidence, patients are considered to be ADA positive if they are ADA 
negative or are missing data at baseline but develop an ADA response following study 
drug exposure (treatment -induced ADA response), or if they are ADA pos itive at 
baseline and the titer of one or more postbaseline samples is at least 0.60 titer unit 
greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment -enhanced ADA response).  
Patients are considered to be ADA negative if they are ADA negative or have mi ssing 
data at baseline and all postbaseline samples are negative, or if they are ADA positive at 
baseline but do not have any postbaseline samples with a titer that is at least 0.60 titer 
unit greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment unaffe cted).
The relationship between ADA status and safety, efficacy, PK, and biomarker endpoints 
may be analyzed and reported via descriptive statistics.
6.[ADDRESS_750868] intrinsic subtypes , genetic alterations, and expression of tumor suppressors, will 
be evaluated for their association with drug response.
Additionally, f or patients in C ohort s 2and 3 ,tumor, plasma, and blood samples will be 
evaluated for changes i n immune cell infiltration and activation as well as molecular 
tumor biomarkers and circulating immune cell repertoires, from ipatasertib and 
ipatasertib atezolizumab treatment.  These analyses will be done using appropriate 
statistical methods.
For Coho rt 3, pCR analys es similar to thatdescribed in Section 6.6will be run in the 
subgroup of patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN genetic alterations and/or subgroups of 
patients by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 status .

7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCU MENTA TION
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to confirm that 
critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_77038], complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PROs, evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_70069], 
microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient fil es, 
and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical departments 
involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This inc ludes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5.

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
167/Protocol CO40151, Version 6To facilitat e source data verification and review, the investigators and institutions must 
provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for 
trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also 
allow ins pection by [CONTACT_25756] .
7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
as th e source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An 
acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry 
of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail 
that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_33508], and date of the change.
7.[ADDRESS_750871] to local regulations.  
No records may be dispo sed of without the written approval of the Sponsor .  Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to 
another party or moving them to another location.
The Sponsor will retain study data for 25 years after the final Clinical Study Report has 
been completed or for the length of time required by [CONTACT_109851], whichever is longer.

data.
9.[ADDRESS_750875] on patient safety and 
data integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC 
policies and procedures.  The Sponsor wil l review all protocol deviations and assess 
whether any represent a serious breach of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and require 
reporting to health authorities.  As per the Sponsor's standard operating procedures, 
prospective requests to deviate from t he protocol, including requests to waive protocol 
eligibility criteria, are not allowed.
9.3 MANAGEMENT OF STUDY QUALITY
The Sponsor has implemented a system to manage the quality of the study, focusing on 
processes and data that are essential to ensuring pati ent safety and data integrity.  
Prior to study initiation, the Sponsor identified potential risks associated with critical 
trial processes and data and implemented plans for evaluating and controlling these 
risks.  Risk evaluation and control included the selection of risk -based parameters 
(e.g., adverse event rate, protocol deviation rate) and the establishment of quality 
tolerance limits for these parameters prior to study initiation.  Detection of deviations 
from quality tolerance limits will trigger an evaluation to determine if action is needed.  

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
171/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Details on the establishment and monitoring of quality to lerance limits areprovided in 
aQuality Tolerance Limit Management Plan.
9.4 SITE INSPECTIONS
Site visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_26833], patients' medical records, and eCRFs.  The investigator will 
permit national and local health authorities; Sponsor monitors, representatives, and 
collaborators; and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.
9.5 ADMINISTRA TIVE STRUC TURE
This trial will be sponsored and managed by F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd.  The Sponsor 
will provide clinical operations management, data management, and medical monitoring.
Up to 25sites in the [LOCATION_002], S pain, [LOCATION_009], the [LOCATION_008], and Australia
will participate to enroll approximately 202patients.  Sequential enrollment into Arms A1, 
B1,A2, and B2 will be employed.  To further explore tolerability of the triplet 
combination, additional arms ( Arms C and D),with stepwise introduction of the treatment 
drugs ,will be opened .  Sequen tial enrollment order in Cohort 1 will then be as follows:  
A1 B1 A2 B2/C1 D1 C2 D2.  Both Arms B2 and Arms C or D can be 
open simultaneously, but priority for filling of arms will go to Arms C and D.  To further 
investigate the tolerability and efficacy of the triplet combination regime used in Arm A in 
first-line metastatic TNBC, Arm A will be further extended to include another expansion 
phase (Stage 3,Arm A3). Arm A3 will open after Arms C2 and D2 have been filled.
Enrollment into the biopsy cohort (Cohort 2) will be gated by [CONTACT_571861] 3.1.6 .Toexplore tolerability of the triplet combination in the locally 
advanced TNBC setting, Cohort 3,with two additional arms (Arms F and G), will be 
opened.  Enrollment order in Cohort 3 will be as follows:  F1 G1 F2and/or G2.
Cohort 4 will further evaluate the triplet combination of Ipat Atezo Pac in patients with 
PD-L1positive tumors .
Central facilities will be used for certain study assessments throughout the study 
(e.g., specified laboratory tests, biomarker and PK analyses), as specified in Section 4.5.  
Accredited local laboratories will be used for routine monitoring; local laboratory ranges 
will be collected.
The Study Medical M onitor and the Study Team (see Internal Safety Monitoring, 
Section 3.1.11) will monitor and evaluate patient safety throughout the study.

follow -up visit may be scheduled (even after the treatment discontinuation visit ); follow -up by  [CONTACT_571862].
bbSee Appendix 5for schedule of PK assessments.
ccPlasma sample collection to measure coproporphyrin I and III concentrations only.
ddDiscontinuation sample of PK and ADA must be within [ADDRESS_750916] dose.
eeTumor biopsy collection is optional for study participation .  For patients who sign an Optional Research Biosample Repository Informed Consent 
Form ,and if tumor biopsies can be obtained with minimal risk and discomfort to the patient, a tumor biopsy would be at the time of progression 
within 6 weeks of the progression assessment and prior to initiation of a new anti- cancer therapy ; tumor biopsy  of the growing lesion is preferred .
ffAfter treatment discontinuation, information on survival follow -up and new anti -cancer therapy (including targeted therapy and immunotherapy) 
will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or clinic vi sits approximately every 3 months until death (unless the patient 
withdraws consent or the Sponsor terminates the study).  If a patient requests to be withdrawn from follow -up, this request must be documented 
in the source documents and signed by [CONTACT_8647].  If the patient withdraws from the study, the study staff may  use a public information 
source (e.g., county records) to obtain information about survival status only.

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST):  
Modified Excerpt from Original Publication
Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 
Version 1.11are presented below, with slight modifications and the addition of 
explanatory text as needed for clarity.2
Measurability  of Tumor at Baseline
Definitions
At baseline, tumor lesions/ly mph nodes will be categorized as measurable 
or non -measurable as described below.
a.Measurable Tumor Lesions
Tumor Lesions.   Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorde d) with a minimum size 
asfollows: 
10mm by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan 
(CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval no greater than 5 mm)
10-mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_12148] (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable)
[ADDRESS_750934] be 15mmin the short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and follow up, 
only the short axis will be measured and followed.  See also notes below on 
“Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions” for information on 
lymph node measurement.
b.Non- Measurable Tumor Lesions
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter 10mmor 
pathological lymph nodes with short axis 10 but 15mm), as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal

c.Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment, as outlined below.
Bone Lesions:
Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not 
considered adequate imaging techniques for me asuring bone lesions.  However, 
these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of 
bone lesions.
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic –blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components , that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional ima ging techniques such as 
CTor MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component 
meets the definition of measurability described above.
Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.
Cystic Lesions:
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable l esions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  
However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:
Tumor lesions situated in a pre viously irradiated area or in an area subjected to 
other loco -regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has

conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable.

a.Measurement of Lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, with use of calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be perfor med as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.

214/Protocol CO40151, Version 6b.Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study.  
Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option.
Clinical Lesions.   Clinical lesions will be considered measurable only when they are 
superficial and 10mmin diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  
Forthe case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion is suggested.
Chest X -Ray.   Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is 
an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying 
new lesions.  However, lesions on a chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].
CT, MRI.   CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions 
on CT scan on the basis of the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_750935] or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the patient at 
baseline and during the study should be guided by [CONTACT_77056].  For patients who develop contraindications to 
contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non -contrast CT 
or MRI (enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed should also be based on the 
tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease and should be optimized to allow for 
comparison with the prior studies if possible.  Each case should be discussed with the 
radiologist to determine whether substitution of these other approaches is possible and, 
ifnot, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward .  Care must 
be taken in measurement of target lesions on a different modality and interpretation of 
non-target disease or new lesions since the same lesion may appear to have a different 
size using a new modality.
Ultrasound.   Ultrasound is not useful in asse ssment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement.

Tumor Response Evaluation
Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the 
overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent 
measurements.  Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_33489], as detailed above.
Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to 
amaximum of five lesions total (and a maxi mum of two lesions per organ) representative 
of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and 
measured at baseline.  This means that, for instances in which patients have only one or 
two organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions 
(two sites), respectively, will be recorded.  Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those 
organs will be recorded as non- measurable lesions (even if the size is 10mmby 
[CONTACT_70182]).  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, but in addition, should lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, 
onoccasion, the largest lesion d oes not lend itself to reproducible measurement, 
inwhich circumstance, the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly 
should be selected.
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
thatmay be visible by [CONTACT_571865].  As noted above, 
pathological nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target 
lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 15mmby [CONTACT_3610].  Only the short 
axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  The short axis of the node is the 
diameter normally used by [CONTACT_48861] a node is involved by [CONTACT_70188].  
Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is 
obtained (for CT, this is al most always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane of acquisition 
may be axial, sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  
Forexample, an abdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm30mmhas 
ashort axis of 20 mmand qual ifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 
20mmshould be recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes 
Appendix 10
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST):  
Modified Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
216/Protocol CO40151, Version 6(those with short axis 10mmbut 15mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  
Nodes that have a short axis of 10mmare considered non- pathological and should not 
be recorded or followed.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions wil l be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  Iflymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, then, as noted above, only the short axis is added 
into the sum.  The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further 
characteriz e any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be 
identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements 
are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present,” “absent,” or in rare 
cases, “unequivocal progression.”
In addition, it is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the same organ 
as a single item on the Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g., “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”).
Response Criteria
a.Evaluation of Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target lesions.
Complete response (CR):  disappearance of all target lesions
–Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have 
reduction in short axis to 10mm.
Partial response (PR):  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters
Progressive disease (PD):  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline
–In addition to the relative i ncrease of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
–The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.
Stable disease (SD):  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to q ualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
217/Protocol CO40151, Version 6b.Special Notes on the A ssessment of Target Lesions
Lymph Nodes.   Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the 
baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to 10mmon study.  This means that 
when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of lesions may not be zero 
even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymp h node is defined as 
having a short axis of 10mm.
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.   During the study, all lesions 
(nodal and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation, ev en when very small (e.g., 2mm).  However, 
sometimes lesions or lymph nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an 
exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  W hen this occurs, it 
is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows:
Ifit is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], 
themeasurement should be recorded as 0 mm.
Ifthe lesion is believed to b e present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, 
adefault value of 5 mm should be assigned and below measurable limit (BML) 
should be ticked.  (Note:  It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes 
since they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded 
by [CONTACT_12156]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm 
should be assigned in this circumstance as well and BML should also be ticked.)
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, even if it is below [ADDRESS_750936] diameter for the coalesced lesion.
c.Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response 
for the group of non -target lesions.  Although some non -target lesions may actually be

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST):  
Modified Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
218/Protocol CO40151, Version 6measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only 
qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol.
CR:  disappearance of all non -target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of 
tumor marker level
–All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size ( 10mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD:  persistence of one or more non- target lesions and/or 
(ifapplicable) maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits
PD:  unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions
–The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.
d.Special Notes on A ssessment of Progression of Non -Target Disease
When the Patient A lso Has Measurable Disease.   In this setting, to achieve 
unequivocal progression on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall 
level of substantial worsening in non -target disease in a magnitude that, even in the 
presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or 
more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression 
status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in 
non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely 
rare.
When the Patient Has Only  Non -Measurable Disease.   This circumstance arises in 
some Phase III trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease.  
The same general concepts apply here as noted above; however, in this instance there
is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in 
non-measurable disease burden.  Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be 
easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]:  if all lesions are truly non- measurable), a useful test that 
can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the 
increase in overall disease burden on the basis of the change in non -measurable 
disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare 
PD for measurable disease; that is, an increase in tumor burden representing an 
additional 73% increase in volume (which isequivalent to a 20% increase in diameter in 
a measurable lesion).  Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to 
“large” or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread or may be 
described in protocols as “sufficient to require a change in therapy.”  Ifunequivocal 
progression is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overal l PD at that 
point.  Although it would be ideal to have objective criteria apply to non -measurable 
Appendix 10
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST):  
Modified Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
219/Protocol CO40151, Version 6disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore, the 
increase must be substantial.
e.New Lesions
The appearance of new mali gnant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for 
the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, 
change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor 
(forexample, some “new” bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting 
lesions).  This is par ticularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or 
complete response.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT 
scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified during the study in an an atomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression .
Ifa new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  Ifrepeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan.
Evaluation of Response
a.Time Point Response (Overall Respons e)
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified time point, a response assessment occurs.  
Table [ADDRESS_750937] non- measurable (therefore non -target) disease only, Table 2 is to 
be used.

a“Non -CR/non -PD” is preferred over “stable disease” for non -target disease since stable 
disease is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy  in some trials; thus, 
assigning “stable disease” when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
b.Missing A ssessments and Not -Evaluable Designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at al l at a particular time point, the patient is not 
evaluable at that time point.  Ifonly a subset of lesion measurements is made at an 
assessment, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that time point unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing 
lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point response.  This would be most likely 
to happen in the case of PD.  For example, if a patient had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_750938] achieved PD status, regardless of the 
contribution of the missing lesion.

221/Protocol CO40151, Version 6Ifone or more target lesions were not assessed either because the scan was not do ne 
orthe scan could not be assessed because of poor image quality or obstructed view, 
theresponse for target lesions should be “unable to assess” since the patient is not 
evaluable.  Similarly, if one or more non -target lesions are not assessed, the response 
for non -target lesions should be “unable to assess” except where there is clear 
progression.  Overall response would be “unable to assess,” if either the target response 
or the non -target response is “unable to assess” except where this is clear evidence of 
progression, as this equates with the case being not evaluable at that time point.

aIfa CR is truly met at the first time point, any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even 
disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, qualifies as PD at that point (since disease 
must have reappeared after CR).  Best response would depend on whether the minimum 
duration for SD was met.  However, sometimes CR may be claimed when subsequent scans 
suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR, at the 
first time point.  Under these circumsta nces, the original CR should be changed to PR and 
the best response is PR.

222/Protocol CO40151, Version 6c.Special Notes on Response A ssessment
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
“normal” size ( 10mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted 
earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the CRF.
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a 
descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  The 
objective response status of such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_70186]- target disease as shown in Tables 1 –3.
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; 
cystic changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next 
scheduled assessment.  Ifat the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, 
the date of progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.
In studies for which patients with advanced disease are eligible ( i.e.,primary disease still 
or partially present), the primary tumor should also be captured as a target or non -target 
lesion, as appropriate.  This is to avoid an incorrect assessment of complete response if 
the primar y tumor is still present but not evaluated as a target or non- target lesion.

231/Protocol CO40151, Version 6IMMUNE -MEDI ATED MYOC ARDITIS
Immune -mediated myocarditis has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Immune -mediated myocarditis should be suspected in any patient 
presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, including, but not limited 
to, laboratory (e.g., B -type natriuretic peptide) or cardiac imaging abnormalities, 
dyspnea, chest pain, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], fa tigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or syncope.  
Immune -mediated myocarditis needs to be distinguished from myocarditis resulting from 
infection (commonly viral, e.g., in a patient who reports a recent history of 
gastrointestinal illness), ischemic events , underlying arrhythmias, exacerbation of 
preexisting cardiac conditions, or progression of malignancy.  
All patients with possible myocarditis should be urgently evaluated by [CONTACT_33500], an ECG, a chest X -ray, an echocardiogram, and a cardiac MRI as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines.  A cardiologist should be consulted.  An 
endomyocardial biopsy may be considered to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment, if clinically indicated.
Patients with signs and sy mptoms of myocarditis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 3 below .

233/Protocol CO40151, Version 6INFUSION -RELA TED REA CTIONS AND CYTOKINE -RELEASE
SYNDROME
No premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of atezolizumab.  
However, patients who experience an infusion -related reaction (IRR) or cytokine -release 
syndrome (CRS) with atezolizumab may receive premedication with antihistamines ,
anti-pyretics , and/ oranalgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions.  
Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited in treating atezolizumab -associated IRRs because of 
its potential for causing agranulocytosis.
IRRs are known to occur wit h the administration of monoclonal antibodies and have 
been reported with atezolizumab.  These reactions, which are thought to be due to 
release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators, occur within 24 hours of 
atezolizumab administration and are gene rally mild to moderate in severity.
CRS is defined as a supraphysiologic response following administration of any immune 
therapy that results in activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T-cells
and/or other immune effector cells.  Symptoms can be progressive, always include fever 
at the onset, and may include hypotension, capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946] (hypoxia), and end -organ 
dysfunction (Lee et al. 2019).  CRS has been well documented with chimeric antigen 
receptor T- celltherapi[INVESTIGATOR_70074] T- cell engager antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_70075] -1 or PD -L1(Rotz et al. 2017; 
Adashek and Feldman 2019), including atezolizumab.
There may be significant overlap in signs and symptoms of IRRs and CRS, and in 
recognition of the challenges in clinically distinguishing between the two, consolidated 
guidelines for medical management of IRRs and CRS are provided in Table 4.
Severe COVID -19 appears to be associated with a CRS involving the inflammatory 
cytokines interleukin (IL) -6, IL -10, IL -2, and IFN -(Merad and Martin 2020).  If 
apatient develops suspected CRS during the study, a differential diagnosis should 
include COVID -19, which should be confirmed or refuted through assessment of 
exposure history, appropriate laboratory testing, and clinical or radiologic evaluations 
per investigator judgment.  If a diagnosis of COVID -19is confirmed, the disease sh ould 
be managed as per local or institutional guidelines.
Guidelines for medical management of IRRs during Cycle 1 are provided in Table 4
below .  For subsequent cycles, IRRs should be managed according to institutional 
guidelines.

NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS
Myasthenia gravis and Guillain -Barré syndrome have been observed with single -agent 
atezolizumab.  Patients may present with signs and symptoms of sensory and/or motor 
neuropathy.  Diagnostic work -up is essential for an accurate characterization to 
differentiate between alternative etiologies.  Management guidelines for neurologic 
disorders are provided in Table 7below.

IMMUNE -MEDI ATEDMENINGOENCEPHALITIS
Immune -mediated meningoencephalitis is an identified risk associated with the 
administration of atezolizumab.  Immune -mediated meningoencephalitis should be 
suspected in any patient presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or 
encephalitis, including, but not limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seiz ure, motor 
or sensory dysfunction, and altered or depressed level of consciousness.

potential meningoencephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or 
progression of malignancy, or secondary to a paraneoplastic process.  
All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with 
a CT scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation, or 
edema.  I f deemed safe by [CONTACT_1963], a lumbar puncture should be 
performed and a neurologist should be consulted.

RENA L EVENTS
Immune -mediated nephritis has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Eligible patients must have adequate renal function .  Renal function, 
including serum creatinine, should be monitored throughout study treatment.  Patients 
with abnormal renal function should be evaluated and treated for other more common 
etiologies (including prerenal and postrenal causes, and concomitant medications such 
as non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs).  Refer the patient to a renal specialist if 
clinically indicated.  A renal biopsy may be re quired to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment.

Effect of N-[ADDRESS_976633] of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   SPONSOR University of Minnesota   PRINCIPLE INVESTIGATOR Timothy Schacker, MD FUNDING ORGANIZATION NIAID: NIH 5UM1AI126611 NUMBER OF SITES University of Minnesota Hennepin Healthcare   RATIONALE HIV-specific CD8+ T cells are the primary mechanism by [CONTACT_716625]. CD8+ T cells and other effector cells, including NK cells, are excluded from B-cell follicles. As a consequence, HIV replicates at higher titers in the follicles. This reservoir for the virus and may prove to be difficult to target with immune-based curative interventions but therapi[INVESTIGATOR_716599] (i.e., CD8+ T cells or NK cells) to access this reservoir will likely be needed for many of the emerging curative approaches. The interleukin-15 (IL-15) superagonist N-803 (previously ALT-803) induces the expression of CXCR5 on CD8+ T cells, allowing them to access to B cell follicles. In a recent study by [CONTACT_716626], N-803 administration to SIV infected macaques was associated with increased frequency of SIV specific CD8 T cells in B cell follicles in spatial proximity to SIV infected T follicular helper (TFh) cells.  In an ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_976634] thus far found in peripheral blood: 1. There is activation and proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells and NK cells. 2. HIV transcription is induced at all doses tested. 3. There was a significant reduction in the frequency of cells with an inducible provirus after [ADDRESS_976635] dose that will include an excisional biopsy of a lymph node, colonic biopsies, and leukapheresis. Participants will then receive three doses of N-803 administered every 21 days. A second excisional biopsy will be performed between 7-14 days after the final dose. The study drug N-803 will be administered at 6 mcg/kg, which is the maximum tolerated dose determined in a recently completed dose-escalation study.   PRIMARY OBJECTIVE • To determine the impact of N-803 on the frequency and function of CD8+ T cells in B cell follicles. • To determine the safety of N-803 HIV+ ART suppressed individuals by [CONTACT_716627]. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES • To determine the impact of IL-15 on the frequency, location, and phenotype of vRNA+ and vDNA+ cells in lymphoid tissues.   EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES         • To determine the effect of N-[ADDRESS_976636] HIV genomes • To determine the effect of N-803 on frequency and activation status of NK cells in tissue and blood • Impact of N-803 on Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in tissues and blood. • Impact of N-803 on HIV specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) in tissues and blood. • Impact of N-[ADDRESS_976637] of the study. The role of the B cell follicle as a potential sanctuary for HIV replication and persistence has been demonstrated in untreated SIV-infected macaques, particularly those with low-level viremia (“elite” controllers).

Effect of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   
Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  18 1. INTRODUCTION / BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 1.1. Overview N-803 (formally ALT-803) is an IL-[ADDRESS_976645] (IL-15/IL-15Ra-Fc) that is in clinical trials for hematologic and other malignancies. It is a potential candidate for HIV reservoir reduction studies as it can activate CD4 T cells, reactivating virus from latency, but also expand and activate CD8 and NK cells providing an increased pool of potential effector cells. Important to this proposal it also has been shown in at least one model of a non-human primate model of SIV infection to increase the frequency of SIV specific CD8 T cells in B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues (LT). N-[ADDRESS_976646]. Schacker as the PI. This trial in individuals who are HIV-infected was a dose-escalation trial to establish the safety and tolerability of the drug in this population. There are 3 formulations of IL-15 that are in clinical trials for treatment of various solid and hematologic malignancies (Fig 1). The first is a formulation from NCI that is just the IL-[ADDRESS_976647] is the ImmunityBio., Inc. molecule that is an IL-15/IL-15Ra-Fc superagonist complex that contains a mutation that increases avidity of the molecule for IL-2Rbg on NK cells and also includes the IgG1Fc domain (1-3). These modifications in N-803 increase the half-life and stability of the drug and also provide better penetration of the drug into lymphatic tissues (LT) (4) where > 99% of the virus reservoir resides (5). All of the data presented here were generated using N-803.  N-[ADDRESS_976648] doses studied, N-803 can induce HIV transcription. Secondly, N-803 is associated with increased frequency of activated NK and CD8 cells (6) to clear virus infected cells. In addition, in the non-human primate model (NHP) of SIV infection, N-803 is associated with an increased frequency of SIV-specific CD8-T cells in B cell follicles where virus infected TFh reside(7). Thus, we have identified a single intervention with potential to both induce virus from latency and to clear clear virus infected cells. In this study, we focus on the effect of N-[ADDRESS_976649] completed an IRB and FDA approved Phase 1 clinical trial (IND 125191) to determine the safety and tolerability of N-[ADDRESS_976650]. Schacker was the Principal Investigator. The study was a dose-escalation trial to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of N-803 in HIV infected ART suppressed individuals. Two individuals were studied at 0.3 mcg/kg. A total of [ADDRESS_976651] dose level: 1, 3, and 6 mcg/kg. The protocol design allowed an increase to 10 mcg/kg as the final dose tested however the study was concluded after the 6 mcg/kg dose cohort because of the increased frequency of myalgia’s and other flu-like symptoms at the higher doses tested.  The protocol was initially designed for drug to be administered intravenously however while we were completing the 0.3 mcg/kg dose level it was learned that subcutaneous (SQ) administration of N-803 provided better penetration into lymph nodes and was  Fig 1: IL-[ADDRESS_976652] of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   
Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  19 associated with fewer systemic symptoms of fever, myalgia. The 1, 3, and 6 mcg/kg doses of N-[ADDRESS_976653]. Karn of Case Western Reserve University, a co-investigator on these studies, has recently developed a novel Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based protocol, called EDITS (Envelope Detection by [CONTACT_654075]-based Sequencing), to measure inducible cell-associated HIV RNA (8). Sequences of envelope are detected using a nested PCR on 1.25 x106 resting memory cells from aviremic HIV-1-infected participants before and after ConA stimulation. Samples from different patients are bar-coded, pooled, and sequenced simultaneously which saves both time and sequencing costs, and allows accurate comparisons since input cDNA levels are effectively normalized. All EDITS experiments include control reactions set up without the addition of reverse transcriptase, as well as no template controls. In addition, this assay is quantitative because latently infected cells carry, on average, only one provirus (9) and therefore the frequency of inducible RNAs is proportional to the numbers of inducible cells in each of the wells. Comparing the reads obtained in the EDITS assay after maximal activation of cells by [CONTACT_716630] a standard curve obtained by [CONTACT_716631] (Fig 2), provides an accurate measurement of the number of latently infected cells in any patient sample. Using this method, we are able to accurately detect 20% changes in the pool of cells with inducible HIV RNA.  
 The EDITS assay was performed on PB samples collected at baseline and again at [ADDRESS_976654] dose of N-803. Prior to Con A stimulation (Fig 3A) we measured a significant increase in HIV transcription after the first 2 doses but after dose 3 there were fewer transcription events. At the 6-month time-point the frequency of cells transcribing HIV was back to baseline. With ConA stimulation, (Fig 3B) the population of inducible cells was largest at baseline (before N-803) and trended lower after each subsequent dose and remained stable at the 6-month time-point. The 6 mcg/kg dose gave the most consistent increase in transcription and is the reason we are using 6 mcg/kg in this trial. Note, the interval between doses was 2 weeks for the 6 mcg/kg dose and 1 of the participants receiving 3.0 mcg/kg because   Fig 2. Edits assay to measure inducible cell-associated HIV RNA.

Effect of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   
Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  20 of the longer duration of the rash and adenopathy at the higher dose. In Figure 3 A and B we combine the data for simplicity in presentation of data to justify the 6 mcg/kg dose.  N-[ADDRESS_976655] is that the lymphoid tissue (LT) compartment is where the primary reservoir resides (5, 10-16). While many of the vRNA+ cells are located in the parafollicular T cell zone (TZ), a significant proportion of these cells are in the B cell follicle in the T follicular helper cells (Tfh). Importantly, effector cells are excluded from the B cell follicle (7) but at least one study in NHP showed that animals treated with N-803 had an increased frequency of SIV specific CD8 T cells in the follicles. N-803 has been shown to activate CD4 and CD8 T cells. In vitro, Sekaly and colleagues showed that IL-15 increases CD8 T cell proliferation by [CONTACT_25764]-regulating the expression of Id2, a transcriptional adaptor that is critical for inducing the proliferation and differentiation of CD8 memory T cells (17, 18). IL-15 induces proliferation of all CD8 T cell memory subsets and the differentiation and activation of the transitional (TTM) and effector (TEM) memory subsets (18).  N-803 has been shown to activate NK cells which is important in HIV infection. There is an association between possession of specific killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on NK cells and control of HIV infection (19-22). HIV selectively modulates MHC-I molecules on the infected cell surface which, in turn, impairs NK cell killing. The HIV protein Nef down-regulates HLA-A and –B, but not HLA-C or –E (23, 24) which reduces the susceptibility of infected cells to recognition by [CONTACT_716632]-specific T cells. The retention of HLA-C and –E impairs the response by [CONTACT_716633]2DL (KIR2DL1/2/3) and CD94/NKG2A, which are the receptors for HLA-C and –E (respectively) (25, 26). However, activation of NK cells through cytokine stimulation can lower the activation threshold and overcome this inhibitory receptor dampening to induce NK mediated target cell killing and cytokine secretion (27). While there are many cytokines and combinations of cytokines that will activate NK cells (e.g., IL-2 & IL-12)(27, 28), IL-15 is particularly appealing as it is necessary for NK cell homeostasis (29-31) and will not cause expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that can suppress NK cell responses like other cytokines might (e.g., IL-1) (32, 33).  N-803 may also restore CD8 T cell responses and cause activation and proliferation of both CD4 T and CD8 Tcells. In vitro, Sekaly and colleagues showed that IL-15 increases CD8 T cell proliferation by [CONTACT_25764]-regulating the expression of Id2, a transcriptional adaptor that is critical for inducing the proliferation and differentiation of CD8 memory T cells (17, 18). IL-15 induces proliferation of all CD8 T cell memory subsets and the differentiation and activation of the transitional (TTM) and effector (TEM) memory subsets (18).  In SIV+ Rhesus macaques, N-803 therapy is associated with significant reductions in plasma viremia. In Rhesus macaques infected with SIVmac239 for > 1 year, who were given N-803 at 0.1 mg/kg weekly for [ADDRESS_976656] dose (Fig 4) that correlated with rapid increases of CD8 T cell and NK cell numbers suggesting that NK cells and CD8 T cells may have been responsible for the rapid reduction in plasma viremia (34).

Effect of N-[ADDRESS_976660] of N-803 on CD8 T cells and NK cells (no data reported on CD4 T cells). In each of the 3 trials CD8 T cell numbers in PBMC modestly expanded and NK cells were significantly increased.  In Table 2 we present the clinical AEs that were observed in the trial for people with solid tumors (NCT 01946789). The dose escalation scheme was similar to our dose-escalation trial in people with HIV infection and representative of the other AEs reported in the other cancer trials. There has been a total of 37 serious AEs reported in the cancer trials. Of those, 9 were associated with IV infusion, 24 with subcutaneous injection, and 4 by [CONTACT_137439] (for bladder cancer).

Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  24 Pharmacokinetic Profile in Cancer Studies Pharmacokinetic data were obtained pre-dose and at 30 minutes, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after N-803 dosing in the solid tumor trial discussed above ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) where participants received either IV or SQ dosing. PK data were obtained from 2 participants in each dose cohort according to the study protocol (Fig 5). The Tmax occurred consistently at [ADDRESS_976667], SQ N-803 exhibited a very gradual increase in serum concentration, with maximal serum levels >100-fold less than the average peak after IV N-803. In [ADDRESS_976668] time point tested. Therefore, it is possible that the Tmax occurred either at or after 24 hours in these 4 subjects.  
 Fig 5: Panel A ALT-803 (AKA N-803) IV dose levels for subjects 1 – 10 are as follows: 1 = 0.3 µg/kg; 2 = 0.5 µg/kg; 3 and 4 = 1 µg/kg; 6 and 7 = 3 µg/kg; 9 and 10 = 6 µg/kg. (4.2-2) ALT-803 (AKA N-803) Panel B SQ dose levels for subjects 12 – 23 are as follows: 12 and 13 = 6µg/kg; 15 and 16 = 10 µg/kg; 18 and 19 = 15 µg/kg; 22 and 23 = 20 µg/kg.  Side-effect profile and adverse events associated with N-803 in HIV infected people Clinically the drug has been relatively well-tolerated. All participants dosed SQ experience an injection site reaction that resolves in 7-10 days. All of the HIV + patients dosed at 1 mcg/kg or higher have experienced lymphadenopathy in the draining LN and the one participant dosed at 3 mcg/kg experienced bilateral inguinal and axillary adenopathy. The adenopathy resolves in 7-10 days. There is a risk of QTc prolongation. Note: Two individuals had a grade 1 prolonged QTc interval prior to receiving study drug that persisted through follow-up. One individual experienced grade 1 prolonged QTc interval that persisted through follow-up. One individual experienced grade 1 and 2 prolonged QTc intervals that resolved. At this point in time, there is no clear connection between the administration of N-803 and these minor abnormalities.(See Table 6 below).

Two of those were for protocol changes to switch the route of administration from intravenous to subcutaneous (SQ) and to modify language in the consent for the addition of lymph node biopsies and colonoscopy procedures. Three of the pauses were for adverse events. The first was for a participant receiving 1 mcg/kg SQ who experienced an injection site reaction that was a grade 3 which resolved within 5-7 days. We modified the protocol to state” “In the case of injection site erythema or redness or injection site induration or swelling (Grades 1-3), ALT-[ADDRESS_976674] 50%. In cases where injection site reaction occurs, photographs may be taken to document the reaction and assess resolution”. We also changed the protocol to state that a grade [ADDRESS_976675] any stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. The second adverse event requiring a pause was a change in the FEV1 of >20% in one participant. In the original protocol, the baseline FEV1 was collected at screening which could have been several weeks prior to the initiation of dosing. We did not have any PFT measures collected just prior to the administration of the drug to be able to determine if the change was related to the drug. We amended the protocol to add PFT screening within 4 hours before the drug is given and again 12 and 24 (+/-4) hours after each dose. The third pause was due to a change in the eGFR for a participant at the 6.0 mcg/kg dose that qualified as a grade 3 toxicity. This individual had a baseline eGFR of 64 ml/min that was a grade 2 toxicity (< 90 to 60 ml/min) which was allowed in the protocol. His eGFR decreased to 59 ml/min which was determined by [CONTACT_716634]. It returned to baseline; per protocol, he did not receive further doses of study drug.  Each time the study was paused due to an AE, the SMC was consulted, and the FDA and IRB were notified. Protocol changes were made in consultation with the FDA and approved by [CONTACT_55295].  1.2. Study Rationale and Hypothesis As discussed above, N-803 has demonstrated ability to reactivate HIV from latency and can activate T cells and NK cells to clear those cells, thus reducing the reservoir. However, a concern is that CD8 T cells may be excluded from the B cell follicles, where a significant part of the reservoir resides. Webb, et al, has shown that in SIV infected monkeys CD8 T cells in follicles increase in frequency when N-803 is administered. We hypothesize that in HIV infected humans treated with N-803 that CD8 T cells will increase in B cell follicles and that there will be a further reduction in the frequency of cells with an inducible provirus.  1.3. Risk / Benefit Assessment There is no expected direct benefit for the study participant. The primary benefit is the gain in knowledge regarding a potentially effective intervention that may in future studies allow for a durable control of HIV in absence of therapy (a remission). There are several risks involved with this study. N-[ADDRESS_976676] of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   
Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  30 experienced by [CONTACT_716635][INVESTIGATOR_716602] 7-10 days. As seen in the cancer and HIV trials, other adverse events that may be related to the administration of N-803 include fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, chills, and injection site pain. Other potential risks include drug interactions which are discussed in section 6. Other clinical management issues that may pose a risk to the participant are discussed in section 10. Other risks involved with participation in this study include:  1) (Medical history and information from medical record) Discussion of HIV serostatus, collection of medical history, and physical exam can cause embarrassment and discomfort. Research coordinators are trained to be sensitive to stigma and embarrassment that participants may feel, and provide support. Anticipation of a medical procedure may cause stress or anxiety. All data collection and storage of PHI will be compliant with HIPAA and techniques for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in research.  2) (Blood draws and leukapheresis) Risk to study participants associated with blood draw procedures will be minimal. There is potential for bruising, bleeding, infection and mild discomfort from the venipuncture. To minimize this discomfort, there is required training and certification for research technicians, and they routinely use the smallest gauge butterfly (21 gauge) needle compatible with the protocol and prevention of hemolysis. Rarely, participants experience faintness (near-syncope or syncope) at the time of phlebotomy. The risks of leukapheresis include the risks associated with blood draws listed above, as well as fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension and air embolism. Other risks of leukapheresis include allergic reaction, damage to red blood cells, and loss of platelets. Very rare risks include heart attack, stroke, and death. Due to citrate anticoagulation, participants may experience temporary numbness or tingling of the fingertips or around the mouth, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], chills, or anxiety.   3) (Lymph node biopsy procedure) Lymph node (LN) biopsies will be performed at the University of Minnesota by [CONTACT_716636]. Schacker’s projects for over [ADDRESS_976677] biopsies on HIV+ patients for related studies without any significant adverse events. If complications do develop, at least one surgeon will be available to provide immediate and appropriate follow up care. Participants from both study sites will undergo the LN biopsies at the UMN study site.  4) (Colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) Colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_716603] U of Minnesota by [CONTACT_716637], Alexander Khoruts, MD. Conscious sedation will be used during colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_716604], and participants will be monitored by [CONTACT_716638]. Risks from colonoscopy include discomfort, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], anxiety, dizziness after sedation, and bleeding. Colonoscopy is also associated with risk of colonic perforation, estimated to occur in approximately 1/[ADDRESS_976678] of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   
Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  31 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1. Primary Objectives • To determine the impact of N-803 on the frequency and function of CD8+ T cells in B cell follicles. • To determine the safety of N-803 in HIV+ ART suppressed individuals by [CONTACT_716627]  2.2. Secondary Objectives • To determine the impact of IL-15 on the frequency, location, and phenotype of  vRNA+ and vDNA+ cells in lymphoid tissues (inguinal lymph node, ileal, and rectal tissues)  2.3. Exploratory Objectives • To determine the impact of IL-[ADDRESS_976679] HIV genomes • To determine the effect of IL-15 on frequency and activation status of NK cells in tissue and blood • Impact of N-803 on ADCC in tissues and blood • Impact of N-803 on HIV specific CTL in tissues and blood • Impact of N-[ADDRESS_976680] on measures of virus in the follicles. The two sites will be the University of Minnesota and Hennepin Healthcare. There will be a total of 10 participants. Participants will be generally healthy HIV infected men or women suppressed on ART >[ADDRESS_976681] undetectable plasma viremia, and CD4 ≥ 350 cells/µl. The study drug N-803 will be administered at 6 mcg/kg, which is the maximum tolerated dose determined in a recently completed dose-escalation trial. At screening participants will have an EKG, medical history obtained, and blood drawn to assess if they meet entry criteria. At least 7 days (up to 14) prior to the first dose of drug, an inguinal lymph node will be obtained by [CONTACT_716639], colon and ileal tissue will be obtained via colonic biopsy, and a large volume of PBMCs obtained by [CONTACT_74886]. These procedures will occur at least [ADDRESS_976682] 3 weeks and not more than 5 weeks (see 5.3). Blood will be obtained at regular intervals to monitor for drug toxicity and changes in plasma viral load and CD4 cell count. At least [ADDRESS_976683] dose (and not more than 14 days) a second set of tissue biopsies will be obtained. The participant will return for a healing assessment within the following 7 days. The participant will be seen at monthly intervals for an additional 3 months to obtain peripheral blood to monitor for long-term toxicity, including development of antibodies for IL-15.  3.1.1. Rationale for Dose and Dosing Interval In our dose escalation study with N-803 in HIV infected persons, we started with a dose of 0.3 mcg/kg IV with plans to increase to 1, 3, 6, and 10 mcg/kg IV. As we completed the 0.3 mcg/kg cohort it was

Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  32 reported that giving the drug subcutaneously (SQ) had [ADDRESS_976684] on effector cell function in B cell follicles, we will use 6 mcg/kg. This is the maximum tolerated dose from our recently completed dose-escalation trial.  In this protocol we will administer the drug every [ADDRESS_976685] chosen this dosing interval because in cancer trials, there has been a consistent observation that shorter dosing intervals are associated with decreased proliferation of NK cells and an exhausted phenotype (35) which likely explains the loss of antiviral effect with N-803 in a macaque trial when the dosing interval was shorter (34). Those investigators found the antiviral effect was restored when there was a longer period of time between dosing intervals. An exhausted phenotype is not a novel concept and has been described with T cells (36, 37) but also in experimental models of prolonged NK cell activation with prolonged exposure to ionomycin where reduced cytolytic function and cytokine production was observed (38). In studies in humans with cancer using N-803 at weekly intervals there was a diminished proliferative capacity of NK and CD8 T cells after repeated weekly dosing, and we saw this in our study (Fig 6)

Criteria for Evaluation For purposes of efficacy, only those participants who have received all [ADDRESS_976687] tissue from both timepoints, and/or has not received all 3 doses of N-803 will be replaced.  3.2.1. Primary Endpoint  • Frequency of CD8+ T cells in follicles (and their phenotypes) before and after N-[ADDRESS_976688] developed in our lab (10, 11, 15, 39-41). Briefly we will stain cells with antibodies to CD8 and determine their frequency per unit area. We have used these techniques to account for changes in CD4 T cell populations in the parafollicular T cell zone after antifibrotic therapy (42).

Effect of N-[ADDRESS_976696] of this study.  5.2. N-803 Administration (General Guidelines) 5.2.1. Formulation and Composition The biological drug product, N-803, is formulated in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. The solution appears as a clear and colorless liquid. The drug substance is produced by a recombinant mammalian cell line and is manufactured using protein-free media. Study medication is provided in a 2 mL single-dose/single-use vial containing 0.6 mL of N-803 (extractable volume is 0.5 mL) at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. The vialed quantitative composition of N-803 is listed in Table 7.  Table 7: Quantitative Composition of N-803 Component Concentration Amount / Vial N-803 2 mg/mL 1.2 mg Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) QS 0.6 mL PBS Formulation: Sodium Chloride (USP) 8.18 g/L; Sodium Phosphate Dibasic (USP) 1.43 g/L; Potassium Phosphate Monobasic (NF) 1.36 g/L pH 7.4.  5.2.2. Storage and Handling Vials are packaged in cartons and shipped to the clinical site. Study medication must be maintained at a temperature between 2˚C and 8˚C. The drug will be maintained in the Investigational Drug Service at each institution using the manufacturers guidelines for storage. The individual dose for administration to each participant will be prepared in syringes by [CONTACT_716642]. The product expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054] [ADDRESS_976697] 21 days but not more than 35 days (see section 5.3). Study drug will be provided free of charge to the study participants. The dosing interval of 21 days is to avoid the “cytokine exhaustion syndrome” that has been described using this compound in cancer trials. When the interval is too short (e.g., 7 days) the T cells and NK cells do not have the same magnitude of response to N-803 and there is less activation (as measured by [CONTACT_398]69) or proliferation (as measured by [CONTACT_15915]67). This phenomenon has been characterized in the mouse model (35) and is avoided when the interval is at least 14-[ADDRESS_976698].  The study drug N-803 will be administered at 6 mcg/kg, which is the maximum tolerated dose determined in a recently completed dose-escalation trial. 
Effect of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   
Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  37  N-803 dosing is calculated using a weight obtained on the day of each dose administration. For participants > 100 kilograms weight, the N-803 dose is calculated using a weight capped at 100 kg. The weight will be re-checked prior to each injection with the dose re-calculated if ≥ 10% change from the weight used for the baseline calculation. The calculated amount of N-803 will be drawn into a syringe for subcutaneous injection. The current IDS stock concentration is 2 mg/ml. Doses will be drawn directly into the syringe for injection.    Injections are given in the abdominal area. The injection site should be rotated per institutional guidelines and each injection site separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_976699] N-803 monitoring: Participants will be observed for a minimum of 2 hours after each dose of N-803 for immediate adverse events. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], temperature, and oxygen saturation) will be documented prior to the N-803 injection and then at 30, 60 and 120 minutes with a ± 20 minute window for each time point. If systolic blood pressure drops to less than 90, and or diastolic drops to less than 50, obtain vital signs every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. Then obtain vital signs every 15 minutes and proceed with frequent vital signs as directed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Co-I.  Administration of additional glucocorticoids is discouraged during the N-803 treatment period as the use of systemic steroid medications may result in loss of therapeutic effects of the study drug (see section 6.1).   Pre and post-therapy intervention guidelines. The intervention guidelines described in the section below can be modified by [CONTACT_716643] a protocol amendment or being considered a protocol deviation. In general, these guidelines are intended to address AEs graded 3 or greater (see Note 1 in table).

Antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine or cetirizine, should be taken for one day before and one to two days after dosing.  In combination with one of the following:  Ranitidine  300 mg  Orally  Cimetidine  300 mg  Orally  Famotidine  20 mg  Orally  Hypotension  Normal saline (0.9%)  2 mL/kg/hr (up to 100 mL/hr)***  Continuous IV  Begin 30 min prior to and for 6 hours after each dose  Nausea/  Vomiting/  Ondansetron  0.2 mg/kg (up to 8 mg)  IV  30 min prior to each dose  OR other 5-HT3 antagonists at the discretion of the Investigator.  Pain  Hydromorphone  0.5 mg  IV  30 min prior to each dose  OR other opi[INVESTIGATOR_716613] ***In the last 2 hours, if BP does drops slightly, it is recommended to increase the normal saline rate to 250 mL/hr (given no evidence of fluid overload) and give over 2 hours until pressure is 90 mm systolic or more stable. Alternatively, if this has occurred previously, a higher rate of fluid administration from the start of the dosing protocol (i.e. 200 mL/hr over 6 hours) can be used as long as there are no signs of fluid overload (i.e. crackles in the lungs or peripheral edema or > 10% weight gain).  Note 1: Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine will be administered approximately [ADDRESS_976701] to the participant. Note 2: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication including acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen may be given per physician discretion following the recommended dosing thresholds:  Acetaminophen: not to exceed 3000 mg (3 grams) in 24 hours  Ibuprofen: not to exceed 2400 mg in 24 hours  Naproxen: not to exceed 1100 mg in 24 hours  Note 3: The use of systemic steroid medications may result in loss of therapeutic effects of the study drug and should be avoided; however, in the event of a life-threatening inflammatory reaction to N-803, the IV administration of dexamethasone or other steroid-based medication is warranted.   Based on current experience, localized skin reactions are common with subcutaneous administration. If a reaction occurs and the reaction area surrounding the N-803 injection site is > 6 cm or symptomatic (painful and/or itchy), it may be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 0.05% clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847], 0.1% triamcinolone, or 1% hydrocortisone cream. Diphenhydramine may be administered pre- (25-50 mg TID orally) and 
Effect of N-[ADDRESS_976702]-dosing (25-50 mg TID orally x 2 days) of N-803 at the discretion of the treating physician. Diphenhydramine should be eliminated if not tolerated. Generally, the reaction associated with an N-803 starts small at the site of the injection and spreads outwardly sometimes covering a large area of the abdomen. It generally resolves within 7-9 days of treatment.  5.3. Individual Dose Delays N-803 administration may be delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 14 days (resulting in a maximum 35 day period between doses) if on the day of the planned dosing for any of the following situations: • the participant has a fever (defined as a temperature of > 100.4°F (38°C)) • treatment related side effects have not resolved to grade 1 or better  • if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021], a delay would be of benefit   However, if dosing is delayed for one of these reasons the participant will be evaluated at the end of [ADDRESS_976703] will receive the dose as soon as possible. If the participant does not receive the dose within the drug administration window (up to [ADDRESS_976704] the planned dosing day), they will be discontinued and replaced.  6. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS All participants should be maintained on the same medications throughout the entire study period, as medically feasible.   Participants must provide their own antiretroviral drugs. No restrictions will be placed on the antiretroviral drug combinations. If medically feasible, study participants will be encouraged to remain on their entry antiretroviral regimen through the entire study period. If a participant’s ART regimen does change, refer to section 11.[ADDRESS_976705]’s standard of care.   Prohibited and contraindicated medications are defined below. There are no precautionary medications. 6.1. Prohibited Medications 1. Glucocorticoids: • These have been shown to reduce cytokine-induced side effects including fever, renal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, confusion, and dyspnea, concomitant administration of these agents with N-803 may reduce the biologic effectiveness of N-803. Therefore, administration of glucocorticoids is prohibited during N-803 treatment period.  • They should be avoided except in the event of a severe toxicity or unrelated condition requiring steroid and their use will be an indication to stop N-803.  • Inhaled, nasal spray, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_537289]. 2. Chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_716614]: • Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose IL-[ADDRESS_976706] of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   
Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  40 and hypotension and occurred within hours of administration of chemotherapy. Concomitant chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_716614]-a with N-803 are prohibited.  3. IL-2 and interferon: • Myocardial injury, including myocardial infarction, myocarditis, ventricular hypokinesia, and severe rhabdomyolysis appear to be increased in patients receiving IL-2 and interferon-α concomitantly. Exacerbation or the initial presentation of a number of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders has been observed following concomitantly use of interferon-α and IL-2, including crescentic IgA glomerulonephritis, oculo-bulbar myasthenia gravis, inflammatory arthritis, thyroiditis, bullous pemphigoid, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Therefore, concomitant interferon-α treatment with N-803 is prohibited.   6.2. Contraindicated Medications All of the potential drug interactions with cytokine therapy listed below might occur with N-803 treatment. Contraindicated medications will be generally avoided when possible, but will be allowed in situations deemed low clinical risk per the discretion of study investigators.  Medication dosing, frequency (intermittent for symptom alleviation vs continuous), and indication will be considered in these decisions 1. Psychotropic drugs: • Central nervous function may be affected. Therefore, interactions could occur following concomitant administration of psychotropic drugs (e.g., narcotics, analgesics, antiemetics, sedatives). Intermittent use of oxycontin (5 mg tablets) is permitted for procedure related pain or if required for trauma. Analgesics purchased over the counter are permitted. The sleep aides Ambien and Lunesta are permitted. SSRI/SNRIs are considered low risk, and if used in standard doses are allowed.  Other psychotropic medications that are not currently associated with sedating or cognitive side effects and are not being used to treat symptoms related to psychosis or alterations in thought processing are also allowed. 2. Kidney and liver • Kidney and liver function may be impaired during the treatment. Use of concomitant nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy, which are excluded anyhow), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin, which is excluded anyhow) or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, asparaginase, which are excluded anyhow) medications may further increase toxicity to the kidney or liver. These medications should be generally minimized during N-803 regimen treatment period. 3. Beta-blockers  • may potentiate the hypotension seen with cytokine therapy. Therefore, administration of these medications should be avoided during the N-[ADDRESS_976707] (HIPAA) authorization must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_423].

Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  41 Blood collection will occur at indicated visits and will be timed to stay within Red Cross Guidelines (less than 500 mL every 8 weeks). 7.1. Medication Review All concomitant medications taken within 30 days prior to screening and entry and a complete history of ART, HIV-1 related vaccines, and immune-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_716615].   At each subsequent visit, all additions or discontinuations of prescription medications should be recorded. Actual or estimated start and stop dates should be recorded.  7.2. Demographics and Medical History Demographic information (date of birth, sex, race and ethnicity) will be recorded at Screening.  At Screening, the medical history must include all diagnoses within the past 30 days and, regardless of when the diagnosis was made, a complete history of chronic conditions, malignancies, and AIDS-defining conditions. Self-reported or documented nadir CD4+ T cell count should be recorded.   Any allergies to any medications or their formulations should also be recorded.  7.3. Clinical Assessment Signs and Symptoms At screen and baseline visits, all grades of signs and symptoms that occurred [ADDRESS_976708] be recorded as part of an Adverse Event (AE) assessment. Duration (start and stop dates and times), severity/grade, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug will be recorded on the case report form (CRF). Criteria for participant management, dose interruptions, modifications, and discontinuation of treatment will be mandated only for toxicities attributable to the study medication(s).   Diagnoses All clinical events and new diagnoses or changes in diagnoses should be recorded.   7.4. Physical Examination Complete Physical Exam A complete physical examination should be conducted at screening. It is to include at minimum an examination of the skin, head, mouth, and neck, auscultation of the chest, cardiac and abdominal exam, and examination of the lower extremities for edema. The complete physical exam will also include resting vital signs (temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure), height and weight.   Targeted Physical Exam or Assessment A targeted physical examination should be conducted by [CONTACT_716644]. Targeted physical assessments can be conducted by [CONTACT_716645]. It is to include resting vital signs (temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure) and weight, and is to be driven by [CONTACT_716646].

Hematology Complete blood count with differential (CBCD) will be obtained at the indicated visits.  Chemistry Basic metabolic chemistry panel (CBASIC) and hepatic panel (BHEPAT) will be obtained at the indicated visits. This will include serum sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2, anion gap, random glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, eGFR, aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin, and total protein.    Pregnancy Testing A serum or urine β-human chorionic gonadotropin HCG test (urine test must have a sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL) will be obtained from female participants with reproductive potential at screening, prior to each dosing visit, and anytime during the study when pregnancy is suspected.   Hepatitis B Testing Hepatitis B antibodies will be measured, and, if positive, a Hepatitis B antigen test will be obtained at Screen.   Hepatitis C Testing Hepatitis C antibodies will be measured and, if positive, a Hepatitis C PCR will be obtained at Screen.  Tuberculosis Testing A quantiferon gold test will be ordered at screening. If the test is positive and the potential participant has no prior history of TB treatment they will be referred to their primary provider for further testing. If they do have a history of prior treatment they will be considered eligible for the study.  7.6. HIV Clinical Laboratory Measures Blood will be obtained and sent to a CLIA-certified laboratory for real-time determination of absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, percentages, and CD4/CD8 ratio and plasma HIV-1 RNA quantification (viral load) at the indicated visits. All efforts should be made to have collection of blood for T cell counts occur between 8am and 11am, in order to account for diurnal variation in CD4+ T cell count.   7.7. Cryopreservation of Plasma Plasma will be collected and stored at the indicated visits per the appropriate laboratory standards of procedure.  7.8. Cryopreservation of PBMCs PBMCs will be collected and stored at the indicated visits per the appropriate laboratory standards of procedure.

Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  43 7.9. Collection of PAXgene Specimen Whole blood will be collected in PAXgene tubes at the indicated visits. Blood will be collected in the following upright tubes - PAXgene Blood RNA Tube (16x200 mm / 2.5 mL). The tubes must be filled completely. Specimens will be shipped overnight on wet ice or stored at -80 freezer until ready to ship.  7.10. Immunologic Measures T cell and NK immunogenicity. T cell immunogenicity will be measured via several different assays. T cell activation, proliferation, and function: Routine flow cytometric analysis of sorted T cells (CD4 and CD8) will be completed to assess markers of proliferation and activation. Briefly, purified PBMCs and LN cell suspensions from baseline and after the last dose of N-803 will be thawed, and stimulated with various HIV peptides. Cells will be incubated for 6 hours in the presence of Brefeldin A at 37°C. Antibody panels using some or all of the following surface molecules will be used to assess the quantity, phenotype, and function of responding CD4 and CD8 T cells: Aqua Blue, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD27, CD45RO, CD57, CCR7, PD-1, ICOS, CD150, CXCR5, and CCR6. These panels will allow discrimination of differentiated CD8 and CD4 memory and TFH phenotypes. In panels using fewer surface markers we will also assess function by [CONTACT_716647]: IFNgamma, IL-2, TNF, MIP-1alpha, and IL-21. Following identification of small live lymphocytes and T cells, a gate will be set for each respective phenotype using combinations that provided optimal separation (central memory, effector memory, peripheral TFH, germinal center TFH). Boolean gate platform will be used to create the full array of possible functional combinations for each phenotype.  NK activation, proliferation, function and exhaustion (Miller Laboratory, UMN): To assess blood and LT NK cell functional activity, flow cytometric analysis for NK cell degranulation (CD107a) and type-II interferon production will be performed on NK cells isolated from all tissue compartments using K562 cells (a human leukemia cell line) as targets. In addition, we will evaluate the killing of HIV-infected targets by [CONTACT_362129]-3 and -7 (CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Flow Cytometry Assay Kit, ThermoFisher). Primary CD4s will be isolated and in vitro infected from patient samples with a variety of primary HIV strains obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program as previously described (43). HIV-infected CD4+ T cells are then enriched by [CONTACT_716648] a CD4 positive selection to remove all uninfected cells. NK and HIV-infected cells are then cultured at an effector to target ratio of 5:1. As shown in (Fig 7) resting autologous NK cells degranulate 3-fold greater against HIV-infected T cells than uninfected CD4’s. This suggests that NK cells can recognize HIV-infected CD4+ T cells presumably through upregulation of NKG2D ligands ULBP1/2, as shown previously (44). The ability of NK cells from N-803 treated participants to mediate ADCC will also be evaluated. NK cells isolated from participant PBMC will be exposed to the CD20 expressing B-cell line, Raji, in the presence and absence of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, Rituxin. Rituxin bound Raji cells are a potent inducer of ADCC through Rituxin’s Fc portion bound to CD16. ADCC will be evaluated by [CONTACT_716649]107a after exposure to targets.  
Effect of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   
Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  44  Fig 7: Functional response of primary NK cells to autologous HIV-infected T cells. Purified primary NK cells and CD4+ T cells were isolated from the same healthy donor using magnetic columns. NK cells were co-cultured (E:T ratio of 5:1 for 4 hours) with autologous CD4+ T cells or CD4+ T cells in vitro infected with HIV. Cells were then stained for CD56 and CD107a and analyzed by [CONTACT_716650]-infected CD4+ T cells or uninfected controls.  To measure the possibility of NK cell exhaustion after N-803 treatment, we will compare NK cells isolated from PBMC prior to and 7 days after each N-803 dose for the following analyses validated in our lab: 1) NK cell degranulation measured after 4 hour exposure to K562 cells; 2) NK cell proliferation by [CONTACT_716651]; 3) NK cell expression of transcription factors T-bet and Eomesodermin by [CONTACT_716652]; 4) NK cell expression of checkpoints PD-1 and TIGIT expression; 5) NK cell metabolic exhaustion by [CONTACT_716653]1a expression. CPT1a is a key component of FAO machinery, shown by [CONTACT_716654]-15. We will also look for IL-15 receptor components (IL-15Ra, b, and g) to look for modulation after N-[ADDRESS_976709] activation of monocytes and macrophages.   We will also explore if the newly described “adaptive NK cells” are stimulated by N-803 and if they play a role in reservoir reduction. Adpative NK cells lack the HLA-E specific inhibitory receptor, NKG2A, but posess the activating receptor NKG2C (45). These cells also lack the CD16 adaptor molecule, FcεR1γ, but retain CD3ζ for potent signaling. While the mechanism is still not well understood, this population appears to be induced or expanded in the context of past CMV infection and is enhanced with CMV reactivation as often happens in immunosuppressed people. We have shown that “adaptive” NK cells have increased function over conventional NK cells (46) and that these cells have a hypomethymation signature [CONTACT_716678]8 T cells, are distinct from conventional NK cells and exhibit properties of immune memory. One striking difference between adaptive NK cell and T cell responses are that adaptive NK cells have enhanced responses to targets different from the antigens that induced their initial development (47). While the proportion of adaptive NK cells needed to erradicate disease is not known, we hypothesize that N-803 will enhance the function of this unique subset and we will explore if this is important for reservoir reduction. NK cell phenotype will be assessed for CD56, NKG2C, NKG2A, CD16, FcεR1γ and CD3ζ by [CONTACT_716655] N-803 therapy to determine if N-803 induces expansion of the “adaptive” NK cell subset. Considering the enhanced function of “adaptive” NK cells and the importance of CD16 expressing NK cells in mediating ADCC, it is important to understand how these subsets respond to N-[ADDRESS_976710] of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   
Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  45 NK cells (mixed conventional and adaptive from CMV+ donors) degranulate and produce type-II interferon in response to the HIV-infected T cell lines (HIVIIIB and ACH-2) compared to their uninfected counterparts (H9 and CEM CD4). Thus, endogenous NK cells or healthy donor NK cells alone may be good enough to eradicate HIV reservoir infected cells. However, it is possible that other signals will be needed.  7.11. Virologic Measures We will apply a broad range of virologic assays to the samples collected to measure changes to the virus reservoir, by [CONTACT_716656]. Our focus is on the B cell follicle, especially infected T follicular helper cells (TFh).  EDITS assay (Karn Laboratory, Case Western Reserve University): [CONTACT_716680] has recently developed a novel Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based protocol, called EDITS (Envelope Detection by [CONTACT_654075]-based Sequencing), to measure inducible cell-associated HIV RNA (8). This assay is extremely sensitive and will allow us to both determine the extent of proviral reactivation in response to N-[ADDRESS_976711], and GALT will be analyzed with and without ConA stimulation and the number of cell equivalents that are transcribing HIV will be determined. Sequences of envelope are detected using a nested PCR on 1.25 x106 resting memory cells from participants before and after ConA stimulation. Samples from different participants are bar-coded, pooled, and sequenced simultaneously which saves both time and sequencing costs, and allows accurate comparisons since input cDNA levels are effectively normalized. All EDITS experiments include control reactions set up without the addition of reverse transcriptase, as well as no template controls. In addition, this assay is quantitative because latently infected cells carry, on average, only one provirus (9) and therefore the frequency of inducible RNAs is proportional to the numbers of inducible cells in each of the wells. Comparing the reads obtained in the EDITS assay after maximal activation of cells by [CONTACT_716630] a standard curve obtained by [CONTACT_716657]. Using this method, we are able to accurately detect 20% changes in the pool of cells with inducible HIV RNA.  Ultrasensitive qPCR diagnostics will be used to quantify HIV RNA to single-copy levels.  Cell-associated (CA) total RNA (48) and integrated DNA (49) will be quantified using qPCR assays where nucleic acid input is normalized to cell number. These or similar techniques will be used to identify HIV viral reservoir in adipose tissue.  7.12. Leukapheresis Leukapheresis will be performed at Day -[ADDRESS_976712] clinic policies and procedures. Leukapheresis will occur in the apheresis center and will require an apheresis consult visit. Leukapheresis is not a study-specific procedure.  If the participant is not eligible for leukapheresis based on the apheresis consultation appointment, an ultrasound-guided large volume (60 mL) blood draw be scheduled at the CRU instead.   
Effect of N-[ADDRESS_976713] safely performed this procedure on > [ADDRESS_976714] a local anesthetic and make a small (5 cm) incision over the lymph node. The lymph node and adjacent adipose tissue will be removed and the incision closed.

Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) A pulmonary function test will be done at Day -[ADDRESS_976716]. Processing and storage for preservation of live cells, DNA and RNA or FFPE tissues occurs as soon as the samples arrive in the lab. Samples preserved for preservation of live cells are maintained in liquid nitrogen in a freezer facility at the Microbiology Research Facility that is monitored by a programmable scanning alarm system wired into the university’s telephone system.

Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  47 7.18. COVID-19 Screening and Testing During the COVID-19 pandemic, we will screen for COVID-19 symptoms before the patients arrive for visits and get a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 2-4 -days prior to any injections or procedures (with noted exceptions below). Participants will be asked to isolate at home after their PCR test and prior to injections and biopsy visits.  If COVID-19 is diagnosed at any time during the study, the patient will be instructed to isolate according to current recommendations provided by [CONTACT_716658] (CDC). Any missed study visits resulting from COVID-[ADDRESS_976717] persistent/recurrent positive PCR tests during that period despi[INVESTIGATOR_716616]. Based on these observations, participants with a prior documented history of COVID-[ADDRESS_976718] dose follow-up visits; and asked to collect sample within [ADDRESS_976719] all visits occur between 8am and 11am, in order to account for diurnal variation in CD4+ T cell count and other assays and to allow for prompt specimen processing.  Once a participant is identified as potentially eligible by [CONTACT_716659] a screening visit, a unique identifier will be assigned. New participants will be assigned a unique number Once a unique ID is utilized, it cannot be reassigned to another subject.  Participants who satisfy all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study, which is summarized in the Schedule of Events below.  As stated in section 5.3, N-803 administration may be delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 14 days (resulting in a maximum 35 day period between doses).

Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  58 occur as part of the disease process or underlying medical conditions are considered unexpected.  • Unanticipated (unexpected) problems/events as defined by [CONTACT_716661], not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or not part of an underlying disease.  9.2. AE Severity The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Corrected Version 2.1 (July 2017) (http://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-research-sites/daids-adverse-event-grading-tables) should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant.   9.3. AE Relationship to Study Drug The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the guidelines in  Table 8.  Table 8: AE Relationship to Study Drug Relationship to Drug Comment Related There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the study agent(s).  Not related There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study agent(s).    9.4. Reporting Procedures The Investigator, or study staff, will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents. Adverse events will be recorded in the participant CRF. Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause. All lab values will be frequently monitored by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_716617]-Investigator in a timely manner. They will review these data, assess degree of severity, and make a relationship assessment to study drug. Study sites will document all AEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug). The collection period for all AEs will begin after informed consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.  All SAEs will be evaluated to assess if the event meets reporting criteria in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC). SAEs will also be reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) per the reporting requirements specified by 21 CFR 312.32, with copy to the DAIDS Medical Officer (MO). Details of all related SAEs will be sent to the SMC and DAIDS MO no later than 3 reporting days after the investigators become aware of the event. For the purposes of expedited reporting to the SMC and the DAIDS Medical Officer, the definition of a “reporting day” in Version 2.0 (January 2010) of the DAIDS EAE Manual https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-research-sites/manual-expedited-reporting-adverse-events-daids will be used.

Should a subject become pregnant after enrolling in the trial, she will not be given any further treatments with study drug and follow-up invasive procedures (LN biopsy, leukapheresis, and colon biopsy) will not be performed. The pregnancy will be reported to the antiretroviral pregnancy registry. A Pregnancy Form will be completed by [CONTACT_716662] [ADDRESS_976745]’s permission to query pregnancy outcome and follow each subject to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. When permission is received, participants will continue to be followed for safety assessments to trial discharge per protocol. Results will be summarized in the clinical study report (CSR).  Participants who become pregnant at any point during the trial will continue to be followed for safety assessments without receiving further study drug. Procedures that are contraindicated during pregnancy, including additional treatments, must not be performed. Investigators should use clinical judgment regarding subsequent trial-related blood collection based on the presence or absence of anemia in each subject.   All pregnancies that occur from the time of first screening procedure through four months after completing the study must be reported. The Investigator will monitor the participant and follow the outcome of the pregnancy. If the end of the pregnancy occurs after the trial has been completed, the outcome will be reported directly to the trial team and the DAIDS MO.  Male participants will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately inform the Investigator if their partner becomes pregnant until the end of follow-up period. A Pregnancy Form will be completed by [CONTACT_716663] [ADDRESS_976746] and report details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male participant exposed to study drug or device. The pregnant partner will need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow up on her pregnancy. Once the authorization has been signed, the Investigator will update the Pregnancy Form with additional information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy. An Investigator who is contact[CONTACT_716664], to support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or obstetrician.  9.7. Reporting Requirements to Nant Drug Safety Serious AEs (SAEs), whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to Nant Drug Safety (Nant) within [ADDRESS_976747] be recorded on a SAE report form or MedWatch form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form (Nant to provide).

Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  62 If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to Nant using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization. The Sponsor/Investigator will ensure that all SAEs in the clinical database are reported to Nant and any applicable health authority during the conduct of the study. This reconciliation will occur at least quarterly and be initiated by [CONTACT_456]/investigator.   Sponsor/investigator will request a reconciliation report from: [EMAIL_13722] During reconciliation, any events found to not be reported previously to Nant must be sent to: [EMAIL_13722].   The Sponsor/Investigator will be responsible for submitting all safety correspondence to the FDA.  Nant will be provided with a simultaneous copy of all Serious adverse event submissions filed with the FDA.   All SAEs submitted to the FDA should simultaneously be faxed or e-mailed to NANT at: Fax Number: [PHONE_14921] Email: [EMAIL_13722]  10. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES  Injection Site Reaction Reaction at the injection site, characterized as “Injection Site Erythema or Redness” and/or” Injection Site Induration or Swelling”, is an expected and clinically insignificant toxicity. Per the arrangement made with the FDA during the course of the previous dose escalation study, all Grade [ADDRESS_976748] returned to baseline within 5-10 days of dosing.  Grading for lymph node adenopathy is not contained in the DAIDS toxicity grading scale, therefore, we will grade all lymph node adenopathy with the following grading scheme:    Parameter Grade 0 Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Lymph Node Adenopathy No increase in Adenopathy Increase in size of nodes to >5 cm by [CONTACT_716665] > 5 cm that lasts > 7 days but < 14 days or; Increase in size of nodes to >5 cm for > 14 days or; Adenitis diagnosed by 
[CONTACT_716666] N-[ADDRESS_976749] with fever >101.5° F or; Any other evidence of infection  Administration of study drug should be put on hold until resolved if the lymphadenopathy is a Grade [ADDRESS_976750] will be followed to resolution, and a consultation will be obtained if further assessment is required.  Infection Antibiotics can be administered to treat infections.   Fever and chills Acetaminophen, indomethacin and hydromorphone can be administered to reduce fever and chills.  Administration of study drug should be put on hold if Grade 3 or greater. A clinical assessment will be done.  Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting Antidiarrheals can be used to combat diarrhea; antiemetics can be used to attenuate nausea and vomiting. Steroid-based anti-emetics are not allowed.   Pruritus and dermatitis Hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine can be used to control the symptoms from pruritus. Lotions, topi[INVESTIGATOR_142739], and ointments should be applied as needed for skin manifestations (see section 5.2.3).   Life-threatening toxicities Life-threatening toxicities, if they are attributed to inflammatory reactions of N-803 in the judgment of the investigators, may be ameliorated by [CONTACT_716667]-based medications.  No further injections of study drug will be administered to that participant. This would trigger a study pause.  Other supportive care  Other supportive care deemed necessary by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_716619]’s’ welfare. This will include any isolated deviations or modifications of the care plans outlined above. If it is the case that the same modifications are apparently needed more systematically, then a protocol modification will be considered in consultation with the Sponsor and co-investigators.  
Effect of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   
Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  64 Previous editions of the ALT-803 Investigator’s Brochure relied heavily on clinical experience with the related cytokine therapeutic Proleukin® Interleukin2 to anticipate potential risks associated with ALT-803 (N-803) administration. This approach was based on the fact that N-[ADDRESS_976751] recent IB (version 6 dated April 2019) indicates that many side effects of IL-[ADDRESS_976752] been removed from the IB and are reflected in this protocol and its consent form. Refer to the current Investigator Brochure (April 2019 version 6) for additional information   11. DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT OF PARTICIPANTS 11.1. Early Removal A participant may be removed from study treatment at any time if the participant or the study team feels that it is not in the participant’s best interest to continue. The following is a list of possible reasons for study removal: • Participant withdrawal of consent  • Participant is not compliant with study procedures • Adverse event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_357082] o Including but not limited to a Grade 4 injection site reaction, sustained use of steroids, any life-threatening AE, a Grade 3 QTc prolongation, and/or EKG evidence for ischemia at Days 21 & 42. • Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment • Lost to follow-up • Sponsor request for early termination of study • Positive pregnancy test (females) • A protocol violation If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the subject will be followed and treated by [CONTACT_41848].  All participants who discontinue study treatment should come in for an early discontinuation visit as soon as possible and then should be encouraged to complete all remaining scheduled visits and procedures.  11.2. Withdrawal of Participants from the Study A subject may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the subject, the investigator, or the Sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.   All participants are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice.  
Effect of N-[ADDRESS_976753]’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the subject’s source documents. As noted above, participants who discontinue study treatment early should have an early discontinuation visit.  11.3. Replacement of Participants If a participant discontinues participation for any reason they will be replaced so that there are 10 evaluable participants. Participants will be discontinued and replaced if they:  • fail to receive all 3 injections of N-803 • fail to receive an injection of N-803 within the dose administration window as defined in section 5.3 • fail to have one or all of the procedures (i.e. colon biopsy, lymph node biopsy, and leukapheresis) at both indicated timepoints • initiate systemic steroids or other prohibited medications per section 6.1 • have any change in ART regimen that demonstrates a loss of viral control by [CONTACT_716668] 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL on two consecutive measures separated by [CONTACT_28114] • receive a clinical vaccination during the study period (other than influenza or SARS-CoV-2)  The safety data from all of the participants will be reported regardless of whether or not they completed the study or if they were withdrawn and/or replaced. Safety results will be reported for all enrolled and treated participants.  11.4. Study Pause Criteria Enrollment of new participants and the administration of study drug for enrolled participants will be paused and the study plan re-evaluated after consultation with the SMC if: • any single grade >4 adverse event, laboratory abnormality, and/or life-threatening toxicity.  • if > 2 participants experience a study drug-related Grade 3 AE. (Grade 3 injection site reactions are excluded from these criteria) or • a pattern of significant symptoms, physical findings, or laboratory abnormalities (adverse events) that, although individually minor, collectively represent a safety concern in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. The team of investigators will review all AEs every [ADDRESS_976754] safety, and or primary endpoint criteria. Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following: • Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria • Use of a prohibited concomitant medication • Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a protocol 
Effect of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease   
Protocol Version 4.4 January 21, 2022  66 violation.  When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the study team and a Note to File detailing the violation will be generated. A copy of the note to file will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder. All critical events must be written up by [CONTACT_716669]. This will be filed with the DAIDS Medical Officer (MO), the institution’s IRB, and in the site’s regulatory binder.  13. STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS Prior to database lock, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written describing all analyses that will be performed. The SAP will contain any modifications to the analysis plan described below.   13.1. Data Sets Analyzed The data set used for statistical analyses will contain hematology measures from all indicated visits;  height and weight from the physical exam (for calculation of BMI); HIV clinical laboratory measures collected at indicated study visits;  markers of T cell proliferation and activation from flow cytometry analysis; measures of NK activation and function from LT and blood samples; number of HIV transcribing cell equivalents from the EDITS assay measured in blood and LT; demographic information; and medical history for all participants who satisfy the inclusion criteria.  13.2. Safety Analysis Any AEs will be reported in a study report that will document AEs and completeness of data. This report will include the total number of AEs and total number of participants experiencing an AE. AEs will be summarized in terms of severity and relatedness. Safety results will be reported for all enrolled and treated participants.  13.3. Data Analysis Plan The primary endpoint for this study is change in frequency of CD8+ T cells in follicles as measured in the LN. Secondary endpoints include change in frequency of CD8+ T cells in GALT, change in frequency of vRNA+ TFH cells, frequency of viral RNA + cells as measured by [CONTACT_716670], and percent of NK cells expressing activation and ADCC function markers. Prior to analysis, measures reflecting cell count will be log-transformed and percentages will be arcsine transformed. Due to the exploratory nature of the proposed study, all analyses involving the secondary endpoints will be presented in entirety without adjustments for multiple comparisons using a significance level of 0.05.  Linear regression models will be used to assess change in measurements collected only at two timepoints, before and after administration of N-803, including: LT measures of frequency of CD8 T+ cells in the follicles, frequency of vRNA+ TFH cells, amount of HIV RNA/DNA, and percent of NK cells expressing activation and ADCC function markers. The outcome for the models will be change in measurement and baseline level of the measure will be included as a covariate. We will use two-sided tests for assessing if the model intercepts deviate from zero.  Mixed effects models with subject specific random intercepts will be used to evaluate measures collected throughout the study including: PB measures of plasma viral load, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and percentages, CD4/CD8 ratios, and percent of NK cells expressing activation and ADCC function markers. These models will initially test for a linear change over time, but nonlinear trajectories using natural splines 
Effect of N-[ADDRESS_976755] of N-803 on CD8+ T cells in B cell follicles in humans, preliminary data is limited. In a recent study investigating changes in SIV-specific CD8+ T cells in response to N-803 (Webb et al., 2018), the investigators found that in 9 tissue samples from 6 SIV-infected macaques the frequency of SIV-specific CD8+ T cells per mm2 in the B cell follicle drastically increased after N-[ADDRESS_976756] p-value of 0.0102. Assuming N-803 has a similar response in humans (Cohen's d = 1.11), and using a type-I error rate of 0.05, our study with [ADDRESS_976757] approximately 87% power to detect an effect of this size or greater.   As this is an uncontrolled study, no randomization will be conducted.   14. DATA COLLECTION, RETENTION AND MONITORING 14.1. Data Collection Instruments The Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject treated with the study drug.

At critical junctures of the protocol (e.g., production of interim reports and final reports), data for analysis is locked and cleaned per established procedures.  14.5. Availability and Retention of Investigational Records The Investigator must make study data accessible to the monitor, other authorized representatives of the Sponsor (or designee), IRB/IEC, and Regulatory Agency (e.g., FDA) inspectors upon request. A file for each subject must be maintained that includes the signed Informed Consent, HIPAA Authorization Form and copi[INVESTIGATOR_29131]. The Investigator must ensure the reliability and availability of source documents from which the information on the CRF was derived.  All study documents (subject files, signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_3110], Study File, etc.) must be kept secured for a period of two years following marketing of the investigational product or for two years after centers have been notified that the IND has been discontinued. There may be other circumstances for which the Sponsor is required to maintain study records and, therefore, the Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_123819].  14.6. Monitoring The site initiation visit will be conducted by a monitor from DAIDS, not the University of Minnesota.  This study will be monitored at a minimum of every 6 months by [CONTACT_716671]’s Clinical Trial Monitoring Program. This program will monitor both the University of Minnesota and Hennepin Healthcare study sites. The study monitor will review subject records to ensure protection of study subjects, compliance with the protocol and accuracy and completeness of the protocol. All subject records will be monitored for appropriate consent and eligibility. A minimum 10% of the case report form data for will be monitored against the source documents for data verification. The monitors also will inspect regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements are being followed and pharmacy to review product storage and management.  Clinical site monitoring visits will be conducted according to the U.S. CFR Title 21 Parts 50, 56, and 312 and ICH Guidelines for GCP (E6). By [CONTACT_12570], the Investigator grants permission to the Sponsor (UMN), DAIDS, and appropriate regulatory authorities to conduct on-site monitoring and/or auditing of all appropriate study documentation.  The study data manager and statistician will prepare a quarterly report of accrual, and study discontinuations (and related reasons), baseline characteristics, Grade ≥ 2 signs and symptoms, Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_976759] of N-803 on B Cell Follicles in Antiretroviral Treated HIV Disease

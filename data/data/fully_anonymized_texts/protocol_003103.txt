CONFIDENTIAL   Page 7 Study Design:  This will be an open -label study to determine the safety, dose tolerance, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CPX -POM in patients with newly 
diagnosed or recurrent , untreated  or intravesical treatment completed  
>6 months before the current diagnosis , resectable tumors.  Approximately 
12 patients will be enrolled and treated with 900 mg/m2 CPX-POM 
administered IV over [ADDRESS_575883] CPX -POM dose on Day 1, pre -dose blood 
(plasma) and urine (clean catch) samples will be collected.  At the time of 
TURBT on Day 5, one 3-mL blood (plasma) sample and a urine specimen will be collected for measurement of CPX-POM concentrations.   
Patients will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_575884] dose of CPX-POM 
for safety.  
Number of Patients 
Planned:  Approximately 12 patients will be enrolle d. 
Target Population:  The target population for this study is p atients with  newly diagnosed bladder 
tumors, inclusive of recurrent disease,  who are treatment -naïve or had treatment 
completed >6  months before screening, and will be scheduled to undergo 
TURBT 
Duration of Study: Patients will be in this study for approximately 9 weeks:  up to a 28-day screening period, a 5 -day treatment period, and a 30-day follow -up period.  
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria:  Patients eligible for enrollment will be adults who  are likely to have a new 
bladder tumor based on clinical presentation or who are at high risk for tumor recurrence based on previous history, which is subsequently confirmed  
cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_451648].  Patients must be 
treatment-naïve or had treatment completed >[ADDRESS_575885] an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >30 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_575886], Dose, and Mode of Administration: Patients will begin treatment with CPX -POM on a Monday, 4 days before the 
date of scheduled TURBT on a Friday.  Patients will receive CPX- POM 
900 mg/m
[ADDRESS_575887] dose on Day  5.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration: Not applicable.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  Safety and Dose Tolerance : 
Safety and tolerability will be based on an assessment of AEs, physical 
examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms ( ECGs), clinical laboratory tests, 
ophthalmologic assessments, and concomitant medications.

2.1. Background on CPX -POM 
Fosciclopi[INVESTIGATOR_296108] (CPX- POM) is a prodrug of ciclopi[INVESTIGATOR_296108] (CPX).  CPX is a synthetic antifungal 
agent approved for topi[INVESTIGATOR_451655] a broa d spectrum of fungal 
organisms ( Gupta, 2001).  CPX and ciclopi[INVESTIGATOR_70334] (CPX -O) are contained in a number 
of marketed topi[INVESTIGATOR_312163].  CPX also exerts antibacterial activity against many 
Gram-positive and Gram- negative bacteria ( Abrams et al, 1991).  CPX is a hydroxypyridone 
that is structurally unrelated to other antifungal agents and has a unique and complex mode of action.  CPX is thought to act through the chelation of polyvalent metal cations, such as iron and aluminum, resulting in the inhibition of the metal -dependent enzyme systems (e.g., 
cytochromes, catalase, peroxidase), thus disrupting cellular activities, such as inhibiting degradation of peroxides within the fungal cells ( Gupta and Plott, 2004 ) and mitochondrial 
electron transport processes and energy production ( Sakurai et al, 1978; Gupta et al, 1994).  
It is also thought that CPX affects the cytoplasmic membranes, inhibiting transport of essential elements in the fungal cell, disrupting the synthesis of DNA, ribonucleic acid 
(RNA), and protein ( Gupta and Plott, 2004).  In addition, CPX may have anti- inflammatory 
activity as demonstrated by [CONTACT_451683] ( Abrams et al, 1991) and to inhibit the 
formation of 5 -lipoxygenase and ciclo-oxygenase ( Bohn and Kraemer,  2000; Han el et al, 
1991).   
CPX has demonstrated in vivo and/or in vitro anticancer activity in at least 17 types of solid tumor and hematologic cancers ( CPX-POM Investigators Brochure, 2017).  CPX modulates 
iron-dependent enzymes and signaling pathways resulting in inhibition of cell growth, 
proliferation , and survival.  CPX has been demonstrated to chelate intracellular iron in 
human cancer cells ( Kwong et al, 2015; Eberhard et al,  2009; Sidarovich  et al, 2015), which 
plays an important role in cancer cell death resulting from exposure to CPX ( Clement et al, 
2002; Szüts  and Krude, 2004; Eberhard et al, 2009; Sidarovich et al, 2015).  CPX exposure 
altered expression of 54 proteins in stem cells, including those associated with nucleotide binding, biosynthetic processes, gene expression, regulation of transcription, cell cycle processes, RNA and messenger RNA ( mRNA) processing, and embryonic development 
(Dihazi et al, 2011). 
CicloMed is aware of 2 published report s of CPX-O administered orally to humans ( Minden 
et al, 2014 ; Kellner et al, 1981).  Following oral administration of CPX- O to patients with 
refractory hematologic malignancies, evidence of pharmacodynamic (PD) activity was 
observed ( Minden et al, 2014; Song et al, 2011 ).  Administration by [CONTACT_451684], however, is not feasible because of dose- limiting gastrointestinal toxicity and 
poor oral bioavailability due to high first pass effect ( Minden et al, 2014 ).   
CicloMed LLC    Clinical Protocol  
CPX-POM   CPX-POM-002, Version 1.[ADDRESS_575892] to CPX and CPX- O, 
CPX-POM has high water solubility and is readily formulated for parenteral administration.   
Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in laboratory animals showed that CPX- POM is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_451656], CPX, which then disappears from plasma 
following systemic administration of CPX -POM.  Following systemic administration of 
CPX-POM, the dose is eliminated from the body via renal clearance of CPX and the inactive glucuronide metabolite of CPX (CPX -G).   
In rats, intravenous (IV) CPX -POM administered for [ADDRESS_575893] dose level tested (50 mg/kg/day).  Test item-related transient clinical signs, including slight to moderate decreased activity, increased 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], eating -like behavior, and slight to moderate incoordination were noted 
immediately after dosing at 50 mg/kg/day.  The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats was 25 mg/kg/day in males and 50 mg/kg/day in females.  
In dogs, CPX-POM administered for 28 consecutive days did not cause mortality or changes 
in body weight, food consumption, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, or organ weights.  There were no test item -related 
findings grossly or microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_451657] 30 mg/kg/day.  Test item -related 
transient clinical signs such as salivation, fecal changes, aggression, shaking, and tremors were noted after dosing at the highest dose level tested on the study (30 mg/kg/day).  Convulsion was apparent in one dog on a single occasion.  Test -item related ophthalmic 
changes were noted in 3/10 dogs treated with 30 mg/kg/day.  Thus, the NOAEL in dogs was 
determined to be 10 mg/kg/day and the highest non-serious toxic dose (HNSTD) in the dog 
was determined to be 30 mg/kg.   
The first study of CPX -POM in patients (Study CPX -POM-001) has been initia ted.  A total 
of [ADDRESS_575894] therapy were  enrolled in the Dose Escalation cohorts, 6 males and 13 females 
ranging in age from 20 to 86 years.  The starting dose of CPX- POM was 30  mg/m
2 
administered once per day on Days 1 to 5 of each 21- day cycle.  Doses were escalated per 
protocol up to 1200 mg/m2.  The number of cycles of CPX- POM administered ranged  from 
1 to 6 per patient (mean = 2.5 cycles).  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined 
to be 900 mg/m2, which was administered to a total of 6  patients.  The safety, dose tolerance, 
PK, and PD of IV CPX-POM, administered at the MTD over 20 minutes are currently being 
characterized in an expansion cohort of 12 patients with  muscle invasive bladder cancer 
scheduled for cystectomy.    
CicloMed LLC    Clinical Protocol  
CPX-POM   CPX-POM-002, Version 1.0 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 18 CPX-POM was well tolerated up to the MTD of 900 mg/m2.  At the MTD, all of the related 
adverse events ( AEs) were Grade [ADDRESS_575895] 
frequently reported treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs), reported by 6 and 8 
patients, respectively, and were more common in the higher dose cohorts.  The primary dose 
limiting toxicity was central nervous system ( CNS)-related side effects, in particular a drug -
related serious adverse event ( SAE) of Grade 3 confusion in the 1200 mg/m2 cohort, which 
was considered a dose limiting toxicity, and 4 AEs of Grade 1 confusion in the 600 and 900 mg/m
2 cohorts (i.e., 2 reports in each cohort).  In the Nervous System system organ class 
(SOC), amnesia, dizziness, headache, and somnolence were also reported by 2  patients each.  
One patient in the 30 mg/m2 dose cohort died during the study as a result of an SAE of 
pneumonia, which started on Study Day 28 and was considered not related to CPX- POM 
treatment.   
During the Study CPX- POM-001 Dose Escalation Cohorts, CPX- POM injections were 
completed over a 10-minute period.  During the present study, injections  will be comp leted 
over a 20-minute period.  Slowing the speed of CPX-POM injection may reduce the 
frequency and severity of CNS- related side effects such as confusion and infusion -related 
reactions.  
There was n o evidence of corrected QT interval ( QTc) prolongation or other ECG 
abnormalities in any patient receiving CPX-POM doses up to 1200 mg/m2.   
CPX-POM was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_451658].  Plasma CPX -POM 
concentrations were observed in patients, however, concentrations declined rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], falling 
below the lower limits of the assay within 2 hours.  CPX- POM was not detected in urine. 
Analysis of PK data showed that systemic exposure to CPX increased  proportionately with

hours across the dose range studied.  There was relatively low overall variability (<30%) in 
systemic clearance among individual patients.  There was no indication of accumulation over the 5 days of CPX-POM dosing (mean area under the concentration -time curve at steady 
state (AUC
ss)/initial area under the concentration -time curve ( AUCi) = 1.03).  At the MTD, 
approximately 8.5% of the CPX- POM dose was excreted as CPX .  The mean urine 
concentrations of CPX over 24 hours were >200 µM at the MTD.  
2.2. Background on Bladder Cancer and Rationale  for the Study  
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and mechanism s of action of CPX -
POM in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent, untreated or intravesical treatment 
completed >[ADDRESS_575896] common solid tumor in the [LOCATION_002] with an estimated 
80, 479 new cases and 17,670 deaths in 2019 ( American Cancer Society, 2019 ).  In 2016, 
there were an estimated 699,450 people living with this disease in the [LOCATION_002] ( Siegel et 
al, 2019).  The disease has a high risk of recurrence as well as progression, thus requiring 
CicloMed LLC    Clinical Protocol  
CPX-POM   CPX-POM-002, Version 1.[ADDRESS_575897] expensive cancer s to treat on a 
per-patient-lifetime-basis (Botteman et al, 2003 ; Yeung et al, 2014).  While t he overall 5-year 
survival rate for bladder cancer is 77%, in those with advanced disease, this rate can be as 
low as 4% ( NCI SEER Cancer Stat Facts, 201 9).  
Bladder cancer is defined as two diseases, each with different treatment approaches as well 
as outcomes.  Seventy percent or more of newly diagnosed patients have non- muscle 
invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) which is generally considered less life -threatenin g than 
muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) ( Heney, 1992).  However, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_451660] (Bacillus Calmette -Guérin [BCG]) or 
chemotherapy (e.g., mitomycin C, gemcitabine), 60  to 70% of those with NMIBC will recur 
and 20 to 30% will progress to MIBC (Aldoursari and Kassouf, 2010), where the gold 
standard treatment is radical cystectomy ( RC) coupled with cisplatin -based chemotherapy in 
either neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings ( Milan-Rodriguez et al, 2000).  It is estimated, 
however, that as many as 40 to  50% of MIBC patients are ineligible for cisplatin 
chemotherapy due to impaired renal function ( Dash et al, 2006).  Patients with impaired 
performance status ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ ECOG] >1), heart failure ( New 
York Heart Association [ NYHA] class ≥III), grade ≥2 hearing loss, and/or grade ≥2 
neuropathy are also ineligible for cisplatin -based chemotherapy.  Given the poor complete 
response rate associated with neoadjuvant carboplatin and gemcitabine ( Peyton et al, 2018), 
cisplatin-ineligible MIBC patients go straight to RC or enroll in clinical trials.  
CPX, the active metabolite of CPX-POM, has been shown to be active against both MIBC and NMIBC in vitro.  In vivo, CPX- POM treatment of mice with established bladder tumors 
induced by N -butyl-N- (4-hydroxybutyl)- nitrosamine (BBN) resulted in robust antitumor 
activity.  More importantly, CPX has been shown to have inhibitory activity against the 
Notch signaling pathway. Notch overexpression is associated with bladder cancer cell growth 
and survival.  Inhibition of Notch may be an important target for the control of bladder cancers.  Finally, currently available agents are administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_451661].  Approximately 50% of NMIBC cases will recur within 12 months and 25% will progress to MIBC.  CPX -POM affords an opportunity to develop a targeted, 
systemically administered therapy for NMIBC patients who are at risk of progressing to MIBC as well as a neoadjuvant treatment for MIBC in cisplatin -ineligible patients.  
CPX-POM potentially has several major advantages over CPX and CPX -O in the context of 
treatment for bladder cancer: 1) CPX -POM represents a composition of matter patentable 
invention; 2) CPX- POM possesses much improved physical and chemical properties that  
enable injectable formulation development; 3) by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_451662]-POM, CicloMed hopes to avoid the dose- limiting gastrointestinal toxicities and poor 
oral bioavailability observed following oral CPX- O administration; 4) CPX -POM is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_451663], which is eliminated in the urine as a glucuronide conjugate; 5) elevated beta-glucuronidase activity in the urine of bladder cancer patients has the potential to

CPX-POM   CPX-POM-002, Version 1.0 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 20 hydrolyze the conjugate back to CPX and thereby [CONTACT_451685][INVESTIGATOR_2130]; and 6) CPX -POM administered systemically has the potential to deliver 
drug to the entire urinary tract (i.e., to treat upper urinary tract diseas e), as opposed to agents 
delivered by [CONTACT_451686]. 
The Investigator’s Brochure provides further details of the nonclinical studies and published 
clinical evaluations of CPX -POM (CPX-POM Investigator’s Brochure, 2019).

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 21 3. OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective is:  
• To characterize the safety and dose tolerance of CPX -POM administered as 
900 mg/m2 IV by 20-minute IV infusion once daily for 5 days to patients with newly 
diagnosed or recurrent bladder tumors who will be scheduled to undergo transurethral 
resection of a bladder tumor (TURBT ) 
The secondary objectives are: 
• To determine the number of patients with treatment- related AEs  
• To elucidate mechanisms of CPX -POM action on bladder tumor tissues employing an 
unbiased approach, using ribonucleic acid sequencing (whole transcriptome shotgun 
sequencing, RNA- seq) and chromatin immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_332] -DNA sequencing 
(ChIP-seq) 
• To determine the change in bladder tumor tissue cell proliferation , Notch and Wnt 
cell signaling pathways , as well as bladder tumor tissue CD8+ tumor -infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TIL) via immunohistochemistry 
• To determine bladder tumor tissue -to-plasma and tissue -to-urine CPX concentration 
ratios 
The exploratory objective is: 
• To determine urine ß -glucuronidase activity

4.1. Overall Design 
This will be an open- label study to determine the safety, dose tolerance, PK , and PD of 
CPX-POM in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent, untreated or intravesical  treatment 
completed >6 months before the current diagnosis, resectable tumors.  Approximately 
12 patients will be enrolled and treated with 900 mg/m2 CPX-POM administered IV over 
[ADDRESS_575898] CPX -POM dose on Day 1, pre-dose blood (plasma) and 
urine (clean catch) samples will be collected.  At the time of TURBT on Day 5, one 3- mL 
blood (plasma) sample and a urine specimen will be collected for measurement of CPX -POM 
concentrations.  
Patients will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_575899] dose of CPX -POM for safety.  
4.2. Rationale for Study Design 
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and dose tolerance as well as 
investigate the mechanisms of action of CPX -POM in patients with  newly diagnosed or 
recurrent, untreated  or intravesical  treatment completed >6 months before the current 
diagnosis, resectable tumors, after administration of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) 
to the target patient population.  The patient population selected will have pre- dose tumor 
samples obtained by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-office cystoscopy available and will be scheduled for TURBT, and 
therefore will not need to undergo additional, study- specific, invasive procedures.  
4.3. Dose Selection  
The dose planned for administration to patients in this study is t he MTD and RP2D that was 
determined during Study CPX -POM-001:  900 mg/m

6.1.7. Accountability  
The investigator or designee (i.e., pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate 
accountability of all used and unused investigational medicinal product, placebos, and comparators.  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of investigational product (quantity and condition), patient dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product.  Dispensing records will document quantities received from CicloMed and quantities administered to patients, including lot number, date dispensed/administered, 
patient identifier number, and the initials of the person dispensing/administering the 
medication.  
At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with CicloMed requirements.  Drug may be returned or destroyed on an ongoing basis during the 
study, if appropriate.  At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by [CONTACT_2037], the study site will dispose of and/or destroy all unused investigational medicinal product supplies, including empty containe rs, according to these procedures.  If the 
site cannot meet CicloMed’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be made between the site and CicloMed or its representative for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. 
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by

PATIENT  DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
In the event of discontinuation of CPX -POM, every effort should be made to complete the 
assessments that are scheduled for the Follow-up/Early Termination visit.  See the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1) for data to be collected at the time of early termination . 
7.2. Patient Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, 
or administrative reasons.   The patient will be withdrawn before any CPX- POM treatment is 
administered if the in -office cystoscopy fails to confirm bladder tumor. 
If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a patient withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 
If a patient withdraws prematurely from the trial for any reason, study staff should make 
every effort to complete the full set of evaluations scheduled for the  Follow-up/Early 
Termination visit.  See the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) for data to be collected at the 
time of early termination . 
7.3. Lost to Follow Up

8.1. Safety Assessments  
8.1.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition s 
Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.  
AEs also include the following: 
• Pre- or post-treatment complications that occur as a result of protocol mandated 
procedure (e.g., such as venipuncture, biopsy) during or after S creening (before the 
administration of study investigational medicinal product).  
• Any pre-existing condition that increases in severity, or changes in nature during or as a 
consequence of the study investigational medicinal product phase of a human clinical 
trial, will also be considered an AE. 
• Complications and termination of pregnancy (see Section 8.1.2 for additional 
information) 
• All AEs that occur from the study screening visit onwards and throughout the duration of the study, including the follow -up off study medication period should be recorded as an 
AE. 
An AE does not include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion) 
performed; t he condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. 
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before  
the screening visit that  do not worsen.  
• If progression of underlying malignancy is clearly consistent with the suspected progression of the underlying cancer as defined by [CONTACT_8225] ( RECIST) 1.1, or with clinical symptoms (clinical progression), it should 
not be reported as an AE/ SAE.  Similarly, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451666]. 
CicloMed LLC    Clinical Protocol  
CPX-POM   CPX-POM-002, Version 1.0 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 34 • Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89783], social  and/or convenience admissions) . 
• Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date 
before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol- associated procedure is not 
an AE.  It is considered to be pre-existing and should be documented on the medical 
history case report form ( CRF). 
• Uncomplicated pregnancy. 
• An induced elective abortion to terminate a pregnancy without medical reason. 
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE.  However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy  may be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition 
of an AE or SAE.  
Serious Adverse Event  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e .g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death 
due to progression of disease). 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medial occurrence that, at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening.  The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an 
event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to 
an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329887] (usually involving at least an 
overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serio us. When in doubt as 
to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
• Results in persistent disability/incapacity.  The term disability means a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such a s 
uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

CPX-POM   CPX-POM-002, Version 1.0 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 35 • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received 
investigational medicinal product.  
• Other situations.  Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] b ut may 
jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.  Examples of important medical  events include invasive or malignant 
cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse E vent and Serious 
Adverse Event Information  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) 
through the Follow-up visit (28 +/- [ADDRESS_575911] dose of study drug).   
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF not the AE section. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE after conclusion of the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the patient  is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Event s 
Prompt notification (within [ADDRESS_575912] time a site team member is made aware of 
the event) by [CONTACT_29532] a SAE is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of patients and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
CicloMed LLC    Clinical Protocol  
CPX-POM   CPX-POM-002, Version 1.0 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 36 Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and investigators. 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then 
file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Procedures 
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.   The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the 
CRF. 
It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_113502]’s medical records in 
lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page.  There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_451667].  In this case, all patient identifiers, with the exception of the patient  number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_346590].  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or their designee within 24 hours from 
the time any  site team member is made aware of the event .  The investigator will submit any 
updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.  If any part of the source providing details of the event is not available, the Investigator will submit the SAE with as much information as he/she has at the time of the reporting requirements.  
Contacts and procedures for SAE reporting can be found in the Study Procedures Manual.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between CPX-POM and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE as follows:  
• There is a "reasonable possibility" of a relationship between the CPX -POM and the AE.  
This conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
CicloMed LLC    Clinical Protocol  
CPX-POM   CPX-POM-002, Version 1.0 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 37 • There is not a “reasonable possibility” of a relationship between CPX -POM and the AE. 
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  Alternative causes, 
such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated.  The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) in his/her assessment.  
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor or contract research organization 
(CRO). However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of 
causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor or CRO.  The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causal ity assessment.  
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.   
The relationship to study procedures (e.g., invasive procedures such as venepuncture or biopsy) should also be assessed using the following considerations: 
• There is a reasonable possibility that t he AE occurred as a result of protocol-mandated 
procedures such as venipuncture or biopsy. 
• There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE occurred as a result of a protocol -
mandated procedure.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity  (Grade) for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study, using as a guide the NCI CTCAE, as provided in the Study Procedures 
Manual.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_451692]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as pos sible. This 
may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.

While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study patients, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Male Patients with Partners who Become Pregnant 
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male patient’s female 
partner who becomes pregnant while the male patient is in this study. This applies only to male patients who receive CPX-POM. 
After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy.  The female 
partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.  Information on the 
status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor.  Generally, the follow -up 
will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.  Any termination 
of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Female Patients who Become Pregnant  
The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female patient  who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study.  Information will be recorded on the appropriate 
form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a patient 's pregnancy. The

10.2. Study Oversight  
10.2.1. Data Quality Assurance 
All patient data relating to the study will be recorded in a printed or electronic CRF unless 
transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically ( e.g., laboratory data).   The investigator 
is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by [CONTACT_18027] .  
The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in  the CRF.  
The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory 
agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including 
quality checking of the data.  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
into the CRF by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source 
documents; that the safety and rights of patient s are being protected; and that the study is 
being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
10.2.2. Source Documents  
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the patient and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.  
Data reported on the CRF  that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent 
with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained.   The investigator may 
need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. A lso, 
current medical records must be available.  
Definition s of what constitutes source data can be found in the Study Procedures Manual . 
10.2.3. Study and Site Closure  
The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed on a 
rolling basis upon database lock for each site individually or as the Sponsor determines.  
CicloMed LLC    Clinical Protocol  
CPX-POM   CPX-POM-002, Version 1.[ADDRESS_575919] been collected and/or destroyed, and a study- site closure visit 
has been performed. 
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable 
cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_215887]:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines 
• Inadequate recruitment of patients by [CONTACT_093] 
• Discontinuation of further CPX-POM development 
10.2.4. Reporting of Results  and Publications  
CicloMed will fulfill its commitment to publicly disclose the results of this study through 
posting the results on the www.clinicaltrials.gov  web site.   
A clinical study report will be prepared and provided to the regulatory agency(ies).  CicloMed  will ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline for 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH  E3). Note that an abbreviated report 
may be prepared in certain cases. 
Any investigator will submit any proposed publication or presentation along with the 
respective scientific journal or presentation forum at least 30  days before submission of the 
publication or presentation. The investigator will comply with CicloMed ’s request to delete 
references to its confidential information (other than the study results) in any paper or 
presentation and agrees to withhold publication or presentation for an additional [ADDRESS_575920] the following two categories: (1 ) investigator’s 
study file, and (2) patient  clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, CRF and query forms, 
IRB, and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 
The required source data includes at least the following information for each patient: 
• patient identification (name, date of birth, gender); 
• documentation that patient  meets eligibility criteria, i.e., history, physical examination, 
and confirmation of diagnosis (to support inclusion and exclusion criteria); 
• participation in trial (including trial number);  
• trial discussed and date of informed consent; 
• dates of all visits;  
• documentation that protocol specific procedures were performed; 
• results of efficacy parameters, as required by [CONTACT_760];  
• start and end date (including dose regimen) of trial medication; 
• record of all AEs and other safety parameters (start and end date, and preferably 
including causality and intensity); 
• concomitant medication (including start and end date, dose if relevant; dose changes 
should be motivated); 
• date of trial completion and reason for early discontinuation, if applicable.  
All clinical study documents must be retained by [CONTACT_12415] [ADDRESS_575921] approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (i.e., [LOCATION_002], Europe, or Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until [ADDRESS_575922] be notified in advance (i.e. in the case of a Principal

investigator for archival oversight or if the files are to be moved, this change will be noted in a memo, the Sponsor will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], and the IRB will be notified depending on the IRB requirements.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and  
CicloMed  to store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned 
sealed to the investigator in case of a regulatory audit.   When source documents are required 
for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_69786]. 
Biological samples at the conclusion of this study may be retained in storage by [CONTACT_127026] a period up to [ADDRESS_575923] be completed and signed by [CONTACT_079] 
[INVESTIGATOR_11637]-investigator (as appropriate) within a reasonable time period after data collection.   
This also applies to records for those patients who fail to complete the study (even  during a 
screening period if a CRF  was initiated).   If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason 
must be noted on the CRF .  If a patient is withdrawn from the study because of a 
treatment- limiting AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. 
10.2.7. Inspections  
The investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be made 
available to appropriately qualified personnel from CicloMed  or its representatives, to IRBs, 
or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors. 
10.2.8. Protocol Compliance  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in this protocol. 
10.2.9. Study Discontinuation  
Both the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. 
Should this be necessary, both parties will arrange discontinuation procedures and notify the appropriate regulatory authority(ies)  and IRBs.   In terminating the study, CicloMed  and the 
investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interests.

Detection of histologic feature by [ADDRESS_321537] to 
confirm case elig ibility for enrollment   
OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objective:   
To evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of detection of histological features using WSI under following 3 
sub-studies : 
1. Scans  within scanner  (Intra -scanner precision  substudy),  
2. Scanners  within a site (Inter- scanner precision  substudy), and  
3. Scanners between s ites (Inter- site precision  substudy) .  
ENDPOINTS  
The endpoints are specific to each sub -study: 
• Overall percent agreement between scans  (e.g. between scan1 and scan2 , or scan1 and scan3 , or scan2 
and scan3)  within a given scanner (Intra -scanner precision)  
• Overall percent agreement between scanners (Inter- scanner precision)  
• Overall percent agreement between sites (Inter -Site precision)  
METHODOLOGY  
Pathologists will be asked to identify a particular histological feature present in a field of view (FOV) image from 
the WSI image of a single slide.  The slides will be selected and will contain one particular screened and enrolled 
feature  from an organ at a particular magnification  as listed in  Table 1.  From these images, a TIFF image 
demarking the feature(s) of interest in a particular FOV will be created representing only a small discrete region 
of the entire slide  consistent with field viewed at 10, [ADDRESS_321538] who will be asked to identify the feature(s) in the FOV  from a list of possible multiple -choice 
features.    
Additionally, “ sham ” images of known features will be inserted into the reading deck to reduce recall bias, but 
will not be included in the analysis.  
Then, depending on the sub- study, the slide will be scanned three times on [ADDRESS_321539] -P002   Clinical Validation Protocol for Feature Detection Precision  
 
©[ADDRESS_321540] per site will identify the 
features  in this substudy .  
NUMBER OF SLIDES  
A total of 21 features , 7 features at each of 3  viewing magnifica tions (10x, 20x, 40x), 3 organs within each 
feature, and 6 slides within each feature -organ combination resulting in 378 FOVs . There will be a total of 9  
sham features,  3 at each of 3 viewing magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x), and [ADDRESS_321541].

DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
Hamamatsu S360 MD NanoZoomer Slide Scanner Digital Pathology System (NanoZoomer) is an automated 
digital slide creation, viewing, and management system.   The Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360 MD Digital Slide 
Scanner creates diagnostic quality WSI digital images of glass slides containing formalin -fixed paraffin 
embedded (FFPE) tissue. Each image typi[INVESTIGATOR_264513], creating a digital image of the tissue on the original glass slide. The NanoZoomer captures digital images of entire slides  for duplication, 
annotation, storage, retrieval, image sharing and viewing to permit the pathologist to make a primary diagnosis 
without needing to view those glass slides through a light microscope.
 
STATISTICAL METHODS  
1. Intra Scanner  Subs tudy 
Each  of [ADDRESS_321542] of the  slides 3 times  for each reader  (in such a way that at the end of this 
sub-study, all 378 study slides will be scanned by [CONTACT_264532] 378 slides will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_30783], detail s are given in section 8.1). Three reading pathologist will  evaluate all scanned slides  across 3 
reading sessions .  In addition to 378 study FOVs selected, 1 62 “sham ” FOVs of the different features will be 
selected per the same inclusion and exclusion selection criteria and inserted into the reading of slides battery to 
minimize or avoid bias by [CONTACT_264533], but the results of sham readings will not be included in any 
analysis.

 The number of comparison pairs  is calculated based on 3 readers where for each reader there are 3 pairwise 
comparisons, namely scan1 vs. scan2, scan1 vs. scan3, and scan2 vs. scan3, which results in 3 reader s x 126 pairs 
per comparison x 3 pairwise comparisons =1134.  
To evaluate Intra -Scanner precision for scanner A, three single 2x2 table s can be constructed for pairwise 
comparisons within scanner A and Reader1.  The result of reading  for each slide is “Yes” or “No” if the feature 
was detected  correctly  or not . Each feature shall be considered as of equal importance as the next feature; thus, 
the results of all features will be pooled.  
Nine (9) 2x2 tables will be pooled within scanner A  and across 3 readers to  create a table for scan ki verses scan kj 
for Readers k (k=1,2,3) and i≠j (for i=1,2,3 and j >i). Then the Agreement Rate for each Scanner=(a1+d1)/1134 
and 95% confidence interval ( CI) will be estimated.  
The overall Intra- Scanner Agreement Rate will  be calculated by [CONTACT_264534] 378 slides with selected features enrolled and all 3 pathologists.  The overall number is 378 slides with 
selected features x 3 scanners x 3 readers = 3402.  To preserve the correlation structure of multiple readings of 
the same feature and possibly multiple features on an FOV, the bootstrap method will be used to derive a two -
sided 95% CI for the overall agreement rate.  An FOV will be the bootstrap re -sampling unit.  
The study acceptance criterion is 85% on the lower limit of the 95% CI for the overall agreement rate.  
2. Inter Scanner  Subs tudy 
All same set of 378 study slides already enrolled with selected features and FOVs will be scanned once on each 
of 3 scanners all at the same site . In addition, the same 162 “sham ” slides will be used in the inter-scanner study . 
Three separate reading sessions  will be performed by [CONTACT_264535] [ADDRESS_321543] s (different from pathologists used 
in Intra -Scanner Sub -study  1) with a washout period of at least two weeks between sessions.  The 378 study 
slides that will be read during a reading session will be randomly selected without replacement from the slides 
scanned from 3 different scanners  (details given in section 8.2).  Per reading session, [ADDRESS_321544].   The sham slides are not used in determining precision.  
To evaluate the inter-scanner precision, we need to estimate precision for 3 pairwise comparisons, namely 
scanner A  vs. scanner B , scanner A  vs. scanner C , and scanner B  vs. scanner C .  For pairwise comparison 
(scanner A  vs. scanner B ), three (3) 2x2 tables can be constructed for each of 3 readers . A 2x2 table can be 
created by [CONTACT_264536] 2x2 tables for estimating agreement rate between scanner A , scanner B  and 
scanner 3 . The overall Inter -Scanner Agreement Rate will be calculated similar to one in Intra -Scanner study.  
The study acceptance criterion is 85% on the lower limit of the 95% CI for the overall agreement rate.  
3. Inter Site  Substudy  
In this study, there will be [ADDRESS_321545] only one reading session in which all slides scanned at their site will 
be read.  The order in which the slides will be read at each site will be randomly ordered.  No “sham ” slides will 
be used.  
The overall Inter -site Agreement Rate will be calculated similar to one in Intra -Scanner study.  
The study acceptance criterion is 85% on the lower limit of the 95% CI for the overall agreement rate.

Figure 1. Study  Schema  
2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has emerged as an alternative way to view pathology slides instead of the 
conventional method of viewing slides of tissue under a traditional light microscope used for primary 
diagnosis.  There is growing adoption of the use of WSI for primary diagnosis in many countries (1-4).  
WSI is  particularly  advantageous for remote consultation where pathologist s are not available over vast 
geographical regions, and for easier archiving of images of slide material that may have longer shelf life 
in digital form.  In the United Sta tes (US), WSI is increasingly used for teaching , archiving , consultation , 
and research .  Furthermore,  the College of American Pathologist s (CAP) has published recommendations 
to pathologists who wish to validate WSI in their clinical practices (5 ).  
However, quite recently, in a clearance letter ( 6) and device  summary ( 7), the Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA) has announced the approval of the Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PI[INVESTIGATOR_58027]) fo r 
use of WSI for primary diagnosis, specifically permitting WSI for in-vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the 
pathologist to review and interpret digital images of surgical pathology slides  prepared from formalin -Reading/Feature

 fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, but n ot intended for use with frozen section, cytology, or non-
FFPE hematopathology specimens.  
Thus, with the clearance of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_264514] f or primary diagnosis, this allows  the PI[INVESTIGATOR_264515] a predicate device for any future 510(k ) submissio ns for WSI system s seeking clearance for 
intended use of WSI, and, further, the FDA has indicated that a clinical study to prove repeatability and 
reproducibility of histological feature detection by [CONTACT_264537] a “special control” required to 
acquire that clearance.  
Presently, Hamamatsu is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a digital slide scanner system, the NanoZoomer S360 MD Digital 
Slide Scanner System (NanoZoomer), for the same intended use as the PI[INVESTIGATOR_264516].  Thus, Hamamatsu 
will make the submission in the form of a 510(k) premarket notification with understanding that the PI[INVESTIGATOR_264517], will accordingly adhere to the special controls that are established , and, in 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_264518] “substantial equivalence, ” will follow similar study designs t o test the Hamamatsu system.   
Further, Hamamatsu intends to use the data from this non-significant risk study for the 510(k ) submission 
to clear its NanoZoomer system for the same intended use.  
2.[ADDRESS_321547] and interpret various microscopic morphological features in the pathology digital image.  For 
example, pathologists frequently rely on finding mitotic figures and/or necrosis in tumors to hel p them 
make a diagnosis of malignancy.  This ability may vary among pathologists (e.g. , skill increases with 
experience) , between cases (e.g. , simple ver sus complicated biological entities),  and with diagnostic 
image quality (e.g.,  may be easier  with higher resolution).  In general, the r eproducibility of feature 
recognition and related accuracy of diagnosis in the published literature is poor  (15-23).  
This study is being conducted in order to meet the regulatory requirements for feature detection of the 
Hamamatsu NanoZoomer  S360 MD system.  In particular, the study will determine how well a 
pathologist can repeatedly identify  key histologic features present in a field of view” (FOV) of a region of 
the histological slide at [ADDRESS_321548] will read multiple TIFF 
images of these FOVs from multiple scans across the study.   
There are three sub -studies evaluating the within and between scanner precision as well as the between 
site precision , namely : 
1. Intra -Scanner Precision Substudy 
2. Inter -Scanner Precision Sub study 
3. Inter -Site Precision Sub study 
Recently, the FDA has announced the approval of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_264519] a 
clearance letter ( 6) and device summary ( 7), which included more information on the design, conduct, and 
acceptance crit eria for the reproducibility and repeatability study of histologic features used to acquire 
clearance.   
In light of the clearance of the Philips system, Hamamatsu recognizes that the PI[INVESTIGATOR_264520], that the feature detection precision study is 
required as a special control, and , in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_264518] “substantial equivalence, ” is using this mentioned 
Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Digital Slide Scanner System

 information as guidance in how to design, execute and assess repeatability and reproducibility of the 
NanoZoomer 360MD  system.  
In two PowerPoint presentations ( 8, 9) the FDA has defined that manufacturers seeking clearance of their 
WSI devices for primary diagnosis in surgical pathology must demonstrate that a pathologist using WSI 
technology can achieve reproducible detection of  histologic features.  Those presentations provide only 
some general guidelines regarding the number of features, organ systems, magnification at which feature 
is detected, and number of scanners and readers.  The additional information from the clearance letter and 
device summary provides deeper insight into the approval process for which substantial equivalence must 
be demonstrated  
In the FDA information, three sub-studies for intra -scanner, inter -scanner , and inter -site repeatability and 
reproducibility are described ( 7) and further information is also provide d related to the number of sites, 
scanners, pat hologists, features, organs, magnifications, and examination of a limited FOV for detection 
of features.  In addition, the precision of feature detection is mentioned as a special control for WSI 
clearance ( 6).  
Outside of the FDA released information, further  information is available from ClinicalTrials.gov study 
registration website ( 10) as well as presentations made by [CONTACT_191731] ( 11).  In May 2017, at the Pathology 
Informatics Summit in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA ( 12), Philips presented their features study with the features 
selected, the different magnifications, multiple choice selection of the expected feature, inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for slid es with the desired feature, the limited FOV used for feature detection, and the 
acceptance criterion.  The acceptance criterion was established as the lower limit of the 95% confidence 
interval greater than 85% for overall agreement.  
2.3 Risk/Benefit  
Since t his is a retrospective examination of features from cases already available and archived at the site  
and that will be de -identified , and since there is no determination of diagnosis in this study, there is no 
apparent risk or benefit to the patient whose c ase is being used for the study.  
3. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
3.1 Primary Objective  
To evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of detection of histological  features when using WSI 
under following sub-studies:  
1. Scans within scanner (Intra -scanner Precision) ,  
2. Scanners within site (Inter-scanner Precision), and  
3. Scans between S ites (Inter-site Precision) .

 3.2 Primary Endpoint  
The endpoints are specific to each sub -study:  
1. Overall percent agreement between scans within a given scanner (Intra -scanner precision)  
2. Overall percent agreement between scan ners (Inter-scanner precision)  
3. Overall percent agreement for scans between sites (Inter-Site precision)  
4. STUDY DESIGN 
The features study is designed to assess the precision of repeatability and reproducibility of the 
NanoZoomer  image  system .  Readings of glass slides will not be included in this study.  
Precision of the NanoZoomer  will be assessed in three sub -studies, namely:  
1. Intra -Scanner Precision Study  
2. Inter -Scanner Precision Study  
3. Inter -Site Precision Study  
In the all three sub -stud ies, pathologists will review several slides consisting  of different features (one per 
slide) from multiple organs and from different magnificat ions.  These slides will be chosen to meet pre-
specified inclusion and exclusion criteria.  The pathologist will not be presented with the entire WSI 
image but with a very limited FOV in the form of a tag image file format ( TIFF) image that contains a 
know n particular feature.  The TIFF images with the FOVs will be created from repeated 40x WSI scans 
from different scans, scanners,  and sites, depending on the requirements of the sub-study .  Figure [ADDRESS_321549] -P002   Clinical Validation Protocol for Feature Detection Precision

Figure 7. Communication Between Scanner and Display  
 
The Slide Scanner consists of the following blocks as shown above  in Figure 7. 
• Slide Feeder: The slide feeder is manually loaded with glass slides and then transfers glass slides 
from the slide cassette to the macro scanning position using the mechanical hand.  
• Macro Scan: When the glass slide has moved to the macro image scanning position, the macro LED 
illuminates the slide and acquires the macro image of both specimen and barcode l abel. The scanning 
area is automatically determined based on the macro image.  
• Micro Scan: After acquiring the macro image, the glass slide is moved to the micro image scanning 
position. Then the micro LED illuminates the slide, and focusing points are auto matically detected, 
and the scanning of micro images starts. After the scanning has finished, the glass slide is moved back 
to the slide cassette.  
• Control Board: The control board controls both the micro and macro cameras together with the 
focusing lenses.

 6.2 General Principles of Operation  
The Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360 MD Digital Slide Scanner (Figure 8) creates diagnostic quality 
digital images of glass slides co ntaining FFPE tissue.  Each image typi[INVESTIGATOR_264523], creating a digital image of the tissue on the original glass slide.  The NanoZoomer captures digital 
images of entire slides for duplication, annotation, storage, retrieval, image sharing , and viewing to permit 
the pathologist to make a primary diagnosis without needing to view those glass slides through a light 
microscope.  
The NanoZoomer can be loaded with as many as [ADDRESS_321561] disc.  After scanning, the fully digitalized image can be observed wi th the 
viewing software.  
The computer controls the scanner via camera link and universal serial bus ( USB ) interface.  It also stores 
the images on a hard disk. After the scanning has finished, the images can be displayed on the computer’s 
monitor.  
The syst em software does not have any software application that does automated image analysis to aid in 
computer -aided detection of diagnosis.

 • Coding procedures for features  and organ for the enrolled case  
• Coding procedures for the reader pathologist chose n to participate in the study  
• Storing, securing,  and de-identify ing Protected Health Information (PHI)  for cases selected for study  
• Use of WSI equipment for scanning and image storage , coordination with IT systems , and vi ewing 
workstation setup and operation 
• Conduct of self-familiarization process  
• Installation and maintenance of an CRO electronic data capture ( EDC ) system at the site 
• Enter ing, storing, and securing data in CRO electronic Case Report Form (CRF)  
• CRO Data management plans 
• CRO Randomization procedures for scanning and reading slides  
• Document and report protocol deviations  and device deficiencies  
• Document and repor ting of other reportable events  
• CRO Manage ment of  data integrity (verify, validate, lock database)  
• CRO GCP requirements  
• CRO GCP monitoring procedures  
Each training event shall be recorded in a training log as to what training was done, who was trained, who 
did the training, where the training was performed , and the date of training.   The training records shall be 
stored in a secure place by [CONTACT_15779].  
Training shall include training of : 
• Entire study staff ( Principal Investigator [ PI], sub-PIs, study coordinator [ SC], EP, VEP, RPs , WSI 
technicians,  and IT personnel) on study protocol  and processes relevant to their part of the study , 
GCP  and human subjects training  
• Coordinator  on proper storage of equipment , enrolled slides  and essential study GCP documents and 
records, eCRF and data records management  
• Technicians on operation of NanoZoomer scanner equipment, how to scan, review, check, annotate , 
and store scanned image 
• EP and Scanning Technicians how to locate feature on WSI fro m coordinates captured on glass,  
create TIFF image of FOV  and processes how to randomize the location of the feature in different 
regions of the FOV , and randomized rotations of the image, and training on what and how to fill out 
the electronic CRF ( eCRF ) for scanning operation  
• IT staff responsible for proper storage and retrieval of scanned images 
• EP and VEP  (site 1 only, Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center) on selection and validation 
of cases and glass slides for feature study, recording of know n feature from glass slide and system to 
record coordinates  where feature was present on the glass slide for later location when making the 
TIFF image from WSI image of that glass slide  
• Pathologist “readers” on the protocol, the study processes, on instruct ions how to operate and view 
WSI s lides for feature detection, and how to fill out the eCRF for each case, and self -familiarization 
process  
The EP and VEP shall follow the same process to select [ADDRESS_321564] -P002   Clinical Validation Protocol for Feature Detection Precision  
 
©[ADDRESS_321565] site (Ohio State University Wexner Medical 
Center) . 
The coordinator and/or EP  shall search the first site’s database to locate cases that may contain glass 
slides with the specific feature from pre-specified organs  as required by [CONTACT_760].   Once the slides are 
obtained, the  cases will be further screened by [CONTACT_264543].   
Then, the EP will locate the known feature on the glass slide and the coordinates of the selected feature 
will be recorded .  Also, the EP shall record if any other secondary features from same magnification 
group listed in  Table 1 are within the FOV  under the microscope view.   
The slide will be scanned immediately to create a WSI image, which shall be a “locator WSI ” used by [CONTACT_264544].   The coordinates 
recorded from this locator WSI will be used to construct the study FOVs for each of the respective study 
scans for that specific enrolled feature.  
Because of the wide variety of cases and features, the EP ma y seek the consult of other pathologists in the 
site’s practice, as long as these other pathologists are not reader pathologists or VEPs.  The Sponsor may 
choose to purchase known cases.  In such a situation , the EP will follow the same procedure for purchased 
slides.  
7.4 Validation of Slides for Feature D etection  
The trained VEP  will review and confirm the choice of slide, feature coordinates, the designated feature 
recorded  and the presence of any coincidental f eatures in the FOV .  If there is a discrepancy of the 
primary feature determination between the EP and VEP, then both the EP and VEP will convene a 
consensus meeting to come to a decision.  If the EP and VEP cannot come to a consensus decision , then 
that f eature/slide choice shall be disqualified from the study.  
The process shall be repeated to select an additional set of slides, labeled as the sham features, which 
follow the same feature selection criteria, but are not used in the analysis .  
For each sham feature 6 slides will be selected from 3 different organs . 
7.5 Storage  of Slides for F eature D etection  
The study and self -familiarization slides, the feature’s known description, and organ, and feature 
coordinate informati on shall be delivered to the SC for safe and secure storage.  
The SC shall :  
a. Collect and store the cases, slides, organ and known feature description  
b. Collect and store log of feature as well as FOV location and coordinates  
Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Digital Slide Scanner System

©[ADDRESS_321566] proper de-identification labels (e.g.,  hide names, numbers, barcodes) on enrolled glass slides 
with a code known only to the SC, and confirm those labels will not interfere with the scanning 
process nor affect the integrity of the tissue on the slide 
d. Remove all patient identifiers and assign coded-names to protect patient privacy   
e. Ensure traceability is kept only at the site, stored in a secure location, not shared outside the practice, 
and kept blinded to reading pathologists  
7.[ADDRESS_321567] it as a protocol deviation, or to 
enroll a replacement slide for an incomplete substudy.  The replacement  slide will be scanned like the 
others in its set, but not for substudies already completed.  
To make the TIFF FOV images for any enrolled slide , the scanning technician (s) shall utilize the locator 
WSI (made at screening & enrollment ) and the sponsor’s programs to create TIFF FOV images of the 
study scans using the originally recorded coordinates.  These locator WSI files will be made at site 1 and 
shared with site 2 and 3 (See Figure 9) 
Figure 9. Steps to Create the TIFF FOV Image  
First, the scan technician shall locate the feature in the study scan WSI image, using the coordinate 
identified from the locator WSI  for that feature. The scanning technician will create a series of TIFF FOV 
images at 10x, 20x , or 40x as specified in Table 1.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_264526], display and driving computer to the end user. The size of the TIFF 
image shall be consistent with the size normally seen at those magnifications (10, 20 or 40X) under the 
microscope.

©[ADDRESS_321568], and/or on a secure 
folder on the Intranet server with secure access known only to the SC.  The reading pathologists shall be 
blinded to the feature information in the study.  
The trained RPs  shall be allowed to conduct a self -guided mock feature detection on a small set of 
training cases in order to become familiar with equipment operation for this study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_38107]’s 
technical staff will be available for discussion of any questions.

occur s. The rotations may be some multiple of 90 degree s only (i.e., 0° [no rotation], 90° , 180°  or 270° ). 
When given the set of TIFF images for that reading, we anticipate that the time to read all images may 
lead to fatigue.  Therefore, the RP  shall be permitted to read images for a period of no more than two 
hours, at which time the RP  must take a minimum on e-hour break before continuing with the rest of the 
assigned readings.  
The SC shall confirm all entries are filled in . The SC , scanning technician or RP  shall record if any 
protocol deviation or device deficiency is observed. The SC  shall report to sponsor  if any such events 
have occurred and ensure the event is resolved per study and institutional procedures.  
Different RPs will be used for each of the three substudies.  
For the first  two substudies: On the first day, each of [ADDRESS_321570] reading (R1) of their TIFF images in a random order with  respect to the scanner (1, 2 or 3) and scan

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
To minimize bias due to recall of FOVs from previous reads, different reader pathologists will be used in 
the 3 different substudies.  
8.1 Intra -Scanner Precision Subs tudy  
This substudy includes one site with three  scanners (called scanner  A, scanner  B, and scanner  C).  The 
random ordering of slides for the study and the sham  slide s is described below.   The 378 study slides will 
be divided equally into three  sets of 126 slides , 42 s lides from each of 3 viewing magnifications  (called 
set1, set2, and set3 ) using stratified randomization and the three sets randomly ordered into six  possible 
combinations (123, 231, 312; 132, 213, 321).  These six combinations create twelve 3x3 Latin Squares. 
One combination of the sets (1 of the 1 2 Latin Squares) will be random ly selected  (say Latin Square 1 
[123, 231,312] as shown in the table below).  Each number appears once on each row and on each column 
and each number represents a set of 126 slides, where each row and each column adds up to 378 slides .

 Assigning 378 Slides to Each Reader:  
Step 1 - For a selected Latin Square  there are 6 possible choices for assigning the rows to the 3 readers.  
These choices are:  
 Choices for Assigning Each Combination to a Reader  
Pathologist  [ADDRESS_321574] number is 
assigned to Scanner C.  For Reader 1 the combination is 231 and the 126 slides in each set is assigned to 
each of three scanners as shown below:  
Scanner  Set 
Scanner A  2 
Scanner B  3 
Scanner C  1 
 
Step 3 - On each scanner the 126 slides will be scanned three times (called iteration1, iteration2, 
iteration3)  with at least six hours downtime (ensuring full cool down) of the scanner between scanning 
iterations  as shown below:  
 
  Iteration   
Scanner  Iteration 1  Iteration 2  Iteration 3  
Scanner A  2.1 [Set 2, Iteration 1]  2.2 2.3 
Scanner B  3.1 3.2 3.3 
Scanner C  1.1 1.2 1.3 
 
Step 4 – From above s canner by [CONTACT_264547] 3x3 Latin  Square can be created for the 
three scanners and three reading s essions for a given reader such that for a given session each set comes 
from a different scanner and a different iteration.  One selected 3x3 Latin Square is given in Table [ADDRESS_321575] -P002   Clinical Validation Protocol for Feature Detection Precision

Total [ADDRESS_321576] 54 different sham  slides 
(18 for each sham feature of a specific viewing magnifications) to  add to  each reading session such that 
all [ADDRESS_321577].   The rotation of the FOV will be randomly 
determined in  90-degree intervals (0° [no rotation], 90°, 180°, 270°) . 
Then the reading sessions for reader 1 can be displayed as follows using Table 3: 
Session 1 reading for Reader 1 is combination of (1.2, 3.3, 2.1 + 54  sham slides)  
Session 2 reading for Reader 1 is combination of (1.1, 2.3, 3.2 + 54  sham  slides)  
Session 3 reading for Reader 1 is combination of ( 2.2, 1.3, 3.1 + 54  sham  slides)  
As can be seen , each element of a given reading session comes from different rows and columns of the 
scanner by i teration table. 
The process described above for Reader 1 will be repeated  for readers 2 and 3.  At the end, all 378 slides 
are scanned by [CONTACT_264548].  
8.1.1 Required Number of S lides  
The precision will be based on three readin g pathologists’ assessments and identification of specific 
histologic features that are observed in TIFF images of FOV of FFPE H&E slides containing a primary 
feature.  The t wenty one (21) study features and [ADDRESS_321578] -P002   Clinical Validation Protocol for Feature Detection Precision

 21 study features x 3 organs/ study feature x 6 FOV/organ = 378 slides, which include selected study 
features and selected FOVs (see Table 4).

In addition to the 378 FOVs selected for  this study, 9 sham features, 3 f or each viewing magnifications 
will be used.  The  number of sham slides is (3 viewing magnifications) x ( 3 features per magnification) x 
(3 organs per feature) x (6 FOVs per organ)  = 3 x 9 x 6 = 3 x 54 = [ADDRESS_321579] of the slides three times; three  RPs eval uate all scanned slides 
across three reading sessions.  Table 5  shows number of comparison pairs for each scanner.

 The number of comparison pairs, that is 1134, is calculated based on three RPs where for each RP there 
are three pairwise comparisons, namely scan1 vs.  scan2, scan1 vs.  scan3, and scan2 vs.  scan3, which 
results in 3 reader x 126 pairs per comparison x 3 pairwise comparisons =1134 (see Table 6) comparisons 
per scanner .

To evaluate Intra-Scanner precision for scanner A, three (3 ) single 2x2 table s can be constructed for 
pairwise comparison within scanner A and Reader1 .  Table 7  demonstrates a 2x2 table for the pairwise 
comparison of scan1 vers us scan2  for Reader1 . 
The result of reading  for each slide is “Yes” or “No” if the  primary feature was detected correctly . Each 
primary feature shall be considered as of equal importance as the next primary feature;  thus, the results of 
all primary features will be pooled.

  Yes No  
Feature is correctly identified using scan1  Yes a b a+b

 Nine (9) 2x2 Tables will be pooled within scanner A and across 3 readers to create Table 8 for scan

versu s scan kj for Rea ders k (k=1,2,3) and i ≠j (for i=1,  2, 3 and j>i).

Then the Agreement Rate for each Scanner =(a1+d1)/1134 and 95% confidence interval (CI) will be 
estimated as shown in Table 9.

Scanner C  a3+d3 1134 (a3+d3)/1134  
Overall  a*+d* 3402 (a*+d*)/3402  
 The overall Intra -Scanner agreement rate will be calculated by [CONTACT_264549] 378 slides with selected study features enrolled and all three pathologists.  The overall number is 
378 slides with selected features x 3 scanners x 3 readers = 3402.  To preserve the correlation structure of 
multiple readings of the same feature and possibly multiple features on an FOV, the bootstrap method 
will be used to derive a two -sided 95% CI for the overall agreement rate.  An FOV will be the bootstrap 
re-sampling unit.  
Above analyses will be performed for primary feature.   
The study acceptance criterion is 85% . The lower limit of the 95% CI for the overall agreement rate will 
be compared to 85% and if the lower limit is greater than 85%, then the study will have demonstrated 
intra-scanner precision . 
In addition to the overall agreement given in Table 9 , overall average positive agreement (APA) and 
overall average negative agreement ( ANA) will be provided with their  corresponding two -sided 95% CIs.  
In Table 8, the percent agreement of scan i with scan j for a positive result is called positive percent 
agreement (PPA) and is defined as 
PPA = a
1/(a1+c1) 
The percent agreement of scan i with scan j fo r a negative result is called negative percent agreement 
(NPA) and is defined as NPA = d
1/(b1+d1) 
When obtaining PPA or NPA, one cannot assume either scan i or scan j is the reference.  Thus, it is 
suggested that a reasonable summary of positive agreement between two scans is an average of the two 
PPAs, and a reasonable summary of negative agreement is an average of the two NPAs.  These averages should be weighted to reflect the different marginal totals that are used when scan i or scan j is used as the 
reference.  Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute  (28) define s APA and ANA as follows: 
APA = 2 a
1/(2a1+b1+ c1) 
ANA = 2 d1/(c1+ b1+2d1)

8.1.3 Statistical Analysis of Secondary Features  
The presence of secondary features in the FOVs is expected to be sparse because the FOV is selected for 
a specific primary feature.  
The objective of the analysis is to investigate the frequency distribution of the absence or presence of the 
secondary features.  Each feature will be considered primary for 18 FOVs (3 organs x 6 FOVs per organ) 
and will be considered secondary for the remaining 360 FOVs  (this  means n 1 of the 18 FOVs in set 1, n 2 
of 18 FOVs in set 2, and n 3 of 18 FOVs in set 3, where n 1+n2+n3=18) .  It is possible that a given feature 
may not be present in the majority of the 360 FOVs.  
The secondary analysis will be based on the repeatability/reproducibility regarding each secondary feature 
separately. To perform the secondary analysis for a specific feature, say feature X , 3 scans (scan1, scan2, 
and scan3) per scanner will be used. In the 3 scans from scanner A, there are n 1 FOVs primary for feature 
X among 126 FOVs and 126–n 1 FOVs secondary for feature X .  Thus, 126–n1 FOVs will be used to 
construct the following 2x2 contingency table.

Nine (9) 2x2 tables will be pooled within scanner A and across 3 readers to create Table 12 for scan i 
versus scan j for reader k (k=1,2,3) and i ≠j (for i=1,2,3 and j>i).

provided as shown in Table 13 for each of the 21 features that appear as secondary features.  In total, up 
to 21 contingency tables, one for each secondary feature, will be provided, based on the 3240 (3402 – 9 x

8.2 Inter-Scanner Precision Substudy  
The same set of all 378 slides with selected features and FOVs will be scanned in this substudy, once on 
each of the 3 scanners at one site and the same 1 62 sham slides will be used in this substudy from the 
intra-scanner study.  
Three (3) separate reading sessions will be performed by [CONTACT_264551] a washout period of at least two weeks between sessions.  Per reading session, [ADDRESS_321582].  The rotation of the FOV will be randomly 
determined in 90-degree intervals (0° [no rotation], 90°, 180°, 270°).  
Sets 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_321583] been scanned, one 3x3 Latin 
Square out of 12 possible choices will be selected  to assign sets to reading sessions, say  
Latin Square 1:  
 Column1  Column2  Column3  
Row1  2 3 1 
Row2  1 2 3 
Row3  3 1 2 
Each number appears once in each row and column. The number refers to a set.  
 
Then combination 231 (row 1) will be assigned to reading session 1 ( RS1), combination [ADDRESS_321584] -P002   Clinical Validation Protocol for Feature Detection Precision  
 
©[ADDRESS_321585] number is 
assigned to Scanner C.  For RS1 each set of the combination 231 (126 slides in each set ) will be  assigned 
to each of three scanners as shown below:  
Scanne r Set 
Scanner A  2 
Scanner B  3

Thus, for Reader 1 a 3x3 Latin Square for combination of Reading Session-Scanner is as follows;

To evaluate the Inter-Scanner precision, we need to estimate the precision for three pairwise comparisons, 
namely scanner A versu s scanner B, scanner A vs. scanner C, and scanner B vs. scanner C.  For the 
pairwise comparison, three (3) 2x2 tables similar to Table 8 can be constructed for each of 3 readers and 
each reading session .  Inter -Scanner precision for each reader  can be created by [CONTACT_264553] (9)  2x2 
tables for each reader.  In addition, the overall Inter -Scanner precision will be estimated by [CONTACT_264554] 
2x2 contingency tables across 3 readers as shown in Table 16.

 The two -sided 95% CI for overall Inter -Scanner agreement rate will be calculated in a manner similar to 
the one provided for the Intra-Scanner substudy.  
The above analyses will be performed for the primary feature.  
The study acceptance criterion is 85% . The lower limit of the 95% CI for the overall agreement rate  will 
be compared to 85% and if the lower limit is greater than 85%, then the study will have demonstrated 
inter-scanner precision. 
In addition to the overall agreement, overall APA and overall ANA rates for inter-scanner precision will 
be provided with their corresponding two-sided 95% CIs.  
Analysis of secondary features will be similar to the analysis described for the intra-scanner substudy (see 
section 8.1.3 ).

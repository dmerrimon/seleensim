1.0 Research Design 
 
1.1 Purpose/Specific Aims 
The purpose of this study is to determine if music is an effective pain management strategy during IUD 
insertion. 
 
A.  Objectives  
This study will determine if pain and anxiety scores are lower in subjects with music versus controls 
without music during IUD insertion. 
B.  Hypotheses / Research Question(s) 
This study hypothesizes that music will decrease pain during IUD insertion. We also 
hypothesize that music will decrease anxiety during IUD insertion.  
 
1.2 Research Significance 
Throughout the [LOCATION_002], long acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods are 
becoming increasingly popular. According to ACOG, 11.6% of women use LARCs, with 10.3% 
using intrauterine devices (IUDs) and 1.3% using the contraceptive implant (ACOG, 2017). As 
LARCs become more common, so should the awareness of difficulties with their insertion. Pain 
is one of the most frequent complaints regarding insertion among LARC users. Compared to 
implant users, more IUD users reported insertional pain (80% vs 18%, p<0.0001) and less 
satisfaction with pain management (72.4 vs 85.6, p=0.04) (Callahan, 2019).  
Very few strategies to minimize pain during LARC placement have been successful. Many 
providers advise women to take motrin or advil prior to their IUD insertion appointment. 
However, administration of ibuprofen prophylaxis prior to IUD insertion has not been shown to 
decrease pain at the time of insertion. (Chor, 2012). Another method that has been explored is a 
lidocaine block. A randomized control trial of 95 women concluded that a 1% lidocaine 
paracervical nerve block reduces pain during IUD insertion compared with a sham block with 
pressure on the vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] (p< 0.001) (Akers, 2017). Other measures to manage pain and 
increase satisfaction with LARC insertion remain largely unstudied. 
This study proposes that music may be effectively used as a pain management strategy. A 
metaanalysis of 97 randomized control trial (n=374) showed music was associated with 
statistically significant effects in decreasing pain, including acute, procedural, chronic, and cancer 
pain (p<0.[ZIP_CODE]) (Lee, 2016). Though no studies have looked at the relationship between music 
and pain during IUD insertion specifically, studies have been done regarding similar procedures, 
such as colposcopy and manual vacuum aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. A metaanalysis of 5 randomized control trials 
 
 
 
 
Protocol Title: Music to Reduce Patient Reported Pain During 
Intrauterine Device (IUD) Placement in the Office  
 
Protocol Version Date: V2 07.06.[ADDRESS_1283758] of music therapy showed no difference in anxiety levels (n=763, p=0.4) or 
pain (n=649) during (p=0.31) and after (p=0.33) colposcopy. (Abdelhakim, 2019). Similarly, a 
randomized control trial of 101 women randomized to undergo abortion with routine pain control 
measures only (ibuprofen and paracervical block) or with the addition of intraoperative music via 
headphones showed that intraoperative music, in fact, increased reported pain (p=0.045) 
(Guerrero, 2012). Due to these conflicting reports, our study aims to explore music therapy as a 
pain management strategy during LARC insertion specifically. 
 
1.3 Research Design and Methods 
 
A. Research Procedures  
This will be a randomized control trial conducted in the gynecology clinic inside Robert Wood 
Johnson University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (RWJ) and the offices of Rutgers Medical Group Obstetrics and 
Gynecology (RMG). A family planning attending alone at RMG or accompanied by [CONTACT_913557] (Ob/Gyn) residents at RWJ will perform all IUD insertions during this study period. 
Patients scheduled for an IUD, either the Mirena® (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system 
52 mg) or Paragard® (intrauterine copper contraceptive), at both locations will be instructed to 
take ibuprofen 30 minutes prior to their procedure. 
 
Enrollment will occur during all weekdays at both RWJ and RMG. Eligible women will be able to 
read and write in English. Exclusion criteria include contraindications to IUD placement: Active 
pelvic infection, pregnancy, known distortion of uterine cavity, Wilson’s disease (Paragard® only), 
breast cancer (Mirena® only). Eligible women will be enrolled if they are willing to be randomized. 
Written consent will be obtained from each participant. 
 
After the consent process is completed, the patients will complete a survey which includes their 
demographic information, if they are currently menstruating, and their pregnancy history while 
sitting in the waiting room. The patient will also complete a 10 point visual analog scale (VAS) to 
report her baseline pain and a State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Vital signs will be recorded 
with an automated machine. 
 
Participants will then be randomized to routine pain control measures or routine pain control 
measures plus music. Randomization will be completed by [CONTACT_5984], who will open 
sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. Allocation will be in a 1:1 ratio. Routine pain 
control will include instructions to take ibuprofen 600 mg 30 minutes prior to the procedure. These 
instructions will be given to all participants. It will be noted whether patients actually take 
ibuprofen or not by [CONTACT_5984]. Patients randomized to receive music in addition to routine 
pain control measures, will listen to preselected classical music played on the PI [CONTACT_648]. Patients 
will control the volume.  
 
A study staff member will be present in the room throughout the duration of the procedure in 
addition to the physician performing the actual insertion of the IUD. This study staff member will 
complete a procedure information sheet including vitals, type of IUD inserted, and the VAS and 
STAI at several points of the procedure (immediately prior to the procedure, point of speculum 
insertion, point of tenaculum placement, point of IUD insertion, and [ADDRESS_1283759]-procedure).

Page 4 of 13 
 
 
Pain scores will be collected on the VAS; anxiety scores will be collected on the STAI. 
C. Study Duration 
Each subject will participate only once during their actual outpatient appointment for IUD insertion. 
The overall duration of this study will be until the prespecified sample size determined based on 
power calculation is reached. This is estimated to take approximately [ADDRESS_1283760] 90% power, two sided alpha 0.05, and a standard deviation of 3, this study required 
at least 48 women per arm . 
 
1.6 Study Variables 
 
A.   Independent Variables, Interventions, or Predictor Variables  
The intervention being tested is music. Patients will receive either routine pain control measures 
only (control group) or routine pain control measures and music (treatment group). Routine pain 
control will include instructions to take ibuprofen 600 mg 30 minutes prior to the procedure. These 
instructions will be given to all participants. It will be noted whether patients actually take 
ibuprofen or not by [CONTACT_5984]. Patients randomized to receive music in addition to routine 
pain control measures, will listen to preselected classical music played on the PI [CONTACT_648].  
B.  Dependent Variables or Outcome Measures  
Pain is the primary outcome measure. Pain will be measured on the VAS. Anxiety is the secondary 
outcome measure. Anxiety will be measured on the STAI 
 
1.7 Drugs/Devices/Biologics  
This study will use two different IUDs which are both FDA approved for this indication: Mirena® 
(levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system 52 mg) or Paragard® (intrauterine copper contraceptive). 
These will be inserted into the uterus by a physician at bedside.  
 
A. Drug/Device Accountability and Storage Methods 
For both RWJ and RMG, the IUDs are stored and secured in the Ob/Gyn department in CAB 
building. At both locations, nursing staff is responsible for preparation of the IUD. At both locations, 
an Ob/Gyn Physician will be inserting the IUD.

1.9 Data Collection 
 
A. Primary Data Collection 
 Location : At both RWJ and RMG, data collection will take place within two main areas: the 
waiting room and the patient exam room.  
 Process of Data Collection : In the waiting room, patients will complete the demographic 
survey. They will also complete, the VAS and STAI for their baseline pain and anxiety scores, 
respectively. If the patient wishes to complete any of these instruments in private, she will be 
led into an unoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_913553]. In the exam room, the providers will complete the 
provider survey regarding the patient. The providers will also record vital signs, BMI, and other 
pertinent medical information. While in the exam room, at several points through the insertion 
the VAS and STAI will be administered.  
 Timing and Frequency : The patient survey will be completed once by [CONTACT_913558]. The provider survey will be completed once by [CONTACT_913559]. The VAS will be completed by [CONTACT_913560]: 
immediately prior to the procedure, point of speculum insertion, point of tenaculum placement, 
point of IUD insertion, and [ADDRESS_1283761]-procedure.   
 Procedures for Audio/Visual Recording : There will be no audio or video recordings of the 
patients.  
 Study Instruments : The patient survey will include demographic information including: age, 
ethnicity, preferred language, marital status, education level, history of smoking, history of 
alcohol use, current medications, allergies, date of last menstrual period, menstrual history, 
exercise habits, current pain level, current anxiety level, history of depression, music interests, 
prior medical procedures, prior medical complications, pregnancy history, delivery history, 
miscarriage history, previous pain management techniques, and preferred method of music 
listening. The provider survey includes heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], body mass 
index (BMI), type of IUD inserted, medical complications, prior contraceptive use, gravidity, 
parity. The VAS is a well known and accepted instrument for quantifying pain. It has been 
used previously to report pain during IUD insertion (Mody 2018). The STAI is also a well 
known and accepted instrument for quantifying anxiety. It, too, has also been used previously 
to report anxiety in several different circumstances (Kendall 1976).

Protocol Title: Music to Reduce Patient Reported Pain During 
Intrauterine Device (IUD) Placement in the Office  
 
Protocol Version Date: V2 07.06.[ADDRESS_1283762]. Glenmarie Matthews is part of the Ob/Gyn 
faculty at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. She is fellowship trained in advanced family 
planning and recently successfully established a Ryan Grant at RWJ. With new increased access to 
contraception through this funding, she has been able to set up a contraception clinic that offers LARCs 
to women. She now seeks to reduce pain associated with IUD insertion in order to continue to make 
IUDs more acceptable and available to her patients. [CONTACT_913565] is an Ob/Gyn resident at Rutgers 
Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. She has been working with the population being studied as her 
patients over the past two years. Providing long term contraception to this population is of utmost 
importance to her. Along the same lines, she would like to reduce obstacles and negative perceptions 
the New Brunswick area population might have about LARCs. [CONTACT_913566] is a biostatistician 
who has been and will continue to be involved in the study. He has completed power calculations to 
determine an appropriate sample size for this study. He will also be extensively involved in interpreting 
the results. Ryan Safarzadeh is a graduate student at Rutgers Graduate School of Biomedical 
Sciences. He is very interested in women’s healthcare, including access to contraception.

C. Feasibility 
In an average month, 20 women are seen for IUD insertion between both sites (RMG and RWJ). As 
the study intervention (music) confers no additional risk to routine management during IUD insertion, 
we anticipate that at least half of these women will consent to participate in the study. If approximately 
10 women are enrolled in the study monthly, then we believe it is feasible to complete this study in 
little over a year. 
 
4.4 Consent Procedures 
 
A. Consent Process 
 Location of Consent Process 
The consent process will take place in private in an otherwise unoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_913555]’s appointment. 
 Ongoing Consent  
Ongoing consent is not required as the patient will only participate in the study for the 
duration of their appointment. 
 Individual Roles for Researchers Involved in Consent  
[CONTACT_913565], [CONTACT_913567], and Ryan Safarzadeh will all be responsible for 
approaching/recruiting patients, discussing the study, determining inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, and subsequently consenting patients desiring to participate.

A. Description of Risks of Harm to Subjects 
 Reasonably Foreseeable Risks of Harm 
Patients who participate in the study will almost certainly have a longer visit. Between the 
consent process and the patient survey that participants will need to complete, it is estimated 
that approximately 20 minutes will be added on to the patient’s appointment. Other than this 
loss of time, there are no other inconveniences or harms that are foreseeable. The study 
intervention of music is not associated with any know harm.   
 Risk of Harm from an Intervention on a Subject with an Existing Condition 
N/A. 
 Other Foreseeable Risks of Harm 
There are minimal risks associated with possible loss of confidentiality. However, since 
patients will be signing the consent form with their names, a potential risk of breach of 
confidentiality does exist.

 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects 
The only people the participants will be providing information regarding the research to will be 
the study staff members and the physician and nurse assigned to her for the visit. This will 
serve to limit the number of people the participant interacts with or provides personal 
information to about the research. In subsequent appointments, their participation in the 
research will not be referenced unless the conversation is initiated by [CONTACT_913563]. 
 
 
F. Potential Benefits to Subjects 
Music has been previously shown to reduce pain and anxiety related to procedures as well as 
related to chronic diagnoses. This study seeks to determine is music has this effect during IUD 
insertion, as well. Patients who take part in this research and are randomized to the intervention 
group are anticipated to experience a decrease in pain and anxiety during their IUD insertion. We 
anticipate that this effect will last for the duration of the procedure and that it will reduce pain and 
anxiety by [CONTACT_3450] 25%.

tumor samples.  
e) Assess the predictive  value of multiparametric MRI in patients with advanced HCC treated with 
systemic therapy and/or Yttrium 90 radioembolization.  
 
Hypothesis: There is a negative correlation between diffusion metrics (D: true diffusion coefficient and 
ADC) and tumor grade/cellularity and aggressiveness; a positive correlation between PF (perfusion 
fraction) measured with IVIM, arterial fraction (ART)  measured with DCE -MRI and each of MVD 
(microvessel density) and VEGF expression; and a positive correlation between ΔR2* (measured with 
BOLD) and each of MVD and HIF 1-α (hypoxia inducible factor 1 -alpha) expression .  
 
Hypothesis: FDG -PET parameters corre late with HCC tumor grade, and may add information to MRI 
metrics.  
 
Hypothesis: There is a correlation between quantitative MRI and PET and certain gene expression profiles 
in tumors.  
 
Hypothesis: Quantitative MR parameters may enable prediction and asse ssment of response to systemic 
therapy and/or Y90 radioembolization .  
 
 
2) Background  
 
The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has recently increased in the US mostly due to an 
increase in chronic hepatitis C infection. Angiogenesis is critical for the growth and metastatic 
progression of HCC, and involves different molecular pathway s including VEGF (vascular endothelial 
growth factor) which is released following a hypoxic stimulus, inducing hyperpermeability of tumor 
vessels. The arterial vascular profile of HCC has provided the basis for the use of transarterial 
chemoembolization (T ACE) as an effective therapy to cause tumor necrosis. Imaging plays an essential 
role in HCC screening, diagnosis and staging. However, the assessment of HCC tumor grade and 
aggressiveness, and the prediction of response of HCC to TACE using imaging criter ia are not 
established. With the development of new antiangiogenic drugs recently approved in advanced human 
HCC, such as sorafenib, imaging methods to predict and assess therapeutic response beyond changes in 
size become critical. It has been recently sug gested that assessing the degree of residual tumor 
enhancement on dynamic CT or MRI using modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria in HCC treated with 
TACE or systemic therapy is more appropriate than the use of conventional RECIST criteria (which are 
based on s ize only).  
Recently, functional MRI methods have shown promising results for evaluation of tumor cellularity and 
grade, angiogenesis and hypoxia. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measured with diffusion -
weighted imaging (DWI) has been correlated with tumor cellularity in brain, prostate and breast tumors 
and with HCC tumor grade , and has been used for assessment of response of HCC to TACE. BOLD 
(blood oxygen level dependent) MRI experiments have demonstrated a decrease in R2* after oxygen or

Revised 6/30/[ADDRESS_1165910] -enhanced MRI (DCE -MRI) has been correlated with tumor microvessel density (MVD) 
and VEGF expression and has been used to follow antiangiogenic treat ments in liver metastases. Our 
recent data suggest that tumor ADC correlates with HCC grade and can be used to predict HCC response 
to TACE; and that tumor perfusion (measured with DCE -MRI) and oxygen uptake (measured with 
BOLD) are promising non invasive markers of HCC angiogenesis and hypoxia. In addition, r ecent work 
by [CONTACT_839095] (intravoxel incoherent motion) model. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_839082], data 
correlating DWI (without or with IVIM), DCE -MRI and BOLD with histopathology in human HCC 
remain extremely limited. Moreover, validated imaging methods to predict and assess early HCC 
response to new targeted agents such as sorafenib are lackin g. 
Intratumoral hypoxia has been shown to correlate with tumor invasiveness, progression, metastasis and 
radioresistance. Given that HCC is a hypervascular tumor, anti -angiogenic therapy offers a promising 
approach, and potent experimental antiangiogenic d rugs such as angiostatin, endostatin, vasostatin and 
TNP-470 are effective in treating experimental models of HCC. Sorafenib ( Nexavar, Bayer HealthCare –
Onyx Pharmaceuticals ) is an oral multikinase inhibitor with anti -angiogenic, pro -apoptotic and Raf kinas e 
inhibitory activity, which has shown small increase in survival in the SHARP trial compared to placebo, 
and is currently FDA approved for use in advanced human HCC.  
There is also recent interest in immunotherapy drugs in HCC , with a trial of nivolumab (Opdivo) opening 
soon at Mount Sinai . Yttrium [ADDRESS_1165911] agent by [CONTACT_839096] (R2*, in sec–1) of neighboring tissues. BOLD MRI technique detects these 
relative changes in R2*. In various murine cancer models, significant changes in tumor R2*  were 
demonstrated when altering concentrations of O 2 administration. Rhee et al demonstrated an increase in 
R2* values after HCC embolization in rabbits.  
DCE-MRI has been used to study tumor pathophysiology and to follow antiangiogenic treatments. With 
the proposed concept of perfusion “normalization” with antiangiogenic therapy, a decrease in perfusion 
and blood volume is expected in tumors, however data on DCE -MRI in HCC treated with systemic

Revised 6/30/[ADDRESS_1165912] paper show ed that high pre -treatment MTT (mean 
transit time) and Ktrans were predictive of better response of HCC to bevacizumab and chemotherapy.  
MRE can be implemented on a standard MR system by [CONTACT_839097] a device for generating mechanical 
vibration in the liver under MR scanner control, a special MRE pulse sequence, and processing software 
to generate the diagnostic MRE images (elastograms). Several studies have demonstrated that MRE is an 
accurate method for diagnosing liver fibrosis, with liver stiffness increasing systematically with fibrosis 
stage. There is limited data on the use of MRE in focal liver lesions. This study showed that HCC and 
cholangiocarcinoma had significantly greater stiffness than fibrotic liver, benign tumors, and normal liver 
parenchyma.  
FDG-PET has been used to probe HCC tumor grade, with increased uptake demonstrated in patients with 
high-grade HCC (102, 103). A correlation between FDG uptake and the number, size and stage of tumors 
as well as portal vein invasion has been demonstrated (104-108), suggesting that FDG -PET can identify 
more aggressive HCC tumor phenotypes . It is now possible to combine functional information from MRI 
and PET by [CONTACT_2329] a whole body hybrid PET -MRI system (109, 110), which may maximize information 
on tumor aggressiveness, which may be in turn used for individualizing therapy (111). In this regard, 
PET-MRI systems may be instrumental for risk stratifying patients, a nd could be used as a preoperative 
tool for estimating the post -surgical risk of HCC tumor recurrence  
 
The validation of new imaging criteria for prediction and assessment of early response to systemic 
therapy or to locoregional therapy with radioembolizat ion will enable individualized therapy, such as 
patients not benefiting from these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839083].  
  
3) Setting of the Human Research  
The study will be conducted at the outpatient Radiology practice loc ated in the Faculty Practice 
Associates (FPA) building or in the Center for Science and Medicine in the Hess Tower at Mount 
Sinai Medical Center. 1.5T and/or 3T FDA approved MRI systems (Siemens or GE)  and/or a 3T 
mMR (hybrid PET/MR, Siemens)  and ARFI ultrasound ( Acuson S3000, Siemens) will be used for 
the study purpose.  
4) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research  
 
Our MR research group has been actively investigating cutting edge MRI techniques for evaluation of 
focal and diffuse liver diseases. There is a large recruitment of patients with HCC at the Tisch Cancer 
Institute located at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM), and the Mount Sinai Medical Center 
(MSMC). Recruitment sources are from the Surgical Oncology group who performs approximately  100 
resections for HCC annually, the Liver Transplant group (who performs approximately 100 adult liver 
transplants a year, including 40 for HCC), and the Hepatology group. The liver cancer program at Mount 
Sinai is structured as a multidisciplinary group  including hepatologists, surgeons, oncologists, 
pathologists, radiologists, molecular biologists and epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543]. For this proposal, we expect to 
recruit 141 subjects over a 5-year period, including patients who will undergo liver resection referred

lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of viable target lesions recorded since 
initiation of therapy.  
• Overall survival:  defined as the time from initiating therapy to de ath.  
 
f) Procedures Involved in the Human Research  
All subjects will undergo 1 to 2 MRI exams  and ARFI . During each visit, we will obtain the following 
MR parameters (DWI, BOLD, MRE and DCE -MRI). Patients referred for MR evaluation of the abdomen 
will receive all conventional MRI necessary to address the referral indication in addition to DWI, DCE -
MRI, BOLD and MRE.   
23 patients will be asked to undergo a single PET/MRI  and ARFI  study. These patients will not be 
asked to come back for a second PET/MRI study.  
We will perform an independent prospective study in up to 30 additional patients with advanced HCC 
treated with sorafenib or nivolumab and/or Y90 to assess the role of pre -treatment and early changes in 
quantitative MR parameters for predicting tumor response, time to tumor progression and overall survival.  
 
Diffus ion-weighted MRI  (DWI) will be performed using multiple single shot Echo Planar Imaging 
(EPI) or segmented EPI [INVESTIGATOR_839085]. Diffusion parameters will be calculated (ADC: apparent diffusion  coefficient, D: true 
diffusion coefficient, PF: perfusion fraction).  
BOLD MRI: Before contrast injection, we will use a breath -hold multiecho T2* sequence covering 
the whole liver under room air and after 20 min. of administration of pure O2 (10 L/min) and/or 
carbogen (95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide) through a facial mask or a cannula.  
MR Elastography:  Will be performed before contrast injection. The subject/patient will be asked to 
perform multiple breath -holds during the image acquisition.    
DCE -MRI will be performed prior and after intravenous administration of Gadolinium chelates using 
a 2D or 3D fast T1 -weighted sequence. An FDA approved gadolinium contrast agent will be 
administered. These include extra -cellular agents such as Gd -BOPTA (Multihance ), a liver specific

agent such as Gd -EOB-DTPA (Eovist), and a blood -pool agent (gadofovesettrisodium, Ablavar). As 
the contrast is circulating through the body the patient will be imaged for approximately [ADDRESS_1165916] injection. The patient wil l hold his/her breath for as long as possible.    
Routine MR sequences  including T1 in and out -of-phase and T2 weighted -imaging will be obtained 
in all cases.  
FGD -PET/MRI : The PET/MRI exam should last approximately 60 minutes a nd will include FDG -
PET, DW I, BOLD with room air and then oxygen, DCE -MRI and routine MR sequences while the 
patients is lying in the same machine. After the injection of 10 -15 mCi of F -18 FDG (0.14 mCi/kg; 
approximately 5 -7 mSv radiation dose), the PET images will be obtained with the patient's arms raised 
to cover between the orbitomeatal line and the proximal third of the femurs. The study length will not 
be increased by [CONTACT_839103], as the image acquisition of PET  and MR images is 
simultaneous.

2. Image quality (resolution, signal -to-noise, artifacts, etc,)  
3.   Suitability for routine use  
 
The total examination ti me including the setup and routine MRI , ARFI with or without PET will be 
approximately 60 -90 minutes. A physician will be present for all studies.  
During the entire MR procedure (both standard and investigational), the investigator or his team will 
remain in contact [CONTACT_839104].  A squeeze bulb or closed circuit video camera 
may also be used.  
 
ARFI  (Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse, Siemens) : ARFI is a new ultrasound machine.  Patients will 
undergo and ultrasound examination of liver with special de vice called ARFI, for which they will be 
asked to lie on an examining table, and  asked to raise their shirt of clothing above the  stomach area. A gel 
will be applied over the skin , and a probe (a small medical instrument ) will be placed on the  skin in 
between the  ribs. The A RFI device stays outside of the  body the entire time. Measuring the liver stiffness 
takes about [ADDRESS_1165917] visit with and MRI and during their second visit with an MRI or PET/MRI.  
If a subject had a liver biopsy, liver surgery or transplantation as part of their routine clinical care, the 
pathologic specimen will be analyzed with spe cial histological techniques (using special stains with 
microscopic evaluation), and final results will be compared with MRI ,ARFI and PET/MRI  results in order 
to validate our techniques.

Additional test: we would like to perform ex -vivo MRI of liver surgical samples  in 20 patients. Exvivo 
MRI involves scanning of samples on the cli nical MRI system for assessment of viscoelastic properties 
(MRE) and other parameters  such as T1, T2 and diffusion . This will help us understand the relationship 
between invivo and exvivo quantification  in the tumor and surrounding liver . The samples will be

➢ Headaches;  
➢ Nausea. 
Less likely, but serious  
➢ Allergic reaction.  
 
Very rare, but serious  
➢ Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)/NephrogenicFibrosingDermopathy  (NFD). NSF is a condition 
associated with the gadolinium contrast agent when there is severe kidney disease. Symptoms include 
tightening or scarring of the skin and organ failure. In some cases, it can be deadly. NSF has not been 
seen in patients with nor mal working kidneys or mild problems in kidney function.  
 
Risks Associated With PET -MRI:  
The radiation exposure from the PET injection used in this study is considered small and is not likely to 
adversely affect the subjects. We do not expect any side eff ects at all either during or after the scan. 
Subjects who receive a FDG injection as part of the study should not be the primary caregivers for small 
children or be in close prolonged physical proximity to women of childbearing age who might or are 
pregnant, for up to 10 hours after imaging.  
Subjects will be exposed to some radiation from the PET.  Radiation is measured in units called 
millisieverts(mSv) . Below is a table showing the radiation exposure from each test involved in the study:

the noise of the MRI scanner. All subjects will be given a call button to push if they need to speak to the 
technician if they feel anxious.  
 
The loss of confidentiality or privacy is possible but all scans will be deidentified and all names, DOB a nd 
all other similar data will be removed using only a code which will be kept in a separate secure location. 
Every attempt will be made that confidentiality or /privacy will be maintained.  
 
7) Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury  
In the event of harm or injury resulting from a subject ’s participation in this study, the facilities at 
Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_839090]/her expense. Financial compensation  from Mount Sinai will 
not be provided.  This applies to patients and healthy volunteers likewise.  
Physicians and nurses at Radiology Associates are available during all studies and other experts 
depending on the harm or injury may be consulted if required .

may not benefit either.  
9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
 
All research data will be stored separatel y from direct identifiers (e.g. name, address, DOB, MRN, SSN) 
that can link the data to a person's identity.  Research data files will be stored using a unique "code" 
instead.  The "linking code file" will be maintained separately.  
The file that links the code to the person's identity (direct identifiers) will be maintained electronically and 
in an encrypted file on a departmental network drive with restricted access to the study team.  
All research data files will be stored electronically in encrypted files . Access to the data files will be 
through restricted view set up by [CONTACT_773152].  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_839106], including subjects’ personal information, fro m the time participants are identified for 
recruitment until they complete study participation. This includes communication when 
scheduling appointments, leaving phone messages and follow -up contact. Records of participation, 
progress and images taken whil e on the study will be kept secure at Mount Sinai.  
All efforts will be made to make the subjects feel at ease with the research situations. They will 
have the opportunity to ask questions and will have ample time to review and think about any 
questions, examinations and procedures in the study. Research procedures will be explained in 
simple, clear, concise language. Members of the research team will be appropriately able to 
approach prospective participants about the study because the potentia l subjects may be eligible 
for enrollment, their physicians have referred them for potential enrollment, and the research team 
is knowledgeable about study guidelines and protocol . 
10) Economic Impact on Subjects  
The subject will incur no extra costs, the scan s that are part of the standard of care will be 
submitted to their insurance and other scan time or scans that are part of the study will be paid for 
by [CONTACT_4530].  
11) Payments to Subjects  
Subjects will receive $40 per visit  for time and travel.  
12) Consent Process  
Subjects will be given the consent form by [CONTACT_839107]. They will be 
given the opportunity to review the consent document at home, discuss it with whomever they like, think 
about the information that has been presented to them and be able to make an informed decision, without 
being concerned or be in any kind of anxiety provoking situation as to whether t hey wish to participate.   
Patients being called by [CONTACT_839108] , or to ask further questions. They will be given time to think about the information that

13) Process to Document Consent in Writing  
In order to document consent in writing the standard PPHS consent template will be used.  
14) Vulnerable Populations  
 
Economically or socially disadvantaged persons are eligible for the study if the Principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_773142]. The study will be carefully explained and discussed with the 
patient.  Any questions that the patient has will be explained thoroughly to both, the satisfaction of the 
principle investigator as well as the patient. We do not wish to enroll any person who is does not fully 
understand what is involved in this study, nor do we w ish to improperly influence any participant.   
In order to protect the rights and welfare of subjects, we will not preferentially enroll vulnerable subjects.  
In order to protect the rights and welfare of subjects, we will provide information to the subjec ts that they 
can fully understand, and similarly write the consent document in a simple manner and language that 
someone with sixth grade language could comprehend.  
Pregnant subjects are excluded from participation in this study because of the possible eff ect of 
gadolinum to the fetus.

4. IDS: If this m odification changes information contained in Appendix B, revised IDS forms need to be submitted to 
the IDS along with the revised Appendix B for IDS approval and signature.  
5. RSC: Any changes to appendix D require review by [CONTACT_138305].  
 
B. Summarize the modifica tion or attach a summary:  
 
    1. Summarize the modification request (what is changing?):  
1) Changing the title from " Evaluation of HCC Response to Systemic Therapy with Quantitative MR I" 
to "Radiogenomics of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Quantitative MRI ". Linking the current GCO 
number, 12 -0124, with the newly approved GCO number, 17 -0269.  
2) We've added radiomics features (based on same MRI acquisition)  to the protocol. The wording 
changes/ammendments are as follows:  
          a) On page 1  under brief summary of research  
          b) On page 1 under objections, objective b now states that we wish to " Correlate mpMRI and   
              radiomics features with gene expression profiles measured in resected or biopsy tumor  
              sample s. 
          c) On page [ADDRESS_1165924] modified to include data and  
              background information that  supports/reflects our aim to demonstrate that " mpMRI ca n 
              address the challenges of  predicting res ponse to therapy by  [CONTACT_839109] -based genomic molecular  characterization ." 
3) On page [ADDRESS_1165925] of multidisciplinary 
specialties that are involved in the liver cancer program here at Mount Sinai and from whom we can 
draw upon for both recuritment and general research assistance.  
4) On page [ADDRESS_1165926] changed the study duration from 3 to 5 years.  
5) On page [ADDRESS_1165927] removed ARFI ultrasound from the exams patients will 
undergo. PET/MRI has been removed from the protocol as well.  
6) On page 5 under study time lines, we state that we " propose to assess response of therapy in a 
subset of 30 patients with unresectable HCC. These patients will be selected when they undergo

treatment with systemic therapy such as immunotherapy (such as but not limited to nivolumab).  
These patients will be imaged before treatment and 4 -8 weeks after initiating therapy. Imaging will 
involve MRI only ." 
7) On page [ADDRESS_1165928] crit eria to the protocol.  
8) On page [ADDRESS_1165929] added that " Up to [ADDRESS_1165930] -treatment MRI 4 -8 weeks after initiation of 
therapy. " 
9) On page [ADDRESS_1165931] added a statement that we 
would like to perform "a n independent prospective study in 30 additional pati ents with advanced HCC 
treated with immunotherapy (eg, nivolumab) to assess the role of pre -treatment and early changes in 
quantitative MR parameters for predicting tumor response, time to tumor progression and overall 
survival. " 
10) On page [ADDRESS_1165932] added that we will perform 
"histogram quantification and image texture quantification (Haralick features) on DWI, BOLD, DCE -
MRI and T1 -weighted imaging ."  
 
 
 
2. Provide the justification (reasons) for the change:  
 
1) The change in title is to reflect a new, pending NIH grant that has already been approved by 
[CONTACT_839110].  
2) The addition of radiomics features is paramount to proving that there is a correlation 
between quantitative mpMRI and certain gene expression profiles in tumors, including 
expression of immune check -points , with a new aim being the c orrelat ion of  mpMRI and 
radiomics findings with gene expression profiles measured in resected or biopsy tumor 
samples . 
3) These additiona l disciplines demonstrate that ours is a lab suited and well -equipped to 
conduct a study of this scope.  
4) The additional time would allow for further patient enrollment and data analysis.  
5) ARFI and PET/MRI will no longer be performed.  
6) We want to vali date the use of mpMRi for prediction of tumor response to immunotherapy 
for patients with unresectable HCC.  
7) iRECIST along with mRECIST criteria will be used to determine time of tumor progression.  
8) A repeat MRI is necessary to demonstrate the inter -reliability of these exams.

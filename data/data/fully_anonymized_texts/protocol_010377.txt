 SYNOPSIS   
TITLE  
A Phase II Study to Evaluate the Effects of Cabozantinib in Patients with 
Unresectable and Progressive Metastatic Pheochromocytomas and Paragangliomas 
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER :  2014- 0081 
CLINICAL PHASE  
Phase II   
RATIONALE  
Pheochromocytomas (PHs) and paragangliomas (PGs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors 
originating in the paraganglia. Approximately 15-20% of these tumors are malignant1. 
Patients with metastatic disease exhibit a decreased overall survival , with only 60% of 
patients still living five years after initial diagnosis2.  Malignant PHs and PGs have two 
characteristics: increased angiogenesis3 and predilection for bone metastases4.  
 
Tumor angiogenesis 
 Approximately 50% of patients with malignant PHs and PGs carry germline mutations of the succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) gene. These mutations prevent oxidative 
catabolism of succinate into fumarate and electron transport through the internal mitochondrial membrane. As a consequence, production of ATP is attenuated leading to activation of  hypoxia- inducible target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factors 
(VEGFs)  and the platelet-derived growth factor beta ( PDGF -β).  In addition, genes 
involved in glucose metabolism such as the hexokinase 2 ( HK2 ) and lactate 
dehydrogenase ( LDH) are also up -regulated
5. Activation of these genes causes abnormal 
and increased tumor angiogenesis, decreased apoptosis, and increased glucose uptake. In fact, 
18F-FDG -PET/CT scan offers 100% sensitivity for the localization of these tumors6. 
Some sporadic tumors exhibit a similar molecular profile5. 
 Bone metastases  
 The skeleton is involved in 80% of patients with malignant PHs and PGs
4. In 20% of 
these patients, the skeleton is the only location of metastatic spread4. Bone metastases are 
usually lytic and blastic, expansile, and associated with increased morbidity and 
decreased overall survival4. Up to eighty percent of patients with bone metastases 
develop skeletal related events (SREs) such as: bone pain, fractures, and cord compression that need radiation therapy and/or surgery
4. Patients experience SREs 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_622649] (median 4.4 months)4. Fifty percent of 
patients who develop an SRE develop a second SRE within a median of [ADDRESS_829088] 1.1, 8 patients (47%) exhibited clinical benefits : 3 patients had partial responses and 5 had prolonged 
stabilization of disease, including 4 patients with extensive skeletal metastases (but not other metastases) identified by
18F-FDG-PET/CT scan. The tumors that responded to 
treatment also exhibited more than 30% reduction in glucose uptake 2- [ADDRESS_829089] found c- MET  receptor gene mutations (unpublished data).  
Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity that targets the VEGF, c -MET, and RET receptors. This drug has been recently approved for 
the treatment of progressive metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma another neuroendocrine tumor
9. Of interest , cabozantinib has also shown effectiveness in patients 
with castration resistant prostate, breast, and renal cell c arcinomas metastatic to the 
skeleton10, 11, 12. Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of MET and VEGFRs by 
[CONTACT_622663] a broad spectrum of antineoplastic activity and prevent tumor resistance in patients with malignant PHs and PGs.  
 
 
 TARGET POPULATION 
Patients with malignant PHs and PGs have metastases into visceral organs and/or 
the skeleton. Depending on metastases location, the patients can be classified as follows:  
1. 40% of the patients have only visceral involvement (liver, lungs, lymph 
nodules) 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
4 
 2.  40% have visceral and bone metastases  
3.  20% have bone metastases only.  
 
Based on this information, we will divide our study population in two different branches:   
1. Main branch: 14 patients with measurable disease (+/ - bone metastases)  
2. Exploratory branch: 8 patients with bone metastases only  (+/- small non-
measurable lesions) .

 INVESTIGATIONAL REGIMEN DOSE/ROUTE/DURATION  
Cabozantinib initiation dose is 60 mg daily by [CONTACT_622668] 20-mg and 60-mg tablets.  
COMBINATION DRUG(S)  
None  
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Safety  will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Laboratory testing  (chemistry, 
hematology tests) will be performed every [ADDRESS_829112] 8 weeks followed 
by [INVESTIGATOR_300395] 4 weeks  until week 24, then every 8 weeks through week 
52, then every 12 weeks. Other safety evaluations including EKGs and urinalysis 
will be performed at regular intervals.  
Adverse event seriousness, severity grade, and relationship to study treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_093]. Severity grade will be defined by [CONTACT_29630] (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0. 
TUMOR ASSESSMENTS  
Tumors will be assessed with radiographic studies at baseline and every two 
months through week 52, and then every 12 weeks: 
For patients with measurable visceral metastases CT scans with contrast or 
MRI are required. Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that 
can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_829113], MRI or caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461]; or greater 
than or equal to [ADDRESS_829114] or 
MRI.  
For patients with only bone metastases (Exploratory branch) FDG-
PET/CT scan is the only radiographic test required for follow -up. FDG-
PET/CT assessment will include standard assessment of SUV
max, as well 
as advanced volumetric measures including SUV peak, metabolic tumor 
volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) 
 
PHARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS  
None.

[ADDRESS_829115] baseline measurements of resting 
plasma metanephrines and chromogranin A. Approximately 60% of patients with malignant pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas experience an excessive 
secretion of catecholamines.  In patients with an excessive production of 
metanephrines at baseline, plasma metanephrines will be obtained every two months. Chromogranin A  will be measured at baseline and every two months in 
all patients. We will correlate biomarkers with overall prognosis, symptoms, and responsiveness to cabozantinib.  
 
Translational Research  
1. Deregulation of c -MET can occur via different 
mechanisms, including gene amplification, overexpression, and activation of somatic mutations, autocrine or paracrine 
mechanisms, along with interaction of cell surface 
receptors. c -MET has been found to be over- expressed in a 
variety of cancers including lung, breast, and ovarian. The 
most frequent genetic alteration in MET is gene 
amplification. This amplification has been shown to be associated with a poorer prognosis in certain cancers. The 
exploratory trans lational objectives will explore both c-
MET expression by [CONTACT_622669]. This research will be 
performed in archived tumor samples. 
2. Several symptoms associated with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma such as fatigue and decreased appetite may 
be associated with an increased production of Interleukin -6. 
We will measure c- reactive protein (surrogate biomarker of 
interleukin -6) and interleukin 6 at baseline and every two 
months from Day 1 . We will correlate these markers with 
symptoms (MDASI) and overall response to cabozantinib. 
 
 
OTHER ASSESSMENTS

 STATISTICAL METHODS  
This Phase II study's  primary objective is to estimate the best overall response rate in 
patients with measurable disease.  Response will include RECIST 1.1 CR, PR, 
and SD. With 14 patients, the 95% confidence interval for a 45% response rate 
would be (18.9, 71.1%). For the exploratory objective in the small group of patients with bone metastases, the 95% confidence interval for a 45% response 
rate with 8 patients would be (10.5, 79.5%). We do not include a formal statistical 
monitoring rule for toxicity g iven the established safety profile of this drug.  
 
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as 
mean, standard deviation, median and range. Categorical variables will be tabulated by [CONTACT_622671].  Response rates and their 95% confidence inte rvals will be estimated. Kaplan Meier survival curves 
will be used to estimate survival outcomes.  Cox proportional hazards regression analysis may be used to assess the association between survival and covariates of interest. The Fisher’s exact test or lo gistic regression analysis will be used for any 
binary outcomes. T- tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to compare 
continuous variables. Longitudinal models may be explored to study change over time.

 1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background:  
Pheochromocytomas (PHs) and paragangliomas (PGs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors 
originating in the paraganglia. Approximately 15-20% of these tumors are malignant1. 
Patients with metastatic disease exhibit a decreased overall survival , with only 60% of 
patients still living five years after initial diagnosis2.  Malignant PHs and PGs have two 
characteristics: increased angiogenesis3 and predilection for bone metastases4.  
Tumor angiogenesis 
Approximately 50% of patients with malignant PHs and PGs carry germline mutations of 
the succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) gene. These mutations prevent oxidative catabolism of succinate into fumarate and electron transport through the internal mitochondrial membrane. As a consequence, production of ATP is attenuated leading to 
activation of hypoxia- inducible target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factors 
(VEGFs) and the platelet- derived growth factor beta (PDGF -β).  In addition, genes 
involved in glucose metabolism such as the hexokinase 2 (HK2) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are also up-regulated
5. Activation of these genes causes abnormal 
and increased tumor angiogenesis, decreased apoptosis, and increased glucose uptake. In fact, 18F- FDG -PET/CT scan offers 100% sensitivity for the localization of these tumors
6. 
Some sporadic tumors exhibit a similar molecular profile5. 
Bone metastases  
The skeleton is involved in 80% of patients with malignant PHs and PGs4. In 20% of these patients, the skeleton is the only location of metastatic spread
4. Bone metastases are 
usually lytic and blastic, expansile, and associated with increased morbidity and decreased overall survival
4. Up to eighty percent of patients with bone metastases 
develop skeletal related events (SREs) such as: bone pain, fractures, and cord compression that need radiation therapy and/or surgery
4. Patients experience SREs 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_622649] (median 4.4 months)4. Fifty percent of 
patients who develop an SRE develop a second SRE within a median of [ADDRESS_829121] 1.1, 8 pat ients (47%) exhibited 
clinical benefits: 3 patients had partial responses and 5 had prolonged s tabilization of 
disease, including 4 patients with extensive skeletal metastases (but not other metastases) identified by18F- FDG- PET/CT scan. The tumors that responded to treatment also 
exhibited more than 30% reduction in glucose uptake 2- [ADDRESS_829122] found c-MET receptor gene mutations (unpublished data).  Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity that targets the VEGF, c-MET, and RET receptors. This drug has been recently approved for the treatment of progressive metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma another neuroendocrine tumor
9. Of interest , cabozantinib has also shown effectiveness in patients 
with castration resista nt prostate, breast, and renal cell carcinomas metastatic to the 
skeleton10, 11, 12. Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of MET and VEGFRs by 
[CONTACT_622663] a broad spectrum of antineoplastic activity and prevent tumor resistance in patients with malignant PHs and PGs.

 1.2 Cabozantinib (XL184) 
1.2.1 Pharmacology 
Cabozantinib is a potent inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) 
implicated in tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis (Investigator’s Brochure, version 9, 2013). The primary targets of cabozantinib are MET (c-MET) and vascular endothelia l growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2); additional targets include RET, AXL, 
KIT, and TIE-2. Both c- Met and VEGFR2 are important mediators of tumor growth and 
tumor angiogenesis, and in vivo pharmacodynamic activity of cabozantinib against c- Met 
and VEGFR2 has been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies.  
RTKs regulate many processes including cell growth and survival, organ morphogenesis, 
neovascularization, and tissue repair
14. Dysregulation of RTKs by [CONTACT_147844], gene 
rearrangement, gene amplification, and overexpression of both receptor and ligand have been implicated as causative factors in the development and progression of numerous human cancers.  
The RTK c -Met, encodes the high-affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth facto r (HGF) 
or scatter factor (SF)
14. c-Met and HGF are each required for normal mammalian 
development and have been shown to be important in cell migration, morphogenic 
differentiation, and organization of three- dimensional tubular structures (e.g., renal 
tubular cells, gland formation, etc .), as well as cell growth, angiogenesis, and tumor 
invasiveness and metastasis. Upregulation of MET is found in a wide range of malignancies inclu ding thyroid, prostate, ovarian, lung, and breast cancers, and is 
associated with more aggressive and invasive phenotypes of cancer cells in vitro and metastases in vivo (Investigator’s Brochure, version 9, 2013). c- Met-driven metastasis 
may be exacerbated  by a number of factors, including tumor hypoxia caused by [CONTACT_622672].  
Evidence linking c- Met and HGF as causative or progression factors in human cancers 
include: (1) the overexpression of both receptor and ligand in neoplasms relative to 
surrounding tissues; (2) the correlation of receptor and ligand overexpression with disease severity and outcome; (3) genetic alteration of c -Met by [CONTACT_622673]; (4) introduction of c -Met and HGF (or mutant c-
Met) into cell lines, conferred the properties of tumorgenicity and metastatic propensity on engineered cells; (5) introduction of c- Met or HGF as transgenes into the germline of 
mice resulted in primary and secondary neoplasms; and (6) the inhibition of c -Met or

 HGF function with dominant- negative receptors, antibody antagonists (both Met and 
HGF), and biologic antagonists (e.g., NK4) have reversed cancer- associated phenotypes 
such as motility, invasion and proliferation of tumor cells, and tumor g rowth and 
dissemination in vivo14. Principal investigator u npublished data has shown somatic c- met 
mutations in patients with metastatic PHs and PGs.  
A wide variety of human cancers, including brain, colorectal, gastric, and lung, 
demonstrate dysregulated c- Met activity15, either by [CONTACT_3553] c -Met kinase 
overexpression15, activating c- Met gene mutations and/or amplification16, 17, 18, or 
increased autocrine and/or paracrine secretion of the c- Met ligand, HGF/SF19, 20.These 
alterations have been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, and a high constitutive activation of c -Met has been correlated with poor clinical pro gnosis
19.  
VEGFR2 is the predominant mediator of VEGF -stimulated endothelial cell migration, 
proliferation, survival, and enhanced va scular permeability21. Increased expression of 
VEGFR2, often in combination with VEGFR3, has been observed in the tumor vascular endothelium in most common human solid tumor types, on tumor cells in melanoma and hematological malignancies, and in colitis -associated colon c ancer
22. High VEGFR2 
expression is an unfavorable prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and correlated with triple- negative (i.e., therapy- resistant) breast cancer and poor 
survival. VEGFR2 is highly expressed in malignant PH and PGs

studies anti -angiogenic medications such as sunitinib induced apoptosis of

1.2.2 Cabozantinib Nonclinical Toxicology 
In rodents and non-rodents, histopathological changes associated with cabozantinib administration were observed in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, and adrenal and reproductive tract tissues, bone, and pancreas (Investiga tor's Brochure, version 9,  2013). Cabozantinib tested negative in bacterial and 
mammalian cell genotoxicity assays in vitro. In reproductive toxicity studies, cabozantinib was embryotoxic in rats, produced fetal soft tissue changes in rabbits, and decreased fertility in male and female rats. The carcinogenic potential of cabozantinib has not been evaluated. 
1.2.3 Clinical Experience  
Analysis of safety and clinical responses data in 1311 subjects treated with cabozantinib

24 
 XL184-203, XL184-205, and XL184-301 [cabozantinib arm]) has been performed. The 
data cut -off for this analysis is February 28, 2013 (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 
2013). A summary of this analysis is presented here. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Summary  
Phase I Studies  
Study XL184 -001 was a phase 1 dose-escalation study in subjects with advanced solid 
tumors. Eighty -five subjects, across 13 dosing levels (DL) ranging from 0.08 mg/kg daily 
(using powder- in-bottle [PIB] suspension on a 5 days on, 9 days off schedule) to 265 
daily using t he suspension formulation The capsule MTD was determined to be 175 mg 
daily25. Of the 35 subjects with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and measureable disease 
enrolled in the dose expansion phase (MTC enrolled throughout the study), 10 (29%, 
95% CI) ha d confirmed partial responses ( PR) (with a duration up to 48+ months), 17 
(49%) had tumor shrinkage of ≥30%, and stable disease (SD) of at least 6 months was observed in 15/37 (41%) of the MTC subjects.  
In Study XL184 -002, treatment of subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GB) 
consisted of cabozantinib in combination with TMZ with or without radiation therapy. 
Enrollment has been terminated and no clinical efficacy data is presented in the 2013 Investigator’s Brochure Version 9.  
In Study XL184 -008 which was mostly a clinical pharmacology study, subjects with 
advanced solid tumors (particularly renal cell carcinoma [RCC] and differentiated thyroid 
cancer [DTC]) are evaluated for any potential clinically significant drug -drug interaction 
of cabozanti nib on the CYP isozyme CYP2C8. The effect of daily dosing of 175 mg 
cabozantinib and a single dose of rosiglitazone has been  by [CONTACT_622675] a 
single dose of rosiglitazone before and after administration of ≥ 21 daily doses  of 
cabozantinib at ≥ 100 mg/day FBE weight (125 mg malate salt weight). The PK of cabozantinib when combined with a single dose of rosiglitazone was also evaluated . 
Secondary and exploratory objectives of Study XL184-008 were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib and antitumor efficacy in subjects with relapsed or refractory RCC. Twenty -five subjects with RCC were enrolled in the study. Half of the 
subjects had 1- 2 lines of prior therapy with systemic agents, and the other half had 3 or 
more lines of prior therapy. The majority of subjects (88%) had prior anti -VEGF

25 
 anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Of the 25 evaluable subjects at Week 16, seven subjects (28%) 
achieved PRs, 13 subjects had SD (52%), and one subject (4%) had PD as best response. The median PFS was 12.9 months (95% CI: 9.9, not applicable) (data on file). The media n OS was not yet reached with median follow-up of 14.7 months (range: 11.2-21.8 
months). In patients with DTC, PFS has not been reached. A DCR of 73% at 24 weeks has obtained  (Investigator Brochure , Version 9, 2013).  
 
Study XL184 -014 is a phase 1 study currently active in Japan. The study includes 
subjects with advanced solid tumors enrolled in successive cohorts to receive 
cabozantinib administered PO as capsules or tablets in a 3+3 trial design. Subjects are treated with continuous 4- week cycles of cabozantinib administered PO qd. Response is 
assessed on Day 29 and every 8 weeks thereafter by [CONTACT_622676] (mRECIST) v1.[ADDRESS_829123] been enrolled: NSCLC (n = 9); gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 4); 
colorectal cancer (n = 4), pancreatic cancer (n = 2), leiomyosarcoma, duodenal cancer, MTC, and thymic cancer (n = 1, each). Four of five heavily pre- treated subjects with 
NSCLC have had a confirmed PR. Of the four subjects with PRs genetic evaluation revealed that one subject had an EGFR mutation, one subject was RET-fusion positive, and two subjects were ALK fusion positive (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).. 
Study XL184 -202 was a phase 1b/2 trial that evaluated the safety and tolerability of 
cabozantinib and erlotinib administered in combination in non- small -cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) subjects. Of the 64 subjects enrolled in the phase 1 dose- escalation portion of 
the study, al l but two had been previously treated with and progressed on erlotinib 
therapy. A PR was observed in 5 subjects (8%). The ORR for the Phase 1 population was 
8.2% (90% CI: 3.3, 16.5). The median PFS for subjects (mITT Population) was 3.68 months (95% CI: 3.15, 5.49). The Kaplan- Meier estimate of the probability of a subject 
to be progression-free at 6 months was 29.4% (Investig ator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).  
Twenty -eight subjects were enrolled in the Phase [ADDRESS_829124] who was treated with single-agent cabozantinib. The ORR for subjects who received cabozantinib was 6.7% (90% CI: 0.3, 27.9). No objective

26 
 responses were seen in subjects who received cabozantinib + erlotinib (0/13 subjects).  
The median PFS for subjects (mITT Population) was 1.91 months (95% CI: 1.64, 7.06) 
for the cabozantinib arm and 3.94 months (95% CI: 1.54, 7.26) for the cabozantinib + erlotinib arm. The Kaplan -Meier estimate of the probability of a subject to be 
progression-free at 6 months was 30.8% for the cabozantinib arm and 22.0% for the cabozantinib + erlotinib arm (Investig ator Brochure, Version 9, 2013). 
Phase [ADDRESS_829125] or second relapse 
were enrolled to receive cabozantinib daily as a single agent. Group A received an initial 
dose of 140 mg ( 175 mg malate salt weight) (Group A), subsequent cohorts (Groups B 
and C) received an initial dose 100 mg ( 125 mg of malate salt weight). Forty -six subjects 
were enrolled in Group A, and a total of 176 subjects were enrolled in Groups B/C. Study objectives included assessments of safety, tolerability, and clinical activity (consisting of independent radiology facility [IRF]- determined response assessment and PFS), at the 
two dose levels. Enrollment of this study has been completed. Analysis is ongoing (Investig ator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).  
 
Study XL184 -203 is a phase 2 randomized discontinuation trial. Subjects are enrolled 
into one of nine tumor- specific cohorts: breast cancer, gastric/gastro esophageal (GEJ) 
cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, pancreatic 
cancer, prostate cancer, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Eligible subjects with advanced solid tumors receive open -label cabozantinib at starting dose of 100 mg daily 
for 12 weeks. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) at Week 12 and PFS in the Randomized Stage. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) monitored safety in the blinded Randomized Stage. As of October 2011, all subjects have been unblinded.  In [ADDRESS_829126] assessments of 
bone scan improvement were observed in 79 subjects (68%), including complete 
resolution (100% reduction of bone scan lesion area [BSLA]) in 14 subjects (12%) and 
partia l resolution (≥30% reduction of BSLA) in 65 subjects (56%); SD by [CONTACT_622677]
 
27 
 observed in 33 subjects (28%), and PD by [CONTACT_15222] (≥ 30% increase in BSLA) in four 
subjects (3%). Based on a retrospective survey completed by [CONTACT_431], the majority of the subjects reported reduced bone pain and reduced reliance upon narcotic pain medication. There were [ADDRESS_829127] -baseline assessment of pain status. Of these, 56 subjects (67%) had 
pain improvement at either Week [ADDRESS_829128] -baseline changes in consumption of narcotics, 31 (56%) were 
able to decrease or discontinue narcotic medication  (Investig ator Brochure, Version 9, 
2013).  Bone scan improvement was associated with other measures of antitumor effect and clinical benefit. Relative to subjects with either stable or progressive bone scans, more subjects with complete or partial bone scan resolution had regression of measurable soft tissue disease (81% vs 61%), substantial declines in CTx, a marker of bone turnover (62% vs 48%), pain relief (93% vs 35%), reduced narcotic use (72% vs 23%), and a higher rate of PFS at 6 months (56% vs 41%). Changes in prostate- specific antigen (PSA)  
appeared to be independent of radiographic changes  (Investig ator Brochure, Version 9, 
2013). 
Two dosing cohorts, 100 mg (N = 93) and 40 mg (N = 51) once daily, were examined in 
the CRPC NRE. The primary endpoint for the CRPC NRE was BSR prospectively assessed by [CONTACT_622678] a computer -assisted detection (CAD) system. Partial BSR was 
defined as ≥30% reduction of BSLA (Investig ator Brochure, Version 9, 2013) and 
complete BSR as 100% resolution of the BSLA. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as ≥ 30% increase in BSLA.  Subjects with IRF identified measurable soft -tissue lesions on 
baseline CT or MR I scans were evaluated for BOR by [CONTACT_393] 1.1.  
Prospective measurement of subjects’ pain and narcotic use at baseline and throughout the study was obtained by [CONTACT_622679] (BPI [INVESTIGATOR_622650]) over 7- day reporting intervals. Bone scan responses in 
evaluable individuals were observed in 67% (100 mg) and 49% (40 mg) of patients . Soft 
tissue regression was observed in 80% (100 mg) and 79% (40 mg) of evaluable

28 
 individuals.  Pain improved in 67% of patients. This improvement led to a substantial 
reduction of narcotics dose (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).  
 
Study XL184 -[ADDRESS_829129] or second relapse. Subjects received one of four regimens: 20 mg ( 25 mg 
malate salt weight) daily (Arm 1) continuously, 60 mg ( 75 mg malate salt weight) daily ) 
(Arm 2) continuously,  and 100 mg (125 mg malate salt weight) daily for 2 weeks 
followed by 40 mg ( 50 mg malate salt weight) daily continuously (Arm 3), and 100 mg 
(125 mg malate salt weight) daily on an intermittent 3 week on/1 week off schedule (Arm 4). A total of 19 subjects were accrued before the study was terminated. No analysis of clinical activity was performed for this study  (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013). 
Phase 3 studies  
Study XL184 -301 (EXAM trial)  is a blind, multicenter, controlled trial for subjects with 
unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic MTC. In this study,  330 subjects with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic MTC were randomized 2:1 to receive either cabozantinib 140 mg (175 mg malate salt weight) or placebo administered qd in a double -
blinded fashion (219 cabozantinib, 111 placebo). Subjects were required to have documented radiographic disease progression per mRECIST within [ADDRESS_829130]. Enrollment in this study has been completed. Of the enrolled subjects, 323 received study treatment (214 cabozantinib, 109 placebo). In October 2011, the study was unblinded and the data analyzed and assessed for the primary endpoint. At the data cut-off date for the primary analysis of efficacy and safety, 113 subjects (98 cabozantinib, 15 placebo) were still on study treatment. A subsequent 120-Day Safety Report (XL184- 301 Safety Addendum) 
was generated with a data cut -off date of 31 December 2011; at that data cut- off there 
were 73 subjects (65 cabozantinib, 8 placebo) still on study treatment. 
 The median PFS was significantly longer in the cabozantinib-treated patients (11.2 
months) compared with the placebo group (4.0 months) with a response rate of 28% for cabozantinib but 0% in placebo- treated patients. Responses were observed regardless of

 RET mutation status and correlations of radiologic response were made with changes in 
calcitonin and CEA levels from baseline26. Findings from this study led to the approval of 
cabozantinib in the US by [CONTACT_52051] 2012 for patients with progressive, metastatic  MTC.  
Study XL184 -307 (COMET-1) is a  randomized, double- blind, active comparator -
controlled study (COMET- 1), subjects with metastatic CRPC with bone -dominant 
disease who have experienced disease progression on both docetaxel-containing 
chemotherapy and abiraterone or enzalutamide are randomi zed 2:1 to receive 
cabozantinib 60 mg or prednisone (or prednisolone in some countries) in a double-blinded fashion. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of cabozantinib compared with prednisone on OS. No clin ical activity data are currently available for this 
study (Investigator Brochure, version 9, 2013).  Study XL184 -306 (COMET-2)  is a randomized, double- blind, active comparator -
controlled study; subjects with previously treated symptomatic CRPC are randomized 1:[ADDRESS_829131] of cabozantinib on pain palliation in subjects with bone metastases and pain related to bone metastases despi[INVESTIGATOR_622651]; secondary endpoints are BSR and OS. No clinical activity data are currently available for this study  (Investigator Brochure, version 9, 2013). 
 
Expanded Access Study  
 
Study XL184 -[ADDRESS_829132] access to cabozantinib during review by [CONTACT_622680]. Following FDA approval of cabozantinib and the subsequent availability of commercial drug, the study was closed to enrollment, and the remaining subjects rolled over to commercial drug. No analysis of clinical activity data will be performed for this study. (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013)  Maintenance Study  
 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
30 
 Study XL184 -900 is a maintenance study in which subjects from studies of cabozantinib 
given as a single- agent, or in combination with erlotinib or with TMZ may enroll. The 
objectives of this study are: 1) to allow subjects who are currently benefitting from 
cabozantinib t reatment as a single-agent or in combination, and who are enrolled in 
cabozantinib studies that are closing, to continue to receive cabozantinib treatment; and 2) to further characterize the long -term safety and tolerability of cabozantinib . Subjects 
who roll over to this study will continue to receive the same doses of cabozantinib and any combination therapy that they are receiving on their current study. As of the 28 February 2013 data cut-off, 34 total subjects had rolled over into the XL184-900 Study from six other XL184 studies; 8 from XL184-001, 1 from XL184-002, 14 from XL184-008, 5 from XL184-201, 3 from XL184-202, and 3 from XL184-205. No clinical activity data are available from this study  (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety Profile  
Through 28 February 2013, 1311 subjects with cancer had been treated with single- agent 
cabozantinib in open-label or unblinded company- sponsored clinical trials. The subjects 
in that data set were predominately White (87.9%) and male (64.9%) with a median age 
of 61.0 years (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).  
In Study XL184-301, [ADDRESS_829133] been treated with single- agent 
cabozantinib (n=214) or placebo (n=109). The subjects in that data set were 
predominately White (cabozantinib arm, 89.7%; placebo arm, 89.9%) and male (cabozantinib arm, 69.6%, placebo arm, 63.3%) with a median age of 55.0 years (both arms).  
Based on data available in the safety addendum of placebo -controlled Study XL184-301 
(data cut -off 31 December 2011), the median duration of exposure was 315.0 days (10.35 
months) and 104.0 days (3.42 months) in cabozantinib- treated subjects and placebo -
treated subjects, respectively. Twenty -five percent of subjects in the cabozantinib arm 
had duration of exposure of 440 days or more compared with 187 days or more in the placebo arm. This suggests that cabozantinib treatment is tolerated for prolonged perio ds 
of time.  
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
31 
 Dose modifications (reduction or delay) were frequent in the cabozantinib arm of this 
study. Most (80.8%) cabozantinib- treated subjects had a 1 -level dose reduction from 140 
mg FBE weight (175 mg malate salt weight) to 100 mg (125 mg malate salt weight) , and 
43.9% had a 2-level dose reduction from 100 mg to 60 mg (75 mg malate salt weight). In comparison, 11.0% of placebo- treated subjects had a 1 -level dose reduction, and 0.9% 
had a 2-level dose reduction. Overall, one or more dose delays due to an AE occurred in 68.7% of cabozantinib-treated subjects compared with 17.4% of placebo- treated subjects. 
The median duration of these dose delays was 4.0 days and 8.0 days in cabozantinib-treated and placebo -treated subjects, respectively (Investigator Brochure, Ve rsion 9, 
2013).  While all subjects were initially treated with a dose of 140 mg, subjects’ final recorded dose levels as of discontinuation or the data cut -off were distributed over the three 
protocol-permitted dose levels in the study (140, 100, and 60 mg qd), reflecting the use of protocol-defined dose modifications to manage AEs and adjust the dose of each subject to his or her degree of tolerance of the study drug. There was a wide range of duration of treatment at all dose levels including at the 140 mg dose (Investig ator Brochure, Version 
9, 2013).

[IP_ADDRESS].3 Deaths  
 
As of 28 February 2013, 192 fatal SAEs were reported (182 on single-agent cabozantinib 
or cabozantinib in combination with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 10 on placebo) across all open- label 
or unblinded company-sponsored studies (Studies evaluated include XL184-001, XL184-002, XL184-008, XL184-014, XL184-201, XL184-202, XL184-203, XL184-205, XL184-209, XL184-900, and all clinical pharmacology studies (n=1754). The majority of these SAEs were attributed to disease progression (70.3%) (Investigator Brochure, 
Version 9, 2013). 
Fifty -seven subjects had fatal SAEs that were attributed to reasons other than PD. 53 
subjects received cabozantinib and four received placebo. Of the 53 cabozantinib- treated 
subjects , 27 had events assessed as related to cabozantinib study treatment (24 as a single 
agent, 3 in combination with erlotinib) and 26 subjects had events attributed to reasons 
other than PD or study treatment (20 as a single agent, 6 in combination with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]).  Fatal side effects  not attributed to disease progression for Cabozantinib -treated 
subjects on open-label or unblinded studies include single cases of GI hemorrhage, hemoptysis, PE, intestinal perforation, enterocutaneous fistula, diverticular perforation, and peritonitis, 3 patients who had intracranial hemorrhage, and 4 cases who died of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]  (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
 
Population PK analysis of cabozantinib was performed using data collected from 289 
cabozantinib-treated subjects from XL184-301, XL184-001, and XL184-201 with solid 
tumors including MTC following oral administration of 140 mg daily doses. The predicted eff ective half -life is approximately 55 hours, V/F is approximately 349 L, and 
CL/F at steady -state is estimated to be 4.4 L/h. The terminal half-life (for predicting drug

 washout) is approximately [ADDRESS_829134]-dose. Repeat daily dosing of cabozantinib at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in 4- to 5-fold mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared with a single dose administration; steady state was achieved by [CONTACT_2006] 15. 
Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in human plasma (≥ 99.7%)  (Investigator Brochure, 
Version 9, 2013).  The PK evaluation of cabozantinib in the pediatric population is ongoing. A population PK analysis did not identify clinically relevant differences in clearance of cabozantinib between females and males or between Whites (89%) and non -Whites (11% [<4% were  
Asian]). Cabozantinib PK was not affected by [CONTACT_654] (20 -86 years).  
Within a 48 -day collection period after a single dose of 14C- cabozantinib in healthy 
subjects, approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered with 54% in feces and 27% in urine. A PK study of cabozantinib in patients with renal impairment (XL184 -017) is ongoing. The results of a population PK analysis suggested 
that mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance value ≥30 mL/min) does not have a clinically relevant effect on the clearance of cabozantinib. The PK evaluation of cabozantinib in subjects with hepatic impairment (XL184-003) is ongoing; preliminary data suggest that subjects with mild hepatic function impairment (Child -Pugh A) show a 
59% higher plasma AUC0- ∞ for cabozantinib as compared with matched healthy 
subjects. A high-fat meal increased Cmax and AUC values by 41% and 57%, respectively relative to fasted conditions in healthy subjects administered a single 140 mg oral cabozantinib dose (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).  Cabozantinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 in vitro. Inhibition of CYP3A4 reduced the formation of the cabozantinib N -oxide metabolite by >80%. Inhibition of CYP2C9 had a 
minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation (i.e., a <20% reduction). Inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. Cabozantinib AUC was increased 38% with coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole and decreased 77% with coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).

 Cabozantinib is a noncompetitive inhibitor of CYP2C8 (Kiapp = 4.6 μM), a mixed-type 
inhibitor of both CYP2C9 (Kiapp = 10.4 μM) and CYP2C19 (Kiapp = 28.8 μM), and a weak competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 (estimated Kiapp = 282 μM) in HLM preparations. IC50 va lues >20 μM were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 
isozymes in both recombinant and HLM assay systems. Cabozantinib at steady -state 
plasma concentrations (≥100 mg/day daily for a minimum of 21 days) showed no effect on single- dose rosiglitazone (a CY P2C8 substrate) plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC) in 
patients with solid tumors  (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).  
Cabozantinib is an inducer of CYP1A1 mRNA in human hepatocyte incubations (i.e., 75-100% of CYP1A1 positive control β -naphthoflavone induction), but not of CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 mRNA or isozyme- associated 
enzyme activities (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).  Cabozantinib is an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P -gp transport 
activities in a bi -directional assay system using MDCK -MDR1 cells (Investigator 
Brochure, Version 9, 2013). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Activity  
 In the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study XL184-301 in 330 MTC subjects, a significant 
increase in median PFS was seen in the cabozantinib arm compared with placebo (11.2 vs 4.0 months; hazard ratio [HR] =0.28; 95 CIs: 0.19, 0.40). Confirmed PRs occurred in 28% of cabozantinib- treated subjects and none in the placebo arm; responses were 
durable (median duration 14.6 months)
26. An unplanned administrative analysis of overall 
survival (OS) performed at the request of the FDA with a data cut-off of 15 June 2012 (75% of required deaths) showed a trend for improved duration of OS in the cabozantinib arm compared with placebo (26.0 months vs 20.3 months; HR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.60, 1.14). In the Phase 1 Study XL184-001, with an enriched MTC population, PRs were reported in 29% of 35 MTC subjects with measurable disease across all dose levels and in 28% of [ADDRESS_829135] clinical anti -tumor activity in early Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in several other tumor

 types. In a randomized discontinuation trial (RDT) XL184-203, the following disease 
control rates (DCR = complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD]) at Week 12 were observed in tumor types including non- small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), 38%; breast cancer, 48%; melanoma, 46%; ovarian cancer, 53%; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 66%; and CRPC, 66%. In Study XL184-008, clinical activity was also observed in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC; DCR = 73% at 24 weeks) and renal cell carci noma (RCC; median progression -free survival [PFS] = 12.9 
months). Observations of clinical activity have included decrease of soft tissue tumor lesions including visceral metastases, effects on metastatic lesions on bone scan (partial or complete bone scan  resolution), reduction in serum markers of bone resorption and 
formation, reduction in circulating tumor cells (CTCs ) in subjects with prostate cancer  
with increases in hemoglobin, and improvements in bone pain and reductions in narcotic 
use in subjects with bone metastases  (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013). 
In the Phase [ADDRESS_829136] clinical activity in men with CRPC (Smith et al. 2013). During the RDT phase, the majority of CRPC subjects with bone metastases and elevated total alkaline phosphatase (t -ALP) levels at 
basel ine showed reductions in t- ALP
26. Similarly, during the non- randomized expansion 
(NRE) phase, the majority of CRPC subjects at the 100 mg assigned dose showed reductions in circulating bone speci fic alkaline phosphatase (BSAP)
27. These effects were 
independent of prior or concomitant bisphosphonate treatment. Reductions in bone biomarkers were also evident in the 40 mg CRPC NRE cohort (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013). Effects on bone scan were assessed by [CONTACT_151985], and pain and narcotic use were prospectively assessed using an interactive voice recording system (IVRS) and a diary. Subjects achieved a bone scan response (BSR) in both the 100 mg and 40 mg assigned NRE dose cohorts (67% and 49%, respectively). Among subjects with baseline p ain of at least 4 (0 -10 scale by [CONTACT_262088] [BPI]), a majority had 
at least a decrease of 30% in the average daily worst pain compared with baseline in both cohorts (100 mg: 64% of subjects; 40 mg: 69% of subjects). In addition, more than half of subjects decreased narcotic use (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).

RET mutations 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
37 
 Of the 36 subjects tested in the XL 184 -001 study, 67% were found to harbor RET 
mutations in either blood or tumor samples. Of the remaining 12 subjects, three (8%) of 
the subjects showed no evidence of RET mutation in either tumor or blood samples, and 9 (25%) subjects had inadequate data. These results confirmed the high rate of RET mutations associated with this disease. Of the three subjects showing no evidence of RET mutation in either tumor or blood samples, two achieved PR (one confirmed) and one showed PD as best response, indicating that mutations in RET  may not be necessary for 
clinical benefit from treatment with cabozantinib.  
Serial skin biopsies from a patient with MTC enrolled in the expanded MTD (eMTD) Cohort and were analyzed using fluorescence-based IHC. Levels of phosphorylated targets of cabozantinib, MET, RET, and KIT, were significantly decreased (40%, 40%, and 61%, respectively). In addition, decreases in key downstream mediators of cabozantinib target receptors were also measured; pERK and pAKT showed decreases of 55% and 39%, respectively. These effects are similar to those obs erved inpreclinical 
experiments
28, indicating that exposure to cabozantinib results in consistent changes in 
target signaling pathways. 
In the study XL 184- 301 (EXAM trial), archival tumor samples to determine RET 
mutational status in tumors and a whole blood sample to determine hereditary RET status 
were collected. RET status was determined in 65% (215/330) of the enrolled subjects. Of these 215 subjects, 79% had activating RET mutations and 21% had no RET mutations 
detected. Of [ADDRESS_829137] a RAS gene mutation. Cabozantinib had activity across all RET 
and R AS mutational subgroups, and demonstrated response rates of 22-32%, consistent 
with the response rate of subjects in the study overall. Subjects with RET mutations had significantly longer median PFS (60 weeks) than subjects who were RET mutation -
negative (25 weeks). Subjects with RAS mutations had a median PFS of 47 weeks, 
indicating that clinical activity measured in the RET  mutation -negative subgroup can be 
attributed partially to subjects with RAS  muta tions (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 
2013). 
BRAF  
Preliminary analysis of 48 melanoma subjects with both tumor response and BRAF 
mutation data suggests that the clinical activity of cabozantinib is independent of BRAF mutation status (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).. Clinical activity of

 cabozantinib also appears to be independent of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) 
and KRAS mutation status in NSCLC subjects based on the preliminary data (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013). 
Biomarkers of response of anti -angiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_622652] (XL -184- 201) were analyzed for several 
biomarkers of response to anti-angiogenic agents, including levels of VEGF- A, 
sVEGFR2, and PlGF. Changes in pharmacodynamic markers consistent with 
cabozantinib on- target effects w ere observed after cabozantinib administration in 40 
subjects treated with a starting dose of 140 mg FBE weight (175 mg malate salt weight). Changes in PlGF (↑), VEGF -A (↑), sVEGFR2 (↓), and soluble KIT (sKIT)(↓) reached 
statistical significance at multiple time points, particularly Days 15 and 29. Soluble MET as a potential biomarker of MET inhibition was modulated (↑) upon cabozantinib treatment and changes reached statistical significance as well, on Day 15 and Day 57 (Cycle 3 Day 1) (Investig ator Brochure, Version 9, 2013). 
In the study XL 184- 301 (EXAM trial), exposure to cabozantinib resulted in significant 
decreases in the levels of the circulating sVEGFR2 and sKIT, consistent with results observed in other cabozantinib studies and with other anti-VEGFR2 inhibitors, and a modest but statistically significant relationship between plasma cabozantinib exposure and pharmacodynamic response was apparent (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013). 
Markers of bone turnover Circulating CTx was reduced in the majority of CRPC patients in cluded in the XL- 184-
[ADDRESS_829138] activity, the majority of CRPC RDTsubjects with bone metastases and elevated t -ALP levels at baseline showed reductions in t- ALP  
(Investigator Brochure, Ve rsion 9, 2013) . Similarly, the majority of CRPC NRE subjects 
at the 100 mg assigned dose showed reductions in circulating BSAP
26. These effects were 
independent of prior or concomitant bisphosphonate treatment. Reductions in bone biomarkers were also evident in the 40 mg CRPC NRE cohort: the median change in CTx at Week 12 was a 31% reduction and 50% of evaluable patients exhibited a decrease in BSAP at week 12 or later (Investigator Brochure, Version 9, 2013).

39% of evaluable subjects converted to < 5 CTCs at Week 6

CRPC NRE cohort, reductions in CTCs were observed regardless of prior therapy in 39 subjects with baseline CTC counts ≥ 5/7.5 mL of blood and a Week 6 and/or Week 12 assessment: 67% demonstrated CTC decrease ≥30% in their CTC count, while 22% of evaluable subjects converted to <5 CTCs at Week 6  (Investigator Brochure, Version 9,

1.3 Study Population,  
1.3.1  Study Population for the Study:  
Patients with malignant PHs and PGs have metastases into visceral organs and/or the 
skeleton. Depending on metastases location, the patients can be classified as follows:  
40% of the patients have only visceral involvement (liver, lungs, lymph nodules)  40% have visceral and bone metastases  
 20% have bone metastases only.  
 
Based on this information, we will divide our study population in two different branches:  
• Main branch: 14 patients with measurable disease (+/ - bone metastases)  
• Exploratory branch: 8 patients with bone metastases  only (+/- small non -
measurable lesions) .

[ADDRESS_829141] 1.1 CR, PR, and SD. With 14 patients, the 95% confidence interval for a 45% response rate would be (18.9, 71.1%). For the exploratory objective in the small group of patients with bone metastases, the 95% confidence interval for a 45% response rate with 8 patients would be (10.5, 79.5%). We do not include a formal statistical monitoring rule for toxicity given the establishe d 
safety profile of this drug.   Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median and range. Categorical variables will be tabulated by [CONTACT_622671].  Response rates and their 95% confidence intervals will be estimated. Kaplan Meier survival curves will be used to estimate 
survival outcomes.  Cox proportional hazards regression analysis may be used to assess the association between survival and covariates of interest. The Fisher’s exact test or logistic regression analysis will be used for any binary outcomes. T -tests or Wilcoxon 
rank sum tests will be used to compare continuous variables. Longitudinal models may be explored to study change over time. 
Each subject’s course will consist of three periods: 
• A Pre -Treatment Period in which subjects are consented and undergo screening 
assessments to be qualified for the study (Section  5.1);  
• A Treatment Period in which subjects receive study treatment and undergo study 
assessments (Section  5.2);

In all subjects, dose reductions and delays to manage toxicity are allowed under the 
guidelines in S ection  3.3 below. 
3.3 Cabozantinib Dose Modifications, Interruptions, and Discontinuation  
Subjects will be monitored for AEs from the time of signing informed consent through 30 days after the date of the decision to permanently discontinue cabozantinib treatment. Subjects will be instructed to notify their physician immediately at the onset of any  AE. 
Causality assessment of AEs should include at minimum confounding factors such as

 disease and  concomitant medications. AE s everity will be grad ed by [CONTACT_622684] v.4.0.  
The following should be taken into consideration in decisions regarding dose 
modifications (reductions or interruption):  
• As a general approach all AEs should be managed with supportive care at the earliest signs of toxicity considered  related to the study treatment. S hould this be ineffective, 
dose interruptions and/or reductions should be considered to prevent worsening of 
toxicity.  
• Dose modification criteria for cabozantinib are detailed in Section 3.3. Dose 
interruptions and/or reductions should be implemented for unacceptable toxicity. Doses may be modified at any time while on study. 
• The assigned dose for cabozantinib is 60 mg/day. 20 mg dose reduction levels of cabozantinib are permitted (see Table 3-2).  
• Dose reductions or interruptions may also occur in the setting of lower grade toxicity than defined in Sections 3.3.1 and [IP_ADDRESS], if the investigator feels it is in the interest 
of a subject’s safety  and will optimize drug tolerability . 
• Interruption of cabozantinib  treatment for AEs  may occur at any time per investigator 
discretion.  If treatment is interrupted due to AEs for more than [ADDRESS_829146] may be able to restart therapy with a dose reduction upon resolution of the toxicity. 
• Dose interruptions for reason(s) other than AEs (eg, surgical procedures) can be longer than 6 weeks per the discretion of the investigator.  
Guidelines for the management of specific AEs are provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].

3.3.1 Management of Adverse Events  
Guidelines for the management of AE s (ie,  dose interruptions and dose reductions) are 
presented in the next sections  (Section s 3.3.1 and [IP_ADDRESS]). Each dose reduction of 
cabozantinib should be to one dose level lower that the current dose . Dose reductions of 
more than one dose level are acceptable if agreed to by [CONTACT_119576]. All AEs should 
also be managed with supportive care at the earliest signs of toxicity considered related to 
the study treatment.   
If study treatme nt of cabozantinib  is restarted after being withheld or interrupted, the 
subject should be instructed not to m ake up the missed doses of cabozantinib.  
The r eason for treatment delay and reduced dose must be recorded on the case report form 
(CRF ). 
Dosing may need to be interrupted for AEs considered not related to cabozantinib  if this 
is clinically indicated or if causality is initially uncertain. Study treatment may be resumed at the same dose (or a lower dose per investigator judgment) if the AE is determined not to be related to cabozantinib  once the investigator determines that 
retreatment is clinically appropriate and the subject meets the protocol re -treatment 
criteria.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Cabozantinib Dose Reinstitution and Reescalation  
If the subject recovers from his or her AE and the AE was unrelated to study treatment, then study treatment may be restarted with no change in dose.  
Subjects receiving a daily dose of 20 mg may be restarted at the same dose if deemed 
safe at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects unable to tolerate a daily dose of 20 mg should discontinue study treatment. 
Re-escalation to the previous dose, (but not higher than 60 mg/day) may be allowed at the 
discretion of the investigator but no sooner than 2 weeks beyond resolution of AEs that 
led to the dose reduction. Dose re-escalation is not allowed for a drug- relate d dose 
reduction triggered by [CONTACT_152002] 4 AEs affecting major organs (eg, central nervous system, cardiac, hepatic, renal).

[IP_ADDRESS] Cabozantinib Warnings, Precautions , and Guidelines for Management of 
Specific Adverse Events 
The side effect  profile of cabozantinib includes GI symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhea , mucositis/stomatitis ), fatigue/asthenia, anorexia, weight loss, skin disorders 
including palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia ( PPE) syndrome, elevated liver function tests 
(including alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] and aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ]), 
osteonecrosis,  increased pancreatic enzymes with rare cases of overt pancreatitis, thyroid 
function disorders , as well as side effects associated with inhibition of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF ) signaling. The latter of these include  arterial and 
venous thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ), pulmonary embolism 
(PE), transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction , hypertension, hemorrhagic 
events, proteinuria, wound complications, and rare cases of GI perforation, fistulae 
formation and rectal/perirectal abscess , and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy 
(RPLS) . Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional details.  
As with all investigational products, unknown AEs may occur. Subjects should be monitored closely for all AEs. As with other agents in development, additional AEs are unknown. As of 22 October 2013, in studies with cabozantinib angioedema has been reported to occur in ~0.1% of subjects treated.  
The predicted effective plasma half -life of cabozantinib is [ADDRESS_829152] subjects 2  to 3 weeks to reach steady state. If 
AEs attributable to cabozantinib  occur within the initial 3 -week period of dosing, early 
intervention with dose modifications may be justified for AEs that, if worsened, could 
potentially be dangerous or debilitating, because without a dose adjustment, systemic exposure of cabozantinib might be expected to increase after the onset of the AE.

 (PPE and rash ), wound healing, hypertension, thromboembolic events, proteinuria, QTc 
prolongation, hypophosphatemia, thyroid function disorders  are presented  in this section 
because these have been observed in previous studies with cabozantinib or represent 
common class effect toxicity. In addition, guidelines to minimize the risk for potential serious adverse events ( SAEs ) such as hemorrhagic events, GI and non- GI perforation 
and fistula formation,  wound healing hemorrhagic events, and ONJ are provided in this 
section.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  for additional practice guidelines and 
management recommendations for side effects potentially related to cabozantinib 
treatment (such as asymptomatic elevations of amylase and lipase, pancreatitis,  rectal and perirectal abscess, cardiac disorders, endocrine disorders, eye disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], thoracic and mediastinal disorders) ; available information on potential risk of congenital, 
familial and genetic disorders ; and guidelines on management of overdose of 
cabozantinib study treatment.  
Below are guidelines for the treatment and/or prevention of certain treatment- emergent 
AEs of interest that have been associated with, or have a theoretical possibility of 
occurring with, cabozantinib treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_829153] signs of 
poorly formed or loose stool or an increased frequency of bowel movements. Administration of antidiarrheal/antimotility agents is recommended at the first sign of diarrhea as initial management. Some subjects may require concomitant treatment with more than one antidiarrheal agent. When therapy with antidiarrheal agents does not control the diarrhea to tolerab le levels, study treatment should be temporarily interrupted  
or dose reduced per Table 3-[ADDRESS_829154] sign of nausea 
and vomiting or as prophylaxis to prevent emesis, along with supportive care in accordance to clinical practice guidelines
30,31. The 5- HT3 receptor antagonists are 
recommended over chronic use of NK -1 receptor antagonists and dexamethasone (NK-1 
receptor antagonists can induce or inhibit CYP3A4, and glucocorticoids induce CYP3A4 
and thus could lower cabozantinib exposure ( see Sections 3.4.4). Caution is also 
recommended with the use of nabilone, which is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. When therapy with antiemetic  agents does not control the nausea or vomiting to  tolerable levels, 
study treatment should be temporarily interrupted or dose reduced per Table 3-[ADDRESS_829155] local treatments such 
as nontraumatic cleansing and oral rinses (eg, with a weak solution of salt and baking soda) should be maintained. The oral cavity should be rinsed after meals, and dentures should be cleaned and brushed often to remove plaque. Local treatment should be instituted at the earliest onset of symptoms. Obtain bacterial/viral culture if oral infection is suspected and treat infection as indicated by [CONTACT_13144]. When sto matitis 
interferes with adequate nutrition and local therapy is not adequately effective, dose reduction or temporary withholding of cabozantinib should be considered per Table 3-2 and Table 3-3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatobiliary Disorders 
Elevations of transaminases have also been observed during treatment with cabozantinib. 
In general, it is recommended that subjects with elevation of ALT, AST, and/or bilirubin 
have more frequent laboratory monitoring of these parameters. Other causes that may contribute to transaminase elevations should be considered.  If possible, hepatotoxic 
concomitant medications and alcohol should be discontinued in subjects who develop elevated transaminases.

[ADDRESS_829168] or ALT increases are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_408251] , and/or elevations of coagulation 
tests (eg,  Inter national Normalized Ratio [INR]). M onitoring of transaminases should be 
intensified (2 –3 times per week) and cabozantinib should be held until the etiology of the 
abnormalities is determined and these abnormalities are correct ed or stabilize at clinically 
acceptable levels (INR < 1.5 ×  upper limit of normal [ULN] , total bilirubin <  1.5 ×  ULN, 
aminotransferases ≤ baseline grade ).  
Subjects must have cabozantinib permanently discontinued if transaminase elevations are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_528930] (bilirubin elevation > 2  × ULN), in 
the absence of evidence of biliary obstruction (ie , significant elevation of alkaline 
phosphatase) or some other explanation of the injury (eg , viral hepatitis, alcohol hepatitis), 
because the combined finding (ie, Hy’s Law cases) represents a signal of a potential for the 
drug to cause severe liver injury.  
All subjects who develop isolated bilirubin  elevations of Grade [ADDRESS_829169] study 
treatment held until r ecovered  to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline (or lower) . If this occurs within 
[ADDRESS_829170] be  permanently  
discontinued. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Fatigue, Anorexia, and Weight Loss 
Fatigue has been reported during treatment with cabozantinib. Common causes of fatigue 
such
 as anemia, deconditioning, emotional distress (depression and/or anxiety), nutrition, 
sleep disturbance, and hypothyroidism should be ruled out and/or these causes treated in 
accordance to standard of care. Individual non-pharmacological and/or pharmacologic interventions directed to the contributing and treatable factors should be given. Pharmacological management with psychostimulants such as methylphenidate should be considered after disease specific morbidities have been excluded.  Note : Chronic use of 
modafinil should be avoided because of its potential to reduce cabozantinib exposure (see 
Investigator’s Brochure ).  Refer to Table 3-[ADDRESS_829171] of care 
including nutritional support. Pharmacologic therapy such as megestrol acetate should be considered for appetite enhancement.   If fatigue, anorexia, or weight loss cannot be 
adequately managed, study treatment should be temporarily interrupted  or dose reduced 
per Table 3-2 and Table 3-3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Skin Disorders  
Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (also known as hand- foot syndrome), skin 
rash (including blisters, erythematous rash, macular rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis acneiform, and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, and erythema have been reported in cabozantinib-treated subjects. All subjects on study should be advised on prophylactic skin care. This includes the use of hypoallergenic moisturizing creams, ointment for dry skin, and sunscreen with sun protection factor ≥  30, avoidance of exposure of hands and 
feet to hot water, protection of pressure -sensitive areas of hands and feet , and use of thick 
cotton gloves and socks to prevent injury and to keep the palms and soles dry. Subjects with skin disorders should be carefully monitored for signs of infection (eg, abscess, cellulitis, or impetigo).  
Early signs of hand-foot syndrome could be tingling, numbness, and slight redness or mild hyperkeratosis. Early manifestations include painful, symmetrical red and swollen areas on the palms and soles. The lateral sides of the fingers or peri -ungual zones may 
also be affected. Adequate interventions are required to prevent worsening of skin symptoms such as blisters, desquamations, ulcerations, or necrosis of affected areas. Aggressive management of symptoms is recommended, including early dermatology referral. Treatment guidelines for PPE related to study treatment are presented in  
Table  3-6. 
In the case of study treatment -related skin changes (eg, rash, hand- foot syndrome), the 
investigator may request that additional assessments be conducted with the subject’s consent. These assessments may include digital photographs of the skin changes and/or a biopsy of the affected skin and may be repeated until the skin changes resolve.

[IP_ADDRESS] Wound Healing and Surgery  
VEGF R inhibitors  can cause wound healing complications and wound dehiscence which 
may occur even long after a wound has been considered healed. Therefore, s urgical and 
traumatic wounds must have completely healed before  starting cabozantinib treatment 
and be monitored for wound dehiscence or wound infection while the subject is being 
treated with cabozantinib.  If possible, cabozantinib treatment should be stopped for at 
least 28 days prior to major surgery.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypertension  
Hypertension is a common class effect of drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways and has been reported among subjects treated with cabozantinib. 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
57 
 Blood pressure should be monitored in a constant position at each visit ( either sitting or 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). Treatment guidelines for hypertension deemed related to cabozantinib  are 
presented in Table 3-7. In ge neral, subjects with known hypertension should be optimally 
managed before study entry. Decisions to decrease or hold the dose of study treatment 
must be based on blood pressure  readings taken by a medical professional and must be 
confirmed with a second measurement at least [ADDRESS_829174] measurement. 
Other than for hypertension requiring immediate therapy, the presence of new or worsened hypertension should be confirmed at a second visit before taking therapeutic action. It is recommended that this second visit occurs within 1  week.

 cabozantinib; including fatal events (please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure). Subjects 
who develop a PE or DVT should have cabozantinib treatment held until therapeutic anticoagulation with heparins (eg, low molecular weight heparin [ LMWH ]) is 
established. (Note: Therapeutic anticoagulation with oral anticoagulants, eg, warfarin,  or 
oral platelet inhibitors such as clopi[INVESTIGATOR_622654]). Cabozantinib 
treatment may be resumed in subjects who are stable and have uncomplicated PE or D VT 
and are deriving clinical benefit from cabozantinib treatment.  During anticoagulation 
treatment, subjects need to be monitored on an ongoing basis for bleeding risk and signs of bleeding which may require additional or more frequent laboratory tests in accordance 
to institutional guidelines.  If there are any signs of clinically significant bleedings, 
cabozantinib treatment should be permanently discontinued. 
Arterial thrombotic events (eg, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction) have 
bee
n observed in studies with cabozantinib. Subjects should be evaluated for preexisting 
risk factors for arterial thrombotic events such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipi [INVESTIGATOR_035], 
hypertension, coronary artery disease, history of tobacco use, and cardiac or thromboembolic events that occurred before initiation of study treatment. Cabozantinib 
treatment should be discontinued in subjects who develop an acute myocardial infarction or any other clinically relevant arterial thromboembolic complication.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Proteinuria  
Proteinuria is an anticipated AE with the inhibition of VEGF pathways and has been observed in cabozantinib clinical studies, and nephrotic syndrome has been reported with cabozantinib and other inhibitors of VEGF pathways.  Management guidelines are

QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double- blinded, placebo -controlled phase [ADDRESS_829177] form 
morphology or new rhythms were not observed. Accordingly, subjects in this study will 
be monitored for potential QT effects.  
Other factors which may contribute to QTc prolongation include: 
• Treatment with other drugs associated with QTc prolongation (see 
http://www.qtdrugs.org); 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
61 
 • Treatment with CyP 3A4 inhibitors (which may inc rease cabozantinib drug 
levels);  
• Electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia); 
• Medical conditions which can alter electrolyte status eg, severe or prolonged 
diarrhea.  
Subjects having any of these additional risk factors while on cabozantinib must have electrocardiograms (ECGs ) performed approximately one week after the onset of these 
factors.  
If at any time on study there is an increase in QTc to an absolute value > 500 msec, two additional ECGs should be performed within 30 minutes after the initial ECG with intervals not less than 3 minutes apart.  If the average QTc calculated by [CONTACT_152012] (QTcF ) from the three ECGs is > [ADDRESS_829178] be withheld 
and the following actions should be taken: 
• Check electrolytes, especially potassium, magnesium and calcium. C orrect 
abnormalities as clinically indicated ; 
• If possible, discontinue any QTc -prolonging concomitant medications;  
• Repeat ECG triplets hourly until the average QTcF is ≤ [ADDRESS_829179]. 
The MD  Anderson Cancer Center/IND Office  should be notified immediately of any 
QTc prolongation event: 
• Subjects with QTc prolongation and symptoms must be monitored closely until the QTc  elevation has resolved. Cardiology consultation is recommended for 
evaluation and subject management. Symptomatic subjects must be treated in accordance with  standard clinical  practice. No additional study treatment is to be 
given to the subject until after the event has resolved, the subject has been thoroughly evaluated, and further treatment has been agreed to by [CONTACT_622693]/IND Office. If any additional study treatment is given (eg, after correction  of electrolyte abnormalities and normalization of QTcF), it 
will be at a reduced dose as agreed to by [CONTACT_622694]/IND Office.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Hypophosphatemia  
Hypophosphatemia has been reported during treatment with cabozantinib. Serum 
phosphorus should be monitored frequently while receiving cabozantinib. Mild hypophosphatemia is usually asymptomatic or symptoms can be  non- specific such as 
weakness, bone pain, rhabdomyolysis, or altered mental status. Other causes of hypophosphatemia such as poor nutrition, chronic alcoholism , malabsorption, excessive 
antacid use, glucocorticoids use, kidney dysfunction, respi[INVESTIGATOR_245034], vitamin D deficiency should be rule d out and/or these causes treated in accordance to standard of 
care.  Mild to moderate hypophospha temia should be managed by [CONTACT_622695] (diary items, meats, beans) and/or oral phosphate supplements in accordance to standard clinical practice guidelines.   
Clinically relevant hypophosphatemia should be managed in accordance to the dose 
modification guidelines as outlined in Table 3-2 and Table 3-3  or as clinically indicated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Thyroid Function Disorders  
Changes in thyroid function tests (TFTs) and hypothyroidism have been reported with cabozantinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment as a result of altered thyroid hormone regulation by [CONTACT_622696] (Torino e t al. 
2009). Preliminary data from ongoing studies indicate that treatment-emergent elevation of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) by [CONTACT_622697]-dependent in fashion. Hyperthyroidism has also been reported. Currently available data are insuff icient 
to determine the mechanism of TFT alterations and its clinical relevance. Routine monitoring of thyroid function and assessments for signs and symptoms associated with thyroid dysfunction is recommended before initiation and during treatment with cabozantinib. Management of thyroid dysfunction (eg, symptomatic hypothyroidism) should follow accepted clinical practice guidelines and dose modification guidelines as outlined in  Table 3-2
32.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hemorrhagic Events 
Hemorrhagic events have been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib. In order to mitigate risk of severe hemorrhage, subjects should be evaluated for potential bleeding risk factors before initiating cabozantinib 
treatment and monitored for bleeding events with serial complete blood counts and physical examination while on study. Risk factors for hemorrhagic events may include (but may not be limited to) the following: 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
63 
 • Tumor of the lung with cavitary lesions or tumor lesions which invades, encases, 
or abuts major blood vessels. The anatomic location and characteristics of tumor as well as the medical history must be carefully reviewed in the selection of subjects for treatment with cabozantinib;  
• Recent or concurrent radiation to the thoracic cavity ; 
• Active peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis, and other inflammatory GI diseases ; 
• Underlying medical conditions which affect normal hemostasis (eg, deficiencies in clotting factors and/or platelet function, or thrombocytopenia) ; 
• Concomitant medication with anticoagulants or other drugs which affect normal hemostasis ; 
• History of clinically significant hemoptysis . 
Discontinue cabozantinib treatment in subjects who have been diagnosed with a severe bleeding complication.  
[IP_ADDRESS] GI Perforation/Fistula and Non -GI Fistula Formation  
GI perforation/fistula and non-GI fistula formation have been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib. Carefully monitor for epi[INVESTIGATOR_151949], especially among subjects with known risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_151950]/fistula , and carefully monitor subjects with known risk factors 
for non-GI fistula, to allow for early diagnosis. Such risk factors include (but may not be limited to) the following: 
GI perforation/fistula:  
• Intra -abdominal tumor/metastases invading GI mucosa ; 
• Active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, 
cholecystitis or symptomatic cholangitis, or appendicitis ; 
• History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess; 
• Prior GI surgery (particularly when associated with delayed or incomplete healing). Complete healing after abdominal surgery or resolution of

[ADDRESS_829180] be confirmed before initiating treatment with 
cabozantinib. 
Additional risk factors include concurrent chronic use of steroid treatment or nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs. Constipation indicative  of bowel obstruction should be 
monitored and effectively managed.  
Non-GI fistula:  
Complications from radiation therapy has been identified as a possible predisposing risk 
factor for non -GI fistula formation among subjects undergoing treatment with VEGF 
pathway inhibitors (eg, bevacizumab).  
Discontinue cabozantinib treatment in subjects who have been diagnosed with GI or 
non-GI perforation/fistula.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Osteonecrosis of the Jaw  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported with use of anti -angiogenic drugs and 
bisphosphonates and denosumab in cancer patients. Additional risk factors for ONJ have been identified such as use of corticosteroids, chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, smoking, dental or orofacial surgery procedures, and cancer disease itself. Osteonecrosis has been reported among  subjects treated with cabozantinib, the details of 
which are provided in the current version of Investigator’s Brochure. As a preventive measure, invasive dental procedures should be avoided if possible in subjects who have previously been treated with or concomitantly receive bisphosphonates or denosumab. 
In cases where dental procedures are unavoidable, the risks and benefits of a dental 
procedure and the extent of the procedure as well as the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_622655] a temporary treatment interruption of cabozantinib.

 • Erythropoietic stimulating agents (eg, epoetin alfa  and darbepoetin alfa) should 
not be used based on a report of increased risk of tumor recurrence and/ or 
progression associated with erythropoietin (Wright 2007); 
• Chronic co-administration of cabozantinib with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 
family (eg,  dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, 
rifapentin e, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) may significantly decrease 
cabozantinib concentrations and should be avoided. Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is  recommended; 
• Caution must be used when discontinuing treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer in a subject who has been concurrently receiving a stable dose of cabozantinib, because this could significantly increase the exposure to 
cabozantinib; 
• Co-administration of cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family 
(eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir) may increase cabozantinib concentrations and should be avoided. Grapefruit and Seville oranges may also increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib and should be avoided. 
Additional information on potential drug interactions with cabozantinib is provided in Section 3.4.5. 
3.4.5 Potential Drug Interactions  
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) : Data
  from a clinical drug interaction study (Study  XL184-008) 
show that clinically relevant steady -state concentrations of cabozantinib appear to have 
no marked effect on the area under the plasma drug concentration time curve ( AUC) of 
co-administered rosiglitazone, a CYP2C8 substrate. Therefore, cabozantinib is not 
anticipated to markedly inhibit CYP2C8 in the clinic, and by [CONTACT_151998], is not anticipated 
to markedly inhibit other CYP450 isozymes that have lower [I]/Ki values compared with  
CYP2C8 (ie,  CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4). In vitro data 
indicate that cabozantinib is unlikely to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible induction of CYP1A1 at high cabozantinib concentrations (30 μM).   
Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate and a weak substrate for  CYP
 2C9 (but not a 
CYP2D6 , CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, or CYP1A2 substrate), based on data from in 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
68 
 vitro studies. Results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-006, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in an approximately 77 % reduction in cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after 
a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Chronic co- administration of 
cabozantinib with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 family (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin e, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) may 
significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations. The chronic use of strong CYP3A4 
inducers should be avoided. Other drugs that induce CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to decrease exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib. Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is recommended.  
Results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-007, showed that concurrent 
administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 38% increase in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Co- administration of cabozantinib with strong 
inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir) may increase cabozantinib concentrations. Grapefruit and Seville oranges may also increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib and should be avoided. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to increase exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib. Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition potential is recom mended.  
In addition, c imetidine should be avoided because of its potential to interfere with 
CYP3A4 medi ated metabolism of cabozantinib . 
Please refer to the drug interaction tables at the following websites for lists of substrates, 
inducers, and inhibitors of selected CYP450 isozyme pathways:

Protein Binding:  Cabozantinib is highly bound (≥  99.7%) to human plasma proteins. 
Therefore, highly protein bound drugs should be used with caution with cabozantinib 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
69 
 because there is a potential displacement interaction that could increase free 
concentratio ns of cabozantinib and/or a co-a dministered highly protein -bound drug (and a 
corresponding increase in pharmacologic effect). 
Other Interactions : Food may increase exposure levels of cabozantinib  by 57% , fasting 
recommendations should be followed. In vitro data suggest that cabozantinib is unlikely 
to be a substrate for P-glycoprotein, but it does appear to have the potential to inhibit the P-glycoprotein  transport activity. Therefore,  cabozantinib may have the potential to 
increase plasma concentrations of co -administered  substrates of P-glycop rotein . 
Additional details related to these overall conclusions can be found in the investigator brochure. 
Additional details regarding potential drug interactions with cabozantinib can be found in

to satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all unused cabozantinib will be reconciled and destroyed in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations.

5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
5.1 Pre-Treatment Period  
During the Pre- Treatment Period, subjects are consented and qualified (screened) for the 
study. Informed consent must be obtained before initiation of any clinical screening 
procedure that is performed solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for this study. Evaluations performed as part of routine care before informed consent can be considered  as screening evaluations if done within the defined screening period, and if 
permitted by [CONTACT_779]’s institutional review board ( IRB)/ ethics committee ( EC) policies.  
Study eligibility is based on meeting all of the study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at screening and on Study Day [ADDRESS_829208] dose of 
cabozantinib on this protocol: 
1. For patients with measurable visceral metastases CT scans with contrast or MRI are 
required. Bone scan is required for patients with visceral metastases who also have bone metastases.  
2. For patients with only bone metastases FDG-PET/CT scan is the only radiographic 
test required. FDG -PET/CT assessment will include standard assessment of SUV
max, 
as well as advanced volumetric measures including SUV peak, metabolic tumor volume 
(MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) 
3. Laboratory testing (chemistry, hematology tests, interleukin -6, c- reactive protein , 
thyroid function tests, urine analysis, and t hyroid function tests )  
4. EKGs will be performed at baseline.  
5. Plasma metanephrines and  chromogranin A will be obtained at baseline.  
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
75 
 6. Evaluation of cancer symptoms by [CONTACT_326367] (MDASI) 
will be obtained at baseline  
7. Physical examination, safety and adverse events evaluation will be performed at baseline.  
 
For each subject, the Pre -Treatment Period ends upon receipt of the first dose of study 
treatment or final determination that the subject is ineligible for the study.  
5.2 Treatment Period   
During the T reatment P eriod , subjects will receiv e cabozantinib until either disease 
progression (unless the investigator, with approval of the Medical Monitor, judges the 
patient is deriving clinical benefit), the occurrence of unacceptable drug -related toxicity  
or for other reason(s) for subject withdrawal as described in Section 2.5. Subjects should 
be instructed to immediately inform the principal investigator (PI ) of any AEs. Subjects 
experiencing dizziness, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], or other symptoms that could influence alertness or coordination should be advised not to drive or operate other heavy machinery. 
The following schedule of assessments applies to all subjects ( Table  5-1). More frequent 
assessments should be obtained if clinically indicated.

The method of collecting the patient questionnaire assessments will be based on patient preference and may be varied throughout the study based on patient request. 
Data collection by [CONTACT_75595]. IVR systems are programmed to call patients at home for 
symptom assessment. The IVR system asks patients to rate each symptom and interference item on the MDASI- Pheo/PGL 0–10 numeric scales using the keypad of a 
touchtone telephone. Participants electing to use the IVR system may be provided with an informational brochure outlining the steps to complete an IVR call (Appendix G). A telephone number will be provided in the e vent of questions or problems. Patients will 
also be given a P atient Identification Number (PIN) for access to the system. IVR calls 
will be scheduled at a time that is convenient for the patient. Completion or failure of calls will be monitored by [CONTACT_16133]. In the event of missed calls, a notification screen will appear in the IVR system to alert the research staff. The research staff will then contact [CONTACT_66079], check on their status and, if possible, complete the assessment with the patient during the telephone interview. With the patient’s  approval, 
the system then will continue calling the patient at the preset schedule. The IVR symptom and interference data will be available on an MD Anderson intranet site with access

Adverse events will be documented in the patient’s official medical record and in the patient’s essential source document. All grades will be recorded in the electronic database (CORe), and the attribution of Not- Related and Related will be assessed.  
Assessment of the relationship of the AR to the study treatment by [CONTACT_622703]: 
• Not Related: A not- related AE is defined as an AE that is not associated with the 
study treatment and is attributable to another cause or there is no evidence to support a causal relationship ; 
• Related: A related AE is defined as an AE where a causal relationship between the event and the study treatment is a reasonable possibility. A reasonable causal 
relationship is meant to convey that there are facts (eg, evidence such as dechallenge/rechallenge) or other clinical arguments to suggest a causal relationship between the AE and study treatment.  
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
82 
 The SAE definition and reporting requirements are in accordance with the International 
Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2A.  
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) for M. D. Anderson -sponsored IND Protocols : 
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the patient, in the 
view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_372203] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
 
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_195696], IND Office.  
 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University 
of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Bo ard Policy for Investigators on 
Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise in the 
protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of 
attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).  
 
• All life -threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the study drug, must have 
a written report submitted within 24  hours  (next working day) of knowledge of the event to the 
Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
 
• Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety reporting 
to the IND Office and MDACC IRB .  
 
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific intervention,  
until [ADDRESS_829222] returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or the re has been acceptable resolution of the event.

83 
 • Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_829223] be reported to the IND Office. This  may include the development of a 
secondary malignancy.  
 Reporting to FDA:  
 
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_79438] (Safety Project Manager IND 
Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_177191], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.  
6.1.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  to Supporting Company Exelixis 
As soon as an investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the definition of ‘serious,’ 
this should be documented to the extent that information is available.  
• Investigator shall notify Exelixis within twenty -four (24) hours of making such 
discovery by [CONTACT_622704]; 
• This report must be submitted by [CONTACT_622705] e -mail: 
[EMAIL_131]  or fax 650-837- 7392, even if it i s not felt to be drug 
related;  
• Pregnancy (for a subject or for the partner of a subject), although not itself an S
AE, should also be reported on an SAE form or pregnancy form and be followed 
up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or congenital abnormalities ; 
• SAEs that must be recorded on an SAE Reporting form include the following: 
o all SAEs that occur after informed consent and through 30 days after the decision to discontinue study treatment (or the date the subject is deemed to be a screen failure);  
o any SAEs assessed as related to study treatment or study procedures, even if the SAE occurs more than 30  days after the decision to discontinue 
study treatment; 
o although most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143190], some 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622658], as follows: elective or 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
[ADDRESS_829224] not worsened after initiation of treatment (eg , a previously 
scheduled ventral hernia repair); pre -specified study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622659]; or events that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622660] 24 hours 
and that do not require admission ( eg, an emergency room visit for 
hematuria that results in a diagnosis of cystitis and discharge to home on oral antibiotics).  SAEs must, however, be reported for any surgical or 
procedural complication resulting in prolongation of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
6.1.4 Regulatory Reporting 
All serious unexpected adverse drug reactions (unexpected related SAEs) must be 
reported to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) as required by 21 CFR 312.32: 
• These reports are to be filed utilizing the MD  Anderson Cancer Center Internal 
SAE Report Form for Prompt Reporting; 
• The MD Anderson Cancer Center  Internal SAE Report Form for Prompt 
Reporting must be submitted by [CONTACT_622706]-report to Exelixis’ IND. E- mail: [EMAIL_131] ; Fax [PHONE_154].

reduction or delay or requirement for additional medication or monitoring) or that is 
considered to be of clinical significance by [CONTACT_622707]. 
6.2.[ADDRESS_829226] inform the MD 
Anderson Cancer Center/IND Office of the pregnancy. Forms for reporting pregnancies will be provided to the study sites upon request. The outcome of a pregnancy (for a subject or for the partner of a subject) and the medical condition of any resultant offspring must be reported to Exelixis or designee. Any birth defect or congenital anomaly must be reported as an SAE , and any other untoward events occurring during 
the pregnancy must be reported as AEs or SAEs, as appropriate.  
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
85 
 6.2.3 Medication Errors/Overdose 
Any study drug administration error or overdose that results in an AE, even if it does not 
meet the definition of serious, requires reporting within [ADDRESS_829227] be followed until 
either resolution of the event or determination by [CONTACT_622708]. This follow -up guidance also applies to related SAEs that 
occur > 30 days after the decision to discontinue study treatment. The status of all other continuing AEs will be documented as of 30 days after the decision to discontinue study treatment.  
7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This Phase II study's primary
 objective is to estimate the best overall response rate in 
patients with measurable disease.  Response will include RECIST 1.1 CR, PR, and SD. 
With 14 patients, the 95% confidence interval for a 45% response rate would be (18.9, 
71.1%). For the exploratory objective in the small group of patients with bone metastases, the 95% confidence interval for a 45% response rate with 8 patients would be (10.5, 
79.5%). We do not include a formal statistical monitoring rule for toxicity given the 
established safety profile of this drug.  
 
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean, 
standard deviation, median and range. Categorical variables will be tabulated by [CONTACT_622671].  Response rates and their 95% confidence intervals will be estimated. Kaplan Meier survival curves will be used to estimate 
survival outcomes.  Cox proportional hazards regression analysis may be used to assess the association between survival and covariates of interest. The Fisher’s exact test or logistic regression analysis will be used for any binary outcomes. T -tests or Wilcoxon 
rank sum tests will be used to compare continuous variables. Longitudinal models may be 
explored to study change over time.

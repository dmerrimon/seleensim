Title:  Rinovum Subsidiary 2, LLC. Disposable Stress Urinary Incontinence Device Efficacy and 
Safety Study  
Précis:   This study is an interventional, single arm, multi -center study. It will be 
conducted at sites in the northeastern [LOCATION_002]. The protocol will be 
approved by [CONTACT_396620] . The sample size will 
consist of  approximately  50 participants. Participants will undergo an initi al 
control period in which preweighed pads will be worn for 7 consecutive days 
for 12 hours. This will be followed by [CONTACT_396621] 14 consecutive days  
where participants will wear both device and preweighed pads 
simultaneously . for 12 hours .  
 
Objectives:  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an over -
the-counter (OTC) disposable stress urinary incontinence (SUI) pessary 
device. Specifically, t his study will evaluate the effectiveness of the pessary 
device by [CONTACT_396622] 50 women 
with Stress Urinary Incontinence ( SUI). Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_396623], reduction of stress urinary incontinence events  
per day , and a quality of life questionnaire. The s afety of the OTC SUI 
pessary device will be evaluated by [CONTACT_396624], including 
the results of urinalysis, vaginal swab, and vaginal examination.   
 
Primary  Objective: Demonstrate effectiveness of device usage  
Important Secondary Objectives:  Device reduces epi[INVESTIGATOR_139885], 
improves quality of life, and is safe for over -the-counter (OTC) use.  
Endpoints:  
Primary  Endpoint:  Mean pad weight gain reduction per hour is >50% during 
the last 7 days of the treatment phase as compared to the baseline phase.  
Important Secondary Endpoints:  
(1) Reduction in mean number of  SUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_396594] 7- day 
baseline period to the  last [ADDRESS_498951] SUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_396595] (7 days) and treatment (14 days)  periods . Negative  values are 
indicative of efficacious outcome.  
(2) Change in Quality of Life as Measured by  [CONTACT_322708] -LUTSqol  Quality of

Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) occurs predominantly among women. SUI is characterized by 
[CONTACT_396628], laughing, 
sneezing, running, lifting or walking. SUI causes quality of life deg radation and contributes to 
women refraining from maintaining normal physical activities, and is also associated with low 
libido, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia . 
 
Currently, there are several types of treatment options for SUI such as:  
 
- Lifestyle/Behavioral changes including weight loss, pelvic floor strengthening exercises 
(Kegel), biofeedback, dietary changes and advisement to decrease fluid intake have been 
shown to have good results for motivated patients. However, it is difficult to compliance is 
relativ ely low.  
- Non-surgical treatments, including Absorbent Pads; Pessary support devices (originally 
intended to support bladder prolapse) which elevate the vesico- urethral angle, devices that 
provide urethral occlusion, and weighted cones.  
- Pharmacologic  Therapy  
- Surgical methods, including retropubic  urethropexies, suburethral slings and periurethral 
injection of bovine collagen or carbon -coated beads.1 
 
Relevant clinical research demonstrates a need for nonsurgical options for treating SUI. Since 
the ag ing populations is growing, there are more instances of incontinence. Conservative 
treatment is fundamental as it is the only type of care many patients need or can undergo.2

Approximately 25% of premenopausal and 40% of postmenopausal women suffer from urinary 
incontinence, with the peak incidence beginning at around age 45- 49. Of those dealing with 
urinary incontinence, 51% have stress urinary incontinence. Women that are Caucasian, have a 
BMI > 30 kg/m2, have been pregnant, and have had a vaginal deliv ery are at a higher risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_396596]. Intrinsic factors contributing to development of SUI include urethral musculature, 
blood flow and innervation. Extrinsic factors include degree of urethral support, patient weight, 
and degree of physical activity . 
 
Multiple treatment methods have been studied, including surgery, pharmacological treatments, 
physical/behavioral therapy, and non -surgical options such as pessaries and intravaginal 
devices. While multiple treatment options exist, less than a third of women seek intervention in 
the first [ADDRESS_498958] effective and 
durable treatment option for urinary incontinence; however, this surgery comes with physiological 
risks to the patient, high hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680], and productivity loss during recovery. While 
pharmacological options exist, they are not the standard of care in urinary incontinence treatment 
in the [LOCATION_002]. While some topi[INVESTIGATOR_396597], studies have shown both adrenergic drugs and oral hormonal treatments ineffective. One 
study revealed an 80% increase in incontinence in post -menopausal women. Not only have 
studies shown pharmacological t reatments ineffective, they also carry side effects such as nausea, 
dry mouth, and fatigue. Having nonsurgical treatments are vital so that patients have reversible, 
safer, and less costly options to try before resorting to surgical and pharmacological treatments.  
 
The primary nonsurgical and nonpharmacological options include behavioral and physical therapy, 
pessaries, and disposable, intravaginal devices, which are all relatively low risk and low cost. 
Pelvic floor muscle training combined with bladder tr aining is effective; however, it is difficult for 
patients to comply with this treatment regimen and requires more extensive physician guidance. 
Understanding predictors of success will aid in patient counseling on treatment options. 
Menopausal status, education level, UI surgery status, and incontinence frequency were 
consistently identified as predictors of success across those that used behavioral therapy, 
pessaries, and a combination of both. Women that were post -menopausal, had higher education, 
no previous UI surgery, and had low incontinence frequency were found to have the most success 
when using nonsurgical treatments.  
 
A study comparing cost utility of different treatment options revealed that incontinence pessaries 
were the most cost effective.  Pessaries have been found to increase continence by 64- 75%. 
While 50 -75% of women decline pessaries when recommended, over three quarters of patients 
that use the pessary continue to use after one year. Studies have also revealed that women do 
not perceive any difference in the effectiveness of pessary treatment versus physical therapy 
treatment; however, pessary use is also associated with pain, irritation, UTIs and difficulty in 
physician fitting of the pessary.  
 
A study performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel disposable intravaginal device 
for the treatment of SUI was performed at 2 sites in Israel. Sixty women were recruited and 
enrolled into the study and used the device for 28 – days after a 7- day control period. During the 
control peri od, preweighed pads were worn daily for [ADDRESS_498959] 14 days of the control 
period were used to allow for participants  to find the right size device. The primary endpoint was 
RS2: Disposable Stress Urinary Incontinence Pessary Device Efficacy and S afety Study  
Protocol TP -[ZIP_CODE] Rev 03  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 11 of 34 
 the percentage of women who achieved a >  70% reduction in pad weight gain (PWG) from the 
control period to the last 14 days of device usage. The results demonstrated that 85% of 
participants  met the success criteria. The device was concluded to be easy to use, well -tolerated, 
and effective in reducing SUI3. 
 
As is recommended in the Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff:  Clinical Investigations of 
Devices Indicated for the Treatment of Urinary Incontinence, t he Rinovum  Subsidiary 2, LLC. 
SUI Device Pi[INVESTIGATOR_396598] a voiding diary to document leakage occurrence 
daily. Also, as recommended in the guidance, the study will use pad- weighing to monitor efficacy 
of the device. The 24- hour test parameter w ill be used, but will be tailored to be in line with the 
amount of time the device will be used for treatment each day (12 hours). Participants  will be 
provided with ziplock bags and mailers so that used pads can be collected daily and weighed by 
[CONTACT_396629] 48 hours to determine the amount of pad weight gain (PWG). Note 
that more than 1 pad may be worn throughout each day depending on the amount of leakage 
protection required.  
 
 
 
This study is an interventional, open label, single -arm, clinical study in which participants will 
serve as their own controls. This study will  enroll participants  deemed eligible per the 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Rinovum 
Subsidiary 2 (RS -2) SUI pessary device by [CONTACT_396630] 50 women with SUI. Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_396631], 
frequency of stress urinary incontinence events, and a quality of life questionnaire. The study 
design consists of a control/no treatment period for each subject and a device treatment period 
for each subject.  
 
The participants  in this study will use the pre- weighed pads daily for [ADDRESS_498960] an 
interruption in the treatment phase such as menstrual cycle or travel. Patients will be asked to 
perform the treatment period w ithin 21 days. In both the non- treatment and treatment phase of 
the study, the preweighed pads will be collected and weighed for use in calculating pad weight 
gain (PWG).  
 
Safety analysis will include results of  urinalysis, vaginal swab, vaginal examination , and 
evaluation of adverse events.   
 
Usability of the device will be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_396599].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_396600].  
 
 
 
The risk profile of the Rinovum Subsidiary 2 SUI device is considered to be low. Risks to 
participants in this study are comparable to those routinely encountered with using vaginal

 pessaries.  The study presents no more than minimal risk of harm to partic ipants  and involves no 
procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context with a 
Class II device.  
 
Potential risks include the following short -term risks:  
• Sensitivity to the materials used in the device; however, the probability is low due to the 
design specification.  
• Injury if the user does not understand the instructions for use. Prior to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397], 
label comprehension and simulated us e testing will occur to  refine the labelling and 
demonstrate safety to proceed with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]  
• Irritation to the vaginal area 
• Vaginal bleeding/spotting 
• Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) 
• Vaginal infection 
• Urine Retention  
• Infection if the device is not us ed as indicated. For example, reuse of the device could 
put the user at risk of infection. Instructions for use will include details regarding single, 
disposable use of the device and the specifications will preclude reuse by [CONTACT_8345].  
• Confidentiality  
 
There  are no known long- term risks associated with this study.  
 
This study is a non- significant risk study. The device is not intended as an implant or for use in 
supporting or sustaining human life. The device is intended to treat by [CONTACT_396632] a disease (Stress Urinary Incontinence). Due to 
the low risk profile associated with the Rinovum Subsidiary [ADDRESS_498961], vaginal examination and urinalysis will be performed to rule out a 
pregnancy, vaginal infection, or UTI, respectively. The device will be tested the screening visit  to 
ensure fit, comfort and ability to urinate while wearing the device.  A vaginal swab will be collected 
to establish baseline vaginal microflora, but will not be used for determining eligibility to enroll. 
Participants’ most recent Pap smear withi n [ADDRESS_498962] be normal.   Each of the participants 
will receive an identification number during enrollment. This number will be the only identifying 
factor on the CRF/questionnaire.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_396601] a secure 
location.  The Sponsor shall have access to the study data after it has been de- identified to analyze 
the data to determine success of the study.  
 
Each of the devices used in this study will be labeled “Caution: Investigational device.  Limited by 
[CONTACT_120906]”.  Additionally, each device will have a specific lot number.   
 
Patient’s undergoing successful intravaginal pessary treatment for SUI have been shown to have 
improvement in quality of life,  so long as the device is being used. The quality of life improvement 
seen in patients undergoing successful SUI treatment include physical mitigation of symptoms 
which result in potential social effects, psychological effects and decrease in activity.  
 
Non-surgical treatment options are important to the subject population. SUI device interventions 
that demonstrate efficacy and safety could significantly improve the quality of life for a condition 
that most patients do not like to discuss, even with their physicians. Surgical options are typi[INVESTIGATOR_396602] a last resort, so the RS -2 SUI pessary device could provide a bridge to surgery option for

 patients. For this reason, the potential benefits associated with this study outweigh the risks 
involved.  
 
The potential benefits to participants  during this study include increased quality of life, increased 
social activity (including exercise), psychological improvement, and increased confidence due to 
decreased urinary leakage.  
   
 
 
This study is an interventional, open label, clinical study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of the Rinovum Subsidiary 2, LLC disposable SUI pessary device.  
Specifically, this study will evaluate the effectiveness of the pessary device by [CONTACT_396633] 50 women with Stress Urinary Incontinence ( SUI). 
Efficacy will be assessed by  [CONTACT_396634], reduction in the 
mean number of stress urinary incontinence events  per day , and a quality of life questionnaire. 
Primary  Objective is to demonstrate effectiveness of device usage. Important Secondary 
Objective s include demonstrating that the device reduces epi[INVESTIGATOR_396603], improves 
quality of life, and is safe for over -the-counter (OTC) use.  The safety will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_396624], including the results of urinalysis, vaginal swab, and vaginal 
examination.  
 
 
 
 
 
60 to 70 women having diagnosed stress urinary incontinence (SUI) will be recruited from 
multiple  study site s and the general population, while approximately 50 women will be included 
in the Per Protocol population. The participants  will wear preweighed pads for 7 consecutive 
days during the non-treatment (control) phase. Participants  will then use the device for 14 
consecutive days during the  treatment phase. During enrollment, before treatment phase and 
after treatment phase, a vaginal swab will be collected to determine any changes in the vaginal 
microflora of the participant.  
 
Intent to Treat Population  (ITT): Any subject enrolled who gets a pre- weighed pad for the control phase.  
This is expected to be 60- 70 subjects.  
 
Modified Intent to Treat Population (mITT): Any subject enrolled who gets through the control phase, is 
given the device and pads for the treatment period, and who uses the device such that there is at least 
one data point to analyze -  i.e., use of the pad for at least one hour during the last [ADDRESS_498963] 7 days of the treatment period is in 
the ITT population but not the mITT population.  The mITT is the population the analysis will be done on.  
 
Per Protocol Population (PP):  Any subject getting through the entire treatment period and has 
complete data (i.e., pad weight reduction data for the last 7 days of the treatment period).  For example, 
someone having only data for [ADDRESS_498964] 7 days of the treatment period is in the mITT population but 
not the PP population.  
 
Safety Population (SP):  Same as ITT.

A Serious  adverse event (SAE) is defined as an  AE or suspected  adverse reaction is 
considered "serious"  if, in the view  of either  the investigator  or sponsor, it results  in any  of the 
following outcomes:  death,  a life -threatening adverse event,  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_106156], a persistent or  significant incapacity  or substantial

The following guidelines will be used to describe  severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily  activities.  
• Moderate  – Events  result  in a low level of inconvenience or concern  with the 
therapeutic  measures.  Moderate events  may cause some  interference  with 
functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or  incapacitating.

 The PI’s assessment  of an AE's  relationship  to study device is part  of the documentation  
process, but it is not  a factor  in determining what is  or is not  reported  in the  study. If there is  
any doubt as  to whether a clinical observation is an  AE, the event  should be reported. All AEs 
must  have their relationship to study agent  assessed. In  a clinical trial, the study product  must  
always be suspect. To  help assess, the following  guidelines  are used.  
 
• Related – The AE  is known  to occur  with the study  agent,  there  is a reasonable 
possibility  that the study  agent  caused  the AE, or there  is a temporal  relationship 
between the study  agent  and event.  Reasonable possibility  means  that there  is 
evidence to suggest a causal  relationship  between the study  agent  and the AE. 
• Not Related – There  is not a reasonable possibility  that the administration of the 
study  agent  caused  the event,  there  is no temporal relationship between the study  
agent  and event  onset,  or an alternate  etiology  has been established.

means, medians, standard deviations, minimums and maximums.  Categorical variables will be 
summarized using the number of observations and percentages.  p- values will be reported, 
where appropriate, to four decimal places.  
 
Intermediate calculations will not be rounded.   Internal computer precision will be kept and the 
final values will then be output, formatted to the relevant whole number and decimal precision.   
 
10.3   Sample Size and Study Outcome Determination 
 
A precision approach will be used to determine the appropriate sample size and power for t he 
study.  For power and sample size considerations a type 1 error rate (alpha) of 0.05, one- sided, 
will be used.  Given a sample size of [ADDRESS_498981] 
deviations to show power below and above 90% (see Table 1 bel ow).  Sixty to seventy 
participants will be enrolled to allow for the fifty per -protocol participants, although the analyses 
will be done on the mITT population.   
 10          STATISTICA L  CONSIDERATIONS 
RS2: Disposable Stress Urinary Incontinence Pessary Device Efficacy and S afety Study  
Protocol TP -[ZIP_CODE] Rev 03  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 25 of 34 
 The assumptions made for the power and sample size computations come from the Poise study 
(Ziv et al), where their assumption for the effect size was reduction in pad weight gain per 8 
hours of 70%, with a standard deviation of 15%.  The results of the study showed an 86% 
reduction in pad weight gain per 8 hours with a 9% standard deviation.  Gi ven those results, this 
study’s assumptions of 60% improvement and a range of standard deviations from 15% to 20% 
appear conservative; thus, the expected results would indicate a successful outcome for the 
primary endpoint.  
 
The computations below are based on the precision method, which in the case of this study 
computes a lower 95% confidence limit for the percentage change.  Here we consider a changes 
around 60% in the explanation of the table.  Different standard deviations are used with the 
sample size of 50.  
 
Table 1.  
 
  n                   ½ width       Std        
                          of CI         Dev        Power  
 
  [ADDRESS_498982] entry in the table shows that if the resulting mean reduction in pad weight gain was 60% 
and the standard deviation of the mean percentage change was 16%, the lower limit of the 95% 
confidence interval for 60% would be 55%: 60% - 5% (½ width), wi th 99.9% probability (power).  
The last line in the table above shows that the resulting mean percentage change would have to 
be greater than 56 for the power to be 99.5% (56% -  6% ½ width = 50%, not greater than 50%) if 
the standard deviation was 20%.  If  the result was 60% the lower limit of the confidence interval 
would be 54%: (60% -  6%) with 99.5% power. Thus, for all lines above except 4 and 5 the 
endpoint was reached with greater than 90% power.   
 
A successful outcome for this endpoint would be any result where the lower limit of the 95% 
confidence interval is above 50% with more than 90% power, as explained above.  When the 
results are tabulated, another table will be created with the n’s and standard deviations from the 
study for comparison to the study results.   
 
Also, this sample size should also be sufficient for inferential analysis of the secondary 
endpoints.  
 
10.4   Statistical Hypotheses and Data Description  
 
1. Type 1 Error and Multiplicity Concerns:  
The inferential tests for the one primary and two secondary endpoints were initially conceived to 
be one- sided using alpha=0.05.  Since the sponsor wishes to use the success of all three for 
labeling and marketing purposes, a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons will be 
employed. Thus, st atistical significance will be indicated for each endpoint if the p- value is less 
than 0.0167.

Protocol TP -[ZIP_CODE] Rev 03  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 26 of 34 
 2. Primary Endpoint:  
There is one primary endpoint, for efficacy.  The objective is to show that reduction in the mean 
pad weight gain per hour is >50% in the treatment period.  Thus, the null hypothesis is that the 
mean weight gain reduction per hour is <=50%, and the alternative is that it is >50%, from the 
control period (no device) to the treatment period (women wearing the device).  The data values 
will be com puted for each woman as:  
 
[(total weight of all pads worn during the treatment period/hrs. pads are worn during 
treatment)  
 
minus  
 
(total weight of all pads worn during the control period/ hrs. pads are worn during 
control)]  
 
The above quantity divided by  
(total weight of all pads worn during the control period/ hrs. pads are worn during 
control)  
 
This resulting quantity is then multiplied by 100.  
 
Ex.  Subject’s total pad weight for control period is 140 grams.  Pads were worn for a total of 100 
hours. Wei ght/hr. is 140/100 = 1.4 g/hr.  Subject’s total pad weight for treatment period is [ADDRESS_498983] wore pads for 100 hours.  Pad weight per hour is 60/100 is 0.6 g/hr.  Difference, 
treatment – control is 0.6 - 1.4 = - 0.8 g/hr.  For the percent change, 100*( -0.8/1.4) =  
-57.143%.  Therefore the reduction in pad weight gain is 57.143%.  
 
The null hypothesis will be that the mean reduction in pad weight gain per hour is less than or 
equal to 50%, with the alternative that it is greater than 50%.  If the raw percentage change data 
appear to be normally distributed, a paired t -test will be used to test the hypothesis.  If not, see 
section 10.6 (2).  
 
The precision method will be utilized to determine success.  The precision approach creates a 
lower bound for a confidence interval that is higher than the reference, in this case 50%.  This 
50% standard was chosen based on the FDA guidance document.   
 
Power and sample size calculations determine scenarios of success. When the resulting mean 
reduction in pad weight gain per hour is quantified, its lower limit of a (1 -0.0167)% confidence 
level is determined.  This value is then compared to parameters determined to be efficacious in 
the sample size calculations (section 10.3).  It is expected that the mean reduction per  hour will 
be >50% such that the lower limit of the confidence interval for that result will be higher than 
50% with adequate power to suggest success for the study.   
 
3. Secondary Endpoints:  
 
a. For the change in SUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_396612] a change in the 
number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_396613].   
Specifically, the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_396614].  For 
the control phase, there will be (at most) [ADDRESS_498984].  The same measures 
RS2: Disposable Stress Urinary Incontinence Pessary Device Efficacy and S afety Study  
Protocol TP -[ADDRESS_498985] a mean number of SUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_914].  If the pads are 
not worn for the entire time specified during a day, the fraction of the day the 
pads are worn will be used in computing the number of days.  Therefore, there 
will be, say, 50 differences comprised of mean number  of SUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_396615].  (These numbers will likely be negative.)  The mean of these [ADDRESS_498986] -treatment visit.  The changes will likely be negative scores as the QOL 
is expected to improve, as the instrument records lower numbers as indicating a 
better quality of life.  For the purposes of inferential analysis, a mixed model 
analysis of var iance on the scores will be used on the result at time t 
(t=baseline, post -control, post -treatment) with time as a fixed effect and subject 
as a random effect.  Thus, the null hypothesis is that there is no significant 
difference from baseline/enrollment t o post -treatment, i.e., that the mean 
change in score is 0.  The alternative is that this change is less than 0.  
Correlation of scores within subjects will be considered as compound 
symmetric.  The p -value indicating the significance of the least square m ean 
score at the third time- point compared to that at the first time- point will 
determine if the endpoint is met.  
 
All inferential testing will be done on the mITT population and will be one- sided.  As noted 
above statistical significance will be reached i f the relevant p- value is less than 0.0167.  
Results for all populations will be reported.  
 
There is a secondary safety endpoint as described earlier in the protocol.  Safety reporting 
using urinalysis, vaginal swab, vaginal examination, and evaluation wil l be descriptive and 
narrative in nature.    
 
Similarly, exploratory endpoint results of comfort and successful use will be descriptive.  No 
inferential hypotheses will be used here.

 10.6   Description of Statistical Methods  
 
1. Adjustment for non- normality:  
 
a. The primary endpoint analysis is based on the mean pad weight reduction per 
hour as a percent having a normal distribution.  Values will be checked for 
normality via the Kolmorgorov Smirnov test, and a transformation may be needed 
prior to the analysis.  F irst the percent change from baseline will be examined, 
and if the data are not normally distributed then a log transform of the ratio of the 
post-treatment result to the post -control will be utilized.  The standard error of this 
logged quantity and result ing lower bound of the 1-  (adjusted alpha) confidence 
interval will be determined.  Then this lower bound will be exponentiated to get 
the ratio in the original data units.  [ADDRESS_498988] -control result.  
Subtracting this result from 100% will give the lowest percentage value needed to 
achieve statistical significance.  If this lower bound is greater than 50% and the 
raw percent change from baseline is greater than this result then the primary 
endpoint has been reached.  
 
The expected results suggest that the percent change from baseline should be 
normal, thus validating the sample siz e and power calculations.  Since those 
assumptions are conservative it is felt that any transformation of the data and 
subsequent modification of the analysis (e.g., see adjustment for site below) still 
allow for this endpoint to have sufficient power.  
 
b. Secondary Endpoints:   
 
i. Should the difference in SUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_396616] -normal then the natural log 
of the baseline and treatment phase scores will be taken and the natural 
log of the ratio of the post -treatment result to that of the baseline will be 
analyzed i n the same fashion as described in “a” above.  A raw difference 
of 0 would translate to a ratio of 1.0 after exponentiation back. Since the 
difference is expected to be negative, the upper bound of the raw 
(transformed back) is compared to 1.  If it is les s than the endpoint has 
been reached, indicating that the treatment mean is statistically 
significantly less than the control mean.  
ii. If the scores of the QOL indicate a significant difference from normality 
then a natural log transformation will be done and modeled  
 
2. For the other secondary analysis (safety outcomes examination) descriptive and 
possibly narrative results will be presented.  For the exploratory outcomes of comfort 
and successful usage results will be reported similarly.    Details will appear  in the 
SAP.

 Results for the primary and secondary endpoints will be presented in tables, with continuous 
data exhibited via descriptive summaries (n, mean (std), median, min, max); n will be a whole 
number, means, medians, and minimum and maximum values will have one decimal place, and 
standard deviation will have two.  Categorical measures (counts) reported as n (%), with n being 
a whole number and the percent having one decimal place.   
 
As mentioned above, the analyses for the primary and two secondary  endpoints will be done on 
the mITT population and no imputation should be necessary.  For the primary endpoint and the 
SUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_396617], by [CONTACT_108], the subject must have participated on one day 
of the treatment period; therefore, there will be a pad weight gain per hour measure and 
(conceivably) a diary entry for the number of SUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; both of these would be the values for 
analysis for that subject.  If they are not retrievable then they are missing.  If a withdrawing mITT 
subject i s able to complete the quality of life questionnaire that data would be used; if not that 
subject has a missing value for the post -treatment QOL score.  Should participants withdraw 
replacements will be utilized until [ADDRESS_498989].  A p -value of <= 0.[ADDRESS_498990]’s change in mean number of 
SUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_914].  
 
For the quality of life repeated measures ANOVA site will again be included in the model as a 
fixed effect.  
 
Should site become statistically significant in any of the analyses then it will be used as a fixed 
effect factor in all three analyses, and the appropriate percentage and mean changes (or log 
transformations implementing those analyses)  will be extracted from the output created by [CONTACT_396642].

will include a summary table, a system organ class/preferred term table, and tables for 
relationship and severity to study treatments.

peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed 
Central upon acceptance for  publication.  
 
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have 
adopted a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a 
clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human pa rticipants  to 
intervention or concurrent comparison or control groups to study the cause -and-effect 
RS2: Disposable Stress Urinary Incontinence Pessary Device Efficacy and S afety Study  
Protocol TP -[ADDRESS_498996] of 2007, 
requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov , 
which is sponsored by [CONTACT_1055]. Other biomedi cal journals are 
considering adopting similar policies. For interventional clinical trials performed under NIH IC 
grants and cooperative agreements, it is the grantee’s responsibility to register the trial in an 
acceptable registry, so the research results  may be considered for publication in ICMJE 
member journals. The ICMJE does not review specific studies to determine whether 
registration is necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have 
questions about the need to register err on the side of registration or consult the editorial 
office of the journal in which they wish to publish.  
 
FDAAA mandates that a "responsible party" (i.e., the sponsor or designated principal 
investigator) register and report results of certain "applicable cl inical trials":  
 
• Trials  of Drugs  and Biologics:  Controlled,  clinical investigations,  other  than Phase I 
investigations,  of a product subject  to FDA regulation;  
• Trials  of Devices: Controlled trials  with health outcomes  of a product  subject  to FDA 
regulation (other  than small  feasibility  studies)  and pediatric  post-market  
surveillance studies.  
 
NIH grantees must take specific steps to ensure compliance with NIH implementation of  
FDAAA.]  
 
 
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence, such as by [CONTACT_81477], is critical. Therefore, any actual conflict of interest of persons who

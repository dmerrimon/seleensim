Version 11-4-2022  PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
 
Synopsis 
 
Skeletal muscle loss and impairment – prominent features of the aging process – lead to physical disability. 
There is plausible evidence that altering components of the diet, mainly protein intake  and acid/base balance , 
may improve indices of muscle health in older adults and thus translate to a reduction in physical disability. A 
growing number of studies suggest that increasing protein intake using a whey protein supplement may benefit 
muscle health in older adults. However, a main concern is that high protein results in a large dietary acid load 
from the breakdown of protein to acidogenic by[CONTACT_133294], which could in turn promote muscle degradation 
particularly in older adults with age-related declines in renal excretion of acid. Thus, our hypothesis is that the 
balance between the amount of protein in the diet (anabolic component) and the net acid load of the diet 
(catabolic component) in part determines whether the diet as a whole has a net anabolic or catabolic effect on 
muscle. Preliminary data from our group have suggested that a daily potassium bicarbonate (KHCO 3) 
supplement improved lower extremity muscle power in postmenopausal women. Based on our preliminary data, 
we plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial study in which underactive men 
and women age 65 and older on baseline lower protein diets will be enrolled. Participants will be assigned to 
one of four groups: either a whey protein supplement (to raise protein intake to 1.5 g/kg/d) with or without KHCO 3 
81 mmol/d or an isocaloric placebo supplement with or without KHCO 3 81 mmol/d for 24 wks. The primary 
outcome is lower extremity muscle power at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes are lower extremity muscle power 
at 12 weeks, knee extension strength/torque at 12 and 24 weeks, physical performance at 24 weeks, lean mass 
at 24 weeks, and 24-hr urinary nitrogen excretion adjusted for nitrogen intake at 24 weeks. Exploratory outcomes 
will include a measure of muscle mass – D 3-creatine dilution – and how it correlates with the older method – lean 
mass. Our central hypothesis is that higher protein intake and a neutralizing alkaline salt will improve muscle 
performance and mass, compared to their respective placebos, in older men and postmenopausal women. If 
successful, this research could result in a paradigm shift in dietary advice to older adults to reduce physical 
disability. As 1 in 5 US adults will be over age 65 by [CONTACT_68089] 2040, a safe dietary intervention that reduces age-
related musculoskeletal decline will be an important preventative health step for our aging society.

Version 11-4-2022  INTRODUCTION  
 
Study Rationale 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037]1-5 report that older adults with protein intakes ≥1.2 g/kg/d have significantly greater lean 
mass and muscle performance than those consuming 0.8 g/kg/d (Recommended Daily Allowance, RDA) or less. 
A recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_476478] 0.8 to >1.2 g/kg/d 
improved physical function as measured by a short physical performance battery (SPPB) over [ADDRESS_610965] age-related decline in renal function causing decreased renal excretion of acid; thus, high 
dietary protein potentiates a low-grade metabolic acidosis17 that could limit the anabolic effect of protein.  It is 
currently unknown whether reducing the acid load of higher protein intakes allows protein to have an enhanced 
effect on skeletal muscle health.  
 
Alkalinogenic foods (e.g., fruits and vegetables) that lower dietary acid load, are linked to better muscle health.18-
23 A surrogate for alkalinogenic foods is an alkaline salt supplement (i.e. potassium bicarbonate KHCO 3). Our 
group found a significant improvement in lower extremity muscle power and endurance following 12 wks of a 
HCO 3 supplement in younger postmenopausal women.24 HCO 3 also reduced 24h urinary nitrogen excretion (UNi; 
a marker of muscle breakdown) in postmenopausal women on self-selected diets.[ADDRESS_610966] of HCO 3 
supplementation combined with high protein intake on muscle health in older adults?   
 
Our 6-wk randomized, protein cross-over, controlled feeding pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]15 found that increasing dietary protein up to 
1.5 g/kg/d and KHCO 3 at 90 mmol/d reduced by [CONTACT_34120] 50% the rise in UNi that accompanied a higher protein 
intake in both men and postmenopausal women suggesting a decrease in muscle breakdown. Our most recent 
trial25 found better tolerability with an 81 mmol/d dose of KHCO 3 without compromising efficacy, thus making the 
81 mmol/d dose more desirable in a longer-term study. Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_476479], a plausible hypothesis that we aim to test in this larger study is that a high protein intake and 
KHCO [ADDRESS_610967] a 24-wk, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 2x2 factorial study in

Version 11-4-2022  Exploratory Aims:  
To test the individual and additive effects of supplemental whey protein (to achieve 1.5 g/kg/d) and/or KHCO 3 81 
mmol/d on 24-wk changes in muscle mass as measured by D 3-creatine dilution; 
 
Background 
Age-related muscle loss.  After age 50, muscle mass declines at a rate of 1-2% per year26,27 in association with 
a decrease in muscle strength of about 3% per year.28-30 By [CONTACT_654] 65 years and over, more than 30% of adults 
experience falls, loss of independence, or physical disability.31,32 These factors need to be considered in the 
context of a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_476480], which is projected to increase from 12% in 2000 to 20% in [ADDRESS_610968] decade. 
 
Protein and muscle . Protein is a main building block of skeletal muscle. According to the Institute of Medicine 
in 2005, the RDA for all adults young and old is for 0.8 g/kg/d.34 Yet, a series of recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_476481].1-5,35-37 Older US adults with protein intakes ≥1.2 g/kg/d had 43% less loss of lean mass 
by [CONTACT_476504] a 3-year period compared to those with lower intakes closer to the current RDA of 0.8 g/kg/d.5 A 
separate Finnish observational study found that older women with protein intakes ≥1.2 g/kg/d had greater muscle 
strength (as measured by [CONTACT_476505], one-leg stance, chair rise, walking speed for 10m) and higher 
SPPB scores compared with those with moderate and lower intakes of ≤0.8 g/kg/d. This discrepancy in dietary 
protein needs in older adults compared to a younger adult population is, at least in part, rooted in the concept of 
aging-related anabolic resistance,38 which is defined as an impaired muscle protein anabolic response to a meal 
resulting in inadequate muscle protein synthesis. Augmenting dietary protein provides the needed amino acid 
substrate to stimulate muscle protein synthesis39 and it stimulates the production of muscle growth factors, such 
as IGF-1. In older patients with recent hip fractures, 20 g/d of protein supplement increased serum IGF-1 levels.40 
Our group also found that increasing protein intake from 0.8 to 1.5 g/kg/d significantly increased serum IGF-[ADDRESS_610969] shown favorable results of adding protein intake up to 1.5 g/kg/d to an 
exercise training intervention on skeletal muscle mass, strength and performance.7,9,[ADDRESS_610970] been scarce. 
A recent randomized controlled trial found that older obese nonexercised adults on a high protein (>1.2 g/kg/d) 
hypocaloric diet versus a lower ≤0.8 g/kg/d protein diet, had better physical function as measured by [CONTACT_476506] 24 wks.6  Conversely, a different study showed no benefit in lean mass or muscle performance with a single 
30 g bolus of whey protein after 2 yrs, but notably all participants were allowed to be on higher protein uptakes 
<1.5 g/kg/d in this trial which may have washed out the ability to see a difference between the low and high 
protein groups.[ADDRESS_610971] that protein supplements need to be distributed throughout the day with a meal44-49 rather 
than in a single bolus. 
 
There are concerns that high protein intake induce a mild chronic metabolic acidosis in an older population with 
age-related declines in renal function.17 Due to the breakdown of dietary protein to acidogenic sulfur-containing 
amino acids, high protein diets result in a large dietary acid load.13 An aging population whose declines in renal

Version 11-4-2022  function result in impaired renal acid excretion are prone to a low-grade chronic metabolic acidosis. Dietary 
protein’s acidogenic effect was shown in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_187337] 1.5 g/kg of protein from meat sources with a 3-fold 
increase in 24h urinary net acid excretion (NAE), an established measure of endogenous acid load.15 Another 
key determinant of dietary acid load is the potential renal acid load (PRAL).13,14 In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], the PRAL of the 1.5 
g/kg/d diet was +16 based on a 60 kg individual.15 The quantity of whey isolate used in our proposal has a similar 
PRAL estimate of +15 to the meat-based intervention in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]; thus, we expect our whey intervention to have 
a similar acidogenic impact. An acidic environment is an established stimulus for muscle catabolism.[ADDRESS_610972] raised is: Does targeting the dietary acid load of high protein diets with alkalinogenic 
foods or supplements enhance the anabolic benefits of the high protein in an otherwise healthy older adult 
population? 
 
Alkali and muscle.  Alkalinogenic foods (e.g., fruits and vegetables) that lower dietary acid load, are linked to 
better muscle health.18-[ADDRESS_610973] tertile 
of consumption of fruits and vegetables, had a lower odds ratio for sarcopenia (measured by [CONTACT_11324]) than those 
in the lowest tertile.55 Another recent study from the [LOCATION_006] found positive associations between women on the 
Mediterranean diet (rich in fruits and vegetables) and leg power and percent lean mass by [CONTACT_11324].56 Other 
observational studies in older adults found similar positive associations between Mediterranean-style diet and 
SPPB score.57 
 
A surrogate for alkalinogenic foods is an alkaline salt supplement (i.e. KHCO 3). Currently, there are few data 
describing the impact of dietary alkali on muscle health in older adults. The earliest study was conducted in 
postmenopausal women on standardized high protein diets treated with an alkaline KHCO 3 supplement of 60-
120 mmol/d for 18-days followed by a 12-day recovery.58 With reductions in NAE from KHCO 3 there were 
concomitant reductions in UNi and vice versa during the KHCO 3 withdrawal period.58 In our trial, we also found 
that postmenopausal women on self-selected diets treated with HCO 3 had significant reductions in NAE and 
UNi.24 A similar pattern was noted in the men but it did not reach statistical significance. Further, we found that 
women on HCO 3 significantly improved lower extremity muscle power (as measured by [CONTACT_476507]) and 
isokinetic muscle endurance of knee extensors (as measured by [CONTACT_476508]) following 12 wks vs placebo.24 
 
Based on the data on protein and alkali for muscle health, we conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_476482] a high protein diet (1.5 g/kg/d) with an alkaline salt KHCO 3 (90 mmol/d) favored the 
enhancement of intermediate indices of muscle metabolism.15 Although the sample was small (19 adults age 50 
yrs and over), this 6-wk protein-crossover randomized-controlled study showed that KHCO 3 decreased the 
protein-induced rise in UNi by 50% compared to placebo. Furthermore, both the increase in protein intake and 
the alkali showed increases in serum IGF-[ADDRESS_610974] recent KHCO 3 trial,25 we found 
excellent tolerability of a slightly lower, 81 mmol/d, dose of KHCO 3 compared to the 90 mmol/d in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], thus, 
making the 81 mmol/d more feasible in a longer-term study without compromising efficacy. The impact of these 
two dietary factors on muscle performance and mass  has not been studied to date.   
 
RISK BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
 
Known Potential Risks to Participants 
Potential of KHCO 3 to cause hyperkalemia 
Administration of 81 mmol/d could cause significant hyperkalemia in older patients with advanced chronic kidney 
disease; however, in our study population with mild age-related renal declines, it is much less likely.

HNRCA Study # 3010

Version 11-4-2022  In our recent trial in 233 men and women age 60 years and older,25 participants were randomized to treatment 
with placebo, 81 mmol/d or 122 mmol/d of KHCO 3 and followed for 12 wks. Each participant had a safety serum 
potassium (K) level measured on study days 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 50, and on the final visit.  
 
The results of these measurements are summarized in the table below. 
 
 Placebo  81 mmol dose  122 mmol dose  
N 79 79 75 
    
Serum K measures  553 553 525 
    
Initially elevated  9 7 13 
    
Confirmed elevated  1 1 5 
As shown in the Table above, confirmed hyperkalemia occurred in one person in the placebo group (serum K 
5.8 mEq/L, reference range 3.5-5.3 mEq/L), one person in the 81 mmol/d dose group (serum K 5.8 mEq/L), and 
5 persons in the 122 mmol/d dose group (5.4, 5.5, 5.5, 5.7, and 5.8 mEq/L).   
 
Given the very large number of measurements, the occurrences in the placebo and 81 mmol/d dose groups 
likely occurred by [CONTACT_3364]. Mean serum K levels did not change significantly during the study in any group. 
Baseline and final mean (±SEM) serum potassium levels were 4.4±0.03 (SEM) and 4.3±0.03 meq/L in the 
placebo group, 4.4±0.04 and 4.5±0.03 meq/L in the 81 mmol/d group, and 4.4±0.04 and 4.4±0.04 meq/L in the 
122 mmol/d group. This is consistent with the experience of others. Sebastian et al. reported that 90 mmol/d of 
KHCO 3 increased serum K levels only modestly and within the reference range (from 3.9 ± 0.15 to 4.03 ± 0.20 
mEq/L; reference range 3.5-5.3 mEq/L) in postmenopausal women age 50 to 77 yrs.59 Sellmeyer et al. 
administered 90 mmol/d of Kcitrate to 60 postmenopausal women.60 She did not measure (or at least did not 
report) serum K values, but exclusion criteria for her study included a 2-hr creatinine clearance of <40 ml/min.60 
Moseley administered 90 mmol of Kcitrate daily for 6 months to 52 postmenopausal women and reported one 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_476483] 40 mmol/d.61 From our previous work and 
the experience of others, we conclude that there is minimal risk of hyperkalemia from KHCO 3 supplements in 
the dose we plan to give in the proposed trial, 81 mmol/d.  
 
Potential of KHCO 3 to cause alkalosis 
The dose of bicarbonate to be administered is not expected to produce alkalosis in participants with normal 
baseline serum HCO 3- levels and GFR ≥ 50 ml/min at entry, as in this study. In our recent trial, treatment with 81 
mmol/d for 84 days increased serum HCO 3- levels from 25.3±0.27 to 25.9±0.27 mmol/L and treatment with 122 
mmol/d increased mean HCO 3- levels from 25.0±0.30 to 25.9±0.22 mmol/L (our reference range is 21-33 
mmol/L). No epi[INVESTIGATOR_476484].  This is consistent with a metabolic 
study in which Sebastian administered 60 to 120 mmol/d of KHCO 3 and reported that plasma HCO3- increased 
from 23.7±1.3 to 25.6±1.3 mmol/L, a value that was well within their normal range of 22 to 29 mmol/L 59.  
 
Tolerability of KHCO 3 
Of the 233 participants in our recent trial, 5 participants stopped taking their pi[INVESTIGATOR_476485] - 2 in the placebo group, 1 in the 81 mmol/d group, and 2 in the 122 mmol/d group.25 Adherence with 
the study capsules averaged 92.2% in the placebo group, 91.3% in the 81 mmol/d KHCO 3 group, and 87.4% in 
the 122 mmol/d KHCO [ADDRESS_610975] that the 81 mmol/d dose of KHCO 3 we plan 
to give in the proposed study will be well-tolerated.  
 
Tolerability of whey protein and placebo isocaloric maltodextrin powder 
Whey protein powder and its isocaloric placebo powder will be prepared by [CONTACT_476509]. The powder will be flavorless and sample recipes on how to incorporate it into a beverage or meal will 
be provided to the participants to maximize tolerability.

Version 11-4-2022  Blood draws 
Samples to be obtained include blood. Expected risks associated with blood draws may include slight discomfort 
on puncturing of the skin and possible bruising at the site. Uncommon or rare risks may include phlebitis and/or 
scarring. The amount of blood to be drawn, 15 ml for the screening tests and will not exceed 90 ml during the 
study, is well within the limit for research participants (maximum allowable <500 ml over 8 weeks according to 
American Red Cross). 
 
DXA scans 
Radiation exposure to the region of interest is less than 1 mrem/0.[ADDRESS_610976] two DXA scans during the 24 week study period which will total 1 mrem/0.01 mSv. The 
exposure is less than the amount of natural background radiation received over 5 days at sea level. 
 
Muscle Strength and Physical Performance Testing 
Risk of injury from testing of physical capacity is very low. The only risk expected to be associated with these 
tests is a risk of losing balance during the gait speed. The examiner will remain close to help volunteers who are 
unsteady. 
 
D3-Creatine Dilution 
This is an oral dose of deuterium-labelled creatine (stable isotope) to determine total skeletal muscle mass via 
estimation of total body creatine pool size. Giving 60 mg of D 3-creatine has no known side effects.  
 
Known Potential Benefits to Participants 
This study is not designed to benefit individual participants. Screening lab results will be made available to the 
participants. If any adverse medical conditions are discovered during the study, participants will be notified in 
person or by [CONTACT_476510]/PI, [CONTACT_109194]. If the adverse condition is mild, the participant will 
be referred to their doctor for an clinic evaluation. If the adverse condition is severe, the participant will be referred 
to urgent care or the emergency room. 
  
Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits 
The risks incurred are minimal relative to the potential benefit of gaining information about one’s health. 
 
OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 
 
We propose to conduct a 2x2 factorial design single center double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial. We 
plan to enroll 300 participants to obtain 120 completers. Each treatment arm will aim to include 30 participants. 
 
Treatment Arms: 
 Arm 1: Whey protein packet + KHCO 3 supplement 
 Arm 2: Whey protein packet + placebo supplement 
 Arm 3: Isocaloric placebo packet + KHCO 3 supplement 
 Arm 4: Isocaloric placebo packet + placebo supplement 
 
The primary outcome is the lower extremity muscle power at 24 weeks as measured by [CONTACT_476511]. 
Secondary outcomes are lower extremity power at 12 weeks, knee extension torque at 12 and 24 weeks, and 
handgrip strength, physical performance as measured by [CONTACT_476512], appendicular non-bone non-fat 
lean tissue mass as measured by [CONTACT_476513], and 24-h urinary nitrogen excretion adjusted for 
nitrogen intake at 24 weeks. Our exploratory outcome is muscle mass as measured by D 3-creatine dilution at 24 
weeks.

RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION 
 
This team has successfully recruited for KHCO [ADDRESS_610982], including:  
 
Local recruitment methods: 
1) We will identify appropriate potential candidates (i.e., those who meet our age criteria and whose 
participation in prior studies would not make them ineligible) in the HNRCA Recruitment database, and 
send them a recruitment letter and an email. We will also send a modified recruitment letter and email to 
potential candidates who received a recruitment letter for this study >[ADDRESS_610983]. Interested individuals may call or reply via email for more information about the study and their 
potential eligibility (opt in). A follow up call or email will be made to those people who do not reply. A 
voicemail will be left for those who do not answer the telephone. 
2) We will also recruit subjects with use of mailing lists purchased from Act One Lists, Marblehead, MA 
(available by [CONTACT_654], sex, and zip code). This involves contact[CONTACT_476514] a brief description of the study and the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Interested candidates will 
call. An advertisement will be run in local newspapers, giving a call-in number to the Bone Metabolism 
Lab for more information, as above.  Flyers with a brief study description and contact [CONTACT_476515], churches, subways, buses, and senior 
centers. Written permission will be obtained from supermarkets, churches, senior centers, and Tufts 
Medical Center before flyers will be placed there. These permissions will be collected and retained by 
[CONTACT_175545]. For subway and bus ads, we will purchase the advertising space/time 
and submit our IRB-approved ads to the MBTA. Posting of IRB-approved, study-specific flyers on bulletin 
boards at HNRCA is the responsibility of the Recruitment Department, and their posting of such flyers 
constitutes HNRCA permission. 
3) We will also send recruitment letters to individuals whose electronic medical record at Tufts Medical 
Center (TMC) indicates that they are 65 years and over with a GFR >60. We will query the Tufts Medical 
Center's Research Data Warehouse (TRDW)  (https://www.tuftsctsi.org/research-
services/informatics/tufts-medical-center-research-data-warehouse/  ) to identify eligible patient 
population.  The TRDW is a centralized clinical data warehouse that aggregates clinical information from 
various Tufts Medical Center's systems.  We will query the system using the ICD10 (CPT, [other]) codes 
for concepts required to conduct a study.  If feasibility is confirmed, we will request patient names, contact 
[CONTACT_3031], demographics, and diagnostic codes to facilitate recruitment. Once potential participants are 
identified we will use IRB approved recruitment materials for the process.  
 
Telephone Prescreening:  
Interested candidates will be invited to call our dedicated line at the HNRCA. They will have a prescreening 
telephone interview about their medical history, height and weight. A short physical activity questionnaire (RAPA) 
and a short diet questionnaire will be administered. Interested and potentially eligible candidates will be invited 
to HNRCA for a screening visit. Screening will consist of: a comprehensive medical history and supplement use 
questionnaire, physical measures, an EKG, fasting blood chemistries including serum Cr, K, HCO-, and a dietary 
consultation. Participants who pass the screening evaluation will be enrolled. 
 
Screening visit: 
Screening and enrollment procedures as well as documents related to MRU standard policies and procedures, 
approved under IRB #6701 , will be used for this protocol. Interested candidates will undergo a brief medical 
evaluation, a fasting lab draw, and electrocardiogram to assess eligibility. If a candidate screened for HNRCA

Version 11-4-2022  study 3035 (IRB #[ZIP_CODE]) in the prior 4 weeks but deemed ineligible, screening labs and electrocardiogram can 
be applied to this study’s screening evaluation in order to reduce burden of repeat testing. 
 
Payment plan:  
Each participant who completes the screening process will be paid $25. Each participant who completes the 
study will be paid an additional $1000 for transportation and miscellaneous expenses. Of this, $200 will be given 
after the completion of the enrollment and baseline visits, $100 will be given after the 6 week visit, $250 will be 
given after the 12 week visit, $100 will be given after 18 week visit, and $[ADDRESS_610984] is taking an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin II 
receptor blocker (ARB) or a potassium-sparing diuretic, they will receive an added $[ADDRESS_610985] needs to remain in the study for up to 10 extra days for any reason (such as snow 
days, unrelated minor illness, unanticipated schedule change), he/she will continue on the study, however the 
stipend will not be increased. If a subject drops out of the study or is obliged to skip any of the visits, his/her 
payment will be pro-rated to the portion of the protocol that he/she completed according to the payment schedule 
described above. The HNRCA will mail a check to participants about two to three weeks after each visit. 
 
Retention:  
Steps to encourage retention include: a welcoming and cordial environment on each study visit and recipes that 
contain information about how to incorporate the powder packets into each meal throughout the study. All 
participants  will be counseled by [CONTACT_476516] (weeks 6, 
12, 18) to promote adherence to their usual protein intake and to the powder packets. For study pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], participants 
will record compliance in diaries and return these diaries at each visit. Nursing staff will also perform pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685]. 
Diaries will also be kept for the powder packets. Participants will contact [CONTACT_476517] (scheduling, etc). More objective adherence measures 
for the whey protein intervention will be recorded in 24h UNi measurements, and for the KHCO 3 intervention will 
be recorded in 24h net acid excretion (NAE) measurements.

a  Two-item protein intake questionnaire on telephone prescreening.  
b To recruit participants who are underactive at baseline, we will use the RAPA, a validated 9-item questionnaire at 
prescreening and recruit those with scores <5. Intrastudy, changes in physical activity could modify the anticipated 
responses to treatment. Therefore, we will assess leisure, household, and occupational activity in the past 40 days with 
use of the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) questionnaire with 10 items and a score ranging from 0 to 400 
with higher scores reflecting greater levels of activity at Baseline and Final Day 2.64 
c A stable deuterium (D 3)-labelled creatine capsule (60 mg) will be administered to participants at the Enrollment and Final 
Day [ADDRESS_610987] a 
second void of fasting morning urine for analysis of creatine to creatinine on the supplements early in the course of the 
study. This is to measure the creatine component coming from the diet load. 
d Three consecutive 24-hr dietary recalls will be done for 3 days at the beginning of the study (between the Enrollment 
and Baseline visits). The third recall day will coincide with the 24-hr urine collected. We will also collect 24-hr recalls on 
weeks 6, 12, 18, and Final Day 2 to track their diet during the study. 
e Our research dietitian will counsel participants on how to mix the powder packets in water at Baseline and provide a 
variety of flavors. On weeks 6, 12, and 18, the dietitian will be providing counseling to maintain protein intake in self-
selected diets intra-study.

 Five 5-ml aliquots will be archived at the Baseline and Final 2 visits. 
i Capsules of KHCO 3/placebo and Ca/D supplements dispensed. Participants will take 1 capsule after each meal for 14 
days (to adapt to the KHCO 3) and then increase to 2 after each meal (6/d total) thereafter. 
j  Protein packets will be dispensed by [CONTACT_476518]. Subjects will take the whey protein supplement with each meal 
except on the days 164 and 168 (Final Days 1 and 2) when they will skip the packet with their evening meal. The goal of 
the packets is to bring total intake of protein to 1.5 g/kg/d (or 15-25 g of additional protein with each meal depending on 
body weight). 
k Adherence to study pi[INVESTIGATOR_476486]. Adherence to the protein packets 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_476519]. Objective measures of adherence are NAE and UNi.  
 
Medical history questionnaire  
The medical history includes medication and supplement use, general medical history, and past and current 
cigarette smoking and alcohol use. The questionnaire will be conducted in person or by [CONTACT_476520].    
 
Study interventions 
Whey protein powder. Protein 
packets will contain 15-25g of 
whey protein each. We will 
advance all participants to 
approximately 1.5 g/kg/d based on their body weight and typi[INVESTIGATOR_476487]. The whey protein and 
its isocaloric placebo (maltodextrin - an easily digestible flavorless starch) powder will be flavorless and 
purchased in bulk at http://www.bulkfoods.com. The dietary team will make the packets and distribute to 
participants at baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 18. The packets will be mixed with water and the dietary team also 
will provide a menu for how to incorporate the powder into recipes. The whey and placebo powder packets will 
be isocaloric. 
 
KHCO 3 supplement. The 81 mmol of KHCO 3 is available in six 13.5 mmol capsules daily; an equal volume of 
microcrystalline cellulose (placebo) will be placed in 6 identical gelatin capsules. All capsules will be taken with 
8-oz of water or the supplement drink immediately after meals. On days 1-14, participants will take 1 capsule 
after each meal (adaptation period to minimize risk of GI intolerance); thereafter, they will take 2 capsules after 
each meal (6/d). KHCO 3 capsules and matching placebo capsules will be purchased from Life Enhancement 
Products, Inc. (Reno, NV). Independent analysis by [CONTACT_411522] (Madison, WI) will be carried out to verify contents. 
 
Dietary intake assessment   
Dietary telephone prescreening questionnaire  – Usual protein intake in grams per day will be assessed with a 
two-item questionnaire developed in the NEPS laboratory to target individuals on no more than 0.8 g/kg/day of 
dietary protein. Each of the two questions has multiple parts. For example, participant responses to the following 
question: “How many servings of per day do you have of a) meat, poultry, and fish? b) eggs? c) dairy such as 
milk, yogurt and cheese?”  For part a), think of a serving as being about the size of a deck of cards. For part c), 
think of a serving as a cup of milk or yogurt or 2 slices of cheese. The second question asks about vegetable 
and other non-animal protein foods. From servings, the questionnaire calculates g/d of dietary protein which we 
can then arrive at the g/kg/d with a body weight. This daily intake will be reviewed and confirmed at screening 
with an in-person dietary assessment.

Version 11-4-2022  3-day dietary records-assisted recall  – Three consecutive 24hr dietary recalls will be done for [ADDRESS_610988] recall day will coincide with the 24-hr urines collected for NAE, Ni, and Cr.  Both 
the recalls and urine collections will be done on “normal days” so as to be most representative of the participant’s 
normal diet pattern. Having 24-hr recalls on the day of the 24-hr urine collections will enable us to link specific 
foods to daily dietary protein intake and NAE. This diet information will also enable us to adjust our 24-hr UNi 
measurements for nitrogen intake, and thereby [CONTACT_476521] a surrogate for protein intake 
and muscle catabolism at end of study following unblinding . Recalls will also be conducted on weeks 6, 12, 18 
and Final Day 2 to track protein intake and NAE throughout the study. 24-hr recalls were used in NHANES, and 
this will allow us to compare intakes of our participants to national averages.  Subjects will be given detailed 
instructions and measuring aids (a measuring cup, spoons, a ruler and a Food Amounts Booklet) and asked to 
record everything they eat and drink. They will report what they have consumed to a trained diet technician each 
day. The 1st recall will highlight what level of food intake detail will be needed to report for the remaining recall 
days. The dietary interview training is adapted from the 24-hr recall protocol used by [CONTACT_476522], Minn, MN, http://www.ncc.umn.edu/index.html . It is recognized that having to write food items down may 
alter what participants choose to eat; however, this approach with frequent contact [CONTACT_476523], including diet records 
which do not involve daily staff interaction. The food lists will be coded and analyzed with use of the Minnesota 
database (NDSR software version 2018, developed by [CONTACT_88246], U. of Minn., Minn, MN). 
From this we will attain specific information on food group and nutrient intake, as well as protein nitrogen intake. 
 
Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans for lean tissue mass 
Lean tissue mass will be measured on total body DXA scans with a precision in our laboratory of 0.67%.65 It 
will be measured on a Hologic Horizon-A (Bedford, MA).  The scanner utilizes IRIS Enterprise-APEX for 
systems on APEX 4.xx which includes DICOM Storage, DICOM Modality Worklist, Remote Physician's Viewer 
Physician's Report, Writer HL7 Enterprise Data Management Installation. Participants will be scanned wearing 
light clothing and no shoes. All participants will be scanned at the same time of day at baseline and final day [ADDRESS_610989] a single 60 mg dose of stable D 3‐creatine on Day -3 enrollment and 
again on final day 1. The D 3-creatine is procured from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (catalog# DLM-
1302-MPT). D 3-Creatine is encapsulated by [CONTACT_476524] (Houston, TX) as a 60 mg 
dose in each capsule. To measure total body creatine pool size and muscle mass, the second void of 
fasting morning urine will be collected 3 days following the dose (baseline and final day 2 visits). A urine 
will also be collected on final day [ADDRESS_610990] any remaining D 3-creatinine from the baseline dose. The 
urine will be measured for D 3‐creatinine enrichment in the urine, which will be determined by [CONTACT_29864]-MS/MS 
at the University of [LOCATION_004] at Berkeley. To minimize variability in this muscle mass measurement, 
participants will be asked not to eat foods containing creatine or creatinine (animal products) after their 
mid-day meal on the day prior to these urine collections on day 0 (Baseline), day 164 (Final Day 1) and 
day 168 (Final Day 2). In a subset of participants coming in for a Week [ADDRESS_610991] a difference, then this difference would be an 
adjustment factor in our analysis.  A handout will be provided to guide participants in what they should and 
should not eat on these three occasions. 
 
Muscle Measures and Physical Activity 
Isokinetic Muscle Strength: Muscle strength will be assessed by [CONTACT_476525] (1-RM) testing using 
the Keiser double leg press. 1-RM is defined as the maximum load that can be lifted one time and one time only 
IRB# [ZIP_CODE] 
HNRCA Study # [ADDRESS_610992] proper form and lifting technique explained and demonstrated for them. Participants will be familiarized 
with the equipment and learning proper exercise and breathing technique. The participant will then perform five 
to eight repetitions at a resistance equal to 50% of their estimated 1-RM as an exercise-specific warm-up.  Each 
participant will then perform and additional 5-[ADDRESS_610993]. Fielding (Co-I).  
 
Leg power  - Peak power will be assessed by [CONTACT_476526]. Following baseline 1-RM 
measurement, 1-RM at 40% and 70% is established. The participant performs 5 lifts at each established % as 
fast as possible through their full range of motion. The highest power output achieved at each % is determined 
to be the peak power. Reliability of this measurement in older subjects in our lab is excellent (ICC = 0.901).[ADDRESS_610994]. Fielding (Co-I). 
 
Isokinetic Muscle Endurance of Knee Extensor -Muscle endurance of knee extensors will be assessed using a 
standard protocol on a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer which consists of a lever arm that can be attached to a 
part of the body and moved through a range of motion. After a period of warm-up and familiarization, subjects 
are encouraged to exert maximal force for 5 repetitions with the speed of rotation set at 60°/sec.  After a 2-min 
rest, subjects will perform 60 maximal contractions at 240°/sec.  The peak torque and its corresponding angle 
will be recorded as the maximal effort. The right and left side will initially be measured separately and in a random 
order, and the highest result taken as their actual peak torque. We have previously shown that two tests are 
necessary to achieve maximal results due to learning effect.70 Pearson's correlation coefficients (P < 0.01) 
between peak torque of the knee and muscle mass ranged from 0.[ADDRESS_610995]. Roger Fielding (Co-I). 
 
Handgrip strength  - Handgrip strength is a convenient, safe, and reliable measure of overall muscle strength. 
Handgrip strength of both hands will be determined separately using a hand held dynamometer.  The highest of 
three consecutive readings will be recorded as the maximum force produced with each hand.  Up to 20 seconds 
will be allowed between measurements. This will be captured at baseline and final day 2 visits. 
 
Modified SPPB (HABC-PPB)  - The short physical performance battery (SPPB) is a performance-based measure 
of lower-extremity function developed by [CONTACT_6059].71 It is highly predictive of subsequent disability; however, in 
well-functioning older adults, the SPPB may not adequately discriminate physical performance.72 To broaden 
the applicability, Health ABC investigators expanded the SPPB by [CONTACT_175548] (to 
30 seconds), adding a single foot stand, and adding a 6-meter narrow walk test of balance.  They also adapted 
the scoring method to reduce the ceiling effects that are common in well-functioning groups.72 The Health ABC 
Physical Performance Battery (HABC-PPB) has been used to assess lower extremity function in Health ABC, a 
population-based study designed to identify determinants of functional decline in well-functioning older adults 
because it discriminates over a broad range of lower extremity function.[ADDRESS_610996] the option of returning on a separate day to repeat measurements. Participants will be compensated for 
travel with an extra $25 for the additional visit. 
 
IRB# [ZIP_CODE] 
HNRCA Study # [ADDRESS_610997] and between 7 and 9:30 am.  All samples from individual 
participants will be batched for analyses. Serum K, HCO 3-, serum chemistries, Cr and urinary Cr will be measured 
on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer (Olympus AU400, Olympus America Inc, Melville, NY). Estimated 
GFR will be assessed from serum Cr with use of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study 
equation (see Exclusion Criteria in the  Protection of Human Subjects ). Serum 25OHD levels will be measured 
by [CONTACT_29864]/MS/MS on a Waters Acquity UPLC with TQD triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a coefficient of 
variation (CV) of 6%. Separation is on a C18 UPLC column. NIST 25OHD standards are run to calibrate the 
assay. Serum IGF-1 will be measured by [CONTACT_476527] (IMMULITE® 1000, Diagnostic Product Corporation, Los Angeles, CA). The CV ranges 
from 3.0 to 9.0%. Urinary nitrogen will be measured with a model FP-2000 nitrogen/protein determinator (LECO, 
St. Joseph, MI) with intra- and inter-assay CVs of 6.5% and 8.6%. Urinary NAE (=titratable acid + NH 4+ - HCO 3) 
will be measured by a modification of the Jorgensen titration method 76, as described by [CONTACT_37054],77 with precision 
in our laboratory of 10.1%.78 
 
ETHICS AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics and Design 
This proposal involves the participation of human volunteers in a 2x2 factorial design, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled study. Participants take an added whey protein packet to achieve a 1.5 g/kg/d protein intake 
or isocaloric placebo daily with meals and either a KHCO 3 81 mmol/d supplement or a matching placebo daily 
over a 24-wk period to assess changes in lower extremity muscle power, endurance, handgrip, physical 
performance, lean and muscle mass, and 24-h UNi excretion. Participants agree to attend up to 9 intrastudy 
visits (Screening, Enrollment, Baseline, week 1 if on certain medications ONLY, week 6, week 12, week 18, Final 
Day 1 and 2). These visits will involve (1) a blood draw (Baseline, week 1, week 6, and Final Day 2), (2) return 
of a 24h urine collection (Baseline  and Final Day 2), (3) second fasting urine sample (Baseline and Final Day 1 
and 2), (4) double leg press power testing, knee extensor strength testing (Baseline  week 12, and Final Day 2), 
(5) diet recall interviews in person (Baseline, week 6, week 12, week 18, and Final Day 2), (6) hand grip, modified 
SPPB test, and whole body DXA scan for body composition analysis (Baseline and Final Day 2), and (7) physical 
activity and medical history questionnaires (Baseline and Final Day 2). Up to 300 men and women age 65 years 
and over will be screened to attain 120 completers. Participants will be generally healthy and will continue their 
usual diet and activity level. We will include participants on ≤0.8 g/kg/d of dietary protein and are underactive. 
The study will be conducted at the Jean Mayer USDA HNRCA at Tufts University. 
 
Sources of Materials 
At the screening visit, records will be made of the response to screening questionnaires, medical history and 
physical examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory results. Daily dietary protein at baseline will be 
confirmed. Daily physical activity will be assessed. During the course of the study, additional data in the form of 
records from visits, responses to questionnaires, and testing procedures will be obtained.  
 
In addition to the testing performed during the study, blood and urine specimens will be archived for future 
measurements. All blood and tissue samples will be used for the purpose of this study only and will be discarded 
once all study-related analyses are complete. All laboratory tests that will be performed in the Nutrition Evaluation 
Laboratory at the HNRCA are in compliance with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 . 
Participants will be issued an individually identifiable number linking records, specimens and data. The 
participants’ private information will be kept confidential, and access to this information will be restricted to the 
investigators only. 
 
Informed Consent 
- Informed consent for both the screening and study will be obtained from each participant by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_476488]. It will be obtained at the beginning of the screening 
and enrollment visits. The consenting process will take place in a private area. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_476489]# [ZIP_CODE] 
HNRCA Study # 3010 
17 
Version 11-4-2022  registered nurses on the research team will go over the study information and will obtain the participants’ 
consent. The full nature of the study (purpose, procedures, risk) will be provided to participants. 
Participants will be encouraged to ask questions and will be told that they can cease participating in the 
study at any time for any reason. Participants’ consent will be documented in written form, signed by [CONTACT_476528] [INVESTIGATOR_85374]. The study protocol and consent form will have been approved 
by [CONTACT_476529] (IRB). All personnel coming in contact [CONTACT_476530]. Subjects must be able to read 
and, in the view of study staff, indicate understanding of the study purpose and procedures to be eligible.  
- Reasons for not enrolling non-English and illiterate participants are:  
o This study involves a large number of assessment tools, surveys, questionnaires and adherence 
calendars that are only available in English and in written form and there are no oral/video 
alternatives. 
o Translators are not readily available at the HNRCA. 
o This is an early phase clinical study without a prospect for direct benefit and it will provide 
preliminary results for a larger longer-term clinical study. 
 
Protections Against Risk 
To optimize intra-study safety and tolerability, we will take the following steps:  
- We will strictly adhere to protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
- Blood sampling will be done by [CONTACT_175572]. They will use aseptic 
techniques. 
- DXA scans will be performed by [CONTACT_476531].  
- We will exclude subjects with eGFR < 50 ml/min and serum potassium levels above the normal range.  
- The muscle performance measurements will be administered by [CONTACT_476532].  
- We will instruct participants to notify [CONTACT_109194] of any changes in health status or of any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_476490].  
- We will have participants who are unable to tolerate all the study pi[INVESTIGATOR_476491].  
 
The study will be approved by [CONTACT_476529] (IRB) before anyone will be recruited for the 
study. All study personnel have been certified by [CONTACT_476533]. All research activity will take place at the Jean Mayer USDA HNRCA with the exception of the 
statistical analyses which will in part be conducted across the street at the Tufts CTSI Statistical Department. 
Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. To ensure confidentiality of participant 
information, personal information will not be given to anyone unless the law requires it. The Tufts Medical Center 
IRB or the NIH appointed Safety Monitor, [CONTACT_476546], may check records that identify specific participants.  
This might include medical records from this study and the informed consent forms.  The records of this study 
might also be reviewed by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH) to make sure all rules and guidelines were 
followed. Participant information will be kept in a locked medical records room at the HNRCA.  The computer 
files contain identification numbers but not personal identifiers of participants.  
 
Protection of study blinding 
Discontinuation of study medications will be managed without unblinding. Participants will be encouraged to 
remain in the study and complete measurements per protocol to be included in the intention-to-treat analysis.  
One exception to this is if a participant develops a “serious” Adverse Event in which case he/she will not be 
asked to remain in the study. If there is an Adverse Event which is thought by [CONTACT_476534] “probably related” 
or “related” to the coded medication, the PI, when necessary for the safety of the participant, will contact [CONTACT_476535], and ask him to provide the treatment assignment to the participant’s 
physician. A detailed written report will be submitted to the IRB.

Version 11-4-2022  Data Safety and Monitoring Plan 
 
To optimize intra-study safety and tolerability, we will take the following steps: 
 upon enrollment, give each participant a wallet card containing name, dates in study, study treatments 
(whey protein or isocaloric placebo powder per day; 81 mmol KHCO 3 or matching placebo per day) and 
contact [CONTACT_476536] ([CONTACT_109194], PI) can be reached during the day and 
evening/weekend hours;  
 
 instruct participants to notify [CONTACT_109194] before  starting any new drugs during this study (because some 
medications impair potassium excretion and increase risk of hyperkalemia); 
 
 instruct participants to notify [CONTACT_109194] of any changes in health status or of any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_476492]; 
 
 monitor serum potassium (K) at baseline, 6 wks on full 81 mmol/d dose and at the end of study at 24 
wks. In addition, we will measure serum K at 1 week if the participant is on an ACEI, ARB or potassium 
sparing diuretic. We will measure serum K at any other time, should a participant experience an AE which 
might be related to the trial. In the unlikely event that it is elevated,  the measurement will be repeated 
immediately. If the repeat measure is elevated, all study pi[INVESTIGATOR_476493]. Serum K will be re-
measured after one day off of the study pi[INVESTIGATOR_476494]. If it remains elevated, 
the participant will be referred immediately to his/her doctor. Discontinuation of study medications will be 
managed without unblinding. Participants will be encouraged to remain in the study and complete 
measurements per protocol to be included in the intention to treat analysis.  One exception to this is if a 
participant develops a “serious” AE in which case he/she will not be asked to remain in the study. If there 
is an AE which is thought by [CONTACT_476534] “probably related” or “related” to the coded medication, the 
PI, when necessary for the safety of the participant, will contact [CONTACT_476537], the unblinded team 
member, and ask her to provide the treatment assignment to the participant’s physician. A detailed written 
report will be submitted to the IRB. 
 
 monitor GFR after 6 wks in the study and at the final 24-wk visit. GFR will be monitored because the 
higher protein intake and progressive renal failure increases risk of hyperkalemia. The study inclusion 
criteria include a GFR ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73m2. If GFR falls below 45 ml/min/1.73 m2, participants will be 
asked to return for a repeat measurement the following day.  Should the participant be unable or unwilling 
to return for the repeat study blood, study interventions (powder packets and pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) will be discontinued.  
Participants who fail to show up for repeat monitoring will be contact[CONTACT_476538]. If the repeat measure is normal, the participant continues per protocol.  If the repeat 
GFR is below 45 ml/min/1.73 m2, the study powder and pi[INVESTIGATOR_476495]/her physician for follow-up care.  If the repeat GFR is in the range of 45-50 ml/min/1.73m2, the 
participant will remain on study capsules and be asked to return for a follow-up GFR measurement in the 
next week.  If the GFR is again less than 45 ml/min/1.73, the participant will stop study capsules and be 
referred to his care giver for follow-up.  If it is above 45 ml/min/1.73, the participant will continue taking 
study pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].  Participants discontinuing study capsules will remain in the study for the intent-to-treat 
analysis. The threshold of 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 was chosen to allow for some day to day fluctuation in 
creatinine and hydration status. Any decline below 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 will be recorded as an Adverse 
Event. 
 
 have all pi[INVESTIGATOR_476496] a full (8-oz) glass of water to increase 
tolerability; 
 
 have all powder packet supplements incorporated in each meal in split doses to increase tolerability; 
 
 phase-in treatment for study pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (taking half dose for the first 14 days) to increase tolerability

Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
To help ensure safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data, a DSMB was established to monitor 
this trial. This was done in accordance with NIH policy. This board have reviewed and approved the plans and 
safety and overall operations and have approved the Manual of Operating Procedures before the trial begins. 
The members of the DSMB were chosen by [CONTACT_476539]. This board includes two experts in the field of dietary protein and acid-base and a statistician. 
Names of candidates have been provided by [CONTACT_6059]. In addition, the Program Officer, Giovanna Zappala PhD, 
from the NIA who is responsible for this trial is included. DSMB members have no conflicts of interest related to 
the trial. Administrative and safety summaries will be sent to the DSMB at the requested intervals during the trial. 
These reports will describe the numbers of participants screened, enrolled, and completed, and summaries of 
the baseline characteristics of the enrollees and of adverse events.  
 
Adverse event (AE) reporting 
 All AEs (“expected or “unexpected”) and/or laboratory abnormalities and/or problems will be recorded on 
AE forms and include a brief narrative description including onset, duration, whether the AE has resolved, 
whether it was expected or unexpected, and whether any treatment was administered for the AE.  
 Severity of AEs will be described (“serious” or “non-serious”). Serious AEs, whether or not related to the 
trial, will be reported to IRB and DSMB immediately (within 24 hours) by [CONTACT_476540]. Other AEs 
will be reported within 5 days to the IRB and at the requested interval to the DSMB. 
 
Other IRB reports 
 All serious AEs and any AE that results in the participant’s withdrawal from the study or deviation from 
the study protocol.  
 New information that may adversely affect safety of participants or conduct of trial.  
 If applicable, recent literature relevant to the hypothesis related to the trial to determine whether 
continuation of the trial is ethical in the setting of new information. 
 All proposed protocol modifications or additions. 
 Annual continuing review, listing study progress and all AEs. 
 
Unanticipated problem and adverse event (AE) reporting  
This will be done in accordance with the Tufts IRB Reportable New Information policy.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
See Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Importance of Knowledge to be Gained 
 
Importance of the knowledge: The goal of this study is to identify a dietary intervention that is acceptable over 
the long term to healthy adults and that will lower NAE and potentially improve body composition, lower body 
weight, and improve bone and muscle mass and function in adults. If effective, the proposed dried fruit regimen 
would have significant clinical benefit in lowering the chronic disease burden of adults.  
 
Risk/Importance Assessment: There is minimal risk to participants and no direct benefit from the proposed 
research study. The potential for serious adverse events is small and the potential benefit to society is high 
enough to justify conducting this study. 
 
Study sponsorship 
This study is funded by [CONTACT_18121]/NIA.

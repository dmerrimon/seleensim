6 2 INTRODUCTION 
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a common and debilitating disease that also affects the skin.1,2 
Between 30% and 70% of patients with DM, both type 1 and type 2, will present with a 
cutaneous complication of DM. Dermatologic conditions linked with DM vary in severity and can be benign, deforming, and even life-threatening.
1These skin conditions can offer insight 
into patients’ glycemic control and may be the first sign of DM in undiagnosed patients. Recognition and management of these conditions is important in maximizing the quality of life and in avoiding serious adverse effects.  DM can be associated with pruritus, more often localized than generalized. Affected areas can include the scalp, ankles, feet, trunk, or genitalia. Pruritus is more likely in DM who have dry skin or diabetic neuropathy. Cutaneous disorders associated with DM commonly bother and cause pain and severely impact quality of life, including interpersonal relationships.

subjects reporting adverse events (AEs) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_387300](s). 
 Efficacy analyses will be perform ed on the ITT and PP populations, with ITT as the primary 
population and PP supportive.   4.[ADDRESS_485199] is considered to be enrolled in the study when he/she has provided written informed

4.14.3 Definition s of Terms  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence ass ociated with the use of an 
investigational product in humans, whether or not considered product- related  as per ICH E2D . 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a product, without any judgment about causality. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is defined as any AE for which there is reasonable 
possibility that the product caused the AE (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if it is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the labeling for the study products.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any AE or SAR that, in the view of the investigator or Sponsor, results in 
any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32 (a)): 
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Required intervention to prevent permanent i mpairment/damage

Protocol   24JULY2020  
 
15 [IP_ADDRESS] Mandatory problem reporting  
All AEs must be documented in the CRFs and source documents. The qualified investigator is 
required to report serious adverse events to the study Sponsor within 72 hours of discovery.   4.14.4 Assessment of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity  
Severity of AEs will be graded according to the following definitions: 
Mild :
 AE that was easily tole rated  
Moderate: AE sufficiently discomforting t o interfere with daily activity  
Severe: AE that prevented normal daily activities  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Causality  
A medically  qualified investigator must assess the relationship of any AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of the study product as unlikely related, possibly related, or probably related based on available information, using the following guidelines:  
Unlikely related :
  no temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified, 
or the study product cannot be implicated  based on available information 
Possibly related : te mporal association but other etiologies are likely to be the cause; 
however, involvement of the study product cannot be excluded based on available information  
Probably related : t
 emporal association, other etiologies are possible, but unlikely based 
on available information.

 Reporting Safety Observations 
Any S/ AE must be reported to the Sponsor or designee by [CONTACT_756], email  or through the study

DID YOU KNOW ? 
 
The skin naturally contains 
ceramides that become 
depleted over time, leading to 
dry and irritated skin.  
  
WHAT ARE CERAMIDES?  
 
Part of the glue that holds skin cells 
together, ceramides help skin keep 
moisture in and irritants out, while 
maintaining the skin’s barrier.  
To replenish the vital ceramides healthy 
skin needs, CeraVe products are 
formulated with ceramides 1, 3 & 6- II. 
HOW DOES IT WORK?  
 
CeraVe products use patented 
Multivesicular Emulsion (MVE) 
technology that releases ingredients 
slowly over time, allowing them to 
absorb into the skin to hydrate & nourish, 
as well as restore & maintain the skin’s 
natural barrier.  
Hyaluronic Acid  
Helps retain skin’s natural moisture  
MVE Delivery Technology  
Controlled release for all day hydration

RVL -[ADDRESS_485996].RVL-1201.RVL-1201-203.PR.A02  14 4. INTRODUCTION  
RevitaLid Inc. (RevitaLid) is pursuing the development of RVL-1201 Ophthalmic Solution 
(oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, 0.1%) for the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis (ptosis). Ptosis is experienced by [CONTACT_3450] 12% of adults over the age of 50 (Sridharan et  al, 1995). It is a unilateral or bilateral abnormal droopi[INVESTIGATOR_31420] a partial or complete dysfunction of the muscle(s) that elevate the upper eyelid: the levator palpebrae superioris and/or Müller’s muscle. Patients with ptosis may experience significa nt superior visual field defects, which can affect daily activities such as 
driving, crossing streets, and reading. 
Treatment for acquired ptosis usually involves surgery, with risks of infection, bleeding, over- or 
undercorrection, reduced vision, and lagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids completely) (Finsterer, 2003). Mechanical treatment of ptosis (scleral contact [CONTACT_31447] a bar to lift the eyelid ( Shah -Desai  et al, 2010), eyelid ptosis crutches attached to glasses, or adhesive tape or 
putty to affix the upper eyelid to the supraorbital structures) is limited by [CONTACT_31448], contact [CONTACT_31449], or skin irritation. Pharmacologic treatment of ptosis has not been pursued because the agents that have been eval uated (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], dipi[INVESTIGATOR_31421], 
apraclonidine, phenylephrine, brimonidine) either caused mydriasis, resulting in blurred vision or photophobia, or unacceptable systemic side effects (Matjucha,  2011; Scheinfeld, 2005; 
Kass et  al, 1979;  Fraunfelder and Scafidi,  1978).  
Oxymetazoline is a direct -acting α
2-adrenergic agonist that has been used at a 0.025% 
concentration as an ocular vasoconstrictor for nearly 30 years and at a 0.05% concentration as a nasal decongestant for almost 50 years. When administered at a 0.1% concentration it stimulates the α
2 adrenergic receptors in Müller’s muscle causing it to contract, thereby [CONTACT_31450], and retracting the lower eyelid to a lesser degree. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_387746] (0.01%, 0.025%) results in vasoconstriction and reduction of hyperemia but does not have the pharmacologic effect of raising the upper eyelid. 
RVL -1201 Ophthalmic Solution contains oxymetazoline hydrochloride 0.1% as the active 
ingredient, and it is provided in preservative-free unit-dose vials. Oxymetazoline hydrochloride , a well -characterized and selective α
2-adrenergic agonist, was first 
approved as the active ingredient in the vasoconstrictor/decongestant nasal spray, Afrin® 
(oxymetazoline hydrochloride, 0.05%) in 1966.  
Detailed information on the nonclinical and clinical studies performed with RVL-1201 may be 
found in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
4.1. Justification of Route, Dose, Regimen, and Treatment Period 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_31423] (0.01%, 0.025%) results in vasoconstriction and reduction of hyperemia but does not have the pharmacologic effect of improving the superior visual field or increasing the marginal reflex distance (MRD). This effect is present at a concentration of 0.1%, the concentration of 
RVL -1201, based on the results of the Phase 3 study, Study RVL -1201-201. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 
Study RVL -1201-001, showed that RVL -1201 administered  once daily (QD) and twice daily 
RVL -[ADDRESS_485997].RVL-1201.RVL-1201-203.PR.A02  15 (BID) was more effective at elevating the upper eyelid than Vehicle, but BID dosing did not 
result in increased upper eyelid elevation compared to QD dosing. The safety profile of RVL -[ADDRESS_485998] Phase 3 study. The current Pha se 3 study, Study RVL -1201-203 will evaluate the safety 
of 1 drop of RVL -1201 Ophthalmic Solution in each eye QD for 84 days. This dosing duration 
was chosen to evaluate the safety of longer-term dosing than the 42-day period evaluated in 
Study RVL -1201-201. 
4.2. Good Clinical Practice Statement  
This study will be conducted according to all stipulations of the protocol including all statements regarding confidentiality and in compliance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and all applicable [LOCATION_002] ( U.S.) federal regulations and local legal and 
regulatory requirements. 
4.3. Population to Be Studied 
Study subjects will be male or female subjects ≥ 9 years of age  with acquired blepharoptosis. See 
Section 7 for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Written informed consent will be obtained prior to enrollment in the trial; for minor subjects, written informed consent from the parent/guardian and assent from the subject will be obtained following IRB guidelines. 
RVL -[ADDRESS_485999].RVL-1201.RVL-1201-203.PR.A02  17 6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
6.1. Overall Study Design 
This will be a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the extended safety of RVL-1201 Ophthalmic Solution compared to Vehicle (placebo) 
for the treatment of acquired ptosis. The study will be conducted over 84 days (12 weeks) .  
Eligible  subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the following 2 treatment arms and 
treated for 84 days: 
• RVL -1201 Ophthalmic Solution 1 drop in each eye QD in the morning (N = 150) 
• Vehicle (placebo) 1 drop in each  eye QD in the morning (N = 75) 
Both eyes will be treated and assessed .  
Following screening evaluations at the Screening/Baseline visit (Day 1), a determination of 
eligibility will be made, and eligible subjects will be randomized and receive study medication.  
Study medication, RVL-1201 or Vehicle (placebo), will be provided in identical-appearing 
unit-dose vials. The identity of the study medications will be masked to the subject, Investigator, study personnel responsible for ophthalmic evaluations, and Sponsor personnel.  
Subjects (or their caregiver, if necessary) will administer study medication QD in the morning 
during the study period. 
Safety follow-up visits will be conducted at Day 14 (Visit 2), Day 42 (Visit 3), and Day 84 
(Visit  4).

The following are the criteria for considering withdrawal from the study: 
• Withdrawal of subject consent/assent. The subject may request for any reason at any time to be withdrawn from the study. 
• The Sponsor terminates the study (see Sec tion 6.3). 
If a subject withdraws from the study, the principal reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
If a study subject fails to attend a study visit at any point during the study period, every effort 
should be made to keep the subject in the study and conduct all study visits as scheduled; all attempts to contact [CONTACT_45316]. If the subject relocates during the study period, Oculos Clinical Research (Oculos), the clinical research organization, should be contact[CONTACT_31452] a possibility that the subject could continue at another clinical site.  
RVL -[ADDRESS_486010] S 
8.1. Description of Study Medications  
RVL -1201 and Vehicle (placebo) are formulated for topi[INVESTIGATOR_31429], sterile, non-preserved ophthalmic solutions and contain 0.1% or 0% of the active 
ingredient, oxymetazoline hydrochloride, respectively. Both RVL-1201 and V ehicle will be 
packaged in identical unit-dose vials to  maintain masking of treatment identity . 
8.2. Randomization and Masking 
Study medication will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (RVL-1201 Ophthalmic Solution [N = 150]; Vehicle [placebo] [N = 75]). A randomized block design will be used, and the randomization 
will be created by a biostatistician  independent of the trial. The randomization schedule will not 
be stratified by [CONTACT_31453]. 
If subjects meet eligibility criteria (see S ection  7) at Screening/Baseline, Day 1  (Visit 1), sites 
will access the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) to randomize subjects to study 
treatm ent and assign the study medication kit to be dispensed. The drug kit and randomization 
numbers will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. Study medication from the IWRS-assigned kit 
will be dispensed to the subject after initial dosing at the study site on Day 1 (Visit 1), on 
Day 14 ± 3 (Visit 2) and on Day 42 ± 3 (Visit 3). 
The study will be double masked. The study medication will be provided in identical-appearing 
pouches with no labeling indicating the identity of the study group or the contents of the unit-dose vials. The pouches will contain identical-appearing unit-dose vials (see Section  8.1). 
Study subjects, Investigators and staff, and study management personnel will be masked to the identity of treatment until after the final database lock. 
8.2.1. Unmasking During the Study Period 
Should it be necessary to unmask a subject’s treatment assignment in case of emergency, the 
Investigator may obtain the treatment code for a given randomized subject from the IWRS . The 
treatment  code is to be obtained only if a medical emergency exists and knowledge of the 
medication being taken will influence the medical management of the subject.  
The following procedure should be followed: 
1. The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_387753] a subject unless it is not possible to do so without risk to the subject. 
2. The Investigator should document the AE and justification for unmasking in the Study 
Summary and Comments pages of the eCRF.  
3. If the subject is to be discontinued from study medication , then ALL procedures 
described in the Early Discontinuation Visit ( Section  10.4) should be completed. 
4. The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_31455] -[EMAIL_7493] within [ADDRESS_486011]’s welfare that will not interfere with the evaluation 
of the study medication may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. If there is any question as to whether the medication may interfere, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_279590]. Whenever possible, medications should be administered in dosages that remain constant throughout the study duration. Note: Contact [CONTACT_31457]. Contact [CONTACT_31458] [ADDRESS_486012] should continue with study medication . 
Prohibited medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_31430]:  
• Periocular neurotoxin (e.g., Botox, Xeomin, Dysport, Myobloc) injections within 
3 months prior to Visit 1 and during the study. 
• MAOIs ( e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine) within 14 days prior to 
Visit  1 and during the study. 
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_31431] (i.e., Latisse
®) to the eyelashes within 7 days prior 
to Visit 1 and during the study. 
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_20718] (including anti-allergy [ e.g., antihistamines], dry eye 
[i.e., Restasis®, Xiidra®], antimicrobial drugs [e.g., antibiotics and antivirals], and 
anti-inflammatory drugs [including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
and steroids] other than the assigned study medication within 7 days prior to Visit 1 and during the study. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_387747]. All other topi[INVESTIGATOR_31417]. 
• Intravi treal injections ( e.g., Lucentis

• OTC vasoconstrictor/decongestant eye medication (e.g., Visine® L.R.®) or any 
ophthalmic or non-ophthalmic α-adrenergic agonist including OTC products (e.g., Afrin
®); at any time during the study, artificial tears are allowed.  
RVL -[ADDRESS_486013] that will be calculated by [CONTACT_29963] (eD C) system. 
8.5. Discontinuation of Study Medication 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the subject will be withdrawn from study medication and followed through the conclusion of the pregnancy (Section  9.6). 
Subjects may be discontinued from study medication because of  either  of the following:  
• Adverse event: A clinically significant or serious AE  that in the Investigator’s or 
Medical Monitor ’s judgment, suggests that  continued administration of study 
medication  is not in the subject’s best interests for safety reasons. Additionally, if an 
AE requires treatment, the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor may determine that study medication should not be concurrently administered with a required concomitant medication. 
• Subject request: Subject requests to be withdrawn from study medication. 
When possible, a decision to discontinue a subject from study medication should first be discu ssed with the Medical Monitor. If a subject is discontinued from study medication, every 
effort should be made to encourage the subject to continue to attend study visits to be followed for safety, rather than withdrawing the subject from the study or, failing that, to perform all early discontinuation assessment procedures at the visit the subject is withdrawn ( Section  10.4). 
Reasons for considering subject withdrawal from the study are discussed in Section  7.3.  
8.6. Study Medication Materials and Management  
8.6.1. Packaging and Labeling 
Study medication will be packaged and labeled at a central packaging facility. Study sites will 
utilize the I WRS to assign kits to subjects.  
8.6.2. Storage and Administration 
Study medication must be stored at room temperature 15°-25° C (59°-77° F). A room tempe rature log will be maintained at each study site. Subjects should be instructed not to store 
or place the study medication where it can be exposed to extreme temperatures (e.g., refrigeration or leaving it in a hot car) or light . The study medication will be provided in a 
child -resistant package. Importantly, subjects MUST store the eye drops out of reach of children 
at all times. Accidental ingestion by [CONTACT_31459]. If a child accidentally swallows these eye drops, call the National Capi[INVESTIGATOR_31434] ([PHONE_2744]) and seek emergency medical care immediately.  
Site personnel will instruct the subject on the proper instillation technique at Day 1 (Visit 1) and 
the subject (or caregiver, if the subject is not able to self -administer the medication) will 
administer the first dose at the study site, instilling [ADDRESS_486014].RVL-1201.RVL-1201-203.PR.A02  27 (Note: if a full drop is not instilled into the eye, the subject should wait approximately 
10-15 seconds and administer a second drop). The subject should be in a seated position and should tilt his or her head backward for administration of the study medication. The vial of study medication should be held at an almost vertical position above the eye while the lower eyelid is pulled down gently, and [ADDRESS_486015] it in the box for return to the study site. On  Day 14 ± 3 days (Visit  2), s ubjects will 
return all opened and unopened study medication materials (the box, pouches, and unit-dose vials) , and site personnel will conduct study medication accountability procedures and dispense 
study medication for the next study period. On  Day 42 ± 3 days (Visit 3) all  study medication 
materials will be returned to the study site, study medication accountability will be conducted, 
and study medication for the remaining study period will be dispensed. Lastly, on Day 84 ± 3 days (Visit 4) all study medication materials will be returned to the study site and final study 
medication  accountability will be conducted. The Day [ADDRESS_486016] day of study 
treatment; no further study medication will be dispensed at this visit. 
Note: Contact [CONTACT_31457]. Contact [CONTACT_31460] [ADDRESS_486017]’s 
kit will contain sufficient study medication for the duration of the trial. Final study medication accountability will be conducted at Day 84 ± 3 days (Visit 4); study medication will not be 
re-dispensed at this visit . The Investigator or clinical site staff will account for all received and 
returned study medication. The monitor will review dispensing and study medication accountability records during site visits and at the completion of the study and note any discrepancies. All investigational study medication must be stored in a secure facility with access limited to the Investigator and authorized staff.  
RVL -[ADDRESS_486018]’s parent or legal guardian must provide permission by [CONTACT_31470], and assent from the minor subject should also be obtained following IRB guidelines . If a subject becomes [ADDRESS_486019] be performed in the order specified in Table  2. 
9.1. Demographic and Background Characteristics  
9.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
A complete medical history will be obtained from each subject. Demographic information including date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, iris color, and date of informed consent will be recorded. 
9.1.2. Conco mitant Medications History 
All concomitant medications (prescription and OTC) taken at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline, 
Day 1) and for [ADDRESS_486020] dose, site of dosing (e.g., right eye, left eye, both eyes [OU] , systemic), and the reason the 
concomitant medication is being taken must be recorded in the eCRF. When a concomitant 
medication has been taken at a stable dose for longer than [ADDRESS_486021] will be performed for females  of childbearing potential only (females 
who have started their menstrual cycles). 
9.2. External Photography 
An external photograph of the subject’s face will be taken using the provided digita l camera. It is 
crucial that the same level of ambient lighting be maintained for each photograph throughout the 
study. The subject will be required to remove mascara and any other eyelid makeup if applicable. The subject will also  be asked to relax his/her facial muscles. The photograph will frame the 
subject’s face from mid-forehead to the tip of the nose vertically and from ear-to -ear 
horizontally. A standardized millimeter ruler label will be placed vertically on the forehead, centered above the eyebrow s, as a measurement legend. Measurements (MRD and pupil 
RVL -[ADDRESS_486022].RVL-1201.RVL-1201-203.PR.A02  29 diameter ) will be made from the digital image or color printed copy of the photograph using a 
handheld caliper and the millimeter ruler label as the legend. 
9.2.1. Marginal Reflex Distance Measurement  
The distance from the center pupi[INVESTIGATOR_31435]. The MRD will be measured from the external photograph. 
9.3. Safety Assessments  
Assessment of the safety and tolerability  of RVL-1201 Ophthalmic Solution compared to 
Vehicle will include bilateral ophthalmic examinations (Snellen  VA, pupil diameter 
measurement, SLE/CFS, intraocular pressure (IOP ) tonometry, dilated ophthalmoscopy/fundus 
exam), measurement of vital signs, and recording of adverse events. Subject rating of study 
medication tolerability  will also be obtained. 
9.3.1. Vital Signs 
Blood pressure (from the same arm, and with the same cuff size, appropriate for arm circumference, throughout study) and heart rate will be measured after at least [ADDRESS_486023]’s current corrective lens prescription, if applicable, at a distance equivalent to 
20 feet (6 meters). If the corrected or uncorrected visual acuity is 20/80 or better, no additional refraction is necessary. If corrected or uncorrected visual acuity is worse than 20/80, then an updated refraction must be performed. This refraction must be used for all VA and visual field (if applicable) assessments during the study. The subject must wear the same glasses (if applicable) at each visit. The updated refraction can be placed in a trial frame or phoropter for VA assessments, and the trial frame only for visual field (if applicable)  assessments. 
For subjects with surgical monovision correction, VA assessment may be conducted in the near vision eye with a  near vision reading card held at approximately [ADDRESS_486024]’s 
eye. 
9.3.3. Pupil Diameter Measurement  
Pupil diameter will be measured  (either horizontally or vertically if top of pupil is not visible in 
photograph) from the external photograph (see Section  9.2). 
9.3.4. Slit Lamp Exam/Corneal Fluorescein Staining  
A routine SLE will be performed to evaluate the anterior segment of the eye, including lids, cornea, conjunctiva, anterior chamber, iris, and lens. Abnormalities will be documented. 
Fluorescein staining of the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_31436]’s standard of care.  
RVL -[ADDRESS_486025].RVL-1201.RVL-1201-203.PR.A02  30 Staining will be graded on a 5-point scale: 
0 = No staining  
1 = Trace 
2 = Mild  
3 = Moderate 
4 = Severe 
9.3.5. Dilated Ophthalmoscopy/Fundus Exam  
Direct dilated ophthalmoscopy will include assessment of the optic nerve head for pallor and 
cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. A fundus exam consisting of the vitreous, optic nerve, macula, and peripheral retina will be conducted, and the structures will be graded as normal or abnormal. Only tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] (Mydriacyl) should be used for this exam. Phenylephrine hydrochloride (Neosynephrine) may NOT be used.   
9.3.6. Intraocular Pressure  Tonometry 
Intraocular pressure will be measured utilizing a Goldmann, Tono-Pen , or iCare tonometer 
(whichever is chosen, it must be used for the duration of the trial ; no combination is permitted) 
and using the standard of care. If possible, the same calibrated instrument should be used for a given subject throughout the study.  
9.3.7. Study Medication Tolerability  Assessment  
Subjects will be asked to rate the ocular tolerability of the medication according to the following 
4-point scale: 
0 = No discomfort 
1 = Mild discomfort  
2 = Moderate discomfort 3 = Severe discomfort 
9.4. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
9.4.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject administered a 
study medication (pharmaceutical/biological product) that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship to this medication. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. Study medication includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator product or vehicle placebo that is given during any phase of the study. 
RVL -[ADDRESS_486026].RVL-1201.RVL-1201-203.PR.A02  31 Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investigational treatment are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy. 
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_31463]-ended questioning of the subject at each visit 
during the study. At each clinic visit, study personnel should ask the following question: "Have you had any problems since your last visit?” AEs also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_31464]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, 
• Is life-threatening, 
Note: The term "life-threatening" refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (excluding progression/outcome of the disease under study); 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
• Is medically significant; i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the health of the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31437] a preplanned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of the study, is not considered an SAE. 
All SAEs that are ongoing at the time of completion or discontinuation from the study will be 
followed until stabilization or resolution of the event. 
9.5. Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of AEs to the study medication should be assessed by [CONTACT_31467]. 
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the study medication makes a causal 
relationship unlikely, or, other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide 
a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the study medication makes a causal 
relationship possible or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
RVL -[ADDRESS_486027] 
relationship between the study medication and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “suspected.” 
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined by [CONTACT_31466] “suspected” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporti ng. 
9.6. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], regardless of severity or potential association with the study medication or study procedures, will be recorded in the eCRF. Changes from baseline assessments that are part of the disease being studied will not necessarily be recorded as adverse events unless the Investigator deems them as such. Clinically significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate should be reported as AEs. All AEs that occur following consent and until the final study visit (Day 84, Visit 4) should be collected and recorded on the 
AE eCRF page. Serious adverse events will be followed until the event is resolved or stabilized.  
The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the following: 
• Onset (date and time); 
• Resolution (date and time); 
• Severity grade (mild, moderate, severe); 
• Relationship to study medication (not suspected, suspected); 
• Action taken (none, study medication temporarily interrupted, study medication 
permanently discontinued; concomitant medication taken; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; other); 
• Serious outcome (yes/no). 
The severity grade should be determined by [CONTACT_31467]. 
• Mild : Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  
• Moderate : Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal daily activity  
• Severe : Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity (as defined directly above) whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
An AE of severe intensity may not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form. Pregnancy in 
itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_49850] a contraceptive medication. The subject will be withdrawn from study medication and followed through conclusion of pregnancy. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented. 
RVL -[ADDRESS_486028].RVL-1201.RVL-1201-203.PR.A02  33 9.7. Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded following consent and until the final study 
visit, Day 84 (Visit 4), following the end of treatment exposure. Any SAEs “suspected” to be related to the investigational product and discovered by [CONTACT_7201].  
Any SAE that occurs must be reported to Oculos within [ADDRESS_486029] assess the SAE relationship and complete 
the SAE form. Oculos/RevitaLid Inc. may request additional information. Follow -up information 
(e.g., discharge summary) will be retained in the subject’s chart and a copy will be emailed to 
 
In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF page with the serious question marked “Yes”. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the approving IRB of any SAEs on a timely basis 
as instructed by [CONTACT_387754]’s determination of causality. 
All subjects who experience an SAE should be followed clinically and undergo the appropriate 
diagnostic evaluations until stabilization or resolution of the event. 
RevitaLid will report all SAEs to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the 
appropriate schedule depending if the event is drug related or not drug related, expected or 
unexpected (based on the available information in the Investigator’s Brochure ). 
Any death occurring during the study and follow up period should be reported as an SAE. For any death occurring through the end of the study, regardless of the degree of relationship to study medication , the SAE resulting in the death must be reported to Oculos. A death occurring after 
completion of the study does not require completion of the SAE form. 

RVL -[ADDRESS_486030].RVL-1201.RVL-1201-203.PR.A02  34 10. STUDY ACTIVITIES  
Table  2 provides a tabular summary of all scheduled visits and procedures to be performed 
during the clinical study. 
All ophthalmic assessments will be performed bilaterally. 
10.1. Day 1 (Visit 1): Screening /Baseline /Randomization/First Dose 
Subjects will provide written informed consent before any study-related screening procedures are 
conducted. For minor subjects, signed informed consent will be obtained from the subject’s parent or legal guardian, and assent will be obtained from the subject following IRB guidelines.  
Subjects will undergo screening/baseline evaluations to determine eligibility for the study. 
Following review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, the site will access the IWRS to randomize the subject to study treatment and assign the study medication kit to be dispensed.

To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, RevitaLid or its 
agent may conduct a quality assurance audit at any time during or after completion of a study. The Investigator will be given adequate notice if he/she is selected for an audit. The audit will 
include, but is not limited to: a review of all informed consent /assent  forms, medical records, and 
regulatory documentation; an assessment of study conduct and protocol compliance; and a review of the investigational drug product receipt, storage, and administration. At the conclusion of an audit, the auditor will conduct a brief meeting with the Investigator to review the findings of the audit. 
RVL -[ADDRESS_486041] (IRB) 
The IRB must review, approve, and provide continuing review of the clinical study protocol, 
protocol amendments, the informed consent documents, subject recruitment advertisements, and any other written information to be provided to the subjects. Initial IRB approval is an affirmative decision that the clinical study has been reviewed and may be conducted at the study site within the constraints set forth by [CONTACT_1201], the institution, GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. A copy of the IRB approval letter for the protocol, the informed consent, the intended advertising, and any written material to be provided to the subject must be submitted to Oculos prior to release of investigational supplies to the study site. Progress reports and notifications of serious adverse drug reactions will be provided to the IRB according to local regulations and guidelines. The IRB must be notified of completion or termination of the study. The study site must maintain an accurate and complete record of all reports, documents, and other submissions made to the IRB concerning this protocol. 
13.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted according to all stipulations of the protocol, including all statements regarding confidentiality, and in compliance with ICH guidelines, and all applicable US federal regulations and local legal and regulatory requirements. 
13.3. Written Informed Consent /Assent  
A sample ICF containing the required elements of informed consent will be provided by [CONTACT_31474]. 
Sample minor assent form(s) will be provided as required by [CONTACT_31475]. Any changes made to these sample s must be approved by [CONTACT_31476]. After approval by 
[CONTACT_31474], the informed consent form and minor assent form must be submitted to and approved by 
[CONTACT_1201]. The informed consent must be written in a language in which the subject is fluent. Regulations require that foreign language informed consent and assent forms be submitted to the IRB for approval. The foreign language translation is required to contain a statement of certification of the translation. The Investigator must forward a copy of the consent and assent forms, the certified foreign language translation, and an IRB approval letter to Oculos. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to inform each subject of the purpose of this clinical 
trial, including possible risks and benefits, and to document the informed consent process. Prior to undergoing any study-related procedures, the subject must read, sign, and date the current IRB-approved version of the informed consent form. For minor subjects, the assent form must be signed and dated per IRB guidelines. If subjects become [ADDRESS_486042] Confidentiality and Confidentiality of Data  
Data generated for the study should be stored in a limited-access file area and be accessible only to representatives of the study site, Oculos/RevitaLid Inc., the IRB, and FDA/relevant regulatory agencies. Me dical information resulting from a subject’s participation in this study may be given 
RVL -[ADDRESS_486043]’s personal physician or to the appropriate medical personnel responsible for the 
subject’s welfare. No information that can be related to a specific individual subject will be released or used in any fashion without the signed written consent of that subject. All reports and communications relating to study subjects will identify subjects only by [CONTACT_143295]. Complete subject identification will be kept by [CONTACT_387758]-term follow -up, if needed. This information will be treated with strict 
adherence to professional standards of confidentiality. 
13.5. Study Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_31479]. to assure compliance with the study protocol and the quality of the data collected. Monitoring visits may occur as required and could include a study initiation visit, interim monitoring visit s, and a study close-out visit. 
Training will be provided for key investigative personnel in all aspects of study conduct. The Investigator will be responsible for making sure that clinical site personnel are provided adequate training on conducting their designated tasks. 
The sites  will record data directly into the eCRF in order to optimize the eCRF source 
verification process with limited hand-written  source documentation. Monitors will review e-
source data and overall study data/consistency remotely and query discrepancies based upon 
eCRF entries (eCRF initial entry is the source). During this monitoring, data are reviewed as entered by [CONTACT_779], and the monitors will flag any abnormalities, trends, or safety signals for Medical Monitor review and monitor follow-up onsite, if necessary.  
During visits to the clinical site, the monitor may review the source documents including but not limited signed informed consent forms, study medication accountability and storage, and the 
reporting procedures for AE s and SAEs. All data generated during this study and the medical 
records/documents from which they originated are subject to inspection by [CONTACT_31474]/RevitaLid Inc., the FDA, and other regulatory agencies. The Inve stigator  must notify Oculos promptly of 
any inspections scheduled by [CONTACT_12721]. 
Upon completion of the study, the clinical monitor will conduct a final visit (closeout) to the site. 
The objectives of this visit are to ascertain that all regulatory records and reports are complete, verify that the study medication  and other supplies have been accounted for, and ensure that the 
Investigators are aware of their responsibilities once the study ends.  
The Investigator is responsible for permitting the Oculos  direct access to any study documents 
for monitoring and auditing purposes, for providing adequate space for monitoring, and for 
addressing any questions or issues that might be raised by [CONTACT_31480] a timely basis.  
13.6. Case Report Forms  and Study Records   
All data relating to study procedures will be entered by [CONTACT_387759]. The eCRF is the first place the majority of the study data will be recorded and therefore considered to be the source document. In general, paper source documents will not be created, but when generated, source documents (e.g., discharge summaries, etc.) will be retained at the 
study site. 
RVL -[ADDRESS_486044] be reported to 
Oculos upon discovery. A reportable protocol deviation is defined as nonadherence to the 
protocol that involves inclusion/exclusion criteria, affects subject safety, or has the potential to affect the integrity of the data. Protocol deviations should be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB guidelines. If there is any question as to whether the deviation is reportable, Oculos and the IRB should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
All changes to the protocol will be made by [CONTACT_1034]/Oculos or designee as an approved 
amendment to the protocol, submitted to the FDA, and approved by [CONTACT_14226].  
13.8. Access to Source Documentation  
A trial-related monitoring audit, review by [CONTACT_1201], and/or regulatory inspection may be conducted at any time during or after completion of a study ( Section  12). The Investigator will 
be given adequate notice if he/she is selected for an audit and must provide direct access to study documentation. The audit may include, but is not limited to, a review of all ICFs; a review of medical records; a review of regulatory documentation; an assessment of study conduct and protocol compliance; and a review of the investigational drug product receipt, storage, and administration.  
13.9. Data Generation and Analysis  
Management of data and the production of the clinical study report will be the responsibility of Oculos or their designee. 
During the course of the trial, data queries will be generated for data items that are potentially 
erroneous and require appropriate clarification or correction. Such clarifications and corrections will be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_31483]. Prior to database lock, data listings will be generated, and anomalous values inve stigated.  
13.9.1. Retention of Data

1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
 
This is a Phase  II study  of afatinib  with paclitaxel  in patients  with HER2 -positive  advanced  
esophagogastric  cancer  with progression  following  at least one trastuzumab -containing  
regimen.  The goal of this study  is to determine  the efficacy  of combined  inhibition  of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_61983]  (EGFR)  super  family  with an oral, specific,  irreversible  
inhibitor  of the ErbB  family  receptor  tyrosine  kinases  (IC50:  EGFR,  0.5 nM; HER2,  14 nM; 
HER4,  1 nM) with paclitaxel  in patients  with HER2 -positive  trastuzumab -refractory  advanced  
esophagogastric  cancer . Eligible  patients  ≥ [ADDRESS_298443] histologically  proven  
HER2 -positive  esophagogastric  cancer  (immunohistochemistry  3+ or FISH ≥2.0) with at least  
one site of measurable  metastatic  disease.  Correlative  tissue  will be done  to determine  the 
molecular  profile  that may predict  response  to afatinib  with paclitaxel.  We anticipate  the 
majority  of the patients  enrolled  will have pre- and post-treatment  biopsies  (if clinically  safe).  
 
 
 
 
2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary  objective  
 
1) The primary  objective  of this study  is to determine  toxicity,  safety  and tolerability  of 
afatinib  with paclitaxel  in patients  with metastatic  HER2 -positive  esophagogastric  
cancer.  
 
 
Secondary  objectives  
 
2) To estimate  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  of afatinib  and paclitaxel,  including  overall  
clinical  benefit  defined  as response  rate (ORR)  = stable  disease  (SD),  complete  
response  (CR) or partial  response  (PR),  median  overall  survival  and progression  free 
survival  (PFS).  
 
Exploratory  objectives  
 
1) To perform  exploratory  analysis  on available  archival,  pre- and post-treatment  tumor  
specimens  to determine  predictive  biomarkers  for afatinib  response.  
2) To utilize  cell-free tumor  DNA (cfDNA)  from  blood  specimens   collected  during  the 
course  of treatment  to explore  the mechanism  of primary  and acquired  resistance  to 
afatinib  therapy.  
3) To explore  changes  in 89 Zr-trastuzumab  PET with afatinib  treatment.

3.2 Human  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_209839]  (HER2)  in esophagogastric  
adenocarcinoma  
Human  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_209839]  (HER2)  is a validated  treatment  target  in 
esophagogastric  cancer,  based  on results  of the trastuzumab  in combination  with 
chemotherapy  versus  chemotherapy  alone  for treatment  of HER2 -positive  advanced  gastric  
or gastro -esophageal  junction  cancer  (ToGA):  a Phase  III, open -label,  randomized  controlled  
trial demonstrating  improved  response  and survival  when  trastuzumab  is added  to 
chemotherapy  (see section  3.3 for study  results).  Approximately  30% of stomach  
cardia/gastroesophageal  junction  (GE junction)  tumors  harbor  HER2  gene  amplification  
(assessed  by [CONTACT_245358]  [FISH]  and/or  HER2  oncoprotein  
overexpression  (assessed  by [CONTACT_9064]  [IHC]).7-9  The rise in the incidence  of 
gastroesophageal  junction  tumors  in Western  countries10,11   underscores  the significance  of 
this new target  in esophagogastric  cancer  and opens  a new drug development  strategy  for 
this disease.  
 
The ErbB2/HER2  oncogene  encodes  a transmembrane  tyrosine  kinase  receptor  that belongs  
to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_61983]  (EGFR)  family  and plays  an essential  role in 
promoting  cell growth,  migration,  differentiation,  proliferation,  and survival.  The family  
comprises  ErbB1  (EGFR/HER1),  ErbB2  (HER2/neu),  ErbB3  (HER3),  and ErbB4  (HER4).  
Each  receptor  has an extracellular  domain,  a lipophilic  transmembrane  domain,  and an 
intracellular  tyrosine  kinase  domain.  Activation  of the kinase  occurs  with ligand  binding  and 
hetero - or homodimerization  of these  receptors.  Ligand -independent  activation  of HER2  may 
occur  due to mutations  in HER2  or receptor  overexpression.12  HER2  activation  plays  a  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_245312]  3‟-kinase -AKT-mammalian  target  of rapamycin  
(PI3K -AKT-mTOR)  pathway.[ADDRESS_298445] demonstrated  that HER2  positivity  (IHC and/or  FISH)  is 
a prognostic  factor  associated  with worse  survival15-[ADDRESS_298446]  of HER2  status  was correlated  
with patient  outcome  using  univariate  and multivariate  analysis.  Interestingly,  median  overall  
survival  was longer  in HER2 -positvie  patients  (13.4  vs. 11.6 mos,  HR 0.74;  p=0.048)  on 
univariate  analysis.  This prognostic  value  disappeared  in multivariate  analysis  (p=0.3).  In 
addition,  HER2 -positive  disease  was not prognostic  in subgroup  analysis  based  on tumor

histology.20  Also worthy  of mention  is that in the phase  III ToGA  study,  the median  overall  
survival  of HER-2 positive  patients  on the control  arm (i.e., non-trastuzumab  arm) was similar  
to the historic  comparison  with Phase  III studies  of 5FU/Cisplatin  in metastatic  gastric  cancer.  
 
HER2  mediates  the transformed  phenotype,  and HER2  is a validated  therapeutic  target  in 
esophagogastric  adenocarcinoma,  based  on the results  of the Phase  III ToGA  study  (see 
section  3.3 for details).  The study  demonstrates  improved  survival  when  trastuzumab  is 
added  to chemotherapy.[ADDRESS_298447] 
higher  frequence  of incomplete  membranous  staining  (basolateral  only).  As a result,  these  
tumors  would  be scored  “negative”  by [CONTACT_245359].[ADDRESS_298448]  cancer  guidelines,  which  was later used  in the ToGA  trial. The new ASCO/CAP  HER2  
scoring  guidelines  (www.cap.org)  specify  that IHC score  0 should  be reserved  for tumors   
with no staining,  which  would  avoid  underscoring  the majority  of gastric  tumors. We recently  
published  results  of a validation  study  of HER2  scoring  (by [CONTACT_245360])  in 135 cases  with 
paired  IHC and FISH  results  using  the new ASCO/CAP  HER2  scoring  guidelines  for breast  
cancer  and the gastric  cancer  criteria  proposed  by [CONTACT_245361]. We recognize  that the 
basolateral  pattern  of immunoreactivity  in some  gastric  cancers  can result  in difficulty  
assigning  a definitive  IHC score.  Reliable  separation  of IHC 1+ and IHC 2+ patterns  can be 
particularly  challenging  in small  biopsy  specimens,  which  frequently  show  crush  and edge  
artifacts.  Having  a simple  and straightforward  interpretation  method  can significantly  reduce  
testing  variation.  We conclude  that HER2  assessment  in gastric  cancer  can be accurately  
performed  using  standard  breast  cancer  procedures  and the ASCO/CAP  scoring  criteria.  
While  IHC 0 and IHC 3+ provide  clear  stratification,  reliable  separation  of IHC 1+ and IHC 2+ 
may be difficult,  especially  in biopsy.  The latter  two groups  are best referred  to FISH  for 
definitive  classification.[ADDRESS_298449]  
MSKCC  HER2  testing  algorithm  for esophagogastric  adenocarcinoma,  patients  that are IHC 
1+ or 2+ will undergo  FISH  testing  to confirm  HER2  positivity.  Patients  with IHC 3+ or FISH+  
(>2 HER2:CEP17)  will be eligible  to receive  treatment  with afatinib  on this study.  
 
3.3 ToGA  study:  Trastuzumab  in HER2 -positive  esophagogastric  adenocarcinoma  
 
Trastuzumab  (Herceptin),  a humanized,  recombinant  monoclonal  antibody  that binds  to the 
extracellular  domain  of HER2  has been  shown  to exert  antitumor  effects  and is a key 
component  in the treatment  of early  and metastatic  HER2 -positive  breast  cancer.  26-28  With 
the results  of the Phase  III ToGA  study,  the benefit  of trastuzumab  in combination  with 
cisplatin  and fluoropyrimidine  (CF) chemotherapy  in HER2 -positive  metastatic  
esophagogastric  adenocarcinoma  has been  established.21  This study  comprised  584 patients  
with HER2 -positive  gastric  or GE junction  tumors.  Patients  were  randomly  assigned  to 
receive  cisplatin  and capecitabine  (fluorouracil  infusion  was given  to patients  who were  
unable  to take oral medication)  alone  or with trastuzumab,  a humanized  monoclonal  antibody  
against  the extracellular  region  of HER2.  Patients  assigned  to receive  trastuzumab  with 
chemotherapy  had a significant  improvement  in all measures  of efficacy,  including  overall  
survival  (13.8  vs. 11.1 months,  HR 0.74 [0.6-0.91],  p = 0.0046),  progression -free survival  (6.7

vs. 5.5 months),  and overall  response  rate (CR+PR)  (47 vs. 35%).  Notably,  patients  with 
strongly  HER2 -positive  tumors  (IHC 2+/FISH+  or IHC3+)  derived  the greatest  overall  survival  
benefit  with the addition  of trastuzumab  to chemotherapy  (16.0  vs. 11.8 months,  HR 0.68 
[0.5-0.83]).[ADDRESS_298450] biological  strategy  to show  a survival  benefit  in advanced  
esophagogastric  adenocarcinoma.  Trastuzumab  is now approved  by [CONTACT_245362]  (EMA)  for treatment  of patients  with HER2 -positive  advanced  gastric  cancer  in 
combination  with systemic  chemotherapy.  
 
3.4 Trastuzumab:  mechanism  of action  and the emergence  of resistance  
 
Trastuzumab  is approved  by [CONTACT_245363]2 - 
positive  advanced  gastric  cancer  in combination  with systemic  chemotherapy.  Resistance  to 
trastuzumab  is now emerging  in HER2 -positive  esophagogastric  cancer.  There  is no 
standard  of care treatment  at this time that has been  shown  to reliably  induce  a second  
response  in these  patients.  
 
Whereas  anti-HER2  therapy  with trastuzumab  has shown  efficacy  in some  HER2 -positive  
esophagogastric  cancer,  limitations  to this approach  can include  coincident  activation  of 
downstream  signaling  pathways.  In HER2 -positive  breast  cancer,  both de novo  and acquired  
resistance  to trastuzumab  are now recognized.29  Similar  mechanisms  of resistance  in 
esophagogastric  cancer  are expected,  the nature  of which  remains  to be investigated.  There  
are several  proposed  mechanisms  of action  of trastuzumab.30  By [CONTACT_245364]2,  trastuzumab  inhibits  homo - and heterodimerization  and 
activation  of the kinase,  leading  to downregulation  of the MAPK  and PI3K  signal -transduction  
pathways.  With cleavage  of the extracellular  domain  of HER2,  the phosphorylated  p95 
domain  may still activate  cellular  proliferation;  trastuzumab  binding  inhibits  this cleavage  
event.  Laboratory  models  suggest  that trastuzumab  recruits  immune  cells and may inhibit  
angiogenesis  leading  to tumor  regression  when  combined  with chemotherapy.[ADDRESS_298451]  cancer  (reviewed  by [CONTACT_245365]31). In 
breast  cancer,  one of the best characterized  mechanisms  of trastuzumab  resistance  involves  
increased  signaling  from other  EGFR  members  of EGFR  family  of receptors  (see section  
3.4.1).  
 
Activation  of the PI3K -AKT-mTOR  pathway  by [CONTACT_245366],  loss of the PTEN  
tumor  suppressor,  and mutational  activation  of PI3K  has been  demonstrated  to confer  
resistance  to trastuzumab  in animal  models  and a small  series  of clinical  tumor  samples  in 
breast  cancer.32  Increased  insulin -like growth  factor -1 receptor  (IGF-1R) signaling  is also 
associated  with PI3K -AKT activation  and trastuzumab  resistance.33,[ADDRESS_298452]  commonly  overexpressed  in HER2 -positive  tumors  and correlates  
with poor prognosis  and increased  propensity  to metastasize.  35-37  Lastly,  another  
mechanism  of resistance  to trastuzumab  is the accumulation  of a truncated  form of HER2  
(p95-HER2),  which  lacks  the extracellular  domain  needed  for trastuzumab  binding.  This 
truncated  receptor  maintains  kinase  activity  independent  of ligand  binding  and is able to 
activate  downstream  signaling  pathways.38

Through  a better  understanding  of these  models  of resistance,  new targeted  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_245313]2 -positive  esophagogastric  cancer  patients.  An 
approach  to overcome  trastuzumab -refractory  HER2  activity  is to block  the kinase  activity  of 
this receptor.  
 
3.4.1  Increased  signaling  from  HER  family  receptors  
 
EGFR  plays  a significant  role in trastuzumab  resistance.  Work  by [CONTACT_245367]  (p-EGFR),  EGFR,  EGFR/HER2  heterodimers,  and HER family  ligands  
EGF,  heparin -binding  EGF and heregulin.39  Furthermore,  the addition  of dual EGFR/HER2  
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  led to diminished  HER2  phosphorylation  and cellular  proliferation.39
 
 
The role of EGFR/HER2  cross -talk in transformation  and tumor  progression  is supported  by 
[CONTACT_245368].  For example,  coexpression  
of the EGFR  ligand  TGFα and Neu in the mammary  gland  of transgenic  mice  markedly  
accelerates  tumor  onset  and progression  compared  with mice expressing  Neu or TGFα 
transgenes  alone.  In this model,  TGFα x Neu bitransgenic  mice  exhibited  increased  tyrosine  
phosphorylation  of both EGFR  and HER2,[ADDRESS_298453]  patient  survival.42  In esophagogastric  
cancers,  EGFR  is commonly  overexpressed  (IHC)  and may signify  worse  prognosis.43,44  
Although  EGFR  overexpressing  MKN7  gastric  cancer  cells are insensitive  to trastuzumab,  in 
these  cells,  submicromolar  concentrations  of an EGFR  TKI, gefitinib,  inhibit  p-EGFR  and 
restore  sensitivity  to trastuzumab.39  These  data support  the rationale  for combined  blockade  
for EGFR  and HER2  in HER2 -driven  tumors.  
 
3.5 EGFR/HER2  Tyrosine  Kinase  Inhibitors  (TKIs)  
 
3.5.1  Reversible  EGFR/HER2 TKI- Lapatinib  
 
Lapatinib  is a reversible  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  of EGFR  and HER2  that blocks  receptor  
activation  by [CONTACT_245369].  This reversible,  
ATP-competitive  kinase  inhibitor  has shown  modest  activity  in HER2 -positive  breast  cancer  
Phase  II and III clinical  trials  and causes  responses  in some  patients  refractory  to 
trastuzumab,  suggesting  that suppression  of HER2  continues  to be useful  in this patient  
population.45,[ADDRESS_298454]  activity  has been  documented.  The South  Western  Oncology  
Group  (SWOG)  reported  a study  in unselected  patients  with advanced  gastric  cancer  where  
lapatinib  had a 9% (4 of 47 patients)  confirmed  partial  response  (PR) rate, one patient  had 
an unconfirmed  PR, and 23% (10 of 47) had stable  disease.  HER2  overexpression  was not 
required  for participation  in this study,  which  affected  the potential  efficacy  of the drug.  
Evaluation  of EGFR  or HER2  status  of the treated  patients  was not mandated  and not 
reported  and, therefore,  hindered  the interpretation  of the study  results.[ADDRESS_298455]  form by [CONTACT_245370].48  Presence  of either  
EGFR  overexpression  (IHC)  or HER2  overexpression  (IHC)  or HER2  gene  amplification  
(FISH)  were  required  for study  entry.  EGFR  overexpression  is not a predictor  of response  to 
HER2  directed  therapy.  Notably,  HER2  FISH  positivity  was unusually  high in this study,  43%

(9 of 21 patients)  in this small  sample,  which  leaves  the accuracy  of diagnostic  molecular  
analysis  of the cohort  in question.  Both of these  factors  may have affected  the efficacy  
results  of the study.  No objective  responses  were  reported;  2 patients  had durable  stable  
disease  (SD).  One patient  with SD for 5 months  had HER2  FISH -positive/IHC  3+, EGFR  3+ 
gastroesophageal  junction  adenocarcinoma;  the other  patient  with SD for 9 months  had 
HER2  FISH  negative/IHC  2+, EGFR  1+ esophageal  adenocarcinoma.  Another  study  of 
lapatinib  in patients  with HER2 -positive  (FISH)  solid tumors  included  esophagogastric  
patients.  One of 16 patients  achieved  durable  complete  response  for over 1 year and one 
other  patient  had disease  stabilization  for 9 months.49 
 
Lapatinib  is currently  being  tested  in two Phase  III trials  in gastric  cancer.  TYTAN  is an open - 
label,  randomized  Phase  III study  comparing  paclitaxel  with paclitaxel  plus lapatinib  in 
patients  with HER2  FISH -amplified  gastric  cancer  as a second -line therapy.  The primary  end 
point is overall  survival,  and 260 patients  will be enrolled  (clinicaltrials.gov  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
As regards  the first-line setting,  the LOGiC  trial will compare  capecitabine  and oxaliplatin  with 
or without  lapatinib  in advanced  gastric  cancer  and GE junction  with HER2  amplification  by 
[CONTACT_4656];  overall  survival  is the primary  end point (clinicaltrials.gov  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
 
3.5.2  Irreversible  EGFR/HER2  TKIs  
In vitro data suggest  that second -generation  irreversible  inhibitors  that covalently  bind HER2  
and EGFR  (unlike  lapatinib,  which  compete  with ATP in a reversible  manner)  may be able to 
overcome  trastuzumab  resistance.  In HER2 -positive  breast  cancer  patients  with trastuzumab  
resistance,  the reported  efficacy  profile  seen  with one such  irreversible,  dual EGFR/HER2  
inhibitor  (neratinib)  compares  favorably  with the monotherapy  experiences  with other  anti- 
HER2  agents.50 Neratinib  demonstrates  16-week  PFS rates  of 59% for HER2 -positive  breast  
cancer  patients  with prior trastuzumab  treatment  and 78% for patients  with no prior 
trastuzumab  treatment.  Objective  response  rates  were  24% among  patients  with prior 
trastuzumab  treatment  and 56% in the trastuzumab -naïve  cohort.50
 
3.6 Afatinib: clinical experience 
 
Afatinib  (BIBW  2992)  is a highly  selective  and potent  low molecular  weight,  irreversible  
inhibitor  of the erbB-family  tyrosine  kinase  receptors  EGFR,  HER2,  and HER4.  The potency  
of afatinib  was determined  in enzymatic  assays  using  recombinant  human  wild type EGFR,  
HER2,  and HER4  that revealed  IC50 values  of 0.[ADDRESS_298456]-line treatment  of patients  with 
metastatic  non-small  cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  whose  tumors  had specific  EGFR  gene  
mutations  (exon  19 deletions  or exon  21; i.e., L858R  substitution  mutations)  as detected  by 
[CONTACT_245371]. Afatinib  is currently  in Phase  III in NSCLC,  colorectal  cancer,  
trastuzumab -pretreated  HER2 -positive  breast  cancer,  and head  and neck squamous  cell 
carcinoma  (HNSCC).

and erlotinib/gefitinib  (LUX -Lung  1), a subgroup  analysis  demonstrated  a 3.5 month  benefit  in 
PFS;  1 vs. 4.5 months,  HR=0.35  (95%  CI 0.24,  0.497)  in patients  with clinically  defined

Afatinib  has single  agent  activity  in HER2 -positive  esophagogastric  cancer.  With one PR, the

together  will be better  than single -agent  therapy.  In patients  with HER2 -positive  early  stage  
breast  cancer  Baselga  et al demonstrated  that pCR rate is significantly  higher  in the group  
given  lapatinib  and trastuzumab  (78 of 152 patients  [51·3%;  95% CI 43·1–59·5])  than in the 
group  given  trastuzumab  alone  (44 of 149 patients  [29·5%;  22·4–37·5];  difference  21·1%,  
9·1–34·2,  p=0·0001).  No major  cardiac  dysfunctions  occurred  in this study.  Frequency  of 
Grade  3 diarrhea  was higher  with lapatinib  (36 patients  [23·4%])  and lapatinib  plus 
trastuzumab  (32 [21·1%])  than with trastuzumab  (three  [2·0%]).  Similarly,  Grade  3 liver- 
enzyme  alterations  were  more  frequent  with lapatinib  (27 [17·5%])  and lapatinib  plus 
trastuzumab  (15 [9·9%])  than with trastuzumab  (11 [7·4%]).[ADDRESS_298467]  frequent  adverse  events  were  diarrhea,  
rash,  nausea,  and fatigue;  diarrhea  was higher  in the combination  arm (P = .03). The 
incidence  of symptomatic  and asymptomatic  cardiac  events  was low (combination  therapy  = 
2% and 3.4%;  monotherapy  = 0.7%  and 1.4%,  respectively).  [ADDRESS_298468].  
 
In vivo studies  in HER2 -positive  gastric  cancer  showed  that the combination  of lapatinib  and 
trastuzumab  had greater  antitumor  efficacy  than either  drug alone.  64  In addition,  second - 
generation  irreversible  EGFR/HER2  TKIs may be more  attractive  drugs  than lapatinib.  These  
TKIs covalently  bind the tyrosine  kinase  domain  and initial  studies  compare  favorably  with  
the monotherapy  experiences  with lapatinib  (which  competes  with ATP in a reversible  
manner).[ADDRESS_298469]

Diarrhea  had been  the DLT observed  in 1/6 patients  at the 20 mg afatinib  dose  level and in

further  8 patients  were  treated  with 20 mg afatinib  daily plus weekly  trastuzumab,  the overall  
incidence  of DLTs  was 4 out of 13 evaluable  patients  (31%).  All DLT events  reported  during  
the first treatment  cycle  were  cases  of CTCAE  Grade  [ADDRESS_298474]  frequently  
reported  AEs were  diarrhea,  rash,  decreased  appetite,  fatigue,  and nausea.  Prophylactic  
loperamide  was not used  on this study;  the diarrhea  was treated  after Grade  2 or 3 diarrhea  
developed.  
 
Another  Phase  I trial of afatinib  with trastuzumab  (8 mg/kg  loading  dose;  6 mg/kg  
maintenance  every  3 weeks)  determined  the MTD of afatinib  [ADDRESS_298475] 10 days on therapy.  On the prior 
afatinib  with trastuzumab  trials the patients  were  managed  with anti-diarrheal  agents  only 
after significant  diarrhea  developed.  
 
Based  on available  toxicity  and efficacy  data,  on the present  trial, a starting  dose  of afatinib  
30 mg will be used  in order  to optimize  the efficacy/toxicity  balance.  Prophylactic  loperamide  
will be mandatory  on this study,  with weekly  toxicity  assessments  and MD visit. Variability  is 
expected  in the incidence  and severity  of adverse  events  and dose  de-escalation  to 20 mg is 
planned,  if required.  
 
Three  patients  will be treated  with Afatinib  30 +trastuzumab  q2wks  with loperamide  
prophylaxis.  If no patients  experience  Grade  ≥3 diarrhea  with prophylactic  loperamide,  a new 
cohort  of patients  will be enrolled  at dose  Afatinib  40 mg +trastuzumab.  If however  [ADDRESS_298476] Grade  ≥3 diarrhea  at dose  30 mg, the cohort  will be expanded  to 6. If no 
further  DLT occurs,  patients  will be enrolled  at dose  Afatinib  40 mg +trastuzumab.  If 2 of 6 
patients  experience  Grade  ≥3 diarrhea,  the MTD will be defined  as the dose -level below  
which  this occurred.  If 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 subjects  experience  DLT at 30 mg then Afatinib  will be 
deescalated  to 20 mg. 
 
3.8.1  Correlative  science:  determinants   of  resistance  to  trastuzumab   and 
sensitivity  to afatinib  and trastuzumab  
Members  of the ErbB  family  of receptor  tyrosine  kinases  have proven  critical  in oncogenesis,  
and in the case  of esophagogastric  cancer,  ErbB2/HER2  overexpression  is seen  in up to 
30% of adenocarcinomas.  Effective  targeted  therapy  against  the HER2  receptor  was initially  
achieved  with the monoclonal  antibody,  trastuzumab  though  there  are patients  who do not 
respond  or eventually  progress  on therapy.  Several  models  of trastuzumab  resistance  have 
been  proposed  and a better  understanding  of the mechanisms  that underlie  resistance  will 
aid in the development  of rational  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].[ADDRESS_298477],

response;  those  tumors  which  lack PTEN expression  had significantly  fewer  responses  to 
trastuzumab  than those  with normal  PTEN  expression.  Using  human  breast  cancer  cells 
lines these  researchers  demonstrated  that knockdown  of PTEN  resulted  in increased  AKT 
activity  and diminished  growth  inhibition  by [CONTACT_30522].71  Loss or reduced  expression  of 
PTEN  protein  is associated  with tumorigenesis  and metastasis  in gastric  cancer.  Yang  et al 
examined  184 cases  of gastric  carcinoma.  Their  adjacent  normal  mucosa  and dysplasia  
were  evaluated  for PTEN  protein  expression  by [CONTACT_245380].  PTEN  
expression  was compared  with tumor  stage,  lymph  node  metastasis,  Lauren's  and WHO's  
histological  classification  of gastric  carcinoma.  The positive  rates  of PTEN  protein  were  
100%  (102/102),  98.5%  (65/66),  66.7%  (4/6) and 47.8%  (88/184)  in normal  mucosa,  IM, 
dysplasia  and carcinoma  of the stomach,  respectively.  The positive  rates  in dysplasia  a nd 
carcinoma  were  lower  than in normal  mucosa  and IM (P<0.01).  Advanced  gastric  cancers  
expressed  less frequent  PTEN  than early  gastric  cancer  (43 % vs. 68%,  P<0.[ADDRESS_298479]  that PTEN  status  in HER2 -overexpressing  esophagogastric  
tumors  may be used  as a predictor  of trastuzumab  response.  
 
 
In addition  to PTEN  status,  activating  mutations  in the gene  encoding  the catalytic  subunit  of 
PI3K (PI3KCA)  have  been  identified  and may contribute  to trastuzumab  resistance  through  
increased  PI3K signaling  and AKT phosphorylation.  Berns  and colleagues  used  
immunohistochemical  analysis  and gene  sequencing  to determine  PTEN  and PI3KCA  
mutational  status  in 55 trastuzumab -refractory  tumor samples;  reduced  PTEN  expression  
was seen  in 22% of tumors,  while  mutations  of PI3KCA  were  seen  in 25% of tumors.  Kaplan - 
Meier  survival  curves  demonstrate  shorter  progression -free survival  among  patients  with 
PI3KCA  mutations,  and taken  together  with PTEN  loss, these  factors  may serve  as  
predictors  for the development  of trastuzumab  resistance.  
 
 
Recognizing  that aberrations  in the PI3K  pathway  may mediate  resistance  to trastuzumab,  
the growth  factor  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  IGF1  receptor  (IGF1 -R), that plays  a role in 
activation  of this signaling  pathway,  has come  under  investigation.  HER2 -overexpressing  
human  breast  cancer  cells lines transfected  with IGF1 -R and treated  with trastuzumab  had 
diminished  inhibition  of cell proliferation.  With the addition  of an inhibitor  of IGF1 -R signaling,  
sensitivity  to trastuzumab  was restored.[ADDRESS_298480]  activation.34

Another  mechanism  of resistance  to trastuzumab  therapy  is the accumulation  of truncated  
forms  of the HER2  receptor  lacking  the trastuzumab -binding  domain.  Truncation  of HER2  at 
the amino  terminal  leads  to p95HER2  receptor  which  maintains  kinase  activity  in the  
absence  of ligand  binding;  cell lines transfected  with p95HER2  are resistant  to trastuzumab.  
These  cell lines maintain  sensitivity  to lapatinib,  suggesting  that these  tumors  retain  their 
dependence  of HER2.  Retrospective  analysis  of tumor  samples  has confirmed  that p95HER2  
expression  is strongly  associated  with trastuzumab  resistance  while  tumors  expressing  full- 
length  HER2  maintained  sensitive  to trastuzumab.[ADDRESS_298481]  so the possibility  
of multiple  concurrent  “mechanisms  of resistance”  has not been  excluded.  
 
By [CONTACT_245381]-trastuzumab  (when  tissue  is available)  and resistant  tumor  for 
mutational  changes  in HER2  and PI3K  and for expression  changes  in p95-HER2,  PTEN,  
EGFR,  HER3,  and IGF1 -R, further  validation  of mechanisms  of resistance  to trastuzumab  
and other  anti-HER2  therapy  may occur.  By [CONTACT_245382]-treatment  biopsies,  we may be able to predict  and 
select  patients  for this or other  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  We will correlate  these  profiles  with clinical  
response  to afatinib  therapy.  Tissue  can be used  for future  studies  to characterize  
trastuzumab  resistance.  
 
 
We will profile  genomic  alterations  in key cancer -associated  genes  found  to drive 
trastuzumab  resistance  in preclinical  studies  using  the IMPACT  assay  developed  at MSKCC.  
This bait capture,  next generation  sequencing  assay  is capable  of identifying  point  mutations,  
small  insertion/deletion  events  (indels),  and large  gene  level and intragenic  copy number  
aberrations  in [ADDRESS_298482] validated  the robustness  of this assay  using  DNA derived  from formalin -fixed,  paraffin  
embedded  (FFPE)  tumor  tissue.  For specimens  in which  <70%  of the tissue  comprises  viable  
tumor,  macrodissection  will be performed  to minimize  stromal  contamination.  Normal  DNA   
will be derived  from blood  using  QIAGEN  PAXgene  Blood  DNA  Tubes  or comparable  tubes.  
Tumor  DNA will be prepared  from frozen  section  when  available,  and if not, from formalin - 
fixed paraffin -embedded  (FFPE)  blocks  using  the DNEasy  tissue  kit (Qiagen).  In parallel,  p- 
AKT,  IGF1 -R, HER3,  HER4,  c-MET and p95-HER2  levels  in ERRB2 - amplified  EG tumor

samples  collected  at the time of disease  progression  and pretreatment  tumors  from the same  
patient  will be quantitated  using  a proteomics -based  CEER  (Collaborative  Enzyme  Enhanced  
Reactive -immunoassay,  Prometheus  Labs)  assay.  In prior studies,  CEER  has showed  
superior  accuracy  when  compared  with IHC.77 
Expected  Outcomes/Statistical  Considerations.  Our preliminary  data in trastuzumab  
refractory  breast  cancer  studies  and the published  literature  on EG cancer  suggest  that many  
of the actionable  alterations  such  as PIK3CA , ERBB2 , PTEN  mutation,  presence  of p95- 
HER2  or loss of PTEN  are likely to be found  in 5%-15% of ERBB2 -amplified  EG cancer  
tumors.  Clinical  data such  as magnitude  of response  to trastuzumab -based  therapy  (stable  
disease,  partial  response,  complete  response)  and time to development  of trastuzumab  
resistance  will be collected  on all patients  to compare  differences  in outcome  as a function  of 
mutational  status.  We will generate  a multivariate  model  incorporating  mutational  status  and 
clinical  predictors  of outcome  such as age, performance  status,  and stage.  Given  the sample  
size, this will be an exploratory  analysis  of correlative  biomarkers.  Presence  of mutations  
(categorized  as a binary  variable)  in pre- and post-treatment  tissue  samples  will be  
correlated  with overall  clinical  benefit  to afatinib  using  Fishe r‟s exact  test. 
3.9 Update  on Second -line Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_245315]2  EG Cancers  
 
In second -line settings,  several  recent  Phase  III studies  exploring  lapatinib  (EGFR/HER2  
reversible  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor)  or trastuzumab  emtansine  (or T-DM1;  an antibody -drug 
conjugate  consisting  of the trastuzumab  linked  to the cytotoxic  agent  DM1) failed  to meet  the 
primary  endpoint  and therefore  no standard  exists  for HER2  directed  therapy  after 
trastuzumab  progression.  
T-DM1  
 
The Phase  II/III GATSBY  [CONTACT_245383] T-DM1 compared  to 
paclitaxel  alone  in second -line advanced  gastric  cancer  and failed  to show  a primary  
endpoint  efficacy  benefit  of T-DM1 over paclitaxel  (Median  OS 7.9 vs. 8.6 mos.;  HR 1.13 
p=0.31).78 
Failure  of T-DM1 does  not eliminate  HER2  as a target  in second -line esophagogastric  
cancer.  HER2 -positive  esophagogastric  cancer  in second -line therapy  is a clinically  and 
biologically  aggressive  disease.  The Phase  II/III GATSBY [CONTACT_245384]1 was unsuccessful  in inducing  response  in platinum  and fluropyrimidine  refractory  
gastric  tumors.   Much  remains  to be learned  about  ERBB2  as a driver  in esophagogastric  
cancer.  As our understanding  of the genomic  subtypes  of gastric  cancer  deepens,  it is 
becoming  clear  that co-occurring  genomic  aberrations  impact  the efficacy  of HER2  targeted  
agents.  According  to the Cancer  Genome  Atlas analysis  of the four distinct  molecular  gastric  
cancer  subtypes79, HER2 -positive  tumors  are characterized  by [CONTACT_245385]  (CIN),  
marked  aneuploidy,  and dependency  on receptor  tyrosine  kinase  signaling.  It is therefore  
possible  that recurrent  amplification  in key tyrosine  kinases  (such  as EGFR80, HER365,  
HER4) contributed to T-DM1 resistance. 
Ramucirumab

Lapatinib  and TDM -1 failed  in second -line settings,  and a combination  of paclitaxel  with 
ramucirumab  (monoclonal  antibody  against  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  receptor  2 
[VEGFR2])  remains  the standard  second -line therapy  for HER2 -positive  esophagogastric  
cancer  patients.  The RAINBOW  trial demonstrated  an improved  survival  and response  rate 
for the combination  of ramucirumab  with paclitaxel  compared  to placebo  with paclitaxel  in 
second -line therapy  of metastatic  gastric  adenocarcinomas  (median  OS 9.6 vs. 7.4 months,  
Median  PFS was 4.4 and 2.9 months).81 
 
 
3.10 Preliminary  toxicity  and efficacy  of afatinib  and trastuzumab  
 
Initially,  this was a single -agent  afatinib  study  in trastuzumab  refractory  patients.  We 
subsequently  amended  the study  to treat patients  with afatinib/trastuzumab  based  on 
possibly  higher  efficacy  of afatinib/trastuzumab  as demonstrated  in the preclinical  model.  
 
We treated  12 patients  with afatinib  and trastuzumab  with prophylactic  loperamide  and 
frequent  toxicity  assessments  due to the concerns  of excessive  diarrhea.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_245316] 30 mg from 40 mg, afatinib  30 mg and trastuzumab  was 
associated  with a higher  rate of Grade  3 treatment -related  toxicity  with afatinib/trastuzumab  
compared  with single  agent  afatinib  40 mg daily.  Intolerable  Grade  2 diarrhea  required  dose  
reductions  in 42% of patients.  Diarrhea  was difficult  for patients  to tolerate  despi[INVESTIGATOR_245317].  Grade  3 toxicities  attributable  to afatinib/trastuzumab  included  
creatinine  increase,  dehydration,  hypokalemia,  and hypophosphatemia  despi[INVESTIGATOR_245318].  The tables  3.1.1  and 3.1.2  summarize  the efficacy  
data,  dose  reductions  and toxicity  data to date from the two cohorts.

These  data suggest  that the combination  of afatinib  and trastuzumab  results  in a higher  rate 
of toxicity.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_245319],  75% of patients  experience  
significant  diarrhea  needing  dose  reductions.  Lower  afatinib  doses  and poor absorption  due 
to diarrhea  may have  contributed  to limited  efficacy  of this regimen.  Given  that only 1 
response  was observed  out of 12 patients  treated,  the probability  of observing  4 or more  
responses  out of the remaining  14 patients  treated  with afatinib  and trastuzumab  and 
determine  is regimen  promising  is very low. Furthermore,  the emerging  data from the 
negative  TDM1  Phase  II/III GATSBY  [CONTACT_245386] -line therapy  in HER2 -positive  
esophagogastric  cancer  as an unmet  therapeutic  need.  
 
The negative  T-DM1 trial suggests  that there  may be minimal  benefit  to trastuzumab  beyond  
progression.   To help shed  light on mechanisms  of trastuzumab  resistance,  we analyzed  
samples  from 80 patients  had Stage  IV HER2 -positive  (IHC 3+, IHC2+/FISH+)  EG 
adenocarcinoma  using  a NGS assay  -MSK -IMPAC.  Seventy -one samples  were  collected  
pre-trastuzumab,  [ADDRESS_298484]-trastuzumab,  and 28 with paired  pre/post  samples.  In the paired  
samples,  we observed  post-therapeutic  loss of HER2  amplification  (16%);  gain of new AMP 
of MET (7%),  EGFR  (4%),  and IGF1R  (4%);  MUT in ERBB4  (14%),  KRAS  (11%),  PIK3CA  
(7%),  MTOR  (7%).  These  data highlight  the secondary  alterations  in the RTK/RAS/PI3K  
pathway  in patients  with acquired  trastuzumab  resistance  (Janjigian  submitted  ESMO  2016).  
This molecular  data and the clinical  data from the GATSBY  [CONTACT_10665] -showing  failure  of T-DM1 - 
suggests  that HER2  monoclonal  antibody  will be insufficient  to induce  responses  and 
questions  the utility  of trastuzumab  beyond  progression  in trastuzumab  refractory  gastric  
cancer.  Paclitaxel  is standard  therapy  in second -line settings  in gastric  cancer.  The 
hypothesis  is that the combination  of afatinib  and paclitaxel  will result  in an overall  survival  
improvement  compared  to standard  therapy  with paclitaxel  and ramucirumab  in second -line 
patients  with HER2 -positive  esophagogastric  cancer.  
 
 
3.11 Development Plan for Afatinib with Paclitaxel in HER2-positive EG Cancer

Afatinib  demonstrates  clinical  activity  in heavily  pretreated  patients  with metastatic  HER2 - 
positive  esophagogastric  cancer  after disease  progression  on trastuzumab  with 
chemotherapy  warranting  further  investigation  in trastuzumab  refractory  gastric  cancer.  The 
combination  of afatinib  with trastuzumab  was not dramatically  better  and is associated  with 
higher  toxicity;  therefore  we plan to develop  afatinib  in combination  with paclitaxel.  A Phase  
II/III trial of afatinib  with paclitaxel  vs. ramucirumab  with paclitaxel  in second -line settings  in 
HER2 -positive  EG cancer  was proposed  by [CONTACT_245387].  This trial was well received  and supported  by [CONTACT_245388], with the request  to generate  toxicity  data for afatinib  with 
paclitaxel  in second -line patients  with HER2 -positive  EG cancer.  We plan to amend  the 
current  trial to stop accrual  to the afatinib/trastuzumab  combination  and treat the remaining  
14 patients  with afatinib  and paclitaxel.  The enrollment  plan is outlined  in the section  below.  
3.12 Safety of Paclitaxel with Afatinib 
 
The randomized  LUX-Lung  582  study  demonstrated  in 202 patients  with afatinib  refractory  
tumors  that the combination  of afatinib  with paclitaxel  is safe,  and treatment -related  adverse  
events  were  consistent  with those  previously  reported  with each  agent.  In this trial, 48% of 
patients  receiving  afatinib  plus paclitaxel  and 30% of patients  receiving  single -agent  
chemotherapy   experienced  drug-related  Grade  3/4 adverse  events.  Afatinib  plus paclitaxel  
improved  PFS and ORR  compared  with single -agent  chemotherapy   in patients  EGFR  
mutant  NSCLC  (median  5.[ADDRESS_298485]  ratio [HR] 0.60,  P=0.003)  and ORR  
(32.1%  versus  13.2%,  P=0.005)  significantly  improved  with afatinib  plus paclitaxel.  There   
was no difference  in OS, due to cross -over design  and overall  favorable  prognosis  of patients  
with EGFR  mutant  lung carcinoma.  Global  health  status/quality  of life was maintained  with 
afatinib  plus paclitaxel  over the entire  treatment  period.82  Several  randomized  trials 
demonstrated  no benefit  for addition  of EGFR  TKIs (erlotinib  or gefitinib)  to chemotherapy  in 
non-enriched  patient  population  including  EGFR  wild-type and KRAS  mutant  tumors.  
Although  no benefit  was detected,  these  treatments  are not detrimental.  KRAS  mutations  do 
not occur  in HER2 -positive  esophagogastric  cancer.  There  is no data to suggest  that the 
combination  of an EGFR  TKI and chemotherapy  is antagonistic.  Riely  et al. demonstrated  
that the combination  of erlotinib,  carboplatin,  and paclitaxel  is safe and well tolerated  with 
response  rates  and survival  similar  to those  reported  for carboplatin,  paclitaxel,  and 
bevacizumab  in lung cancer  patients.83 
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a multi-institution,  open -label,  non-randomized,  Phase  II evaluation  of oral afatinib  
(daily)  and intravenous  paclitaxel  (weekly,  3 weeks  on, 1 week  off) in patients  with 
trastuzumab  refractory  HER2 -positive  metastatic  or recurrent  esophagogastric  
adenocarcinoma.  Patients  are eligible  if they experience  progression  of disease  on 
trastuzumab -based  therapy;  other  chemotherapy  regimens  may have been  administered  
between  the time of progression  on the prior trastuzumab -containing  regimen  and the start of 
this protocol  therapy.  All patients  with disease  technically  amenable  to biopsy  will be asked

to undergo  a biopsy  for tissue  correlative  studies  during  pretreatment . Per the investigato r‟s 
discretion,  MSK patients  only will be asked  to undergo  a second  biopsy  after one week  of 
therapy  (with  a +7 day window).  The pretreatment  biopsy  can occur  any time prior to initiation  
of afatinib,  following  consent  (see section  9.0). At the discretion  of the MSK Principal  
Investigator,  select  participants  who show  response  on this study  and then progress  may be 
asked  to have an optional  third biopsy.  
 
 
All patients  must  be able to provide  informed  consent  prior to enrollment.  
See Section  10 for treatment  table.  
 
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
All patients  receiving  therapy  on trial with afatinib  and trastuzumab  will continue  on afatinib  
and trastuzumab  until disease  progression  or intolerable  toxicity.  All additional  patients  will 
be enrolled  on afatinib  and paclitaxel  cohort..  
 
Fourteen  patients  will be treated  with afatinib  and paclitaxel  combination.  Patients  will receive  
oral afatinib  40 mg daily plus paclitaxel  80 mg/m2 intravenously  on day 1, 8, and 15 of a 28- 
day cycle.  
 
Up to two 10 mg dose  reductions  of afatinib  will be permitted  if patients  encountered  any 
Grade  ≥3 drug-related  adverse  events  (AEs;  assessed  according  to National  Cancer  Institute  
Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  [NCI-CTCAE]),  or Grade  2 diarrhea  lasting  
≥2 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_245320] , or nausea  or vomiting  for ≥[ADDRESS_298486] supportive  care.  The paclitaxel  dose  will be reduced  by 10 mg/m2  for the following  cycle  
when  NCI-CTCAE  Grade  4 hematological  toxicity  or Grade  3 paclitaxel -related  non- 
hematological  toxicity  (except  for alopecia)  is observed.  If the dose  of paclitaxel  is reduced  
because  of potentially  related  AEs, subsequent  dose  increases  are not permitted.  Paclitaxel  
will be permanently  discontinued  if dose  reduction  to less than 60 mg/m  [ADDRESS_298487] measurable  disease  and will undergo  a computerized  tomography  (CT) 
or magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI) scan  of the chest  and abdomen  within  14 days of start 
of therapy,  at eight  weeks,  and every  eight  weeks  thereafter  (every  2 cycles),  with a 
scheduling  window  of up to one to fourteen  (1-14) days.  Response  assessment  will be by 
[CONTACT_393]  1.1 criteria84. The same  imaging  modality  performed  at baseline  (CT or MRI) will be 
repeated  at subsequent  imaging.  
 
 
Therapy  will be administered  in the outpatient  setting,  with each  cycle  consisting  of 28 days 
of continuous  therapy.  The cycle  start date will coincide  with the physician  visit date.  If a 
patient  is held or unable  to come  in at the cycle start date,  a new pi[INVESTIGATOR_245321]: 11 -166 A(14)

the previous  visit. A study  diary will be completed  by [CONTACT_245389] (see APPENDIX A). 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
 
5.1 Afatinib 
 
Pharmaceutical  form:  Film-coated  tablets  
 
Source:  Boehringer  Ingelheim  Pharma  GmbH  & Co. KG 
 
Unit strength:  40 mg, 30 mg and 20 mg film-coated  tablets  (dose  of afatinib  in the film- 
coated  tablets  is free-base  equivalent  of afatinib)  
 
Daily  dose:  40 mg, 30 mg or 20 mg 
 
Duration  of use: Continuous  daily dosing;  one course  consists  of 28 days.  Patients  are 
eligible  for repeated  treatment  cycles  in the absence  of disease  progression  and undue  
adverse  events  (as per criteria  in Section  9). 
 
Route  of administration:  Oral (swallowed)  
 
Posology:  Once  daily 
 
5.2 Trastuzumab  
Pharmaceutical  form:  Trastuzumab  is commercially  available,  and is a recombinant  DNA- 
derived  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  that selectively  binds  with high affinity  in a cell- 
based  assay  (Kd = 5 nM) to the extracellular  domain  of the human  epi[INVESTIGATOR_245322]  2 protein,  HER2.  The antibody  is an IgG1 kappa  that contains  human  framework  
regions  with the complementarity -determining  regions  of a murine  antibody  (4D5)  that binds  
to HER2.  
The humanized  antibody  against  HER2  is produced  by a mammalian  cell (Chinese  Hamster  
Ovary)  [CHO]  suspension  culture  in a nutrient  medium  containing  the antibiotic  gentamicin.  
Gentamicin  is not detectable  in the final product.  Trastuzumab  is a sterile,  white  to pale 
yellow,  preservative -free lyophilized  powder  for intravenous  (IV) administration.  Each  vial of 
trastuzumab  contains  400 mg of trastuzumab,  9.9 mg of L-histidine  HCl, 6.4 mg of 
L-histadine,  400 mg of ,-trehalose  dihydrate,  and 1.8 mg of polysorbate  20, USP.  
Reconstitution  with 20 mL of the supplied  Bacteriostatic  Water  for Injection  (BWFI)  USP,  
containing  1.1%  benzyl  alcohol  as a preservative,  yields  21 mL of a multidose  solution  
containing  21 mg/mL  trastuzumab,  at a pH of ~6. 
 
Source:  For this study,  locally  obtained  commercial  supplies  of trastuzumab  will be used.  
 
Dosage and Administration: Trastuzumab will be administered on an every 2 week dosing 
schedule,  4 mg/kg  every  [ADDRESS_298488] 4 weeks  prior to study  enrollment  will require  initial  loading  dose  of trastuzumab  6 
mg/kg  over 90 minutes,  followed  by [CONTACT_30522]  4 mg/kg  every  2 weeks  over 30 mintues  . 
 
 
Preparation  and Storage:  Trastuzumab  will be prepared  and administered  as per MKSCC  
guidelines.  Please  refer to the FDA-approved  package  insert  for additional  information.

Route  of administration:  every  2 weeks  
 
Cardiac  Dysfunction:  Signs  and symptoms  of cardiac  dysfunction  were  observed  in a 
number  of women  who received  trastuzumab  alone  or in combination  with chemotherapy,  
most  often  anthracycline  based  treatment.  Cardiac  dysfunction  was observed  most  
frequently  among  patients  who received  trastuzumab  plus AC chemotherapy  (28%),  
compared  with those  who received  AC alone  (7%),  trastuzumab  plus paclitaxel  (11%),  
paclitaxel  alone  (1%),  or trastuzumab  alone  (7%).  Severe  disability  or fatal outcome  due to 
cardiac  dysfunction  was observed  in ~1% of all patients.  The signs  and symptoms  of cardiac  
dysfunction  usually  responded  to treatment.  All patients  must  have a baseline  evaluation  of 
cardiac  function  including  a measurement  of LVEF  by [CONTACT_245390].  Only patients  with normal  LVEF  should  be entered  into this study.  All should  
have regular  cardiac  monitoring  throughout  the study  per the site investigato r‟s discretion . It 
is suggested  that the first evaluation  occur  4 months  after the initiation  of trastuzumab  
therapy.  During  the course  of trastuzumab  therapy,  patients  should  be monitored  for signs  
and symptoms  of CHF (i.e., dyspnea,  tachycardia,  new unexplained  cough,  neck vein 
distention,  cardiomegaly,  hepatomegaly,  paroxysmal  nocturnal  dyspnea,  orthopnea,  
peripheral  edema,  and rapid  unexplained  weight  gain).  The diagnosis  must  be confirmed  
using  the same  method  used  to measure  LVEF  at baseline  (either  ECHO  or MUGA).  
 
Management  of Symptomatic  Cardiac  Changes . Patients  who develop  signs  and symptoms  
of CHF should  have  trastuzumab  held and should  receive  treatment  for CHF as prescribed   
by [CONTACT_30553]  (e.g.,  ACE inhibitors,  angiotensin -II receptor  blockers,  β-blockers,  diuretics,  and 
cardiac  glycosides,  as needed;  HFSA guidelines).  Consideration  should  be given  to obtaining  
a cardiac  consultation.  
 
If the symptoms  of CHF resolve  with treatment,  and cardiac  function  improves,  Trastuzumab  
may be continued  after discussion  with the patient  concerning  the risks and benefits  of 
continued  therapy.  If the patient  is benefiting  clinically  from Trastuzumab,  the benefit  of 
continued  treatment  may outweigh  the risk of cardiac  dysfunction.  If Trastuzumab  is 
restarted,  continued  surveillance  with noninvasive  measures  of LVEF  (MUGA or ECHO)  is 
strongly  recommended  until cardiac  function  has normalized.  
 
Management  of Asymptomatic  Decreases  in LVEF.  Trastuzumab  may be continued  in 
patients  experiencing  an asymptomatic  absolute  decrease  in LVEF  of <20 percentage  points  
from baseline,  when  the ejection  fraction  remains  within  the imaging  cente r‟s range  of normal  
limits.  Per the site investigato r‟s discretion,  srepeat  measures  of LVEF  should  be obtained  
using  the methodology  selected  at baseline.  Close  follow -up of such  patients  is 
recommended.  Patients  with an asymptomatic  absolute  decrease  in LVEF  of >[ADDRESS_298489] trastuzumab  held 
and be considered  for treatment  of incipi[INVESTIGATOR_245323]  (e.g.,  ACE 
inhibitors,  angiotensin -II receptor  blockers,  β-blockers,  diuretics,  and cardiac  glycosides,  as 
needed;  see HFSA  guidelines).  In light of the variability  inherent  in the assessment  of  
ejection  fraction,  consideration  should  be given  to repeating  the study  to confirm  an observed  
decline.  Repeat  measures  of LVEF  should  be obtained  using  the same  methodology   
selected  at baseline.  If trastuzumab  has been  discontinued  for an asymptomatic  decline  in 
LVEF,  a repeat  measure  of LVEF  will be obtained  in 1 month  to determine  if the decline  has 
resolved.  
 
If cardiac  function  improves,  trastuzumab  may be restarted  after discussion  with the patient  
concerning  the risks and benefits  of continued  therapy.  If the patient  is benefiting  clinically  
from Trastuzumab,  the benefit  of continued  treatment  may outweigh  the risk of cardiac  
dysfunction.  If trastuzumab  is restarted,  continued  surveillance  with noninvasive  measures  of

study  treatment  (with the exception  listed  in section  9.0). 89 Zr-trastuzumab  use as 
imaging  agent  for 89 Zr-trastuzumab  PET permitted.  Afatinib  is a substrate  of P-gp 
and its plasma  concentrations  can be affected  by [CONTACT_2224] P-gp inhibitors  (data  
on file) and it is also likely  that P-gp inducers  could  also influence  afatinib  plasma  
concentrations.  
 
• The use of potent  P-gp inhibitors  (including  cyclosporine,  erythromycin,  
ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  quinidine,  Phenobarbital  salt with quinidine,  ritonavir,  
valspodar,  verapamil)  and potent  P-gp inducers  (including  St John's  wort,  
rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513])  has to be avoided  during  treatment  with afatinib.  Any exemptions  to 
this have to be discussed  with the principal  investigator.  
 
7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
This will be a multi-institution,  Phase  II study.  Patients  with metastatic  or recurrent  
esophageal,  gastric  and gastroesophageal  (GE) junction  cancer  that are eligible  will be 
identified  for enrollment  from MSKCC  clinical  practice  and clinic  lists. No additional  
measures,  e.g. advertisement,  payment  to patients,  will be employed  to recruit  patients.  
Patients  will be accrued  to this study  without  regard  for gender  or minority  status.  
 
Similar  recruitment  procedures  will be followed  at participating  institutions.  
 
Participating  site recruitment  will be conducted  as outlined  within  the protocol.  Any 
participating  sites that require  a limited  waiver  must  obtain  it from their own site IRB/Privacy  
Board  (PB) via a separate  protocol  addendum  or request.   It is the responsibility  of the MSK 
staff to confirm  the participating  data collection  sites have a limited  waiver  approved  by [CONTACT_245393](s)/PBs.  
 
Inclusion  of women  and minorities  
 
The investigators  take due notice  of the NIH policy  concerning  inclusion  of women  and 
minorities  in clinical  research  populations.  There  will be no limitation  with regards  to race or 
gender.  
 
 
Our institutional  demographics  for accrual  of patients  on esophageal,  gastric  and GE junction  
cancer  trials reflect  the national  incidence  of this disease:  10-15% of our patients  have been  
women;  African -American  males  comprise  3-5% of patients  treated  on protocol.  Given  that 
our protocol  accrual  closely  reflects  the national  incidence  of this disease,  no specific   
strategy  will be undertaken  to recruit  women  or persons  of color  on this trial. 
 
 
This protocol  does not include  children  because  the number  of children  with esophageal,  
gastric  and GE junction  cancer  is very small  and because  the majority  are already  accessed  
by a nation -wide pediatric  cancer  research  network.  This statement  is based  on exclusion  4b 
of the NIH Policy  and Guidelines  on the Inclusion  of Children  as Participants  in Research  
Involving  Human  Subjects.

8.1 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
Pretreatment  evaluation  will be performed  within  2 weeks  of study  entry  and will include:  
• History,  concomitant  medications,  and toxicity  assessment.  
• Physical  exam,  vital signs,  and performance  status.  
• Serum  pregnancy  test for women  of childbearing  potential  (WOCP)  
In addition,  all WOCP  should  be instructed  to contact  [CONTACT_245394]  (e.g. late or missed  period)  at any time during  
study  participation.  
• CT scan or MRI of all relevant  disease  sites within  2 weeks  of study  entry.  
• Laboratory  evaluation  including  complete  blood  count,  magnesium  and 
comprehensive  chemistry  panel  (includes  BUN,  creatinine,  ALT, AST,  albumin,  
glucose,  total protein,  calcium,  bilirubin,  bicarbonate,  sodium,  chloride,  potassium,  
alkaline  phosphatase)  
 
The following  must  be obtained  within  one month  prior to starting  protocol  therapy:  
• Electrocardiogram  
• Assessment  of Left Ventricular  Ejection  Fraction  (LVEF)  as measured  by 
[CONTACT_245395].  The same  method  of 
measurement  has to be used  throughout  the study.  
• Biopsies  of tumor:  An initial  biopsy prior to the start of therapy  (specific  tumors  that 
have progressed  on trastuzumab  will be biopsied  if at all possible)  for the correlative  
studies  for all patients  whose  tumors  are feasible  to biopsy  is required.  Patients  with 
tumor  not technically  amenable  to be safely  biopsied  may be allowed  to participate  in 
the study  (see section  9 for exceptions).  
• When  available,  primary  tumor  samples  of the patients  will be obtained  and analyzed.  
 
To be completed  any time prior to starting  therapy:  
• Histological  confirmation  of esophagogastric  adenocarcinoma  at enrolling  institution  
prior to study  enrollment.  Patients  without  histological  confirmation  of recurrence  or 
metastasis  will undergo  a biopsy  to confirm  recurrence,  unless  the risk of such a 
procedure  outweighs  the benefits  of confirming  recurrent  disease.  
 
 
9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
9.2 Afatinib Administration 
 
Afatinib  will be self-administered  by [CONTACT_245396].  The starting  dose  of 
afatinib  is 30 mg orally  once  daily for 28 days (continuously).  Three  patients  will be treated  with 
Afatinib  30 +trastuzumab  q2wks  with loperamide  prophylaxis.  If no patients  experience  Grade  ≥3 
diarrhea  with prophylactic  loperamide,  a new cohort  of patients  will be enrolled  at dose  Afatinib  40 
mg +trastuzumab.  If however  [ADDRESS_298494] Grade  ≥3 diarrhea  at dose  30 mg, the cohort  will 
be expanded  to 6. If no further  DLT occurs,  patients  will be enrolled  at dose  Afatinib  40 mg 
+trastuzumab.  If 2 of 6 patients  experience  Grade  ≥3 diarrhea,  the MTD will be defined  as the dose -

level below  which  this occurred.  If 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 subjects  experience  DLT at 30 mg then Afatinib  
will be deescalated  to 20 mg. 
 
 
1) Afatinib  is supplied  as 40 mg, 30 mg and 20 tablets.  There  is no planned  interruption  between  
treatment  cycles  unless  clinically  indicated.  The cycle  start date will coincide  with the physician  
visit date.  Because  of the potential  need  for physician  visit scheduling  to vary (due to both 
physician  and patient  issues),  to avoid  violation  of, and deviation  from,  the protocol,  physician  
visits  may vary by [CONTACT_209858]  (1-14) days from a strict [ADDRESS_298495] scan,  and after consultation  with the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_245325].  
Additionally,  treatment  may be held or skipped  in the event  of a protocol  related  biopsy.  The 
tablet  should  be swallowed  with a glass  of water  (~250  mL). Afatinib  tablets  are film-coated 
and therefore  should  not be chewed  or crushed,  but may be administered  via G-tube after 
dispersing  the afatinib  tablets  according  to the following  procedure:  Place  the tablet  into a 
glass  containing  50 mL isotonic  sodium  chloride  solution.  Stir until the tablet  is broken  up into 
very fine particles  (about  15 minutes).  Drink  the suspension  immediately  or administer  via a 
gastric  tube.  Rinse  the glass  with another  50 ml of isotonic  sodium  chloride  solution  and drink 
or administer  the supplementary  solution  via the gastric -tube again  (to pi[INVESTIGATOR_245326]/gastric -tube).  Patients  with emesis  should  not take a replacement  
dose.  If a dose  of afatinib  is missed,  it should  be taken  during  the same day as soon  as the 
patient  remembers.  However,  if the next scheduled  dose  is due within  [ADDRESS_298496]  be skipped.  A study  diary will be completed  by [CONTACT_245397]  (see APPENDIX  A). Missed  doses  should  be recorded  on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_245327] a patient  develops  intolerable  toxicity  that meets  criteria  for dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  other  than 
hypomagnesemia  (for DLT definition  refer to Section  9.2) regardless  of treatment  cycle,  treatment  
with afatinib  must  be paused.  If all drug-related  toxicities  recover  to CTCAE  version  4 Grade  1 or 
baseline  (whichever  is higher)  within  [ADDRESS_298497]  not been  met. Once  afatinib  is dose  reduced,  the patient  should  not go back  to

9.6 Concomitant  Therapy  
 
The use of investigational  or anticancer  agents  is not allowed  while  patients  are on this study.  
However,  symptomatic  treatment  of tumor -associated  symptoms  is allowed,  such  as radiation  
therapy  with palliative  intent  and dose  for symptom  control.  Concomitant  medication,  or therapy  to 
provide  adequate  supportive  care,  may be given  as necessary.  If concomitant  therapy  (e.g.,  
radiation)  is clinically  indicated,  patients  may temporarily  discontinue  afatinib  therapy  and resume  
treatment  following  consultation  with the treating  physician  and principal  investigator.  89 Zr- 
trastuzumab  use as imaging  agent  for 89 Zr-trastuzumab  PET is permitted.  
 
 
Antidiarrheal Treatment 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 11 -166 A(14)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_298501]  therapy  to treat diarrhea  as clinically  indicated  
in this study.  Second -line antidiarrheal  treatments  and adjunctive  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (e.g.,  Lomotil  
(Diphenoxylate  and Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050])  (or equivalent  as approved  by [CONTACT_1142])  are also recommended  for 
use when  appropriate.  
 
 
Biopsies  of tumor  
 
An initial  biopsy  prior to the start of therapy  is required  for the correlative  studies  evaluating  the 
biologic  effects  of afatinib.  It will be obtained  for all patients  whose  tumors  are feasible  to biopsy.  For 
MSK patients  only,  a second  biopsy*  (occurring  after one week  of therapy  (+ 7 day window),  see 
study  calendar)  will also be obtained  at the investigato r‟s discretion.  
 
At the discretion  of the MSK Principal  Investigator,  select  participants  who show  response  on this 
study  and then progress  may be asked  to have an optional  third biopsy.  
 
Examples  of conditions  under  which  biopsies  should  not be performed  include:  
 
• It is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_245328] a biopsy  would  involve  too great  of risk (e.g. tumor  
near a blood  vessel,  significant  risk of perforation).  In this scenario,  the treating  physician  must  both 
document  the reason  for not doing  the biopsy  and must  discuss  and have permission  from the 
principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_7966]  (Yelena  Janjigian,  MD). 
• Platelet  count  is less than 60,000.  
 
• Patient  is on anticoagulation  therapy  with either  Coumadin  or Heparin  and are unable  to be taken  
off it safely  temporarily  for the biopsy  to be done.  
*Note:  It is possible  that a patient  will be eligible  for the first biopsy,  but will not be required  to have  
the second  biopsy  due to an unforeseen  circumstance  (i.e., patient  does not have  viable  tissue).  
This will be at the discretion  of the investigator.  
 
 
 
Collection of blood of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 
 
Cell-free DNA  (cfDNA)  will be obtained  from plasma  samples  collected  at baseline,  every  8 weeks,  
and at the time of treatment  discontinuation  
Approximately  20 ml of whole  blood  per visit (baseline,  every  8 weeks,  and treatment  
discontinuation)  will be collected  at ambient  temperature  into 2x 10mL  cell free DNA  BCT tubes  for 
plasma  isolation.

Baseline  research  bloods  will be collected  on Cycle  1, Day 1 prior to treatment  administration.  A 
window  of +/-7 days is permitted  for research  bloods  completed  every  8 weeks  and at treatment  
discontinuation  
9.7 Dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  
 
 
 
Suggested  medical  management  of afatinib  and trastuzumab  associated  toxicities  is outlined  in 
section  9.7. Suggested  afatinib  dose  modifications  are outlined  in section  9.8. A dose -limiting  toxicity  
(DLT)  is defined  as an adverse  event  or laboratory  abnormality  that is: a) considered  to be related  to 
the study  regimen;  b) meets  any of the following  criteria:  
 
• CTCAE  Grade  2 or higher  decrease  in cardiac  left ventricular  function  
 
• CTCAE  Grade  [ADDRESS_298502]  anti- 
diarrheal  therapy  
• CTCAE  Grade  ≥[ADDRESS_298503] two days 
 
• CTCAE  Grade  ≥3 nausea  and/or  vomiting  despi[INVESTIGATOR_245329]-emetics  for at 
least three  days 
 
• CTCAE  Grade  ≥[ADDRESS_298504]  medical  management  . 
 
• CTCAE  Grade  ≥3 fatigue  lasting  for more  than seven  days 
 
• All other  toxicities  of CTCAE  Grade  ≥3 (except  alopecia,  and allergic  reaction)  leading  to an 
interruption  of afatinib  for more  than 14 days until recovery  to baseline  or Grade  1, whichever  is 
higher.

(during  the first few weeks  of treatment).  Primary  prophylactic  use of antidiarrheal  
medication  is mandatory  for patients  taking  afatinib  and trastuzumab,  unless  constipation  is 
present  at baseline.  Patients  with constipation  at baseline  will be excluded  from prophylactic  
treatment.  Loperamide  is the recommended  standard  therapy  to treat diarrhea  in this study.  
Alternative  antidiarrheal  medication  proposal  will be based  on investigator  discretion  and the 
reason  documented  in the source  documents.  
. Second -line antidiarrheal  treatments  and adjunctive  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (e.g.,  Lomotil  (Diphenoxylate  
and Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050])  (or equivalent  as approved  by [CONTACT_1034])  are also recommended  for use 
when  appropriate.  
 
Inform  patients  that they will experience  diarrhea  while  taking  protocol  treatment.  
• Administer  loperamide:  initial  dose  of 4 mg (2 tablets/capsules)  with the first dose  of 
afatinib  and trastuzumab,  followed  by 2 mg (1 tablet/capsule)  every  6- 8 hours  for 1 
cycle  of therapy.  Patients  should  be given  prescription  of Lomotil  at the initiation  of 
afatinib  therapy.  For patients  with persistent  Grade  1 diarrhea  (<4 stools  per day 
above  baseline)  on loperamide,  Lomotil®  (diphenoxylate  hydrochloride  and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_245331])  1 tablet  (2.5 mg) every  6 to 8 hours  should  be added  (or per investigator  
discretion).  
• Patients  with baseline  constipation  are exempt  from mandatory  prophylactic  
loperamide  after discussion  with site PI. 
• Prophylactic  loperamide  administration  may continue  for subsequent  cycles  at the 
physician's  discretion.  
• For Grade  2 diarrhea  during  Cycle  1 (4 to 6 stools  per day above  baseline,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_245332]-diarrheal  therapy),  consider  adding  tincture  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_245333]  
(short -acting)  150 µg subcutaneous  [SC] injection  3 times  a day, or after initial  dose  
of short -acting  octreotide,  if well tolerated,  a single  dose  of octreotide  LAR 20 mg by 
[CONTACT_245399]  (equivalent  medication  may be used  with approval  of the 
Sponsor).  
• Instruct  patients  to promptly  report  diarrhea  symptoms.  
• Instruct  patient  to record  the number  of stools  per day and the dose  of any anti- 
diarrheal  medication  taken  each  day for the first cycle  of therapy  only

the mechanisms  underlying  response  and resistance  (de novo and acquired)  to targeted  therapy  
using  pretreatment,  on-treatment,  and/or  post treatment/progression  tumor  tissue,  patients  will 
be asked  to provide  tissue  from pretreatment,  post-treatment,  and post-progression  on 
afatinib/trastuzumab  therapy,  and blood  (one 3mL EDTA  tube)  one month  prior to starting  
treatment  and at any time-point  on study.  
 
 
Pre-treatment  tissue  for the correlative  studies  evaluating  the biologic  effects  of afatinib  and

Approval date: [ADDRESS_298514]-treatment  biopsy  for MSK patients  only should  happen  within  1 week  (+ 7 day window)  after 
the initiation  of therapy.  At the discretion  of the MSK Principal  Investigator,  select  participants  
who show  response  on this study  and then progress  may be asked  to have an optional  third 
biopsy.  The patient  will continue  taking  afatinib  without  interruption.  Pre- and post-treatment  
tumor  biopsies  will be performed  to evaluate  biomarker  expression  and target  inhibition  
(described  below).  In addition,  archived  tissue  from prior tumor  biopsies  obtained  at the time of 
cancer  diagnosis,  and prior to initiation  of trastuzumab  will be analyzed,  when  available.  Our 
primary  aims  are to identify  changes  in expression  of specific  biomarkers  or in the genomic   
HER2  sequence  as a result  of afatinib  and trastuzumab  therapy  in patients  with HER2 - 
overexpressed  esophagogastric  cancer  with trastuzumab -resistant  disease.  All patients  with 
disease  technically  amenable  to biopsy  will be asked  to undergo  a pre-treatment  with afatinib  
biopsy  of their metastatic  disease  or primary  tumor  as well as consent  to evaluate  their primary  
tumor  biopsy  or resection  specimens  for comparative  studies.  Per the investigator ‟s discretion,  a 
post-treatment  biopsy  will be obtained  for MSK patients  only. Specific  tumors  that have 
progressed  on trastuzumab  will be biopsied  if at all possible.  Patients  who meet  inclusion  criteria  
will be assessed  for a site of disease  that is amenable  to biopsy.  After obtaining  informed  
consent,  a diagnostic  biopsy  will be performed  either  by [CONTACT_209854]  (sonogram  guided  
core biopsy  or stereotactic  biopsy)  or endoscopy.  The appropriate  type of a diagnostic  biopsy  will 
be determined  by [CONTACT_245401].  
The biopsy  specimen  will be accessioned  and sent to pathology  for routine  analysis  (histology,  
tumor,  grade,  HER2  by [CONTACT_9064]  (IHC),  and HER2  by [CONTACT_245402]  (FISH)).  Where  possible,  multiple  cores  will be obtained.  When  only one core is 
obtained,  half the core will be snap  frozen  using  liquid  nitrogen  with a section  evaluated  for the 
presence  of invasive  carcinoma  by a participating  pathologist  and stored  for later analysis.  The 
second  and larger  sample  will be formalin  fixed and used  for IHC studies.  
 
 
• The number  of biopsies  taken  will be based  on the clinical  judgment  of the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541],  
surgeon  or interventional  radiologist,  but ideally  will be less than or equal  to four. In the 
unlikely  event  that only one core specimen  is obtained  for local recurrenc  e, priority  will be 
given  for use for clinically  necessary  studies.  
• For the purposes  of mutational  analysis,  RNA isolation  will be carried  out after 
macrodissection  using  approximately  25 µg of gross  tissue  from the tumor  specimens.  RNA 
extraction  will be performed  using  TRIZOL  reagent  (Gibco -BRL,  Gaithersburg,  MD) and the 
Qiagen  RNeasy  Kit (Qiagen,  Valencia,  CA). RNA  purity  and quality  will be assessed  by 
[CONTACT_245403] A260  and A280  and visualization  after running  on a denaturing   
agarose  gel. The individual  exons  of the HER2  gene  will be amplified  by [CONTACT_937]-PCR  and 
sequenced  using  standard  methods.  Hotspot  mutations  in PIK3CA  will be determined  using  a 
Sequenom  prevalidated  assay.  These  studies  will test if mutations  in HER2,  PI3KCA,  or 
PTEN  are found  in patients  with resistance  to anti-HER2  therapy.

In regards  to the return  of genomic  data,  the protocol  consent  form asks participants  for 
permission  for re-contact  [CONTACT_245404]  (i.e. IMPACT  assay).  These  incidental  findings  may be critical  to 
the patient  and/or  family ‟s preventative  care.  If an MSKCC  participant  agrees  to be re- 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530],  he or she will not be told the specific  results  of the research  test, but will be 
informed  that his or her samples  were  analyzed  and a potential  risk was uncovered.  If the 
participant  is interested  in further  discussion  of the research  findings,  he or she will be asked  
to come  into the MSKCC  Clinical  Genetics  Service  for counseling  and specific  genetic  
testing.  If a participating  site participant  agrees  to have  tissue  sent to MSK for our secondary  
objective  with IMPACT  testing  and s/he wished  to be re-contact[CONTACT_245405],  then 
any significant  incidental  findings  uncovered  during  IMPACT  testing  will be relayed  to the 
treating  physician  at the treating  institution  so they may carry out their institution ‟s policy  with 
regard  to offering  the patient  confirmatory  testing  and genetic  counseling.  
 
 
In the event  an investigato r‟s research  identifies  a finding  that he or she believes  should  be 
communicated  to the participant,  the investigator  shall communicate  this to the IRB Genomic  
Advisory  Panel.  The finding  will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_1201]/PB  Genomic  Advisory  Panel  (GAP)  
to determine  whether  the incidental  finding  should  be discussed  with the participant.  In the 
event  that the group  convened  by [CONTACT_245406],  and the participant  has consented  to be re-contact[INVESTIGATOR_530],  then the 
treating/consenting  physician  shall be contact[CONTACT_245407].  
 
 
For MSK patients,  after appropriate  counseling  and consent,  the Clinical  Genetics  Service  
will request  permission  to confirm  the result  in a [LOCATION_001] DOH -approved  laboratory  prior to 
communication  of the specific  result.  If the patient  is not available  (e.g. deceased)  then the

11.1 Definitions  of adverse  events  
 
Adverse  event  
An adverse  event  (AE) is defined  as any untoward  medical  occurrence,  including  an exacerbation  of 
a pre-existing  condition,  in a patient  in a clinical  investigation  who received  a pharmaceutical  
product.  The event  does not necessarily  have to have a causal  relationship  with this treatment.  
Severity  of adverse  event  
The severity  of the AE should  be judged  based  on the following:  
The severity  of adverse  events  should  be classified  and recorded  according  to the Common  
Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  Version  [ADDRESS_298521]  be recorded  for each  adverse  event.  
 
Causality  will be reported  as either  “Yes”  or “No”.  
 
Yes: There  is a reasonable  causal  relationship  between  the investigational  product  
administered  and the AE.

No: There  is no reasonable  causal  relationship  between  the investigational  product  
administered  and the  AE. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_298522] one of the following  criteria  is met: 
– The worsening  of the disease  constitutes  an SAE.  
– Additional  treatment  is required;  i.e., concomitant  medication  is added  or changed.  
– An unexpected  deterioration  from baseline  has occurred  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2339].  
 
11.3 Worsening  of pre-existing  conditions  
 
A pre-existing  condition  present  at baseline,  which  remains  unchanged  during  the trial, does not 
need  to be recorded  as adverse  event.  Any worsening  of any pre-existing  baseline  condition  should  
be reported  as an adverse  event.  Examples  of worsening  of a preexisting  condition  that should  be 
recorded  as an AE are given  below;  
• Worsening  of condition  meets  the criteria  for an SAE 
• Action  is taken  with the investigational  drug (i.e. dose  is reduced  or treatment  is 
discontinued)  
• Treatment  is required  (concomitant  medication  is added  or changed)  
• The investigator  believes  a patient  has shown  a clear  deterioration  from baseline  symptoms  
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
All patients  who receive  at least one week  of afatinib  and trastuzumab  combination  therapy  will be 
evaluable  for toxicity  and response.  Patients  who are unable  to complete  one week  of afatinib  
therapy  will not be evaluated  for toxicity  or response  and will be replaced  by a new patient.  
 
The primary  endpoint  of the study  is the efficacy  of the combination  of daily afatinib  and trastuzumab  
in terms  of the overall  clinical  benefit  defined  as response  rate (ORR)  = stable   disease   (SD) 
complete  response  (CR) and partial  response  (PR) at [ADDRESS_298523]  1.1 criteria  assessed  
after every  8 weeks  ±[ADDRESS_298524]  1.1 criteria.  The same  imaging  modality  performed  at 
baseline  (CT or MRI) will be repeated  at subsequent  imaging.  
 
Secondary  endpoints  include  toxicity,  safety  and tolerability,  progression  free survival  (PFS)  at 4 
months.  The type, frequency,  severity,  timing,  and relationship  of each  adverse  event  will be 
determined  as per the NCI Common  Toxicity  Criteria,  version  4.0. Toxicity  during  cycle  1 and 
subsequent  cycles  will be reported.  Given  the small  sample  size, the analysis  of correlative  
biomarkers  will be exploratory  and hypothesis  generating.

IRB Number: 11 -166 A(14)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_298525]  1.1 criteria.  
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
If at any time the patient  develops  progressive  disease  he/she  will be taken  off study  and referred  for 
alternative  therapy.  If at any time the patient  develops  unacceptable  toxicity  that fails to resolve  after 
a maximum  treatment  delay  of 4 weeks,  he/she  will be removed  from study.  Before  being  removed  
from the study,  patients  will be scanned  to assess  the response.  If the off study  scan  shows  
progression  of disease  then the patient  will be considered  as a non responder,  while  a CR or PR will 
be considered  as response.  If the off study scan  shows  SD and the patient  has been  on study  for 
less than 3 months  than the patient  will be considered  as non responder  whereas  if the patient  has 
been  on study  for longer  than 3 months  and has SD at the off study  scan  then the patient  will be 
counted  as having  had clinical  benefit.  
 
A patient  will be withdrawn  from the study  treatment  in the following  circumstances:  
 
● the patient  is no longer  able to participate  in the study  (e.g.,  AE, surgery,  concomitant  diagnoses,  
concomitant  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_245338]);  in such  a case the Investigato r‟s reason  for a 
patient ‟s removal  must  be recorded  in CRDB.  
● Patient  withdrawal  of consents  or election  to discontinue  participation  in the trial . 
● Significant  deviation  from the protocol  or eligibility  criteria;  such  patients  will be considered  
protocol  violations  and removed  from study.  
● Non-compliance  with study  or follow -up procedures.  
● Drug -related  AE(s)  have not resolved  after 4 weeks  of treatment  interruption.  Exception  to this in 
patients  who derive  obvious  clinical  benefi t according  to the investigato r‟s judgment  could  be 
considered  upon  discussion  with site Principal  Investigator.  The dose -reduction  scheme  provided  
should  be followed  in this case.  
● Repeated  epi[INVESTIGATOR_245339]-related  toxicity  despi[INVESTIGATOR_245340]  20 mg or dose  
interruption.  
● Documented  progressive  disease.  
 
As soon  as a patient  is withdrawn  from the study  treatment,  the end-of-treatment  (EOT)  visit must  be 
performed  (not if patient  has withdrawn  consent).  Every  effort  should  be made  to follow -up patients   
in case  an adverse  event  is still ongoing  at the time of withdrawal.  
Patients  who show  a clinical  benefit  from treatment  with afatinib  and trastuzumab  (i.e., with either  an 
objective  tumor  response  or the absence  of disease  progression),  may continue  to receive  additional  
treatment  courses.  Patients  with radiologically  documented  progressive  disease  should  be removed  
from the study  unless  the investigator  judges  it to be of clinical  benefit  for the patient  to continue  on 
trial therapy.

(CR),  or partial  response  (PR) at [ADDRESS_298527] to follow  up without  a 
4 months  scan will be treated  as events  (non-responder).  
 
 
A Simon ‟s minimax  two-stage  design  will be used  with unacceptable  response  rate of 5% against  an 
acceptable  response  rate of 20%.  The design  chosen  has a 5% type I error rate and 80% power.  
There  is no standard  of care treatment  at the time of trastuzumab  resistance  that has been  shown  to 
reliably  induce  a second  response  in these  patients.  The 5% was chosen  because  the cohort  of 
patients  that will be accrued  for this study  will be heavily  treated,  with no standard  of care options  for 
treatment.  Based  on the background  data presented  in section  3.5.1,  we have  chosen  a target  
response  rate below  5% will not be worthy  of further  consideration.  We plan to treat [ADDRESS_298528] stage,  then another  14 patients  (for 
total of 27 patients)  will be treated  on the study.  If 4 or more  objective  responses  are observed  in 
these  27 patients,  then the treatment  with afatinib  will be considered  worthy  for further  investigation  
in HER2 -positive  gastric  cancer.  Probability  of early  termination  is 51%.  
 
 
OS, PFS and PFS at [ADDRESS_298529]-treatment  (after  1 week  of afatinib  (+7 day window))  tissue  for the correlative  studies  
evaluating  the biologic  effects  of afatinib  will be obtained.  An exploratory  analysis  of correlative  
biomarkers  will be performed.  Expression  levels  of the different  biomarkers  (categorized  as binary)  
in pre- and post-treatment  tissue  samples  will be correlated  with overall  clinical  benefit  to afatinib  
using  Fishe r‟s exact  test. To evaluate  whether  changes  in the expression  level of the different  
biomarkers  between  pre- and post-treatment  correlate  with overall  clinical  benefit  to afatinib,  
conditional  logistic  regression  will be employed  to account  for the paired  nature  of the data.  We 
anticipate  that all patients  on whom  the biopsies  are feasible  will have  pre- and post-treatment  
biopsies.  In addition,  archived  tissue  from prior tumor  biopsies  obtained  at the time of cancer  
diagnosis,  and prior to initiation  of trastuzumab  will be analyzed,  when  available.  
 
 
June 2013  amendment:  
 
 
Afatinib  has single  agent  activity  in HER2  positive  esophagogastric  cancer.  With one PR, the study  
met the criteria  for expansion  of the accrual  based  on original  Simon ‟s minimax  two-stage  design.  
Preclinical  data in gastric  cancer  and clinical  experience  in lung and breast  cancers  suggest  that we 
can improve  this response  rate by [CONTACT_245410].  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 11 -166 A(14)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_298530]  binomial  single  stage  design  will be used  with unacceptable  response  rate of 7% against   
an acceptable  response  rate of 25%.  Based  on recent  data emerging  on single  agent  afatinib   
activity,  we have  chosen  a target  response  rate below  7% for the combination  of afatinib  and 
trastuzumab  will not be worthy  of further  consideration.  We plan to treat a total of 26 patients  with 
afatinib  and trastuzumab.  If 5 or more  responses  are observed  in these  26 patients,  then this regimen  
will be considered  worthy  for further  investigation  in HER2 -positive  esophagogastric  cancer.          
The design  chosen  has a 5% type I error rate and 80% power.  
 
 
Three  patients  will be treated  with Afatinib  30 +trastuzumab  q2wks  with loperam  ide prophylaxis.  If no 
patients  experience  Grade  ≥3 diarrhea  with prophylactic  loperamide,  a new cohort  of patients  will be 
enrolled  at dose  Afatinib  40 mg +trastuzumab.  If however  [ADDRESS_298531]  Grade  ≥3 diarrhea  at 
dose  30 mg, the cohort  will be expanded  to 6. If no further  DLT occurs,  patients  will be enrolled  at 
dose  Afatinib  40 mg +trastuzumab.  If 2 of 6 patients  experience  Grade  ≥3 diarrhea,  the MTD will be 
defined  as the dose -level below  which  this occurred.  If 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 subjects  experience  DLT at 30 
mg then Afatinib  will be deescalated  to 20 mg. 
 
 
April 2016  amendment:  
 
 
Initially,  this was a single -agent  afatinib  study  in trastuzumab  refractory  patients.  We subsequently  
amended  the study  to treat patients  with afatinib/trastuzumab  based  on efficacy  of 
afatinib/trastuzumab  demonstrated  in the preclinical  model.  
 
 
We treated  12 patients  with afatinib  and trastuzumab  with prophylactic  loperamide  and frequent  
toxicity  assessments  due to the concerns  of excessive  diarrhea.  Afatinib  30 mg (lowered  from 40 
mg) and trastuzumab  was associated  with a higher  rate of Grade  3 treatment -related  toxicity..  
Intolerable  Grade  2 diarrhea  required  dose  reductions  in 42% of patients  treated  with afatinib  and 
trastuzumab.  Diarrhea  was difficult  for patients  to tolerate  despi[INVESTIGATOR_245341].  
 
 
The combination  of afatinib  and trastuzumab  would  have been  deemed  promising  if [ADDRESS_298532] been  observed  out of the proposed  sample  size of 26 patients.  Given  that 
only 1 response  was observed  out of 12 patients  treated,  if the true response  rate for afatinib  
+trastuzumab  is 25%,  the probability  of observing  4 or more  responses  out of the remaining  14 
patients  treated  with afatinib  and trastuzumab  would  be 48%.  Therefore,  the power  of the study  
would  be very low. 
 
 
This power  is further  diminished  to 4% if the true response  rate is 10%,  and it‟s 15% if the true 
response  rate is 15%.  The probability  is still low: 64% if the response  rate is 30%.  So the probability  
(power)  of having  a successful  trial (having  continued  until the end of 26 patients)  is small  under  
reasonable  response  rates.

The purpose  of this amendment  is to generate  safety  and toxicity  data for a combination  of afatinib  
with paclitaxel  in HER2 -positive  EG cancer.  We plan to stop accrual  to the afatinib  trastuzumab  
combination  and treat the remaining  14 patients  with afatinib  and paclitaxel.  
 
 
A sample  size of 14 patients  will provide  90% probability  to observe  at least 1 AE if  the  true 
incidence  of the AE in the population  is 15% or more.  This probability  is 77% if the true underlying  
AE rate is 10% and it is 51% if the true underlying  AE rate is 5%. Exact  95% confidence  intervals  
will be computed  for the incidence  of AEs. 
 
 
Descriptive  statistics  will be used  to calculate  and tabulate  for endpoints  assessing  safety,  
tolerability,  and anti-tumor  activity  in each  treatment  cohort:  1) afatinib,  2) afatinib  and trastuzumab,  
3) afatinib  and paclitaxel.  Progression -free and overall  survival  will be analyzed  using  Kaplan -Meier  
methodology.  The biomarkers'  objectives  will be accomplished  across  all the 3 cohorts.  If the 
combination  of afatinib  and paclitaxel  is proven  tolerable  in this cohort  of patients,  we plan to further  
explore  this combination  in a randomized  Phase  II trial.

Auditing  
Each  participating  site accruing  participants  to this protocol  may be audited  by [CONTACT_245411],  data verification  and source  documentation.  Audits  of 
selected  participant  records  may be conducted  on-site or remotely.  
 
Audits  will be summarized  and a final report  will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_245343]  30 days of the audit.  The report  will include  a summary  of findings,  participant - 
specific  case  review,  recommendations  on any performance  and/or  shortcomings  and 
request  for corrective  action,  when  necessary.  When  corrective  action  is required,  the 
participating  site must  reply within  45 days of receipt  of the audit  report  with their corrective  
action  plan. 
 
16.1.2  Response  Review  
 
Since  therapeutic  efficacy  is a stated  primary  objective,  all sites participants ‟ responses  are 
subject  to review  by [CONTACT_245412]‟s Therapeutic  Response  Review  Committee  (TRRC).  Radiology,  
and additional  lab reports   will need  to be obtained  from the participating  sites for MSK TRRC  
review  and confirmation  of response  assessment.  These  materials  must  be sent to MSK 
promptly  upon  request.  
 
 
16.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM) Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  were  
approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the new 
policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy of the National  Cancer  Institute  for 
Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were

Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: 
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  safety  and 
quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  
compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on clinical  
research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional  
committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.  The 
committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and 
the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the Cente r‟s 
Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its level 
of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house  
sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) Will be addressed  and the 
monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
 
 
16.2.1  Department  of Defense  Monitoring  
 
A. Per Department  of Defense  Instruction  (DoDI)  3216.02,  a Research  Monitor  is required  for 
the current  protocol.   [CONTACT_245422]  has been  appointed  as the independent  research  
monitor  with expertise  consonant  with the nature  of risk(s)  identified  within  the research  
protocol.  
Research  monitor  functions  include:  
 
* observing  recruitment  and enrollment  procedures  and the consent  process  for individuals,  
groups  or units,  
* overseeing  study  interventions  and interactions,  
* reviewing  monitoring  plans  and UPI[INVESTIGATOR_245344];  
* overseeing  data matching,  data collection,  and analysis  
However,  at a minimum,  the research  monitor:  
* may discuss  the research  protocol  with the investigators,  interview  human  subjects,  and 
consult  with others  outside  of the study  about  the research;  
* shall have authority  to stop a research  protocol  in progress,  remove  individual  human  
subjects  from a research  protocol,  and take whatever  steps  are necessary  to protect  the 
safety  and well-being  of human  subjects  until the IRB can assess  the monitor's  report;  
* shall have the responsibility  to promptly  report  their observations  and findings  to the IRB 
or other  designated  official  and the HRPO.

16.3.[ADDRESS_298537] by [CONTACT_245414]/PB.  Protocol  amendments  that affect  MSK only (e.g. change  in MSK Co- 
Investigator,  MSK translation,  etc.) do not require  IRB review  at the participating  site(s).  All other  
protocol  amendments  will be immediately  distributed  to each  participating  site upon  receipt  of MSK 
IRB/PB  approval.  
 
Each  participating  site must  obtain  IRB approval  for all amendments  within  45 calendar  days of MSK 
IRB/PB  approval.  If the amendment  is the result  of a safety  issue  or makes  eligibility  criteria  more  
restrictive,  participating  sites will not be permitted  to continue  enrolling  new participants  until the site 
IRB approval  of the revised  protocol  documents  is granted  and submitted  to MSK.

event  do not require  reporting  to the MSK IRB/PB.   However,  they must  be clearly  documented  in 
the patient ‟s medical  record.  
 
Prospective  Deviations  
 
Deviations  to the research  protocol  that involve  an informed  consent  procedure  change  and/or  
treatment/pharmacy  alterations  that are not allowed  by [CONTACT_245415]/PB  prior to the change  being  carried  out. Participating  sites should  contact  [CONTACT_245416] [INVESTIGATOR_245345]/PB.  Deviations  to the research  protocol  
that involve  patient  eligibility  will not be permitted.  
 
Retrospective  Deviations  
 
Deviations  that include  a change  or departure  from the research  protocol  without  prior approval  from 
the MSK IRB/PB  are considered  retrospective  deviations.  Retrospective  deviations  should  be 
reported  to the MSK PI [INVESTIGATOR_87953],  who will in turn report  the deviation  to the MSK IRB/PB  
as per MSK guidelines.  
 
Participating  Site IRB Reporting  
Participating  sites should  report  all deviations  to their institution ‟s IRB per local guidelines.  
Approvals/acknowledgments  from the participating  site IRB for protocol  deviations  should  be 
submitted  to MSK upon  receipt.  
 
Other  correspondence  
Participating  sites should  submit  all other  correspondences  to their institution ‟s IRB according  to 
local guidelines,  and submit  copi[INVESTIGATOR_245346],  including  approvals  and 
acknowledgements,  to MSK.  
 
 
16.3.3  Document  maintenance  
 
The MSK PI [INVESTIGATOR_245347].  
The participating  sites will ensure  that all regulatory  documents  and participating  site IRB 
correspondence  are maintained  in an on-site regulatory  binder  and sent to MSK as outlined  within  
this protocol.  The on-site regulatory  binder  will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_245417].  A regulatory  binder  for each  participating  site will also be maintained  at MSK within  
the institution ‟s Protocol  Information  Management  System  (PI[INVESTIGATOR_46427]).  
 
After study  closure,  the participating  sites must  maintain  all source  documents,  study  related  
documents  and eCRFs  for 7 years.  
16.4 Noncompliance  
 
If a participating  site is noncompliant  with the protocol  document,  accrual  privileges  may be 
suspended  and/or  contract  payments  may be withheld  until the outstanding  issues  have been  
resolved.  
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 11 -166 A(14)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_298539]  the study  
participant.  The financial  costs  of the study  will be discussed;  afatinib  will be provided  free of charge.  
Biopsy  cost may be covered  by [CONTACT_102] ‟s insurance  if it is required  for confirmation  of metastatic  
disease,  if not covered  will be covered  by [CONTACT_209871].  The cost of pharmacokinetic  studies  will 
be covered  by [CONTACT_209871].  The patient  will be responsible  for the cost of standard  medical  care 
and all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],  even  for complications  of treatment.  Afatinib  will be provided  to the patient  
without  charge.  Correlative  tests  will be performed  without  charge  to the patient.  
 
No incentives  will be offered  to patients/subjects  to participate  in this study  
 
 
Inclusion  of women  and minorities  
MSKCC  has filed forms  HHS 441 (civil rights),  HHS 641 (handicapped  individual),  HHS 639-A (sex 
discrimination) and HHS 680 (age discrimination); we also take due notice of the NIH/ADAMHA 
policy  concerning  inclusion  of women  and minorities  in clinical  research  populations.  Patients  of all 
races,  both males  and female,  will be enrolled  into the protocol.  In the [LOCATION_001] metropolitan  area,  
there  is a high proportion  of minority  patients  (e.g.,  African -American,  Hispanic).  In general,  about  
15% of patients  at MSKCC  are members  of minority  ethnic  groups.  We will actively  try to recruit  
minority  patients  to this protocol.  
 
 
Exclusion  of children  and lactating  or pregnant  women  
Children  are excluded  from this protocol  because  there  is insufficient  data to determine  the safety  of 
afatinib  in children.  In addition,  the incidence  of esophagogastric  cancer  in children  is limited  and 
because  the majority  are already  accessed  by a nationwide  pediatric  cancer  research  network.  This 
statement  is based  on exclusion  4b of the NIH Policy and Guidelines  on the Inclusion  of Children  as 
Participants  in Research  Involving  Human  Subjects.  Similarly,  lactating  and pregnant  women  are 
excluded  because  of the potential  teratogenicity  and embryotoxicity  of afatinib.  
 
 
 
Future  Unspecified  Use of Correlatives:  
 
The protocol  includes  an informed  consent  document  and research  authorization  that meets  
statutory  guidelines.  They  inform  patients  of the purpose  of the bank,  their rights  in relation  to it, and 
the safeguards  in place  to protect  the confidentiality  of their health  information.  The consent  will 
state  that MSKCC  will save some  of the biospecimens  to use for future  research.  
 
Type  of futur e use 
The consent  specifically  describes  the types  of future  research  that may be performed,  including  use 
of tissues  to develop  new drugs  with cancer -associated  molecular  targets,  development  of cell lines,  
future  use of cell lines to define  cancer  phenotype  and (somatic)  genotype,  DNA  sequence  analysis  
of tumor  compared  to normal  and identification  of tumor -associated  proteins  as diagnostic  or 
prognostic  markers.  It will be stated  that researchers  at MSKCC  may either  keep indefinitely  or 
dispose  of any leftover  blood  or tissues  or other  samples,  including  DNA that the samples  contain.  
Blood  and tissues  will be stored  with identifiers  in secure  tissue  or fluid banks.  It is stated  that the 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 11 -166 A(14)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_298540]  
Patients  are asked  in a series  of check  boxes  at the end of the consent  if 1) they permit  their 
biospecimen  samples  to be stored  and used  in future  research  to learn  about  or prevent  cancer  or 
side effects  of treatment,  or to develop  new treatments;  2) if they permit  their samples  to be stored  
and used  in future  research  to learn  about,  prevent,  or treat diseases  other  than cancer;  or 3) if they 
permit  their samples,  with personal  identifiers  protected,  to be used  for research  about  inherited  
genetic  factors,  4) if they permit  their samples  to be used  for genetic  analysis  of the tumor  and 
normal  tissue  to learn  about  the causes  of cancer,  5) participants  are asked  if they agree  to be 
contact[CONTACT_245418] 6) if they consent  to be contact[CONTACT_245419].  Finally,  if not available  (e.g. deceased),  then if 
they wish to have their designee  designated  on the consent  to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
 
Participants  will not be provided  with specific  results  of research  tests performed  on their collected  
human  biologic  specimens.  
 
Voluntariness  of research  participation  
It is stated  that taking  part in this tissue  and blood  bank is voluntary  and patients  have the right to 
withdraw  at any time.  Participation  in the study  will not impact  on the clinical  care patients  receive.  
Participants  may decide  at a later date that they do not want identified  blood  and tissue  samples  to 
be stored  in the tissue  bank  and /or used  for future  research.  If participants  decide  to withdraw  from 
the study,  specimens  that have not yet left the specimen  archive  will not be used  in new studies  and 
any remaining  portions  of samples  that have not been  used  for research  will be used  only for clinical  
purposes  or, if requested  by [CONTACT_102],  destroyed.  For specimens  already  shipped  out from the 
archive,  it may not be possible  to locate  the samples  or stop already  ongoing  research.  
 
Risks  of research  participation  
The greatest  risk is release  of information  from health  or research  records  in a way that violates  
privacy  rights.  MSKCC  will protect  records  so that name,  address,  phone  number,  and any other  
information  that identifies  the participant  will be kept private.  It will be stated  to the participant  that 
the chance  that this information  will be given  to an unauthorized  individual  without  the participant ‟s 
permission  is very small.  
 
Costs/compensation  
There  is no cost to the participant  to enroll  in this research.  Tissue  or blood  obtained  in this research  
may be used  to make  a cell line, and these  may be patented  or licensed  and thus may have 
significant  commercial  value.  The participant  is informed  that there  are no plans  to provide  financial  
compensation  for use of their human  biologic  specimens,  nor are there  plans  for the participant  to 
receive  money  for any new products,  tests,  and discoveries  that might  come  from this research.  
 
Biospecimen  Privacy  
Medical  information  is confidential.  The participant ‟s personal  identity  will not be used  in reports  that 
are written  about  the research.  The MSKCC  IRB/PB  will review  all requests  for research  performed  
involving  biospecimens  ascertained  through  this protocol.  Blood  and tissue  samples  may be stored  
with a code  linked  to the patient ‟s medical  record.  The results  of any research  using  blood  or tissues  
will not be placed  in the medical  record.  
 
The consent  also indicates  that samples  and genetic  information  collected  may be shared  with other  
qualified  researchers.  Such  information  will not include  identifying  information  such  as name.  It is

also stated  in the consent  and Research  Authorization  that research  data (e.g. genomic  sequence)  
may be placed  into databases  monitored  by [CONTACT_154108],  and may be made  
accessible  to investigators  approved  by [CONTACT_941] U.S. government.  The requirements  for submission  of 
genotype/phenotype  data into the NIH GWAS  Repository  (or any other  public  database)  will be 
outlined  in the biospecimen  analysis  application,  i.e. IRB Biospecimen  Protocol.  
 
17.2 Privacy  
MSKCC ‟s Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by [CONTACT_11097]  [INVESTIGATOR_40092]  (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is 
required  for 30-days after the participant ‟s last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  
treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 „Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events ‟, the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:  
Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to [EMAIL_440] .  All other  
reports  should  be sent to [EMAIL_2141] .

For each  adverse  event,  the investigator  will provide  the onset  date,  end date,  intensity,  treatment  
required,  outcome,  seriousness,  and action  taken  with the investigational  drug.  The investigator  will 
determine  the relationship  and expectedness  with the investigational  drug to all AEs as defined  in 
the listed  adverse  event  section  of Boehringer  Ingelheim „s (BI‟s) Investigator  Brochure  for the 
Product.  
The investigator  does not need  to actively  monitor  patients  for adverse  events  once  the 
clinical  trial has ended.  However,  if the investigator  becomes  aware  of an SAE(s)  that 
occurred  after the patient  has completed  the clinical  trial (including  any protocol -specified  
follow -up period),  it should  be reported  to BI if the investigator  considers  it relevant  to the BI 
study  drug.  
 
 
 
 
17.3.2  SAE Reporting  for Participating  Sites  
 
Responsibilities  of Participating  Sites  
• Participating  sites are responsible  for reporting  all SAEs  to their site IRB per local

17.5 Unanticipated  Problems  
 
Unanticipated  problems  involving  risks to participants  or others  (UPs)  are defined  as any 
incident,  experience  or outcome  that meets  all of the following  criteria:  
• Unanticipated  (in terms  of nature,  severity,  or frequency)  given  (a) the research  procedures  
that are described  in the protocol -related  documents,  such as the IRB-approved  research  
protocol  and informed  consent  document;  and (b) the characteristics  of the subject  
population  being  studied;  and 
• Related  or possibly  related  to participating  in the research  (possibly  related  means  there  is a 
reasonable  probability  that the incident,  experience  or outcome  may have been  caused  by 
[CONTACT_211143]);  and 
• Suggests  that the research  place  participants  or others  at a greater  risk of harm  (including  
physical,  psychological,  economic,  or social  harm)  than was previously  known  or recognized.  
 
Participating  sites are responsible  for reporting  all UPs to MSK  as soon  as possible  but within  
3 calendar  days of learning  of the event.  UPs that are SAEs  should  be reported  to MSK via 
SAE Report  form as per section  17.2.  All other  UPs should  be reported  to MSK in a memo  
signed  by [CONTACT_7880]. 
 
MSK is responsible  for submitting  UPs to the MSK IRB/PB  according  to institutional  
guidelines.  In addition,  MSK is responsible  for notifying  participating  sites of all non-SAE UPs 
that may affect  the sites.

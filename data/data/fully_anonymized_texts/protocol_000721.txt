 [ADDRESS_216716] Activity (LILA), a.k.a. A Randomized 
Controlled Trial of a Group -Based Therapeutic Yoga Intervention for Urinary 
Incontinence in Ambulatory Older Women  
 
Objectives  
To evaluate the efficacy of a  group- based yoga intervention  for urinary incontinence 
in ambulatory  middle -aged and older women a nd explore potential m ediators of 
intervention effects in this population.  
Study Design  
Randomized,  multicenter, parallel -group trial of a 12- week yoga intervention versus 
non-specific muscle stretching/strengthening control intervention for ambulatory 
women aged [ADDRESS_216717] once per day, are not participating in 
other organized yoga or muscle stretching/strengthening activities, are temporarily 
willing to forgo other es tablished clinical treatments for incontinence, and meet 
minimum mobility and other clinical  eligibility criteria , recruited from multiple locations 
in northern [LOCATION_004] .   
Interventions and Duration  
Participants will  be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to participate in either a 12- week yoga 
program (N~ 120) or a time -equivalent non-specific muscle stretching/strengthening 
control program (N~ 120).  Women randomized to the yoga  program will take part in 
twice weekly group yoga classes focusing on Iyengar /alignment -based yoga 
techniques and practice yoga at home for at least one hour per week for 12 w eeks.  
Women randomized to the control program  will take part in twice weekly gr oup 
classes focusing on non -specific muscle stretching/strengthening exercises  and 
practice these exercises at least one hour per week at home for 12 weeks.   
Study Outcomes  
The primary outcome is change in the frequency of any urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s between baseline and 12 weeks, measured using  validated voiding diaries. 
Secondary outcomes include changes in the frequency of stress -type, urgency -type, 
daytime, and night time incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  (also measured by [CONTACT_183514]), as 
well as changes in incontinence -related functioning or quality of life  (measured by 
[CONTACT_80845]) , between baseline and  12 weeks. Additional secondary 
outcomes include persistence of changes in incontinence frequency and condition-
specific quality of l ife 12 and 24 weeks after the end of the intervention programs .

  1. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 
Objective  1: To determine the efficacy of a  group- based yoga intervention in reducing the 
frequency of urinary incontinence in ambulatory midlife  and older women.  
Hypothes is 1A: Ambulatory incontinent women  randomized  to the yoga intervention will 
demonstrate at least a 20% greater  decrease in total incontinence frequency (measured by 
[CONTACT_183515] d iaries) over  12 weeks , compared to women randomized to the control 
intervention .  
Hypothesis 1 B: If improvements in total incontinence frequency are observed at 12 weeks, 
these improvements will be sustained  12 and 24 weeks after the end of  the intervention 
programs.  
Objective 2 : To determine the efficacy of a gro up-based yoga intervention in reducing the 
frequency of type - and context -specific urinary incontinence in ambulatory middle -aged and 
older women.  
Hypothesis 2A : Ambulatory incontinent women randomized  to the yoga intervention will 
report  decreases in the frequency of  stress -type, urgency -type, daytime, and nighttime 
incontinence (also measured by [CONTACT_183514]) over 12 weeks , compared to women 
randomized to the control intervention.   
Hypothesis 2B : If improvements in  stress -type, urgency -type, daytime, and nightime 
incontinence frequency  are observed at 12 weeks, these improvements will be sustained  12 
and 24 weeks after the end of  the intervention programs . 
Objective 3: To determine the efficacy of the yoga intervention in improving incontinence -
related functioning and quality -of-life.  
Hypothesis 3A: Ambulatory incontinent women  randomized to the yoga intervention will 
report greater improvements in condition -specific functioning and quality of life ( assessed by 
[CONTACT_80845]) over 12 weeks , compared to women randomized to the control 
intervention .  
Hypothesis 3B : Compared to  women randomized to  the control intervention, we hypothesize 
that women randomized to the yoga intervention will report sustained improvements  in 
condition -specific quality of life 12 and 24 weeks after the end of the intervention programs . 
Objective 4:  To explore whether the yoga intervention is associated with improvements in 
1) pelvic floor  muscle strength, 2) peripheral autonomic function, and/or 3) lower extremity 
physical function, and assess whether improvements in these factors may mediate 
improvement in incontinence.  
Hypothesis 4A: Among ambulatory incontinent women enrolled in this trial, the yoga 
intervention  will be associated with improvements  in a) pelvic floor  muscle strength 
(assessed by [CONTACT_183516]), b) cardiac autonomic function (assessed by [CONTACT_183517]), and c) lower extremity physical function ( assessed by 
[CONTACT_183518] ) over 12 weeks.  
Hypothesis 4B: Among ambulatory incontinent women enrolled in this trial, changes in 
incontinence  frequency  over 12 weeks will be partly mediated by [CONTACT_10486] a) pelvic floor 
muscle  strength , b) cardiac autonomic function , and c) lower extremity physical function . 
 [ADDRESS_216718] costs of incontinence among U.S. women exceed $[ADDRESS_216719]- line treatment for incontinence includes behavioral management 
strategies such as bladder re -training  and pelvic floor exercises designed to increase 
bladder capacity, strengthen the pelvic floor muscles supporting the bladder, and 
suppress inv oluntary bladder contractions. Unfortunately, many patients who attempt 
to practice these techniques after routine teaching by [CONTACT_183519] .10-13  Although the efficacy of these techniques can be improved by 
[CONTACT_31806]-on-one training and biofeedback with pelvic physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_183462], this type of intensive pelvic floor rehabilitation 
therapy is costly, and access to trained pelvic physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_183463] .14,15   
Second -line treatment for urgency -type incontinence (i.e.,  urine leakage caused by 
[CONTACT_183520]) consists primarily of anticholinergic drugs that are 
modestly effective in reducing incontinence, but have multiple side effects such as dry mouth, stomach upset, constipation, and even cognitive impairment.  As a result, over 
half of patients who initiate anticholinergic therapy  for urinary symptoms  like 
incontinence discontinue it within a year .
16-18  For stress- type incontinence (i.e., urine 
leakage with activities that increase abdominal pressure), surgery and other invasive 
procedures can be effective, but are poorly tolerated by [CONTACT_183521], particularly 
older or frailer women who are at greatest risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_183464] .[ADDRESS_216720] the potential to improve resting autonomic function as well as stress -
related autonomic reactivity ,26-29 which could in turn lead to improved bladder control.  
Regular practice of yoga postures can also improve physical deconditioning as another 
 11 of 54  
  potential contributor to incontinence risk.5,30-33 Among frail older women, decreased 
physical cond itioning and mobility  can compromise women’s ability to get to the 
bathroom when they experience urges to urinate. Poor physical conditioning is also 
associated with increased abdominal obesity, which has been shown to contribute  to 
both stress - and urgency -type incontinence  symptoms . Several small studies have 
explored the benefits of physical exercise programs for preventing or managing 
incontinence in older women34,35; unlike yoga, however , these non -specific exercise  
programs did not have the added benefit of engaging the pelvic floor or directly improving autonomic balance  in incontinent women . 
To examine the feasibility of using yoga to treat incontinence in middle -aged and older 
women, our research team  previously  developed a group- based, Iyengar- style yoga 
program consisting of twice weekly classes and once weekly home practice sessions. 
We subsequently pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]- tested and refined that program through an initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_183465] [ADDRESS_216721] University.   Eligible women will be randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to participate in either a 12-week yoga program (N~ 120) or a time- equivalent, non-
specific muscle stretching and strengthening contro l program (N~ 120).  
Women randomized to the yoga program will take part in twice weekly group yoga classes 
involving an expected [ADDRESS_216722] one hour per week for a total of 12 weeks.  Women 
randomized to the muscle stretching and strengthening (a.k.a physical conditioning)  control 
group will take part in twice weekly group physical conditioning classes and practice 
physical conditioning exercises at least one hour per week at home for [ADDRESS_216723] icing yoga or stretching /strengthening  exercises for at least two hours  per 
week. 
To address objective  1, we will use validated voiding diaries to examine changes in 
frequency of  total incontinence during the 12- week intervention , as well as explore 
persistence of effects on incontinence frequency after the end of the intervention programs.

4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Recruitment :  Participants will be recruited from multiple locations in northern 
[LOCATION_004]  using a multi -component approach that has been employed successfully in 
past clinical t rials led by [CONTACT_473]. This includes  community -based media 
efforts (newspaper a nd radio advertisement s, mass community mailings, notices 
posted in community and senior ce nters), recruitment from a database of women 
who have given permission to be contact[CONTACT_183522]’s health research  studies 
based at the University of [LOCATION_004] San Francisco  (UCSF)  or Stanford University, 
recruitment of current and/or former female patients at UCSF or Stanford University 
identified through searches of electronic clinical databases, and posting or display of 
recruitment fliers in clinician offices (such as general internal medicine , geriatrics, 
gynecology, or alternative medicine).  Recruitment will be organized in waves to 
assemble successive cohorts of women who are confirmed to meet all eligibility 
criteria and who are available to attend  upcoming group yoga or muscle 
stretching/strengthening  classes.   
 14 of 54  
  Screening : Preliminary eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_183523] 
a Screening Telephone I nterview followed by [CONTACT_28920] -person Screening C linic Visit.  
During the Screening Telephone Interview, c oordinators will follow a standardized 
screening interview script to assess preliminary  eligibility  related to age, gender, 
incontinence history, and exclusionary conditions and medications , as well as 
document reasons for ineligibili ty on the screening interview form . Candidates who 
appear preliminar ily eligible at the end of the telephone interview will be scheduled to 
attend an in -person Screening Clinic V isit. After providing written informed consent at 
this visit, women will under go more detailed assessment of incontinence symptoms, 
use of clinical incontinence therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], exclusionary medical conditions, exc lusionary 
medications, urine di pstick and pregnancy testing (for women of childbearing 
potential), and brief physical mobility  assessment , with reasons for eligibility or 
ineligibility documented on the screening clinic intake form.   
At the end of the Screening Clinic V isit, women who appear eligible will be given a 
blank voiding diary and instructions for completing it at home over a [ADDRESS_216727] 3 times over the 3- day diary period and meet all other 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  at the Baseline Clinic Visit  will be  considered eligible for 
randomization  to one of the two intervention groups . 
Randomization : During each recruitment/randomization wave, eligible women will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two intervention groups . Randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_183524] (i.e., stress, urgency, or mixed), to 
ensure adequacy of randomization within these three types. Randomization will be  
implemented by [CONTACT_183525] [ADDRESS_216728] allocation concealment procedures will be followed (see subsequent 
section on Randomization for more detail ).   
To avoid excessive lag time between randomization and the start of the therapeutic 
yoga or stretching/strengthening control  programs, randomization will take place no 
earlier than two weeks before the intervention program  orientation sessions . For 
candidates whose Baseline Clinic Visit  falls within this two -week window, 
randomization will take place directly  at the Baseline Clinic Visit . For candidates who 
complete their Baseline Clinic Visit  more than two weeks before the start of the yoga 
or control  intervention programs, a Randomization Telephone Call  will be scheduled 
to complete randomization  within the two -week window . 
5.  STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Yoga  Program   
Overview and rationale : The 12- week yoga program will provide instruction and 
practice in a variety of yoga postures and techniques  that have been selected for 
their potentia l to improve bladder control as well as their  safety and feasibil ity for the 
target population. The study yoga program will be  based primarily on Iyengar  yoga, a 
form of Hatha yoga that is known for its potential therapeutic applications, has been employed successfully in other studies of yoga for different indications ,
36-44 and 
differs from other Hatha yoga styles (power yoga, bikram yoga) in multiple ways that 
are likely to maximize both efficacy and safety for this study. Important features of 
 15 of 54  
  Iyengar/alignment -based yoga i nclude: 1) emphasis on precise anatomical and 
postural alignment during practice of postures; 2) incorporation of props to minimize 
risk of injury and accommodate those with lower strength or flexi bility; 3) emphasis 
on mindful awareness during practice of postures rather than r apid cycling through 
postures.  
The study yoga  program, which was pre- tested and refined in the investigators’ prior 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602],  is designed to maximize women’s awareness of and control over the 
pelvic floor and improve underlying autonomic balance and physical conditioning, 
while still being feasible for ambulatory women across a wide range of ages, as well 
as grounded in techniques common to Iyengar yoga at large.   
Content and postures : The yoga progra m will focus on a core set of 16  postures that 
are widely used in yoga practice and can be safely adapted for ambulatory women 
across a range of ages, including those with mildly or moderately decr eased 
flexibility or mobility. These include both active postures engaging the pelvic floor 
and more passive postures promoting relaxation: Baddha Konasana (bounded angle 
pose), Malasana (squat pose), Bharadvajasana (seated twist pose), Supta  Baddha 
Konasana (reclined cobbler’s pose), Parsvottasana (intense side stretch pose), 
Salabhasana (locust pose), Savasana (corpse pose), Salamba Set Bandhasana 
(supported bridge pose), Parsvokonasana (side angle pose), Utkatasana (chair 
pose), Trikonasana (triangle pose), Vajrasana (thunderbolt), Virabhadrasana 2 
(warrior 2 pose), Tadasana (mountain pose), Supta Padagushthasana (reclining big toe pose), and Viparita Karani Variation (legs up the wall pose) . 
Staff qualifications and training: Each yoga class series will be led by a primary 
instructor who  must : 1) have at least 2 years of experience teaching yoga  in the 
community; 2) review a detailed, study- specific written instructor  manual describing 
all of the postures and yoga techniques to  be used in the study program; 3) complete 
at least 2  hours of in-person training in study- specific yoga techniques with one of 
the study yoga expert consultants ; 4) complete additional  study -specific training in  
clinical trial procedures,  documentation of  participant attendance, review of home 
practice logs, and recording of yoga postures practice d during group classes on 
appropriate study forms; 5 ) carry  and submit proof of personal liability insurance 
(minimu m of $2 million coverage); and 6 ) confirm  his or her willingness  to adhere to 
the study intervention procedures . For each class series, a back -up instructor will 
also be identified who can teach a class in the event that the primary instructor is ill 
or is unable to teach due to an emergency.  
Orientation and classes :  Prior to group instruction, participants in each class series 
will attend a 90 -minute group orientation led by [CONTACT_183526] . This 
will include an overview of the general principles of Iyengar /alignment  yoga, an 
orientation to the structures of the pelvis, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and lower extremity, and an 
introduction to the postures to be practiced  and the props to be used in the study. 
After the orientation, women will attend 90 -minute group classes twice weekly for 12 
weeks, led by [CONTACT_183527] . For classes with 10 or more students, the 
instructor may  be supported by [CONTACT_183528]. During group classes with no more than 15  participants, the 
instructor will guide women in practicing yoga postures, calling attention to ways in 
which postures can improve pelvic floor function and adapt postures to 
accommodate physical limitations. Women will also be taught to avoid habits that 
may worsen incontinence durin g practice, such as squeezing of abdomin al rather 
than pelvic muscles. Following a study -specific guide, instructors will gradually 
 16 of 54  
  introduce postures as classes progress, with the goal of making participants 
comfortable  with all core postures by [CONTACT_5638] 6  weeks and fully confident in 
performing postures by 12 weeks. During the COVID -19 pandemic, class instruction 
may be converted to remote platforms  (i.e., may take the form of interactive  on-line 
video- based classes rather than in -person classes) . 
Home practice : In addition to attending group classes, participants will be asked to 
practice yoga at home at least one additional hour  per week and will be given a diary 
to keep track of the dates and times of practice.  Women will also be given a written  
manual, pre -tested in the investigators’ pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602],  that includes pi[INVESTIGATOR_183470] . Each participant 
will be given a limited set of yoga props (a mat, belt, and 2 blocks) for home practice.  
Women will be encouraged to practice with other members of their classes, but will 
be discouraged from practicing with individuals who are not in their class and from 
taking part in non -study yoga activities that might dilute study techniques.   
Quality an d safety : The study program will incorporate multiple modifications to help 
women across the age range to perform postures in ways that minimize ri sk of 
muscle strain or injury. Participant manuals will include specific instructions on 
adapting each postur e and/or using props to accommodate problems with mobility, 
flexibility, or balance. To promote quality and safety, the instructors leading classes 
will be required to have at least [ADDRESS_216729] 
completed dedicated, study -specific training with the study’s expert consultants. 
Following procedures established in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], a consultant will visit at least one 
class in each series to ensure that postures are being taught according to protocol, evaluate students’ success i n learning yoga, and ensure fidelity across instructors.  
Twice m onthly conference calls will be conducted to help instructors trouble- shoot 
issues that arise in instruction.  
Post- intervention program continuation : After the end of the main [ADDRESS_216730] two hours per week at home, although group intervention classes will no longer 
be offered through the study .  
5.2 Muscle Stretching/Strengthening ( i.e., Physical Conditioning)  Control Program  
Overview and rationale : This trial will include a 12 -week non-specific muscle 
stretching/strengthening  program that will provide a rigorous time -and-attention 
control for the yoga program, but  has been designed to avoid engaging the pelvic 
floor or promoting mindful relaxation. To minimize differential expectations of 
treatment success, women will be told that they are enrolling in a study of two 
different types of low-impact physical activity- based interventions (yoga versus 
physical conditioning ) to enhan ce management of incont inence. Control group  
exercises have been adapted from exercises used in prior studies conducted by [CONTACT_4520], such as the PRYSMS trial of restorative yoga vs. stretching for metabolic syndrome (designed by [CONTACT_183529], DPT, consultant on this 
proposal), and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested in the investigators’ prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_183471] .  Similar to postures in the yoga 
program, the exercises in the stretching/strengthening  program have been selected 
for their potential to be performed safely by [CONTACT_183530] a range of ages and 
flexibility levels. 
Content and exercises :  After a brief education about sitting and standing posture, 
 17 of 54  
  the control intervention  program will focus on a core set of muscle stretching  and 
strengthening  exercises that will be performed sitting in a chair: levator scapulae, 
upper trapezius, scalenes, shoulder horizontal adduction, triceps, pectoral stretch 
with hands behind head, wrist flexors and extensors, trunk flexion, trunk extension,  
trunk side -bend, trunk rotation, and hamstring stretches.  Additional chair exercises 
will incorporate a stretching strap: pectoral stretch with strap, gastrocnemius stretch 
with strap, and hand behind back with strap.  A few stretches will be performed o n an 
exercise mat on the floor: supi[INVESTIGATOR_183472], supi[INVESTIGATOR_183473], quadriceps stretch with strap, supi[INVESTIGATOR_183474] , and 
seated adductor stretch. Several exercises will be performed in the standing p osition: 
gastrocnemius, soleus, shoulder flexion, and shoulder abduction stretches. 
Staff qualifications and training : Each stretching/strengthening  class series will be led 
by a primary instructor who : 1) is  either certified as a personal trainer through the 
National Academy of Sports Medicine , National Strength and Conditioning 
Association,  or the American College of Sports Medicine, or National Strength and 
Conditioning Association (NSCA), or licensed as a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_183475]; 2) has at least [ADDRESS_216731] or physical trainer in either individual or group settings; 3) will have  
reviewed a detailed, study- specific training manu al describing all of the 
stretching/strengthening exercises to  be used in the study program; 4 ) will have  
complete d at least 2 hours of in -person training in study- specific techniques with 
study e xpert consultant ; 5) will have  completed additional  study -specific training in 
clinical trial procedures, documentation of participant attendance, review of home 
practice logs (for adherence), and recording of exercises performed  during group 
classes on appropriate study forms; 6) carries  and submit s proof of perso nal liability 
insurance (minimum of $2 million coverage);  7) confirm s his or her willingness to 
adhere to the study intervention procedures. For each class series, a back -up 
instructor will also be identified who can teach a class in the event that the primary 
instructor is ill or is unable to teach due to an emergency.  
Group orientation and classes: Similar to the yoga program, the 
stretching/strengthening control  program will begin with a group orientation led by a 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] /trainer, who will provide an overview of the 
stretching /strengthening  exercises to be cove red in the program. This will be 
followed by [ADDRESS_216732]/trainer , who will have received in -person 
study -specific training from a study expert physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_183476] . Classes will 
be designed to make women comfortable with all exercises by 6 weeks and fully 
confident in performing exercises by 12 weeks.  During the COVID -19 pandemic, 
classes may be coverted to remote platforms (i.e., may take the form of intera ctive 
on-line video -based classes rather than in -person classes) . 
Home practice : In addition to attending group classes, women will be asked to 
perform stretching /strengthening  exercises at home at least one additional hour  per 
week and record the dates and times of practice in a log. Women will receive a detailed manual with pi[INVESTIGATOR_183477]/strengthening  
exercise to guide them in home practice, as w ell as a stretch strap and exercise mat 
to use at home . 
Quality and safety :  Instructors leading physical conditioning  classes will be physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_183478] [ADDRESS_216733]. Pawlowsky will provide quality monitoring and assess 
women’s success in learning stretching /strengthening  exercises by [CONTACT_183531]-
person visit to at least one class in each series. She  will also lead twice monthly 
conference calls with instructors, similar to quality monitoring for the yoga program.   
Post- intervention program continuation : After the end of the main 12 -week 
intervention period, participants will be encouraged to continue  practice 
stretching/strengthening exercises at least two hours per week at home, although 
group intervention classes will no longer be offered through the study.  
5.[ADDRESS_216734] expected concomitant use of 
these techniques with yoga in clinical practice.  However, participants will be 
discouraged  from pursuing more formal training  or coaching in behaviora l 
incontinence treatment strategies from pelvic floor physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_183479] (see 
prohibited interventions below).  
5.3.[ADDRESS_216735] incontinence (anti cholinergic 
bladder medications, tricyclic  antidepressants, m irabegron ), invasive or 
surgical bladder treatments, nerve stimulation therapy, medical devices used 
to improve bladder symptoms (e.g., pessary), and behavioral treatment 
programs administered by [CONTACT_183532] (e.g., pelvic fl oor 
rehabilitation therapy, bio feedback programs).  
Participants will be queried about use of these treatments  at baseline, at the 
6-week and [ADDRESS_216736] -intervention follow- up periods, 
participants will also be encouraged to avoid using other clinical treatments 
for incontinence, and instead focus on continued home practice of study yoga 
or muscle stretching/strengthening exercises to manage their symptoms.  
Participants will be queried about use of these treatments  at the [ADDRESS_216737] depression or anxiety symptoms 
(e.g., antidepressants, sedatives/hypnotics, or antipsychotic agents)  during 
the 12- week intervention period  or 12-  or 24- week post -intervention follow -up 
period, although maintenance of stable do sages of these medications will be 
acceptable.  
5.[ADDRESS_216738] any 
participant who misses a scheduled class to ask about reasons for missing the class , 
reinforce the importance of class attendance,  and troubleshoot any barriers to 
attendance.  
Adherence to home practice  of yoga or stretching/strengthening exercises  will be 
tracked using home practice logs . Participants will be instructed to record the date, 
time, and du ration of each home practice session  in their logs , as well as the specific 
yoga poses or stretching/strengthening exercises practiced during each session.  
Home practice logs will be returned to the clinical coordinators on a weekly  basis 
during the 12- week intervention programs . Clinical coordinators will contact [CONTACT_183533] /strengthening  exercises at least  one hour a week at home. Additionally, 
home practice logs will b e returned [ADDRESS_216739] -intervention  follow -up period.  
Every effort will be made to encourage participants to complete  all intervention  
classes and practice sessions. Prior to randomization , study coordinators will stress 
the importance of adherence  to group classes and home practice, and only those 
women who indi cate that they are available on scheduled class dates and willing to 
practice yoga or stretching /strengtheni ng exercises at home as recommended  will be 
eligible for randomization. The importance of adherence will again be stressed at the 
orientation sessions  for each intervention class  series, as well as during follow -up 
telephone calls at 2 weeks and a follow -up visit at 6  weeks . Additionally, a ttendance 
sheets from  yoga and stretching /strengthening  classes will be carefully monitored,  
and home practice logs will be reviewed weekly , so that study staff can immediately  
call any women who miss classes or fail to d ocument home practice in order to 
reinforce the importance of attendance/practice and troubleshoot barriers to 
adherence.

  6.  STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Study Measure s 
6.1.1  Urinary I ncontinence 
The primary efficacy outcome, frequency  of any urinary incontinence, will be 
assessed using a 3- day voiding diary that has been shown to be a valid and 
reliable method for documenting change in incontinence symptoms and is 
widely used in clinical trials of incontinence treatments .46,47  At 
screening/baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 12 - and 24-  weeks after the end 
of the yoga and control intervention  programs (i.e., 24 and 36 weeks ), each 
participant  will receive written instructions and a blank diary to take home , and 
will use the diary to record all voiding and incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_17767] a 3 -day 
period and classify incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_183480] (urgency, stress, 
other). Upon return of the diary , an analyst will abstract data to determine the 
number of total as well as urgency and stress incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_914]. 
For diaries that are completed after  randomization, data  will be abstracted by 
[CONTACT_183534] . 
6.1.2  Incontinence- Related  Quality of L ife  
To address incontinence -related quality of life, participants will complete the 
following validated questionnaire measures at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 
weeks, as well as 12  and 24 weeks after the end of the yoga and 
stretching/strengthening control  programs: 
A. Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ) -- a validated, 28- item measure of 
the impact of incontinence on 4 domains of functioning and quality of life 
(physical activity, emotional hea lth, relationships, and travel) .48,49 Scores 
range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate worse impact.  
B.  Urogenital Distress Inventory -6 (UDI -6)-- a validated, 6- item measure that 
assesses subjective distress from frequent urination, urgency 
incon tinence, stress incontinence, small -volume leakage, difficulty 
emptying the bladder, and genital pain.49 Scores are scaled from 0 to 100.  
C. Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) -- a validated single -item 
measure assessing the degree to which respondents consider their 
condition to be a problem on a 6 -point scale.50,51 
D.  Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire, IUGA -Revised 
(PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -IR)- a validated 20- item measure of sexual function in women with 
pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), designed  to be appropriate for both sexually 
active and inactive women.52 
6.1.3  Depression, Anxiety,  and Perceived Stress  
To evaluate depression, anxiety,  and perceived stress symptoms that may be 
associated with incontinence, participants will complete the following validated 
questionnaire measures at screening/baseline , 6 weeks, and 12 weeks, as 
well as 12  and 24 weeks after the end of t he yoga and control intervention  
programs: A. Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CES -D): Depressive 
symptoms will be assessed  by [CONTACT_150216]- D, a 20- item measure that has 
been w idely used in clinical trials, including bladder interventions, and is 
sensitive to change .
53 Total scores range from 0 to 60.  
 21 of 54  
  B. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_183481] (STAI) : Somatic anxiety (i.e., the 
affective component of anxiety believed to be related to autonomic 
physiological arousal response)  will be mea sured using the trait 
component of the STAI , a 20- item self -administered measure validated in 
clinical populations, including patients with bladder symptoms, with scores 
ranging form 20 to 80 .54,55 
C. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) : Cognitive anxiety (i.e., the 
mental component of anxiety associated with fear of failure)  will be 
measured by [CONTACT_183535], a validated self -administered questionnaire that 
includes a 7 -item Anxiety Subscale56 shown to be sensitive to change in 
incontinence trials .57 Scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores 
indicating greater anxiety.  
D. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) : Perceived stress will be assessed by [CONTACT_183536],  a 10- item measure of thoughts and feelings related to perceived 
stress in the past month, validated in  a probability sample of the United 
States.58 Scores range from 0 to  40; higher scores indicated greater 
stress. 
6.1.4  Yoga/ Physical Conditioning Self-efficacy  and Competency  
A. Yoga Posture Self -Efficacy: After randomization , 6 weeks , and 12 weeks, 
women in the yoga group will complete a structured questionnaire 
(modeled after an existing self -efficacy measure 59 and pre- tested in the 
investigators’ previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]) to indicate  how confident they are that 
they can perform each of the postures featured in the program ( from ‘not at 
all’ to ‘extremely confident’). A corresponding questionnaire will be 
administered to the muscle stretching/strengthening control  group 
participants.  
B. Independent Yoga Competency Assessment: To provide a more objective 
assessment of women’s  success in learning  yoga, a  yoga expert 
consultant will attend one class at the end of each series and observe 
women as they practice yoga. The  consultant will rate each woman’s 
success in performing each yoga posture on a 5 -point scale, ranging from 
“not at all” to “extreme ly” successful. In the muscle 
stretching/strengthening control group, a study expert physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_183482].  
C. Yoga Practice Adherence Self -Efficacy: After randomization , 6 weeks and  
12 weeks, as well 12  and 24 weeks after the end of the intervention 
programs, women will complete a measure of confidence  in adhering to 
yoga or stretching practice , modeled after existing physical activity 
adherence self -efficacy scales 60 and tested in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Women will  
indicate o n a 5- point scale how confident they are that they can practice 
yoga or stretching when they: 1) are tired, 2) a re in a bad mood, 3) have 
limited time, 4) are away from home, and 5) are not regularly attending yoga classes . Scores will range from 0 to 20.  
D. Credibility and Expectations of Treatment: To assess whether women perceive the yoga and physical conditioning  interventions as equally 
credible and have similar exp ectations for improvement in incontinence, 
we will administer a modified version of an expectancy/credibility measure used in other women’s health studies at baseline .

  6.1.5  Physical Function/Performance M easures  
To guide exploration of changes in physical function/ conditioning as a 
potential mediator of intervention effects in women with incontinence, 
participants will complete the following assessments at baseline , 6 weeks,  and 
12 weeks :  
A. PROMIS Adult Physical Function Profile short -form: This self-adminis tered 
questionnaire  measure of perceived physical function assesses functioning 
of the  upper extremities, lower extremities, a nd central regions (neck, back), 
and has previously been validated  across age and race -ethnicity groups.62   
B. Balance testing: Participants will be asked to undergo successive semi-
tandem, tandem, and one -legged balance stand tests, in which their ability 
to hold each position for up to 30 seconds will be assessed.63,64  
C. 30-second chair stand: Participants will be asked  to stand up from a 
standard chair to a  fully extended standing position as many times as 
possible  within [ADDRESS_216740] : In this test of aerobic endurance  for older adults,69,[ADDRESS_216741]. Higher scores indicating greater fitness. 
6.1.6  Cardiac Autonomic Function M easures  
To guide  exploration of changes in autonomic nervous system function as a 
potential mediator of intervention effects in women with incontinence, 
participants will undergo the following measures  at baseline and 12 weeks. 
During the COVID -19 pandemic, participants may decline to undergo these 
measurements that require them to  come into close proximity (less than 6 foot 
distance) with study personnel.  
 
A. High frequency heart rate variability (a.k.a. respi[INVESTIGATOR_25570], or 
RSA) refers to the degree to which heart rate accelerates  and decelerates 
during the respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126], and has been shown to be a reliable marker 
of cardiac parasympathetic activity.71-[ADDRESS_216742] protocols from the 
North American Society of Pacing & Electrophysiology,80 in which two 
ECG electrodes will be attached to each participant’s right and left wrists using pre- gelled sensors while in the seated position. Following an initial 
10-minute “resting” recording, a 10 -minute “stress” rec ording will be 
obtained while the participant completes two stress tasks, including a 
visual attention and tracking task
[ADDRESS_216743] -to-stress change in RSA.  
B. Systolic pre -ejection period (i.e., PEP, the time period between the left 
ventricle contracting and the aortic valve opening ) will be examined as an 
established m easure of sympathetic activity that can be measured non -
invasively using impedance cardiography.72,[ADDRESS_216744] tetrapolar band electrode system will be attached to each 
participant while in the seated position (two inner electrodes placed at the 
xiphisternal joint and the base of the neck, outer electrodes placed 3 cm 
distally to the inner electrodes) and connected to the impedance 
cardiograph module.  Impedance cardiogram recordings will be obtained 
over the same time interval as RSA recordings, including a resting period 
and a stress period. This will include a computer -based stress task 
designed by [CONTACT_3252]- investigator [CONTACT_183583] to assess sympathetic reactivity,[ADDRESS_216745]-to-stress change in PEP.  
6.1.7  Pelvic Floor Muscle Strength  
To guide exploration of changes in pelvic floor muscle strength  as a potential 
mediator of intervention effects in women with incontinence, participants will 
be invited to undergo the following optional assessment of pelvic floor muscle 
strength  at baseline and 12 weeks. For this assessment, a clinically -trained 
assessor  (doctor, nurse, or pelvic floor physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541])  will perform a digital 
pelvic exam and ask the participant to squeeze her pelvic floor muscles during exam. The assessor will then rate pelvic muscle strength using the Brink 
scale, which includes 4 -point scales in 3 categories— contraction pressure, 
displacemen t of the examiner’s fingers, and duration of squeeze — to create 
an overall score of [ADDRESS_216746] a relative contraindication to pelvic exam or anticipate 
pain with pelvic exam can decl ine to undergo this measurement. During the 
COVID- 19 pandemic, participants may also decline to undergo these 
measurements that require the m to come into close proximity (less than 6 foot 
distance) with study personnel. For assessments performed after 
randomization, the assessor will be blinded to intervention assignment.  
 
At the Stanford clinical site, p articipants will also be invited to undergo 
perineometer assessment of pelvic floor muscle strength by a board -certified 
urogynecologist  at the same timepoints (baseline and 12 weeks). Participants 
will be asked to contract their pelvic floor muscles, and contraction strength will be measured with a Laborie Urostym digital perineometer. This device is 
currently used clinically  and approved for pelvic floor physical therapy and 
biofeedback. Measurements obtained by [CONTACT_183537] -rater and test -retest reliability. Measurements will 
include minimum, maximum, and average strength of each pelvic floor muscle contraction measured. Duration of contraction will also be recorded. A total of three contractions will be measured by [CONTACT_183538]. Measureme nts 
 24 of 54  
  will be recorded in cm H2O or mm Hg. Each patient will be assigned a vaginal 
sensor that will be processed according to manufacturer’s recommendation 
and used for the baseline and follow -up exams. Since this is an optional 
assessment, participants who have a relative contraindication to pelvic exam 
or anticipate pain with pelvic exam can decline to undergo this measurement. 
 
6.1.8  Additional Screening and Covariate M easures  
The following  data will be collected to assess eligibility, assess whether  
treatment groups are comp arable at baseline, and guide statis tical adjustments 
in the event groups are not balanced:  
A. Demographic history including date of birth, gender/sex identity , 
race/ethnicity, education history, employment history, marital status 
(screening/baseline)  
B. Urologic /urogynecologic history including age of onset of incontinence, past 
and current treatment of inco ntinence, history of pelvic surgery, history of 
pregnancy and delivery, menstrual/menopausal status , sexual activity 
status  (screening/baseline)  
C. General m edical history including general health assessed by [CONTACT_183539] ,91 selected medical conditions  associated with 
incontinence such as diabetes, tobacco and alcohol use, and physical 
activity level  (screening)   
D. Current medication use  (screening/baseline and 12 weeks)  
E. Health -related habits such as tobacco/alcohol use (screening) ; fluid and 
caffeine intake using the fluid intake amount and fluid intake behavior 
sections of the Questionnaire -Based Voiding Diary92-94 (baseline, [ADDRESS_216747] -interventio n); prior yoga experience, 
prior group -based physical activity instruction  (screening) , physical activity 
level by [CONTACT_183540]95,96 (screening)  
F. Sleep function assessed using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]  (PSQI),97,[ADDRESS_216748] studies of older adults99-101 
(baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks, as well as 12 and 24 weeks after the end of 
intervention programs ). 
G. Physical exam measures including measured height, weight, heart rate, and 
blood pressure (screening/baseline  and 12 weeks)  
6.[ADDRESS_216749] explain the study procedures to the potential 
participant, referring as necessary to the detailed IRB -approved consent 
form. The coordinator will then give a copy of the consent form to the 
potential participant to rea d. After the potential participant has read the 
consent form, she will be asked if she has any questions or concerns about 
the study. Once these questions/concerns have been addressed, the 
participant will be asked to sign the consent form, and will be given a copy of 
the consent form to take home for future reference.  
Pursuant to [LOCATION_004] Health & Safety Code [ZIP_CODE], each participant will also 
receive a copy of the Experimental Subject's Bill of Rights.   
6.2.3   Screening  Procedures  
Telephone Screening  Interview 
• Women  who call in response to recruitment advertisements or who have 
previously given permission to be contact[CONTACT_183541]’s health research at UCSF  will be provided with a 
brief overview of the study goals and procedures by a clinical coordinator 
over the telephone. 
• If interested, candidates will complete a brief telephone survey to assess 
preliminary eligibility ( including age, gender, duration/frequency/type of 
incontinence, current and past incontinence treat ment, prior yoga and 
muscle strengthening exercise  practice, physical mobility, exclusionary 
conditions and medications, availability for upcoming group intervention 
classes) . 
 
Screening Clinic Visit  
• At this visit, a clinical coordinator will explain the requirements of the study 
while referring to the detailed informed consent form, and candidates will 
provide written informed consent if they are still interested in proceeding 
with the study.  
• Candidates will complete questionnaires about  their demographic, 
urologic/urogynecologic , and medical history to det ermine if they meet 
criteria related to  age, gender, duration/frequency/type of incontinence, 
current and past incontinence treatment, prior yoga and muscle 
strengthening exercise  pract ice, exclusionary conditions , and medications 
• Over -the-counter and prescription medications will be reviewed to 
determine if candidates are taking any exclusionary medications.  
 26 of 54  
  • Height, weight, and resting blood pressure and pulse measurements will 
be obtai ned. 
• Basic p hysical mobility including ability to rise from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_183483] . 
• A clean -catch urine sample will be collected to assess for possible urinary 
tract infection and rule out pregnancy (for  candidates who are  still of child -
bearing potential).   
• Potentially eligible women will be instructed on completing a 3 -day voiding 
diary to document all incontinence and voiding epi[INVESTIGATOR_83252].  
• A Baseline Clinic Visit  will be scheduled at least 3 days later for review of  
the completed voiding diary and determination of final eligibility.  
 
Baseline Clinic Visit

reviewed by a clinical coordinator. Candidates whose diaries indicate 
predominantly urgency, stress, or mixed -type incontinence, document at 
least 3 incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 3-day diary, and meet all other eligibility 
criteria will be eligible to continue.    
• Women will complete structured questionnaires about depression and 
anxiety, incont inence -specific quality of life , and sleep quality .   
• Physical function will be assessed by  [CONTACT_183542] . 
• Cardiac autonomic function will be assessed through heart rate variability and impedance cardiography measurements.  
• Participants will be invited to undergo pelvic fl oor muscle strength 
assessments involving a digital pelvic exam (and/or perineometer 
assessment if the visit is at the Stanford site) . The assessment may be 
performed directly during the Baseline Visit, or an alternate clinic 
assessment may be scheduled specifically for this exam.  
• Participants will be given a brief written pamphlet about usual first -line 
behavioral management of incontinence (see description in interventions section above).  
• If the Baseline Clinic Visit takes place within [ADDRESS_216750] 
intervention program  session, eligible participants  will be randomized to 
one of the two interventions at this visit.  
• If the Baseline Clinic Visit takes place more than [ADDRESS_216751] 
intervention  program  session, eligible participants will be scheduled for a 
Randomization Telephone Call within two weeks of the start of the 
program to determine their interventio n assignment.  
6.2.4 Randomization and Blinding  
Randomization  
Women who are confirmed to be eligible and available to take part in 
upcoming group intervention  class series will be randomized i n a 1:[ADDRESS_216752] within 2 weeks of the sta rt 
of the relevant group intervention  class series. If the Baseline Clinic Visit 
occurs within 2 weeks of the start of the intervention  program, eligible 
 27 of 54  
  participants will be randomized to one of the two interventions directly at this 
visit. If the Baseline Clinic Visit occurs more than 2 weeks before the start of 
the intervention program , eligible participants will be scheduled for a 
Randomization Telephone Call within two weeks of the start of the program to determine their intervention assignment. 
During  the Baseline Clinic visit or during the Randomization Telephone Call 
(whichever is appropriate) , randomization will be performed according to a 
pre-established  computer- algorithm using randomly permuted blocks of sizes 
2, and 4.  Randomization will be s tratified by [CONTACT_183524] (i.e., 
stress -predominant , urgency -predominant ) to ensure adequacy of 
randomization among women with each major incontinence type. Prior to 
randomization, the research coordinator will complete a randomization 
checklist confirming that the participant m eets all eligibility criteria. 
Additionally, participants’ availability and willingness to attend upcoming yoga or control group classes will be re -confirmed before randomization 
assignment is obtained.  
Standard allocation concealment procedures will be followed  to avoid 
manipulation of randomization .
[ADDRESS_216753] the next 
numbered envelope corresponding to the par ticipants’ type of incontinence  to 
determine gro up assignment. Once a participant has been randomized, she 
cannot be re -assigned to a different intervention group. All randomization 
envelopes will be retained for review; randomization dates and times should 
follow the order of the sequence numbers, providing a check on validity.  
After randomization, participants will complete self -efficacy questionnaires 
specific to their assigned intervention (yoga or stretching/strengthening).  
Blinding  
Although participants cannot be blinded to intervention  assignment (due to 
the beha vioral nature of the intervention s), study procedures have been 
carefully designed to avoid bias associated with knowledge of group assignment.  First, to minimize differential expectations of treatment success, 
participants will be told that they are participating in a study of  two different 
types of low -impact group activity- based interventions to enhance self -
management of incontinence, and that we do not know which is more 
effective (which is true ). The primary out come will be assessed by [CONTACT_183543], a measure that is resistant to reporting bias, and data  from returned 
diaries will be abstracte d by [CONTACT_183544]. Similarly, data from  participant  
follow -up questionnaires assessing other symptom and quality- of-life 
outcomes associated with in continence will be abstracted by [CONTACT_183545].   
Only study personnel who are involved in delivering the therapeutic 
interventions, assessing and promoting adherence to these interventions, 
 28 of 54  
  and/or monitoring adverse events related to these intervention s will be aware 
of group assignment. All i nvestigators, study analysts involved in abstracting 
efficacy outcomes data, and statistical programmers  involved in ongoing data 
cleaning will be blinded to treatment allocation. Unless stipulated by [CONTACT_183546] a 
participant experiencing a serious adverse event, these investigators and 
staff will remain blinded  until after all participants have completed the 12-
week clinic visit , trial data from the 12- week visit  are edited and cleaned, and 
the trial dataset  for the 12 -week intervention period  is locked.      
6.2.5 Follow- up/Final Evaluations

6.2.6 Early Termination (also see section below)  
If a participant indicates that she needs or wishes to discontinue all 
participation in the study, then she will be encouraged  to complete an Early 
Termination visit. This visit will include as many of the procedures originally 
scheduled to take place at the 12 -Week Clinic Visit as possible, including: 
assessment of adverse events; re -administration of questionnaires about 
condit ion-specific quality of life, depression and anxiety symptoms, and yoga 
or stretching/strengthening self- efficacy; review of current medications; re -
assessment of weight, blood pressure, and heart rate; re -assessment of 
physical function, autonomic function, and pelvic floor strength; and administration of a study satisfaction questionnaire. The participant’s reasons for terminating participation early will be explored and documented in her file.  
Of note, a participant can discontinue participation in study  intervention 
classes or intervention home practice without discontinuing participation in the overall study. When possible, participants who decide to stop attending or 
engaging in the study intervention programs  will be asked to provide data at 
originall y planned outcome assessment timepoints (e.g., at 12 weeks and at  
12 and 24 weeks after the originally plann ed end of the intervention  program ).  
In this case, no early termination visit will be performed, but planned outcome 
assessment visits will be comp leted.

 [ADDRESS_216759] participants at substantial 
risk of harm,  study procedures may be associated with the following risks:  
• Yoga Intervention :  Possible risks associated with group yoga instruction and 
home yoga practice include muscle soreness and muscle/ligament strain, or 
other musculoskeletal injury if participants fall or lose their balance while trying to 
practice yoga poses.  
• Stretching/Strengthening Control Intervention :  Similar to the yoga intervention, 
possible risks associated with the stretching/strengthening control intervention include muscle s oreness and muscle/ligament strain, or musculoskeletal injury if 
participants fall or lose their balance while trying to learn or practice the stretching  or strengthening  exercises.  
• Behavioral Incontinence Self -Management Pamphlet :  Provision of standard 
written information on usual first -line behavioral self -management strategies for 
incontinence such as pelvic floor muscle exercises and timed urination should 
not pose any risks to participants, although participants may find it inconvenient 
or unpleasant to read the pamphlet.  
• Questionnaires and Diaries : Although the information participants provide on 
data collection forms and diaries is confidential, some participants may feel embarrassed at having to answer questions, especially those related to urinary 
symptoms, depression, anxiety, or sexual function . There will be slight 
inconvenience in time and effort to complete diaries and questionnaires.  
• Physical Exam Measurements :  There are no direct risks associated with 
undergoing measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, or heart rate, 
although participants may experience this as inconvenient or unpleasant.  
• Digital Pelvic Examination : Digital pelvic examination (not requiring a speculum) 
and assessment of pelvic floor muscle strength may be associated with 
discomfort or soreness in the perineal or vaginal area, emotional reaction to 
being touched in the genital area, feeling of fullness or pressure in the rectum, or 
urge to urinate during or following the exam.  
• Perineometer Assessment : Similar to digital pelvic exam, p erineometer 
assessments of pelvic floor muscle strength  (at the Stanford site only0  may be 
associated with discomfort or soreness in the perineal or vaginal area, emotional 
reaction to being touched in the genital area, feeling o f fullness or pressure in the 
rectum, or urge to urinate during or following the exam.  
• Urinalysis and Urine Pregnancy Testing : There are no direct risks associated 
with collection of the clean -catch urine sample, although some participants may 
experience t his as inconvenient or unpleasant.  
• Heart Rate Variability and Impedance Cardiography :  Heart rate variability and 
impedance cardiography will be obtained using a non -invasive Biopac electronic 
monitoring system.  The only adverse effect that may result fro m these 
measurements is mild skin irritation at the site of the ECG or cardiac impedance 
 34 of 54  
  electrodes, which should disappear within 24 hours of removing the electrodes.  
Although noninvasive, measurement of heart rate variability and pre -ejection 
period may be experienced by [CONTACT_80833].  
To minimize potential risks to participants associated with study interventions and 
procedures, the following steps will be taken:  
• Yoga Intervention :  The instructors leading the group y oga classes will be 
trained yoga teachers who will have experience in teaching adults from a wide 
range of ages to learn and practice yoga safely and will undergo specific, in -
person training by [CONTACT_1758]’s yoga expert consultants.  The study protocol incorporates yoga props such as blocks and blankets to help participants 
perform yoga postures in such a way that will minimize the likelihood of muscle strain or musculoskeletal injury.  The yoga instruction manuals and audio 
recordings are designed to includ e explicit tips on modifying or adapting 
postures to accommodate problems with mobility, flexibility, or balance. 
• Stretching/Strengthening Intervention :  Instruction for the control intervention 
classes will be provided by [CONTACT_183551][INVESTIGATOR_183484], and who will have completed in -person training with co- investigator 
Sarah Pawlowsky, PT. Stretching and strengthening exercises have been 
selected to  be appropriate for middle -aged and older women who may have 
flexibility or mobility limitations in addition to incontinence.  
• Behavioral Incontinence Self -Management Pamphlet :  The pamphlet used in 
this trial has previously been administered and refined in  other large -scale 
research studies. Study coordinators will be available to answer participants’ 
questions about the pamphlet if they arise.  
• Questionnaires and Diaries : Any paper -based questionnaires or diaries 
collected in this research will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a locked room 
in research facilities, and data obtained from diaries and questionnaires will be 
stored on password -secured servers. All study staff are fully trained in good 
clinical practice and Human Subject Projections  procedures, and the importance 
of participant confidentiality will be emphasized.  
• Physical Examination Measures:   Study coordinators who are responsible for 
obtaining physical exam measures will have prior clinical experience with 
performing physical exam measurements in middle- aged and older women, and 
will receiving study -specific training to ensure that they perform measurements 
in a manner that is sensitive and minimizes dis comfort to participants.  
• Digital Pelvic Examination : Digital pelvic exams and assessment of pelvic floor 
muscle strength will be performed by [CONTACT_183552] -trained consultants who have 
experience performing pelvic exams for clinical care and are trained to pe rform 
exams in a manner that is sensitive and minimizes discomfort to participants. 
Participants will be informed that they can ask to stop the exam for any reason; 
they can also decline the pelvic exam but take part in other aspects of the study.  
• Perineom eter Assessment : Perineometer -based assessment of pelvic floor 
muscle strength (at the Stanford site only) will be performed by a board -certified 
urogynecologist with experience performing pelvic exams for clinical care, 
experience in perineometry measurem ents, and training in  perform ing exams in 
a manner that is sensitive and minimizes discomfort to participants . Participants 
 35 of 54  
  will be informed that they can ask to stop the assessment for any reason; they 
can also decline the pelvic exam but take part in oth er aspects of the study.  
• Urinalysis and Pregnancy Testing : Study coordinators who are responsible for 
performing urine testing will be trained to instruct participants on providing urine samples in a manner that is sensitive and minimizes embarrassment.  
• Heart Rate Variability and Impedance Cardiography:  Participants with a history 
of allergy or adverse reaction to ECG electrodes or adhesives may to forgo undergo heart rate variability or impedance cardiography measures.  If 
participants develop a skin reaction after testing is begun, measurements will be 
discontinued, and no further testing will be performed at any future visits.  
7.[ADDRESS_216760] following randomization , starting with 
the 2- Week Telephone Call . Additionally, participants will  be given telephone 
numbers to call study staff in between scheduled study visits or calls to report a ny 
significant health changes.  
Coordinators will not prompt participants to provide information about specific types 
of adverse events  at follow -up visits, but instead encourage  participants to volunteer 
information by [CONTACT_183553] , open- ended question, “Have there been any 
changes in your health since your last visit?”  Any negative changes in health reported by [CONTACT_183554], as 
appropriate (see below for definitions and documentation) . 
7.3     Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events     
7.3.1  AE/SAE Definitions   
An Adverse Event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in participant that 
occurs during the study or with use of the study interventions. An adverse finding can include a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment , or any 
combination of these. Medical conditions or diseases pr esent before starting 
study interventions will only be considered adverse events if they worsen 
after starting the intervention.  
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any AE that results in death, a life -
threatening event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183485], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or any other important medical event that jeopardizes 
the safety of participants based upon appropriate medical judgment.  
7.3.2  AE/SAE Documentation 
All negative changes in health reported by [CONTACT_183555] , as appropriate. Each adverse event will be 
assigned an AE number  and will be recorded on a separate AE form  to avoid 
duplication in reporting. For each AE, clinical  coordinators  will record the date 
of onset and resolution of the AE  and record the nature or type of AE.  In 
consultation with the principal investigator, c oordinators will also indicate 
whether any indicate whether any specific action  such as discontinuation of 
the study intervention was taken in response to the AE.   
 36 of 54  
  Using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
system, all adverse events will be graded in severity using the 5 -point CTCAE 
scale. According to this scale, AEs are considered grade 1 if they represent 
only mild symptoms or asymptomatic laboratory findings; grade 2 if they 
cause moderate symptoms that limit instrumental activities of daily living 
(shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], transportation, house hold tasks); grade 3 if they are serious or 
disabling events or result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183486] -threatening; grade 4 if they are life -threatening 
events in which the participant is at risk of death a t the time of the event if 
immediate intervention is not undertaken; or grade [ADDRESS_216761] the nature or type of 
SAE. Coordinators will also document any treatment provided for the SAE, 
indicate any laboratory or other clinical data obtained about the SAE,  indicate 
the participant’s con dition at the time of reporting of the SAE, and indicate 
whether any specific action such as study discontinuation was taken in 
response to the SAE. Each SAE form will be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_28824], who will use a standard attribution scale to indicate the 
potential relationship between any SAEs and study interventions  (not, 
unlikely, possible, probably, or definitely related to study intervention). 
7.4 Reporting Procedures 
  7.4.1   SAE Reporting 
• Clinical coordinator s will notify the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_183487] 
a SAE is discovered, in addition to filling out a standardized SAE form  
that will be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_458]  (see section 
above regarding SAE documentation) . 
• The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_183488], the 
independent Data and Safety Monitor  (DSM), a nd the NIDDK program 
officer  within 24 hours of awareness of the event.   
• Other unexpected serious adverse events that are potentially 
intervention -related will be reported by [CONTACT_458]  [INVESTIGATOR_183489], the DSM , and the NIDDK Program Officer within 48 hours of 
learning of the event.  
• Anticipated or unrelated SAE s will be handled in a less urgent manner but 
will also be reported to the UCSF IRB and the DSM within [ADDRESS_216762] quarterly to the NIDDK Program 
Officer.  Of note, no  SAEs that are directly related to the study procedures 
are currently anticipated.  
 
7.4.2   Non- Serious AE Reporting 
 
• If a clinical coordinator discovers an AE that does not meet the definition 
of a SAE but may still pose a substantial risk of harm to a pa rticipant and 
is potentially associated with study interventions or procedures, he/she 
 37 of 54  
  will report the AE to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 1 working day, in 
addition to filling out a standardized AE form. 
• Cumulative trends in all non-serious adverse ev ents will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_458]  [INVESTIGATOR_183490] (see 
below for DSM meeting schedule). More frequent cumulative review of 
non-serious adverse events may be performed if recommended by [CONTACT_183556] .  
• Although the UCSF IRB does not require reporting of non -serious AEs to 
the UCSF IRB, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_183491] -serious AEs if they may still pose a substantial 
risk of harm to a participant or are potentially associated with study 
interventions or procedures.   
7.5 Follow- up for AEs/SAEs 
From the time that they are first reported by  [CONTACT_183557], 
AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolved or considered stable. At each 
scheduled follow -up contact [CONTACT_183558], a clinical 
coordinator will assess whether the AE or SAE is continuing  or has resolved, and will 
update information about event status on the AE or SAE form, as appropriate. For 
SAEs, the clinical coordinator or principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_183492] (with 
their permission) in order to monitor resolution of SAEs.   
7.[ADDRESS_216763] of the study and safety of participants will be evaluated by [CONTACT_183559]  (DSM), who will be a  clinical researcher 
experienced with  designing, implementing, and monitoring safety in therapeutic 
interventions studies as well as a practicing clinician . The DSM  is independ ent of the 
investigators  and staff participating in the study,  and has no financial ties to the 
outcome of the study. The DSM will periodically review the conduct and outcomes of 
the study and provide feedback to the investigators, with particular attentio n to 
protecting the  safety of the participants.  
Prior to initiation of the trial, the DSM will review and approve the study design and 
plans for recruitment, adherence, interventions, data quality, and safety m onitoring.  
Approximately twice a year after r ecruitment begins, the DSM will evaluate the 
adequacy and timeliness of participant recruitment, adherence to the protocol, and 
the potential of the study to meet the stated goals ; evaluate the quality and integrity 
of the data, including adequacy of data management and data security procedures ; 
evaluate participant safety including trends in adverse events and relationship to the study procedures ; consider factors external to the study when relevant information, 
such as scientific developments, may have an  impact on the safety of the 
participants or the ethical conduct of the study; and make recommendations, if 
necessary, to the inves tigators and the NIDDK on continuation, termination, or other 
modifications of the study protocol.  
The DSM will periodically review aggregate  trial data according to the Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan  (DSMP) .  An emergency meeting may also be called by [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_183493].  Each 
review will include an assessment of the adequacy and timeliness of participant 
recruitment, adherence to the visit and  intervention protocols, data quality and 
 38 of 54  
  timeliness, adverse effects, and participant safety.  Interim reports for the DSM  will 
be prepared by a  biostatistician contracted by  [CONTACT_97607]’s Health Clinical Research 
Center, and sent to the DSM at least 5 days  prior to a pre -schedul ed meeting or 
conference call.  
After each interim review, the DSM will provide a signed statement that indicates 
whether the study should continue, terminate, or be altered based on ability to meet 
study recruitment and data quality goals and participant safety. He will include any 
recommendations for changes to the protocol if necessary to enhance participant 
safety or potentiate the ability of the trial to answer the research hypotheses.  This 
statement will be provided to t he principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_183494] t to the UCSF 
IRB and to the NIDDK program officer.  All materials, discussions, and proceedings 
of the DSM process will be completely confidential.    
8.   INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
Participation in the yoga and/or control  interventions may be discontinued if determined to 
be necessary to protect the safety of a participant.  The decision  to discontinue participation 
in therapeutic intervention s will be made on a case -by-case by [CONTACT_458], 
with i nput from the DSM  if needed.  Possible reasons for discontinuation of the therapeutic 
intervention may include: 1) development of a clinically significant adverse event limiting a 
participant’s ability to safety take part in yoga or stretching/strengthening  practice; 2) 
disruptive behavior exhibited by a participant  during intervention  classes or study visits that 
endangers the safety or comfort of other study participants, class inst ructors, or study staff; 
or 3) decision to terminate the study by [CONTACT_1201], NIDDK, or other regulatory b odies.  
Participants may also decide that they want to discontinue participation in interventions, 
even if study staff urge them to complete assigned 12 -week intervention programs.  
In the event that participation in yoga or control intervention  programs is discontinued, but 
the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_183495], feasible, and appropriate  for the 
participant  to continue to provide outcomes data, the participant will cont inue to be followed 
through 36 weeks (until the original expected  24-week post -intervention  assessment ) to 
collect outcomes data . If follow -up assessments are continued, n o modifications to the 
schedule of follow -up assessments will be made unless necessary to protect the safety of 
participants or to  accommodate limitations in function  resulting from  an adverse event.  
Follow -up assessments in participants who have discontinued the therapeutic interventions 
will not include continue d evaluation of adherence to group classes or home practice, 
assessment of yoga posture or practice adherence self -efficacy, or independent evaluation 
of participants’ success in performing yoga postures  or stretching/strengthening exercises . 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.[ADDRESS_216764] appropriate design for the  scientific goals of this research . Eligible 
participants will be randomly assigned in equal ratios to the yoga versus control 
interventions, with equivalent time and attention spent on study intervention and 
assessment procedures in both groups. 
A non-specific muscle stretching -strengthening  exercise program  has been selected 
as an active behavioral control intervention for this trial. Alt hough this control 
 39 of 54  
  intervention  may offer non-specific benefits for participants’ health, the investigators 
believe that it is unlikely to improve incontinence symptoms to the same extent as  
the yoga intervention . Inclusion of this plausible control  intervention will also 
minimize differential ex pectations of treatment benefit between participants in the two 
groups, thus promoting similar  adherence to interventions and visits in both groups . 
9.2 Sample Size  
Sample size has been  calculated based on parameter estimates  derived from both 
the investigators’  past pi[INVESTIGATOR_183496] -based 
incontinence intervention trials conducted by [CONTACT_38991].103 Assumptions 
include:  a) average baseline  frequency of incontinence of ~23-24 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]/week; b) 
standard deviation  (SD) of change in incontinence frequency of ~14.4; c ) correlation 
between outcome values of ~0.59; and d ) loss of ~15% by 3 months. Assuming a 
~50% decrease in incontinence frequency among controls (which is the threshold at 
which women with daily incontinence start to perceive meaningful  benefit from 
treatment18), the team will power the study to detect a between -group difference in 
reduction in incontinence of  at least 20 % in the yoga versus stretching/strengthening 
control group (corresponding to a ≥70% reduction in frequency of incontinence in the 
yoga group) at 3 months. Under these assumptions, a sample size of 240 (120 per 
group) will provide 80% power in 2 -sided tests with 5% type- I error to detect a 
between- group difference  in reduction in the primary outcome of total incontinence 
frequency  of at least 20 % in the yoga vs. control arm. With regard to  secondary 
outcomes, this sample will also provide 80% power to detect moderate between-
group differences of 0.26 to 0.39 SDs, assuming  intraclass correlation of outcomes in 
the range of 0.4- 0.8. 
9.3       Randomization and Blinding  
Randomization to the yoga or control intervention group will be performed by 
[CONTACT_183560], with proof of eligibility required before assignment.  
Randomization will be implemented using randomly permuted blocks of sizes 2 and 
4, and will also be stratified by [CONTACT_183561] (i.e., str ess-predominant , 
urgency- predominant ), to ensure adequacy of randomization within types. To avoid 
manipulation, standard allocation concealment procedures will be followed.[ADDRESS_216765] 
the next numbered envelope  to determine group assignment.  All envelopes will be 
retained for review; randomization dates and times should follow the order of the sequence numbers, providing a check on validity.   
Due to the behavioral nature of the intervention,  participants cannot be blinded to 
intervention  assignment , nor can study staff responsible for administering 
interventions or monitoring adherence to interventions. However , study investigators 
and staff members who are not involved in administering  interventions or monitor ing 
adherence to interventions will be blinded.  
Diary data  used to evaluate primary and secondary efficacy outcomes  will be 
abstracted by [CONTACT_183544]. Study- wide unblinding  for the [ADDRESS_216766] the safety of a participant.  
9.4     Interim A nalyses  and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_183497]/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_183498] : Since the trial involves low -
risk behavioral interventions that are of limited duration , the investigators believe that 
there is no scientific or ethical reason to stop the trial early or alter the trial design if 
treatment appears to be more effective than expected. Thus, as long as no safety 
issues arise, the trial will not be stopped or altered if the therapeutic intervention 
appears unexpectedly effective.  
Interim analys es and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_183499] : Although this study involves  low-impact  
behavioral interventions that are not expected to pose a significant risk to participant 
safety , consideration may be given to  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_183500]. These may take the form of SAEs  or non-serious 
AEs posing  a substantial safety risk and warranting  early termination of the trial . If 
evidence of adverse effects emerges, the investigators in consultation with the DSM 
may determine that these side effects are minor and the study can continue as 
planned, or may decide to alter or stop the study to prevent these side effects.  
Interim analyses and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589] : Consideration may be given to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_183501]. For example, consideration will be given to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_183502] i f recruitment 
falls more than 30% below planned rates and/or timely follow -up (i.e., completion of 
study visits within recommended windows) falls below 70%.
 
9.5 Outcomes  
9.5.1 Primary Efficacy O utcome   
The primary efficacy outcome will be change in the a verage frequency of any 
urinary incontinence over 12 weeks based on a validated 3- day voiding diary.  
To that end, frequency of incontinence  will be assessed based on voiding 
diaries completed at screening/baseline, 6  weeks, and 12 weeks . If 
improvement in incontinence is observed over 12 weeks, additional analyses 
may explore persistence of benefits  12 and 24 weeks after the completion of 
the yoga or stretching/strengthening  programs.   
9.5.2 Secondary Efficacy Outcom es   
Secondary efficacy outcomes will include change in the frequency of stress -
type, urgency -type, daytime, and nighttime incontinence, also assessed using 
validated voiding diaries, over 12 weeks. The total number of any, stress -
type, and urgency -type incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_183503].   
Other secondary efficacy outcomes will include change in q uality-of-life 
outcomes associated with incontinence  over 12 weeks.  To that end, changes 
 41 of 54  
  in depression and anxiety symptoms and incontinence -related quality of life 
will be assessed using validated questionnaires completed at 
screening/baseline, 6  weeks, and 12 weeks, as well as 12  and 24 weeks after 
the completion of yoga  or control programs.  
9.6 Data Analyses   
9.6.1    Analyses to address main objectives 
Objective  1: To determine the efficacy of a  group- based yoga intervention in 
reducing the fre quency of urinary incontinence in ambulatory midlife  and older 
women.  
Hypothesis 1A: Ambulatory incontinent women  randomized to the yoga intervention 
will demonstrate at least a 20% greater  decrease in total incontinence frequency 
(measured by [CONTACT_147889] v oiding diaries) over 12 weeks, compared to women 
randomized  to the control intervention.   
Hypothesis 1B: If improvements in total incontinence frequency are observed at 12 
weeks, these improvements will be sustained 12 and 24 weeks after the end of the 
intervention programs. 
Planned analyses : Intervention effects on the primary outcome of total incontinence 
frequency will be estimated using a linear mixed model (LMM) for changes since 
baseline in the overall frequency of any incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_183504] [ADDRESS_216767] 
capturing any linear trend across 6 and 12 weeks; this makes use of informati on for 
participants with [ADDRESS_216768] for linear trend across the three time points.    
 
Objective 2 : To determine the efficacy of a group -based yoga intervention in 
reducing the frequency of type - and context -specific urinary incontinence in 
ambulatory middle- aged and older women.  
Hypothesis 2A : Ambulatory incontinent women randomized to the yoga inter vention 
will report decreases in the frequency of stress -type, urgency -type, daytime, and 
nighttime incontinence (also measured by [CONTACT_183514]) over 12 weeks, compared 
to women randomized to the control intervention.  
Hypothesis 2B : If improvements in stress -type, urgency -type, daytime, and nightime 
incontinence frequency are observed at 12 weeks, these improvements will be 
sustained 12 and 24 weeks after the end of the intervention programs.  
Planned analyses : For additional confirmation of effects on t he primary outcome of 
total incontinence frequency, we will exa mine effects on frequency of urgency 
 42 of 54  
  incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_183505], again using the modeling 
approach indicated above. Additional models will explore effects on frequen cy of 
daytime and nighttime incontinence.  
 
Objective 3 : To determine the efficacy of the yoga intervention in improving 
incontinence -related functioning and quality -of-life.  
Hypothesis 3A : Ambulatory incontinent women  randomized to the yoga intervention 
will report greater improvements in condition -specific functioning and quality of life 
(assessed by [CONTACT_80845]) over 12 weeks, compared to  women 
randomized  to the control intervention.   
Hypothesis 3B : Compared to women randomized  to the control intervention, we 
hypothesize that women randomized to the yoga intervention will report sustained 
improvements in condition -specific quality of life 12 and 24 weeks after the end of the 
intervention programs.  
Planned  analyses : Additional LMMs will examine other secondary outcomes 
including incontinence -related quality of life as assessed by [CONTACT_183562] 
(i.e., the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ), Urogenital Distress Inventory 
(UDI), Patient Percept ion of Bladder Condition (PPBC), Pelvic Organ 
Prolapse/Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire, and IUGA -Revised (PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220]- IR) 
questionnaire),  as well as depression and anxiety symptoms assessed by [CONTACT_183563] (i.e., the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_183506] (CES -D), 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183507] (HADS), and State Trait Anxiety  Inventory 
(STAI) .  We will again estimate intention -to-treat intervention effects, adjusting for 
study location, using the same modeling strategy as for object ive 1 . Transformation 
or categorization of questionnaire scores (in combination with logistic or proportional 
odds models) will be considered as needed to deal with skewness of outcomes.     
Objective  4:  To explore whether the yoga intervention is associated with 
improvements in 1) pelvic floor muscle strength, 2) peripheral autonomic function, 
and/or 3) lower extremity physical function, and assess whether improvements in 
these factors may mediate improvement  in incontinence.  
Hypothesis 4 A: Among ambulatory incontinent women enrolled in this trial, the yoga 
intervention  will be associated with improvements  in a) pelvic floor muscle strength 
(assessed by [CONTACT_183516]), b) cardiac autonomic function (assessed by [CONTACT_183564]), and c) lower extremity physical function 
(assessed by [CONTACT_183518] ) over 12 weeks.  
Hypothesis 4B : Among ambulatory incontinent women enrolled in this trial, changes 
in incontinence  frequency over 12 weeks will be partly mediated by [CONTACT_10486] a) 
pelvic floor muscle strength , b) cardiac autonomic function , and c) lower extremity 
physical function . 
Planned analyses : Additional intermediary outcomes include pelvic floor muscle 
strength (me asured by [CONTACT_183565] ), peripheral autonomic function (reflected by 
[CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_25570] [RSA] and cardiac pre -ejection period [PEP] 
parameters), and lower extremity physical function (assessed using the Short 
Physical Performance Battery [SBBP] an d 2-minute step test ). Intervention effects 
will first be estimated using LMMs, using the same modeling strategy used for 
objectives 1- 3. Next, to assess for mediation of changes in incontinence  frequency  
by [CONTACT_183566], we will assess correlation between change s in these 
 43 of 54  
  parameters and change in incontinence frequency between baseline and 12 weeks . 
We will then examine attenuation of intervention effects estimates from the primary 
intention -to-treat analyses after adjustment for these potentia l mediators. Mediators 
will initially be analyzed as continuous variables (i.e., continuous change in RSA and PEP), but categorization will be considered in the event of skewed variable 
distributions. If evidence of mediation is observed, we will estimate 95% bias-
corrected percentile confidence intervals  confidence intervals for the proportion of 
intervention effect explained, using resampling by [CONTACT_183567]  
 
9.6.2    Other analytic issues  
Participant dropout (i.e., early termination or loss- to-follow -up) .  Participant d ropout 
levels are expected to be <15% at 12 weeks  of intervention, <20% at [ADDRESS_216769]-
intervention follow -up, and <25% at [ADDRESS_216770] -randomization variables associated with dropout. 
Alternately or in addition to this , we may  use multiple imputation of missing outcomes 
under plausible informative missingness assumptions.104 
Dose effects (length of exposure and intensity of practice) . In the event that the 
primary analysis shows that yoga intervention is effective in reducing incontinence 
frequency over [ADDRESS_216771] a statistically significant benefit over 12 weeks  an alpha of 
0.05, we may assess change from baseline to 6 weeks, and from 6 weeks to 12 
weeks , also at alpha of 0. 05, based on contrasts that can be obtained from the 
primary analysis model . In exploratory analyses, we may  also examine whether 
cumulative hours spent in group intervention classes (based on class attendance 
logs), or total hours of home yoga or stretching/strengthening practice (documented 
by [CONTACT_183568]’ home practice logs), are  associated with changes in incontinence 
frequency or secondary outcomes in each group .  After the end of the 12 -week 
intervention, additional explo ratory analyses may examine associations between 
continued yoga or control intervention practice (based on continued h ome practice 
hours)  and maintenance of intervention  effects. 
 
Exploratory subgroup analyses .  Intervention effects will be analyzed in sub groups in 
multivariate analysis based on a limited set of clinicopathologic factors that are 
hypothesized to have the potential to influence participants’ respo nse to the yoga 
and stretching/strengthening interventions. For example, we may explore whether 
baseline participant age,  race/ethnicity, clinical type of incontinence, pelvic floor 
muscle strength, or physical function levels influence subsequent treatment -
associated changes in primary and secondary outcomes. Subgroup -specific effects , 
estimated using the interaction model, will be presented only if the interaction 
between treatment and sub group is statistically significant at p<0.05.  
 
 44 of 54  
  During the COVID -19 pandemic, intervention instruction in some study waves may 
be converted to remote platforms (i.e., interactive  video- based class instruction 
rather than in -person class instruction) . In that event,  we will use the methods 
outlined above for exploratory subgroup analyses to evaluate differences in the effect 
of the intervention in waves that rely  primarily on video- based instruction rather than 
in-person instruction. 
   
Co-intervention effects . Because awareness of intervention assignment can affect 
use of co- interventions, women in both groups will be asked to refrain from using 
other clinical incontinence treatments during the study. Nevertheless, information 
about co- interventions will be collected at follow- up visits to permit assessment of 
potential effects of differential use of co -interventions on outcomes.  To estimate the 
direct effect of the intervention in the absence of co -interventions, we may conduct 
additional analyses to add co- intervention use, as well as confounders of its effect on 
the outcome, to the primary treatment model; if factors that are also affected by [CONTACT_42020]-interventions ar e among the confounders, we may  use inverse weighting rather 
than direc t adjustment for this purpose.  
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Collection Forms   
Study data will be obtained from participant -completed symptom diaries  and logs, 
participant - or interviewer -administered questionnaires, physical examinat ion and 
performance measures , and urine sampling /testing. Forms for recording or 
abstracting data will be developed specifically for this study, including:  
- Voiding diary abstraction form: After participants complete their voiding diary at 
home, they will return the comple ted diary to the study clinic, and d iary data will 
be abstracted using a Voiding Diary Abstraction Form. At the Baseline Visit, a clinical coordinator will abstract diary data for eligibility assessment purposes; at 
all post -randomiza tion follow -up assessments, an analyst who is blinded to 
intervention assignment will abstract diary data.  
- Questionnaires assessing  depression and anxiety, condition- specific quality of 
life, and participant satisfaction:  These questionnaire forms will be  completed by 
[CONTACT_183569] a clinical coordinator, 
or completed by [CONTACT_183570] . 
Participants may enter questionnaire responses directly into the electron ic study 
database using computer tablets  or electronic questionnaire links. If 
questionnaires assessing study efficacy outcomes are completed by [CONTACT_183571], then the staff 
member responsible fo r data entry will be blinded to intervention assignment . 
- Questionnaires assessing demographic history, general medical and 
urologic/ urogynecologic history, medication use, tobacco and alcohol use, and 
physical activity and function : These questionnaires wi ll be administered by a 
clinical coordinator during in- person study visits, and data from questionnaires 
will be entered by [CONTACT_183572].  Because these 
data will not be used to assess efficacy out comes, coordinators who admi nister 
and entering data from these forms will not necessarily be blinded to intervention 
assignment.  
 45 of 54  
  - Physical examination  and urine testing data forms: Clinical coordinator s will 
record the results of height and weight measurements, blood pressure and heart 
rate measurements, and urine dipstick and pregnancy testing on study -specific 
forms, and data from these forms will then be entered by [CONTACT_183573].  Because these data will not be used to assess any efficacy 
outcomes, the coordinators who are responsible for collecting, recording, and entering these data will not necessarily  be blinded to intervention assignment.  
10.2 Data Management   
Data will  be entered, managed, and edited using Medrio web- based Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) software for Clinical Research , which is available for use without 
charge for investigator -initiated, university - or government- sponsored research. 
Medrio software meets the requirements for electronic records and signatures (21 
CFR Part 11) and HIPAA. Data entered via Medrio can be accessed from machines 
on any network, can accommodate multiple users, allows for users at different sites to be issued differed password -protected logins, and includes tools to allow users to 
load data that collected offline.  
10.[ADDRESS_216772] 
cases will be training  offered by [CONTACT_183574] (CITI). CITI Human Subjects Research training includes specific 
modules on assessi ng risk to subjects, avoiding group harms, conflicts of 
interest, cultural competence, FDA -regulated research, HIPAA -regulated 
research, informed consent, IRB member responsibilities, IRB chair 
responsibilities, records -based research, research with vulnerable subjects, 
and unanticipated problems and reporting .  All investigators, project directors, 
and coordinators will maintain active CITI certification during the study.  
Coordinators and analysts involved in data collection will also attend a study -
specif ic training meeting led by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_183508].  At a minimum, the 
training meeting will include: (1) an introduction to the goals, design, and procedures of the LILA study; (2)  an overview of goals, structure, and 
procedures for administering and abstracting data from the voiding diary and 
other study -specific data collection measures; (3) a review of definitions and 
procedures for assessing, documenting, and reporting adverse e vents.   
Coordinators and analysts will also receive training and undergo supervised 
practice in reviewing and abstracting data from the voiding diary as the 
primary efficacy measure in the trial. They will also receive training and 
undergo supervised practice performing physical exam measures,  assessing 
physical function/performance, and obtaining autonomic function measurements .  Following the training, clinic al staff will be certified for 
performing these  functions.
 
 [ADDRESS_216773] data on the primary efficacy outcome (i.e., voiding diary abstraction 
forms) will be verified aga inst paper -based source forms by a staff member 
who was not originally involved in entering the data.  
 
Quality of data entry  will be periodically assessed using measures such as 
number of missing diaries/ forms and number of missing queries. The results 
of assessment of data quality will be incorporated into study progress reports 
for scheduled DSM meetings.  
10.3.3 Protocol  Deviations 
Exceptions or deviations from  the protocol are expected to  occur rarely or not 
at all  and, where possible,  will be approved in advance by [CONTACT_1961] . Protocol exceptions /deviations  may occur for the following 
reasons:  
• exceptions necessary to protect the safety or well -being of a participant 
(in this case, the protoco l exc eption should apply to that participant only)  
• deviations  due to oversight or error on the part of study staff , and 
subsequently detected by [CONTACT_183575] . 
 
For each protocol exception /deviation, study staff will document the event on 
a Protocol Deviations  Log (located in the Regulatory Binder). Entries in the 
Protocol Deviations  Log should include the participant ID, date of the 
deviation , the date the deviation is  recorded, description of the deviation , and 
action taken in response  to the deviation , if any. The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_183509], or 
acknowledgement for each deviation  detected after the fact.   
 
For this study, missed yoga or control intervention  classes will not be 
considered a protocol deviation, and neither will failure to complete recommended home practice sessions, although study staff will make every 
effort to promote adherence to classes and home practice  (see adherence 
section above ). 
10.3.[ADDRESS_216774] (IRB) Review   
The study protocol, informed consent docu ment, data and safety monitoring plan, 
and data collection forms will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_183576] . Any subsequent modificati ons to these 
documents will also be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_183577].  
11.2 Informed Consent Forms  
A signed consent form will be obtained from each participant  at the Screening Visit  
before in -person data collection procedures  are initiated (see section on informed 
consent procedures ). A copy of the consent form will be given to each participant, 
and documentation of signed consent will be filed in the participant’s study file . 
11.[ADDRESS_216775] access to the document linking study IDs to 
participant identifiers. Any paper source forms will be stored in locked cabinets in 
locked study offices , and only research personnel  who need to a ccess these forms 
for data collection, editing, or safety/quality monitoring will have access to them . 
Information that could identify individual participants will not be released without 
written permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1201], 
NIDDK, OHRP, or other agencies responsible fo r protecting participant safety .

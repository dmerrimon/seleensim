Exploratory objectives  
• To investigate the effects of variations in genes encoding for CYP enzymes and 
transporters on the potential drug -drug interaction profile of tazemetostat 
• To explore the effect of tazemetostat on overall survival (OS)  
Study design  Phase 1, open -label, 2-part, pharmacokinetic, safety, and activity study  
Methodology  This 2-part study is designed to characterize the drug -drug interaction (DDI) potential of 
tazemetostat.   Upon initiation of tazemetostat treatment, eligible subjects will receive 
tazemetostat BID continuously in [ADDRESS_11738] ration of 
the morni ng dose on Day 16 and Day 19.    
Upon initiation of tazemetostat treatment, all subjects enrolled in this study will receive oral tazemetostat  for up to 6 months (24 weeks) until they have an unacceptable toxicity, 
disease progression, or  withdraw consent.   Subjects continuing to receive benefit from 
tazemetostat treatment can be transi tioned to Study EZH -501 (a roll over study ) upon 
completion of Study EZH -105, at the investigator’s discretion, and after completing all 
study assessments and receiving at least [ADDRESS_11739] dose of tazemetostat.   Subjects who permanently discontinue treatment with 
tazemetostat and do not transition to the EZH -501 study, will be followed for OS.  
Number of subjects  Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled to achieve 12 subjects who complete each part 
of the study (total of 24 completed subjects).   Subjects will complete either Part A or Part 
B.

RECIST v1.1  for subjects with solid tumor s (Appendix  2).  
Exploratory endpoints  
• Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_12305]  
• Overall survival (OS)  
 
Statistical methods  Four  populations will be employed in the analyses of the study data:  
• The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who receive at least 
one dose of tazemetostat.   The ITT population will be used for summaries and 
analyses  of the efficacy en dpoints.  
• The Safety population  will consist of all subjects who receive at least one dose of IP 
who have at least one post  dose safety observation recorded.  The Safety population  
will be used for summaries and analys es of the safety and tolerability.  
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) population  will include all subjects in the Safety population 
who have sufficient post dose samples collected to allow estimation of the PK 
parameters.  The PK population will be used for PK summaries and analyses.  
• The Pharmacogenomic ( PGx) population will include all subjects in the PK 
population from whom PGx results are available.  The PGx population will be used 
for summary of PK parameters by [CONTACT_12358]. 
 
Log-transformed PK parameters will be analyzed by [CONTACT_12359] (ANOVA).   
The geometric least squares (adjusted) mean and  associated 90% confidence interval (CI) 
for the test treatment to reference treatment ratio of adjusted geometric means will be provided after transformation of t he results from the log -transformed analysis back to the 
original scale.  
Part A  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for plasma concentrations and PK parameters of 
tazemetostat and its metabolites and fluconazole.   To evaluate the effect of fluconazol e on 
the PK of tazemetostat, the ratio of adjusted geometric means and 90% CI for the test 
treatment (tazemetostat administered in combination with fluconazole) to the reference treatment (tazemetostat alone) for tazemetostat PK parameters will be calculat ed.  
   
Part B  
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -[ADDRESS_11762] of taze metostat on the PK of 
repaglinide and omeprazole, the ratio of adjusted geometric means and 90% CI for the test 
treatment (repaglinide administered with omeprazole and steady -state tazemetostat) to the 
reference treatment (repaglinide administered with omeprazole) for repaglinide and 
omeprazole PK  parameters will be calculated.   To evaluate the effect of increased gastric 
pH on the PK of tazemetostat, the ratio of adjusted geometric means and 90% CI for the 
test treatment (tazemetostat administered after 4 days of treatment with omeprazole) to the 
reference treatment (tazemetostat administered 1 hour before administration of repaglinide 
and omeprazole) for tazemetostat PK parameters will be calculated.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE)  will be summarized . Summaries of TEAEs 
will consist of the number and percentage of subjects reporting the AE by [CONTACT_12360] ( SOC ) and by [CONTACT_11702] .  TEAEs which occur more than once for a subject will 
be counted only once in the subject frequencies.   TEAEs with different CTCAE grades for 
a subject will be counted at the worst (highest) grade for the same SOC (likewise for preferred term ).  TEAEs with different drug relationship for a subject will be counted at 
strongest relationship for the same SOC (likewise for preferred term .  TEAEs with 
missing relationship to study treatment will be counted as “related”.
  TEAEs with missing 
CTCAE grade will be counted as Grade 3 (“severe”).  
TEAEs, SAEs , related TEAEs, related SAEs, ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_11763]-baseline visit.  
Physical examination, vital signs, ECG , and  ECOG performance status will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_12361].   
Response will be based on Lugano Classification ( Cheson 2014 ) for subjects with 
lymphoma,  or RECIST v1.1  for subjects with solid tumors.  ORR (CR or PR) will be 
summarized along with an exact 90% CI. DCR (CR  or PR, or SD lasting 24 weeks or 
longer since start of treatment) will be summarized similarly.  
OS will be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier method. If there are a sufficient number of 
deaths at the time of the analysis, median OS, first and third quartiles,  and 90% CI 
(Brookmeyer -Crowley method) will be summarized.

 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to [LOCATION_002] (US) and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP; Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Title 21 Part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization [ICH] guidelines), applicable government regulations, and i nstitutional research policies and 
procedures.  
2.1. Background 
Post-translational modifications of histones, the core proteins of chromatin, play an important 
role in controlling the fidelity of cellular gene transcription patterns.   One of the critical 
transcription -controlling histone modifications is methylation of specific lysine and arginine 
residues, catalyzed by [CONTACT_12362] (HMTs) which all use S -adenosyl methionine 
(SAM) as a c o-factor for the methylation reaction [ Copeland, 2013 ].  Genetic alterations in a 
number of HMTs or associated regulatory proteins have been identified in several human cancers 
where they are purported to be oncogenic.  Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of the multi-protein polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that catalyzes the mono -, 
di-, and trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) [ Margueron, 2011].   EZH2 mutation 
and/or over-expression has been observed in several cancer types, leading to an aberrant H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) state which is oncogenic [ Chase, 2011 ].  For instance, somatic gain 
of function mutations within EZH2, found within subsets of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), result in an oncogenic dependency on EZH2 production of abnormally high H3K27me3 levels, and resultant transcriptional reprogramming of the cell. [ Morin 2010] 
2.2. Lymphoma  
Somatic mutation s within the EZH2 gene on 3 hotspots  (Y64 6. A682, and A692 
[NM_001203247] ) are present in follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) and lead to high levels of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)  in these lymphomas. 
Those mutation s of EZH2 , therefore , have  been proposed to be required for the development and 
maintenance of the mutation -bearing lymphomas. Inhibition of EZH2 leads to reduction in 
H3K27 me3 and cell death in lymphoma cell lines bearing the mutation. In a ddition, loss of 
function of mixed lineage leukemia protein 2 ( MLL2 ) and histone acetyl transferases ( HATs ) 
may generate abnormal methylation states of H3K27, potentially leading to a dependency on EZH2. In nonclinical models, inhibition of EZH2 leads to reduction in H3K27 me3 in all 
lymphoma cell lines irrespective of their EZH2 mutation status. While cells with wild -type

Confidential  28 September 2018 
 
 EZH2 are growth inhibited with EZH2 inhibition in vitro, only mutant bearing cells undergo cell 
death in cultur e [Béguelin 2013; Knutson 2014] .  
Changes to the tumor microenvironment, for instance those affecting antitumor immunity, are increasingly recognized as an important mechanism in lymphomagenesis, affecting all types of NHL [Scott 2014] . Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12310] [ Wrangle 2013 ], and EZH2 inhibition may 
induce similar effects. In addition, loss of EZH2 has been described as affecting T  helper cell 
plasticity [Tumes  2013 ] and is proposed to inhibit the function of regulatory T cells [
Arvey 
2014; DuPage 2015; Yang 2015 ], suggesting that EZH2 inhi bition may contribute to enhancing 
antitumor immunity. 
In summary, the available nonclinical data suggest that EZH2 mutant lymphomas should show 
the highest sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition, but wild -type cases could also be affected through 
tumor cell auton omous mechanisms (mutations in MLL2, HATs, ubiquitously transcribed 
tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome [ UTX] , etc.) and/or effects of EZH2 inhibitors on the 
tumor microenvironment.    
2.3. Solid Tumors  
In addition to the EZH2 gain of function activation mutations described above, overexpression or amplification of EZH2 has been described in numerous tumor types, including not but limited to bladder, breast cancer, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, ovarian, prostate, mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, re nal carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and stomach cancer [ LaFave 2015, Comet  
2016, Kuroki 2014].   This is partially explained by [CONTACT_12363]2 gene expression by 
[CONTACT_12364]-E2F pathway, which is dysregulated in many tumor types [ Bracken 2003]. In many of 
these tumors, EZH2 has been demonstrated to function as an oncogene [ Comet 2016] . For 
instance, EZH2 overexpression promotes anchorage-independent growth and cell invasion in breast cancer [ Kleer 2003], proliferation and epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]- mesenchymal transition in lung cancer 
[Takawa 2011, Tiwari  2013], and tumorigenesis and metastasis in prostate cancer [ Min 2010]. 
These data suggest that inhibition of EZH2 might also be beneficial in solid tumors that overexpress EZH2 or contain amplifications of the EZH2 gene. 
Genetic changes in other proteins in addition to genetic alterations in EZH2 itself, can lead to an 
oncogenic dependency on EZH2 activity, specifically those affecting proteins of the SWItch/Sucrose Non -Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex.  At many gene 
loci, polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) and SWI/SNF antagonize each other and loss of the 
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -105 
Amendment 4.0  
  
 
   
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc . Page 30 of 116 
Confidential  28 September 2018 
 
 SWI/SNF component, integrase interactor 1 (INI1), has been demonstrated to generate over-
activation of the PRC2 pathway and tumor cell proliferation [ Wilson, 2010]. Genetic loss of INI1 
has been described in many human malignancies, e.g., rhabdoid tumors, epi[INVESTIGATOR_12311], epi[INVESTIGATOR_12312], extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, myoepi[INVESTIGATOR_12313],  and renal medullary carcinoma [ Margol, 2014]. Inhibition of EZH2 
activity by [CONTACT_12365] -down or small molecule inhibition induces tumor cell killing and 
durable tumor regressions in pre-clinical models of rhabdoid tumors [ Alimova  2013; Knutson 
2013].   Genetic alterations in synovial sarcomas can create a state of INI1 deficiency and result 
in aberrant SWI/SNF complex chromatin remodeling activity at various genes [ Kadoch, 2013], 
sensitizing these tumors to EZH2 inhibition [ Kawano , 2016]. Loss of SMARCA2 and 
SMARCA4 protein, the redundant catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling 
complex, have been described in small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type [ Jellinic 
2014; Ramos 2014; Witkowski 2014], and inhibition of EZH2 activity in in vivo prec linical 
models by a small molecule inhibitor results in dose dependent tumor growth inhibition and regressions [Penebre 2017]. It has additionally been postulated that additional tumor types with loss or mutation of SWI/SNF subunits, such as ovarian cancer with loss of ARID1A, would also be sensitive to EZH2 inhibition [ Bitler 2015; Kim 2015]. Given that approximately 20% of 
tumors contain a mutation in one or more subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, this suggests that EZH2 inhibition might have therapeutic value in a diverse number of solid tumor types [ Kadoch 
2016]. 
Finally, genetic and/or protein loss of chromatin remodelers other than SWI/SNF have been 
associated with sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition. For instance, BRACA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) can also l ead to an oncogen ic dependency on EZH2 activity [ LaFave 2015]. This is 
clinically relevant as genetic and/or protein loss of BAP1 has also been described in multiple human malignancies including mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, renal carcinoma, and cholangioc arcinoma [ Testa 2011; Harbour 2010; Pena-Llopis 2012; Jiao 2013].  
2.4. Tazemetostat 
2.4.1 Preclinical Pharmacology  
Tazemetostat (EPZ -6438) is a selective oral small molecule inhibitor of EZH2.   Tazemetostat 
inhibits both wild -type EZH2 and mutant bearing EZH2 residues  with Y641, A667G and A687 
with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) ranging from 2-38 nmol/L.  The compound shows a 35- fold selectivity over the most closely related HMT, EZH1 , and greater than a 4500-
fold selectively over other HMTs.   It selectively inhibits intracellular H3K27 methylation in a 
concentration - and time- dependent manner, leading to selective cell killing of cell lines.

 Tazemetostat specifically inhibits human lymphoma cell lines bearing EZH2 point mutations and 
integrase interacto r 1 (INI1 ) unit deficient (also known as SNF5, SMARCB1, or BAFT47) MRT 
cell lines with IC50 in the nanomolar range.  Additionally, tazemetostat administered orally has 
demonstrated antitumor activity in vivo against several EZH2 mutant human lymphoma xenog raft murine models [ Knutson, 2014].    
2.4.2 Lymphomas  
Antitumor effects of oral tazemetostat dosing were evaluated in 3 EZH2  mutant DLBCL 
xenograft models; WSU -DLCL2 EZH2  Y646F, KARPAS -422 EZH2  Y646N, and Pfeiffer EZH2  
A682G.   In severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice bearing WSU- DLCL2 EZH2  
Y646F mutant xenograft tumors, tazemetostat  induced dose -dependent tumor growth inhibition, 
showing a maximum of 58% at the highest dose of 160  mg/kg 3 times daily.   A dose -dependent 
incre ase in plasma and tumor tissue exposure was observed.   ELISA analysis of histones from 
tumors collected on Day  28 indicated dose- dependent reduction in H3K27Me3 levels.  
In KARPAS -422 EZH2  Y646N mutant xenografts, 28-day dosing of tazemetostat on a twice 
daily (BID) schedule induced tumor growth inhibition at doses as low as 80.5 mg/kg BID, but all 
higher doses induced complete xenograft tumor regression ( Figure 1A ). When investigating 
intermittent dosing schedules in this model, tazemetostat  showed significant dose -dependent 
antitumor effects with 2 cycles of 7 -day on/7 -day off and 21 day on/7 day off  schedules 
(Figure 1B ).  For all dosing schedules, tumor growth inhibition and complete regressions were 
observed at 90 and 361 mg/kg BID, respectively.  In a paralle l study, the inhibition of 
H3K27Me3 by [CONTACT_12366] -422 human DLBCL xenografts in 
athymic mice.   Tazemetostat induced a dose -dependent reduction of tumor H3K27Me3 levels 
with both regimens ( Figure 2 ).

The Pfeiffer EZH2  A682G mutant xenograft model was the most sensitive DLBCL tumor model.   
Complete tumor regressions were  observed in all animals in the 114 mg/kg tazemetostat  once 
daily and 342 mg/kg once daily dose groups. Tumor regrowth was not observed up to the end of 
the study (36 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12314]).  
2.4.3 Solid T umors  
Oral administration of tazemetostat in 4 NSCLC cell line xenografts with dual SMARCA2/A4  
loss demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression s.  As shown in  Figure 3, tumor 
regression was observed in the NCI H522 and NCI -H661 NSCLC xenograft models at ≥ 125  
mg/kg and ≥ 250 mg/kg, respectively .  Significant tumor growth inhibition but not tumor 
regression s was seen in the A427 and NCI-H1703 NSCLC xenografts at ≥ 250 mg/kg.  In 
addition, antitumor activity was observed in xenograft models of INI -[ADDRESS_11784] antitumor activity was demonstrated in the G401 INI1-negative human malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) xenograft model following oral dosing with tazemetostat.  Figure 4 A and

 2.4.4 In Vitro Aqueous Solubility  
The solubility of tazemetostat was investigated in buffer systems of pH 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.5, and 
6.8.  Mean solubility of tazemetostat was approximately 7 mg/mL at pH values of 1.0 to 4.0.  However, mean aqueous solubility of tazemetostat decreased to 0.508 mg/mL and 0.0333 
mg/mL at pH 5.5 and pH 6.8, respectively.  The pH values at which the aqueous solubility changes are similar to the pKa values for tazemetostat of 5.3 and 6.9. 
2.4.5 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
Sixteen metabolites of tazemetostat were identified from incubations of liver microsomes and 
hepatocytes from mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. The major metabolites in liver microsomal incubations were the result of N -deethylation (M5, EPZ-6930), oxidation of the 
pyridone (M7), and dual oxidation (M12). The major metabolites in hepatocyte incubations were the results of oxidation and dehydrogenation (M11), and N-dealkylation of the pyridone (M13). EPZ-6930 appeared to be the major metabo lite formed in liver microsomes and hepatocytes from 
monkey and human. There was no metabolite observed that was considered to be unique to humans. 
Results from in vitro studies with human liver microsomes suggested that CYP3A, CYP2C8, and 
CYP2D6 were involved in the metabolism of tazemetostat. In experiments using recombinant human CYPs (Supersomes
TM), CYP3A4 was the only isoform which caused detectable turnover 
of tazemetostat. Taken together, these results suggest that CYP3A4 is the predominant enzyme involved in tazemetostat metabolism with potentially lesser contributions from CYP2C8 and CYP2D6. 
Tazemetostat inhibited CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A (testosterone 6β-
hydroxylation) activities in vitro with Ki values of 1.3, 15.0, 6.7, 9.2, and 3.1  µmol/L, 
respectively.   The IC
50 values for tazemetostat inhibition of CYP3A -mediated midazolam 1' 
hydroxylation and nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_12315] 12.7 and 19.4 µmol/L, respectively.  Tazemetostat demonstrated time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A with a half- maximum 
inactivation of 6.4 µmol/L and maximum rate constant of inactivation of 0.077 min
-1.  
Tazemetostat induced CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes in vitro with concentration that achieved 50% of the maximal effect values of 2.18 to 2.96 µmol /L, and maximum effect values of 15.62- 
to 103.5-fold increase in mRNA. Tazemetostat may induce other CYP isoforms, such as CYP1A, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9, but the effect is expected to be much weaker than that observed for induction of CYP3A4.

 A physiologicall y-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed based on in vitro and in 
vivo data to simulate the effect of tazemetostat on CYP probe substrates.   The model was used to 
predict the magnitude of interaction of tazemetostat with probe substrates for CYP2 C8 
(repaglinide and rosiglitazone), CYP2C9 (S-warfarin), and CYP2C19 (omeprazole and S-
mephenytoin) based upon the in vitro Ki and protein binding values.  Simulations also were conducted to predict the magnitude of interaction of tazemetostat given a wors t-case scenario 
with Ki values [ADDRESS_11787] been characterized 
following single (Day 1) and multiple (Day 15) dose administration to subjects with advanced 
solid tum ors or B -cell lymphoma (n=36). Doses administered were 100 mg BID as a suspension 
(n=3) or tablet (n=3) formulation and 200, 400, 800, and 1600 mg BID as a tablet formulation. Tazemetostat was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_12316] a time to the maximum plasma concentratio n (T
max) of 
approximately 1-2 hours postdose .  Plasma concentrations declined in a mono -exponential 
manner with a mean t 1/[ADDRESS_11788] dose.  The 
tazemetostat maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax) and area under the concentration -time curve 
(AUC) increased in a greater than dose-proportional fashion after a single dose and in an approximately a dose-proportional fashion at steady -state.    
After multiple dosing, there was a dose- dependent decrease in tazemetostat exposure between 
Days 1 and 15.  Accumulation ratios (R
ac = AUC D15/AUC D1) evaluated at Day 15 of dosing were 
0.89 at 100 mg BID (suspension) and 0.48 at 1600 mg B ID.  The R ac at the RP2D of 800  mg BID 
was 0.58.  Further reduction in systemic exposure at steady -state was not observed beyond 
Day 15 as evidenced by [CONTACT_12370] (observed concentration at the end of a dosing interval, 
immediately before the next adm inistration) levels from Days 15 to 29.  There was negligible 
change in T max or t 1/2 on multiple dosing across the dose range.     
The Tmax for the tazemetostat metabolite EPZ -6930 was observed at 1 to 2 hours after 
tazemetostat administration and its elim ination paralleled that of tazemetostat (t 1/2 = 3 – 5 hours).  
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -[ADDRESS_11789] to the parent compound, C max and AUC of the metabolite increased after multiple 
dosing.  Metabolite -to-parent AUC ratios (EPZ -6930 relative to tazemetostat) ranged from 
approximately 0.[ADDRESS_11790] dose and its elimination paralleled that of tazemetostat (t ½ =3-5 hours).  
The time -dependency in kinetics of both parent and the desethyl metabolite are consistent with 
induction of CYP3A- mediated metabolism by [CONTACT_12371].    
The effect of food on the PK of tazemetostat was investigated as part of Study E7438 -G000-101.  
Subjects with advanced solid tumors or B- cell lymphomas received [ADDRESS_11791] portion of Study E7438-G000-101 is displayed in Table 4 .

 Administration of tazemetostat with a high -fat meal decreased geometric mean AUC 0-∞ and C max 
values approximately 18% and 38%, respectively, relative to administration in the fasted state.   
However, the 90% CI for the fed: fasted  geometric mean ratio for both C max and AUC 0-∞ 
contained 1.  Administration of tazemetostat with a high -fat meal also resulted in a 4 -fold 
increase in median T max relative to administration in the fasted state.   Geometric mean  t1/2 values 
were nearly identical after administration in the fed and fasted state (4.24 h and 4.10 h, 
respectively).   These results indicate that administration of tazemetostat with a high -fat breakfast 
results in slower absorption into the systemic circulation with no effect on the systemic disposition or overall exposure to tazemetostat as measured by [CONTACT_12265].   The decrease in systemic 
exposure is not clinically significant, and therefore tazemetostat can be taken without regards to meals.  
The effect of  tazemetostat on the PK of midazolam also was investigated as part of Study E7438 -
G000-101.  Subjects with solid tumors (n=13) received a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam on Day -1 and on Day 15.  Tazemetostat 800 mg BID was administered continuously starting on 
Day 1.   Serial blood samples for the analysis of plasma midazolam and metabolites were 
collected over 24 h on Day - 1 (midazolam alone) and Day 15 (midazolam plus tazemetostat).  
A summary of preliminary midazolam PK parameters after administration alone (Day -1) and 
with tazemetostat 800 mg BID (Day 15) in subject s with solid tumors is presented in Table 6 .

 administration with tazemetostat 800 mg BID relative to administration of midazolam  alone.   
Geometric mean t1/2 for midazolam decreased approximately 25%, after administration of 
midazolam with tazemetostat 800 mg BID relative to administration of midazolam alone.   These 
results indicate that administration of tazemetostat 800 mg BID resulted in net induction of 
CYP3A -mediated metabolism in subjects with solid tumors.  The decrease in midazolam AUC 0-∞ 
caused by [CONTACT_12372] 800 mg BID was less than 50%.  
Therefore, tazemetostat 800 mg administered BID is  a weak inducer of CYP3A -mediated 
metabolism.  
2.4.7 Clinical Experience 
In 2013, Study E7438-G000-101, a single- agent, Phase 1/[ADDRESS_11792] also been initiated and are currently recruiting subjects:  
• EZH -102, A Phase 1 Study of the EZH2 Inhibitor Tazemetostat in Pediatric Subjects with 
Relapsed or Ref ractory INI1 -Negative Tumors or Synovial Sarcoma  
• EZH -202 A Phase 2, Multicenter Study of the EZH2 Inhibitor Tazemetostat in Adult 
Subjects with INI1 -Negative Tumors or Relapsed/Refractory Synovial Sarcoma    
• EZH -203, A Phase 2, Multicenter Study of the EZH2 Inhibitor Tazemetostat in Adult 
Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Malignant Mesothelioma with BAP1 Loss of 
Function   
As of the cutoff date of 15 -Jan. 2016, subjects with advanced solid tumors or B- cell lymphoma 
(N=88), or with INI-negative tumors (N=1) have been enrolled and exposed to tazemetostat in 
these 3 studies.  
As of the 15-Jan. 2016 cutoff date, 78 of 89 (87.6%) subjects experienced  one or more treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and 51 of 89 (57.3%) subjects experienced TEAEs that were considered by [CONTACT_12373]. The most common TEAEs, any 
grade, in descending order of frequency were asthenia, nausea, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, anemia, constipation, dysgeusia, vomiting, diarrhea, dry skin, dyspnea, muscle spasms, and abdominal pain. Twenty-two (22) of 89 (24.7%) subjects experienced Grade 3 or 4 AEs, 7 (7.9%) of which were considered related to study drug. Five (5.6%) subjects in the study discontinued tazemetostat treatment due to AEs.

 In addition, 22 subjects experienced a total of 31 serious adverse events (SAE). Of these, 
4 (12.9%) were considered possibly related to study drug (neutropenia [2], anemia [1], and thrombocytopenia [1]).  Eleven subjects died in Study E7438-G000-101.  Nine of the  deaths 
were attributed to progressive disease, one event was attributed to an AE, and one death was 
reported as “not due to progressive disease” (no further information available at time of data cutoff date of 15 -Jan. 2016).   
As of 07 -Nov. 2015, antitumo r activity has been noted (phase 1 part only) in subjects with B- cell 
lymphoma and with INI1-deficient tumors. Objective responses were demonstrated in 9 of 16 subjects  (5/10 with DLBCL, 3/5 with FL, and 1/1 with MZL) with B -cell lymphoma ( 2 complete 
responses [CR] and 7 partial responses [PR]) and in 4 of 11  subjects with INI1- deficiency (one 
CR and 3 PRs) who were evaluable for response per protocol (defined as having measurable 
disease, and least one post- baseline scan, and received at least one dose of study drug). Of the [ADDRESS_11793] clinical activity in subjects with genetically defined INI1 negative tumors consisting of 3 of 6 subjects showing objective response (1 CR + 2 PRs) within [ADDRESS_11794] re-stagin g at 8 weeks.  Further information on clinical efficacy and safety can be found in the 
tazemetostat Investigator’s Brochure (IB), Version 8.0. 
2.5. Study and Dose Rationale 
2.5.1 Study Rationale  
Tazemetostat is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in vitro.   Inhibition o f CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_11795] potent inhibition (lowest Ki 
values) was for the CYP2C8 and CYP3A isoforms followed by [CONTACT_097]2C19.  The effect of 
tazemetostat on the PK of the sensitive CYP3A probe midazolam was determined in Study 
E7438-G000-101.  Therefore, Part B of  this study will determine the effect of tazemetostat on 
the PK of the CYP2C8 probe medication repaglinide and the CYP2C19 probe medication 
omeprazole.    
The solubility of tazemetostat is pH dependent and an increase in gastric pH may alter the oral absorption of tazemetostat.   In addition to a CYP2C19 probe medication, omeprazole is a 
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -[ADDRESS_11796] of increased gastric pH on the PK of 
tazemetostat will be determined in Part B by [CONTACT_12374] 4 
days.    
2.5.2 Dose Rationale  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tazemetostat 
The safety, tolerability, clinical activity, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments from the 
subjects treated in the Dose Escalation part of Study E7438-G000- [ADDRESS_11797] the 
recommended P hase 2 dose (RP2D).   As of [ADDRESS_11798] had tumor assessments while on study drug. Objective 
responses were observed in 5/10 DLBCL, 3/5 FL, and 1/1 MZL subjects. An MTD was not established with tazemetostat  doses of up to 1600 mg BID. 
A relationship between tazemetostat AUC on Day 15 and inhibition of H3K27Me3 in the stratum spi[INVESTIGATOR_12317] E
max model. The tazemetostat AUC 0-12 at 
whic h the H3K27Me3 inhibition was 50% of maximal (EC 50) was 848 ng*h/mL and the 
maximum effect (E max) was 51% inhibition.  The predicted inhibition of H3K27Me3 in the 
stratum spi[INVESTIGATOR_12318] 15 AUC 0-12 in the 800 mg BID  dose 
coho rt (3670 ng*h/mL) was over 80% of E max.  These results suggest that target inhibition in the 
skin was near maximal at [ADDRESS_11799] of increased gastric pH on the PK of tazemetostat 
in the current study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Fluconazole plus Tazemetostat  
Fluconazole doses up to 400 mg daily may be used to treat candida infections and for prophylaxis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.  Administration of a single dose of 400 mg fluconazole followed by 200 mg fluconazole daily for 5 days increased midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A probe substrate) AUC and C
max 259% and 150%, respectively, after oral 
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -[ADDRESS_11800] dose of fluconazole.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Repaglinide  
The starting dose for repaglinide in patients not previously treated or whose hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA
1c) is < 8% is 0.[ADDRESS_11801] on blood glucose in subjects in this study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Omeprazole  
The recommended dose of omeprazole to treat duodenal ulcers and gastro -esophageal reflux is 
20 mg once daily for 4 to 8 weeks.  A daily dose of 20 mg omeprazole was reported to maintain 
a median gastric pH of 4.5 over 24 hours [ Houben, 1995].  Therefore, omeprazole [ADDRESS_11802] of increased gastric pH on the PK of tazemetostat .   
2.6. Benefit: Risk Assessments 
2.6.1 Animal Toxicology 
Nonclinical safety assessments of tazemetostat included in vitro and monkey safety 
pharmacology studies, genotoxicity studies, and single- and repeat -dose toxicity studies in 
Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys of 4- and 13 weeks duration. No notabl e 
cardiovascular, central nervous system (CNS), or respi[INVESTIGATOR_12319]. Tazemetostat was not genotoxic in standard in vitro and in vivo assays. The following potential risks were identified for t azemetostat based on nonclinical 
safety data: T -LBL (rat), increased bone formation in bone and teeth (rat), non- progressive bile 
duct hyperplasia (monkey), teratogenicity (rat and rabbit), lymphoid depletion (rat and monkey), and phototoxic potential (in vitro). Other effects at high, non- tolerated doses, toxicities included

Confidential  28 September 2018 
 
 bone marrow effects (hypocellularity, rat), and gastrointestinal toxicity (distention, ulceration, 
and degeneration, rat).  
Steady -state exposures (area under the concentration –time cu rve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC0- 24]) 
in rats at the lowest dose (100 mg/kg/day) at which no T- LBL occurred in the 13- week 
adolescent rat study were 2.5- to 7.5-fold greater than that observed in humans at the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D; 800 mg twice daily [BID]) from the ongoing Phase 1/[ADDRESS_11803] tazemetostat dose, and additionally will be actively monitored for signs or symptoms of abnormal bone formation.      
2.6.2 Photo -Reactive Potential  
There are nonclinical data supporting a potential for phototoxicity, which has not been evaluated 
in humans. Hence, prolonged exposure to sunlight should be avoided during treatment. In addition, subjects should take other measures to avoid ultraviolet (UV ) exposure such as wearing 
sun screen and sun glasses, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding tanning beds. Refer to the tazemetostat Investigator’s Brochure 8.0 for details . 
2.6.3 Metabolism and Transporters  
Tazemetostat is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A and  is a substrate for P -glycoprotein (Pgp).  
Therefore, treatment with strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A within [ADDRESS_11804] frequently 
reported TEAEs (all grades and in descending order) that occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects enrolled 
in the P hase 1 part of study   E7438-G000-101 included the following  (as of the 15-Jan.2016 
cutoff  date, n = 62):  Asthenia (34.8%), nausea (15.7%), thrombocytopenia (14.6%), decreased

 appetite (13.5%), anemia (12.4%), constipation (12.4%), dysgeusia (7.9%), vomiting (7.9%), 
diarrhea (6.7%), dry skin (6.7%), dyspnea (6.7%) muscle spasms (6.7%), abdominal pain (5.6%) and neutropenia (5.6%).  TEAEs did not appear to be dose dependent.  There have been [ADDRESS_11805] each: thrombocytopenia ([ADDRESS_11806]) and 
neutropenia (2 subjects).  All 3 events were considered related to study drug and required 
withdrawal of study drug.   For up -to date information on AESIs, see Section 11.5. Additionally,  
there is the unknown risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes and drug- drug interactions  (DDI) . 
Based on the pre clinical toxicology of tazemetostat, the potential risks associated with treatment 
include bone AEs and photosensitivity . 
2.7. Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12320], as outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312, subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 CFR, Part 50 (1998) and 21 CFR, Part 56, (1998) are followed.

IRB/EC should apply local and/or state law(s) related to the age at which an individual is considered a minor (child) or an adult for medical decision -making.     
8.2. Screening Assessments  
A signed, wr itten informed consent (and assent, if applicable) must be obtained prior to any 
study- specific assessments or procedures being performed.  
All screening assessments, including tumor assessment, must be performed within [ADDRESS_11851]’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood counts, 
chemistries, imaging studies) and obtained prior to consent may be used for screening provided 
the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed in the timeframe of the 
study. 
8.2.1 Demographics and Medical History  
A complete medical history will be taken  and is to include medical conditions at screening.  
Information to be documented includes demographic information, prior medical illnesses and 
conditions, and surgical procedures.  
8.3. Study Assessments  
For study assessments not included in sections below (e.g., vital signs, ECOG  performance 
status ), refer to the Schedule of Assessments  and Procedures  (Table 1 and Table 2) for details.   A

8.3.7 Pharmacogenomics (PGx)  
A single whole blood sample (10 mL) is to be collected during the screening phase to provide 
DNA for analysis of genes involved in drug disposition (i.e., absorption, distribution, 
metabolism , and excretion [ADME]).   This will support investigation of whether subject 
genotype, specifically of ADME genes, is related to the DDI potential of tazemetostat.

expression profiling, and/or proteomic analysis. As available the diagnostic pathology block or 
slides obtained at the time of the subject ’s diagnosis and/or time of subsequent procedures is 
acceptable. The sponsor or designee will return all blocks to the original site on completion of the planned analyses.  
An effort will be made to obtain  paired  tumor tissue biops ies before and after initiation of 
treatment with tazemetostat.   An optional lymph node, core-needle biopsy, or bone marrow 
biopsy will be performed during the screening period and on Day 1 of Cycle 2.  A window of 14 days before and after  Day 1 of Cycle 2 will be allowe d (i.e., biopsy must be done between Day 
14 of Cycle 1 and Day 14 of Cycle 2).  Biopsies will be performed by a surgeon, if necessary, or by [CONTACT_12387].   A cytopathologist will evaluate the biopsy microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_12326] o f the biopsy.  If multiple lymph nodes are available, the safest lymph 
node will be selected.  The choice of core biopsy versus incisional or excisional biopsy will be made based on safety, accessibility, and the likelihood of being pathologic.  If the subject has a single target lesion, this lesion will not be eligible for correlative biopsy.    
All subjects  will indicate consent or denial for the optional studies within the main consent form 
for this study.  
Tumor tissue may be analyzed for DNA, mRNA and/or protein endpoints up to and including whole genome analysis. The data generated (from subject s who enroll in EZH -501) will be 
combined with equivalent data from additional tazemetostat single-agent studies of NHL subject s to determine candidate biomarkers  of response to tazemetostat. The results of these 
analys es will be reported outside of this protocol.  
8.3.9 Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
All clinical laboratory assays will be performed at local laboratories according to the laboratory’s normal procedures.  Reference ranges will be supplied by [CONTACT_12388].   Abnormal 
laboratory values which are unexpected or not explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical conditio n 
should be repeated until confirmed, explained, or resolved.  Laboratory value changes starting from the initial tazemetostat exposure will be recorded in the eCRF as an AE if clinically significant.

 Hematology:  Hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, differential blood count with ANC, platelet count 
and peripheral blood smear morphology are performed at screening and at regular intervals.  
Bone Marrow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/Biopsy:  At screening, a peripheral blood  smear  will be collected  along  
with normal  hematology  testing  and assessed for abnormal morphology.  If results  are abnormal 
then the  patient will be required  to undergo a bone marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy  conducted by [CONTACT_12389] . If morphology  is abnormal, then cytogenetic testing  will be conducted to  
closely  monitor patients with cytogenetic testing and DNA sequencing for abnormalities  known 
to be associated  with  MDS  (e.g. del 5q, chr 7 abn) and MPN  (e.g. JAK2  V617F). If the results 
are abnormal (per the local laboratory) and are associated with myeloid malign ancies, the patient 
will be excluded from the study. 
During the study, additional tests including complete peripheral blood smear morphology 
assessment along with normal hematology testing will be included. If the morphology assessment shows abnormal results a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy will be required for cytogenetic testing  and DNA sequencing as conducted by [CONTACT_12082] . If cytogenetic

control after discussion with the medical monitor .  
 
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -[ADDRESS_11872] dose of tazemetostat (as well as the total treatment period) must be recorded in the eCRF and source documents.  Similarly, if a subject has died on study, the cause and date of death must be report ed as well.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_11873] data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of 
the study, and where permitted, publicly available data can be included after withdrawal of consent (e.g., death records).  The investigator must document this agreement regarding withdrawal of full consent as well as discuss appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.    
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study might include the following: 
• Death  
• Decision by [CONTACT_12392]  
• Subject request to withdraw from study 
• Lost to follow -up 
10.2. Survival Follow- Up 
Subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment will be followed (by [CONTACT_648], email , or 
clinic visit) for survival every [ADDRESS_11874] -treatment follow -up visit prior to initiating any subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy (approved or investigational).   Post -study anti- cancer therapy will not be 
provided as part of this study. The subject may receive subsequent anti- cancer therapy at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  The subsequent anti -cancer therapy should be documented 
on the eCRF. 
10.4. Evaluation of Response to Sub sequent Anti -Cancer Therapy  
To identify a potential epi[INVESTIGATOR_12330], subjects who are withdrawn 
from this study due to disease progression and who go on to receive subsequent induction therapy should be followed for response whenever possible.  Data to be recorded on the subsequent regimen should include agents received, best response, and duration of response (DOR). 
10.5. Replacement  of Subjects  
For both parts of the study, s ubjects who require a dose reduction of tazemetostat duri ng the first 
[ADDRESS_11875] a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP , whether or not related to the IP.  
Worsening of a pre- treatment event, after initiation of tazemetostat, must be recorded as a new 
AE.  For example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dyspepsia prior to dosing 
tazemetostat, but the dyspepsia becomes severe and more frequent after the first dose of tazemetostat, a new AE of severe worsening dyspepsia (with the appropriate date of onset) should be recorded in the eCRF. 
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of an expected pharmacological action” per se  is not to be reported 
as an AE or SAE.   However, any signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
“lack of efficacy” will be reported as an AE or SAE, if they fulfill the definition of an AE or 
SAE.  
Events that do not  meet the definition of an AE include: 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads 
to the procedure is an AE. 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• The disease/disorder being studied, or signs  or symptoms of the disease/disorder being 
studied, unless more severe than expected for t he subject’s condition.

event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12331]:   In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
out-patient setting. Complications tha t occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is 
serious.   When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE. 
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or  
NOTE:   The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct no rmal life functions.   This definition is not intended to include experiences of 
relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or  
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate 
in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12333]. These shoul d also be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions (in subjects without pre- existing seizure disorder) that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
11.3. Laboratory Abnormalities 
A clinical laboratory AE is any laboratory value that is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_12393] a medical intervention or is accompanied by [CONTACT_12394].  
Laboratory abnormalities that have not required medical intervention should not be recorded as

 AEs and will be captured and reported in the l aboratory section of the clinical study report 
(CSR).   If a medical intervention occurs, it should be r ecorded as a treatment with the abnormal 
laboratory finding as the AE (e.g., anemia with treatment required and blood transfusion 
recorded as a procedure, hyperglycemia with treatment required and change in insulin dose recorded on concomitant medications). 
The investigator  should decide, based upon the AE criteria and the clinical condition of the 
patient, whether a change in a laboratory parameter is clinically significant and therefore 
represents an AE.  
If, at the end of the treatment phase with the study drug, there are pathological laboratory values which were not present at baseline, further clinical or laboratory investigations should be performed until the values return to within reference range or until a plausible explanation (i.e., concomitant disease) is found for the pathological laboratory values. 
11.4. Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities  
Other  safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including 
those that worsen from baseline and events
 in the medical and scientific judgment of the 
investigator are considered to be clinically significant, are to be recorded as an AE or SAE, in 
accordance with the definitions provided in Sections 11.2.1 and  11.2.2, respectively.    
Any other safety assessment that led to an intervention, including permanent discontinuation of study treatment, dose reduction, and/or dose interruption/delay is also to be recorded as an AE or SAE.    
Events that meet the criteria for serious but are thought to be associated with progression of disease under study should be reported as SAEs but will not typi[INVESTIGATOR_12334].  
NOT E: Disease progression per se should not be reported as an SAE. 
11.5. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)  
11.5.1 T-LBL/T- ALL  
Lymphoblastic lymphomas are considered thymus derived malignancies that have not yet 
completed T -cell maturations. Approximately 90% of lymphoblastic lymphomas are the T -cell 
phenotype and typi[INVESTIGATOR_12335], accounting for 29% of pediatric 
and 2% of adult NHL with a median age at diagnosis of 25 years ( Lai, 2013 ; Cortelazzo, 2017 ;

 Lones, 2007 ). T-LBL is morpho logically and immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_12336] T- ALL, with 
both diseases arising from precursor lymphoid cells of the T -cell lineage ( Portell, 2012; Patel, 
2014). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_12337], significant yet unknown characteristics lea d to 
differences in clinical presentations ( Burkhardt, 2009 ). Initial clinical manifestation of both adult 
and pediatric T -LBL includes a mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy with <25% bone marrow 
blasts. Adult T -LBL patients tend to have less thymic disease and greater lymph node disease and 
bone marrow involvement (Baleydier, 2008;  Swerdlow, 2008 ; Campo, 2011). In contrast, T -ALL 
cases predominantly present with bone marrow and peripheral blood disease, and >25% bone 
marrow blasts ( Swerdlow, 2008; Campo, 2011 ). 
On [ADDRESS_11877] on study EZH-102. This event was reported to regulatory authorities as a 7-day S[LOCATION_003]R on 13 April 2018 (Case number 
2018USEPZ64380299).  
Following this report, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12338] a comprehensive evaluation, including: 
 
• Review of literature and available preclinical/clinical data to better understand event of 
T-LBL.   
• Review of the literature and available preclinical/clinical data to better understand the risk of MDS/AML and myeloid malignancies, and other solid tumor malignancies.  
• Assessment of safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) at various doses tested, benefit- risk across 
tumor types in adults and children. 
• Consultation with well recognized external experts in T -cell lymphoma and 
pediatr ic/adult oncology.  
Based on this evaluation, we continue to believe that tazemetostat is a clinically active drug and has the potential to benefit both adult and pediatric patients across different tumor types where 
there are unmet medical needs.   We also  conclude that the risk assessment identifies a possible 
direct association between tazemetostat and T -LBL/T -ALL. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12339] T-

 The event of T -LBL in a 9 -year-old (at the time of enrollment) female subject diagnosed with 
poorly differentiated chordoma occurred on Study Day 432 of treatment with tazemetostat 900 
mg/m2 BID. At the time of the event of T -LBL, the subject was in complete response of her 
target lesions of the disease under study, yet due to presence of 1 of 2 non- target lesion in her 
lung (1 lesion disappeared), was considered overall as a partial responder. The first response was 
observed and measured at Day [ADDRESS_11879] was 18,784 ng•h/mL and is simi lar to the mean AUC 0-24h at Cycle 1 Day 15 for the 
900 mg/m2 dose group overall (21,000 ng•h/mL, n=5). The study medication was discontinued 
and the subject withdrawn from the study due to the event. 
 
Induction therapy was initiated on 06 April 2018 with the following regimen: cytrarabine, 
daunorubicin, dexamethasone, dexrazoxane. Methotrexate was subsequently started on [ADDRESS_11880] a good overall prognosis as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] T- LBL 
in children when treated appropriately.  
The S[LOCATION_003]R of T -LBL resulted in the Sponsor initiating a temporary global halt in enrollment 
for the pediatric study EZH-102. In addition, this event l ed to a partial clinical hold (PCH) on 
new subject enrollment for tazemetostat by [CONTACT_941] U.S. (FDA), [LOCATION_009] (ANSM), and [LOCATION_013] 
(BfArM) across all studies of the Tazemetostat Development Program. For further details, see the Investigator’s Brochure, version 8 .0. In the event of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] T- LBL/T -ALL or related 
concerns, please refer to Section 7.3 for evaluation and dose adjustments.   
Heightened surveillance will b e conducted to monitor and identify early signs and symptoms 
(per local practice/standard of care) of T -LBL/T -ALL so that tazemetostat may be discontinued 
in the subject and treatment can be initiated for these malignancies. If a case of adult T -LBL/T -
ALL occurs enrollment will be suspended and the benefit-risk of the drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_12395].  
11.5.2 MDS/AML/MPN  
As of the May 01 2018 data cut, 3 cases of MDS/AML/MPN have been reported. One case of

8.0. In the event of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_12341], please refer to Section 
6.5 for evaluation and dose adjustments.  Heightened surveillance  will be conducted to monitor 
and identify early signs and symptoms (per local practice/standard of care) of any MDS/AML and other myeloid malignancies like MPN.  For any MDS/AML or other myeloid malignancies 
like MPN, tazemetostat will be held, and after discussion with the Investigator, tazemetostat will 
be modified or discontinued. All AESIs are to be reported on the eCRF whether or not they meet the criteria for  an SAE.  
11.5.3 Other Identified Risks  
• AEs considered related to abnormal bone formation and confirmed by a radiologic 
scan.  
• AEs associated with treatment overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error; and any 
treatment -emergent significant laboratory abnormality .  
11.5.4 Tazemetostat Safety Committee  
A safety monitoring committee  composed  of internal and external medical experts will review 
all AESI  cases, including T-LBL/ALL, MDS/AML and other myeloid malignancies like MPN 
(both related and unrelated), and other solid tumor malignancies. Cases  will be evaluated for 
suspected relationship to  tazemetostat  and adjudicated by [CONTACT_12396]. Recommendations for next 
steps per the risk management plan will be communicated to the CMO.  
11.6. Grading and Severity  
The severity of all A Es and SAEs, including appropriate laboratory values, will be graded 
utilizing the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03.  The link to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 is: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf

 Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local , or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADLa 
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self -care ADLb 
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated . 
Grade 5:  Death related to AE . 
ADL = Activities of Daily  Living; AE = adverse event  
a. Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
b. Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications,  
and not bedridden.  
 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category 
used for rating the intensity of an event (as in ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, or ‘severe’); both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.   An event is described as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre-
defined outcomes as described in Section 11.2.2 which are based on patient/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning  
11.7. Relationship Categorization 
A qualified investigator  must make the determination of relationship to tazemetostat for each AE 
or SAE.   The investigator  should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_12371].    
11.7.1 Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment  
The following should be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to study treat ment:  
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the first dose of tazemetostat  
• The course of the event, considering especially the effect of discontinuation of study 
treatment or the reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable  
• Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar treatments  
• The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of 
the event  
• The presence of non -study treatment -related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event.

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc . Page 88 of 116 
Confidential  28 September 2018 
 
 The relationship of an AE to study treatment is to be classified as follows: 
• Not Related:  A causal relationship between tazemetostat and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility. 
• Related:   A causal relationship between tazemetostat and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility (includes probably, possibly, and definitely related).    
If the causal relationship between an AE/SAE and tazemetostat is related, that determination will 
be used for purposes of expedited regulator y reporting. 
11.8. Outcome Categorization  
Outcome of an AE/SAE may be classified as resolved, resolved with sequelae, unresolved, or  
death. 
All treatment- related AEs/SAEs will be followed to resolution (the subject’s health has returned 
to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), or until an outcome is reached, 
stabilization occurs (the investigator  does not expect an y further improvement or worsening of 
the event), or the event is otherwise explained, regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study.   Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed 
to document resolution of the  event(s).  
11.9. Timeframe for Reporting AEs and SAEs  
AEs: AEs will be collected from the time the first dose of study treatment is administered until 
the earlier of either 30 days after the discontinuation of study treatment or until the initiation of subsequen t anti -cancer therapy.  
SAEs: SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs.   In addition, 
any SAE assessed as related  to study participation (e.g., protocol-mandated procedures, invasive 
tests, or change in existing therapy), study treatment must be recorded from the time a subject 
provides consent to participate in the study up to and including any follow-up contact. All SAEs will be reported to the sponsor  within 24 hours.   
After discontinuation of study treatment :  The invest igator will monitor all ongoing 
AEs/SAEs until resolution or stabilization of the event or until the subject is lost to follow -up.  
Up until [ADDRESS_11882] promptly not ify the sponsor  or its designee of all SAEs in order that the legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities of the sponsor  or its designee are met.  
The sponsor  has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of the IP under clinical investigation.   The sponsor  and its 
designee will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relatin g to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRB/EC /CEC  and investigators. 
Any AE that is both unexpected (not consistent with the applicable product information) and also 
meets the definition of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R ). All S[LOCATION_003]Rs 
will be reported within 24 hours of the investigator  becoming aware of the event.   Investigator  
safety reports are prepared for S[LOCATION_003]Rs according to local regulatory requirements and the 
sponsor  policy and are forwarded to investigator s as necessary.   The sponsor  is legally obligated 
to report the event to the regulatory a uthorities within 7  days for fatal or life -threatening 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs or 15 days for all other S[LOCATION_003]Rs. 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) o r other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor  will file it with the IB 
and will notify the IRB/EC /CEC , if appropriate according to local requirements. 
11.10.1 Regulatory Authorities, IRB/EC, and Central Ethics Committees (CEC)  
The sponsor  or its designee is responsible for notifying the investigational sites of all expedited 
SAEs.   The sponsor  or designee shall also notify CEC of new serious, related, and unexpected 
AE(s) or significant risks to subjects, per country requi rements.  
The investigator  will notify the IRB/EC /CEC  of serious, related, and unexpected AE(s) or 
significant risks to subjects, per local country requirements.  The investigator  must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_12343], including correspondence with the spo nsor or local IRB/EC /CEC s on file.  
It is the responsibility of the Principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_12344]/EC of all SAEs that occur at 
his/her site.   Investigator s will be notified of all suspected, unexpected SAEs (7/15- Day Safety 
Reports) that occur during any clinical studies that are using the investigative compound.   Each 
site is responsible for notifying their IRB/EC /CEC  of these additional SAEs.

 12. DATA MANAGEMENT  
Data from eCRFs and other external data will be entered into an Electronic Data Capture clinical 
database.   These data will be electronically verified through the use of real- time checks 
processed during data entry, and through programmed edit checks as specified in the data management plan.  Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinic al team 
and investigational site personnel, if necessary, in the form of an electronic data query.   
Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database and an audit trial within the system will track all queries and changes made to the data.   Quality control audit(s) will be performed.  
12.1. Coding  
Concomitant medications will be assigned a code using the version of the World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary (version June 2015 or higher) drug codes specified in the data management plan (version June 2015 or higher).  Concomitant medications will be further coded to the appropriate Anatomical -Therapeutic- Chemical (ATC) code indicating therapeutic 
classification.   A listing of concomitant medications by [CONTACT_12399] R for this protocol.  
AEs will be classified into standardized terminology from the verbatim description (investigator

increase gastric pH on tazemetostat PK. 
This study will provide a point estimate and associated 90% confidence intervals on the 
magnitude of the effect of the perpetrator drugs on the PK of the victim drugs.  The default no effect boundary of 80 – 125% for the 90% confidence interval for an effect size will be used as a reference. This is equivalent to a hypothesis test with a null hypothesis that there is a nonzero effect and alternative of no effect.   If the 90% confidence interval for any effect tested in this 
study falls completely within 80 – 125%, it will be concluded that no clinically significant differences are present.   The operating characteristics of this hypothesis test depend on the 
underlying within- subject correlation of subsequent measurements of the same PK parameter. If 
subsequent measurements  of tazemetostat AUC have a correlation of at least 0.885, this test is 
powered at 80% or higher (results from simulation assuming standard deviation of log AUC = 0.5149 from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]). Assuming the null hypothesis of this test is assumed to be >±5% effect, the simulated alpha level is 0.006. 
The precision in the confidence limits is difficult to succinctly characterize given the unknown 
intra-subject variability and the exponential transformation. The corresponding hypothesis test to 
the 90% CI has at least 93% power for the alternative of doubling (or halving) of the tazemetostat AUC, assuming within -subject correlation of at least 0.8.

 13.3. Data Analysis Considerations 
13.3.1 Analysis Populations 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT)  population will consist of all subjects  who receive at least one dose 
of tazemetostat.  The ITT population will be used for summaries and analys es of the efficacy 
endpoints. 
The Safety population  will consist of all subjects in the ITT  population who receive at least one 
dose of IP and have at least one postdose  safety observation recorded. The Safety population will 
be used for summaries and analys es of the safety and tolerability.  
The Pharmacoki netic (PK) population will include all subjects in the ITT population who have 
sufficient postdose  samples collected to allow estimation of the PK parameters.  The PK 
population will be used for PK  summaries and analys es. 
The Pharmaco geno mic (PGx) population will include all subjects in the PK population from 
whom PGx results are available. The P Gx population will be used for summary of PK 
parameters by [CONTACT_12400]. 
13.3.2 Interim Analyses  
Interim analyses will not be performed.   
13.3.3 Key Elements of the Analysis Plan 
The statistical analyses will be performed on log -transformed PK parameters.  The log -
transformed PK parameters will be analyzed by [CONTACT_12359] (ANOVA).  The ANOVA 
will use a mixed -effects model w ith treatment as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. 
The anti -logs of the confidence limits of the 90% CI for the difference in the treatment means of 
the log -transformed data are a 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means between the test and 
reference treatment.  The geometric least squares (adjusted) mean and associated 90% CI for the 
test treatment to reference treatment ratio of adjusted geometric means will be provided after 
transformation of the results from the log -transformed analysis back  to the original scale.  
Complete details of the analysis plan will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  Any 
deviations from, or additions to, the original analysis plan in this protocol will be documented in the SAP and the CSR.

of time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented disease 
progression or death due to any cause, using disease- appropriate standardized response criteria.  
The duration of response ( DOR ) will be calculated for each subject with a  CR or PR (lymphoma) 
or confirmed CR or PR  (solid tumors) . A listing of DOR will be provided. 
Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of subjects achieving CR  or PR, or SD 
lasting 24 weeks  since start of treatment until disease progression or the start of subsequent anti-
cancer therapy . The DCR will be summarized in a similar manner as overall response rate and 
duration.  
Overall survival ( OS) is defined as the interval of time between the date of the first dose of 
tazemetostat and the date of death due to any cause.  For subjects surviving a t the time of the OS 
analysis, the time of death will be censored at the date of last contact.  OS will be calculated using 
the Kaplan -Meier method. If there are a sufficient number of deaths at the time of the analysis, 
median OS, first and third quartiles, and 90% CI (Brookmeyer- Crowley method) will be 
summarized. A figure and listing of OS will also be provided.

 Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_12361]. Data on disease status in subjects 
enroll ed in this study will be listed . 
13.6. Safety Analyses 
13.6.1 Extent of Exposure 
The data on exposure to tazemetostat will be listed.  Details pertaining to dose interruption or 
dose modification will also be listed.  
13.6.2 Adverse Events  
The data listings of AEs in the C SR will contain the verbatim description, preferred t erm, and 
SOC MedDRA- level terms.  
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined by [CONTACT_12402] -emergent signs and 
symptoms (TESS) philosophy. AEs will be regarded as TEAEs if one of the following conditions is met:  
• Emerge after the time of first dose ad ministration, having been absent prior to the first 
dose. 
• Re-emerge, having been present but stopped prior to the time of first dose administration. 
• Worsen in severity after the time of first dose administration relative to the pre -treatment 
state, when the AE is continuous. 
An AE with partial or completely missing start date and/or time will always be assumed as TEAE, unless it can be determined to be “prior to administration” from the incomplete start date/time or resolution date/time (e.g., month, year is before first administration date, or resolution date is before first administration date).  
Only TEAEs will be summarized. Summaries of TEAEs will consist of the number and percentage of subjects reporting the AE by [CONTACT_1753] . TEAEs which occur 
more than once for a subject will be counted only once in the subject frequencies. TEAEs with 
different CTCAE grades for a subject will be counted at the worst (highest) grade for the same SOC (likewise for preferred term ). TEAEs with different drug relationship for a subject will be 
counted at strongest relationship for the same SOC (likewise for preferred term ). TEAEs with 
missing relationship to study treatment will be counted as “related”.  TEAEs with missing 
CTCAE grade will be counted as Grade 3 (“severe”).

13.6.3 Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
All clinical laboratory parameters will be standardized according to the International System of Units (SI) prior to summarization.  Separate listings and summary tables (by [CONTACT_12404]) will be produced for each laboratory test group (complete blood counts, serum chemistries (liver, renal [with creatinine clearance, if creatinine is abnormal] and metabolism), coagulation profile, and urinalysis). 
Complete blood counts, serum chemistries and coagulation will be summarized at each planned 
visit assessment, and  for change from baseline using descriptive statistics (mean, S TD, median, 
minimum , and maximum).  Categorical values will be summarized using number of observations 
and percentages (urinalysis assessment). 
Low, normal, and high (LNH) classifications will be applied to determine whether the laboratory 
test value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) its reference range. Shifts from baseline in LNH classification and clinically significant findings for each parameter will be summarized by [CONTACT_12405]- baseline visit. The summary will include the worst-
case shift from baseline during the post-baseline period, which will include both planned (scheduled) and unscheduled visits after the first dose of study drug. Subjects with labo ratory 
data outside the normal range will be flagged as “L” (Low) or “H” (High) in the data listing.

 Lymph nodes and 
extralymphatic sites  
 Score 1, 2, or 3 * with or without a residual 
mass on 5PS†  
It is recognized that in Waldeyer’s ring or extranodal  sites with high physiologic uptake 
or with activation within spleen or marrow (eg, with chemotherapy or myeloid colony-stimulating factors), uptake may be greater 
than normal mediastinum and/or liver. In this 
circumstance, complete metabolic response may be inferred if uptake at sites of initial 
involvement is no greater than surrounding normal tissue even if the tissue has high physiologic uptake
 
 Target nodes/nodal masses must regress to < 1.5 cm in LDi  
No extralymphatic sites of disease  
 
Nonmeasured  lesion  Not applicable  
 Absent  
Organ enlargement  Not applicable  
 Regress to normal

Partial    Partial metabolic response  Partial remission (all of the 
f i)  Lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites
 
 Score 4 or 5† with reduced uptake compared 
with baseline and residual mass(es) of any size 
At interim, these findings suggest responding disease  
 At end of treatment, these findings indicate 
residual disease > 50% decrease in SPD of up to 
[ADDRESS_11897], assign 5 mm x 5 mm 
as the default value  
When no longer visible, 0 x 0 mm  
For a node > 5 mm x 5 mm,  but 
smaller than normal, use actual 
measurement for calculation  
 
Nonmeasured lesions  Not applicable  Absent/normal, regressed, but no increase
 
 
Organ enlargement  Not applicable  Spleen must have regressed by > 
50% in length beyond normal  
 
New lesions  None  None  
tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -[ADDRESS_11898]-Based  Response  
Bone marrow  Residual uptake higher than uptake in 
normal marrow but reduced compared with 
baseline (diffuse uptake compatible with 
reactive changes from chemotherapy 
allowed). If there are persistent focal changes in the marrow in the context of a nodal response, cons ideration should be 
given to further evaluation with MRI or biopsy or an interval scan  Not applicable  
No response or stable 
disease  No metabolic response  Stable disease  
Target nodes/nodal 
masses, extranodal 
lesions  Score 4 or 5 with no significant change  in 
FDG uptake from baseline at interim or end of treatment < 50% decrease from baseline in 
SPD of up to 6 dominant, measurable nodes and extranodal 
sites; no criteria for progressive 
disease are met  
Nonmeasured lesions  Not applicable  No increase consistent with 
progression  
Organ enlargement  Not applicable  No increase consistent with 
progression  
New lesions  None  None  
Bone marrow  No change from baseline  Not applicable  
Progressive disease  Progressive metabolic disease  Progressive disease requires at 
least 1 of the following:   
Individual target 
nodes/nodal masses  Score 4 or 5 with an increase in intensity of 
uptake from baseline and/or  [COMPANY_003] progression  
Extranodal lesions  Score 4 or 5 with an increase in intensity of 
uptake from baseline and/o  An individual node/lesion must be 
abnormal with: LDi >  1.5 cm  and 
Increase by > 50% from [COMPANY_003] nadir and  
An increase in LDi or SDi from nadir
 
0.5 cm for lesions ≤ 2 cm  
1.0 cm for lesions > [ADDRESS_11899] increase by > 
50% of the extent of its prior increase beyond  baseline  (eg, a 
15-cm spleen must  increase  to > 
16 cm). If no prior splenomegaly, must increase by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_11900]-Based  Response  
New lesions  New FDG -avid foci consistent with 
lymphoma rather than another etiology 
(eg, infection, inflammation). If uncertain regarding etiology of new lesions, biopsy 
or interval scan may be considered  
 Regrowth of previously resolved 
lesions  
A new node > 1.5 cm in any axis  
A new extranodal site > 1.0 cm in any axis; if < 1.[ADDRESS_11901] be attributable to lymphoma 
Assessable disease of any size 
unequivocally attributable to 
lymphoma  
 
Bone marrow  New or recurrent FDG -avid foci  New or recurrent involvement  
Abbreviations: 5PS = 5 -point scale; CT = computed tomography; FDG = fluorodeoxyglucose; IHC = 
immunohistochemistry; LDi  = longest transverse diameter of a lesion; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; 
PET = positron emission tomography; [COMPANY_003] = cross product of the LDi and perpendicular diameter; SDi = shortest axis perpendicular to the LDi; SPD = sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters for multiple lesions.  
 
*A score of [ADDRESS_11902] treatment, especially if at the time of an 
interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where de -escalation is investigated, it may be preferable to 
consider a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid undertreatment). Measured dominant lesions: Up to [ADDRESS_11903] dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in 2 
diameters. Nodes should preferabl y be from disparate regions of the body and should include, where applicable, 
mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions include those in solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, 
lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on p alpation. Nonmeasured lesions: Any disease not 
selected as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable disease should be considered not measured. These 
sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable o r that do not 
meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, 
which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, 
including pleural effusi ons, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions 
that cannot be confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_9661]. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, 
bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the me diastinum with complete metabolic response, but 
should be no higher than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (eg, with marrow activation as a result of 
chemotherapy or myeloid growth factors).  
 
†PET 5PS: 1 = no uptake above background; 2 = uptake < media stinum; 3 = uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver; 
4 = uptake moderately > liver; 5 =   uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions; X = new areas of 
uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma.

 APPENDIX 2:  RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID 
TUMORS  
Tumor response assessments in this clinical trial will utilize Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) based on the following 2009 article:   Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, Schwartz LH, Sargent D, Ford R, et al. New response 
evaluation criteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Eur J Cancer. 2009;45(2):228-47.  The modifications to RECIST 1.1 to be implemented in this trial are: 1) chest x -rays may not be 
used to follow disease; only CT scans may be used to follow chest disease, and 2) the minimum duration of stable disease (or non- CR/non -PD for subjects with nontarget lesions only) is [ADDRESS_11904] dose of study drug.  The Eisenhauer article, published in the European Journal of Cancer, is available online at: http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959804908008733

 APPENDIX 4: NYHA FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM 
 
The [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification: Class I, II, III, or IV 
Heart Failure provides a simple way of classifying the extent of heart failure.  It places subjects 
in one of 4 categories based on the level of limitation experienced during physical activity.  
Clas s Symptoms  
Class I  
(Mild)  No limitation of physical activity.  Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue 
fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332] , or dyspnea (shortness of breath).  
Class II  
(Mild)  Slight limitation of physical activity.  Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical 
activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332] , or dyspnea.  
Class III  
(Moderate)  Marked limitation of physical activity.  Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary 
physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332] , or dyspnea.  
Class IV  
(Seve re) Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort.  Symptoms of cardiac 
insufficiency at rest.  If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

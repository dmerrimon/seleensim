Research Synopsis  
Study title - Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186806] 910 versus monocryl for laceration repair: a randomized trial  
Study Population – recently postpartum women who delivered at Virginia Commonwealth University 
Labor and Delivery with a fir st or second degree laceration or epi[INVESTIGATOR_186808] – Prospective, randomized  
Sample Size – 400 
Study Duration – 24 months  
Primary Objective – dyspareunia  
Secondary Objectives – perineal pain  
 
Background and Significance  
Obstetric pe rineal trauma is a worldwide problem impacting approximately 85% of women having 
vaginal deliveries with at least two -thirds requiring perineal repair.  The associated pain and discomfort 
can have a great impact on a woman in the immediate post partum time  period while she adjusts to the 
demands of caring for a newborn.  Not uncommonly this pain can persist for several months and 20% 
may experience long -term problems with persistent pain and dyspareunia.  It is important to minimize 
the negative effects of perineal lacerations by [CONTACT_186820].  
Sutures are used to close the wound, minimize bleeding, prevent infection and promote healing.  
Various sutures have been used to reap proximate perineal lacerations.  The ideal suture choice would 
have minimal tissue reactivity and be absorbed once the wound has healed to prevent tissue scarring 
and inflammatory reaction.  Suture that remains in place longer than needed may impair healin g leading 
to wound infection and breakdown or scarring with subsequent pain.  A variety of suture materials have 
been used to close perineal lacerations, including catgut, absorbable braided and monofilament 
materials, and newer rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186809].  
Catgut suture is made from collagen derived from the intestines of sheep and cows and is reported to 
cause an increased inflammatory response in the tissues due to the fact that it is broken down by 
[CONTACT_186821] (Irvin 1981) .  Chromic catgut suture is treated with chromate salts 
to slow down the absorption process and decrease the inflammatory response.  A Cochrane review of 
[ADDRESS_220757] sutures with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186810] (five trials) and monofilament sutures 
(one trial).  In the comparison of st andard synthetic with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186811], short - and long -term 
pain were similar.  One trial found those with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186812] [ADDRESS_220758] bee n no studies to date comparing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186813].  
The purpose of this study is to compare monofilament suture with the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186806] 910.  
We will compare pain, rate of dyspareunia, and overall sexual function.   
Objectives:  
Primary Objective  
To evaluate the rates of dyspareunia using a female sexual function index -6 survery with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186814] 910 compared to monocryl.  
 
Secondary Objectives  
To assess overall perineal pain using a pain scale.  
To a ssess overall sexual function.  
 
Study design/methodology:  
 This randomized controlled trial will be conducted and VCU medical center comparing 2 types of 
suture: rapid polyglactin 910 (Vicryl Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328]) and monofilament (Monocryl) for first and second -degree  
lacerations or uncomplicated epi[INVESTIGATOR_186815].  Patients will be enrolled in the study 
immediately after vaginal delivery if a laceration occurs spontaneously or if epi[INVESTIGATOR_186816].  
Patients will be randomized to one of the [ADDRESS_220759] 
prescriptions that are routinely dispensed to all postpartum patients including ibuprofen 600mg every 6 
hours and oxycodone 5mg and acetaminophen 325mg every 4 hours to be used as needed.  
 Pain will be evaluated using a pain scale at 6 week telephone interview.   At three months 
postpartum another telephone interview will be conducted and six questions  of the Female Sexual 
Function Index will be asked.  
 
Study Population:  
Inclusion criteria include English speaking patients with first and second degree spontaneous lacerations 
or those with midline or mediolateral epi[INVESTIGATOR_186817], and hemodynamically 
stable patients.   
Exclusion crite ria include non -english speaking women without laceration or with third or fourth degree 
lacerations.  
 
Study Duration/ Study Timeline:  
Stage 1 – Enrolling patients and randomization  
Stage 2 – follow up at 6 weeks and 3 months  
Stage 3 – data analysis  
Stage  4 – presentation and publication  
 
Projected start date: 8/2014  
Total length of time: 36 months  
Approximate end date: 8/2017  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan:  
A chi square analysis and Fisher's exact test will be used for data analysis.   
A goal sample size of [ADDRESS_220760] deviation of 1, with a 15% loss to follow up, we would be able to detect a 
difference in pain scores of 0.[ADDRESS_220761] to follow up after their 6 week visit, this 
data will be included in the analysis.  
 
Informed Consent Proce ss:  
Informed consent will be obtained after delivery, prior to laceration repair.   
 
Privacy and confidentiality:  
Subject’s names will be kept on a password protected database and will be linked only with a study 
identification number for this research. There are no patient identifiers. All data will be entered into a 
computer that is password protected.  
 
Risk/Benefit:  
Risk to participants: This study does not present any risks to the participants.  
Benefits to Participants: This study does not present any direct benefit to the participants.  However the 
study does provider an opportunity to gain a better understanding of suture maternal that can 
potentially minimize pain and dyspareunia that will benefit women undergoing vaginal delivery and 
laceration repair in years to come.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring:  
A mid -point statistical analysis will be performed to ensure patient safety  
 
Conflict of Interest:  
The principal and co -investigators have no conflicts of interest to report.

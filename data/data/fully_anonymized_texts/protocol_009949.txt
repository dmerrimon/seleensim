Heat Therapy versus Exercise Training in Hypertension  
IRB # 05042018.006  
RESEARCH SUMMARY  
A. Introduction and Background   
Protocol 1:  
In the [LOCATION_002], hypertension (HTN) accounts for more cardiovascular disease (CVD) related 
deaths than any other modifiable CVD risk factor, second only to cigarette smoking as a preventable 
cause of death for any reason1. In fact, in 2010, high blood pressure was the leading cause of death 
and disability -adjusted life years worldwide2,3. According to the CDC, about 75  million American adults 
(32%) have high blood pressure, and about [ADDRESS_834684] pre -HTN. Based on very 
recently published new guidelines on the prevention and management of hypertension by [CONTACT_626399]/American Heart Ass ociation Task Force on hypertension4, the percent of people 
in the [LOCATION_002] with HTN are even higher with the new classification. Lifestyle and exercise 
interventions are considered a first -line preventative against the development of HTN and in the 
treatment of diagnosed HTN. Unfortuna tely, the vast majority of people are reticent to initiate exercise 
training or have poor compliance. Additionally, some patient groups are not able to perform exercise 
due to a number of limitations or are not able to obtain the full benefits of exercise to lower  CVD risk. 
Thus, alternative non -pharmacological options to lower blood pressure and improve CVD risk are 
critically needed. Heat therapy, in the form of hot bath or sauna, is an ancient practice that has recently 
regained attention in the prevention and t reatment of CVD. A recent 20+  year prospective cohort study 
from Finland, in which sauna use is extremely common and part of the culture, has demonstrated that 
regular sauna use was associated with reduced risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_398317]5, which may have 
explained in part the reduced rates of all -cause cardiovascular deaths and reduced rates of Alzheimer’s 
Disease and other memory -related disorders with regular sauna use previously reported in the larger 
cohort6. We recently demonstrated in young, normotensive sedentary subjects that heat therapy in the 
form of hot  water immersion lowered resting blood pressure and greatly improved numerous 
biomarkers of cardiovascular health including endothelial function and arterial stiffness7. We have pi[INVESTIGATOR_626375], potentially through a profound reduction in sympathetic neural 
outflow and improvements in arterial com pliance. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest 
improvements in blood pressure are greater  than observed with the idealized standard of care, aerobic 
exercise training.  
Protocol 2:  
Protocol [ADDRESS_834685] quality of life and 
predisposes individuals to age -related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and 
its related dementias (ADRD). As the population of m iddle -aged and older adults is increasing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], 
there is increasing need to understand the mechanisms of cognitive aging.  Aging exerts direct effects 
on the heart that increase our susceptibility of developi[INVESTIGATOR_179558]8, including HTN.  However, the largest 
portion of the marked increase in CVD risk with advancing age is driven by [CONTACT_626400]: increases in systolic arterial blood pressure (SBP) and vascular dysfunction9. These events are 
Research Summary #05042018.006   Approved by [CONTACT_1744]: 3.15.[ADDRESS_834686]. 
Importantly, it has been  reported that the frequency of  sauna bathing  was associated with lowered risks 
of dementia and Alzheimer's disease10. The  results of  these studies suggest that heat therapy may 
reduce the risk of hypertension and dementia  either  independently or through reductions in systolic 
blood pressur e but  are confounded by [CONTACT_626401], education and discretionary time.  The effects of heat  therapy on cardiovascular health 
and cognitive function are best determined by  [CONTACT_626402] . Notably, women were 
not included in previous studies,  and we have substantial preliminary  data demonstrating that women 
are showing all of the same benefits of heat therapy as men.  Heat therapy represents a possible 
lifestyle intervention that , as our preliminary findings suggest, may be more effective in lowering systolic 
blood pressure and reducing arterial stiffness  than aerobic exercise training, which is known to 
slow/delay the development of normal cognitive aging.  Therefore, the purpose  of Protocol [ADDRESS_834687] risk.  
 
B. Specific Aims/Study Objectives  
Protocol 1:  
The overarching goal of this research is to perform a clinical trial to determine whether heat therapy 
improves blood pressure and vascular health in HTN.  
Specific Aim 1:  Utilizing a prospective randomized clinical trial study design, we will determine whether 
heat therapy improves blood pressure (both in clinic and ambulatory) better than dynamic aerobic 
exercise, the gold -standard non -pharmacological treatment of essenti al HTN. Specifically, we 
hypothesize that 30 sessions of passive heat therapy using hot water immersion over 8 -10 weeks will 
improve blood pressure in HTN individuals to a greater extent than 30 sessions of exercise training 
over the same time period.  
Specific Aim 2:  We will determine whether heat therapy will improve biomarkers of arterial health and 
compare responses to exercise training. We hypothesize that 30 sessions of heat therapy will improve 
arterial stiffness  in HTN to a greater extent than exercise. Furthermore, we hypothesize key clinical 
biomarkers of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress will be improved following heat therapy.  
Specific Aim 3:  In an exploratory aim, we will determine whether the acute decreases in blood 
pressure following an initial heat therapy session or exercise peak test predict the sustained reduction 
in resting blood pressures following heat therapy treatment or exercise training in HTN. These findings 
would provide significant predictive information beyond baseline resting blood pressures. We 
hypothesize that the reduction in blood pressure following acute stressors will be predictive of treatment 
effects o n resting blood pressure.  
Protocol 2:  
The overarching goal of this research is to determine whether 30 sessions of heat therapy or exercise 
training  (performed by [CONTACT_626403] 1)  improves cognitive function (using the NIH Toolbox : 
http://www.nihtoolbox.org ) and MRI -based markers of aging and Alzheimer’s risk (using specific MRI -
based biomarkers and tests).  
Subjects enrolled in Protocol [ADDRESS_834688]  before and after heat therapy or exercise 
training. Subjects will not be able to enroll in Protocol 2 without enrolling and participating in Protocol 1; 
this is required as Protocol [ADDRESS_834689] risk performed before and following the heat therapy and exercise interventions detailed in 
Protocol 1. Protocol 2  will include completing the NIH Toolbox for cognitive function , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_626376] (PSQI),  and MRI scans at the Lewis Center for Neuroimaging (LCNI).  
Research Summary #05042018.006   Approved by [CONTACT_1744]: 3.15.202 3-3.14.2024  Page 3 Specific Aim 1:  These studies in mid -life adults will determine if heat therapy can be used to improve 
cognitive aging and dementia risk, with potentially important clinical implications for the prevention of 
ADRD.  
Demonstrating that heat therapy can be used as a novel treatment for essential hypertension is timely 
and important as there is a clear need for alternatives to exercise training and pharmacological 
approaches. As HTN is linked to ADRD risk, these studies will allow us to link outcome measures in 
Protocol 1 (focused on CVD risk) with Protocol 2 (focused on ADRD risk) before and after subjects 
undergo heat therapy or exercise intervention in Protocol 1. The proposed studies are innovative and 
include an inte ntion -to-treat randomized clinical trial and detailed high -resolution phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_626377]. Overall, this work 
advances a novel treatment option for those with HTN and in the prevention of CVD  and ADRD .  
 
No devices are being studied for safety or effectiveness.  Instruments are used for data collection 
purposes  only.  
 
C. Methods, Materials and Analysis  
Protocol 1:  
We will address our aims in a randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of heat therapy versus 
aerobic exercise training. This is a well -controlled, clinically relevant  approach, as we will be comparing 
our novel heat therapy intervention directly to the current idealized standard of care, aerobic  exercise. 
We will specifically study individuals with Elevated  Blood Pressure  and Stage 1  or 2 HTN, in the 
absence of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or strokes, diabetes, or chronic kidney disea se, 
as current guidelines4 do not mandate prescribing medications to these individuals. They are the ideal 
target group for the proposed intervention, as it has the potential to obviate the need for life -long 
pharmacological therapy.

RECRUIT: The trial will be conducted in a cohort of physically 
inactive to moderately active men and women with high blood 
pressure (Elevated and Stage 1  or 2 Hypertension , based on 
current guidelines)4 from the local Eugene and Springfield, OR communities  (details under section 
D). Potential subjects will be pre -screened by  [CONTACT_626404].  
PRE-SCREEN: Candidates  will complete a pre -screening consent and answer pre -screening 
questions  online and over the phone. If candidates appear to qualify, they will be further screened 
for eligibility over the phone using the IPAQ.  
SCREEN:  Subjects will need to come to the laboratory on two separate occasions as part of the 
initial screening process. Seated blood pressure will be measured on two separate screening visits 
to determine resting blood pressure . During  each visit, blood pressure will be measured twice, 
performed according to clinical guidelines for assessing hypertension4. The average b lood pressure 
of these four readings obtained over two assessments must fall within the inclusion criteria range to 
qualify for inclusion in the study . If the average blood pressure of these four readings (two obtained 
during Screening Day 1 and two obtained during Screening Day 2) does not fall within the allowable 
limits for this study, the subject will be excluded from the study. During  Screening Day [ADDRESS_834690] will be  pre-screened using the MRI PRE -SCREENING FORM, 
LCNI MRI SAFETY SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE  and MMSE . Subjects who undergo screening 
and satisfy all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study and  progress to 
a battery of pre -intervention tests (PRE -TESTS).  
PRE-TESTS:  Before and after the INTERVENTION, we will conduct high -resolution phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_626379]: lab -based hemodynamic tests of vascular function; blood -based 
biomarkers related to cardiovascular health; 24-h urine collection ; 24-h food/beverage log ; 24-h 
ambulatory blood pressure recording; VO 2peak fitness test . These are detailed below Specific 
Experimental Approaches .  
ASSIGN: Subjects will be randomized to either the heat therapy group or exercise training group, 
then undergo 30 sessions of the specific intervention at a rate of 3 -4 per week over an 8 to 10 -week 
period. Randomization will be  stratified by [CONTACT_626405]. Further stratification, for example by [CONTACT_626406], would be difficult given 
the small  sample size. (More details of the randomization process are under  Randomization ). After 
the first 15 session s, subjects will be re -tested for hemodynamic and biomarker adaptations to the 
intervention (INTERIM -TEST). After [ADDRESS_834691] -TESTS.  
INTERVENTION:  Subjects in the  heat therapy  group will report to the lab to undergo heat therapy  
sessions 3 -4 times per week , with 45 minutes of hot water immersion per session . The goal of heat 
therapy is to maintain core temperature above 38.5°C for at least [ADDRESS_834692] tolerated this heating protocol very well. Subjects will be checked for 
euhydration prior to entering the tub and will be monitored closely throughout heating for heart rate 
and blood pressure during all sessions. In addition, core temperature (T core,; FDA approved  
ingestible core temp sensing pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ; Accutemp Temperature Monitoring System by [CONTACT_626407]. ) will be 
monitored during the first 5 and final sessions whereas aural temperature may be monitored in all 
sessions. Subjects will be rem oved from the hot bath if T core exceeds 39.5°C. Water immersion is 
the preferred method of heating since it is capable of increasing core temperature and heart rate at 
a rate similar to moderate -intensity exercise12. Subjects in the exercise training group will report to 
the lab for a supervised exercise training session [ADDRESS_834693] -TESTS

peak, followed by 40 minutes of cycling at 60%  VO 2 peak, then a 5 -minute cool down at 30%.  In 
addition, core temperature will be monitored during the first and final sessions.  On the 1st heat

INTERIM -TESTS: After half the intervention sessions have been completed, we will repeat our 
assessment of hemodynamic tests, 24-h urine collection  and food/beverage log, 24-h ambulatory 
blood pressure  and sleep/wake/activity log , and blood -based biomarkers related to cardiovascular 
health.

supplements (except oral contraceptives) for 12 h, alcohol for 24 h, and exercise or heat therapy for 48 
h prior to testing. For the EXERCISE TESTING, s ubjects will abstain from food for 3 h, caffeine for 6 h, 
alcohol and medications  or supplements  (except oral contraceptives) for [ADDRESS_834706] HEAT THERAPY or TRAINING SESSION, subjects will 
abstain from food for 2 h, caffeine for 6 h, alcohol and medications or supplements (except oral

watch for the color changes associated with a negative (not pregnant) or positive (pregnant) test. These 
tests have been determined to have >99% accura cy. If the test is positive, the volunteer will not be 
allowed to participate and will be encouraged to see their physician or schedule a visit to the Student 
Health Center (if the subject is a UO student). Volunteers with a negative urine pregnancy result  will be 
allowed to participate in the study.  Further, person s who are pregnant, nursing, or desiring to become 
pregnant will be excluded (see section D).   
Volunteers will complete a 3 -page MEDICAL HISTORY FORM  which  includes personal identifying 
information  for use in emergencies (see Emergency Procedures section below). On each study day that 
involves procedures which are considered greater than minimal risk, the subjects will be asked if the 
MEDICAL HISTORY FORM needs to be updated. If so, the original will be replaced with the updated 
form, and the original will be disp osed of as described below. This document will be retained in a locked 
file cabinet in the physiology lab for up to a week after the end of a subject’s participation in the project. 
One week  after the volunteers complete the study, the MEDICAL HISTORY FORM  will be placed in a 
locked confidential documents disposal bin which is emptied by a secure shredding service.  
During the in-person screening, volunteers will complete the CORE TEMP ERATURE  PI[INVESTIGATOR_626383]. If a contraindication is 
identified, rectal thermistors will be used instead of core temperature pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].  
Randomization. As indicated above, subjects will be randomized to either the heat therapy group or 
exercise training group. While subjects will not be blind to their treatment group, preliminary analysis of 
data and data entry will be by a blinded researcher (i.e., this will be a partially blind /observer -blind trial). 
The randomization and blinding process will be coordinated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jodi Lapi[INVESTIGATOR_27562] (a biostatistician at 
OHSU who is supporting this project) . In brief, the Research Coordinator will enter age, sex, and 
subject ID number into a web -enabled randomization database via REDCap and  receive the 
randomized group assignment. As indicated above, randomization will be  stratified by [CONTACT_626408]. Further stratification, for example by [CONTACT_626409], would be difficult given the small  sample size.  
Specific Experimental Approaches. The experiments combine our core reseach methods which are 
as follows:  
Research Summary #05042018.006   Approved by [CONTACT_1744]: 3.15.[ADDRESS_834708] initial screening in the laboratory , we will obtain a small  sample  of blood (<1 mL) via finger 
stick using aseptic  technique. From this sample we will measure  fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c , 
and lipid profile to verify eligibility. In addition, we will assess the subject ’s medical history , screen 
for core temperature pi[INVESTIGATOR_626384], measure arm c ircumference,  and perform 
measurements of height and weight to calculate BMI. Person s of childbearing potential will be 
required to have a negative urinary pregnancy test. Additionally, subjects who want to participate in 
Protocol 2 will be screened for MRI eligibility. Subjects who undergo the screenings and satisfy all 
inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will progress to a battery of pre -intervention tests (PRE -
TESTS), to be carried out on three  separate visits.  
Hemodynamic Tests.  To assess hemodynamic changes underlying adaptation to heat therapy and 
exercise training, we will measure resting heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral 
resistance, and arterial stiffness  as follows. These are all well -established methods in our research 
program7–9.  
Heart rate  and blood pressure will be monitored by [CONTACT_626410] [ADDRESS_834709] velocity , as done previously7. 
Tonometry pressure tracings will be  obtained from the common carotid and ipsilateral common 
femoral artery ( all recordings will be performed on the left side of the body) . Time delays 
between pressure tracings will be calculated using the upswing of the pressure tracing22.  
Pulse wave velocity23 will be calculated as the direct distance between the probe and the thigh 
cuff divided by [CONTACT_626411] . 
Biomarkers. Methodology for blood -based biomarkers is well-established in our research program.  
All venous blood samples will be collected into appropriate vacutainers , centrifuged, and 
serum/plasma separated. For purpose of screening, hemoglobin A1C, glucose , and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_626385]’s lab ( Afinion II, Cholestech LDX). All other samples will be 
stored at -80°C until delivery by [CONTACT_626412] 
(OCTRI) at Oregon Health and Science University. OCTRI will analyze samples for fasted glucose 
and insulin (for the calculation of the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA -
IR). Samples collected for meas urement of circulating biomarkers of cardiovascular health (IL -6, C-
reactive protein, oxidized LDL, ET -1) and renal function (angiotensin II, plasma renin activity, 
aldosterone) will also be measured at OCTRI. A reduction in  oxidized LDL will indicate reduced 
oxidative stress. Reduced C -reactive protein will indicate reduced systemic and vascular 
inflammation. HOMA -IR will be calculated using the available on -line calculator from the Oxford 
Center for Diabetes.  Three 40ml blood draws will occur throughout the study immediately following 
the last void of the [ADDRESS_834710] for measuring basal 
kidney function (i.e., creatinine clearance, urinary albumin excretion, urinary sodium excretion). 
Subjects will be given two urine collection containers to take home. In our experience, s ubjects 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_626386] a 24 -hour period. Therefore, the second collection 
Research Summary #05042018.006   Approved by [CONTACT_1744]: 3.15.[ADDRESS_834711] 
void of the 24-hour urine collection.  Urine samples will be analyzed at a later time for osmolality and 
urine biomarkers.  
Food/Beverage Log . We are not specifically controlling the subjects’ dietary patterns with the 
exception of asking them to abstain from caffeine for [ADDRESS_834712] -VASCULAR STUDY  visits. These logs will 
be analyzed to determine total intakes for energy (kilocalories), fat, protein, carbohydrate, sugar, 
dietary fiber, sodium, caffeine, and fluid volume. Pre -, interim -, and post -VASCULAR STUDY  
intakes will be used to compare changes in [ADDRESS_834713] 
pressure every 20 minutes during the daytime and every hour at night. This provides a means to 
study the “real world” impact of chronic exercise on arterial pressure and may be a better predictor 
of cardiovascular morbidit y and mortality. Studies have shown that the prognostic significance of 
ambulatory blood pressure is in general superior to that of office blood pressure in healthy 
populations as well as in untreated and treated hypertensive individuals10,11. Subjects will be given a 
set of instructions and also be asked to complete an activity log during ambulatory blood pressure 
monitoring and record activities performed during each hour of the day, any unusual physical or 
emotional events, and sleep and wak e times. This deidentified activity log will be returned to the 
investigator.  
VO [ADDRESS_834714] their peak aerobic power (VO 2Peak)  and maximal heart rate determined with a graded 
maximal cycle ergometer test. This test will be used to assess changes in aerobic fitness in both 
groups and  will be used to determine exercise prescriptions for the aerobic exercise training 
sessions. VO 2 will be measured using a mixing chamber and mass spectrometer with subjects on 
an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer. Heart rate will be measured by a Polar Heart Rate 
Monitor.  
Heat Therapy.  Passive heating is well -established in our research program7,14. For Heat Therapy 
sessions (Heat Therapy group only), subjects will be immersed in hot water for up to [ADDRESS_834715] is dehydrated (determined by [CONTACT_626413] >1.02 4). 
We will also measure nude body weight before and after the heat exposure. When possible,  this will 
be performed by [CONTACT_626414]. The  scale will be inside a restroom  
with the readout on the outside of the restroom to maximize subject privacy and comfort. During the 
first five and final session of Heat Therapy for each subject, core temperature will be continuously 
monitored and recorded using a wireless, disposable core temperature sensing pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] . After the first [ADDRESS_834716]’s sensitivity to heating has been established, subsequent 
sessions may be monitored with an infrared aural temperature monitor. There are some risks 
associated with heat exposure, including: fatigue, light -headedness, muscle cramps, dehydration, 
and neurological detriments ( i.e., heat stroke).  However, these symptoms do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_626387] 40°C. Subjects will be removed from the hot bath immediately if either 
core temperature reaches 39.5°C or the subjects experience any symptoms of heat -related illness. 
All symptoms subside upon lowering core temperature. Ice packs will be on hand if rapid cooling is 
necessary. Heart rate will also be continuously monitored and recorded throughout heating. If heart 
rate increases >60 beats/min above resting or increases >20 be ats/min with a 5 -min time period, 
Research Summary #05042018.006   Approved by [CONTACT_1744]: 3.15.202 3-3.14.2024  Page 9 subjects will be moved to a seated position if they were previously fully submerged or  removed from 
the hot tub if they were already sitting up.  
Exercise Training . For Exercise Training sessions (Exercise Training group only), subjects will 
report to the lab for a supervised exercise training session [ADDRESS_834717] of a 5 -minute warm -up of seated upright cycling at 
30% of the subject’s VO 2 peak, followed by 40 minutes of cycling at 60% VO 2 peak, then a 5 -minute 
cool down at 30%. There are some risks associated with exercise , including: light-headedness, 
fatigue, muscle cramps, and shortness of breath. Procedures will be terminated immediately if any 
subject feels light -headed, nauseated, or experiences any other adverse signs or symptoms.  
1st Heat Therapy or Exercise T raining  Session.  During the 1st heat therapy or exercise t raining  
session, we will measure the acute post -heating/exercise hypotension response. This information 
will be used to test the predictive power of acute post-heat/ exercise hypotension on the individual 
response to the interventions. The subject will lay supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] [ADDRESS_834718]  will lay down for 1 hour of recovery, during which  we will continue to monitor 
core temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure  every 5 min . 
Protocol 2:  
Upon consenting to Protocol 1, a subset of  subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in 
additional study activities (Protocol 2). We will enroll up to 40 subjects total for Protocol 2; consistent 
with the [ADDRESS_834719] risk. Subjects are not able to enroll in Protoco l 2 without 
enrolling and participating in Protocol 1, in which the interventions (heat therapy and exercise training) 
are detailed. Subjects who consent to participate  in Protocol 2  will undergo two additional experimental 
sessions (additional to those in Protocol 1) at LCNI. The first session will be conducted at baseline, 
before the onset of 30 sessions of heat therapy or exercise training over 8 -10 weeks  (Protocol 1) , and 
will include the PSQI, a short cognitive assessment battery , and the MRI session. The second session 
will take place approximately [ADDRESS_834720] operating procedures for use of the 3 -Tesla 
Siemens Skyra. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are 
approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) to look  at structure and function of the brain 
and body.  
The informed consent for Protocol [ADDRESS_834721] of  complet ing the PSQI , a 20-minute cognitive assessment, and a 1 -hour MRI scan. 
Our battery uses the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function 
(http://www.nihtoolbox.org)  in order to generate an efficient and comprehensive battery of cognitive 
assessmen t. NIH Toolbox is a web -based computerized platform. Subjects will perform tasks as part of 
the ‘Cognitive Domain’ assessment including the ‘Epi[INVESTIGATOR_17120]’ (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_374242]) task and 
‘Working Memory’ (List Sorting) task. In addition, we propose to use a standardized measure of Fluid 
Intelligence appropriate for use across the full age range to be tested.  The NIH Toolbox for Cognitive 
Function is a web -based assessment; we have attached a description and some screenshots from the 
testing (NIH TOOLBOX BROC HURE ). 
After the cognitive assessment, the subject will be escorted to the MRI room in LCNI for the MRI 
assessment following LCNI SOPs. The operator  will communicate with the subject via an intercom 
system between scans to assess level of comfort and willingness to continue, to prompt the subject to 
lie still, and to let the subject know when an upcoming scan will sound differently than the one before .

task assessing memory performance, diffusion imaging, arterial spin label (ASL) and high -resolution T2 
oblique coronal images of the hippocampus. We will als o collect field maps to correct for field 
inhomogeneities. Total scan time is 52 minutes in length.  
Session 2 will be a follow -up repeat of the same measures from session 1  (PSQI , cognitive assessment 
battery , and MRI scan) . It will last no more than 2.[ADDRESS_834723] -intervention differences (i.e., with the fall in pressure following heat therapy being 4.0, 4.5, 
or 5.0 mmHg greater than following exercise training), and using a SD of 4.[ADDRESS_834724] of our outcome variables; thus, powering for blood pressure will allow adequate power for 
numerous measurements giving us a global pi[INVESTIGATOR_626388]. Our 
prospective power estimates based on a simpler model (two -sample RCT design, modeled as a two -
sample t -test), to detect a minimum hypothesized effect size of 0.89 (which is smallest effect size of 
interest across outcome variables; power 90%; =0.05), indi cate the need to enroll 50 subjects (50:50 
ratio of study groups; sample size assumes 20% dropout for the per -protocol analysis).  Of those 
preliminarily screened who appear to be eligible, we will consent and enroll up to 250 individuals for 
further screening for eligibility anticipating only 50 individuals will be eligible for participation  in the 
study. We need 50 study participants to account for rate of attrition once participants are enrolled in the 
formal study to ensure completion of 40 participant needed for statistical purposes.  
 
D. Research Population , Recruitment Methods , and Compensation  
Protocol 1:  
The trial will be conducted in a cohort of 50 physically inactive to moderately active men and women 
with high blood pressure (Elevated , Stage 1, and Stage 2, based on current guidelines)4 from the local 
Eugene and Springfield, OR communities. We will attempt to recruit subjects that represent the 
ethnicity of Eugene, Oregon and the University of Oregon.  
Subjects will be recruited locally (newspaper advertisements, flyers, radio advertisements, in -person 
recruitment events, online posts, as well as Craigslist and other online advertisements  including ad 
campaign s designed and hosted by [CONTACT_626415] ), as well as referred to us by [CONTACT_626416] .  
If candidates encounter an online advertisement, they will be directed to the ONLINE RECRUITMENT 
QUESTIONNAIRE . If the candidate appears to qualify based on this questionnaire, they will have t he 
opportunity to make a phone screening appointment with the Research Coordinator, during which 
candidates will be further screened using the IPAQ.  Candidates  who do not fill out the ONLINE  
RECRUITMENT QUESTIONNAIRE will be  pre-screened by [CONTACT_626417]-SCREENING PHONE SCRIPT  and IPAQ . Subsequently, subjects will be 
screened in -person following our SCREEN ING FORM , MEDICAL HISTORY FORM , and CORE 
TEM PERATURE PI[INVESTIGATOR_626389] . During this screening, we will 
assess medical history, BMI, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c , and lipid profile to verify eligibility. 
Further, seated blood pressure will be measured on two separate screening visits to determine resting 
blood pressure, and in each visit, blood pressure will be measured twice, performed according to 
clinical guidelines for assessing hypertension4. Subjects who undergo the screening and satisfy all 
inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will progress to Protocol  1. 
Inclusion criteria : Systolic blood pressure 120-180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 80-120 mmHg ; 
ages 35-60. 
Research Summary #05042018.006   Approved by [CONTACT_1744]: 3.15.202 3-3.14.2024  Page 11 Exclusion criteria:  Hypertensive crisis or target -organ damage; chronic cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_626390]; abnormal resting or exercise ECG  (self-reported ); 
currently on antihypertensive drugs; obesity Class 2 or greater (BMI ≥35); fasting glucose ≥126; 
hemoglobin A1c ≥7%; LDL ≥160 mg/dL; high level of physical activity based on the IPAQ ; person s 
who are pregnant, nursing,  or currently trying to conc eive. People aged 34 years or younger, or 61 
years and older , will not be eligible to participate in the study.  
Participants will be compensated $ 450 for their inconvenience and time spent in Protocol 1 . 
Participants will be compensated at a rate of $[ADDRESS_834725] visits (9 
hours x $15/hour = $135). Participants will also receive $5 per heat therapy or exercise training session 
(30 sessions x $5/session = $150), $45 for each 24 -hour urine collection/24 -hour BP (3 collections x 
$45 = $135), and an additional $30 bonus for completion of all the sessions within 10 weeks. Thus, 
$450 is the total amount listed in the consent form. If a participant starts an experiment but stops before 
the experiment is completed, the amount of money the y receive will be prorated at a rate of $15 per 
research testing hour, $5 per heat therapy or exercise training session, and $45 per 24 -hour urine 
collection/24 -hour BP that they complete.  
Protocol 2:  
At the time when  subjects consent to participate in Protocol 1, they will be told about the opportunity to 
particpate in Protocol 2. If subject s are interested in participating in Protocol 2, the consent process for 
Protocol 2 will be completed on Screening Day 2. Then subjects will be pre -screened using the MRI 
PRE-SCREENING FORM, LCNI MRI SAFETY SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE  and MINI -MENTAL 
STATE EXAMINATION (MMSE) . If subjects consent to Protocol 2, they will be scheduled for their first 
cognitive function battery and MRI scan before starting therapy sessions , and they will be scheduled for 
the second cognitive function battery and MRI scan after 8 -10 weeks of heat or exercise  therapy . It is 
understood that for various reasons (lack of time, contraindications for MRI, etc.) not all subjects who 
participate in Protocol  1 will be able or willing to participate in Protocol 2. For this reason we will attempt 
to recruit up to 40 subjects for Protocol 2.  
Inclusion criteria : Meets the inclusion criteria for Protocol 1 and has consented to participate in 
Protocol 1.  Right handed.  
Exclusion criteria : Does not meet the exclusion criteria for Protocol 1  or is cognitively impaired ( <24 
score on MMSE) . Additionally, anyone who may have non -removable metal items imbedded in their 
body or is determined to be ineligible based on the results of  the LCNI MRI Safety Screening 
Questionnaire  or the opi[INVESTIGATOR_626391] , will be excluded from Protocol 2.  Left 
handed.  
 
Left-handers have different functional brain patterns for language and other cognitive processes and 
therefore must be excluded for any functional brain imaging studies including Protocol 2 of this study.  
 
Subjects who participate in Protocol 2 will be compensated $[ADDRESS_834726] rate for 1 -hour of scans and associated cognitive testing. Participants will  
receive payment after completion of MRI scanning and cognitive assessments.  
 
E. Informed Consent Procedure  
Pre-Screening : Pre-Screening will be conducted  in one of two ways: 1.) via an online  questionnaire  
and phone, or 2.) via phone only  as described below.  Candidates will be given ample time to consider 
whether or not to participate in the pre -screening  and provided with the research team ’s contact 
[CONTACT_626418].  
1.) Via online questionnaire and phone: Candidates who encounter the ONLINE  RECRUITMENT 
QUESTIONNAIRE will read and sign a  pre-screening consent  electronicall y. Once signed, the 
questions on the  ONLINE  RECRUITMENT QUESTIONNAIRE will populate and the candidate will fill in 
their answers. If the candidate’s answers match the inclusion criteria and do not match the exclusion 
Research Summary #05042018.006   Approved by [CONTACT_1744]: 3.15.202 3-3.14.2024  Page 12 criteria , the candidate will be given the opportunity to make an appointment for a phone screening  with 
the Research Coordinator. During the phone screening, the Research Coordinator will read the study 
description from the PRE -SCREENING PHONE SCRIPT and answer any of the candidate’s questions 
before further screened for eligibility using the IPAQ. This phone screening will take about [ADDRESS_834727] for 
Protocol 1 and 2.  If the candidate’s answers to the ONLINE RECRUITMENT QUESTIONNAIRE  do not 
match the inclusion criteria or match the exclusion criteria, the  questionnaire will end and the candidate 
will be informed that they are not eligible for the study. If the candidate does not sign the PRE-
SCREENING CONSENT , the RECRUITMENT QUESTIONNAIRE  will end. 
2.) Via phone only:  Candidates who do NOT  encounter the ONLINE  RECRUITMENT 
QUESTIONNAIRE will be pre -screened by [CONTACT_626419] -
SCREENING PHONE SCRIPT. Candidates will be read the PRE-SCREENING CONSENT  and will 
consent  to the pre -screening  verbally. The Research Coordinator  will document that the candidate has 
verbally consented  before administering the RECRUITMENT QUESTIONNAIRE and IPAQ  verbally . 
The phone screening (including the pre -screening consent process) will take about 30 minutes.  
Due to the inability to obtain written consent over the phone, a  waiver of consent documentation  
is requested to obtain verbal but not written consent for th e pre -screening if it occurs  over the 
phone.  This waiver is not required if candidates complete the ONLINE  RECRUITMENT 
QUESTIONNAIRE which  is capable of collecting  electronic signature s. The pre -screening 
activities conducted over the phone represent only minimal risk (i.e., the probability and 
magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of 
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine 
physical or psychol ogical examinations or tests ). Additionally, t he pre -screening procedures 
would not normally require signed consent outside of the research context .  
Electronic signatures for the  pre-screening consent  and ONLINE RECRUITMENT QUESTIONNAIRE 
answers will be collected in REDCap, a highly secure data management system.  If candidates do not 
consent to the pre -screening, no information will be retained about the candidate. If candidates consent 
to the pre -screening but fail  the pre -screening, their information will be retained only if they indicated 
that they want to be notified about future studies they may qualify for. Otherwise, their information will 
be del eted.  
Screening Day 1: Written informed consent for Protocol [ADDRESS_834728] at the 
beginning of Screening Day 1 . Informed consent is obtained by [CONTACT_38733] : 1) Subject will 
review the PROTOCOL 1 INFORMED CONSENT FORM , 2) PIs, researchers, or staff will meet with the 
subject to review the PROTOCOL [ADDRESS_834729]’s 
understanding, and answer any questions, 3) Once the investigator or staff member is convinced that 
the subject has read the PROTOCOL 1 INFORMED CONSENT FORM , verbally demonstrates 
understanding, and agrees to the process, the PROTOCOL 1 INFORMED C ONSENT  FORM  will be 
signed in the presence of a witness, 4) The investigator or staff member will sign the PROTOCOL [ADDRESS_834730], 5)  
Consent forms will be kept in a secure file cabinet in the physiology lab  and will be retained for a 
minimum of 5 years after the study is completed .  
Screening  Day 2: If the subject meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet the exclusion criteria for 
Protocol 1,  Protocol [ADDRESS_834731]. If they are interested, consent will be obtained as 
described above (see Screening Day 1) using the PROTOCOL [ADDRESS_834732] their relationship with the primary investigators, researchers, or the University of 
Research Summary #05042018.006   Approved by [CONTACT_1744]: 3.15.[ADDRESS_834733].  
Phone screenings will be scheduled using HIPAA compliant software.  
Heart rate data will be collected with a Polar Team Pro system. The license for this system is shared 
with other groups  (sports teams) at the University of Oregon. Therefore, individuals  outside of the 
physiology lab may have access to heart rate data from subjects in this study. However, all heart rate 
data is coded such that individuals  outside of the physiology lab will have no access to identifiable 
information.  
Blood samples for  biomarkers  will be labeled by [CONTACT_626420] (no name) and either analyzed by [CONTACT_626421] a commer cial lab that will only receive  coded samples with no other identifying information.  
Samples will be kept for five years. After the five years, the samples will be destroyed by [CONTACT_626422] a biohazard waste container to be collected and destroyed by [CONTACT_626423]. Any excess samples will be discarded and destroyed in 
the same manner.  
No identified individual d ata will be presented or published, rather group mean data will serve as the 
basis for comparisons.  Individual data may be shown without identifying the subject to illustrate 
scientific principles. Coded data will be kept either in a locked file cabinet in the physiology  lab or on the 
secure server after the study is completed. Non -identifiable data will be kept in our files indefinitely.  
In order to comply with federal and state tax laws, individuals receiving ≥  $600 in compensation will be 
required to provide appropriate tax identification information to university officials. Tracking of this 
information is a limitation to confidentiality but is clearly disclosed to participants via the consent 
process and form.  
As this study is defined as a clinical trial and is funded by [CONTACT_7681], it has been 
registered with clinicaltrials.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Regular reports will be filed with clinicaltrials.gov as 
required by [CONTACT_626424]. There are no further requirements for data sharing with central NIH 
repositories.  
Data for Protocol 2 will not be stored in REDCap and will be coded and handled as described above.  
Data for Protocol 1  will be stored in the University of Oregon’s (UO)  installation of REDCap, a highly 
secure and robust web -based research data collection and management system. Features of REDCap 
that protect participants' privacy and data security include:  
Research Summary #05042018.006   Approved by [CONTACT_1744]: 3.15.202 3-3.14.2024  Page 14 • Physical Security: UO's REDCap software is housed on servers located in UO’s Information 
Services Computing Center providing locked physical security.  
• Electronic Security: The UO REDCap servers are housed behind the UO Information Services 
Datacenter firewall. All web -based data transmissions are encrypted with industry -standard SSL 
methods.  
• Controlled User Access: REDCap employs a robust multi -level security system that enables 
researchers to easily implement "minimum necessary" data access for their research staff, 
including specification of data fields that are identifiers. This feature inc ludes “single click” ability 
to provide completely deidentified (removing all identified data fields and shifting dates) for 
analysis or other purposes.  User activities are logged to enable auditing of all data access.   
UO access is integrated with UO's Shibboleth Sign -On such that users who are also UO 
employees are authenticated against their UO network credentials.  
• Data Integrity: UO REDCap is hosted on UO Information Services managed datacenter, 
ensuring fidelity of database configuration and back -ups. User activities are logged to enable 
auditing of all data changes.  
Only de -identified data will be shared with researchers outside of the University of Oregon physiology 
lab for the purpose of statistical analysis.  
 
G. Potential R esearch Risks or D iscomforts to Participants  
Protocol 1:  
Risks from participation in these studies are not considered minimal but  are considered low.   
Exercise testing and training. The risks associated with graded exercise testing include light -
headedness, fatigue, shortness of breath, emesis , risk of myocardial infarction and death. According to 
the American College of Sports Medicine, these general statements can be made regarding the safety 
of maximal graded exercise testing and  include the risks for a wide range of clinical conditions . The risk 
of death during or immediately after an exercise test is <0.01%. The risk of myocardial infarction during 
or immediately after an exercise  test is <0.04%. The risk of complication requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(including myocardial infarction) is approximately 0.1%. The magnitude of severity for risks of light -
headedness, fatigue, shortness of breath from the VO [ADDRESS_834734] feels light -headed, nauseated, or 
experiences any other adverse signs or symptoms. See Emergency Procedures section below . The 
probability  of the adverse reactions discussed above is low, and the severity  is low. 
Heat therapy.  Subjects assigned to the heat therapy group will be immersed in hot water on 3 0 
occasions (up to 45  min immersion in a 40.5°C bath ). There  are some risks associated with heat 
exposure, including: fatigue, light -headedness, muscle cramps, dehydration, and neurological 
detriments ( i.e., heat stroke). However, these symptoms do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_626392] 40°C. Core temperature will be continuously monitored and recorded during the first [ADDRESS_834735] to establish their sensitivity to heati ng. Subjects will be removed from the hot 
bath immediately if either core temperature reac hes 39.5°C or the subjects experience any symptoms 
of heat -related illness. All symptoms subside upon lowering core temperature. Ice packs will be on 
hand if rapid cooling is necessary. Heart rate will also be continuously monitored and recorded 
throughout  heating. If HR increases >60 beats/min above resting or increases >20 beats/min with a 5 -

detrimental effects on a developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. Thus, subjects who are pregnant or trying to conceive will be 
excluded from the study.  Additionally, repetitive use of hot baths has been reported to lower sperm 
counts and sperm motility in some males; however, the decreased sperm counts are reversed within a 
few months after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_626393]. The probability  of the adverse reactions discussed 
above is low, and the severity  is low. 
Core temperature pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].  Core temperature is measured by [CONTACT_626425][INVESTIGATOR_4382], about the size of a multi -
vitamin, which  is designed and approved for human use  and is accurate to 0.1ºC. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_626394]’s intestinal tract. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_626395], is disposable, and every 
subject receives a new pi[INVESTIGATOR_626396]. The risks include mechanical injury to the mucus 
membranes if adequate care is not used. There is a small risk of electrical shock if there is a current 
leak. Risks of the temperature pi[INVESTIGATOR_294357]. 
Volunteers with history of obstructive diseases of the gastrointestinal tract including diverticulosis, 
diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer  disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or 
previous GI surgery should not use a telemetric pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. The probability  of the adverse reactions discussed 
above is low, and the severity  is moderate.  
Rectal thermistors.  The use of rectal thermistors to measure core temperature carries minimal risk. 
The primary risk is damage to the lining of the rectum; however, this risk is very slight as we use a 
flexible thermistor that is designed for this purpose. Subjects with  recent rectal, anal, vaginal or prostate 
surgery  should not use a rectal thermistor . In addition, subject s who have a personal history of heart 
disease  should not use a rectal thermistor , as the use of a rectal thermometer can cause a vagal 
reaction, increasing  the potential for arrhythmias and fainting. There is also the risk of infection, either 
by [CONTACT_626426] a poorly cleaned thermistor. Each subject 
receives a sterilized thermistor which is labeled with their subject number. T hermistor s are cleaned by 
[CONTACT_423] s and disinfected by [CONTACT_626427] . The risk of infection is similar to that of 
having a bowel movement and is considered minimal. There is also the risk of embarrassment. This 
approach is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_470451], and the investigative team is professional in regard to 
their treatment of the subjects. The probability  of the adverse reactions discussed above is low, and 
the severity  is low. 
Digital aural and oral thermometers.  There are no risks associated with the use of digital aural and 
oral thermometers.  
Cardiac output. There are no risks associated with breathing acetylene or helium, particularly in such 
low concentrations.  
Blood sampling.  There is the possibility of bruising, bleeding or infection at the site of venous access. 
In regard to  probability of harm, in a published study with 4,050 subjects who had venipuncture 
performed, 12% experienced minor bruising. Serious complications were observed in less than 3% of 
patients, syncope only occurring in less than 1% of patients15. On each pre-, interim -, and post -
intervention testing timepoint, we will take an intravenous sample using sterile venipuncture and 
withdrawal 40ml of blood  immediately following the [ADDRESS_834737] donated blood in the 8 
weeks prior to experiment enrollment. Add itionally, subjects will be asked not to donate blood or 
participate in other studies in which blood is drawn for 8 weeks following the experiments. This 
requirement is consistent with Association of American Blood Banks standards for blood donation. If th e

from mild discomfort. Pressure will be applied to the site after removal of the needle to assure that any 
bleeding cease s quickly. A band -aid and/or small gauze pressure wrappi[INVESTIGATOR_626397]’s arm to keep the site protected. The risk of infection at the site is low. The subject will be 
instructed on how to keep the site clean during the days following the study.  The probability  of the 
adverse reactions discussed above is low, and the severity  is low. 
Subject Rights and Withd rawal. Taking part in this research is a voluntary decision made by [CONTACT_626428].  The subjects can stop at any time and their decision whether or not to participate will 
not affect their relationship with the University of Oregon.  By [CONTACT_626429], subjects do not 
waive any liability rights for personal injury. The investigators may stop a subject from taking part in this 
study at any time if it is in their best interest, if the subjects do not follow the study rules  (e.g., 
compliance of less than 70% for heat or exercise sessions, or failure to follow study guidelines des pi[INVESTIGATOR_626398]) , or if the study is stopped. For example, if the investigators determine the study is 
overly stressful for the subject (as indicated by [CONTACT_626430]/or blood pressure) they may stop the subject from participating in the study. Or , if subjects express 
pain or discomfort beyond what is normally expected, the investigators will stop the subject from 
participating in the study.    
Emergency Procedures.  In the unlikely event of a medical emergency, we w ill follow the “Guidance for 
Human Physiology Investigators on Emergency and Non -Emergency Procedures for Human Subject 
Research,” approved previously by [CONTACT_1201]. In addition, we would provide responding emergency 
healthcare providers  with the MEDICAL HISTORY FORM provided by [CONTACT_423] . 
As this human subject research meets the definition of Clinical Trial , we have attached our DATA AND 
SAFETY MONITORING PLAN .  
Protocol 2:  
MRI Scan.  Given  the physics of MRI, there are three potential pathways for risk associated with MRI 
scanning: heating, sound, and the static field itself. The static magnetic field of the scanner presents the 
most significant risk if ferromagnetic objects are brought into the room. There is a risk these objects 
may be strongly attracted to the MRI machine. They may also lead to heating a nd burns. This can 
occur if the participant or LCNI equipment are not positioned properly inside the scanner by [CONTACT_626431] . To minimize this risk, LCNI ‐trained staff will conduct a thorough screening for any 
potential problems (research staff usually do this once before they arrive and LCNI does it again right 
before the scanning session), to make sure we have accounted for all MRI ‐related concerns. 
Participants who do not pass screening are not run. LCNI has a very conservative approach to 
screening, whereby [CONTACT_626432] t he scan. Participants are very carefully positioned in the magnet with 
special insulating pads to ensure no conductive loops are present. The MRI scanner makes loud 
thumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], pounding and whining sounds during scans, which reaches levels that could cause h earing 
damage. Thus, every person in the magnet room during scanning must wear hearing protection 
(earplugs and/or special headphones). Some people become anxious and/or tired and/or 
claustrophobic from lying in the MRI machine. LCNI offers ‘practice’ sess ions in a mock scanner (a 
duplicate environment without the strong magnetic field) before the session to everyone and encourage 
their use, especially in people who do not know whether they are claustrophobic or not. The mock 
scanner looks and sounds just like the real scanner. This practice environment allows LCNI staff and/or 
investigators to pre -test and prepare patients for the real environment and to provide demonstration of 
details about the procedure. All participants are told that they may ask to stop the practice or real MRI 
scans at any time. They are given an emergency squeeze ball during the real MRI and instructed in its 
use. They may squeeze this ball at any time to stop the scan and be removed f rom the sc anner. 
Although there are no known risks to having an MRI during pregnancy, it is a time when the heart and 
Research Summary #05042018.006   Approved by [CONTACT_1744]: 3.15.[ADDRESS_834739] nature of the study procedures and given ample time to ask 
questions of study staff and investigators. Participants will be carefully screened and are acclimated to 
MRI scan procedures through a thorough screening and information process before the scan. 
Participants will be allowed to take breaks as needed and it will be made clear to all participants, both 
during the informed consent process that they are free to di scontinue their participation at any time 
without penalty. Any participant who experiences significant discomfort during assessment will be able 
to terminate the procedure immediately.  The probability  of the adverse reactions discussed above is 
low, and th e severity  is low. 
 
H. Potential Benefits of the Research  
The potential benefit s of the  study in terms of knowledge to be gained outweigh  the risks of the study.  
Protocol 1:  
Hypertensi ves are at an elevated cardiovascular risk. The outcomes of this project may greatly benefit 
the general population in terms of the information that may be gleaned from this project. It is possible 
the outcomes of this research may impact the future clinical treatment of patients at elevated 
cardiovascular risk. Thus, the potential benefits of the study greatly outweigh the risks subjects may 
experience  in Protocol 1 .  
Protocol 2:  
Heat therapy may be used to  target elevated systolic blood pressure and Stage -[ADDRESS_834740] pathology i n mid -life adults. Collectively,  these studies will examine relationships 
between SBP, large  artery stiffness  (outcome measures in Protocol 1) , and tests of cognitive  
function/brain health  (additional outcome measures from Protocol 2)  with heat therapy.  Thus, the 
potential benefits of the study greatly outweigh the risks subjects may experience in Protocol 2.  
 
I. Investigator Qualifications, Roles, and Training

regulation, and human adaptations to environmental extremes for the last [ADDRESS_834741]. Halliwill has extensive experience with exercise physiology, vascular regulation, and has been 
conducting human studies using many of the proposed methods for 25 years.

trained in many of the research techniques. She will also assist as needed with the heat therapy or 
exercise sessions.  
Alison Burggren, Ph.D., a Research Associate in the Robert and Beverly Lewis Center for 
Neuroimaging (LCNI) at the University of Oregon, will serve as a Coinvestigator of the proposed study. 
[CONTACT_626434] is an expert in fMRI imaging, and Alzheimer’s relate d dementias with [ADDRESS_834743]. Burggren will 
oversee all of the proposed cognitive tests and MRI measurements in th e administrative supplement, 
and will oversee the ana lyses of scans, including individual analytical methods for each imaging 
modality detailed in the proposal.

PROTECTING NURSING HOME RESIDENTS FROM INFECTIONS AND READMISSIONS 
Data Collection 
The goal of Project PROTECT is to evaluate whether a decolonization strategy can 
better protect residents from multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) and their 
associated infections and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250125]. To understand the impact of decolonization, we will assess several 
outcomes: 
Primary Outcome 
•Transfers due to infection (% of discharges to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250126])
Secondary Outcome 
•All cause admissions (% of discharges to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])
Other outcomes of interest include MDRO prevalence (MRSA, VRE, ESBL, CRE), 
antibiotic usage, and emergence of resistance (strain collection). Project  PROTECT 
coordinators will work  closely with the on-site study  champi[INVESTIGATOR_250127].  Additionally,  data will be obtained  from state and 
national  datasets. 
[ADDRESS_303985] is being conducted by [CONTACT_250147], and Harbor -UCLA.  
 
From this training you will learn:  
Why Project PROTECT is important  
Which group your nursing home belongs to  
The importance of routine care  
How to contact [CONTACT_250148]  
 
This training module will take approximately 10 minutes to complete

This trial is evaluating whether bathing with special antiseptic soap plus 
using nasal products to remove nose bacteria (universal decolonization)  
is better than routine bathing in nursing homes in reducing infection 
and antibiotic -resistant bacteria  
The goal is to:  
Reduce transfers to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250128]  
Reduce antibiotic use  
Reduce multi -drug resistant organisms ( MDROs)  
The 28 Southern [LOCATION_004] nursing homes participating in this trial will 
be randomized to one of the following groups:  
Group 1 : Routine Care  
Group 2 : Universal Decolonization  
Intervention begins April [ADDRESS_303986]?  
3 16
Your nursing home has been randomized to Group 1: Routine Care  
This means you will continue routine bathing and showering of all 
residents with your usual products  as you are already doing  
 Group 1: Routine Care  
Maintain Current Bathing/Showering

Every new strategy needs to be compared to an existing strategy to 
know if it is better or not  
Strategies that are not better than current care, should not be adopted  
Nursing homes in the routine care group serve as the current gold 
standard to assess whether decolonization is helpful or not  
Remember , decolonization is labor -intensive and incurs cost, so we only 
want to implement if we are absolutely certain it is effective  
Critical to maintain current practices

Here is a scenario on the importance of maintaining current practices:  
Let’s assume decolonization has a real effect. Group 1 (Routine Care) 
nursing homes add in some additional interventions that improve 
infection rates while Group [ADDRESS_303987] of the decolonization strategy  It is Critical  to M aintain Current 
Practices

Competing Interventions  
7 IMPORTANT  
Participation in the routine care group includes an agreement to NOT 
implement new quality improvement initiatives that involve CHG or 
iodophor  
 
Your key role is to maintain current processes for bathing and 
showering. Do not change current basic  practices.

Special Circumstances  
8 If a physician places an order to decolonize a resident with iod ophor, 
chlorhexidine, or both, you should do the following:  
 
1. Follow the physician orders  
AND 
2. Remind the physician that this nursing home is part of Project 
PROTECT. This nursing home has been randomized to the routine car e 
arm which does not involve routine decolonization of residents.  
 
 
21
 No. The IRB has granted a waiver of consent.  
 
 This protocol has approved by [CONTACT_250149] (45 CFR part 46), to be 
implemented as a minimal risk project. Specifically, this project c ompares 
two Quality Improvement strategies . This improvement strategy has met 
all criteria for waiver of consent. A handout will be provided for all 
residents upon admission to the nursing home.  
  
Is Resident Consent Required?  
[ADDRESS_303988] strategies for 
reducing infection, antibiotic use, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and multi -
drug resistant organisms (MDROs) in nursing homes.  
 
Your role in the Routine Care group of this trial is critical to 
understand whether decolonization is or is not beneficial 
over current best practice.

 Prevent infections during nursing home stay  
HOW TO APPLY  Nasal 10% Povidone -Iodine (Iodophor)  
Instructions  
 Apply iodophor swabs twice daily  for 5 days every 
other week  
 Clears bacteria that live in the nose that can cause infection, like S. aureus (including MRSA)  
 80% of S. aureus infections are caused by [CONTACT_250150]’s own nose  
 
Povidone -Iodine use in specific circumstances  
 If nasal device in place (NG tube), swab around  
tubing if possible  
 If nasal packing in place, do not apply to that nostril  
 STAFF  
Do NOT blow nose if solution drips.  
Gently wipe with a tissue.  
Clean nostrils (including tip) with tissues prior to  application Repeat with 2nd swab in other nostril Apply nasal povidone -iodine antiseptic swabs to all  
residents twice daily for 5 days every other week 
to help remove germs and prevent infection  
 How to Use:  
Insert swab into one nostril and rotate for [ADDRESS_303990] residents from multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) and their 
associated infections and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250125]. To understand the impact of decolonization, we will assess several 
outcomes: 
Primary Outcome 
•Transfers due to infection (% of discharges to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250126])
Secondary Outcome 
•All cause admissions (% of discharges to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])
Other outcomes of interest include MDRO prevalence (MRSA, VRE, ESBL, CRE), 
antibiotic usage, and emergence of resistance (strain collection). Project 
PROTECT  coordinators will work  closely with the on-site study  champi[INVESTIGATOR_250129].  Additionally,  data will be obtained  from

Randomization 
The unit of randomization will be the nursing home, with all residents within a 
nursing home assigned to the same arm. Cluster randomization is the only feasible 
randomization method when an intervention must be applied (or is typi[INVESTIGATOR_79813] ) to an 
entire group, such as a quality improvement initiative. It is  also the only method for 
evaluating interventions for which individuals are linked, e.g., by [CONTACT_250151], as occurs in nursing home s. Cluster randomization also has the 
advantage of studying interventions under conditions of actual use, of minimizing 
disruption to normal practice, and of allowing the use of healt h system resources for 
ensuring compliance with the intended treatment.  
In cluster -randomized trials, the relatively smaller number of randomized units 
means that simple randomization may not ensure balance of key variables by [CONTACT_29745]. 
The existence o f a priori  data allows us to improve balance through stratification. One way 
is to establish pairs with similar covariate profiles in which one member per pair is 
assigned to each arm. There is no “best” method of making pairs. One approach we used in 
[ADDRESS_303993] good median balance on both 
characteristics, but a long tail implying a few bad -luck assignments with poor balance.  
We aim to balance facility case mix based upon population age, wounds, 
comorbi dities, and functional status scores, as well as infection prevention activities 
assessed by [CONTACT_154700] . To assess balance, we will use a parallel coordinates plot, a 
multivariate plot method. A simulation  (Figure)  shows a potential result of a single pair 
construction method using baseline values of volume, outcome, device  
use, and bathing frequency. Each blue, red, green, or black line  
shows the mean difference between arms for all four variables 
for one realized randomization under the scheme. The results 
show that a few randomizations, in blue, are relatively 
imbalanced on volume and outcome but are balanced on device 
use and bathing, while a few others, in black, have the reverse 
pattern. The green and red realizations are approximately 
equally balanced across these variables. If we considered it 
more important to balance on volume and outcome, this would 
not be an ideal scheme, as medium or poor balance is common.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
All outcomes will be assessed similarly. Here, we use the example of  the primary 
outcome: the probability a transfer to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250133] . Mai n trial 
results will be based on as -randomized, unadjusted analyses using logistics regression 
models. Clustering within nursing home will be accounted for using random effects, which 
are added model terms that allow unique baseline rates  for each nursing home , and are 
necessary to account for clustered randomization. Model terms will include individual -level 
data on arm, nursing home, outcome events, trial period (baseline vs. intervention) and an 
interaction term between trial period and arm. T rial succes s will be determined by [CONTACT_250152], which assesses whether the difference in log odds 
between the baseline and intervention period differs significantly between the two arms.

the risk of infectious transfer.  
 Subsequent analyses will include as -treated and covariate -adjusted models. 
Adjusted models will account for individual age, gender, comorbidities (by [CONTACT_250153]), and fun ctional status scores. All analyses will use current versions of SAS (9.4),

Power  
We assessed p ower via resampling methods. We used preliminary data  on outcomes  
adjusted to an [ADDRESS_303995], each nursing home  was 
randomly assigned to a study arm. Then, individuals were sampled with replacement from 
within each nursing home  to simulate  “baseline” period data. Individuals were sampled 
again to simulate the “follow -up” period data.  For nursing homes  assigned to  intervention 
arm, observed readmissions among the sampled follow -up individuals were removed at a 
given probability  to reflect the effect of the intervention.  Finally, the analysis planned for 
the trial was conducted  on the resampled “baseline” and “follow -up” data. In this case, the 
planned analysis is a generalized linear mixed model logistic regression with main effects 
for period and arm, with the study effect assessed via their interaction, as described abov e. 
To es timate power, we repeated this process [ADDRESS_303996] was rejected, with alpha = .05, provided  the 
estimated  power.  In contrast to analytic approaches to power, we also needed to  find 
confidence limits on the estimate, which we did using exact methods.  For cluster -
randomized trials, this approach has the advantage that it does not require guessing t he 
value of the intra -class correlation coefficient, or , importantly, its variability.  In addition, 
this approach  does not require a n assumption of constant cluster size.   
For our primary outcome, p reliminary data showed that 21.3 % of  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250134]. For the probability of transfer due to infection, 
we assessed the pow er for a relative reduction of 15 %, from 21.3% to 18.1 %. Power  was 
estimated at 89% (95% CI [83%, 93%]). For  our key secondary outcome of the probability 
of transfer to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250135], our preliminary data sh owed  that 37.8 % of  
discharges were associated with admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250136]. For this 
outcome, w e estimated  the power for a relative reduction of 8%, from 37.8 % to 34.8%, to 
be 99.5 % (95% CI [97%, 99.9%]). Even at  a relative reductio n of 5%, we have 74% power 
(95% CI [67%, 80 %]). These effect sizes are meaningful  because there is tremendous 
[ADDRESS_303997] in reducing preventable readmissions, of which infections are a major 
cause. Reductions in overall readmissions of 1-3% are lauded as sizeable in the CMS 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250137] 2,[ADDRESS_303998] revenue. The second year of this program 
saw a reduction of 0.6% in all  cause readmissions.  In summary, our  power assessment 
demonstrates adequate power to detect plausible and meaningful  effects of the proposed 
trial.

Participating nursing homes (28) we re randomized to  
• Arm 1 – Routine Care  
Nursing homes in this group arm did not change their bathing materials, timing, 
schedule, or other aspects of bathing regimen.  
• Arm 2 – Universal Decolonization  
Nursing homes in this group  used chlorhexidine  soap or wipes  for admission 
bathing and then for  all resident bathing.  They did not otherwise change their 
bathing materials, timing, schedule, or other aspects of bathing regimen.  In 
addition, nasal iodophor was  administered  twice daily Monday through Friday, 
every other week.

Main trial results will be based on as -randomized, unadjusted analyses using 
generalized linear mixed models  logistic regression . All outcomes will be assessed 
similarly. Here, we use the example of the primary outcome: transfer to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250143] . Clustering within nursing home will be accounted for using random 
effects, which are added model terms that allow unique baseline rates  for each nursing 
home , and are used  to account for clustered randomization.207 -208 Model terms will include  
individual -level data on arm, nursing home, outcome events, trial period (baseline vs. 
intervention) and an interaction term between trial period and arm. Trial results  will be 
assessed through the interaction term, which measures  the difference in log od ds between 
the baseline and intervention period between the two arms. We can write a simple version 
of the model symbolically as:

Statistical Plan Amendments  
 
Date  Statistical Plan Amendments  
2/4/2015  Original  
8/20/2018  • Defined ‘other’ outcomes for secondary publications . Previously, clinicaltrials.gov 
listed both secondary outcomes for the primary manuscript and outcomes for 
secondary manuscripts under the same heading. After the ability to separate th e two 
under “other outcomes,” we clarified additional outcomes that were not  trial 
outcomes.  
o Multidrug -resistant organism (MDRO) colonization  (separate aim from the 
trial in original grant; distinct design, methods, collection, analysis ) 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250141], in Long Stay and Short Sta y Subsets  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250144] , in Long Stay and Short Stay Subsets  
o Emergency Departme nt visits d ue to Infection; overall and in Long Stay and 
Short Stay Subsets  
6/19/2019  • Remov ed secondary outcome ( antibiotic usage ) 
o We had proposed to use the CMS Minimum Data Set (MDS) to assess this  and 
other trial  outcome s. At the time of the grant proposal, antibiotic usage was a 
newly -added variable. We assumed that this variable would increase in usage 
and accuracy with time. However, even five years after the variable was 
added, expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_250145], was that 
antibi otic data capture in MDS was poor and insufficient  for analysis . Thus, 
the steering committee removed this as an outcome and filed a change with 
clinicaltrials.gov at that time. We note that MDS data is released 18 months 
following completion of a calendar  year. This decision was made prior to 
receipt of any intervention data ( 2017 -2018 MDS data ) for the trial  and prior 
to any data cleaning or  analysis.  
8/10/2019  • Updated layout, no change in content or meaning  
• Removed randomization details from statistical  plan

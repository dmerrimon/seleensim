evaluate the immunogenicity , reactogenicity  and safet y of 
three doses of Pediarix®, Hiberix® and Prevenar 13® when 
co-administered with two doses of the PCV -free liquid

Rationale for the 
study and study 
designRationale for the stud y
Using advanced technology  in 2010, researchers from the 
University  of [LOCATION_004], San Francisco identified 
Deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments of Porcine circovirus 
type 1 (PCV- 1) in Rotarix . Further investigations conducted 
by [CONTACT_599668] (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) confirmed the presence of PCV -1 DNA 
fragments in Rotarix and its starting materials . Low levels of 
PCV -1 viral particles were also detected during theproduction 
process and in the fina l container. Retrospective laboratory  
investigations conducted by  [CONTACT_599669] 40 human rotavirus 
(HRV) vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_662219] -1, howe ver, PCV- 1 from the vaccine was identified in 
the stool samples of 4 infants from the HRV group (at Day  [ADDRESS_893471] Dose 1). The detection of PCV- [ADDRESS_893472] -vaccination was consistent with 
transient passage of DNA thro ugh the infants’ digestive tracts 
without replication. Lack of PCV -1 infection is further 
supported by  [CONTACT_662239] -PCV -1 antibody  in the HRV 
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], including the infants who had PCV- 1 DNA 
detected in their stool samples [Dubin, 2013]. In a follow -up 
retrospective laboratory  analy sis of samples of [ADDRESS_893473]-vaccination anti -PCV -1 antibody  seropositivity  rate of 
1% [90% Confidence Interval ( CI): 0.3-2.6] in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_662220] (3/299 samples) and 0.3% 
[90% CI : 0.0-1.6] in the placebo group (1/296 samples) was 
observed. The difference in the post -vaccination seropositivity  
and the seroconversion rates between the two study  groups 
were -0.66 [90% CI : -2.16-0.60] and -0.33 
[90% CI : -1.70–0.89], respectively . The 90 % CI for both 
group differences included 0, indicating that there was no 
statistically  significant increase as compared to the placebo

CONFIDENTIA L
201663 (ROTA -090)
Protocol Final Version [ADDRESS_893475] -2016 8[Han, 2016] . Therefore, currentl y available data do esnot 
suggest occurrence of PCV- 1 infection in infants who 
received R otarix in clinical trials. These results are consistent 
with published literature which indicates that PCV- 1 is not 
capable of causing infection in humans [ Hattermann, 2004a; 
Hattermann, 2004b].
[COMPANY_004] hasreplac edthe cell bank and virus seeds used as base 
production material for its HRV vaccine . In accordance with 
the regulators, the company  continues to manufacture Rotarix
to the existing standards of approved production and quality ,
to meet public health needs worldwide.
This study  will assess if there is an y immune interference 
between the PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine and routine infant 
vaccinations currentl y in use in the US, namely Pediarix , 
Hiberix andPrevenar 13 as compared to the currently  
licensed lyophil ized formulation of the HRV vaccine when 
co-administered with the same routine vaccinations.
Rationale for the stud y design
The study  is designed as a randomized, controlled, 
single -blind study  with two parallel groups. This study will 
evaluate the i mmuno genicity , reactogenicity and safet yof the 
vaccines Pediarix , Hiberix and Prevenar [ADDRESS_893476] y ear of 
life, when co -administered with the PCV -free liquid HRV 
vaccine as compared to the licensed l yophiliz ed vaccine.
The currently  licensed l yophilized Rotarix vaccine 
co-administered with routine infant vaccines in the US has 
been shown not to impair the immune response to any  of the 
co-administered antigens [Dennehy  2008]. Therefore, t he use 
of the currently  licensed ly ophilized vaccine as the control is 
considered appropriate . Furthermore, this study  design will 
avoid logistical constraints related to the inclusion of 
co-administration and separate administration of US routine 
infant vaccines in the same study .
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), 
consisting of clinical experts and a biostatistician will review 
the safet y data periodically to monitor the safet y aspects of the 
PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine.
This study  will have a single -blind design to ensure that the 
subject’s parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) 
(LARs )are not influenced by  [CONTACT_662240] y events and when

Objectives Co-Primary
To demonstrate the non -inferiorit y of the immune 
responses to three doses of Pediarix, Hiberix and 
Prevenar 13 when co -administered with two doses of the 
PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine, as compared to when co -
administered with the currently  license d lyophilized HRV 
vaccine, 1 month after Dose 3 of routine infant vaccines.
Criteria for non -inferiority : 
Lower limits of the two-sided standardized 
asymptotic 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the 
differences between groups ( HRV Liq group minus 
HRV Lyo group) in the percentages of subjects with 
seroprotective concentrations ( 0.1 IU/mL) for each 
of anti -diphtheria (anti -D) and anti -tetanus (anti- T) 
antibodies are -10% (clinical limit for non-
inferiority),
The lower limit of the two-sided standardized 
asymptotic 95% CI on the difference between groups 
(HRV Liq group minus HRV Lyo group) in the 
percentages of subjects with seroprotective 
concentration ( 10 mIU/mL) for antibodies against 
hepatitis B surface antigen (anti- HBs) is -10% 
(clinical limit for non-inferiority),
Lower limits of the two-sided standardized 
asymptotic 95% CIs on the differences between 
groups (HRV Liq group minus HRV Lyo group) in 
the percentages of subjects with seroprotective titers 
(8 ED 50) for each of 
anti-poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3 antibodies are
-5% (clinical limit for non -inferiority),
Lower limits of the two-sided 95% CIs on the 
geometric mean antibody concentrations (GMC) 
ratios ( HRV Liq group over HRV Lyo group) for 
antibodies against each of the pertussis toxoid ( PT), 
filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin 
(PRN) antigens [anti -PT, anti- FHA and anti -PRN]  
are 0.67 (clinical limit for non -inferiority),
Lower limits of the two-sided 95% CIs on the GMC 
ratios ( HRV Liq group over HRV Lyo group) for 
each of the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. 
pneumoniae) serotypes are 0.5 (clinical limit for

The lower limit of the two -sided standardized 
asymptotic 95% CI on the difference between groups 
(HRV Liq group minus HRV Lyo group) in the 
percentages of su bjects with concentration of 
antibodies against polyribosyl -ribitol -phosphate

(HRV Liq group minus HRV Lyo group) in the 
percentages of subjects with concentration of 
antibodies against anti -PRP 1.0 g/mL is -10% 
(clinical limit for non- inferiority).
To rule out a 10% decrease in seroresponse to PT, FHA 
and PRN antigen when Pediarix is co- administered with 
PCV-free-liquid HRV vaccine compared to when 
Pediarix is co- administered with the currently  licensed 
lyophilized HRV vaccine.
seroresponse is defined as the percentage of subjects 
showing an antibody  concentration above a threshold 
that leads to 95% serore sponse in the control group 
(lyophilized HRV vaccine) ,
p-value on the difference in seroresponse between 
groups is < 2.5% for each PT, FHA and PRN antigen 
(p-value is computed b y integrating on the p -value 
for the null hy pothesis that the seroresponse rate in 
the liquid group is < 85% and the a -posteriori 
probability  of the threshold in the ly ophilized group) .

1.1. Background
Rotavirus ( RV) infection is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis ( GE) and severe
diarrh eain infants and young children <5 years of age [ Atherl y,2009]. It has been 
estimated that in 2013, approximately  215,000 deaths were caused due to RV. India, 
Nigeria, Pakistan, a nd Democratic Republic of Congo, accounted for approximately  half 
(49%) of all the es timated RV deaths in 2013 [Tate, 2016].
Although RV infection rarel y causes death in Europe, North Americ a and Australia, it 
remains the most common cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662223]
[Desselberger , 2012]. In developed countries, RV infection remains the most common 
cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662224] m edical and societal costs . 
Over the last man y years, the development of vaccines has been beneficial in the 
prevention of considerable morbidity  and mortality due to RV. Two live or al HRV
vaccines have been licensed in many  countries; one is derived from an attenuated human 
strain of RV and the other combines fi vebovine -human reassortant strains [Glass , 2006]. 
Each of these vaccine shave been proven highl y effective in preventing severe RV
diarrh ea by  [CONTACT_662242][INVESTIGATOR_662225]. Moreover, these 
vaccines could reduce deaths from diarrh ea and improve child survival through programs
such as childhood immuni zations and diarrh eal disease control in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696]. 
The World He alth Organi sation (WHO) recognis es HRV vaccination as an effective 
measure to prevent RV infection and to reduce disease burden, and recommends its 
inclusion into all national infant immuniz ation programs, particularly  in countries where 
RV GE associated fatality rates are high among children aged <5 years (e.g., south and 
south- eastern Asia and sub- Saharan Africa) [WHO position paper , 2013].
GlaxoSmithKl ine ([COMPANY_004]) Biologicals’ H RVvaccine (Rotarix™) is a vaccine for oral use, 
containing the live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) RIX4414 strain. It has previousl y 
been observed tha t infants aged younger than three months who received the vaccine did 
not develop diarrh ea, vomiting or fever during the trial [Vesikari , 2004(a) ]. The initial 
trials that [COMPANY_004] conducted in Finland showed safety , immunogenicity  and efficacy  of the 
Rotarix vaccine [ Vesikari ,2004(b)]. InLatin America n and European studies, vaccine 
efficacy  of oral live attenuated HRV vaccine Rotarix was high, ranging from 80.5% to 
90.4% against severe RVGE, and 83.0% to 96.0% against hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662226] y ears of life.[ Vesikari , 2007; Linhares , 2008]. Furthermore , resul ts 
from a phase III clinical study  undertaken in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan showed 
that during the first two years of life, two doses of Rotarix vaccine provided a high level 
of protection against severe RV GE (vaccine efficacy : 96.1%), and had a saf ety profile 
similar to the placebo [Phua , 2012]. Such safet y and efficacy studies in Europe, Latin 
America and Asia have confirmed that the vaccine is safe, well -tolerated and efficacious 
(range: 80- 96%) in preventing severe RVGEin the first two y ears of life 
[Cunliffe , 2014].

1.2. Rationale for the study  and study  design
1.2.1. Rational e for the study
Using advanced technology in 2010, researchers from the University  of [LOCATION_004], San 
Francisco identified Deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments of Porcine circovirus t ype 1 
(PCV -1) in Rotarix . Further investigation s conducted by  [CONTACT_599668] (US) 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed the presence of PCV -[ADDRESS_893533] es of 4 infants 
from the HRV group (at Day  [ADDRESS_893534] Dose 1). The detection of PCV -[ADDRESS_893535] -vaccination was consistent with transient passage of 
DNA through the infants’ digestive tracts without replication. Lack o f PCV -1 infection is 
further supported b y the absence of anti -PCV -1 antibody  in the HRV vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 
including the infants who had PCV- 1 DNA detected in their stool samples [ Dubin, 2013]. 
In a follow -up retrospective laboratory  anal ysis of samples of [ADDRESS_893536]-vaccination anti -PCV -1 antibody  seropositivity  rate of 1% [90% Confidence Interval 
(CI): 0.3-2.6] in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_662228] e (3/299 samples) and 0.3% 
[90% CI : 0.0-1.6] in the placebo group (1/296 samples) was observed. The difference in
the post -vaccination seropositivity  and the seroconversion rates between the two study  
groups were -0.66 [90% CI : -2.16- 0.60] and - 0.33 [90% CI: -1.70–0.89], respectively . 
The 90% CI for both group differences included 0, indicating that there was no 
statistically  significant increase as compared to the placebo [ Han, 2016]. Therefore, 
currentl y available data do esnot suggest occurrence of PCV- 1 infection in infants who 
received Rotarix in clinical trials .These results are consistent with published literature 
which indicates that PCV-1 is not capable of causing infection in humans [ Hattermann, 
2004a; Hattermann, 2004b].
[COMPANY_004] hasreplac edthe cell bank and virus seeds used as base production material for its 
HRV vaccine . In accordance with the regulators, the compan y continues to manufacture 
Rotarix to the existing standards of approved production and quality ,to meet public 
health needs worldwide.
This study  will assess if there is an y immune interference between the PCV -free liquid 
HRV vaccine and routine infant vaccinations currently  in use in the US, namely  Pediarix , 
Hiberix and Prevenar 13 as compared to the currently  licensed lyophilized formulation of 
the HRV vaccine when co -administered with the same routine vaccinations.

as compared to the licensed ly ophilized vaccine.
The currently  licensed l yophilized Rotarix vaccine co- administered with routine infant 
vaccines in the US has been shown not to impair the immune response to any  of the 
co-administered antigens [ Dennehy , 2008]. Therefore, t he use of the currently  licensed 
lyophilized vaccine as the control is considered appropriate . Furthermore, this study  
design will avoid logistical constraints related to the inclusion of co -administration and 
separate administration of US routine infant v accines in the same study .
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), consisting of clinical experts and a 
biostatistician will review the safet y data periodically to monitor the safety aspects of the 
PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine.
This study  will have a single -blind design to ensure that the s ubject’s parent(s)/Legall y 
Acceptable Representative(s) (LARs) are not influenced b y the knowledge of the Rotarix
formulation when reporting safet y events and when complying with the study procedure .

2. OBJECTIVES
2.1. Co-Primary  objective s
To demonstrate the non -inferiorit y of the immune responses to three doses of 
Pediarix , Hiberix and Prevenar 13 when co- administered with two doses of the
PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine, as compared to when co -administered with the 
currentl y licensed lyophilized HRV vaccine, 1 month after Dose 3 of routine infant 
vaccines .
Criteria for non -inferiority : 
Lower limits of the two-sided standardized asymptotic 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) on the differences between groups (HRV Liq group minus HRV Lyo group) 
in the percentages of subjects with seroprotective concentrations ( 0.1 IU/mL) 
for each of anti- diphtheria (anti -D) and anti -tetanus (anti- T) antibodies are
-10% (clinical limit for non -inferiority ),
The lower limit of the two -sided standardized asymptotic 95% CI on the 
difference between groups ( HRV Liq group minus HRV Lyo group) in the 
percentages of subjects with seroprotective concentration ( 10 mIU/mL) for 
antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen (anti- HBs) is -10% (clinical

Lower limits of the two-sided 95% CIs on the geometric mean antibody 
concentrations ( GMC) ratios ( HRV Liq group over HRV Lyo group) for 
antibodies against each of the pertussis toxoid (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin 
(FHA) and pertactin (PRN) antigens [anti- PT, anti -FHA and anti -PRN]  are 
0.67 (clinical limit for non -inferiority),
Lower lim its of the two -sided 95% CIs on the GMC ratios (HRV Liq group over 
HRV Lyo group) for each of the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.pneumoniae )
serotypes are 0.5 (clinical limit for non- inferiority) ,
The lower limit of the two -sided standardized asymptotic 95% CI on the 
difference between groups (HRV Liq group minus HRV Lyo group) in the 
percentages of subjects with concentration of antibodies against polyribosyl -
ribitol -phosphate antigen (anti -PRP) 0.15 g/mL is - 5%,

To rule out a 10% decrease in seroresponse to PT, FHA and PRN antigen when 
Pediarix is co- administered with PCV -free-liquid HRV vaccine compared to when 
Pediarixis co- administered with the currently  licensed ly ophilized HRV vaccine.
seroresponse is defined as the percentage of subjects showing an antibody  
concentration above a threshold that leads to 95% seroresponse in the control 
group (ly ophilized HRV vaccine) ,
p-value on the difference in seroresponse between groups is < 2.5% for eac h PT, 
FHA and PRN antigen (p -value is computed b y integrating on the p -value for 
the null hy pothesis that the seroresponse rate in the liquid group is <85% and the 
a-posteriori probability  of the threshold in the ly ophilized group) .

5.2.2. Randomization of treatment
[IP_ADDRESS]. Randomization of supplies
The numbering of HRV vaccine supplies will be performed at [COMPANY_004] Biologicals, using a 
block scheme randomiz ation in MATerial EXce llence (MATEX), a program developed 
for use in Statistical Analy sis Sy stem (SAS®) (Cary , NC, US ) by [CONTACT_43055] . Entire 
blocks will be shipped to the study  center s/warehouse(s).
To allow [COMPANY_004] Biologicals to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment than 
anticipated at individual centers in this multi -center study  and to thus reduce the overall 
study  recruitment period, an over -randomiz ation of supplies will be prepared. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment allocation to the subject
The treatment n umbers will be allocated by  [CONTACT_2715] .
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Study group and treatment number allocation
The target wi ll be to enrol 128 0 eligible subjects who w ill be randomly  assigned to two
study  groups in a (1: 1) ratio (approximately  640 subjects in each group).
Allocation of the subject to a study  group at the investigator site will be performed using 
SBIR. The randomiz ation algorithm will use a minimiz ation procedure accounting f orthe
centerand the study as minimization factors. Minimization factors will have equal weight 
in the minimization algorithm.
After obtaining the signed and dated ICF from the subject’s pare nt/LAR and having 
checked the eligibility  of the subject, the site staff in charge of the vaccine administration 
will access SBI R. Upon providing the subject ide ntification number, the randomiz ation 
system will determine the study  group and will provide the treatment number to be used 
for the first dose .
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.
When SBI R is not available , please refer to the SBIR user guide or the Study  Procedures 
Manual (SPM) for specific instructions.

administration will access SBI R, provide the subject identification number, and the 
system will provide a treatment number consistent with the allocated study group.
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.
5.3. Method of blinding 
This study  is single -blind where the investigator and/or his staff will be aware of the 
treatment assignment and the subject’s parents/LARs will not be aware of the treatment 
assignment .
The laboratory  in charge of the laboratory  testin g will be blinded to the treatment, and 
codes will be used to link the subject and stud y (without any link to the treatment 
attributed to the subject) to each sample.
5.4. General study  aspects
Supplementary  study  conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing SPM. The SPM provides the investigator and the site 
personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact the

Advisory  Committee on Immunization Practices (ACI P) recommends administering
monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Infants who 
did not recei ve a birth dose should receive three doses of a Hepatitis -B-containing 
vaccine on a schedule of 0, [ADDRESS_893574] dose (minimum interval of four
weeks), admi nister the third dose at least eight weeks after the second dose AND at least 
[ADDRESS_893575] dose. The final (third or fourth) dose in the Hepatitis Bvaccine 
series should be administered no earlier than age 24 weeks .
Whenever possible, the investigator should arrange study  visits within the interval 
described in Table 5.

and work reliably .
It is also possible that future findings may  make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this study  for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, 
all subjects in countries where this is allowed will be asked to give a specific consent
to allow [COMPANY_004] or a contracted partner to use the samples for future research. Future 
research will be subject to the laws and regulations in the US and will only  be 
performed once an IECor Review Board has approved this research.

perform an y other biological assay s except those described in the protocol or its 
amendment(s). 
If additional testing is performed, th e marker priority  ranking given in Section 5.7.4 may 
be changed.
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 y ears (counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study  visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require 
different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject 
consent. These extra requirements need to be communicated formall yto and discussed 
and agreed with [COMPANY_004] Biologicals.
5.7.1. Use of specified study materials
When materials are provided by  [CONTACT_43055], it is MANDATORY that all clinical 
samples (including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively  using those 
material s in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the 
exclu sion of the subject from the per -protocol analy sis (See Section 10.4 for the 
definition of cohorts to be anal yzed). The investigator must ensure that his/her personnel 
and the laboratory (ies) under his/her supervision comply  with this requirement. However, 
when [COMPANY_004] Biologicals does not provide material for collecting and storing clinical 
samples, appropriate materials from the investigator’s site must be used. Refer to the 
Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM.

5.7.5. Immunological correlates of protection
The following cut -offs are accepted as immunological cor relates of protection:
Specific antibodies against diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid will be measured b y 
Enzy me Linked Immunosorbent Assay  (ELISA ). The assay  cut-offs for anti -D and 
anti-T is currentl y set at 0.1 IU/mL  (ELISA), which provides a conserva tive estimate 
of the percentage of subjects deemed to be protected [ Camargo , 1984; Melville -
Smith , 1983] . 
Antibodies to the anti-HBs will be measured using CLIA . The cut -off of the test is 
set at 6.2 mIU/mL . An antibody  concentration 10mIU/mL defines seroprotection 
[CDC , 1991; WHO , 1988].
Antibodies against poliovirus ty pes 1, [ADDRESS_893592] adapted from the World Health Organiz ation Guidelines for 
WHO/EPI  [INVESTIGATOR_662230] [WHO , 1993]. The lowest dilution 
at which serum samples will be test ed is 1:8, from which a test will be considered 
positive. Titer s will be expressed in terms of the re ciprocal of the dilution resulting in 
50% inhibition. Antibody titers greater than or equal to this value are considered as 
protective.
Data from subjects given unconjugated Hib vaccine suggest that, in the absence of 
induction of immunological memory , a concentration of 0.15 g/mL  is indicative of 
short -term protection, with 1  g/mL considered indicative of long -term protection 
[Käyhty, 1983; Anderson , 1984].
No correlate of protection is defined for the immune response to pertussis antigens. 
Antibodies against the pertussis components PT, FHA and PRN will be measured b y 
ELISA technique. The current cut-offsfor all three pertussis antibodies arethe

2.693 IU/mL for PT, 2.046 IU/mL for FHA and 2.187 IU/mL for PRN . Subjects with 
antibody  concentration below this cut -off will be considered seronegative.
Pneumococcal serot ype specific total I gG antibodies (antibodies against 1, 3, 4, 5, 
6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19 A, 19F and 23F) will each be measured by [CONTACT_662248] (ECL) assay s. The LLOQ (in µg/mL) determined for 
each of these strains are shown in Table 7. No correlate of protection is defined for 
the immune response to pneumococcal antigens .
No immunological correlate of protection has been demonstrated so far for the 
antigen used as part of the HRV vaccine.
The investigator is encouraged to share the immunological assay  results for non-
responders with the study  subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s).
For the subjects identified as non- responders, it remains the responsibility  of the 
investiga tor in charge of the subject’s clinical management to determine the medical need 
for re -vaccination and to re -vaccinate the subjects as per local/regional practices.

6.2. Storage and handling of study  vaccine s
The study  vaccine s must be stored at the respective label storage temperature conditions 
in a safe and locked place. Access to the storage s pace should be limited to authorized 
study  personnel. The storage conditions will be assessed during pre- study  activities under 
the responsibility  of the sponsor study  contact. The storage temperature should be 
continuously  monitored with calibrated (if no t validated) temperature monitoring 
device(s) and recorded. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for 
more details on storage of the study  vaccine s.
Temperature excursions must be reported in degree Celsius.
Any temperature excursion ou tside the range of 0.0 to +8.0 C (for +2 to +8°C/+36 to 
+46°F label storage condition) impacting investigational medicinal products (I MPs) must 
be reported in the appropriate (electronic) temperature excursion decision form ([e]TDF). 
The impacted IMPs must not be used and must be stored in quarantine at label 
temperature conditions until usage approval has been obtained from the sponsor .
In case of temperature excursion below +2.0°C down to 0.0°C impacting IMP(s) there is 
no need to report in (e)TDF, but ad equate actions must be taken to restore the +2 to 
+8°C/+36 to +46°F label storage temperature conditions. The impacted I MP(s) may  still 
be administered, but the site should avoid re -occurrence of such temperature excursion.

6.3. Dosage and administration of stud y vaccines
Liquid formulation of HRV vaccine
The pre -filled oral applicator is shaken well before use. The vaccine (approximately  
1.5 mL ) should then be administered orally  as a single dose. 
Lyophilized formulation of HRV vaccine
To prepare [COMPANY_004] Biologicals' HRV ly ophilized vaccine for administration, the entire 
content of the supplied diluent (calcium carbonate buffer) should be transferred from the 
oral applicator into the vial of the ly ophilized product via the intermediate device. The 
vialshould be shaken well to resuspend the vaccine. The entire volume of the 
resuspended product (approximately  1 mL) should be withdrawn into the same oral 
applicator and the resuspended product should then be administer ed promptly  as a single 
oral dose.
Administration of the oral vaccines
In order to allow the swallowing of the entire volume of the single oral dose (of liquid or 
lyophilized formulation), the administration should occur in a quiet environment. The 
child s hould be seated in a reclining position. Administer orally  (i.e., into the child’s 
mouth towards the inner cheek) the entire content of oral applicator. Sufficient time 
should be allowed for the baby  [CONTACT_599682], to avoid regurgitation or 
vomiting. If regurgitation or vomiting occurs after vaccination, a single replacement dose 
may be given at the same vaccination visit . This information should be recorded in the 
eCRF. The subject may  continue to participate in the study . 
Administration of the intramuscular vaccines
In order to ensure proper IM injection of the co-administered vaccines, a needle of at 
least 1 inch (2.54 cm) length, 25 gauge will be used [ Diggle , 2006; Zuckerman , 2000].
The vaccinees will be observed closel y for at least 30 minutes, with appropriate medical 
treatment readily  available in case of a rare anaph ylactic reaction following the 
administrati on of vaccines.
The vaccination regimen is summarized in Table 10.

8.1. Safet y definitions
8.1.1. Definition of an adverse event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject , temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exa cerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. ,lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse. 
Examples of an AE include:
Significant or unexpected w orsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study .
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccines administration even 
though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
vaccine s or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an 
AE/SAE).
Signs, sy mptoms temporally  associated with study  vaccines administration.
Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. 
Pre-or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures 
(i.e.,invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 8.1.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs.

Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., endoscop y, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g., social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen .
Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the 
study  vaccination. These events will be recorded in the med ical history  section of the 
eCRF.
8.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event 
A SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that:
a.Results in death,
b.Is life -threatening,
Note: The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662231],
Note: I n general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662232]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complicati ons 
that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662233]. If a complica tion prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662234], the event will also be considered 
serious. When in d oubt as to whether ‘hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838]’ occurred or was necessary , the 
AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662235] a pre-existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated hea dache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrh ea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. ,sprained ankle) 
which may  interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.
Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medic al events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662236]

In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory  findings (e.g., clinical chemistry , 
hematology , urinaly sis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g., vital signs etc ) that are 
judged b y the investigator to be clinicall y significant will be recorded as AE or SAE if 
they meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to Section s8.1.1 and 8.1.2). Clinically  
significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at

The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded durin g the stud y. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.
The intensity  should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interferi ng with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which prevents normal, every day activities 
(In a young child, such an AE would, for example, preve nt 
attendance at a day-care center and would cause the 
parent(s)/LAR(s) to seek medical advice.)
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs an d SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.2.

Protocol Final Version [ADDRESS_893630] -2016 [IP_ADDRESS].2. Assessment of causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the rel ationship between study  vaccine sand the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. I n case of concomitant 
administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the investi gator should specify  
if the AE could be causally  related to a specific vaccine/product administered (i.e.,
investigational, control/placebo or co -administered vaccine). When causal relationship to 
a specific vaccine(s)/product(s) cannot be determined the i nvestigator should indicate the 
AE to be related to all products.
Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underl ying diseases, 
concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study  vaccines will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the 
IB and/or and/or SmPC and/or Prescribing Information for marketed products to 
determine his/her assessment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has m inimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. However, it is very  
important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to [COMPANY_004] Biological s. The 
investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up information and 
update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements.
Causality  of allAEs should be assessed b y the investigator using the following question:
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_106365] ?
YES :There is a reasonable possibility  that the study vaccine scontributed 
to the AE. 
NO :There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally  related to 
the administration of the study  vaccines. There are other, more 
likely  causes and administration of the study  vaccine sis not 
suspected to have contributed to the AE.
If an event m eets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 8.1.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigator in order to determine ALL 
possible contributing factors for each SAE.
Possible contributing factors include:
Medical history .
Other medication.
Protocol required procedure.
Other procedure not required by  [CONTACT_760].
Lack of efficacy  of the vaccine s, if applicable.

8.4.5. Regulatory  reporting requirements for serious adve rse events
The investigator will promptly  report all SAEs to [COMPANY_004] in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section 8.4.1. [COMPANY_004] Biologicals has a legal responsibility  to promptly  notify , 
as appropriate, both the local regulatory  authorit y and other regulatory  agencies about the 
safet y of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by  [CONTACT_43082] y Contact [CONTACT_159291] y of other subjects are met.
Investigator safety  reports are prepared according to the current [COMPANY_004] policy  and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator safet y report is prepared for a 
SAE(s) that is both attributable to the study vaccine s and unexpected. The purpose of the 
report is to fulfil specific regulatory  and GCP requirements, regarding the product under 
investigation.
8.5. Follow -up of adverse events and serious adverse events
8.5.1. Follow -up during the study
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject’s condition to [COMPANY_004]
Biologicals (within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to Table 15).
All SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_159292]/not

The investigator will follow subjects:
with SAEs, or subjects withdrawn from the stud y as a result of an AE, until the event 
has resolved, s ubsided, stabilised, disappeared, or until the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previousl y reported SAE, 
he/she will provide this information to [COMPANY_004] Biolog icals using a paper/ electronic 
Expedited Adverse Events Report and/or pregnancy  report as applicable.
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals may  request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of 
additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucida te as fully  as possible 
the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist. I f a 
subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognised follow -up period, 
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals will be provided with an y available post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology .
8.6. Treatment of adverse events
Treatment of an y AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current 
good medical practice . Any medication admi nistered for the treatment of a SAE should 
be rec orded in the subject’s eCRF (refer to Section 6.7).
8.7. Subject card
Study  subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) must be provided with the address and telephone 
number of the main contact [CONTACT_43089] .
The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a “subject card” to each subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s). In an emergency situation this card serves to inform the responsible 
attending phy sician that the subject is in a clinical study  and that relevant information 
may be obtained by  [CONTACT_21947].
Subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) must be instructed to keep subject cards in their possession at 
all times during the stud y duration.

Information relative to the withdrawa l will be documented in the eCRF . The investigator 
will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the study  was made b y 
the subject’s parent(s) /LAR(s ), or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following 
possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:
SAE
Unsolicited non- serious AE
Solicited AE
Protocol violation (specify )
Consent withdrawal, not du e to an AE*
Moved from the stud y area
Lost to follow -up
Other (specify )
*In case a subject is withdrawn from the study  because he/she/the subject’s 
parent(s) /LAR(s) has withdrawn consent, the investigator will document the reason for 
withdrawal of consent, if specified by  [CONTACT_423] /subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) , in the 
eCRF .
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study  because of SAEs/AEs must be clearl y 
distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will

10.3. Determination of sample size
The target sample size is 832 subjects evaluable for i mmunogenicit y analyses at Visit 4 
(416 subjects in each group). Assuming that approximately  35% of enrolled subjects 
might withdraw or not be evaluable for analy ses of immunogenicit y, the target sample 
size to be enrolled is 1280 subjects (640 subjects in each group).
The primary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate the immune response elicited to all 
antigens contained in each of the routine infant vaccines Pediarix , Hiberix and
Prevenar 13when co- administered with PCV -free l iquid HRV vaccine is non- inferior to

A 2.5% nominal type I error will be used for each co -primary  evaluation. To control the 
type I error below 2.5%, a hierarchica l procedure will be used for the multiple study  
objectives. That is, an objective will be reached if its associated criterion is met and the 
previous objectives were reached. The same order in which the study  objectives are listed 
in Section 2.1will be considered for h ypothesis testing.
The sample size has been estimated in order to obtain at least 90% power to demonstrate 
the co -primary  objectives. The power associated with the target sample size for the 
conclusion on each inferential objective of this study  is detailed in Section 10.3.3.

10.7.2. Betw een group assessment
For each treatment group, one month after Dose 3 of routine infant vaccines at Visit 4 
(Month 5) time -point :
Two-sided as ymptotic standardized 95% CIs for the difference in the percentage of 
subjects with titer/concentration above or equal to pre- specified clinical thresholds 
will be computed (HRV Liq group minus HRV Ly o group).
The two- sided 95% CIs for the group GMC /GMT ratio (HRV Liq group over HRV 
Lyo group) will be computed using an ANOVA model on the logarithm10 
transformation of the concentrations. The ANOVA model will include the vaccine 
group as fixed effects. In addition, for anti-HBs, the model will include the Hepatitis 
Bvaccination history  as co -variable .
For the group comparison in anti- PT, FHA, PRN seroresponse at one month post

10.9. Interpretation of analy ses
Except for anal yses addressing criteria specified in the co-primar y objective sreferred as 
confirmatory  anal yses, all the anal yses will be descriptive/ exploratory  in nature . The use 
of these descriptive/ exploratory  analy ses should be limited to support the confirmatory  
analyses or to generate hy pothesis .
10.9.1. Statistical methods
The exact 95% CIs for a proportion within a group will be based on the method by  
[CONTACT_94532] [ Clopper , 1934].
The standardized as ymptotic CI  for the group difference in proportion is the method 
6 described in the Newcombe paper [Newcombe , 1998]
The 95% CIs of the group GMC/GMT ratios w ill be computed using an ANOVA 
model on the logarithm10 transformation of the concentrations/titers. The ANOVA 
model will include the vaccine group as fixed effect s.In addition ,for anti-HBs, the 
model will include the Hepatitis B vaccination history  as co-variable .
The 95% CI for GMTs/GMCs will be obtained within each group separately . The 
95% CI  for the mean of log -transformed titer/concentration will be first obtained 
assuming that log -transformed values were normally  distributed with unknown 
variance. The 95% CI for the GMTs/GMCs will then be obtained b y exponential -
transformation of the 95% CI  for the mean of log- transformed titer/concentration.

Rotavirus Ab.IgA Determination
The anti -rotavirus antibody  concentrations are determined by  a validated anti -rotavirus 
IgA ELISA. Micro titerplates (96- well) are coated with an anti -rotavirus monoclonal 
antibody . The wells are washed and incubated with (positive wells) or without (negative 
wells) RV. Following incubation, the plates are washed and serum, standard and control 
dilutions are incu bated in both ty pes of wells (positive and negative). Bound 
anti-rotavirus IgA in the well are detected b y incubation with peroxidase conjugated 
anti-human IgA pol yclonal antibodies. Color development proportional to the quantity  of 
bound anti -rotavirus IgA occurs in t he presence of a chromogen, TetraMethy lBenzidine 
(TMB) , and measured spectrophotometrically. Specific optical densities are calculated for 
each sample/control/standard dilution by [CONTACT_662257], the use of negative wells allowing to assess non -specific IgA binding. The 
concentrations of the samples e xpressed in units per milliliter are calculated relative to 
the four -parameter logistic function generated from the standard curve.
Polio virus
Presen ce of antibodies against poliovirus ty pes 1, [ADDRESS_893685] adapted from the World Health Organization Guidelines for 
WHO/EPI  [INVESTIGATOR_662230] . The starting dilution at which serum 
samples will be tested is 1/8, from which a test wil l be considered positive. Titers will be 
expressed in terms of the reciprocal of the dilution resulting in 50% inhibition.
Streptococcus
Pneumococcal serot ype-specific immunoglobin G (IgG) antibodies (antibodies against 
seroty pes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) will be measured b y ECL
multiplex assay s. The antibody  concentration will be determined by  [CONTACT_662258] a standard reference serum sp007 available from the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for which concentration of IgG to each of the 
13seroty pes is known in µg /mL.
Anti -FHA ELISA ( Bordetella pertussis , Filamentous Hemaglutinin Ab.IgG)
Antibody  responses against FHA will be quantified by  [CONTACT_662259] I as coating. The 
antigen is coated onto a 96-wells microplate. After a washing and a blocking step, 
dilutions of serum samples, controls and standard are incubated on the coated plate. The 
microplate is washed and mouse HorseRadishPeroxidase ( HRP )-conjugated anti- human 
IgG monoclonal antibodies are added. After incubation, unbound antibodi es are removed 
by [CONTACT_662260] (TMB) i s incubated to reveal the enzy me activity . 
Color reaction is stopped by  [CONTACT_662261] d and the resulting yellow colo r is 
measured spectrophotometricall y.
The intensity  of the color is dir ectly  proportional to the concentration of the anti- FHA 
antibodies present in the sample.

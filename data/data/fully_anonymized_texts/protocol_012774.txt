Preventing Cognitive Decline   Version 1.[ADDRESS_973471] Alzheimer’s Disease (AD),  at a cost to society of more than 
$[ADDRESS_973472]  limited efficacy. It is imperative 
to develop evidence -based programs to help promote cognitive functioning  in older adults . We propose 
to address this urgent and critical public health issue by [CONTACT_213083] a brief evidence -
based mindfulness intervention  – Integrative Body -Mind Training (IBMT)  in old adults with SCD through 
randomized  clinical trials (RCTs). We will examine if the interv ention can improve behavioral and cognitive 
functioning, as well as brain changes in these older adults.  Outcomes from this study will inform  
prevention and  treatment option to promote health and well -being for individuals with SCD, MCI, and 
ADRD.  
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the self -reported perception of memory or cognitive problems, is a risk 
factor for the development of clinical cognitive  decline such as MCI and ADRD. Since SCD manifests prior 
to the onset of clinical impairment, it might provide  an optimal stage of time at which to intervene with 
preventive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_714703].49-[ADDRESS_973473] mindfulness studies on 
cognitive decline are cross -sectional, which are highly susceptible to confounds  and noises. 73-75. Previous 
SCD studies showed brain functional and structural abnormalities are associated with clinical progression 
and annual decline on  executive functioning, attention, memory, and global cognition. 66-72. Self-control 
and attention deficits can be improved  through brief intervention.  Our preliminary RCTs in healthy adults 
provide supp ort for our clinical trial by [CONTACT_714712]-control, attention, cognitive 
functioning, emotion,  stress reduction,  and quality of life following brief IBMT intervention, 1-45 suggesting 
its potential effectiveness in older  adults with SCD.  
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
The study includes behavioral, cognitive, and brain assessments, as well as mindfulness -based 
intervention.  
Behavioral and Cognitive Assessments  
• Immediate risks:  Potential boredom from completing the questionnaires and interviews.  
• Long -term risks:  Data including self -report, questionnaires and interview  involve risk of  breaches 
in confidentiality . 
• Alternative procedures: There are no other available alternative procedures to assess behavior and 
cognition, since to assess the behavior and cognition, we have to use the actual assessments. To 
minimize immediate risks, breaks in between questionnaires and interviews are offered to reduce 
Preventing Cognitive Decline   Version 1.1

 7 boredom. To minimize long -term risks, a ll information about the specific individuals will be 
maintained as confidential. Absolutely no names of subjects are used in published reports or in 
presentations in scientific meetings. All data will be kept in locked files and digital media in the PI’s 
laboratory. Reference to individual subject data will be made with a number and letter code for 
each subject. Any risks to participants are minimal and are outweighed by [CONTACT_714713].  
Brain  Assessments  
• Immediate risks: Potential boredom from completing the MRI scan, t he possibility of becoming 
uncomfortable in the enclosed space of the scanner.  
• Long -term risks:  MRI d ata involve s risk of breaches in confidentiality . 
• Alternative procedures: There are no other available alternative procedures to brain, since to 
assess the brain, we have to use the actual MRI assessments.  
 
Mindfulness -based Intervention  
• Immediate risks: Potential boredom from completing the intervention .  
• Long -term risks:  No known risk  based on our previous studies  1-12. 
• Alternative procedures: There are no other available alternative procedures, since the goal is to 
test the effects of the mindfulness -based intervention. To minimize immediate risks, breaks during 
the session are offered to reduce boredom.  
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Immediate potential benefits  
The immediate potential benefits from participant in this study includ e that participants generally 
find the experimental paradigms enjoyable (i.e. meditation state) during the intervention sessions

risks, all information about the specific individuals will be maintained as confidential. Absolutely no names 
of subjects are used in published reports or in presentations in scientific meetings. All data will be kept in 
locked files and digital  media in the PI’s laboratory. Reference to individual subject data will be made with

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
The study is a randomized control trial (RCT) involving two groups – IBMT (Arm 1: experimental 
manipulation) and health education (HE)  (Arm 2: control group) group. Participants in each group  will 
be assessed at baseline, post -intervention, and at 3-month follow -up using behavioral, cognitive, and 
brain assessments as described in Section 1.3 . Automatic  randomization will be conducted by [CONTACT_714714]/group condition  using an algorithm before the 
baseline assessment . This randomization procedure ensures balance between groups on gender while 
also balancing total treatment numbers .  
Preventing Cognitive Decline   Version 1.[ADDRESS_973476] meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form  
2. Males and females; Age 40-65 years old.  
3. Able to read/understand English  
4. Normal performance using standardized cognitive tests  
5. Self-reported decline in cognitive capacity such as memory loss  
6. Eligible for non -invasive fMRI  
7. Willing to be randomized  
8. Free of any severe psychiatric diagnoses or medication that may affect participation  
5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:  
 
1. Medical disorders or medications that affect the central and autonomic nervous system; or a 
positive pregnancy test result (females)  
2. Unable to provide consent or understand study procedures due to mental illness or cognitive 
limitations  
3. Previous meditation experiences  
4. Evidence of illicit drug use  
5. Metal or metallic materials in the body such as pacemaker

5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study  but are not 
subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Individuals  who do not meet the 
criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of meeting one or more exclusion criteria that 
are likely to change over time may be rescreened. Examples include the successful removal of metal 
devices that previously made them ineligible for a n MRI scan. Rescreened participants will be assigned 
the same participant number as for the initial screening.  
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
We anticipate to enroll 40 participants (males and females) ages from 40 to 65 years old across different 
race and ethnicity based on local demographic characteristics . Subjects will be recruited through print and 
media ads within local community . This will include radio and online ads and recruitment through social 
media. Flyers will be distributed throughout the local community. Based on our and other’s previous  
experiences in longitudinal studies, about 5 -10% of participants will dropout over the study period  
due to illness or relocation. We plan a dropout rate of 10% for this brief intervention. We  
propose to recruit 40 older adults of which 36 (90 %) will complete the study.   
Compensation and Retention. Participants will be financially compensated with $ 300 in total for 
completing the study protocol (approximately for 15 hours of time); participants who only partially 
complete the protocol will be compensated  based on prorated hours . To maximize participant retention 
we will maintain contact [CONTACT_213090] (e.g., requiring a 
functioning phone number and email address to contact [CONTACT_213091], and 
obtaining  the name, address, and phone number of at least [ADDRESS_973477] them during the study; emails 
and reminder phone calls prior to all study visits; offer flexib le scheduling options for assessment (including 
weekends); provide fair compensation to participants;  and maintain positive relations with participants. 
These procedures were used to maintain adequate participant retention in our prior NIH studies.  
6 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  ADMINISTRATION  
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  DESCRIPTION  
Experimental Manipulation – IBMT (Arm 1):  IBMT emphasizes the cooperation  
between body and mind in facilitating and achieving a meditative state ecologically. 1-7,[ADDRESS_973478] providing a  brief period to induce a cognitive or emotional state that will facilitate 
Preventing Cognitive Decline   Version 1.1  
Protocol 0 622202 2  22 June  2022 
 
Based on the NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 11 the training. Then, coach helps subjects  find an appropriate and balanced body posture and follow 
instructions to achieve deeper levels of relaxed body  (physiology of relaxation) and experience a restful 
feeling and mental quiet (psychology of relaxation) mindfully.  
When the mind wanders, the coach helps subjects accept and be open to experiences without judgment, 
and further guides subjects to use a favorite mental image as a tool to return to the present moment 
gently. At last,  the coach facilitates a bri ef group discussion to ensure subjects having positive experiences 
consistent with the  intent of IBMT. The method stresses no effort to control thoughts, but instead 
emphasizes a state of restful  alertness that allows a high degree of awareness of the body, mind, and 
environment. 1-7,18 -22 
Control Intervention  – Health Education  (Arm 2): For HE, each session includes pre -, post - and practice 
sessions, similar to IBMT procedure  and is facilitated by a trained coach . However, HE involves teaching 
participants different health promotion skills , behavior, attitude  and strategies , which are guided by [CONTACT_714715].  Participants have an active group experience that is not mindfulness -related. Therefore, 
HE induces a comparable but different experience  and could serve as an ideal active control. Moreover , 
other groups  have been using HE as active control in RCTs  involving mindfulness intervention as an active 
control condition . 2,7,64,65  
6.1.2  ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
Both arms of interventions will be administered as a group by [CONTACT_146221]. Both interventions 
will have 10 consecutive group sessions, and the completion of all 10 sessions is considered to be having a 
“full -dose” intervention. Participants in the same arm /group  will interact with a shared interventionist.  
6.[ADDRESS_973479] a minimum of a  master’s degree in 
psychology, social work, or a related field and experience running group therapy. The  coach will need to 
meet additional criteria: have completed the trainer course, had a daily practice of  mindfulness, and 
attended a silent meditation retreat. To monitor coach’s adherence and competence, all  sessions will be 
recorded and a random sample of 10% will be rated by [CONTACT_714716], and to 
prevent drift.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS : RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
To minimize potential biases, participants are randomized based on automatic  covariate conducted by [CONTACT_15957] -
I using an adaptive  algorithm . Participants are blinded to the intervention. Specifically, they were told that 
they will be engaged in body -mind intervention, without knowing whether or not the intervention they 
received is the experimental manipulation or control intervention. See methods of analysis in Section 9, 
Statistical Considerations  for details on randomization . Additionally, research staff who assesses 
participants are also blinded of the participants’ intervention condition. Randomization code is maintained 
by [CONTACT_714717] . A planned breaking of randomization code and blinding would occur  for any 
Preventing Cognitive Decline   Version 1.1  
Protocol 0 622202 2  22 June  2022 
 
Based on the NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 12 participants  who reported serious adverse eve nts. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -I will identify which group the participant 
is in, without the need for research staff to be involved in knowing the participant’s intervention group.  
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  ADHERENCE  
Participants’ adherence  with study procedures will be tracked  by [CONTACT_213094] . Moreover, i n each session, we use  participant  self-report and coach observation to calculate study 
intervention adherence  by [CONTACT_213095] .

PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
If a clinically sig nificant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after 
enrollment, the investigator or quali fied designee will determine if any change in participant management 
is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE) . 
 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:  
• The reason(s) for discontinuing the participant from the intervention, and methods for 
determining the need to discontinue  
• If the participant is due to complete assessments within 1 weeks of being discontinued from the 
study intervention, those assessments will be administered at the time of discontinuation; if the next 
scheduled assessments are more than 1 week from the discontinuation date, the next scheduled 
assessment  will not be administered . Thereafter, the participant will be  not included in all future 
scheduled assessments, as they did not participat e in the intervention.  
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
Participant s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non-compliance , unless varying compliance is an aspect of the study 
objectives   
• Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130]  (see Section 7.3, Lost to Follow -Up) 
• Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that continued collection of follow -up  
study data would not be in the best interest of the participant  or might require an additional 
treatment that would confound the interpretation of the study  
Preventing Cognitive Decline   Version 1.1  
Protocol 0 622202 2  22 June  2022 
 
Based on the NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 13 • The participant  meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
 
The reason for participant discontinuation  or withdrawal from the study will be recorded . Subjects who 
sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be 
replaced. Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and receive the study 
intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are discontinued from the study, will not be  replaced.

• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299] , reschedule the missed visit within 1 week , counsel 
the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the 
participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, 
a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods) .  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary rea son o f lost to follow -up.

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
This protocol uses the definition of a dverse event from 21 CFR 312.32 (a) : any untoward medical 
occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention -
related . 
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
This protocol uses the definition of serious adverse event includes: (a) Death; (b)  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or 
prolonged) ; (c) Life -threatening condition; (d) Disability or Permanent Damage ; (e) Other Serious 
(Important Medical Events) . 
 
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severi ty.  
 
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.   Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
 
All adverse events ( AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention , 
assessed  by [CONTACT_9152] -trained clinician  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical 
judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study procedures , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study procedures  caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
Preventing Cognitive Decline   Version 1.[ADDRESS_973482] a causal 
relationship between the study procedures  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the study procedures  caused the event, 
there is no temporal relationship between the study procedures  and event onset , or an alternate 
etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
A clinician with appropriate expertise in medical care  will be responsible for determining whether an 
adverse event ( AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, 
or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study 
procedures . 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs , not otherwise precluded per the protocol,  will be captured on the appropriate  case report form  
(CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
severit y, relationship to study procedures  (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] 
a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_9111] . 
 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_213077] 7 (for 
non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At each study visit, the 
investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for 
outcome informati on until resolution or stabilization.

8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by t he Office for Human Research 
Protections ( OHRP ).  OHRP  considers unanticipated problems involving risks to  participant s or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.

Based on the NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 17 8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM S REPORTING  
The investigator  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and t o the Data Coordinating C enter ( DCC)/lead principal investigator ( PI). The UP report will include 
the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number  
• A detailed description of the event, i ncident, experience, or outcome   
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP 
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study 
sponsor /funding agency  within 10 business days  of the investigator becoming aware of the event .  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor /funding agency  within 10 
business days  of the investigato r becoming aware of the problem   
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for 
Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) within 10 business days  of the  IRB’s receipt of the report of 
the problem from the investigator .

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
• Primary Endpoint(s):   
We hypothesize that, compared to participants  who receive a control intervention , participants  who 
receive IBMT  for improving behavior and cognition will have improved working memory, emotion 
regulation, and reduced subjective report of cognitive decline  after completing the intervention at 
post -assessment, and will continue to show improvement [ADDRESS_973487] -assessment or after 3 month s of 
intervention . 
 
• Secondary Endpoint(s):  
Preventing Cognitive Decline   Version 1.[ADDRESS_973488] in healthy older adults showed significant effects on quality of life (N=25) and in 
resting state functional connectivity and structural changes in the ACC/mPFC -Striatum networks following 
IBMT (N=13) 4; In adults, we detected significant fMRI signal changes in the ACC/mPFC (Cohen’s d= .90) 
after [ADDRESS_973489] size of IBMT without utilizing an unreasonable amoun t of resources in this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. Specifically, 40 subjects will give us adequate statistical power (80%) to detect a medium effect size 
[f= 0.3 for ANOVA and h=0.6 for proportion difference] with alpha=0.[ADDRESS_973490] would be less 
statistically powerful; however, as the nature of this project is exploratory, we are interested in 
determining the potential effect size of intervention and in develop ing our intervention protocol in older 
adults before testing it in a larger sample size.  
Given the [ADDRESS_973491] -intervention and follow -up and power considerations, the N of 40 
we choose is also in line with our intervention cycles and capacities.  
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
The analysis population will be Modified Intention -to-Treat Analysis Population. Specifically, these 
participants are those who completed the full -dose of the intervention (10 sessions) and have 
complete  and usable  data for the primary endpoints.  
9.[ADDRESS_973492] size measures (from the repeated -
measures ANOVA, Cohen’s d highlighting mean differences be tween treatment and control groups 
across assessments) will also be calculated to describe the intervention’s effect on study outcomes.  
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Preventing Cognitive Decline   Version 1.[ADDRESS_973493] trials will be calculated for each trial for all endpoints . For behavioral 
assessment of emotion regulation, mindfulness, and SCD, these  self-report  questionnaires will be 
calculated based on established scoring guides  by [CONTACT_714718] a given questionnaire  for all 
endpo ints. Next, the effects of intervention (IBMT vs. HE) on each of these primary endpoints will be 
examined using repeated -measures ANOVA with time x group interaction effect. Variance and covariance 
across repeated measures will be calculated as part of the ANOVA. Age and sex will be included as 
covariates to control for potential confounding effects of age and sex on behavioral and cognitive 
assessments. Results will be presented as F values for the interaction effect, along with p values to indicate 
statistical significance . Normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions will be checked using SPSS 
built -in tools for ANOVA.  Because there are [ADDRESS_973494] correction.  Missing data will be handled with case -wise deletion.  
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
The secondary endpoints are brain  assessments and are all repeated measures assessed at baseline, post -
intervention, and 3-month follow -up. For brain  assessment of white matter , white matter integrity  metrics 
will be calculated for all endpoints  based on standardized processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_714704] -based white 
matter data  using FSL ( http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl ). For brain assessment of grey matter, cortical 
thickness and volume metrics will be calculated for all endpoints  based on standardized processing 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_714705]12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) . For brain assessment of 
functional connectivity, pair-wise correlations of fMRI timeseries will be calculated for  regions of interest 
and for  all endpoints based on standardized processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_714706] 
(www.restfmri.net ). After these  data preprocessing and calculation, numerical values will be generated 
for all secondary endpoints (white matter, grey matter, and functional connectivity). Next, the effects of 
intervention (IBMT vs. HE) on each of these secondary endpoints will be examined using repeated -
measures ANOVA with time x group interaction effect. Variance and covariance across repeated measures 
will be calculated as part of the ANOVA. Age and sex will be included as covariates to control for potential 
confounding e ffects of age and sex on brain function and structure . Results will be presented as F values 
for the interaction effect, along with p values to indicate statistical signif icance. Normality and 
homogeneity of variance assumptions will be checked using SPSS built -in tools for ANOVA. Because there 
are [ADDRESS_973495] correction.  
Missing data will be handled with case -wise deletion.

   Title of research study  (clinical trial) : Modulation effects of a novel body -mind intervention on subjective 
cognitive decline  
Investigator: [CONTACT_103529]-Yuan Tang , College of Health Solutions  
Why am I being invited to take part in a clinical trial ? 
We invite  you to participate  because  you are healthy (free of  any severe neurological and psychiatric diagnoses , having a 
self-reported cognitive decline ) between 40 - 65 years old.  Meanwhile,  you are a ble to read/understand English  and 
eligible for non -invasive fMRI , have  normal or corrected -to-normal vision , weigh at least  110 lbs , and are willing to be 
randomized . 
Why is this clinical trial  being done ? 
Cognitive decline  may involve deficits in self -control networks and integrative body -mind training (IBMT)  could improve  
self-control , which may help reduce cognitive decline . The purpose of this study is to investigate brain and body  
mechanisms and the effects of reducing cognitive decline  following IBMT . This work will improve our understanding of  
how training may affect brain,  performance and behavior , and we are hopeful that it  will have  an eventual  impact  of  
preventing and reducing cognitive decline  in this group.  
How long will the clinical trial  last? 
We invite  you to complete  5 onsite visits  (each  approximately  1 hour long).  Visits  will be scheduled roughly 1-6 month s apart. 
The study is anticipated to spread across 12 month s total (including 10 remote visits).  
How many people will be studied?  
We expect  about  120 people.  
What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this clinical trial ? 
It is up to you to decide whether or not to participate. Consenting to participate in this study will take place remotely 
over Zoom or by [CONTACT_648], prior to engaging in research activities.  
Eligibility Screen : you will be screened 5-10 min to make sure to meet the study eligibility criteria through Qualtrics or 
Redcap. If you meet criteria, you will be marked as “conditionally eligible” for study and move forward with the consent 
process on zoom. If not, participation in this clinical trial will stop at this time . 
Consent ing: You will meet with the research staff on zoom to review the study consent form.  
There  are 3 parts of this clinical trial :  
Part 1 . Surve y and tasks : You will complete questionnaires and tasks related to cognition, emotion and health  through 
Qualtrics or Redcap  (about 60 min) . If you have technical issues with Qualtrics or Redcap, we will guide you either via 
Zoom or in person .  
Part 2. Five Brain MRI scans will occur  at Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI)  and consist of [ADDRESS_973508]. Tang’s 
study staff . This study does not aim to provide diagnosis, if MRI shows an abnormality, MRI technologist may suggest you see 
a doctor.  
Part 3. Interventions : You will be randomly assigned  to complete  one intervention condition of this study ( 10 sessions with 
about 60 min/session ). Interventions  will be guided on zoom .  
We will ask for your permission to contact [CONTACT_216170]; however , this is not necessary to  participate  in the 
current project.  
What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?  
You can leave at any time it will not be held against you.  If you decide to leave, contact [CONTACT_714721]. A lready collected data may not be removed from the database.  
  Is there any way being in this clinical trial  could be bad for me ? 
There is very little risk to you for participation in this study  including questionnaires, MRI and intervention s. As part of the 
fMRI scan, you will be continuously monitored throughout the scan. If you have claustrophobia  or a pacemaker or some 
metal objects in your body, you will not be allowed to be in this study because of the strong magnetic  fields in the MRI 
scanner. Another risk is the possibility of metal objects being pulled into the magnet and potentially hitting you. To 
eliminate this risk, you will need to remove anything metal from your clothes, any metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_2982], and anything metal from 
your pockets. You will also walk through a metal detector (like airport scanners) when you come into the magnet chamber. 
It is important to know that no metal can be brought into the magnet room at any time. Once you are in the scanner, the 
door to the room will be closed so that no metal from outside accidentally goes near the magnet.   If you are pregnant, you 
should delay your participation in this clinical trial . 
Will being in this study help me anyway ? 
We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this clinical trial , and do not anticipate any direct 
benefits to you. However, th e overall goal of this clinical trial  is to improve our understanding of how training may affect brain, 
performance and behavior. Thus,  there  is a potential  benefit  to improve  brain function and change behavior such as reduc ing 
cognitive decline  through  information  gained in  this project.   
What happens to the information collect ed for the clinical trial ? 
Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information to people who need  to review this 
information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your  information include the 
Institutional Review Board and other representatives of this organization. The results may be used in reports, 
presentations, and publications  but will not be reported back to you. If the results of the trial are  published,  your identity  will 
remain  confidential.  For confidentiality  purposes,  your identity will be linked to a code number . A master list will be kept to 
link your name [CONTACT_714725]. The master  list, which contains  your identity will be stored in 
secured computers and will be retained  indefinitely.  De-identified data collected as a part of the current clinical trial  will not 
be shared with other investigators/industry sponsors for future research purposes . 
 
What else do I need to know?  
ASU  Lab COVID -19 Procedures:  
• We are required to do symptom checks 24 -48 hours prior to your appointment and will also perform  another  
symptom  check  and temperature  check  using  a touchless  thermometer  upon  arrival  at the lab 
• Lab disinfections are performed at the beginning and end of the lab work day by [CONTACT_714722]  
• Both research  team  and you are required  to wear  masks  when  inside  ASU building  and within     ASU 
community spaces, if you forget to bring one to your appointment, we can provide a disposable  mask  
• Only you will be permitted  to enter  the building.  If needed,  you may have  one person  accompany  them  to their 
appointments  and will be subject  to the same safety  protocols.  
• We will minimize the number  of people in the lab at a given time. We plan to have two researchers in the   lab

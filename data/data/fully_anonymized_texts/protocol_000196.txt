Contains  trade  secrets  and/or  confidential  information  exempt  from disclosure  from 21 CFR 20.61   1. Background and Rationale 
The management of type 1 diabetes (T1D) can be complex, burdensome, and frustrating,  
requiring multiple tests of blood glucose levels daily, multiple injections of insulin (or  
manual dosing of an insulin pump), and monitoring of physical activity and carbohydrate  
intake. Real -time adjustments must be made on a daily basis for unplanned activities or  
foods, illness, and emotional factors that impact blood glucose levels; and even with  
adherence to the most rigid food, exercise, blood glucose, and insulin administration  
schedules,  inherent pharmacological  and physiological variability  results  in glucose swings 
out of desirable,  or even  safe, ranges.  In no group of people is this more problematic than 
in young children, in whom eating and physical activity levels are highly variable and 
unpredictable, sensitivity to insulin renders small errors in insulin  dosing prone to 
dangerous swings in blood glucose levels, and awareness of symptoms to warn of 
impending hypoglycemia or abili ty to effectively communicate this awareness is  limited. 
Furthermore, most, if not all, diabetes management tasks in this age group must  be 
performed  by [CONTACT_2312]: for the most  part, parents  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_377141]), but also baby[CONTACT_377159], 
other adult caregivers , and school personnel. At the same  time,  the demonstrated, well-
known adverse neurological effects  of hypoglycemia, and the increasingly apparent 
adverse consequences of hyperglycemia on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866],  raise the stakes for good 
control even higher in this population, who must live the longest  with the burden of  
diabetes.  
Many  parents  cope with these  uncertainties  by [CONTACT_377160]. Research with mothers of young children describes this state as  one of “constant 
vigilance”. This sense of continuous responsibility to protect their child is especially 
burdensome during those early years, during which time pediatric parenting stress levels 
seem to be higher, particularly for mothers. Nighttime caregiving, including nocturnal 
blood sugar monitoring, is practiced by [CONTACT_377161] 40% of parents, and is  associated with 
sleep deficit and increased anxiety and stress. Nearly a quarter of mothers  of young children 
report clinically significant levels of anxiety and d epression, the levels  for which, not 
surprisingly, were highest for those who found it more upsetting to cope  with T1D -related 
stress. Moreover, parents who experience more frequent and difficult  T1D- related stress 
also tend to feel less confident in their  capacity to perform these tasks,  and have greater 
fear of hypoglycemia. There is evidence that over time, higher parental  depressive 
symptoms, and parent  stress,  are associated  with decreased  parent  involvement and greater 
family conflict. Taken together,  these data raise many red flags  about the impact the 
unremitting demands that T1D management can have on a parent’s  well-being, particularly  
mothers who still  tend to be primary  caretakers.  
Modern technological improvements have had limited success in improving diabetes  
management in this age group. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_377142]- term control of blood  
glucose, only 27% of  children  meet  the current  American  Diabetes  Association  and 
International Society  for Pediatric  and Adolescent  Diabetes  A1c target of < 7.5%.  
The artificial pancreas platform employed under study is centered about the following  four 
key innovations: 1) A zone model predictive control strategy that is at the same time  very 
safe with respect  to hypoglycemia, and can simultaneously and independently be 
Harvard/Yale  – IDE Application  Confidential  Appendix  E – Page  5  
Contains  trade  secrets  and/or  confidential  information  exempt  from disclosure  from [ADDRESS_471945] to its response to hyperglycemia; 2) Zone control with diurnal blood- 
glucose target zones; 3) Models of insulin- glucose physiology and insulin on board; 4) A  
system  for alarming  and notification  of impending hypoglycemia and technical  
malfunctions: the Health Monitoring System.  These features have been evaluated in  several  
clinical trials  in adults  with unannounced meals  and exercise.  
The proposed study will evaluate enhancements to our previous system tailored for the  
special needs of pediatric subjects: 1) A control strategy with responses to hyperglycemia  
and hypoglycemia spanning wide ranges, as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_377143]; 2) The use of time - 
dependent zones specific for pediatric subjects; 3) The development of models for young  
children, capturing the greater  physiologic variability,  and ensuring cautious insulin  
delivery; 4) remote  alarming  and notification  systems that  are useful to parents.  
 
 
2. Objectives  
The aim of this clinical study is to determine the feasibility, safety, and preliminary  
effectiveness  of the Zone-Model Predictive  Control Artificial Pancreas  (ZMPC_AP)  
system  in pediatric  subjects  with type 1 diabetes  in an ambulatory semi -supervised  
environment over a short duration of  3 days and 2 nights, or up to  60 hours.  
 
 
Figure 1. Outline  of the proposed  clinical  study.  
3. Study  Overview  
We will assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effectiveness of a Zone-Model 
Predictive Control Artificial Pancreas (ZMPC_AP) system in children and adolescents  
with type 1 diabetes.  The study will simulate children’s usual home environments,  
including meals of typi[INVESTIGATOR_377144], and will also include periods of  
afternoon exercise typi[INVESTIGATOR_377145] -school sports or other activities.  This study will utilize  
a “hybrid” closed -loop paradigm, in which  subjects  (or parents)  must  count the 
carbohydrate content of  the meals and  announce this to the system  at the time of the  meal.  
Subjects and parents will be free to travel within a 15- minute walking distance of  the study 
site, and they will sleep overnight in a local hotel, in which study personnel will  provide 
on-site supervision.  The duration of closed- loop control will be up to 60 hours.  The initial 
cohort will be comprised of adolescent subjects, age 12- 17y, and if successful  (i.e. no 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_48894]),  additional cohorts will consist  of progressively younger- age 
children  (8-<12y and then <8y).

c. Source of Subjects  
Subjects will be recruited from the clinic population at the Yale Children’s Diabetes  
Program who meet eligibility criteria.  Additional subjects may be recruited from local  
advertising and/or the website  clinicaltrials.gov.  Potential subjects  may be emailed  
information regarding the study, including copi[INVESTIGATOR_377147], and if interested 
will be invited to the  research  center  for formal enrollment.  
d. Consent  Process  
The principal investigators, co- investigators, or study coordinators will introduce the  
studies to eligible participants and their caretakers during routine medical visits or in the  
form of a mailing or phone call.  Prospective subjects/caretakers will have a face- to-face 
meeting with the investigator and/or study coordinator to address questions about the  study 
rationale,  procedures, risks and benefits.  In order to identify  and clarify  any 
misconceptions, parents/caretakers  will be encouraged to describe the research  procedures 
and their associated risks in their own words, followed by [CONTACT_377162].  All the subjects in the proposed studies  will be minors; 
parent/guardian permission will be obtained for all subjects; additionally,  for subjects  age 
[ADDRESS_471946]  assent  will also be obtained, as per Yale IRB guidelines.   The 
parents/caretakers of participants will be encouraged to ask questions  and will be clearly 
informed about the time required for these studies and their rights of  non- participation  
and/or withdrawal.  Caretakers/parents  will be given copi[INVESTIGATOR_377148].   
Since personal health information will be collected as part of  this research protocol, 
parents/caretakers will also be asked for authorization to collect  this information  in 
accordance with HIPAA  and Yale IRB  guidelines.  
e. Sample  Size 
We will enroll a convenience sample of 24 -48 subjects (8- 16 in each of the three age  
cohorts), the final number depending on whether additional cohorts needed to be repeated 
at any given age group.  There is no formal sample  size calculation  for this study. 
5. Study  Procedures  
The study will consist of two visits, separated by [CONTACT_377163]:  an enrollment  
visit and a  hotel visit.  
a. Enrollment  Visit  
Subjects  and parents/caregivers  invited  to participate  in the study will undergo the consent 
process as  described above,  and then have  the following  study procedures: 
1) Medical  History  
A medical history will be elicited from subjects/parents, focusing on current diabetes  
management issues, prior diabetes -related history (date of diagnosis, complications and  co-
morbidities),  history of adverse events  (severe hypoglycemia, DKA),  other past and 
Harvard/Yale  – IDE Application  Confidential  Appendix  E – Page  8  
Contains  trade  secrets  and/or  confidential  information  exempt  from disclosure  from 21 CFR 20.61   current medical problems, medications, and allergies.  For subjects already attending the  
Yale Children’s Diabetes Program, electronic medical records will be available for each  
subject.  For subjects not attending the Yale Children’s Diabetes Program, copi[INVESTIGATOR_377149].  Demographic data including age, sex, race/ethnicity will 
also be recorded.  Current pump settings, glucose meter and continuous glucose  monitor 
(CGM)  logs, will be  reviewed and recorded.  
2) Physical Examination  
A focused physical examination will be conducted on all subjects, including vital signs,  
anthropometrics, cardiac, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], abdo minal, and neurological systems, thyroid, skin 
(particularly  infusion sites), and pubertal staging.  
3) Laboratory Data  
Subjects’ previous laboratory records will be reviewed, and a point -of-care A1c will be  
obtained at the visit, to confirm eligibility.  Femal e subjects of childbearing potential will  
have a urine pregnancy test; those with a negative test will be invited to participate, and  
those with a  positive test will be  offered appropriate  counseling. 
4) CGM  Placement  
Subjects  will be fitted  with a DexCom sensor  for collection  of baseline glycemic  
profile data.  Subjects  already using a Dexcom  CGM  for their routine diabetes  care 
may continue to use their own sensors;  subjects  not using Dexcom  CGM  will be 
provided with one and instructed  on its proper use, including insertion, calibration,  
interpretation of data, recharging, and troubleshooting.  Subjects/parents will be reminded  
that ALL insulin  dosing decisions should continue to be made using capi[INVESTIGATOR_377150],  NOT  the sensor. Subjects  will be asked  to collect  
baseline CGM data  for up to two weeks.  
5) Blood Glucose  Meter  
Subjects will be provided with a study glucose meter, which should be used for ALL BG  
testing during the baseline data collection period, as well as for calibration of the CGM.  
Subjects  and parents  will be instructed  to test BG at least [ADDRESS_471947] one 
parent/guardian will return for a “hotel” visit, of up to 60 hours, during which time the  
following will occur:  
1) Initiation  of Closed -Loop 
Subjects  will retur n to study site in the morning of the day of admission, for review  of 
interim diabetes  control and uploading of pump, meter  and CGM  data.  Subjects’  current  
Harvard/Yale  – IDE Application  Confidential  Appendix  E – Page  9  
Contains  trade  secrets  and/or  confidential  information  exempt  from disclosure  from [ADDRESS_471948]-copy training  materials  to use as 
reference.  Before  leaving  the study facility,  subjects  will be required  to demonstrate 
competency with basic system operations, and successful operation of the  SMS alert 
system for subjects’ and staff cell phones will be ensured.   This training portion of the 
study may occur at the Yale Children’s Diabetes Research P rogram facility  or at a 
conference room at the  study hotel. 
2) Activities  During  Hotel Visit  
Subjects will be encouraged to participate in usual daily activities, including exercise,  
eating out, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], etc) as long as they remain within a 15- minute walking  radius of the  
study site, and they have a functioning cell phone with messaging capabilities.  There will  
be age- appropriate scheduled activities with the study group as well as personal “down- 
time.”  During the entire duration of this phase, subjects will be under direct supervision 
of a parent or study staff member at all times.  Subjects and parents will be required to  
return to hotel by [ADDRESS_471949]  safety  and will check subjects’  BG levels  at midnight each night. 
3) Exercise  
Subjects will be encouraged to participate in exercise activities each day during the hotel  
visit, such as walking, jogging, exercise room, or sports.  Exercise will not be announced to 
the controller, but subjects  that usually pre- treat exercise with small amounts of 
carbohydrate may continue to do so after discussion with study staff.  All subjects will 
check  BG levels prior  to and after  the planned exercise.  
4) Diabetes  Management  During  Hotel  Visit  
Subjects will continue to count carbohydrates for all meals and snacks and enter this  
amount into the controller of the closed- loop system.  For youngest age group (<8 y),  
manual pre -meal boluses  may not necessarily be  given, at discretion of the investigator,  to 
test the robustness of the system.  Subjects will not utilize “correction doses” for  
hyperglycemia except if  instructed by  [CONTACT_464].  
5) Hypoglycemia and H yperglycemia  Management  
Subjects and parents will be instructed to test BG on the study meter for any CGM  readings 
under 70 mg/dL or if subject develops symptoms of hypoglycemia.  For any  documented 
BG <70 mg/dL or in the setting of symptoms of hypoglycemia, study staff  will be alerted, 
subject will be treated with 15 -30 gm rapid- acting carbohydrate (such as  juice or glucose 
tabs), and BG will be rechecked in 15 minutes. Additional treatments for  hypoglycemia 
will be given every 15 minutes as needed until BG levels are ≥ 70 mg/dL.  For CGM  
readings ≥ 300 mg/dL for > [ADDRESS_471950] BG, and if confirmed  BG 
≥ 300 mg/dL, subject will test blood ketones. Subject or parent will contact [CONTACT_377164]  > 1.0 mmol/l  for instructions on supplemental insulin, 
Harvard/Yale  – IDE Application  Confidential  Appendix  E – Page  10  
Contains  trade  secrets  and/or  confidential  information  exempt  from disclosure  from 21 CFR 20.61   changing insertion site, and continuation of closed- loop control, as per the Treatment  
Protocol (Table  1). 
6) Remote  Monitoring  
Subjects’ parent/guardian and study staff will receive event -based SMS (text) alerts on  
their cell phones for low sensor  readings, or for other operational issues affecting  
performance of the system.  For these studies, the threshold for predictive hypoglycemia  
alerts will be set to 65 mg/dL.  If the hypo- alert is activated, subjects  will be required to 
test BG and communicate result to study staff.   If study staffs have received an SMS  alert, 
they will call subjects on their cell phone if they have not received a call from them  within 
15 minutes.  Subjects will be instructed to treat symptomatic hypoglycemia or  confirmed 
BG level < 70 mg/dL with 15- 30 grams of rapid -acting carbohydrate (such as  juice or 
glucose tabs), re -check BG level in 15 minutes, and repeat as necessary until BG  level is 
over 70 mg/dL.  Study staff will advise subj ect/caregiver whether to continue current 
diabetes management or exit closed -loop control, as per the Treatment Protocol  (Table  1). 
7) Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_377151] a confirmed BG < 50 mg/dL (separated by [CONTACT_223905] 30 minutes),  blood ketones  > 1.0  mmol/L for over 2  hours, or any blood ketone  level  
> 3.0 mmol/L,  then the study will be stopped for that subject.  Recall  that subject  will 
test for ketones after a confirmed BG ≥ 300 mg/dL following CGM readings ≥ 300  mg/dL 
for > [ADDRESS_471951] has a seizure, loss of consciousness or ketoacidosis  (CO 2 < 15 
mEq/L, or pH<7.3) the study will be stopped for that subject and no additional  subjects  will 
be enrolled  until the DSMB  reviews  the data.  
If for any subject the BG ≥ 300 mg/dL and blood ketones are > 1.0 mmol/L, the closed- 
loop control will be temporarily  stopped, the infusion site will be changed, and 
supplemental insulin may be given at the discretion of the investigator. The closed-loop control will be  restarted if  BG <250 mg/dL  and blood ketones <  0.6 mmol/L.  
If for any subject the BG ≥ 400 mg/dL for any ketone levels, the closed- loop control will  
also be temporarily stopped, the infusion site will be changed, and supplemental insulin  
may be given if the investigator c oncludes that the issue is related to a site failure and not 
due to malfunction of the controller. The closed- loop control will be restarted if BG <250  
mg/dL and blood ketones  < 0.6 mmol/L.

9) End of Hotel  Visit  
At the conclusion of the hotel visit (afternoon of 3rd day), subjects will return to their  usual 
pre-study insulin pump and regimen.  Study devices will be returned and uploaded  for data 
analysis.  Subjects  and parents  will participate in semi -structured  interviews  and/or focus 
groups to give opi[INVESTIGATOR_377152], confidence in system safety,  fear of 
hypoglycemia, and diabetes -related distress.  Study staff will call subjects/parents  
approximately 24 hours afte r discharge to review BG control and assess for late adverse  
events.  
10) Surveys  and Interviews  
Subjects and parents/caregivers will, at the conclusion of the hotel visit, complete several  
surveys/questionnaires to assess the effect of the closed -loop system on diabetes -related  
quality  of life and distress,  fear of hypoglycemia, and satisfaction  with diabetes  technology 
(see Table 2).  Subjects and caregivers will also participate in focus groups or  semi -
structured interviews related to human  factors issues, and perceived burdens and  benefits,  
of the closed -loop system.  Only  the interviewer  and participant(s)  will be present  during 
the interview/focus group.

6. Data  Analysis 
a. Primary  Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for the short- duration hotel study is safety, as defined as:  1) no  more 
than one confirmed BG < 50 mg/dL; 2) no more than two confirmed BG ≥ 300 mg/dL 
longer than 2 hours, unless determined to be from an infusion site failure; 3) no BG ≥ 400 
mg/dL; 4) no blood ketone level > 1.0 mmol/l for longer than 2 hours, or any ketone level  
>3.0 mmol/L,  unless determined  to be from  an infusion site failure;  and 5) no significant 
adverse events,  such as severe hypoglycemia (seizure,  loss of consciousness), diabetic  
ketoacidosis. 
 
b. Secondary  Endpoints  
Efficacy  endpoints of interest  will include: 
a. Mean  meter and  sensor  glucose 
b. % Time  in range (70- 180 mg/dL)  
c. % Time  below range (<70  mg/dL) 
d. % Time  above range (>180  mg/dL) 
e. % Time  in hypoglycemia (<60 mg/dL)  
f. % Time  in hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL) 
g. % time AP system  active  
 
The glycemic metrics will be calculated by [CONTACT_377165] 24 -hour period, and also broken down into 
daytime  (6AM -11PM) and nighttime  (11PM- 6AM)  periods. 
c. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_377154] a confirmed BG < 50 mg/dL (separated by [CONTACT_223905] 30 minutes),  blood ketones  > 1.0  mmol/L for over 2 hours, or any blood ketone  level 
> 3.0 mmol/L, then the study will be stopped for that subject. If any subject has a  seizure,  
loss of consciousness or ketoaci dosis (CO 2 < 15 mEq/L,  or pH<7.3) the study will be 
stopped for that subject  and no additional subjects  will be enrolled  until the DSMB  
reviews the data.

If stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_377155], then after that cohort is completed we  
will proceed to next lower age cohort after DSMB review and approval.   However, even  
if stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_377156], additional cohorts at a given age range may be enrolled at  
discretion  of investigators if adjustments  to algorithm tuning parameters  are desired  based 
on glycemic results and comparison with subjects’ pre -study baseline glycemic  profiles. 
 
 
7. Financial Considerations 
a. Subject  compensation 
 
Subjects/parents will receive $50 for the enrollment visit and $100/day for the hotel visit,  
for a maximum of  $[ADDRESS_471954]  meals  during the hotel stay will be covered  by [CONTACT_1758]. Parents  will receive 
$[ADDRESS_471955] medical occurrence that  
meets  criteria  for a serious adverse event  or any medical  occurrence (expected  or 
unexpected) in a study participant that is study  or device- related.  
Hypoglycemic events are recorded as adverse events if the event required assistance of  
another person due to altered consciousness and required another person to ac tively  
administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions to prevent harm. This  
means that the subject was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat 
his or herself, was unable to verbalize his or her needs, was incoherent, disoriented,  and/or 
combative,  or experienced  seizure or coma.  These  epi[INVESTIGATOR_377157].  If glucose measurements are not 
available during such an event, neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of  
glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low  
plasma  glucose concentration. 
Hyperglycemic events  are recorded  as adverse  events  if the event  involved diabetic  
ketoacidosis, as def ined by [CONTACT_333054],  and had all of  the following: 
• Symptoms such as  polyuria, polydipsia, nausea,  or vomiting; 
• Serum  ketones or large/moderate  urine ketones; 
Harvard/Yale  – IDE Application  Confidential  Appendix  E – Page  15  
Contains  trade  secrets  and/or  confidential  information  exempt  from disclosure  from 21 CFR 20.61   • Either  arterial  blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24  or serum  bicarbonate <15;  and 
• Treatment  provided in a health  care facility  
 
b. Recording  of adverse  events  
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made to remain alert to possible  
adverse events  or untoward findings. The first concern  will be the safety  of the participant, 
and appropriate medical intervention will be made.  The study investigator  will assess the 
relationship of any adverse event to be related or unrelated by [CONTACT_377166].  
The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a three- point scale: mild, moderate, or  
severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus a severe adverse 
event is not necessarily serious.  For example, itching for several days may be  rated  as 
severe, but may  not be  clinically  serious.  
Adverse events that continue after the participant’s discontinuation or completion of the  
study will be followed until their medical outcome is determined or until no further  change 
in the  condition is expected.  
c. Reporting  serious  or unexpected  device- related events  
A serious adverse  event is  any untoward occurrence  that: 
• Results  in death  
• Is life-threatening; (a non life-threaten ing event  which,  had it been more severe,  might 
have become life- threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse  event)  
• Requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2850]  
• Results  in significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
d. Unanticipated  adverse device event  
An unanticipated adverse device event is defined as an adverse event caused by, or  
associated with, a device, if that effect or problem was not previously identified in nature,  
severity,  or degree  of incidence.  
Serious or unexpected adverse events must be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97318].   The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_377158], DMSB, FDA, and device manufacturer of any adverse device  event 
that is both serious and unexpec ted. Notification will be made within [ADDRESS_471956] (DSMB)  
Drs. Dassau and Weinzimer will convene a Data Safety Monitoring Board, (DSMB),  
comprised of independent clinicians experienced in the management of young children 
with type [ADDRESS_471957]/Yale  – IDE Application  Confidential  Appendix  E – Page  16  
Contains  trade  secrets  and/or  confidential  information  exempt  from disclosure  from [ADDRESS_471958]  cohorts, for their input 
on safety, before any subjects are enrolled, in order to approve the  monitoring  plans for  
each study  phase at their  start.

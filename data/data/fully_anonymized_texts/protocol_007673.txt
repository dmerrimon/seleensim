General Study Design:
This is a 24- week treatment, multicenter, open -label, randomized, parallel group comparison 
feasibility  study  of SoC treatment versus th e using the eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16852], including inhaler, App, DHP 
(Cloud solution), and dashboard, to optimize outcomes in patients at least [ADDRESS_16089] of a screening/baseline visit (Visit 1), a 24- week, open -label treatme nt 
period with Visit 2 (either in- person or remote) at Week 12 and Visit 3 at Week 24, and a follow -
up telephone call (2 weeks following treatment completion or earl y termination). 
Patients with suboptimal asthma control will be enrolled in the study  and randomized, in a 4:3 
ratio, respectively , to 1 of 2 parallel groups ( Table 2). The randomization will be stratified by

The DS group patients will use the FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16853] a common App, 
DHP (Cloud s olution), and dashboard. The SoC group patients, who will include eligible patients 
treated with their current treatment provided b y the investigational center to the patient, based on 
asthma guidelines, will not use the DS during the treatment period. Similar data will be collected 
regarding outcomes for bo th groups: ACT after [ADDRESS_16091] a screening/baseline visit (Visit 1), at which they  will be asked if they  own 
a smart device and use different applica tions on their smartphones. A baseline ACT score for all 
patients and BMQ, BIPQ, Mini- AQLQ, and WPAI questionnaire responses, for patients 18 years 
of age or older, will be collected. At Visit 1, patients in the DS group will be trained on the use 
of the eMDPI (including instructions on how to use both the eMDPIs and the App). U pon 
demonstrating competency , patients in the DS group will have their maintenance ICS with 
LABA switched to the FS eMDPI  (at a dose of fluticasone comparable to their most recent 
current ICS dose) and their rescue treatment switched to the Albuterol eMDPI . All other asthma 
maintenance medications, except for ICS with L ABA, may  be continued. The iHCP can add 
another controller medication other than an ICS with L ABA, including a biolog ic, to the DS 
patient’s treatment, if needed. Patients in the SoC group will be reimbursed or given a voucher to 
use to purchase their existing maintenance ICS with L ABA and rescue medications. Patients in 
the DS group will receive a new FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16854] [ADDRESS_16092]- to- patient (DTP) shipments, after Visit 1, the investigational 
center will receive periodic email reminders to access the interactive response technology  (IRT)

required before the next shipment can be sent.
Investigational centers will receive similar instruction regarding features of the App, as well as 
features of the associated common dashboard, which mirrors the digital information obtained

associated inspi[INVESTIGATOR_16855].
The SoC group will be followed according to the clinical judgment of t he investigator; the 
asthma of patients in the SoC group will be managed in a manner consistent with the clinical 
judgement of the investigator and based on asthma management guidelines (eg, Global Initiative 
for Asthma). Similar to the management of the S oC group, the DS group patients will be 
followed b y the investigational centers with the addition of objective information on FS eMDPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_16856], respectivel y. The iHCPs will check the dashboard at least once a 
week and use this information, along with an y other additional information about the patient, as 
per their clinical judgement, to modify  patients’ asthma management. The investigator may , if
indicated, modify  the patient’s regime, including adding asthma controllers or biologics as 
otherwise clinicall y indicated in the judgement of the investigator. Clinically Driven 
Assessments for both groups, if necessary , should be arranged, per the clini cal judgement of the 
iHCP managing the patient, and can be via a telephone call or an on -site visit.
For all patients, at Visit 2, Visit 3, and any  Clinically  Driven Assessment, the iHCP will record 
answers to Asthma Management questions, including discuss ions regarding adherence, or inhaler 
technique, treatment adjustments, or additions of new treatments, including biologic medication 
usage. Additionally , in the case of a Clinicall y Driven Assessment (for patients in the DS group), 
the iHCP will be asked whether or not the contact [CONTACT_16941]. 
Visit 2 (if it is an in- person visit) will include dispensing of new inhalers to the DS group 
patients and return of used or unused inhalers that were dispensed to the patients previously . 
New FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16857] y to patients periodically after Vi sit2 
until the end of treatment. The ACT will be completed and scores registered.
At the end of the treatment period (24 weeks), final assessments of the DS and SoC groups will 
be completed, as specified in Table 5, and the rest of the inhalers that were dispensed to the DS 
group patients will be returned
. A follow -up telephone call will be made by  [CONTACT_16942], [ADDRESS_16093] returned to 
their previous asthma treatments.
It should also be noted that no specific clinical decisions are being mandated. One secondary 
objective of this study  is to describe how clinicians actually  use the information provided by  [CONTACT_16943].
Method of Randomization and Blinding:
Patients will be randomly  assigned to the DS group or SoC group in a 4:3 ratio, stratified by  
[CONTACT_16940], respectively , using a Randomizat ion and Trial Supply
 Management 
system. 
This is an open -label study , therefore blinding is not applicable.

Statistical Considerations
This section describes the statistical anal ysis as foreseen at the time of planning the study . 
Changes, additions, and further details about the analy ses will be described in the Statistical 
Analy sisPlan. After finalization of the Statistical Analy sis Plan, any  additional anal yses or 
changes to analy ses that may  be required will be fully  disclosed in the clinical study report 
(CSR).
Sample Size Rationale:
The sample size was selected based on a Bay esian approach which allows for a range of 
underly ing proportions rather than a fixed predefined value.
A total of 388 patients will be enrolled in the study (accounting for 10% early dropouts), 
200patients in the DS group and 150 patients in the SoC group, to be available for anal ysis. The 
sample size determination was made assuming binomial distribution for the primary  endpoint. 
An informative prior the for SoC group (Beta [9.52, 11.88]) was selected to reflect the belief that 
the response rate of the SoC group is between 30% and 60% (most likel y 45%, Merchant 2016 ) 
and the effect size between groups of 13% difference in response rates was considered clinically  
meaningful. 
In addition, an informative prior for the SoC group was selected to ensure that the mean square 
error for the Bay es estimate from the informative prior is superior to the maximum likelihood 
estimate over a range of 30% and 60% of anticip ated proportion for SoC group.
It should be noted that both power and T ype 1 error are dependent on the absolute difference 
between the DS and the SoC groups as illustrated in Figure 1below b y the operational 
characteristics calculated for the stud y design.

A non -infor mative prior (Beta [0.5,0.5]) for the DS group was selected due to lack of availabilit y 
of data in the DS group.
With assumptions of response rates of 58% and 45% for the DS and SoC groups, respectivel y, 
sample size and randomization ratio, the probability of the posterior odds ratio (OR) of 
improvement (ie, OR>1) for the DS group versus the SoC group of at least 0.95 is about 82%. 
This will ensure a 1- sided 5% Ty pe 1 error rate and 78% power for an effect size for 13% 
difference between the groups provided that the proportion of responders in the SoC group is 
45%. 
Analysis Sets
Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set (ITT): The ITT analy sis set will include all randomized patients. 
In the ITT analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were 
randomized, regardless of which treatment they  actually  received. This analy sis population will 
be used for summarization of patient disposition and demographic and base line characteristics, 
as appropriate.
Modified Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set (mITT): The mITT analy sis set is a subset of the ITT 
analysis set including only  patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP (IMP is either FS eMDPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_16860], or SoC medication for the SoC group) and at least 
1postbaseline assessment on any  of the study  endpoints. 
In the m ITT analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients 
were randomized, regardless of which treatment t hey actuall y received. This analysis will be 
used for all primary , secondary ,  endpoint analy ses.
Safety Analysis Set: The safet y analysis set will include all patients in the DS group who 
receive at least 1 dose of IMP and all patients in t he SoC group. In the safety anal ysis set, 
treatment will be assigned based on the treatment patients actuall y received, regardless of the 
treatment to which they  were randomized, unless otherwise specified. This anal ysis set will be 
used for all safet y ana lyses.
Additional analy sis sets may  be defined in the Statistical Analy sis Plan, if appropriate.

18Analysis
Primary Analysis:
The primary  endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving well- controlled asthma as defined 
by [CONTACT_16944] 20, or a clinically  important improvement in asthma 
control as defined b y an increase of at least [ADDRESS_16098] units from baseline at the end of the 24 -week 
treatment period (ie, a responder is defined b y an ACT score of greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_16099] units from baseline).
The anal ysis is set within an estimand framework that will address objectives of the study , the 
effectiveness of the DS, specificall y: is there a difference in treatment groups in the number of 
patients achieving meaningful clinical asthma control. Withdrawals due to technology  failure, 
disliking technology , or disliking I MP will be counted as nonresponders.
Estimand framework:
1. Population: The patients met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria. The mITT analysis set will be the primary anal ysis set for the primary  endpoint. 
2.Variable: The primary  endpoint will be a binary  response variable at Week 24. A patient 
will be defined as a responder if the patient achieves an ACT score of greater than or 
equal to [ADDRESS_16100] units from baseline to 
Week 24. Otherwise, the patient will be defined as a nonresponder.
3.Intercurrent events: Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event, lack of efficacy , 
technology  failure, disliking the DS, disliking IMP, or other reasons. For those who 
discontinue the treatment before Week 24, no further data will be collected.
4.Population -level summary: The primary  endpoint will be anal yzed using a logistic model, 
where binary  variable responder rate (Yes/No) will be modeled through logit link 
function, with baseline ACT score and treatment as explanatory  factors. For those who 
discontinue the treatment before Week 24 due to technology  failure, disliking the DS, or 
disliking I MP, the patients will be defined as nonresponders; for those who discontinue 
early not due to these reasons, the response at the Earl y Termination visit will be used. 
The mean and 95% credible intervals of the response rates and OR from the posterior 
distributions will be calculated and presented. An informative prior will be assumed for 
the model coefficient for treatment and non -informative priors will be assumed for all 
other model coefficients. The details for the data analy sis will be specified in the 
Statistical Analy sis Plan.
Sensitivity Analysis:
If appropriate, sensitivity anal yses will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
Secondary Analysis:
Summaries of all secondary  endpoints will be presented descriptivel y based on the mI TT 
analysis set. 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number [n], mean, standard deviation [SD], 
median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for observed v alues and changes from

19baseline to each time point. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be 
provided.
 
Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity:
No adjustments will be made for the preplanned multiple comparisons/endpoints.
Safety Analyses: Safety  anal yses will be performed on the safety  anal ysis set.
Safety  assessments and time points are pr ovided in Table 5. 
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities. Each 
patient will be counted only
 once in each preferred term or s ystem organ class category  for the 
analyses of safet y. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events (overall and by [CONTACT_11370] y), 
adverse events determined by  [CONTACT_16945] (ie, reasonable 
possibility ) (defined as related or with missing relationship) (overall and by  [CONTACT_11370] y), serious 
adverse events, adverse events causing withdrawal from the study , and adverse device effects. 
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_11364]. Patien t listings of serious 
adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented.
Changes in vital signs measurements data will be summarized descriptively. All values will be 
compared with predefined criteria to identify  potentially  clinica lly significant values or changes, 
and such values will be listed.
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by  [CONTACT_16946].
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) 
will be provided for observed values and changes from baseline to each time point. For 
categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. Descriptive summaries of 
serious adverse events, patient withdrawals due to adverse even ts, adverse device effects, and 
potentially  clinicall y significant abnormal values (vital signs) based on predefined criteria will be 
provided as well.
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the CSR.
Planned Interim Analysis: No interim anal yses are planned.

and mortality  of those affected ( Global Initiative for Asthma [GI NA] 2020 ).
Clinical data demonstrate that use of the fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16865] e/salmeterol (FS) combination in 
both adults and children with persistent asthma provides greater improvement in pulmonary  
function and overall asthma control than either individual component alone. The use of such a 
combination is recommended for the main tenance treatment of asthma in children, adolescents, 
and adults who remain s ymptomatic despi[INVESTIGATOR_16866] -to-medium doses of an inhaled corticosteroid 
(ICS) in accordance with current guidelines for the management of asthma ( National Asthma 
Education and Prevention Program [NAEPP] 2007 ).
Fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (Fp) is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent 
anti-inflammatory  activity . Inflammation is an important component of the pathophy siology  of 
asthma and corticosteroids have been shown to inhibit multiple inflammatory  cells and mediators 
involved in the pathophysiology  of asthma. Salmeterol xinafoate (Sx) is a selective, long- acting 
beta [ADDRESS_16111] (LABA). In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least [ADDRESS_16112] in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular aden yl cyclase 
that leads to increased levels of cy clic-3′, 5′-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) leading to 
relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of imme diate 
hypersensitivity  from cells, especiall y from mast cells.
Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc. (Teva) has developed a combination product 
of Fp/Sx inhalation powders, using the Teva proprietary  multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI). 
The combin ation product, fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]/salmeterol multidose dry  powder inhaler 
(FSMDPI), is supplied in multiple dosage strengths of Fp with a fixed dosage of Sx (the 
conversion factor from Sx to salmeterol free base [Sb] is 0.6883). Salmeterol xinafoate w ill 
dissolve and dissociate into Sb (active moiety ) in the lung to exert a therapeutic effect.
Teva has developed multiple dosage strengths of FS MDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16867]. The Teva device- formulation comb ination allows for the 
concentrations of the drug in the formulation to be significantl y lower than those in ADVAIR 
DISKUS®(GlaxoSmithKline) while achieving similar to lower sy stemic exposure and 
comparable clinical benefits.

 CLN0035849 2.[ADDRESS_16113] s as a fine powder without 
the use of propellants. The FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16868]- driven device and thus eliminates the need 
for coordination of actuation and inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 
On 27 January  2017, the [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
FSMDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16869]®(FS inhalation powder) for the treatment of asthma in 
patients 12 years of age or older. The approved metered dose strengths of 
AIRDUO RESPI [INVESTIGATOR_16870] 55/14 mcg, 113/14 mcg, and 232/14 m cg. 
On 12 July  2019, the US FDA approved FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16871] (eMDPI) 
as AIRDUO®DIGIHALER ™(FS) inhalation powder, for the same indication and metered dose 
strengths, supported by [CONTACT_16947] [INVESTIGATOR_16872] 
(which does not contain the electronic module [eModule]). AI RDUO DIGIHALER contains a 
built-in eModule (ie, the Digihaler) that detects, records, and stores data on inhaler events for 
transmission to a smart device application (App). More detaile d prescribing information for this 
product may  be found in the FS eMDPI [CONTACT_10670]’s Brochure (IB).
As the recommended drug for relief of acute asthmatic sy mptoms and as the prophy laxis for 
exercise -induced bronchoconstriction, short -acting beta 2agonist s (SABAs), such as albuterol, are 
a mainstay  of asthma management. Albuterol sulfate is a beta 2-adrenergic agonist with the 
chemical name α1 [(tert buty lamino) methy l]-4-hydroxy - m- xylene-α,αʹ-diol sulfate (2:1) [salt]. 
The use of inhaled aerosol medications for asthma is ideal because inhalation delivers relativel y 
low doses of the drug rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16873]. This preferred administration mode achieves 
high drug concentrations in the airway s while minimizing sy stemic side effects ( Dolovich et al 
2005). Inhaled albuterol aerosols are the most commonly  prescribed treatments for the relief of 
bronchoconstriction. 
Although albuterol has traditionally  been administered via conventional “press -and-breathe” 
metered dose inha lers (MDI s), inefficient inhaler technique (ie, inability  to properl y coordinate 
actuation with inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) is a common problem with these devices; as a consequence, delivery  
of the active drug to the airway s can be compromised, potentially  resulting in s uboptimal clinical 
benefits ( Allen et al [ADDRESS_16114] et al 2003). To 
eliminate the necessit y for coordinating actuation with inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], Teva developed the breath -
actuated inhaler PROAIR RESPI [INVESTIGATOR_16872], which utilizes a formulation blend of albuterol sulfate 
with lactose as an excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Breath actuation has been found t o reduce administration errors in 
comparison with conventional MDI s (Lenney  et al 2000
, Price et al 1999 ).
PROAI R RESPI [INVESTIGATOR_16872] (albuterol sulfate inhalation powder) has been available in the US since
March 2015. It is indicated for treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in patients [ADDRESS_16115]  disease and prevention of exercise -induced 
bronchospasm (EIB) in patients 4 years of age and older. 
On 21 Dece mber 2018, the US FDA approved Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16874]®DIGIHALER 
(albuterol sulfate inhalation powder), delivering 90 mcg of albuterol base per actuation, for the 
same indication as PROAI R RESPI [INVESTIGATOR_16872]. PROAI R DIGIHALER also contains the eModule 
(ie, the Digihaler) that detects, records, and stores data on inhaler events for transmission to a 
mobile App. More detailed prescribing information for this product may  be found in the 
Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16875].

31In this study, both FS (as maintenance medication) and albu terol sulfate (as rescue medication) 
will be delivered via an eMDPI . Teva has developed the eModule (ie, the Digihaler) as part of a 
Digital Sy stem (DS) to assist a patient with asthma to appropriately  use the eMDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16876]. The 
system is described in more practical terms as an inhaler with integrated data logger capable of 
storing and transmitting timestamped data. The information from the eModule will be 
transmitted wirelessly  (Bluetooth L ow Energy ) to the smart device App. From the App, data may  
be trans mitted to a common Digital Health Platform (DHP; Cloud solution) and then to a 
common provider -facing dashboard. The DHP is used to provide patient- specific data to the 
patient’s healthcare provider (HCP) via the dashboard, a secure web interface. The foll owing 
devices will be evaluated in this study :
FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16848] 4 component devices:
Device 1: FS eMDPI
Device 2: Patient-facing smart device App (same for both investigational 
medicinal products [I MPs])
Device 3: DHP (Cloud solution, same for both IMPs)
Device 4: Provider -facing dashboard (same for both I MPs)
Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16848] 4 component devices:

Device 2: Patient- facing smart device App (same for both IMPs)
Device 3: DHP (Cloud solution, same for both IMPs)
Device 4: Provi der-facing dashboard (same for both I MPs)
The purpose of the study  is to evaluate whether outcomes for patients using the FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16877] a Standard of Care (SoC) group who will be 
treated with their current tre atment provided b y the investigational center, based on asthma 
guidelines, and will not use the DS during the treatment period. The stud y will also assess mean 
weekl y SABA usage and the number of SABA -free day s, adherence patterns to maintenance 
treatment 
(FS eMDPI) in the DS group, the asthma management actions of investigational heath 
care providers (iHCPs) using the dashboard as part of the DS, and will collect information using 
patient questionnaires that focus on patients’ beliefs and perceptions about their disease and 
inhaler satisfaction, as well as patient and investigational center personnel questionnaires on 
system usability .
1.2. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
1.2.1. Studies with FS MDPI/FS eMDPI
A global clinical development program was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy  of FS 
MDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16878] (12 years of age and older) with asthma. This clinical 
development program comprised 9 studies. Seven of the 9 studies included patients 12 years of 
age or older with persistent asthma. The other 2 studies (both Phase 1 pharmacokinetics studies) 
 Version

32included health y adult subjects. This global clinical development program also supported the 
approval of FS eMDPI.
Overall, the data g enerated during the clinical development program supports the use of FS 
MDPI /FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16879] 12 years and older. 
Efficacy  results of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies indicated that all 3 dose strengths of FS MDPI 
(metered doses 55/14, 113/14, and 232/14 mcg twice dail y) significantl y improve lung function, 
reduce rescue bronchodilator use, and improve asthma sy mptoms and quality  of life in patients 
with asthma 12 years of age and older. 
FS MDPI /FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16880] a favorable safety profile in the maintenance treatment of 
asthma as proph ylactic therap y in patients 12 years of age and older.
Teva has also conducted a pediatric clinical development program for these products. This 
program consisted of a pharmacokinetics stud y (FSS -PK-[ZIP_CODE]) followed by  a Phase 3 study  
(FSS -AS-[ZIP_CODE]) of the safet y and efficacy of Fp MDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16881] 4 to 
11years of age over a 12 -week treatment period. Likewise, the Phase 3 pediatric efficacy stud y 
showed that treatment with Fp MDPI  25 and 50 mcg was associated with greater improvements 
in lung function (compared to placebo treatment) in children ages 4 through 11 y ears with 
persistent asthma.
More detailed information is provided in the FS eMDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16875].
1.2.2. Studies with Albuterol MDPI/eMDPI
A comprehensive clinical development program was conducted in the US to evaluate the safet y 
and efficacy  of Albuterol MDPI /eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16878] (12 years of age and 
older) with asthma and EIB. It was comprised of one Phase 1 study  in adults 18 through 45 
years, one Phase 2 study  in patients 12 y ears of age or older, and 5 Phase 3 studies in patients 12 
years of age or older. A separate clinical development program was conducted in pediatric 
patients (4 through 11 years of age) to examine efficacy  and safety  of Albuterol MDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16882]. 
Overall, this clinical development program confirmed that Albuterol MDPI/eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16883] -tolerated therap y for the treatment and prevention of bronchospas m in patients 
4years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway  disease. Results showed that 
Albuterol MDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16884] a comparable pharmacod ynamic and efficacy  profile to PROAI RHFA . 
Results also supported the effectiveness of Albuterol MDPI /eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] t he prevention of EIB. In 
addition, the comparable exposure of Albuterol MDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16885] y profile as being consistent with that of PROAI RHFA, which has 
extensive postmarketing experience.

2.1. Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints
The primary  and seconda ry study  objectives and endpoints are:
Objectives Endpoints
The primary objective of 
this study  is to demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the DS 
compared to the SoC group. The primary  endpoint is the proportion of patients for the DS and 
SoC groups achieving well -controlled asthma as defined b y an 
Asthma Control Test (ACT) score of greater than or equal to 20, 
or a clinicall y important improvement in asthma control as 
defined b y an increase of at least [ADDRESS_16116] units from baseline at 
the end of the 24- week treatment period.
The secondary objective 
(#1) is to describe the asthma 
management actions by  
[CONTACT_16949].This secondary  endpoint is the frequency  and t ypes of 
interventions done to improve asthma control including:
number of discussions regarding inhaler technique or 
adherence
number of adjustments of therap y including:
increased or decreased doses of inhaled 
medication
change to different inhaled medication
additional inhaled medication
addition of a sy stemic corticosteroid medication 
for asthma or another controller, including a long -
acting muscarinic antagonist (L AMA) or 
biologics
frequency  of intervention to manage comorbid 
conditions associated with poor asthma control 
(gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], si nusitis, 
etc.)
The secondary objective 
(#2) is to evaluate SABA 
usage and the number of 
SABA- free day s in the DS 
group.This secondary  endpoint is the change from baseline in the mean 
weekl y SABA usage and the change from baseline in the number 
of SABA -free day s over the 24 -week treatment period for the 
DS group.

35Objectives Endpoints
The secondary objective 
(#3) is to evaluate adherence 
patterns to maintenance 
treatment (FS eMDPI) in the 
DS group.This secondary  endpoint is the change from baseline in 
adherence to maintenance treatment (FS eMDPI), defined as the 
proportion of actual inhalation doses taken out of the total 
number of inhalation doses prescribed over the 24- week 
treatment period.
The secondary objective 
(#4) is to assess behavioral 
correlates of responsiveness 
to digital health technology  
among patients for all 
patients in both groups.This secondary  endpoint is the assessment of patients’ beliefs 
and perceptions about their disease an d treatment, utilizing the 
BMQ and the BIPQ to both the DS and SoC groups, patients 18 
years of age or older, describing their behavioral profile at 
baseline and at the end of the study .
The secondary objective 
(#5) is to evaluate work 
productivity  and ac tivity  
impairment in asthma 
patients in both groups.This secondary  endpoint is the change from baseline measured 
by [CONTACT_16950], completed by  [CONTACT_1962] 18 y ears of 
age or older in both groups, at baseline and at the end of the 24-
week treatment period.
The secondary objective 
(#6) is to assess the usability  
and acceptability  of the DS 
by [CONTACT_16937].This secondary  endpoint is the assessment of the DS (eMDPI, 
App, and dashboard) acceptability and usabilit y, utilizing the 
SUS, completed by  [CONTACT_16938], 18 y ears of age 
or older, and the investigational center personnel at the end of 
the study .
The secondary objective 
(#7) is to evaluate the safety  
of FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16891] I.This secondary  endpoint is the reporting of adverse events 
related to FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16851].
The safet y endpoints for this study  include the following for all 
patients in both groups:
adverse event data
adverse device effect data
Notes: The Digital System (DS) group will include eligible study population patients who will use the DS 
(FSeMDPI, Albuterol eMDPI, and common App, DHP [cloud solution], and dashboard) during the treatment 
period. The Standard of Care (SoC) group will include eligible patients who will be treated with their current 
treatment provided by [CONTACT_16939], based on asthma guidelines.
2.1.1. Justification of Primary Endpoint
Current asthma guidelines emphasize that asthma sy mptom control is a key therapeutic goal and 
recommend assessments of asthma control as a guide to step therap y. The ACT has been 
recommended b y the National I nstitutes of Health as a useful objective scoring s ystem to 
measure asthma sy mptom contro l as a measure of core outcomes for both clinical trials and 
observational studies ( Cloutier et al 2012 ). ACT scores indicating poorer sy mptom control have 
been associated with higher risk of asthma exacerbations as well as asthma related health care

36resource utilization ( Ko et al 2012 ). In general, an ACT score of greater than 20 indicates well -
controlled asthma ( Nathan et al 2004) and the minimally  important difference that represents a 
clinically  significant change in ACT has been demonstrated to be 3 units ( Schatz et al 2009).

373. STUDY  DESIGN
3.1. General Study Design and Study Schematic Diagram
This is a 24- week treatment, multicenter, open -label, randomized, parallel group comparison 
feasibility  study  of SoC treatment versus using the eMDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16852], including inhaler, App, DHP 
(Cloud solution), and dashboard, to optimize outcomes in patients at least [ADDRESS_16117] of a screening/baseline visit (Visit 1), a 24- week, open -label treatment 
period with Visit 2 (either in -person or remote) at Week 12 a nd Visit 3 at Week 24, and a follow -
up telephone call (2 weeks following treatment completion). 
Patients with suboptimal asthma control will be enrolled in the study  and randomized, in a 4:3 
ratio, respectively , to 1 of 2 parallel groups ( Table 4), stratified b y investigational center.

The DS group patients will use the FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16853] a common App, 
DHP (Cloud solution), and dashboard. The SoC group patients, who will include eligible patients 
treated with their current treatment provided b y the investigational center to the patient, based on 
asthma guidelines, will not use the DS during the treatment period. Similar data will be collected 
regarding outcomes for both groups: ACT after [ADDRESS_16119] a screening/baseline visit (Visit 1), at which they  will be asked if they  own 
a smart device and use different applications on their smartphones. A baseline ACT score f or all 
patients, and BMQ, BIPQ, Mini- AQLQ, and WPAI questionnaire responses for patients 18 years 
of age or older will be collected. At Visit 1, patients in the DS group will be trained on the use of 
the eMDPI (including instructions on how to use both the eMDPI s and the App). Upon 
demonstrating competency , patients in the DS group will have their maintenance ICS with 
LABA switched to the FS eMDPI  (at a dose of fluticasone comparable to their most recent 
current ICS dose) and their rescue treatment switched to the Albuterol eMDPI . All other asthma 
maintenance medications, except for ICS with L ABA, may  be continued. The iHCP can add

38another controller medication other than an ICS with L ABA, including a biologic, to the DS 
patient’s treatment, if needed. Patie nts in the SoC group will be reimbursed or given a voucher to 
use to purchase their existing maintenance ICS with L ABA and rescue medications. P atients in 
the DS group will receive a new FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16854] [ADDRESS_16120]- to-patien t (DTP) shipments, after Visit 1, the investigational 
center will receive periodic email reminders to access the interactive response technology (IRT) 
system to confirm the dose of test IMP to be shipped to the patient. Confirmation of the dose is 
required before the next shipment can be sent. 
Investigational centers will receive similar instruction regarding features of the App, as well as 
features of the associated common dashboard, which mirrors the digital information obtained 
from the eMDPIs and App, including frequency  and times of SABA rescue use and associated 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_16892].
The SoC group will be followed according to the clinical judgment of the investigator; the 
asthma of patients in the SoC group will be managed in a manner consistent with the clinical 
judgement of the investigator and based on asthma management guidelines (eg, GINA). Similar 
to the management of the SoC group, the DS group patients will be followed by  [CONTACT_16951]  [INVESTIGATOR_16893], respectively . The iHCPs will check the dashboard at least once a week and use 
this information, along with any  other additional information about the patient, as per their 
clinical judgement, to modify  patients’ asthma management. The investigator may , if indicated, 
modify  the patient’s regime, including adding asthma controllers or biologics as otherwise 
clinically  indicated in the judgement of the investigator. Clinicall y Driven Assessments for both 
groups, if necessary , should be arranged, per the clinical judgement of the iHCP managing the 
patient, and can be via a telephone call or an on -site visit.
For all patients, at Visit 2, Visit 3, and any Clinically  Driven Assessments, if necessary , the 
iHCP will record answers to Asthma Management questions, including discussions regarding 
adherence, or inhaler technique, t
reatment adjustments, or additions of new treatments, including 
biologic medication usage. Additionally , in the case of a Clinically  Driven Assessment (for 
patients in the DS group), the iHCP will be asked whether or not the contact [CONTACT_16952]. 
Visit 2 (if it is an in- person visit) will include dispensing of new inhalers to the DS group 
patients and return of used or unused inhalers that were dispensed to the patients previously . 
New FS eMDP I devices will continue to be shipped directl y to patients periodically after Visit [ADDRESS_16121] will be completed and scores registered.
At the end of the treatment period (24 weeks), final assessments of the DS and SoC groups wil l 
be completed, as specified in Table 5, and the rest of the inhalers that were dispensed to the DS 
group patients will be returned
. A follow -up teleph one call will be made by [CONTACT_16953]0035849 2.[ADDRESS_16122] returned to 
their previous asthma treatments.
It should also be noted that no specific clinical decisions are being mandate d. One secondary  
objective of this study  is to describe how clinicians actually use the information provided by  [CONTACT_16943].

A total of 38 8 patients will be enrolled in the study (accounting for 10% early dropouts) and the 
total number of evaluable patients is planned to be 350 (200 patients in the DS group and 
150 patients in the SoC group). Details on definition of evaluable patients and s ample size are 
given in Section 9.1.
The study  is planned to be conducted in the US in approximately  [ADDRESS_16123] of the study , 
serious adverse events will be reviewed (
Section 7.1.5) as they  are reported from the 
investigational centers to identify  safet y concerns.
The study  may be terminated by  [CONTACT_11331]. For example, the 
sponsor should terminate the study  in the event of the following:
new toxicological or pharmacological findings or safet y issues invalidate the earlier 
positive benefit -risk assessm ent
discontinuation of the development of the IMP or device
If the whole stud y is stopped, patients who are terminated earl y will be followed according to 
Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient 
(Section 4.3).

patient w ill pair the new device with the App. The patient will immediately stop using the old device and switch to the new 
device. If Visit 2 is in -person at the investigational center, a new FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16896].
gPatients will receive an Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16897], along with training on use and proper technique, at Visit 1 [Day 1] and 
Visit 2 [Week 12]). Extra Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16898], based on the clinic al judgment of the 
investigator. Upon receipt, the patient will pair the new device with the App. The patient will immediately stop using the ol d 
device and switch to the new device.
hTo trigger DTP shipments, after Visit 1, the investigational center will receive periodic email reminders to access the IRT 
system to confirm the dose of test IMP to be shipped to the patient. Confirmation must occur within ±2days of the email date 
and is required before the next shipment can be sent. The investigational center will be asked to confirm the dose of FS eMDP I 
and to specify whether an Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16899] (if not already schedu led). The 3 -day visit 
windows do not apply to dose confirmation. Email reminders will be triggered based on the date of the previous visit or DTP 
shipment. If there is a need to send an additional DTP shipment outside of the regularly scheduled shipments ( eg, for an 
additional or replacement device), it will be done in addition to the scheduled shipments.
iDose confirmation at a Clinically Driven Assessment visit should be performed only if the p atient’s dose is being changed at 
this visit.

90 day s. (However, dur ing the study , patients can be escalated to therap y with such 
agents if clinicall y indicated in the judgement of the investigator as part of their 
asthma management and remain in the study .)
i.The patient has a known hy persensitivity  to an y components of the IMPs stated in this 
protocol.
4.3. Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient
Each patient is free to withdraw from the stud y or discontinue from IMP or using the devices at 
any time, without prejudice to their continued care. Patient must be withdrawn from the stud y if 
any of the following events occur:
1. Patient withdraws consent or requests discontinuation from the IMP or withdrawal from 
the study  for any  reason.
2. Patient develops an illness that would interfere with his/her continued participation.
3. Pat ient is noncompliant with the study  procedures and assessments or administration of 
FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16901] , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].
4. Patient takes prohibited concomitant medications as defined in this protocol (ie, other 
SABA products). 
5.The sponsor requests withdrawal of the patient.
6. Patient experiences an adverse event or other medical condition which indicates to the 
investigator that continued participation is not in the best interest of the patient.
Patients should be treated with SoC a fter withdrawal from or termination of the study  as 
appropriate.
Investigators should attempt to obtain information on patients in the case of withdrawal from the 
study  or discontinuation from IMP. Results of any evaluations and observations, together with a 
narrative describing the reason(s) for withdrawal from the study  or discontinuation from IMP, 
must be recorded in the source documents. The case report form (CRF) must document the 
primary  reason for withdrawal from the study  or discontinuation from I MP.
See Appendix Efor information regarding how the study  will define and address patients who 
are lost to follow -up to help limit the amount and imp act of missing data.
 Version    
 CLN0035849 2.0 Approved Page 45 of 98
Parallel -group, Controlled Study  -Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study  FSS -AS-[ZIP_CODE]
46If the reason for withdrawal from the stud y or discontinuation from IMP is an adverse event 
and/or adverse device effect, monitoring will be continued as applicable (eg, until the event has 
resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a healthcare professional, or until 
a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study  procedure is made). The specific event 
or test result (including repeated test results, as applicable) must be recorded both on the source 
documentation and in the CRF; both the adverse events page and/or adverse device effect page 
and the termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time .The investigator must inform 
the contract research organization (CRO) as soon as possible of ea ch patient who is being 
considered for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additional reports must be provided when 
requested.
If a patient is withdrawn from the study  or discontinues I MP for multiple reasons that include 
adverse events, the relevant page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to 
an adverse event. An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event 
that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_16902] a prohibited medication, thereby [CONTACT_16957]. In 
such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be “need to take a prohibited medication,” not 
the adverse event.
In the case of patients lost to follow -up, attempts to contact [CONTACT_11333]’s medical records and transcribed to the CRF.
All assessments should be performed according to the protocol for the end of treatment visit or 
upon earl y termination if possible. Patient s are required to return the FS eMDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16850]  (used and unused) upon withdrawal from the study .
4.4. Replacement of Patients
A patient who is enrolled but does not complete the treatment period will not be replaced.
4.5. Rescreening
A patient who is scre ened but not enrolled within 7 days of screening, because he/she did not 
satisfy  inclusion/exclusion criteria or enrollment did not occur within the specified time, may  be 
considered for rescreening once if, for example, there is a change in the patient’s medical 
background or a modification of study  inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Patients may  have individual parameters retested at the discretion of both the investigator and the 
sponsor .
If the patient is rescreened, the informed consent form (I CF) will need to be resigned.
4.6. Screening Failure
Screening failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study  but 
are not subsequently  enrolled in the study . Minimal information includes, but is not limited to, 
demograph y, screenin g failure details, eligibility  criteria, and any  serious adverse events.

At Visit 1, patients in the DS group will be trained on the use of the eMDPI (including 
instructions on how to use both the eMDPIs and the App). Upon demonstrating competency , 
patients in the DS group will have their maintenance ICS with LABA switched to the FS eMDPI 
(at a dose of fluticasone comparable to their most recent current I CS dose) and their rescue 
treatment switched to the Albuterol eMDPI . All other asthma maintenance medications, except 
for ICS with L ABA, may be continued. The iHCP can add another controller medication other 
than an ICS with L ABA, including a biologic, to the DS patient’s treatment, if need ed. Patients 
in the SoC group will be reimbursed or given a voucher to use to purchase their existing 
maintenance ICS with LABA and rescue medications. Patients in the DS group will receive a 
new FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16903] [ADDRESS_16129] IMP to be shipped to the patient. Confirmation 
of the dose is required before the next shipment can be sent. 
Patients will be instructed to return all inhalers to the investigational center at Visit 2 and at the 
end of treatment visit or Earl y Termination (ET) visit.

The FS eMDPI (marketed as AIRDUO DIGIHALER) is formulated in lact ose and delivers drug 
to the airway s as a fine powder without the use of propellants. The inhaler is a multidose, 
inhalation -
driven, dry powder inhaler for oral inhalation that meters 55 mcg, 113 mcg, or 232 mcg of 
fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16904] 14 mcg of salmeterol from the device reservoir and delivers 49 mcg, 
100 mcg, or 202 mcg of fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16904] 12.75 mcg of salmeterol, respectively, from the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_16905]. The inhaler contains 60 actuations; the inhaler is equipped with a dose 
counter that shows onl y even numbers and counts down to “0.”
The FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16906] (eModule) that store and transmit information related 
to inhaler use via Bluetooth to the DIGIHALER App installed on a smart device. The eModule 
does not cont rol or interfere with how patients use the inhaler to take their inhalations. The 
inhaler can be used with or without the App. 
The sy stem stores and transmits information about inhaler use and helps a patient use their 
inhaler correctl y. In regular use, patients are expected to open the y ellow cap, inhale through the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], and close the cap to receive an inhalation.
Albuterol MDPI  (marketed in the US as PROAI R DIGIHALER ) is an inhalation- driven eMDPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_16907] a blend of albuterol sulfate and alpha -lactose monohy drate. The inhaler contains 
200actuations, each delivering 90 mcg of albuterol base ex- mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]; the inhaler is equipped 
with a dose counter that shows only  even numbers and counts down to “0.”
The plastic inhaler comprises a reservoir con taining inhalation powder, a metering s ystem, a 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_16908], and an eModule sitting on top of the drug -delivery  compartment. 
Teva has developed the eModule as part of a s ystem to assist a patient with asthma to 
appropriatel y use the eMDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_16876]. The s ystem is described in more practical terms as an 
inhaler with an integrated data logger capable of storing and transmitting timestamped data to 
support the data logging functionality . As with the FS eMDPI, the eModule stores and transmits 
infor mation related to inhaler use via Bluetooth to the DIGIHALER App installed on a smart 
device; the same DIGIHAL ER App is used for both the FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16909].
The on- board electronics and power sources are fully  integrated into the eMDPI s and are 
designed to operate for the life of the inhalers without intervention, ie, the batteries do not 
require replacement or recharging. 
The addition of the required electronics has no impact on the pharmaceutical performance of the 
inhalers or on the required user steps to take a dose. A schematic of the inhaler with the 
additional eModule is shown in Figure 3.

Additional details may be found in Table 6and in the IBs.
The information from the eModule may  be transmitted wirelessly  (Bluetooth L ow Energy ) to an 
App. From the App, data may  be transmitted to the DHP, which consists of a Cloud solution, and 
then to a dashboard. This allows the p atient and/or the caregiver to track when and how well the 
inhaler was used.
By [CONTACT_16958] , the patient must also download the smart device App (with 
the assistance of investigational center personnel), accept the smart device App’s Privacy  Notice 
and Terms of Use, and also agree to share his/her data to a provider -facing dashboard utilized by  
[CONTACT_16959] y team. An ICF will be provided to the patients which 
will elaborate, among other way s, Teva’s way s ofuse and storing of patient data collected 
through the smart device App. The patient will be entering into a direct contractual relationship 
with Teva which will govern, among other things, Teva’s rights to use and store patient data 
collected through the smart device App. If the patient does not accept the smart device App’s 
Privacy  Notice and Terms of Use and does not also agree to share their data to the provider -
facing dashboard utilized by  [CONTACT_16960], then the patient 
cannot enroll in the stud y. At the end of treatment/ET visit (Visit 3), investigational center 
personnel will remove the App from the patient’s smart device.

5.1.2. Medical Devices
Instructions for medical device use are provided in the Study  Pharmacy  Manual .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Application
The software App is a customer -facing software/focused smart device application for patients 
using the FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16910]. The intention of the App is to engage patients with asthma and their caregivers b y 
tracking medication usage, raising awareness of medication use patterns, allowing users to self -
assess their respi[INVESTIGATOR_16911] a dail y basis, shari ng information on local environmental 
conditions, and producing user reports to review their data over time.
The software consists of a smart device App compatible with iPhone operating s ystems (iOS) 
and Android operating s ystems that will store data local ly on the patient’s smart device and in 
the cloud (DHP) when the user is online. The App will receive a patient’s inhaler use/event data 
automatically  via Bluetooth on a smart device. The smart device camera will be used for 
scanning and pairing. This data will allow the patient to track their usage of medication, 
inhalation results, and self -assessments related to their asthma. The App gets environment 
information for the specific location of the patient.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Teva Digital Health Platform (Cloud Solution)
The Teva DHP is a sy stem that stores and transfers inhaler use/event data collected from the 
App. The Cloud solution automatically  synchronizes with the App after events and/or at 
predetermined time periods/intervals. An internet connection to the smart device (eg, wireless or 
cellular phone network) is required in order for communication to be established between the 
App and the Cloud solution. The Cloud solution does not create, modify , or delete patient 
information.
Patient privacy  will be maintained according to the laws and regulations, and patient identifiers 
will be substituted to maintain a patient’s privacy  to reviewers of the data. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dashboard
The DHP may  be used to provide patient-specific data to the iHCP via the dashboard, a secure 
web interface. The data available on the dashboard are the inhaler use data and patient self -
assessments from the App. The patient has no interaction with the dashboard. Teva personnel 
will have no access to the dashboard.

Supplies of I MPs will be labeled according to the current Intern ational Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing 
Practice and will include any  locall y required statements. 
5.2.3. Accountability
Each IMP shipment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the s hipment, return 
instructions, and any  applicable forms.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMPs for initial distribution to 
patients and other stud y materials from the sponsor are correctl y received, recorded, handled, and 
safel y and properl y stored in accordance with national and local regulations, and used in 
accordance with this protocol.
Only  patients enrolled in the study  may  receive IMPs, and only  authorized personnel at the 
investigational center may suppl y or adminis ter IMPs. All I MPs must be stored in a secure, 
environmentally  controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the 
labeled storage conditions or appropriate instructions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized personn el at the investigational center. The investigator (or designee) will instruct the 
patient to store the IMPs according to the instructions on the labels, if applicable; or will give 
instructions in an appropriate form. 
Patients will be instructed to return all IMPs (empty , partiall y 
used, and unused inhalers) to the investigational center at Visit 2 and the end of treatment/ET 
visit.
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for IMP accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, 
reconciliation, and final disposition records). Patients will return all inhalers at the end of the 
study  to the investigational center for reconciliation.
A record of IMP accountability  (ie, IMP and other study  materials received, used, retained, and 
returned) must be prepared and signed b y the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461], with an account 
given for an y discrepancies. Empty , partially  used, and unused inhalers will be collected at t he

Concomitant medication and treatment will be recorded through the final visit.
5.7. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance
The investigator will be responsible for dispensing I MPs, training patients on the correct use of 
IMPs, return of IMPs, and I MP accountability  records will be completed.
If the investigator or the sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study  
protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient shoul d be 
withdrawn from the study.
Exposure to I MP will be assessed as required. Since the Albuterol eMDPI (IMP) is a rescue 
medication, it will be used on an “as needed” basis.
5.8. Randomization and Blinding
This is an open- label study  and patients will be random ly assigned to the DS group or SoC group 
in a 4:[ADDRESS_16135] is scored on a 
5-point scale, with summation of all items providing scores ranging from 5 to 25. The scores 
span the continuum of poor control of asthma (score of 5) to complete control of asthma (score 
of 25), with a cutoff score of 19 and below indicating patients with poorl y controlled asthma 
(Schatz et

6.1.2. Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire
The Mini -AQLQ is a reduced version of the Asthma Quality  of Life Questionnair e (AQ LQ). It 
was developed with patient inpu t and is psy chometrically  validated ( Juniper et al 1999). It 
accesses [ADDRESS_16137].
6.1.3. Work Productivity and Ac tivity Impairment Questionnaire
The WPAI  questionnaire is used to measure work productivity  and activity  impairment ( Reilly  et

asthma in the past 7 day s), presenteeism (percentage of impairment while at work due to asthma 
 Version    
 CLN0035849 2.[ADDRESS_16138] 7 day s), overall work impairment (aggregate of absenteeism and presenteeism), and 
activity  impairment (percentage of impairment in daily  activities due to asthma in the past 
7days). The WPAI questionnaire will be answered by  [CONTACT_1962], 18 y ears of age or older, at the 
investigational center at Visit 1, Visit 3, or at the ET visit. The WPAI  questionnaire should be the 
3rdquestionnaire completed during a stud y visit following the Mini -AQLQ.
6.1.4. Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire
The BMQ is used to assess cognitive representations of medicine ( Horne, Weinman, and 
Hankins 1999). The BMQ -Specific (BMQ -S11) is an 11-item questionnaire that assesses 
representation of medication prescribed for personal use and the BMQ -General assesses beliefs 
about medicines in general. For the purposes of this st udy, the BMQ -
S11 will be completed b y 
patients 18 y ears of age or older at the investigational center at Visit 1, Visit 3, or at the ET visit.

577. ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY
In this stud y, safety will be assessed b y qualified study  personnel by  [CONTACT_16967], adverse device effects, vital signs measurements, and use of concomitant medication s.
Adverse events are categorized by  [CONTACT_16968], and adverse device effects are categorized 
and classified according to I nternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011(E).
Device deficiencies that are not associated with an adverse event as well as those that have the 
potential to cause a serious adverse event are covered in Appendix F.
7.1. Adverse Events
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury , or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory  findings) in patients or clinical investigation 
subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related (causal relationship) to 
thepharmaceutical product (treatment), investigational medical device, or comparator. This 
definition includes events related to the procedures involved. For users or other persons, this 
definition is restricted to events related to investigational medical devices. 
An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorable and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or 
laboratory  parameter that develops or worsens in severit y during the course of thisstudy , or 
significant worsening of the disease under study  or of any  concurrent disease. A new condition 
or the worsening of a pre-existing condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable c hronic 
conditions (such as arthritis) that are present before study  entry  and do not worsen during this
study  will not be considered adverse events.
Accordingl y, an adverse event can include an y of the following:
intercurrent illnesses
physical injuries
events possibly  related to concomitant medication
significant worsening (change in nature, severit y, or frequency) of the disease under 
study  or other pre- existing conditions
drug/drug, drug/device, or device/device interactions
events occurring during diagnostic procedures of thisstudy
Worsening of asthma that occurs during the stud y that is not ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_16914]’s daily  
symptoms or leads to the patient’s discontinuation will be considered an adverse event. 
A CAE will be d efined by  1 of the following: 1) in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16915], 
2)emergency  treatment because of asthma, 3) a worsening of asthma s ymptoms leading to the 
use of prednisone or s ystemic corticosteroids for 3 day s or more, or 4) a reduction in forced

58expi[INVESTIGATOR_4034] 1 second (FEV 1)of 20% or greater. Patients will be instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_16969] a CAE.
All CAE events require documentation by  [CONTACT_16970], as well 
as in the adverse event CRF. All evaluations entered into the CAE Page require the 
investigational center to obtain source documentation of all CAEs that occur during the treatment 
period to confirm the accuracy of the information obtained from the patient. A ny CAE that meets 
serious adverse event criteria will be reported as a serious adverse event (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
7.1.2.
Recording and Reporting of Adverse Eve nts
For recording of an adverse event, the stud y period is defined for each patient as the time period 
from signature [CONTACT_17007] -up period (end of study  [follow -up telephone 
call]). The period for reporting treatment -emergent adver se events is defined as the period after 
the first dose of IMP is administered and until the end of the follow -up period. 
All adverse events that occur during the defined study period must be recorded both on the 
source documentation and the CRF, regardless of the severit y of the event or judged relationship 
to the I MP. For serious adverse events, the serious adverse event form must be completed, and 
the serious adverse event must be reported immediately  (Section [IP_ADDRESS].1). The investigator 
does not need to activel y monitor patients for adverse events after the defined period.
At each contact [CONTACT_10970], the investigator or designee must questi on the patient about 
adverse events b y asking an open
-ended question such as “Have y ou had any  unusual sy mptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs 
and sy mptoms will be recorded individually , except when considered manifestations of a 
medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. 
When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and an y test findings will be 
recorded collectively  as a singl e diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the 
serious adverse event form.
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved, 
stabilized, or returned to baseline; or until the patient is referred for continued care to a 
healthcare professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or stud y 
procedure is made.
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action 
taken regardi ng IMP, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF.
The relationship of each adverse event to IMP and study  procedures, and the severit y and 
seriousness of each adverse event, as judged b y the investigator, must be recorded as described 
below.
Further details are given in the Safety  Monitoring Plan.
 Version    
 CLN0035849 2.[ADDRESS_16141] be recorded as 1 of the following:
Mild: No limitation of usual activities
Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities
Severe: Inability  to carry  out usual activities
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Investigational Medicinal Product
The relationship of an adverse event to the IMP is characterized as follows ( Table 7):
Table 7: The Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Investigational Medicinal 
Product
Term Definition Clarification
No reasonable 
possibility
(not related)This category applies to adverse 
events that, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse 
events that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are 
evaluated, are judged to be unrelated 
to the IMP.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to 
extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:
It do es not follow  a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the administration of the IMP.
It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient.
It does not follow  a known pattern of response to the 
IMP.
It does not reappear or w orsen when the IMP is 
re-administered.
Reasonable 
possibility
(related)This category applies to adverse 
events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection with 
the administration of IMP cannot be 
ruled out with certainty.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following 
apply:
It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administra tion of the IMP.
It cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11347]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.
It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does not disappear after 
discontinuation of the IMP, yet an IMP relationship 
clearly exists.
It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP.
IMP=investigational medicinal product.

60occurring in a patient after the end of the follow -up period should be reported to the sponsor if 
the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definiti on of a Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any  of the 
following outcomes or actions:
results in death
is a life
-threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event); it does not refer to an event which h ypothetically  might have caused death 
if it were more severe
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], which 
means that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11294], or that they occurred as a consequence of the event
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11295], unless there was worsening of the pre -existing condition 
during the patient’s participation in this study .
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (refers to a substantial 
disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions)
is a congenital anomal y/birth def ect
an important medical event that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient and may  require medical intervention 
to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. Note: Any  
suspected transmission of an infectiou s agent via a medicinal product is considered an 
important medical event.
All occurrences of possible drug -induced liver injury  that meet Hy ’s law criteria, defined as all
of the below, must be reported by [CONTACT_16971] a serious adverse event:
alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase increase of >3x the upper limit 
of normal (ULN)
total bilirubin increase of >2x ULN
absence of initial fin
dings of cholestasis (ie, no substantial increase of alkaline 
phosphatase)
An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Expectedness
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant 
reference safet y information (RSI ) by [CONTACT_16972], severit y, outcome, or frequency is 
considered an unexpected adverse event. The RSI for this study  is the IB.
The sponsor’s Global Patient Safet y and Pharmacovigilance (GPSP) will determine the 
expectedness for all serious adverse events.
For the purpose of suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting, the 
version of the IB at the time of occurrence of the S[LOCATION_003]R applies.

637.1.7. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency , deviations from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case -by-case basis. To ensure patient safety , after the event has stabilized or 
treatmen
t has been administered (or both), the investigator or other ph ysician in attendance must 
contact [CONTACT_16974]. The investigator, in consultation wit h 
the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study .
7.2. Adverse Device Effects
An adverse device effect is an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical 
device or a combination product. This includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deplo yment, implantation, installation, operation, or an y 
malfunction of the investigational medical device, including an y event resulting from user error 
or from intentional mi suse of the investigational medical device.
7.2.1. Adverse Device Effect Reporting
Adverse device effects ( Figure 4) must be recorded on both the source documentation and the 
CRF. 
All adverse device effects shall be reviewed b y the investigator, the medical monitor, and the 
sponsor. The investigator and sponsor will record all relevant information regarding every  
adve rse device effect/serious adverse device effect and device deficiency  and will categorize 
each as guided in Section 7.2. 
The investigator should mak e an initial determination whether the adverse event may  be related 
to a device deficiency . 
Adverse device effects and device deficiencies will be listed in the clinical study  report (CSR).
7.2.2.
Serious Adverse Device Effects
A serious adverse device effect is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any  of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
An unanticipated s
erious adverse device effect is a serious adverse device effect that, b y its 
nature, incidence, severity , or outcome, has not been listed in Appendix F(Appendix Table 1 and 
Appendix Table 2 ).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Device Effect Reporting
The investigator will report to the sponsor, without unjustified delay , all serious adverse device 
effects (within 24hours); this information shall be promptly  followed b y detailed written reports 
as described below.

7.3. Pregnancy
All pregnancies of women participating in the study, th at occur during the study, or within at 
least [ADDRESS_16143] provide the sponsor (LSO/CRO) with the 
completed pregnancy  form. The process for reporting a pregnancy  is the same as that for 
reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy  form (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
The investigator is not required to report patients who are found to be pregnant between 
screening and baseline, provided no protocol
-related procedures were applied.
All female patients participating in the study  who become pregnant will be monitored for the 
outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous, elective, or voluntary  abortion). If the 
pregnancy  continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including 
details of birth and presence or absence of an y birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal 
and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. Any  complication of pregnancy  
during the stud y and an y complication of pregna ncy that the investigator becomes aware of after 
withdrawal from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as 
appropriate.

65Since there is no evidence of teratogenicity , genotoxicity , fetotoxicity , or spermatotoxicity  for 
thisIMP, female partners will not be required to sign an ICF to monitor the outcome of the 
pregnancy .
If the pregnancy  in the woman participating in the study  does not continue to term, 1 of the 
following actions will be taken:
For a spontaneous abortion, rep ort as a serious adverse event.
For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.
For an elective abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy 
form; do not report as an adverse event.
7.4. Medication Error and Special Situations Related to the 
Investigational Medicinal Product
Any administration of IMP that is not in accordance with the study  protocol should be reported 
in the patient’s source documents ( Appendix C), regardless of whether or not an adverse event 
occurs as a result.
The following are t ypes of medication errors and special situations:
1.Medication error: An y unintentional er ror in the prescribing, dispensing, or 
administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, 
patient, or consumer.
2.Overdose: Administration of a quantity  of a medicinal product given per administration 
or cumulatively  which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the 
authorized product information. Clinical judgment should alway s be applied. Any  dose of 
IMP (whether the test IMP or reference IMP), whether taken intentionall y or 
unintentionally , in excess of th at prescribed, must be immediately  reported to the 
sponsor.
3.Misuse: Situations where the I MP is intentionally  and inappropriately  used not in 
accordance with the authorized product information.
4.Abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of IM P which is accompanied by  
[CONTACT_11359].
5.Occupational exposure: Exposure to an I MP as a result of one’s professional or 
nonprofessional occupation.
6. Breastfeeding: Suspected adverse reactions which occur in infants following expo sure to 
a medicinal product from breast milk.

No phy sical examinations are scheduled to be performed during this study .
7.7. Vital Sign s
Vital signs (blood pressure [sy stolic/diastolic], pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842]) will be measured 
at the time points detailed in Table 5.
All vital signs results outside of the reference ranges will be judged b y the investigator as 
belonging to 1 of the following categories:
abnormal and not clinically  significant
abnormal and clinically  significant
Before blood pressure and pulse are measured, the patient must rest in a seated position for at 
least 5 minutes. The same position and arm should be used each time vital signs are measured for 
a given patient. Forany abnormal vital sign value, the measurement should be repeated as soon 
as possible. A ny vital sign value that is judged by  [CONTACT_16977], and monitored as 
described in Section 7.1.2.
In addition, potentially  clinically  significant values will be predefined by  [CONTACT_16978].

689. STATISTICS
This section describes the statistical anal ysis as foreseen at the time of planning the stud y. 
Changes, additions, and further details about the analy seswill be described in the Statistical 
Analy sis Plan. After finalization of the Statistical Analy sis Plan, an y additional anal yses or 
changes to analy ses that may  be required will be fully  disclosed in the CSR.
9.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The sample size was selected based on a Bay esian approach which allows for a range of 
underly ing proportions rather than a fixed predefined value.
A total of 388 patients will be enrolled in the study (accounting for 10% early dropouts), 
200patients in the DS group and 150 patients in the SoC group, to be available for anal ysis. The 
sample size determination was made assuming binomial distribution for the primary endpoint. 
An informative prior for the SoC group (Beta [9.52, 11.88]) was selected to reflect the belief that 
the response rate of the SoC group is between 30% and 60% (most likel y 45%, Merchant 2016 ) 
and the effect size between groups of 13% difference in response rates was considered clinically 
meaningful. 
In addition, an informative prior for the SoC group was selected to ensure that the mean square 
error for the Bay es estimate from the informative prior is superior to the maximum likelihood 
estimate over a range of 30% and 60% of anticipated proportion for SoC group. 
It should be noted that both power and Type 1 error are dependent on the absolute difference 
between the DS and the SoC groups as illustrated in Figure 5below b y the operational 
characteristics calculated for the stud y design.
Figure 5
: Operational Characteristics Calculated for the Study Design
MLE=maximum likelihood estimation; MSE=mean squared err or
A non -informative prior (Beta [0.5,0.5]) for the DS group was selected due to lack of availabilit y 
of data in the DS group.
With assumptions of response rates of 58% and 45% for the DS and SoC groups, respectivel y, 
sample size and randomization ratio, the probability  of the posterior odds ratio (OR) of 
 Version    
 CLN0035849 2.0 Approved Page 68 of 98
Parallel -group, Controlled Study  -Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study  FSS -AS-[ZIP_CODE]
69improvement (ie, OR>1) for the DS group versus the SoC group of at least 0.95 is about 82%. 
This will ensure a 1 -sided 5% Ty pe 1 error rate and 78% power for an effect size for 13% 
difference between the g roups provided that the proportion of responders in the SoC group is 
45%. 
9.2. Analysis Sets
9.2.1. Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set
The intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis set will include all randomized patients. In the ITT anal ysis set, 
treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were randomized, regardless 
of which treatment they  actually  received. This analy sis population will be used for 
summarization of patient disposition and demographic and baseline characteristics, as 
appropriate .
9.2.2. Modified Int ent-to-Treat Analysis Set
The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) anal ysis set is a subset of the ITT anal ysis set including only 
patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP (IMP is either FS eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16917]) and at least [ADDRESS_16144] 1 dose of 
IMP and all patients in the SoC group. In the safety anal ysis set, treatment will be assigned based 
on the treatment patients actuall y received, regardless of the treatment to which they were 
randomized, unless otherwise specified. This analy sis set will be used for all safety  anal yses.
Additional analy sis sets may  be defined in the Statistical Analy sis Plan, if appropriate.
9.3. Data Handling Conventions
For all variables, onl y the observed data from the patients will be used in the statistical anal yses, 
ie, there is no plan to estimate (impute) missing data, unless otherwise specified in the Statistical 
Analy sis Plan. 
9.3.1. Handling Withdrawals and Missing Data
For all endpoints, missing data will not be imputed, unless otherwise specified in the Statistical 
Analy sis Plan.
9.4. Study Population
The IT
T Analy sis Set (Section 9.2.1) will be used for all study  population summaries noted 
below, unless otherwise specified. Summaries will be presented f or all patients.

9.5.4. Planned Method of Analysis
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Analysis
To anal yze the primary  variable, the following estimand framew ork will be used:
1. Population: The patients met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria. The mITT analysis set will be the primary anal ysis set for the primary  endpoint. 
2.Variable: The primary  endpoint will be a binary  response vari able at Week 24. A patient 
will be defined as a responder if the patient achieves an ACT score of greater than or 
 Version    
 CLN0035849 2.[ADDRESS_16146] units from baseline to 
Week 24. Otherwise, the patient will be defined as a nonre sponder.
3.Intercurrent events: Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event, lack of efficacy , 
technology  failure, disliking the DS, disliking IMP, or other reasons. For those who 
discontinue the treatment before Week 24, no further data will be collec ted.
4.Population -level summary: The primary  endpoint will be anal yzed using a logistic model, 
where binary  variable responder rate (Yes/No) will be modeled through logit link 
function, with baseline ACT score and treatment as explanatory  factors. For those who 
discontinue the treatment before Week 24 due to technology  failure, disliking the DS, or 
disliking I MP, the patients will be defined as nonresponders; for those who discontinue 
early not due to these reasons, the response at the ET visit will be used. The mean and 
95% credible intervals of the response rates and OR from the posterior distributions will 
be calculated and presented. An informative prior will be assumed for the model 
coefficient for treatment and non- informative priors will be assumed for all other model 
coefficients. The details for the data anal ysis will be specified in the Statistical Anal ysis 
Plan.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sensitivity Analysis
If appropriate, sensitivity anal yses will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Analysis
All summari es of all secondary  endpoints will be based on the mITT anal ysis set and anal yzed 
descriptivel y. 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) 
will be provided for observed values and changes from baseline to each time point. For 
categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Analyses
No other anal yses are planned.

Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations
Protocol Amendments
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or fa vorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by  [CONTACT_16992]/I nstitutional Review Board (IEC/I RB) and national and local competent authorities, 
as applicable , except when necessary  to address immediate safety  concerns to the patients or 
when the change involves only  nonsubstantial logistics or administration. The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16932], the coordinating investigator (if applicable), and the 
sponsor will sign the protocol amendment.
Important Protocol Deviations
Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safet y, ph ysical, or 
mental integrit y of the patients in the study  and/or (b) the scientific value of the study  will be 
considered an important protocol deviation. Important prot ocol deviations may  include 
nonadherence on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol -specific 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, primary  objective variable criteria, or Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) guidelines; noncompliance to investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration; or 
use of prohibited medications. I mportant protocol deviations will be identified and recorded in 
the patient’s source documents. All important protocol deviations will be reported to the 
responsible IEC/I RB, as required.
When an important protocol deviation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to 
withdraw the patient from the study  or permit the patient to continue in the study, with 
documented approval from the medical expert. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety  
of the patient and preserving the integrit y of the study.
Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are notprospectivel y granted b y 
the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a p atient who did not meet protocol 
inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study , they  must immediately  inform the 
sponsor of the important protocol deviation. If such patient has alread y completed the study or 
has withdrawn earl y, no action will b e taken but the deviation will be recorded.
Information to Study Personnel
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study  to all personnel members 
involved in the study  or in any  element of patient management, both before starting t he stud y and 
during the course of the study  (eg, when new personnel become involved). The investigator must 
ensure that all stud y personnel are qualified b y education, experience, and training to perform 
their specific task. These study personnel members m ust be listed on the investigational center 
authorization form, which includes a clear description of each personnel member’s 
responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study , as necessary .
 Version    
 CLN0035849 2.[ADDRESS_16163] signed the informed consent form (I CF) and the study  is 
conducted according to applicable Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the protocol, and 
other written instructions and regulatory  guidelines.
The study  monitor is the primary  association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main 
responsibilities of the study  monitor(s) are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the 
study  to ensure that there is adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctly  and completel y 
recorded and re ported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before 
they participate in the study  and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance 
with I EC/IRB approvals.
The study  monitor(s) will contact [CONTACT_16993] d visit the investigational center according 
to the monitoring plan. The study  monitor will be permitted to review and verify  the various 
records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, including specific electronic source 
documents relating to the study ) to verify  adherence to the protocol and to ensure the 
completeness, consistency, and accuracy  of the data being recorded.
As part of the supervision of study  progress, other sponsor personnel may , on request, 
accompan y the study  monitor on visits to the investigational center. The investigator and 
assisting personnel must agree to cooperate with the study  monitor to resolve any  problems, 
errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected during the course of these 
monitoring visit s or provided in follow -up written communication.
In case of an emergency  situation (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), where study  monitors may  not 
be able to access the investigational centers for on -site visits, investigational centers will be 
monitored remote ly, where allowed, and in accordance with local regulations.
Audit and Inspection
The sponsor may  audit the investigational center to evaluate study  conduct and compliance with 
protocols, SOPs, GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor’s Global 
Clinical Quality  Assurance, independent of Global Specialty  Development, is responsible for 
determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit.
The investigator must accept that competent authorities and sponsor repre sentatives may  conduct 
inspections and audits to verify  compliance with GCP guidelines.
In case of an emergency  situation (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), where auditors may  not be able 
to access the investigational centers for on -site visits, investigational centers will be monitored

visits and is unable to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y the investigational center.
The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the investigational center for a 
required stud y visit:
The investigational center must attempt to contact [CONTACT_16996], counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining 
the assigned visit schedule, and ascertain whether or not the patient wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study .
In cases in which the patient is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee 
must make every  effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970] (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address, or 
local equivalent methods). These c ontact attempts should be documented in the 
patient’s medical record.
Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary  reason of ‘lost to follow -up’.

 CLN0035849 2.[ADDRESS_16165] Complaints /Device Deficiency 
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the phy sical 
quality  or characteristics of clinical IMP supplies or clinical device supplies used in a clinical 
research stud y sponsored by [CONTACT_16956]. Examples of a product complaint include but are not limited 
to:
suspected contamination
questionable stability  (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc)
defective components
missing or extra units (eg, primary  container is received at the investigational center 
with more or less than the designated number of units inside)
incorrect packaging or incorrect or missing labeling/labels
unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor, or both
device not working correctly  or appears defective in some manner
Each investigational center will be respo nsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint 
by [CONTACT_16997] 
[EMAIL_204] within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue.
For complaints involving a device/combination product or other retrievable item, it is required 
that the device/combination product (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing 
whenever possible. For complaints involving an IMP, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of 
the patient’s IMP supply ) should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever 
possible.
Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center
In the event that the product complaint form cannot be completed, the investi gator will provide 
the following information, as available:
investigational center number and principal investigator [CONTACT_2300]

Handling of Investigational Medicinal Prod uct(s) and Devices at the Investigational 
Center(s)
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigator’s clinical study  supplies. The sponsor may  request that the investigator return the 
product for further evaluation and/or anal ysis. If this is necessary , the clinical study  monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the IMP.
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all I MP or devices, the sponsor will 
provide the information needed to handle the return.
A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality  problem existing bey ond the scope 
of the complaint may  be a reason to unblind the clinical supplies for an affected patient, if
applicable.
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol 
should be followed for recording and reporting (Section 7.1.2 and Section [IP_ADDRESS], respectivel y).
Documenting a 
Product Complaint
The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint, 
the initial determination whether the deficiency  could have led to a serious adverse event 
(Section II), and any  actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safet y of the 
patient. Once the complaint has been investigated by  [CONTACT_16998], if 
necessary , an e vent closure letter may  be sent to the investigational center where the complaint 
originated or to all investigational centers using the product.
Medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be 
detected, documen ted, and reported b y the investigator throughout the study.

Data Collection
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically  designed for this study . The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management s ystem (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21CFR Part11 (US) and documents of other concerned 
competent authorities. Before using the CDMS, it will be fully  validated and all users will 
receive trainin g on the s ystem and study- specific training. After they  are trained, users will be 
provided with individual sy stem access rights.
Data will be collected at the investigational center by  [CONTACT_11399] y designated and trained 
personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent. Patient 
identity  should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF.
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanal ytical laboratory , central 
image center, electronic diary  data, electronic patient -
reported outcome [ePRO] tablet), these 
data will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not transcribed to 
the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These data may also be sent electroni cally to the 
sponsor (or organization performing data management). All patient data must have supportive 
original source documentation in the medical records, or equivalent, before they  are transcribed 
to the CRF. Data may  not be recorded directly  on the C RF and considered as source data, unless 
the sponsor provides written instructions specify ing which data are permitted to be recorded

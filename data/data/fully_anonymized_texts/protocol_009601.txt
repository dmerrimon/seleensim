1.1       Primary Objective  
1.1.1 To evaluate if the addition of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) to two schedules of radiation 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (60 Gy in 30 fractions or 60 Gy in 15 fractions)  is safe . 
 
1.2       Secondary Objectives  
1.2.1     To examine  if the addition of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) to radiation therapy is feasible . 
1.2.2     To assess toxicities associated with the addition of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) to radiation 
therapy . 
1.2.3     To obtain preliminary estimates of progression -free survival (PFS) , using RECIST 
guidelines , in patients who received MEDI4736 (durvalumab)  added to radiation . 
Although the clinical benefit of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combination with 
radiotherapy has not yet been established, the intent of offering this treatment is to 
provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and thus the patient will be carefully monitored for 
tumor response.

survival, using irRC guidelines . 
1.3.2   To assess the changes in circulating tumor cells (CTCs ) and var ious immune parameters 
during treatment with durvalumab and radiotherapy and changes after completion of 
treatment . 
 
2.0       BACKGROUND  
2.1       Current Management Approach a nd Rationale for Study  (13-JAN-2021 ) 
Initially , the FDA approved the use of frontline pembrolizumab instead of chemotherapy 
in unresectable metastatic NSCLC patients with high PD -L1 IHC expression (defined as 
a Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≥  50% using eith er the  Dako  22C3 antibody  or the 
Ventana SP263 antibody platforms ) [Reck 2017 ] based on  KEYNOTE -024, which  
demonstrated an improvement in median PFS (10.3 vs 6 months, p<0.01), and improved 
6-month overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.6=0.005).  The updated survival 
results reported at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 
2017 meeting demonstrated a HR of 0.63 [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.47 -0.86;  P = 
.002) favoring pembrolizumab.  The median OS was 30.2 months for pembrolizumab 
compared to 14.2 months with chemotherapy.  It should be noted that these OS results 
held up in spi[INVESTIGATOR_280484] -over in the second -line setting to checkpoint 
inhibitors in the patients who received chemotherapy.  Additionally, the overall response 
rate (ORR) was improved with pembrolizumab (44.8% vs 27.8%) with an increase in 
duration of response (not reached (NR) vs 6.3 months).  Quality of Life (QOL) analysis 
favored the pembrolizumab arm.  In this population of patients, PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors 
are superior to systemic chemotherapy in metastatic NSCLC.   
 
The standard of care for local -regionally advanced NSCLC is concurrent chemoradiation.  
However, 5 -year survival rates still hover around 20 -25% for stage III NSCLC.  
Additional advances in treatment options are needed.  The results of the PACIFIC trial, a 
NRG -LU004  9                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  phase III trial which adds consolidation MEDI4736 (durvalumab) to standard 
chemoradiation, demonstrated significant improvement in progression free survival (PFS) 
by 11 months (Antonia 2017).  There was not only a significantly longer time to distant 
metastatic disease or death (median 23.2 months vs. 14.6 months, HR 0.52 [(95% CI, 
0.39-0.69)] but there was also a significantly greater overall response rate [(28.4% vs 
16%, HR 1.78 (1.27 -2.51)] and median duration of response [not reached vs. 13.8 
months, HR 0.43 (0.22 -0.84)] in the primary disease after chemoradiation.  This suggests 
that immunotherapy alone can exert effects that can maintain local control of disease.  
This is seen even in patients without selection for PD -L1.  It is expected that the 
PACIFIC regimen will be a new standard of care for unresectable locally advanced 
NSCLC.  However, there is significant toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, which 
can significantly impact the patient’s quality of life and survival, especially in elderly 
patients (Stinchcombe 2017).  Since the median age of NSCLC is 70 years old, much 
work is needed for an effective and less toxic treatment regimen for patients.   
 
Conventional radiotherapy (RT) dose regimen of [ADDRESS_342162] dosing (Perez 1980, Bradley 2015).  Accelerated hypofractionated RT (ACRT) 
increases the biologic equivalent dose and thereby [CONTACT_280528]. There has 
been abundant clinical experience using ACRT without concurrent chemotherapy to 
achieve excellent local control for both early and locally advanced disease (Cheung et al, 
2014).  ACRT can also synergize with immunotherapy in many preclinical models, 
showing anti -PD-L1 antibody enhanced the efficacy of radiation through a CD8 T cell 
dependent mechanism (Deng, Weichselbaum 2014, Deng, Beckett 2014).  The anti -tumor 
effect was seen both locally in the primary tumor, and also contralateral, non -irradiated 
tumor, supporting the role of radiation inducing an immunologic “distant”, or abscopal, 
anti-tumor effect.  Even more important is the demonstration that it was the concomitant 
administration, and not the sequential administration, of anti -PD-L1 with radiation, that 
improved tumor control and survival in the mice (Dovedi et al, 2014).  
 
It is for these reasons that we believe that the systemic effects and local control effects of 
checkpoint inhibitors will even be greater in patients with high expression of PD -L1, as 
demonstrated in Keynote 024.  This is the primary rationale why we are selecting patients 
with PD -L1 high expressing tumors to replace concurrent chemotherapy for 
immunotherapy in combination with radiotherapy in our trial.  This benefit shouldn’t be 
confined to only the patients who are not eligible for chemotherapy, but all patients who 
are eligible for chemotherapy will likely benefit more from immunotherapy.   
 
However, ACRT with systemic therapy may cause concerning side effects that will be 
greater than just ACRT alone.  While this is not known if such side effects will be 
increased with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], there is experience with platinum -based doublet 
chemotherapy that may raise similar concerns.  CALGB [ZIP_CODE] (Alliance) was a phase I 
study to escalate the dose per fraction while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_280485] [ADDRESS_342163] hypofractionation was achieved, 
with the MTD defined in cohort 2 at 60 Gy in 2.5 Gy/fraction, with 2 patients in cohort 2 
sustained grade 5 toxicities (hemoptysis, pneumonitis)(Urbanic et al., 2018).  While the 
NRG -LU004  10                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  current trial does not combine chemotherapy, which is known as a radiation sensitizer, 
there are potential hazards of combining with immunotherapy that will require very close 
monitoring of the potential additive or synergistic toxicities.  We are conducting the 
current study taking those safety concerns into consideration.   
 
 MEDI4736 (durvalumab)   
 
Mechanism of action  
MEDI4736 (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin 
(Ig) G (IgG) 1 kappa subclass that blocks the interaction of programmed cell death ligand 
(PD-L) 1 (but not PD -L2) with PD -1 on T cells and cluster of differentiation (CD) 80 
(B7.1) on immune cells (IC). It is being developed by [CONTACT_38227]/MedImmune for use 
in the treatment of cancer (MedImmune is a wholly owned subsidiary of [COMPANY_008]; 
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune will be referred to as [COMPANY_008] throughout this document.).  
MEDI4736 (durvalumab) has been engineered to reduce antibody -dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity and complement -dependent cytotoxicity.  In vitro studies demonstrate that 
MEDI4736 (durvalumab) antagonizes the inhibitory effect of PD -L1 on primary h uman T 
cells, resulting in their restored proliferation and release of interferon gamma (IFNγ) 
(Stewart et al, 2015).  
2.2       Clinical pharmacokinetics (PK)  
As of October 24, 2016, PK data from study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108  were available for 
993 patients f ollowing treatment with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) at 0.1 to 10 mg/kg every 
two weeks (Q2W) and 15 mg/kg every three weeks (Q3W) (dose -escalation), 10 mg/kg 
Q2W (dose -expansion), and 20 mg/kg every four weeks (Q4W) (dose -exploration), 
administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 60 minutes.  The maximum plasma 
concentration (C max) increased in an approximately dose -proportional manner over the 
dose range examined.  The area under the concentration -time curve from 0 to 14 days 
(AUC 0-14) increased dose -proportionally at doses of 3 to 20 mg/kg and more than dose -
proportionally at doses of <3 mg/kg, likely due to saturable target -mediated clearance 
(CL).  The steady state was achieved at approximately Week 16.  Accumulation of 
MEDI4736 (durvalumab) was observed following repeated dosing.  Mean accumulation 
ratio (AR) ranged from 0.64 to 1.87 and 3.16 to 4.93 for C max and (trough plasma 
concentration (C trough), respectively.  Near complete target saturation (sPD -L1 and 
membrane bound) is expected with MEDI4736 (du rvalumab) ≥3 mg/kg Q2W.  
 
Clinical safety summary  
As of July 12, 2017, MEDI4736 (durvalumab) 10 mg/kg Q2W has been given to more 
than 1800 patients from three MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy studies (CD -ON-
MEDI4736 -1108, ATLANTIC and PACIFIC).  The majori ty of treatment -related AEs 
were manageable with dose delays, symptomatic treatment, and in the case of events 
suspected to have an immune basis, the use of established treatment guidelines for 
immune -mediated toxicity (see the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management 
Guidelines in Section 6 ).  However, life -threatening and fatal events have been reported.

(8.0%), nausea (7.2%), pruritus (6.9%), decreased appetite (6.4%), and rash (6.4%).  AEs 
of Grade 3 or higher considered related to MEDI4736 (durvalumab) were reported in 201 
patient s (10.6%): 177 patients (9.4%) had events of Grade 3, 13 patients (0.7%) had 
events of Grade 4, and 11 patients (0.6%) had Grade 5 (fatal) events.  The only Grade 5 
event considered related to MEDI4736 (durvalumab) occurring in ≥2 patients was 
pneumonitis (5 patients [0.3%]).  A  total of 108 patients  (5.7%) had serious  AEs (SAEs)  
that were considered by [CONTACT_280530]4736 (durvalumab).   
 
AEs of special interest (AESI)  
The AESIs reported in [COMPANY_008] or MedImmune -sponsored MEDI4736 (durvalumab) 
studies are defined as AEs that include, but are not limited to, events with a potential 
inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism that may require more frequent 
monitoring and/or interventions such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or 
endocrine therapy.   
 
Early recognition of signs and symptoms potentially related to an inflammatory or 
immune -mediated mechanism is important for proper management of toxicities.  For 
guidance on identifying, evaluating, and treating AESIs/imAEs, see the Toxicity 
Management Guidelines.  
 
AESI/imAEs observed with anti PD -L1/PD -1 agents such as MEDI4736 (durvalumab) 
include pneumonitis, hepatitis, diarrhea/colitis and intestinal perforation, 
endocrinopathies (hypo - and hyper -thyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, 
hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_280486] 1 diabetes mellitus), nephritis, rash/dermatitis, 
pancreatitis, myocarditis, myositis/polymyositis and rare/less frequent imAEs including 
neuromuscular toxicities such as myasthenia gravis and Guillain -Barre syndrome.  
 
Other inflammatory responses that are rare with a potential immune -mediated etiology 
include, but are not limited to, pericarditis, sarcoidosis, uveitis and other events involving 
the eye, skin, hematological and rheumatological events.  It is possible that events with 
an inflammatory or immune mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all organs.  
 
In addition, infusion -related reactions and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions with a 
different underlying pharmacological etiology are also considered AESIs.  
 
The summary information for the AESIs below, unless stated otherwise, are based on the 
DCO of July 12, 2017.  
 
Pneumonitis  
Across the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy pooled dataset pneumonitis events 
observed (pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), acute interstitial pneumonitis and 
pulmonary fibrosis) were reported at a frequency rate of Common (98/1889; 5.2%).  
Most were Grade [ADDRESS_342164] were reported as PT pneumonitis (88 
patients [4.7%]).  CTC Grade 3 pneumonitis (PT) was reported in 15 patients (0.8%); 
NRG -LU004  12                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  CTC Grade 4 in 1 patient (<0.1%) and CTC Grade 5 pneumonitis in 5 patients (0.3%).  
CTC Grade 3 ILD (PT) has been reported from studies outside of the pooled dataset.  
There were no CTC Grade 4 or 5 events of ILD.  
 
Presentations of pneumonitis can range from asymptomatic lung infiltrates to those that 
mimic severe bacterial pneumonia (Teply and Lipson 2014).  Early consideration of 
pneumonitis should be realized when patients present with new onset or worsening of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_280487].  Prompt treatment with steroids is 
important as per current established Toxicity Management Guidelines.  
 
Hepatitis  
Immune -mediated hepatitis/hepatic toxicity is the inflammation of the liver.  Hepatic AEs 
induced by [CONTACT_4002] -1/PD -L1 inhibitors commonly present as asymptomatic increase of 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), rarely total 
bilirubin.  A proportion of patients may be presenting with fatigue, fever and radiologic 
appearances including hepatomegaly, periportal lymphadenopathy and periportal edema 
(Zhang et al, 2016).  
 
As a grouped term, selected hepatic events including laboratory abnormalities were 
reportedly 12.0% (227 patients) across [ADDRESS_342165] received MEDI4736 
(durvalumab) monotherapy 10 mg/kg Q2W.  Hepatitis events (autoimmune hepatitis, 
hepatitis toxic, hepatocellular injury, hepatotoxicity and hepatitis) were reported at a 
frequency rate of Uncommon (14 patients; 0.7%).  Seven of the 14 events of hepatitis 
were Grade 3.  There were no Grade 4 events with the exception of hepatitis acute (1 
patient) reported outside of the pooled dataset.  One patient experienced a CTC Grade 5 
event of autoimmune hepatitis.  Other AESIs such as hepatic failure (5 patients), jaundice 
(5 patients), hyperbilirubinemia (15 patients) and laboratory abnormality AESIs have 
been observed, 3 of which were CTC Grade 5 (hepatic failure, hyperbilirubinemia and 
transaminases increased).   
 
Monitoring liver function tests while receiving study medication is important as hepatitis 
often manifests as asymptomatic elevated levels of hepatic transaminases (ALT, AST, 
bilirubin; Kim et al, 2013).  Prompt treatment with steroids is important as per current 
established Toxicity Management Guidelines.  
 
Colitis  
Diarrhea is the most frequent AESI reported across the Phase I to Phase III clinical 
studies with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy with a frequency of Very common 
(329/1889; 17.4%) in patients receiving 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 (durvalumab) IV Q2W.  
Most of these were Grade 1.  Treatment -emergent colitis -type AESIs were reported at a 
frequency of Common (21 of 1889 patients; 1.1%).  Most were Grade 2 or 3.  CTC Grade 
4 colitis was reported in 1 patient (rare; <0.1%).  
 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis or diarrhea.  Investigators 
are instructed to begin diarrhea management early to minimize the risk of colitis (please 
refer to the Toxicity Management Guidelines).  Early initiation of diarrhea treatment 
NRG -LU004  13                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  guidelines has been shown to reduce bowel perforation and colectomy rates, drug -related 
diarrhea, and serious gastrointestinal imAEs by [CONTACT_8622] 50% in patients treated with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Tarhini 2013).  
 
Intestinal perforation  
Full thickness injury of the bowel wall and subsequent perforation of the gastrointestinal 
tract can be due to a variety of etiologies, commonly instrumentation, surgery, bowel 
injury, bowel obstruction, neoplasms (particularly colon carcinoma) and concomitant 
medications such as prolonged use of non -steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  
Spontaneous perforation can be related to inflammatory changes or tissues weakened by 
[CONTACT_280531] (Cahalane 2016).   
 
Across the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy pool of studies, intestinal perforation 
was reported at a frequency rate of Uncommon (2/1889; 0.1%); Grades 2 and 4.  There 
were no Grade 5 events.  
 
Monitor for symptoms that may be related to bowel perforation such as sepsis, peritoneal 
signs, and ileus (refer to the Toxicity Management Guidelines for diarrhea/colitis).  
Investigators should adhere to the overall management for immune -mediated toxicities 
by [CONTACT_746] a thorough evaluation to rule out alternative etiologies and by [CONTACT_280532].  
 
Endocrinopathies  
Immune -mediated endocrinopathy is the inflammation of any organ in the hypothalamic -
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal axis, but is most typi[INVESTIGATOR_280488], thyroid and/or 
adrenal glands, leading to hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], thyroid dysfunction, and/or 
adrenal insufficiency (Teply and Lipson 2014).  The clinical presentation of immune -
mediated endocrinopathies most often include hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and 
nonspecific symptoms of headache and fatigue, but may also include myalgias, visual 
field defects, behavioral changes, electrolyte disturbances, loss of appetite and 
hypotension (Tarhini 2013).  Patients with endocrinopathies may present with abnormal 
endocrine laboratory test results including thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH), free T4, 
total and free T3, cortisol, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle -
stimulating hormone, and testosterone.  
 
Frequencies for immune -mediated endocrinopathy, as grouped terms of AESIs including 
laboratory abnormality AEs, are indicated in the table below.

N total number of patients; PT preferred term; Q2W every 2 weeks; Q4W every [ADDRESS_342166] endocrinopathy events reported were Grade 1 or 2.  In the monotherapy pool, Grade 
3 events consisted of adrenal insufficiency (2 patients), hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297] (1 
patient), hyperthyroidism (1 patient) and hypothyroidism (2 patients).  There were no 
CTC Grade 4 or 5 events.  In the combination, AESIs for hypothyroidism and 
hyperthyroidism (including laboratory abnormalities) were the most frequently observed 
events with frequency rates of Very common (12.6%) and Common (7.2%), respectively.  
The severity of these events are predominantly Grades 1 and 2 with Grade 3 events 
observed with hyperthyroidism only (0.5%).  Adrenal insufficiency was reported as 
mostly Grades 2/3 with 1 Grade 4 event and no Grade 5 events.  Hypophysitis or 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_280489] 3 with no Grade 4 or 5 events.  
 
Across the monotherapy pool of studies, 1 patient (<0.1%) experienced Grade 3 Type 1 
diabetes mellitus.  The patient, a 60 year old Caucasian male with NSCLC without a 
history of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia, developed severe autoimmune -mediated 
hyperglycemia (blood glucose 458 mg/dL) 43 days after starting MEDI4736 
(durvalumab), was tested positive for anti -GAD antibody 322 U/mL (reference range 0 
to 5 U/mL) and was negative for B -islet antibody.  He was diagnosed with Type 1 
diabetes mellitus and was treated with insulin; the DM resolved with sequelae (insulin 
dependency).   
 
Prompt recognition and management of endocrinopathies is important.  Refer to the 
endocrinology section of the Toxicity Management Guidelines.  
 
Nephritis  
The major clinical syndromes produced by [CONTACT_44859] -mediated renal injury include 
nephrotic syndrome, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_103020], and acute renal failure 
(Cunard and Kelly 2003).  In association to immune -checkpoint inhibitors, two different 
forms of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -induced renal damage are reported, acute kidney injury due to 
predominant acute granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome in 
lupus nephritis (Izzedine et al, 2014).  Signs and symptoms include increase in serum 
creatinine, decrease in urine output, peripheral edema, hematuria, loss of appetite.  
  
As a grouped term, selected renal events including laboratory abnormalities were 
reported at a frequency of 6.3% (119 patients) across the 1889 patients included in the 
MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy pool.  Blood creatinine was the most common 
event reported (4.0%), of which the majority were Grade 1 or 2 in severity.  Nephritis 
events were reported at a frequency rate of Uncommon (6 patients [0.3%]) with 1 event 
NRG -LU004  15                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  each of Grade 2 autoimmune nephritis, glomerulonephritis, glomerulonephritis 
membranous, and nephritis and 2 tubulointerstitial nephritis (Grade 2 and 3).   
 
Patients should be monitored for changes in renal function (e.g., that manifest as elevated 
serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, decreased creatinine CL, electrolyte imbalance, 
decrease in urine output, or proteinuria and any other findings that may be indicative of 
nephritis) prior to and periodically during treatment.  Prompt treatment with steroids is 
important as per current established Toxicity Management Guidelines.  
 
Rash/dermatitis  
Immune -mediated dermatitis is generally mild and presents as mild local or diffuse 
maculo -papular, erythematous rash on the trunk or extremities, which may be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_99407], alopecia, and vitiligo, suggestive of inflammatory response to 
melanocytes (Lacouture et al, 2014).  In rare cases, severe dermatitis has been reported to 
manifest as Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], or rashes complicated 
by [CONTACT_280533], bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations (Tarhini et al, 
2013, Kaehler et al, 2010).  
 
AESIs of rash (as a composite term) were reported as Very common in 283 (15.0%) 
patients receiving MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy and Very common in 256 
(23.5%) patients receiving the combination.  The majority of events were CTC Grade 1, 
with [ADDRESS_342167] been reported as Very common (n=299; 15.8%) in monotherapy.  Most events were 
Grade 1, with 3 patients in the monotherapy group.  
 
Close monitoring, early detection and prompt treatment with steroids (topi[INVESTIGATOR_280490]) is important.  Refer to the Toxicity Management Guidelines.  
 
Myocarditis  
In the literature for other immune checkpoint inhibitors, a variety of clinical presentations, 
diagnostic evidence (laboratory, imaging, histopathology), and resulting diagnoses have 
been described in cases of myocarditis, including heart failure, brady - and 
tachyarrhythmias, and acute coronary syndrome -like presentations without evidence of 
ischemia.  Treatments are variable, and include immunosuppression and beta blockers, 
ACE inhibitors, and diuretics.  Outcomes can range from rapid response and resolution 
with immunosuppression to fulminant, fatal events.  
 
Across the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy pool of studies, as of the DCO of July 
12, 2017, there has been 1 serious report of Grade 3 myocarditis and 2 additional cases 
(Grade 3 and Grade 4) outside of the pooled dataset.  In all cases the patients recovered or 
were improving with corticosteroid therapy.  
 
NRG -LU004  16                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  Investigators should be aware of such rare, but severe immune -mediated adverse events 
including myocarditis with its presenting signs/symptoms (e.g., decreased ejection 
fraction, arrhythmias, in particular occurrences of atrioventricular block).   
 
For patients with suspected myocarditis, investigators should obtain a cardiology consult 
and institute full diagnostic work -up (that includes exclusion of other alternate causes 
such as infection) and the appropriate management that includes discontinuing drug 
(permanently if myocarditis is confirmed) and the prompt use of steroids or other 
immunsosuppressives.  Patients with pre -existing cardiac disorders should be closely 
monitored for deterioration in their cardiac condition, which could suggest new onset 
myocarditis.  
 
Myositis/polymyositis  
The diagnosis of myositis or polymyositis should be suspected in patients who present 
with proximal muscle weakness and the evaluation should include an examination of the 
skin, muscle enzyme measurement, antibody testing, any systemic disease manifestations 
and exclusion of other diseases including drug -induced myopathy.  Cases of myositis 
have been reported with myocarditis in which immune infiltration has been described in 
skeletal and cardiac muscle (Johnson et al, 2016).  
 
In the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) pool of studies as of the DCO, 3 patients (0.2%) 
reported the event of myositis, including 1 Grade 3 in severity.  Outside of the pooled 
dataset, there were 2 fatal events of polymyositis considered as treatment -related by [CONTACT_3786].  
 
Investigators should adhere to the Toxicity Management Guidelines by [CONTACT_746] a 
thorough evaluation to rule out alternative etiologies and initiating prompt treatment with 
steroids and modification of study drug dose regimen depending on the severity of the 
event.  Refer to the Toxicity Management Guidelines.  
 
Pancreatitis  
Pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas that typi[INVESTIGATOR_280491].  Clinical presentation frequently includes low -grade abdominal 
pain with accompanying fever and malaise (Weber et al, 2012, Di Giacomo et al, 2010).  
Biopsies showed diffuse T -cell infiltrate consistent with immune -mediated pancreatitis 
(Weber et al, 2012).  
 
Across the 1889 patients in the monotherapy program, events of pancreatitis were 
Uncommon to Rare.  Four patients (0.2%) experienced pancreatitis (Grade 2, Grade 3 and 
Grade 4 in severity) and 1 patient (<0.1%) with Grade 3 acute pancreatitis.  Elevations in 
amylase and lipase were reported as Uncommon (0.6% and 0.5%, respectively).   
 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis including Grade 3 or 
4 elevations in lipase and/or amylase.  Close monitoring, early detection and prompt 
treatment of these events are important.  Refer to the Toxicity Management Guidelines.  
NRG -LU004  17                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021   
Other rare or less frequent AESIs and immune -mediated adverse events  
Events with an inflammatory or immune mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all 
organs.  ImAEs that are less frequent with a potential immune -mediated etiology include, 
but are not limited to:  pericarditis, sarcoidosis, uveitis, and other events involving the eye 
(e.g., keratitis and optic neuritis), skin (e.g., scleroderma and vitiligo), hematological 
(e.g., hemolytic anemia and, immune thrombocytopenic purpura) and rheumatological 
events (polymyalgia rheumatic and autoimmune arthritis).  
 
Neuropathy/neuromuscular toxicities such as Guillain -Barre Syndrome and myasthenia 
gravis have also been observed.  One patient receiving MEDI4736 (durvalumab) 
monotherapy outside of the pooled dataset experienced Grade [ADDRESS_342168] or second 
exposure to the agent, but between 10% and 30% occur during subsequent treatments 
(Lenz 2007).  
 
Anaphylaxis is a systemic, immediate hypersensitivity reaction that is mediated by 
[CONTACT_280534]; these interactions result in 
an antigen -antibody reaction.  Clinical manifestations of acute allergic reactions may 
range from localized skin reactions at the injection site to AEs, which can include, but are 
not limited to, those events similar to infusion -related reactions to severe reactions 
including anaphylaxis and drug hypersensitivity syndromes.  These reactions may be 
more common with higher rates of infusion, and in patients with a history of allergies.  
 
Patients participating in MEDI4736 (durvalumab) clinical studies should be closely 
monitored during and after infusions.  Severe hypersensitivity reactions should be 
managed according to standard clinical practice, and medical equipment and staff trained 
to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available at all sites that 
perform mAb infusions.  
 
Cytokine release syndrome  
Certain mAb therapeutics have been shown to induce a range of acute infusion reactions 
including cytokine -release syndrome that can lead to AEs in patients.  As of the DCO 
date, there have been no reported events of cytokine release syndrome in the ongoing 
MEDI4736 (durvalumab) studies.  
NRG -LU004  18                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021   
Immune -complex disease  
The potential risk of immune complex disease for MEDI4736 (durvalumab) is theoretical 
based on the known risk associated with mAbs and other proteins.  The incidence of 
MEDI4736 (durvalumab) ADA -positive patients in clinical studies is low, and hence the 
risk of immune complex disease is likely to be low.  Specifically, of 1124 patients treated 
with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) 10 mg/kg Q2W and evaluable for the presence of ADAs, 
3.3% of patients tested positive for treatment -emergent ADAs.  Neutralizing antibodies 
against MEDI4736 (durvalumab) were detected in 0.3% of patients.  The presence of 
ADAs did not have a clinically relevant effect on PK.  There have been no reported events 
of immune complex reactions in patients receiving MEDI4736 (durvalumab).  
 
 
For guidance on identifying, evaluating, and treating an imAE please see the Toxicity 
Management Guidelines.  
 
2.2.2    Infections  
In addition to infections determined as ADRs, other infections are considered as potential 
risks based on the potential mechanism of action of checkpoint inhibitors.  
 
Serious and/or ≥Grade [ADDRESS_342169] been reported in clinical studies with 
MEDI4736 (durvalumab), but are often confounded by [CONTACT_280535] (e.g., steroids and other immunosuppressives).  As of the DCO, 
events from the MedDRA Infections and Infestations SOC, events with a severity ≥Grade 
3 and frequency of ≥1% in the monotherapy pool included lung infection (n=19; 1%), 
pneumonia (n=51; 2.7%), sepsis (n=35; 1.9%) and urinary tract infection (n=21; 1.1%).  
Overall, CTC Grade 3 events were reported in 143 patients (7.6%), CTC Grade 4 events 
were reported in 36 patients (1.9%) and CTC Grade 5 infection events in 18 patients 
(1.0%).   
 
Non-serious infections have been reported in clinical studies with MEDI4736 
(durvalumab).  Of the ADRs under the MedDRA Infections and Infestations SOC, events 
reported as non -serious only and with a frequency of >1% included nasopharyngitis 
(n=92; 4.9%), oral candidiasis (n=49; 2.6%), pharyngitis (n=20; 1.1%) and rhinitis (n=39; 
2.1%).

Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [Eisenhauer 2009] which will be site -reported.  Immune -Related Response Criteria 
(irRC) guidelines for treatment response (ESMO guidelines, Haanen 2017) will also be 
calculated by [CONTACT_280540] -reported tumor measurements .  See Appendix I for 
details.  
5. TREATMENT PLAN/R EGIMEN DESCRIPTION  
Systemic therapy protocol treatment with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) must start within 2 weeks of 
trial registration and 2 weeks  (Day -14) prior (+/ - 48 hours) to the start of RT.   
5.1 MEDI4736 (durvalumab)   
NOTE:  Please refer to the Investigator Brochure for complete details on safety and 
treatment information.  [See Section 9 .1 for instructions about how to obtain the IB and 
preparation of MEDI4736 (durvalumab).]  
 
MEDI4736 (durvalumab) will be administered intravenously as a 1500  mg fixed dose over 60 
minutes starting 2 weeks ( Day -14 +/- 48 hours) prior to starting radiation therapy, for 13 cycles 
(1 cycle = 4 weeks), until disease progression or toxicity or death, whichever comes first (see 
Section 5.2.6 ).  Patients must  be monitored before and after the infusion with assessment of vital 
signs at the times specified in Section [ADDRESS_342187]  be monitored  (pulse rate, blood pressure) every 30 minutes (including times where 
infusion rate is slowed or temporarily stopped).  
 
If RT is held or discontinued, MEDI4736 (durvalumab) may be continued as scheduled.  In 
patients who require dose delays, MEDI4736 (durvalumab) will be continued as soon as the 
patient meets retreatment criteria, and the full dose of 1500 mg will be administered. If the 
patient does not meet retreatment criteria before the next scheduled dose, if/when the toxicity 
resolves to the point where treatment is possible, the doses of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) are 
applied off schedule q 4 weeks.  The missing doses will not be made up.

5.2 Radiation Therapy  (25-NOV -2019 ) 
Radiation therapy protocol treatment must begin within 2 weeks ( Day -14 +/- 48 hours) after 
start of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) administration.  Pre-treatment review is required for each 
treatment plan prior to the start of RT.   Three (3) business days are required for the pre -
treatment review once all required data is received in completion.  Refer to Section 12.1  for 
submission details.  Daily IGRT will be used for all patients.  
 
5.2.1  Treatment Technology  
Three -dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D -CRT) or Intensity Modulated Radiation 
Therapy (IMRT) is allowed.  Proton Beam Therapy is not allowed.  IMRT delivered from units 
with capabilities including Tomotherapy, ViewRay and VMAT are permitted.  For photons, 
beam energy of 6 -10 MV will be used.  Daily image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) using 
orthogonal X -ray, cone beam CT, CT on rails, or MR guidance must be used for all patients, 
regardless of radiation techniques.  Multi -leaf collimation (MLC) will be used to spare normal 
tissues outside of the target volume.  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_342189] be achieved 
using appropriate clinical devices.   Alpha cradles or Vac-Lok devices are used for shoulder 
immobilization.  Arms are abducted bilaterally with hands above the head (preferably in all cases 
unless patients are incapable of doing so but setup must be reproducible daily and treatment 
planning will accommodate for the deviation).  
 
Simulation Imaging  
Simulation CTs should be CT slices of 3 mm slice thickness starting from the level of the cricoid 
cartilage and extending inferiorly through the entire liver volume.  Administration of intravenous 
(I.V.) contrast during simulation CT is optional provided a diagnostic CT with contrast has been 
done to help delineate the major blood vessels.  If such diagnostic CT is not available, I.V. 
contrast should be given during the treatment planning CT.  In the case in which contrast is 
present during the treatment planning CT, the density of the contrast should be overridden to a 
representative background electron density.  
 
NRG -LU004  28                        Version Date:  November 3, [ADDRESS_342190] study will be required to define gross tumor volume (GTV), 
clinical target volume (CTV), and planning target volume (PTV)(see definitions below).  
Contiguous CT slices, having no more than [ADDRESS_342191] slices.  A treatment planning FDG PET/CT scan (or FDG -PET 
alone) with the patient in the treatment position is encouraged for treatment planning.  In the case 
where the PET/CT is obtained in the treatment position, the CT from this study may be used as 
the planning CT scan.  Otherwise, a diagnostic PET/CT used for staging could be used for target 
delineation with image co -registration with the planning CT.   
 
5.2.4  Definition of Target Volumes and Margins  
Note: All structures must be named for digital RT data submission as listed in the table below.  
The structures marked as “Required” in the table must be contoured and submitted with the 
treatment plan. Structures marked as “Required when applicable” must be contoured and 
submitted when applicable.  Resubmission of data may be required if labeling of structures does 
not conform to the standard DICOM name [CONTACT_121056].  Capi[INVESTIGATOR_1791], spacing and use of underscores 
must be applied exactly as indicated.  
 
There are two tables below. The first table (Table A) applies to patients being treated using the 
non-preferred motion management method.  The second table (Table B) applies only to patients 
being planned with 4DCT with maximum intensity projection of the tumor volume based on the 
entire tumor motion.   
 
Contouring of the ITV_6000 is necessary only when the ITV approach is used.

Detailed Specifications  
Target volumes: The definitions of volumes will be in accordance with the ICRU 50 (1999) for 
3D and ICRU 83 (2010) for IMRT.  
 
Accounting for Tumor Motion Approaches and Internal and Setup Margins  
Internal margin (IM): The IM used will be dictated by [CONTACT_280541].   
1. If the simulation is done with a free -breathing CT only, the IM will be [ADDRESS_342192] to develop a maximum intensity projection of the 
tumor volume, no IM is needed.   
 
Setup margin (SM):  Daily IGRT is a requirement for this trial; therefore, the SM will be 0.5 cm 
in all directions.  
GTV_6000 :  The primary tumor and clinically positive lymph nodes seen either on the planning 
CT 
(> 1cm short axis diameter) or pre -treatment PET scan (SUV > 3) will constitute the GTV.  This 
volume(s) may be disjointed.  In the event of a collapsed lobe or lung segment, the use of PET to 
distinguish tumor from fluid/atelectasis is encouraged.  
CTV_6000 :  The CTV is defined to be the GTV plus a 0.5cm to 1cm margin as appropriate to 
account for microscopic tumor extension.  If an IGTV is used then a 0.5cm to 1cm margin is 
added to the IGTV to form a CTV.  The CTV should be adjusted to not expand into other organs 
such as esophagus, major blood vessels, or bone.  
IGTV_6000:  The primary tumor and clinically positive lymph nodes seen on the planning CT (> 
1 cm short axis diameter) and pre -treatment PET scan (SUV > 3) over the course of a respi[INVESTIGATOR_280493]. This volume(s) may be disjointed. In the event of a collapsed lobe or lung segment, the 
use of PET to distinguish tumor from fluid/atelectasis is encouraged.  Maximum intensity 
projection image may be used for contouring, with verification against all breathing phases.  
 
NRG -LU004  30                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  ITV_6000:  The ITV will be equal to the IGTV plus a 0.5 cm clinical margin as appropriate to 
account for microscopic tumor extension.  
PTV_6000 :  The PTV will be equal to the ITV+IM+SM.  SM is defined in Detailed 
Specifications paragraph above.  In cases in which the PTV expansion extends outside of the 
skin, towards the spi[INVESTIGATOR_280494], it can be assumed that tumor motion will 
not occur in this direction, and the PTV margin in this direction can be limited.  PTV margin can 
be limited up to 0.5cm towards this particular dimension (skin or spi[INVESTIGATOR_158470]).

Note: The information provided in this section can be used for adjusting the dose constraints for 
treatment planning purposes.  This table together with the planning priority table should be used 
during dose optimization.  It is important to remember that ideal plans might not be achievable in 
all cases.  Thus, the Compliance Criteria table could be different than the information given here.  
Cases will be scored using the Compliance Criteria table.

5.2.7  Compliance Criteria   
The compliance criteria listed here will be used to score each case.  Given the limitations 
inherent in the treatment planning process, the numbers given in this section can be different than 
the prescription table.  The Per Protocol and Variation Acceptable categories are both considered 
to be acceptable.  The Per Protocol cases can be viewed as ideal plans, and the Variation 
Acceptable category can include more challenging plans that do not fall at or near the ideal 
results.  A final category, called Deviation Unacceptable, results when cases do not meet the 
requirements for either Per Protocol or Variation Acceptable. Plans falling in this category are 
considered to be suboptimal and additional treatment planning optimization is recommended.  
 
Normalization of Dose:  The plan is normalized such that 95% of the PTV_6000 volume 
receives prescription dose of 60 Gy.

Dose Calculations  
Acceptable choices of algorithm are listed at http://irochouston.mdanderson.org.  Any algorithm 
used for this study must be credentialed by [CONTACT_280542].  
 
For Convolution/Superposition type algorithms, dose should be reported as computed inherently 
by [CONTACT_280543].   For Monte Carlo or Grid Based Boltzmann Solver algorithms, 
conversion of Dm (dose -to-medium) to Dw (dose -to-water) should be avoided.  Dm, computed 
inherently by [CONTACT_280544], should be reported. These principles hold for Pencil Beam type 
algorithms and for homogeneous dose calculations when allowed for a clinical trial (e.g., conical 
collimators in stereotactic radiosurgery).  
 
Primary dataset for dose calculation  
The primary dataset for dose calculation must be a free -breathing CT that was acquired along 
with 4DCT, an average intensity pi[INVESTIGATOR_280498] (AveIP) generated from the 4DCT, the breath -
hold/gated CT, or the free -breathing CT acquired with no other motion management.  Maximum 
Intensity Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070] (MIP) generated images from 4DCTs may not be used as the primary dose 
calculation dataset. In the case in which contrast is present during the treatment planning CT, the 
density of the contrast should be overridden to a representative background electron density.  
Dose matrix resolution  
Dose grid size should be <= 3 mm in all directions.  
 
5.2.9     Patient specific QA  
Any patient -specific QA that needs to be acquired should follow institutional guidelines and 
AAPM task group report recommendations.  
 
For IMRT/VMAT plans, patient specific QA is highly recommended. The recommended patient 
specific QA criterion is for 90% of the comparison points to pass a ±3%/3mm Gamma Index 
analysis.  
 
5.2.10   Daily Treatment Localization/IGRT  
Image -guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is radiation therapy using imaging to facilitate accuracy 
and precision throughout its entire process from target and normal tissue delineation, to radiation 
delivery, to adaptation of therapy to anatomic and biological changes over time in individual 
patients. In this section we use the terminology IGRT to focus on image -guidance at the time of 
radiation delivery to ensure its adherence to the planned treatment.

carina can help for mediastinal alignment.  Fiducial markers can be used for localization as 
needed.  Bony alignment as a surrogate is also acceptable.  Any linear shifts seen that are ≥2 mm 
should be applied prior to treat ment.

**Clearly visible anatomical markers are acceptable as fiducials, e.g. inserted radio opaque 
markers.  
 
5.2.11 Case Review  
Pre-treatment reviews are required for all cases .  See Sections 8.3  and 12.1 for specifics on 
submission process and requirements.  RT may not begin until approval is received.  Three (3) 
business days are required for the pre -treatment review once all required data is received in 
completion.    
5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
5.3.1  Permitted Supportive/Ancillary Care and Concomitant Medications  
 All supportive therapy for optimal medical care will be given during the study period at 
the discretion of the attending physician(s) within the parameters of the protocol and 
documented on each site’s source documents as concomitant medication.    
▪ Anticonvulsants  
▪ Antiemetics  
▪ Anticoagulants  
▪ Antidiarrheals  
▪ Analgesics  
▪ Hematopoietic Growth Factors  
▪ Nutritional supplementation  
▪ Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)  
▪ Megastrol administered as appetite stimulant is acceptable while the patient is 
enrolled in the study   
▪ Premedication may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician.  
▪ The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for 
patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed.  
5.3.2  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_280499]:   
▪ Traditional herbal medicines should not be administered because the ingredients of 
many herbal medicines are not fully studied and their use may result in unanticipated 
drug interactions that may cause, or confound assessment of, toxicity;  
▪ Patients are not allowed to receive immunostimulatory agents, including but n ot 
 
NRG -LU004  37                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  limited to IFN -α, IFN -γ, or IL -2, during the entire study.  These agents, in 
combination with MEDI4736 (durvalumab), could potentially increase the risk for 
autoimmune conditions.  
▪ Patients should also not be receiving immunosuppressive medications, incl uding but 
not limited to cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, or thalidomide.  These 
agents could potentially alter the activity and the safety of MEDI4736 (durvalumab).  
Systemic corticosteroids may be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  If feasible, alternatives should be considered.   
▪ Patients who donate blood while participating in this study, or:  1) for at least [ADDRESS_342203] infusion of durvalumab; or 2) 90 days after receipt of the final dose 
of durvalumab; or 3) until after [ADDRESS_342204].  
▪ Colony stimulating factors, including G -CSF, pegylated G -CSF are not permitted at 
any time.  Erythropoietin analogs are not recommended, but may be used in 
accordance with ASCO guidelines.  
▪ Immunotherapy, chemotherapy or radiation therapy not specified in this protocol  
▪ Investigational agents other than MEDI4736 (durvalumab).  
▪ Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_342205] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typhoid (oral) vaccine.  Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed 
virus vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu -
Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.  
▪ Glucocorticoids for any purpose other than the following two clinical situations:  
o To control radiation -related nausea, if viewed as absolutely necessary for 
symptom control by [CONTACT_280545].  Every effort should be made to 
minimize glucocorticoid administration, e.g. utilization of appropriate 
alternative medications including 5HT3, NK -1 antagonists, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_280500]. 
(note:  no more than 4 mg decadron or 10 mg prednisone daily).  
o To modulate symptoms from an adverse event of suspected immunologic 
etiology.  Note: The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (e.g. ≤ 10 mg 
per day of prednisone or equivalent) may be approved after consultation with 
the Principal Investigator.  
o Patients who, in the assessment of the treating investigator, require the use of 
any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical manage ment should be 
removed from protocol treatment.  Patients may receive other medications that 
the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
 
5.3.3  Participation in Other Trials   
• Patients are not to participate in other therapeutic trials.  However, trials that do not 
add experimental agents are allowed (e.g. imaging trials, quality of life, etc).  
5.4     Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue as 
specified in the above treatment modality sections or until one of the following criteria 
 
NRG -LU004  38                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  applies:  
▪ Completion of all 13 cycles of MEDI4736 (durvalumab),  
▪ Disease progression * 
▪ Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
▪ Unacceptable adverse event(s), as described in Section 6  
▪ Patient decides to withdraw consent for participation in the study, or  
▪ General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
*At time of disease progression, patients will be managed per the discretion of the treating 
physician and will continue to be followed per the follow -up assessmen ts in Section 4 of the 
protocol .   
6.  TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS/ MANAGEMENT  (13-JAN -2021 ) 
6.1      Toxicity Management Guidelines for Radiation -Related , Immune -Mediated, 
Infusion -Related, and Non -Immune Mediated Reactions for MEDI4736 
(durvalumab)  
Radiation -Related Toxicities:  
Severe adverse events that may be related to radiation therapy during the course of radiation such 
as any grade 3 -4 cardiopulmonary SAEs (congestive heart failure, pneumonitis, arrhythmias, 
myocardial infarction), grade 4 esophagitis, or any AEs that lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_280501].  RT could be resumed if AEs return to grade 2 or less, but if the AEs do not 
return to grade 2 or less within 14 days, RT will be permanently discontinued.   
 
MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) Related -Toxicities:  
For MEDI4736 (durvalumab),  there will not be any dose escalation or de -escalation.  If the 
MEDI4736 (durvalumab) dose is held or interrupted it will not be made up.  If RT is held or 
discontinued, MEDI4736 (durvalumab) may be continued as scheduled.  If the patient meets 
retreatment criteria, the full dose of 1500 mg will be administered. If the patient does not meet 
retreatment criteria before the next scheduled dose, if/when the toxicity resolves to the point 
where treatment is possible, the doses of MEDI4736 ( durvalumab) are applied off schedule every 
4 weeks.  
 
Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with MEDI4736 ( durvalumab) 
exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These adverse events may occur shortly after 
the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. MEDI4736 (durvalumab) must 
be withheld for drug -related toxicities and severe or life -threatening AEs as per the table below.  
 
All toxicities are per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
5.0 
Guidelines for the management and dosing modifications for immune -mediated reactions, infusion -related reactions, 
and non -immune -mediated reactions for MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy are provided in the subsections 
below as follows:  
• General guidelines for toxicity management and dosing modifications (Table 5a)  
• Toxicity management and dosing modifications guidelines for specific immune -related adverse events 
(irAEs)/immune -mediated AEs (imAEs) and other irAEs/imAEs not specified (Table 5b)

to Grade 2, please discuss with Study Physician.”  
 
7.   ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
7.1   Protocol Agents  
  Investigational Agents  
The investigational agent administered in NRG -LU004, MEDI4736 (durvalumab) (NSC 
#778709), is being made available under an IND sponsored by [CONTACT_472].  
Refer to the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) investigator brochure (IB) for detailed 
pharmacologic and safety information.  
For MEDI4736 (durvalumab), determination of whether an adverse event meets 
expedited reporting criteria, see the reporting table in section 7.4  of the protocol.  
7.2      Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
7.2.1    This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 5.0 for reporting of adverse events (AEs), located on the CTEP web 
site, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm . All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0.   
 
7.2.2  Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related.  Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of unrelated, 
unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). (International Conference on Harmonisation 
[ICH], E2A, E6).  
 
For multi -modality trials, adverse event reporting encompasses all aspects of protocol 
treatment including radiation therapy, surgery, device, and drug.  
 
Due to the risk of intrauterine exposure of a fetus to potentially teratogenic agents, the 
pregnancy of a study participant must be reported via CTEP -AERS in an expedited 
manner.

NRG -LU004  63                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  Note : MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of 
any adverse event currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may 
result in events never previously associated with either agent.  
7.4     Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events  (25-NOV -2019 ) 
All adverse events (AEs) are submitted for expedited reporting protocol -specific rules evaluation 
using the Medidata Rave data management system. All AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_280546] (CTEP -AERS) to determine 
whether expedited reporting is recommended based on a set of programmed expedited reporting 
rules. AEs identified as meeting the programmed expedited reporting requirements can then be 
submitted in CTEP -AERS. A deep link in Rave will take the user directly to CTEP -AERS where 
the expedited report may be completed and submitted via CTEP -AERS.  
 
All serious adverse events that meet expedited reporting criteria defined in the reporting table 
below will be reported via the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System, CTEP -AERS accessed 
via the link in RAVE.  CTEP -AERS is also accessed via the CTEP web site, but all expedited 
reports must be initiated in RAVE ( https://eapps -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages/task?rand=1390853489613 ). 
 
Submitting a report via CTEP -AERS serves as notification to the NRG Biostatistical/Data 
Management Center and satisfies NRG requirements for expedited adverse event reporting.   
 
CTEP -AERS provides a radiation therapy -only pathway for events experienced that involve 
radiation therapy only. These events must be reported via the CTEP -AERS radiation therapy -
only pathway.  
 
In the rare event when Internet connectivity is disrupted, a [ADDRESS_342207] be made to 
CTEP as the IND sponsor for this study by [CONTACT_1381] 301 -897-7497 and to the NRG Oncology 
by [CONTACT_1555] 1 -[PHONE_5820].  An electronic report must be submitted immediately upon re -
establishment of the Internet connection.  
 
7.4.1  Expedited Reporting Methods  
• Per CTEP NCI Guidelines for Adverse Events Reporting, a CTEP -AERS [ADDRESS_342208] be followed by a complete report within 5 
days.  
• Supporting source documentation is requested by [CONTACT_280547]. Supporting source documentation should include the protocol 
number, patient ID number, and CTEP -AERS ticket number on each page, and fax 
supporting documentation to CTEP at [ADDRESS_342209] NRG Oncology at 
[PHONE_5821] for source document submission assistance.  
• In the event of site assessment disagreement with a CTEP -AERS rules assessment of 
an expedited report “NOT recommended”, based upon the protocol -specific reporting 
requirements and criteria outlined in the AE Reporting Tables, sites may by[CONTACT_261347] 
“NOT recommended” assessment; the CTEP -AERS allows submission of all reports 
regardless of the results of the assessment.  
 
NRG -LU004  65                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  Not applicable.  
 
7.4.3  Reporting to the Site IRB/REB  
Investigators will report serious adverse events to the local Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Research Ethics Board (REB) responsible for oversight of the patient according 
to institutional policy.  
 
7.4.4  Secondary Malignancy   
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A 
secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur during or subsequent to  treatment 
with an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . In addition, 
secondary malignancies following radiation therapy must be reported via CTEP -AERS. 
Three options are available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also 
be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
Second Malignancy:  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT 
a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine 
AE reporting unless otherwise specified.  
7.[ADDRESS_342210] be 
completed and submitted to CTEP.   Any pregnancy occurring in a patient or patient’s 
partner from the time of consent to [ADDRESS_342211] be 
reported and then followed for outcome.   Newborn infants should be followed until 30 
days old.   Please see the “NCI Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting 
Requirements for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs” (at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm ) for more details on 
how to report pregnancy and its outcome to CTEP.  
 
8.0       RE GISTRATION AND STUDY ENTRY PROCEDURES  (03-AUG -2020 ) 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
policy require all individuals contributing to NCI -sponsored trials to register and renew 
their registration annually.  To register, all individuals must obtain a Cancer Therapy 
Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity and Access Management (IAM) account at 
(https:// ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam ).  In addition, persons with a registration type of 
 
NRG -LU004  67                        Version Date:  November 3, [ADDRESS_342212] ing as the Site -Protocol PI (investigator listed on the IRB 
approval) , consenting/treating/drug shipment  investigator in OPEN , must be rostered at the

8.1      Cancer Trials Support Unit Registration Procedures  (13-JAN-2021 ) 
            This study is supported by [CONTACT_6818] (CTSU).    
 
8.1.1     IRB Approval  
             For CTEP and Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) studie s open to the National 
Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and NCI Community Oncology Research Program 
(NCORP) Research Bases after March 1, 2019, all U.S. -based sites must be members of 
the NCI Central Institutional Review Board (NCI CIRB). In addition, U.S. -based sites 
must accept the NCI CIRB review to activate new studies at the site after March 1, 2019. 
Local IRB review will continue to be accepted for studies that are not reviewed by [CONTACT_280549], or if the study was previously open at the site under the local IRB.  
 
 Sites must submit the Study Specific Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB 
using IRBManager to indicate their intent to open the study locally. The NCI CIRB’s 
approval of the SSW is automatically communicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office, but 
sites are required to contact [CONTACT_280550] 
[EMAIL_5423] to establish site preferences for applying NCI CIRB 
approvals across their Signatory Network. Site preferences can be set at the network or 
protocol level. Questions about establishing site preferences can be addressed to the

Other Names: IMFINZI ™ 
 
Classification : Anti-PD-L1 MAb  
 
Molecular Weight: ~ 149 kDa  
 
Mode of Action : Durvalumab  (MEDI4736) inhibits binding of programmed cell death 
ligand 1 (PD -L1) to PD -1 and CD80.  In -vitro studies demonstrate that durvalumab  
(MEDI4736) relieves PD -L1-mediated suppression of human T -cell activation.  
Durvalumab  (MEDI4736) does not trigger antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity or 
complement -dependent cytotoxicity in cell -based functional assays.  
 
Description: Durvalumab ( MEDI4736) is a  human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) 
monoclonal antibody.  
 
How Supplied: Durvalumab  (MEDI4736) is supplied by [CONTACT_38227], and distributed by 
[CONTACT_25523], CTEP/DCTD/NCI.  Durvalumab (MEDI4736)  
injection is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution for 
intravenous use.  Each vial contains 500 mg of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in 10 mL of 
solution.  Each 1 mL of solution contains 50 mg of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and is 
formulated in: L -histidine (2 mg), L -histidi ne hydrochloride monohydrate (2.7 mg), α,α -
trehalose dihydrate (104 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), and Water for Injection, USP.  
 
Preparation:  Durvalumab  (MEDI4736) solution for infusion must be diluted prior to 
administration.  To prepare the infusion solu tion add the dose volume of durvalumab  
(MEDI4736) to an  infusion bag containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or Dextrose 
 
NRG -LU004  74                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  5% in Water Injection, USP and mix by [CONTACT_280556].  The final concentration must be between 1 mg/mL to 15 mg/mL . 
 
Infusion bags must be latex -free and can be made of polypropylene, polyethylene, 
polyolefin copolymers, or polyvinyl chloride.  
 
Storage: Store intact vials between 2 -8°C (36 -46°F).  Do not freeze.  Protect from light by 
[CONTACT_280557].   
 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return durvalumab  
(MEDI4736) to between 2 -8°C and quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed 
report of the excursion (including documentation of temperature monitoring and 
duration of the excursion) to [EMAIL_087]  for determination of 
suitability.  
 
Stability: Refer to the package label for expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
 
Total in -use storage time from needle puncture of durvalumab  (MEDI4736) vial to start 
of administration should not exceed 8  hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2 -8°C 
(36-46°F).  Prior to the start of the infusion, ensure that the bag contents are at room 
temperature (approximately 25°C) to avoid an infusion reaction due to the administration 
of the solution at low temperatures.   
 
Route  of Administration:  IV infusion  
 
Method of Administration : Infuse over approximately 60 minutes using an infusion set 
containing a 0.22 or 0.2 μm in -line filter.  No incompatibilities between durvalumab  
(MEDI4736) and polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, or polyolefin 
copolymers have been observed.  Flush the IV line with a volume of IV bag diluent equal 
to the priming volu me of the infusion set used at the completion of infusion.   Do not co -
administer other drugs through the same infusion line.  
 
Patient Care Implications:  Refer to the protocol for information on evaluation and 
management of potential immune -related adverse events.

The PD -L1 protein is expressed on the  plasma membrane of a range of hematopoietic 
and solid tissue cells interacting with the PD -1 receptor present on the surface of T - 
and B -lymphocytes and some myeloid cells. PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_342214] demonstrated that PD -L1 status may be predictive of benefit from 
treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. Durval umab is a humanized monoclonal 
antibody targeting PD -1 with increased PD -L1 expression.  Tumors with high 
expression of PD -L1 show increased objective response rate and improved 
progression free and overall survival compared to low expressors. PD -L1 IHC 22C3 
is a qualitative immunohistochemical assay using Monoclonal Mouse Anti -PD-L1, 
Clone 22C3 intended for use in the detection of PD -L1 protein in formalin -fixed, 
paraffin -embedded (FFPE) non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue and gastric or 
gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma using EnVision FLEX visualization and 
performed on Autostainer Link 48. PD -L1 IHC 22C3 is indicated as an aid in 
identifying NSCLC patients for treatment with pembrolizumab.  PD -L1 protein 
expression in NSCLC is determined by [CONTACT_280558] (TPS), which 
is the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete membrane 
staining at any intensity. The specimen is considered to have PD -L1 expression if  
TPS ≥ 1% and high PD -L1 expression if TPS ≥ 50%.

The Rave Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -
AERS) integration enables evaluation of post -baseline Adverse Events (AE) entered in 
Rave to determine whether they require expedited reporting, and facilitates entry in 
CTEP -AERS for those AEs requiring expedited reporting.    
 
All AEs that occur after baseline are collected in Medidata Rave using the Adverse Event 
form, which is available for entry at each treatment or reporting period, and used to collect 
AEs that start during the period or persist from the previous reporting period. CRA will 
enter AEs that occur prior to the start of treatment on a baseline form that is not included 
in the Rave -CTEP -AERS integration. AEs that occur prior to enrollment must begin and 
 
NRG -LU004  82                        Version Date:  November 3, [ADDRESS_342220]:  
• The reporting period (course/cycle) is correct; and  
• AEs are recorded and complete (no missing fields) and the form is query free.  
 
The CRA reports AEs in Rave at the time the Investigator learns of the event. If the CRA 
modifies an AE, it must be re -submitted for rules evaluation.  
 
Upon completion of AE entry in Medidata Rave, the CRA submits the AE for rules 
evaluation by [CONTACT_278615]. Both NCI and 
protocol -specific reporting rules evaluate the AEs submitted for expedited reporting. A 
report is initiated in CTEP -AERS using information entered in Medidata Rave for AEs 
that meet reporting requirements. The CRA completes the report by [CONTACT_278616] -
AERS via a direct link on the Medidata Rave Expedited Reporting Evaluation form.  
 
In the rare occurrence, that Internet connectivity is lost , a 24-hour notification is to be 
made to CTEP by [CONTACT_1381] [ADDRESS_342221].  
 
Additional information about the CTEP -AERS integration is available on the CTSU 
website:

13.3   Data Quality Portal  (03-AUG -2020 ) 
The Data Quality Portal (DQP) provides a central location for site staff to manage 
unanswered queries and form delinquencies, monitor data quality and timeliness, generate 
reports, and review metrics.  
 
The DQP is located on the CTSU members’ website under Data Management. The Rave 
Home section displays a table providing summary counts of Total Delinquencies and Total 
Queries. DQP Queries, DQP Delinquent Forms and the DQP Reports modules are 
available to access details and reports of unanswered queries, delinquent forms, and 
timeliness reports. Review the DQP modules on a regular basis to manage specified 
queries and delinquent forms.

Note: Some Rave protocols may not have delinquent form details or reports specified on 
the DQP. A protocol must have the Calendar functionality implemented in Rave by [CONTACT_280561]. Site staff should contact [CONTACT_278625] .   
13.4    Summary of Data Submission  (25-NOV -2019 ) 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who 
will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine 
manner at scheduled times during the trial using Medidata Rave®. Additionally, certain 
adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner for more timely monitoring of 
patient safety and care. See Section 7.4  for information about expedited and routine 
reporting.   
 
Summary of All Data Submission: Refer to the protocol  specific page on the NRG 
website (www.nrgoncology.org).

14.       STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Study Design  
This is a phase I trial to assess the safety and feasibility of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) and 
RT that is split into 2 parts.  In the initial safety part, 6 patients will enroll to the ACRT + 
MEDI4736 (durvalumab) arm, with a mandatory toxicity evaluation period of [ADDRESS_342224] radiation + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) arm with 
a mandatory toxicity evaluation of [ADDRESS_342225] been assessed for toxicity, the expansion part of this study will enroll 6 
patients each to the arm(s) that is/are deemed safe.  If both arms are deemed safe, then a 
total of 12 patients will be randomized to receive ACRT + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) or 
standard radiation + MEDI4736 (durvalumab).   If only one of the two arms is deemed 
safe, then only that arm will enroll 6 additional patients.  If neither arm is deemed safe, 
then the study will not continue onto the expansion part.  
 
14.2 Study Endpoints  
14.2.1  Primary endpoint : Safety of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combination with RT  
14.2.2   Secondary endpoints  
• Feasibility of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combination with RT  
• Adverse events, as measured by [CONTACT_3989] v 5.0  
• Progression free survival, according to RECIST guidelines  
14.2.3   Exploratory endpoints  
• Progression free survival, according to irRC guidelines  
• CTC and immune parameter changes during treatment  
 
14.3 Primary Objectives Study Design  (03-AUG -2020 ) 
14.3.1  Primary Hypothesis and Endpoints  
 The primary hypothesis is that MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combination with two 
schedules of radiation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (60 Gy in 30 fractions or 60 Gy in 15 fractions)  is safe.  
14.3.2  How Primary Endpoints Will Be Analyzed   
The tolerability of this regimen is defined as having one or no safety events defined as:  
1) grade 4 -5 non -hematologic serious adverse events (SAEs) as defined in Section 7.4.2  
possibly, probably or definitely related to protocol treatment by 90 days from the start of 
concurrent therapy (start of RT) for the ACRT + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) arm and 8 
weeks from the start of concurrent therapy (start of RT) for the standard radiation + 
MEDI4736 (durvalumab) arm;  
2) any adverse events possibly, probably or definitely related to protocol treatment that 
lead to prolonged dose delays (defined as skippi[INVESTIGATOR_167846] 2 doses of MEDI4736 
(durvalumab) during the same monitoring period for each arm);  
3) permanent discontinuation of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) due to toxicity possibly, 
probably or definitely related to protocol treatment within the first 30 days of starting 
MEDI4736 (durvalumab); or  
 
NRG -LU004  85                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  4) SAEs possibly, probably or definitely related to RT (including grade 3 -4 congestive 
heart failure, pneumonitis, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction, grade 4 esophagitis, 
and any AEs that lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) that causes either an interruption or early 
termination of RT as specified in Section 6.[ADDRESS_342226] part of the study for either arm, if 0 -1 of 6 evaluable patients develop any of 
the safety events after completing RT, then the regimen will be deemed safe and that arm 
will continue to the second part of the study and enroll 6 additional evaluable patients.  
However, if 2  or more  of 6 evaluable patients develop any safety events, that arm is 
considered not safe and will not be pursued in the second part.  With a cohort of 6 
patients, the probability of the treatment  being judged to be too toxic when the true 
toxicity rate is 4 0% or higher is at least 7 7%. If the true toxicity rate is 18% or lower, the 
probability that the treatment  will be deemed to be safe is at least 70 %.   
 
If [ADDRESS_342227] experienced a safety event.   
 
The other cohort will remain open to accrual, if applicable, during this time.  If fewer  
than 4 of the 12 evaluable patients on an arm experience a safety event, then the 
treatment will be considered tolerable.  With a cohort of 12 patients, the probability of the 
treatment  being judged to be too toxic when the true toxicity rate is 4 0% or higher is at 
least 78%. If the true toxicity rate is 18% or lower, the probability that the treatment  will 
be deemed to be safe is 8 5%.  In order to proceed to a phase II trial, the treatment(s) must 
be considered both safe (as defined above) and feasible (as defined in Section 14.6.2 ). 
 
14.4 Study Monitoring of Primary Objectives  
Interim Analysis to Monitor Study Progress  
Interim reports will be prepared twice each year until the final analysis has been accepted 
for presentation or publication. In general, these reports will contain information about 
 
NRG -LU004  86                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  the accrual rate with projected completion date for the accrual phase, exclusion rates, 
pretreatment characteristics of patients accrued, and the frequency and severity of AEs.  
 
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_470] (CDUS) Version 3.0.  
Cumulative protocol - and patient -specific CDUS data will be submitted electronically to 
CTEP on a quarterly basis by [CONTACT_6798].  Reports are due January 31, April 30, 
July 31, and October 31.  Instructions for submitting data using the CDUS can be found 
on the CTEP website  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/cdus.html ). 
 
After the start of the accrual, the study team, including the study chairs, study 
statisticians, data managers and protocol administrator, and a representative from each 
participating site will hold at least monthly conference calls to review the overall conduct 
of the study lead by [CONTACT_4305]. Data on treatment dose delivery, adverse events 
reported, patient demographics and eligibility will be assembled and reviewed.  At each 
meeting, consideration is also given to the rate of accrual. Brief minutes of each meeting 
will be written by [CONTACT_280563]. The meeting minutes will be submitted to the NRG early phase protocol 
monitoring oversight committee for review.  
 
If one or both arms are to move forward to the expansion cohort based on the criteria 
stated in Section 14.3.[ADDRESS_342228].  
 
14.5 Accrual/Study Duration Considerations  
Accrual is expected to be 4 patients/month after a 3 month initial ramp -up period.  Initial 
Safety Schedules (enrollment of 6 patients/arm) is expected to close after 6 months.  
Expansion Cohorts will open, assuming ACRT + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) is shown to 
be safe and feasible, approximately 4 -6 months after closing Initial Safety Schedules (to 
allow for 8 -16 weeks of follow -up to assess prolonged dose delays as well as time for 
data collection and analysis).  It is projected to take 4 months to accrue to Randomization 
stage ( 1 month ramp -up period and 3 months accruing 4 patients/month).  This stage will 
similarly require 8 -16 weeks of follow -up to assess prolonged dose delays.  The primary 
analysis is projected to occur approximately 20 months from study activation.  
 
14.6     Secondary Endpoints  
14.6.1  Secondary Hypotheses and Endpoints :  
• MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combination with RT is feasible  
• Adverse events, as measured by [CONTACT_3989] v 5.0  
• Progression free survival  
 
14.6.[ADDRESS_342229] 
80% of the planned dose of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) therapy during the first 8 weeks 
following initial dose of MEDI4736 (durvalumab). Feasibility will only be assessed for 
 
NRG -LU004  87                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  the treatment cohort(s) that moves to the expansion phase. The observation of at least 
80% (10/12 per arm) of patients who received at least 80% of the planned dose is 
considered to be evidence that this regimen is feasible in this setting.   
 
Adverse events  
Adverse events (AE) will be evaluated using the CTCAE v 5.0.  Counts of all AEs by 
[CONTACT_280564].  Counts and frequencies will be provided for the 
worst grade AE experienced by [CONTACT_280565].  Severe AEs will be any grade [ADDRESS_342230] guidelines (as reported by [CONTACT_30107]) as 
defined in Section 4 .  Progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time from 
registration  to progressive disease or death, whichever occurs first, will be estimated 
using the Kaplan Meier method.  Plots and descriptive statistics will be provided for both 
treatment arms but no formal testing performed due to lack of statistical power.   
 
14.6.3  Exploratory Hypothes es and Endpoints  
Progression Free Survival  
Tumor measurements will be collected at baseline, the end of treatment and throughout 
follow -up in order to determine response using the irRC guidelines.  Progression free 
survival (PFS), defined as the time from registration  to progressive disease or death, 
whichever occurs first, will be estimated using the Kaplan Meier method.  Plots and 
descriptive statistics will be provided for both treatment arms but no formal testing 
performed due to lack of statistical power.   
 
 Biomarker Analysis  
 Biomarker analyses will be conducted for feasibility purposes.  There is not sufficient 
power to detect differences between arms or any prognostic ability of the biomarkers 
described.  Therefore all biomarker analyses , including the immune parameters described 
in Section 10. 4.1, will focus on descriptive statistics and change from baseline to 
subsequent collection times.  Circulating tumor cells will be collected and analyzed at the 
time of progression.  It is hypothesized that progress ed patients will have a value of green 
fluorescent proton -expressing cells per ML > 1.3 (Frick 2018, Dorsey 2015).  Therefore, 
at 2 years, an analysis will be conducted to determine if every progressed patient has a 
value > 1.3.    
  
14.6.4  Gender/Ethnicity/Race Distribution  
There will not be sufficient sample sizes to conduct any subgroup analyses based on race, 
ethnicity, and/or gender.

APPENDIX V :  CLINICAL BLOOD SAMPLE SHIPMENT PREPARATION AND 
TRANSPORTATION FOR TELOMESCAN  (25-NOV -2019 ) 
 
I. RATIONALE  
The purpose of this document is to describe the procedure for handling, packaging, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_280508], by [CONTACT_280567].  
 
1. Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC)   
A. Overview  
Currently, there is little known about the numbers, time course, and effect of therapy on 
Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in NSCLC patients.  The biospecimens collected in this 
study will allow for an assessment of (1) CTC  changes during treatment with durvalumab 
and radiotherapy and after completion of treatment , and (2) the relationship between CTC 
changes during and following treatment with radiographic tumor response and disease 
recurrence.   CTCs will be enriched from whole blood and treated with TelomeScan 
(OBP -401). TelomeScan is a genetically engineered adenovirus that replicates and 
produces GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein)  specifically  in live, cancerous cells  with high 
TERT expression. GFP expressing cells will be imaged and enumerated. The 
disappearance of CTCs / mL is an indication of disease clearance, and the reappearance 
of CTCs / mL is an indication of progressive disease or recurrence.  
B. Laboratory Testing Procedures  
Blood specimens are required for this analysis.  The procedure of blood collection for 
each patient will be as follows: Blood will be drawn into a waste tube (to avoid collecting 
skin material and potential contaminating skin stem cells) . The waste tube will either be 
discarded or used to investigate other laboratory methods involving CTC virus 
transduction . Subsequently, blood will be collected in ACD -A tubes at ambient 
temperature and placed in a n insulated tube box inside  a biohazard plastic bag and 
transported to the laboratory for processing.

1. Include all required specimen paperwork in pocket of biohazard bag.  
 
2. Check that the Specimen Transmittal (ST) Form has been completely filled out. Use NRG 
labels  for the top box (Study & Case) . 
 
3. Only send samples that have a case # assigned. If the patient does not have a case number it  
means they are not registered yet. Contact [CONTACT_280571].  
 
4. Check that all samples are labeled with the NRG Study, case number, and date of procedure.  
 
5. FFPE Specimens for Banking:  
• H&E Slide of primary tumor (can be duplicate cut slide, does not have to be diagnostic 
slide) .  
• FFPE Tissue Block of primary tumor (must be same block as H&E slide being 
submitted) . If an FNA was done we cannot accept FNA slides unless there is an FFPE 
cell block with tumor cells available. Sites are to submit one FNA H&E and matching 
FNA FFPE cell block if sufficient tumor cells are available. If there are insufficient cells 
then note this on the ST form with the H&E being submitted.  
• For sites unable to submit the complete tumor tissue block then then the following 
alternative is acceptable: Either:  
o Two unstained slides with date cut on the slides.  
o OR Two 2mm (or 3mm) punches (tumor size dependent) embedded in paraffin 
with a corresponding H&E. (Punch kits available from NRGBB -SF upon request). 
If sites are unable to embed the punches they may send the punches to the 
biobank to be embedded.  
 
NRG -LU004  106                        Version Date:  November 3, [ADDRESS_342252] label the unstained slides with Study, Case#, accession number, block 
number and date the slides were cut. Slides must be shipped to NRGBB -SF within 
2 business days from when they were cut .  
 
Please make sure all FFPE specimens are labeled with Study#, Case#, Specimen accession 
number and block ID. Redact or cover up the patient name [CONTACT_280591]. Do not add paper sticky 
labels over this information. It is the Biospecimen Banks SOP to remove all sticky labels on 
slides before adding an NRGBB label.  
 
All FFPE submission must include the H&E slide that matches the samples. We cannot accept 
FFPE submissions without the H&E slide. If submitting embedded punches, an H&E from the 
punch block must be included along with the original block H&E with the area punched marked 
on the original H&E.  
 
If patients consent to banking DO NOT ship us FFPE specimens with a return request. We  
cannot accept or bank samples that we cannot keep. Always send what can be banked  
(duplicate H&Es, Blocks or punches). We can punch and return blocks if noted in the protocol.  
You may indicate that you want us to punch and return the block on the ST form and you can  
include a return request form and return airbill with the submission. Punch kits can be  
requested from us by [CONTACT_6968] ([EMAIL_5473]) if sites wish to punch the block themselves.  
 
Slides should be shipped in plastic slide holder/slide box. Place a small wad of padding in top  
of the container. If you can hear slides shaking it is likely that they will break during shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
DO NOT ship slides in cardboard slide flats or single unit plastic slide holders.  
 
FFPE Blocks can be shipped in a plastic block holder or wrapped with paper or placed in a  
paper envelope, and placed in a cardboard box with padding. Do not wrap blocks with bubble  
wrap or gauze. Place padding in top of container so that if you shake the container the blocks  
are not shaking. If you can hear blocks shaking they may break during shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. During warm  
weather months the use of cold packs is highly recommended to prevent wax from melting.  
 
Slides, Blocks, or Plugs can be shipped ambient or with a cold pack either by [CONTACT_280572] (USPS) to the USPS address ([ZIP_CODE]) or by [CONTACT_280573]  
([ZIP_CODE]). Do NOT ship on Dry Ice. Do not ship in a flat or padded envelope without a protective  
box/container inside, they can be crushed, even if in a plastic slide holder.

APPENDIX VI II:  CANCER IMMUNE MONITORING AND ANALYSIS CENTER 
(CIMAC ) BIOMARKER TESTING  (03-NOV -2021 ) 
 
1.   CyTOF   
A. Overview  
Assess ment of  changes in immune cell diversity over time is required to quantify the 
immune cell subsets in circulation , with  each subset given in percentages rather than 
absolute amount or levels. The dynamic changes in immune cell subsets throughout 
therapy may tell us whether specific subsets of T cells are being expanded, such as 
memory T cells or activated T cells. We hypothesize that expansion of specific subsets of 
cells will correlate most strongly with the disease outcomes of patients. The immune cell 
subsets that change with the different radiation schedules with immunotherapy could also 
relate to enhanced toxicities, which will be monitor ed very closely as the primary 
endpoint of this phase I study.  
B. Laboratory Testing Procedures  
Assessing multiple cell types simultaneously in a high dimensional manner requires 
multiparametric technology that could simultaneously assess all of th e parameters on a 
single cell. Using Time of Flight Mass Cytometry (CyTOF), antibodies conjugated with 
rare transition element isotopes that differ by [CONTACT_280579] a TOF mass cytometer. The theoretical maximum of parameters is 
100, but the most common use s have only interrogated up to [ADDRESS_342260] fluorescence -based flow 
cytometry. Using MatLab analysis, one can resolve cell identify ( e.g., CD8, CD4, Treg, 
MDSC, NK, B cells) and expression level s of various activating, inhibitory, or signaling 
molecules on these cells.  
 
2.   TC R Sequencing  
A. Overview  
 Lymphocyte maturation is a process marked by [CONTACT_280580], as well as 
discrete and regulated molecular events. The first event in the process of antitumor 
cytotoxic T -cell response is antigen capture by [CONTACT_488] -presenting cells (APCs). The 
antigens are processed and subsequently presented on HLA class I molecules to CD8+ T 
cells to activate the T -cell response against these specific antigens. Following activation, 
effector CD8+ T cells infiltrate into tumor tissues, releasing cytotoxic agent upon 
recognition of cancer cells through the interaction between TCR and its cognate antigen 
bound to HLA class I.  
 
The diversity of T cells is determined by [CONTACT_280581]. The complimentary determi ning 
region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR chain is the most variable portion of the TCR and is critical 
for MHC –peptide complex recognition. The range of individual TCR -bearing T -cell 
clones that comprises the repertoire specific for a particular antigenic MHC –peptide com -
plex varies substantially in terms of TCR frequency and diversity. A consequence of this 
specificity is that the TCR  CDR3  sequence can be used as a "molecular tag" to identify 
each T -cell clone. Recently presented data have indicated that that large clonal T -cell 
expansions were associated with inferior PFS and OS in B -cell lymphoma . 
 
NRG -LU004  115                        Version Date:  November 3, 2021  B. Laboratory Testing Procedures  
CIMAC will designate a laboratory to perform TCR sequencing .* 
*Note:  at CIMAC discretion, if sufficient material is available.  
 
3.   Cyt okine Analysis  
A. Overview  
This e xploratory analysis will identify the quantity and types of cytokines released in the 
blood during and after therapy. Cytokines and chemokines mediate the cross talk between 
cells of the immune system, both locally and systemically. Certain inflammatory 
mediators such as interferons act as surrogates of the activation of the immune system, 
and also signal the effectiveness of cancer therapy. Certain markers are also 
immunosuppressive  (e.g., TGF beta), so the effectiveness of the immune system response 
is a balance of immunostimulating and immunosuppressive cytokines. Radiation therapy 
could also illicit profound cytokine release and the amount could have relationship to 
both the radiation dose and fractionation schemes, and the synergistic interaction with 
immunotherapy. We hypothesize that proinflammatory cytokines could be release 
differentially depending on the radiation schedule, which could further be accentuated by 
[CONTACT_179475]. Inflammatory mediators could also contribute to immune related adverse 
events that may be exacerbated by [CONTACT_69159] . Therefore , we may also see early 
surrogates of toxicity by [CONTACT_280582].  
B. Laboratory Testing Procedures  
Multiplex Immunoassay using the OLink Technology. Plasma (prepared from blood 
collected in green -top sodium -heparin tubes) will be collected  and sent to the NRGBB -
Columbus for processing, then sent to the CIMAC laboratory at the Icahn School of 
Medicine at Mount Sinai in [LOCATION_001]  to conduct the OLink assay . Samples will be  
collected at baseline, Day [ADDRESS_342261] treatment, and at 3 months from the start of 
durvalumab (i.e. cycle 4).  Olink assay has large dynamic range and each assay has 
internal controls that will ensure the robustness of the test.  
 
4.   ELISA/Grand Serology  
A. Overview  
B. One approach to test whether tumors become more immunogenic as a result of 
immunotherapy is to measure naturally occurring antibodies in patient serum or plasma. 
Autologous serotypi[INVESTIGATOR_280525] a growing list of immunogenic human cancer 
antigens1, including mutational, overexpressed, oncogenic viral, differentiation, and 
cancer -testis antigens. These antigens, though usually intracellular, reflect the immune 
system’s capacity to detect abnormalities associated with neoplasia. The presence of 
antibodies to tumor antigens can be used as a marker of tumor presence or progression, 
but may also help generate T cell responses via immune complexes with cognate antigen. 
In some cases, such as the cancer/testis antigen NY -ESO -1, serum antibodies are 
associated with spontaneous T cell responses in peripheral blood. We propose to test the 
hypotheses that immunotherapy leads to induction or increase in immunity to locally 
expressed antigens by [CONTACT_280583] -post treatment, and that the 
serological repertoire in patients may be useful as a prognostic or predictive tool. 
Laboratory Testing Procedures  
 
NRG -LU004  116                        Version Date:  November 3, [ADDRESS_342262] for potential for antigen spreading, i.e., development of 
seroreactivity to antigens unrelated to immunogen es, which is a useful measurement to 
assess in immunotherapy.  
 
5.   Ci rculating Tumor DNA (ctDNA)  
A. Overview  
The detectability of any strand of DNA bearing cancer specific mutations can be 
quantified as well as the number of molecules per mL of blood. Any molecule of cancer 
specific DNA (or ctDNA) can be determined as minimal residual disease, and the 
disappearance of the ctDNA in the blood is an indication of disease clearance. The level 
may also indicate disease burden as well.  
B. Laboratory Testing Procedures  
Ultradeep allelic sequencing of ctDNA – to be performed by [CONTACT_280584] . 
 
6. PD-L1 (SP263) Immunohistochemistry (IHC)  
a. Overview  
PD-L1 is an informative immunotherapy biomarker: Aberrant expression of PD -L1 on 
tumor and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment impedes anti -tumor immunity, 
allowing tumors to grow and metastasize.   SP263 tumor cell staining quickly calculates 
PD-L1 positivity for user -defined regions of interest.  
b. Laboratory Testing Procedures  
PD-L1 (SP263) IHC will be done using optional tissue biospecimens  for cases that were 
stained using the D ako 22C3 (the Dako 22C3 will be used in case(s) without the PD -L1 
22C3 assay already performed , Multiplex IHC , and i f sufficient tissue/DNA from tissue 
remains  – TCRseq ).

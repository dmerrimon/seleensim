  1.[ADDRESS_803005] Randomized Controlled Clinical Study to 
Investigate the Safety and Effectiveness of RECELL for Repi[INVESTIGATOR_606153].  CTP00 9 
Phase of Study  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_606154]® Autologous Cell Harvesting Device  is intended for use at the 
patient’s point -of-care for the safe and rapid preparation of Spray- On Skin™ Cells 
from a small sample  of a patient’s own skin. The cell suspension prepared using 
the RECELL System is suitable for application to a prepared treatment area for 
repi[INVESTIGATOR_606155].  
Primary Objective  To evaluate the application of Spray -On Skin™ Cells, prepared using the 
RECELL® Device, for safe and effective repi[INVESTIGATOR_606156].  
Study Population  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_606157] 23 subjects . This study utilizes an 
adaptive design with an interim analysis planned for the purposes of sample size 
re-estimation ( to achieve adequate conditional power). The re will be a  maximum 
of [ADDRESS_803006] meet the same eligibility criteria , will 
undergo the same study procedures and follow -up assessment s as the pi[INVESTIGATOR_606158]; however, data from the rol l-in cohort of subjects will be analyzed 
separately from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_106136].  A maximum of 35 subjects  total r oll-in cohort 
subjects (including those  randomized  prior to Rev 3) are anticipated in addition to 
the planned pi[INVESTIGATOR_606159].  Subjects in the roll- in cohort  may not re -enroll 
in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_106136].  
 
There will be a  maximum of 81 subjects  from both cohorts .  
Number of Trial Centers  The study will be executed  at no more than 15 centers  in the [LOCATION_002] . 
Clinical 
Justification/Clinical 
Benefit  The RECELL® Autologous Cell Harvesting Device has been safely and effectively 
used to prepare and apply cell suspension that includes pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517] -producing cells 
(melanocytes) for treatment of burn wounds. Patients without func tional 
melanocytes and who are candidates for application of skin cells to depi[INVESTIGATOR_606160].  
Investigational Treatment  Skin cell suspension at 1:20 expansion ratio (donor area  : recipi[INVESTIGATOR_606161]), prepared 
using the RECELL System, will be applied to an ablated (de -epi[INVESTIGATOR_129091]) area of 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_371], followed by [CONTACT_606189] -UVB.   
Control  Each subject will serve as their own Control, with a depi[INVESTIGATOR_606162] -UVB as the investigational 
treatment area.  

  
  Study Design  This is a prospective blinded randomized within -subject controlled study to 
evaluate the clinical performance of RECELL for repi[INVESTIGATOR_606163], 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_606164] [ADDRESS_803007]-treatment. Acute healing, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and compliance 
with phototherapy will be evaluated. Treatment -related and serious adverse events 
will be documented throughout the duration of the s tudy.  For all study subjects and 
visits, study areas will be documented using standardized digital photography.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_606165] (i.e., Central Review Committee, CRC)  to decrease variability.  In addition to the 
CRC, an assessment of pi[INVESTIGATOR_606166] 
(VASI) will be performed  by [CONTACT_606190] . To assess 
durability of responding RECELL -treated study areas at Week 52, the investigator 
and the CRC will confirm that ≥ 80% of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_606167]’s Week 24 photograph . 
 
Patient reported outcomes will be captured using the Vitiligo Noticeability Scale (VNS), Patient Global Impression of Change -Vitiligo (PaGIC -V), and a subject 
global treatment success assessment.   
 
After completion of the Week 24 (non-responders)  or Week 52  (responders) visit, 
the subject may be given the option for RECELL treatment of their depi[INVESTIGATOR_606168](s).  
Primary Effectiveness

areas  
5. CRC and investigator assessment of pi[INVESTIGATOR_606172] 36 and 52  
6. Investigator study  area VASI scores, change from baseline  
7. Investigator assessment of color matching for the study areas

Study -specific procedure 
highlights  • Two depi[INVESTIGATOR_606181] (A and B) . 
• Randomization to assign area A or B to RECELL will be performed in the EDC . 
• Donor skin will be harvested under local anesthetic sufficient to prepare suspension for both the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_606182].  
• The RECELL -assign ed study area will be ablated  to a sufficient depth to  
remove the epi[INVESTIGATOR_606183]. 
• Spray -On Skin™ Cells  will be applied to the RECELL -assigned study area 
using a 1:20 expansion ratio.  
• Standardized dressings will be applied  to the RECELL -treated study area and 
donor site.  
•  NB-UVB phototherapy  will 
commence on both study areas after dressings are no longer in place.   

  
  Screening Committee (SC)  Post-consent and p rior to randomization , investigational  sites must submit 
photographic evidence (with date stamp or other evid ence of date of image 
acquisition) of stable vitiligo for each subject  that in cludes:  
1) Current photos  of the subject’s depi[INVESTIGATOR_606184]   
2) Current photos  of the subject’s dorsal hands displaying all fingertips 
obtained during screening   
3) Historic photos ≥ [ADDRESS_803012]’s depi[INVESTIGATOR_606185] a minimum of [ADDRESS_803013] the photographic evidence 
outlined above  in addition to other relevant medical history reviewed by a minimum 
of 3 committee members. Two (2) of [ADDRESS_803014] concur the photographs are 
of stable vitiligo  prior  to the investigational site proceeding with randomization and 
treatment.  The SC wil l be blinded to which investigational site the photogr aphs 
originated from.  
Central Review Committee  
(CRC)  Three independent board -certified dermatologists (Central Review Committee, 
CRC) will be selected based on specific selection criteria for the purpose of providing blinded adjudication to determine whether successful  repi[INVESTIGATOR_606186]  (≥ 80%) have been achieved  and if not
, then to determine 
categorization of r epi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. The CRC will be blinded to the study site, 
treatment assignment, and the investigator ’s determination of repi[INVESTIGATOR_606187]. The adjudicated results will be used in the primary analysis.  
 
The CRC will be governed under a charter that will be approved by [CONTACT_942], and that will contain the guidance and rules under which they will review and adjudicate data. Assessments of repi[INVESTIGATOR_50147] [ADDRESS_803015]- treatment 
(relative to baseline) will be assessed by [CONTACT_606192] C RC. If two C RC 
members agree, adjudication of that subject ’s timepoint will be deemed complete. 
If there are any discordant cases (i.e., agreement not achieved between two C RC 
members), the committee will review the case together  with the majority ruling (2/3 
CRC members in agreement) serving as the final adjudication . The  CRC members 
will record their review independently. Panel assessments will be conducted  
consistent with consensus guidance published by [CONTACT_606193] (VGICG) for the  evaluation  of patients with  vitiligo using a 
reference atlas developed by [CONTACT_606194][INVESTIGATOR_606188].  

  
  Statistical considerations  The sample size for this trial was determined based on the primary effectiveness 
endpoint of responders at 24 weeks. The trial is designed to tes t if RECELL 
treatment using an expansion ratio of 1:20 is superior to  Control.  An alpha level of 
0.025 is utilized for hypothesis testing. The trial will incorporate an unblinded 
interim analysis for purposes of sample size re -estimation after approximately half 
the planned subjects reach 24 weeks. The interim analysis will be conducted 
according to the promising zone method of Mehta and Pocock (2011), allowing for up to twice the original planned sample size.  
 Assuming 5% responders  in Control and 60 % responders for RECELL, 20 subjects 
yields 90% power, one -sided 0. 025 level of significance  to demonstrate RECELL 
superiority versus Control . This assumes a 10% superiority margin relative to 
Control .  
 Anticipating 10% los t to follow -up, [ADDRESS_803016] already been 
enrolled.

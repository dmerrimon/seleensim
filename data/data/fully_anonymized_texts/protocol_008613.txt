Protocol FLU GEN -H3N2 -V005 Amendment 2 (dated 10 May2021) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_1246574] also been made as needed.  
 
1. Exclusion Criteria: (Sections revised: Section 4.2 – Subject Exclusion Criteria) 
Individuals with Grade 2 elevated cholesterol may be enrolled at the discretion of the 
Investigator, if their overall lipid panel does not indicate an increased risk for 
cardiovascular disease.  
Rationale:  Language removed from the protocol since lipid panel is not collected in 
the study.  
2. Exclusion Criteria : (Sections revised: Section 4.2 – Subject Exclusion Criteria) 
Donation of blood or blood product of at least approximately 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731] (~470mL) within  
60 days of IP receipt or planned within 3 months (84 days) after IP administration.  
Rationale : Minor edit to the section.  
3. Vial Weighing : (Sections revised: Section 5.1 – Study Vaccine, Section 5.7.1 – 
Investigational Vaccine )  
Devices will be weighed pre and post fill to allow calculation of dose filled into devices.  
Rationale: Language removed from the protocol as devices will not be weighed.  
4. Prior and Concomitant Therapy : (Section 5.9 Prior and Concomitant Therapy ) 
Subjects may receive a vacc ine that is licensed or under an EUA if it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_890427]. The preference, 
when possible, is to avoid such treatment during the [ADDRESS_1246575] -visit 01.  
Rationale: Added language to provide clarification regarding vaccine administration 
during the study participation.  
5. Schedule of Events : (Section revised : Section 6.1.1 Table 2: - Schedule of Events – IP 
Administration )  
Updated Schedule of events  
Rationale: Update to the schedule of events  table to remove V01 hematology and 
chemistry (Foot note remains to provide additional clarification). Removal of vial 
weights.  
6. Screening Period : (Section revised: Section 6.1.2 Screening Period)   
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
3 CONFIDENTIAL  Subjects will be re -confirmed for eligibility on Day 1 (V01) prior to dose 
administration. Chemistry and hematology at V00 will serve as eligibility and baseline 
values unless collected more than 28 days prior to V01. In such case the lab tests will 
be redone to establi sh baseline only.  
Rationale: Added language to provide clarification regarding safety lab collection.  
7. Urine Samples : (Section revised: Section [IP_ADDRESS] Urine Samples)   
Results are obtained by [CONTACT_890456].  
If dipstick urinalysis is Abnormal/positive for protein, blood, nitrite and/or leukocyte 
esterase, a microscopic examination for white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells 
(RBC), bacteria, casts, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_890428]. Crystals, casts, and 
bacteria will only be reported if present.  
Rationale: Added language to provide clarification regarding urine sample collection.  
8. Bioan alysis: (Section revised: Section 6.2.2 Bioanalysis)   
Blood samples for determination of the concentration of analytes specified in Appendix 
3 will be analyzed by a qualified vendor under the responsibility of the Sponsor, using 
validated analytical methods.  
Rationale: Language previously stated “Blood and uri ne samples…” however 
urinalysis is being performed by [CONTACT_890457].  
9. IP Doses and Via l Weights : (Section revised: Section 6.2.6 IP Doses and Vial 
Weights)  The weight of each M2SR vaccine vial will be collected prior to and after 
filling of delivery devices. The weights will be recorded at the time point specified in 
the Schedules of Events – IP Administration ( Table 2). A calculation of the original vial 
weight minus the emptied vial weight will indicate the weight of dose that was fi lled 
into the device and will be used to determine volume dispensed. The unblinded 
pharmacist will maintain the weight logs in a secure and confidential manner until 
after database lock to maintain the blind. The weight logs will be periodically reviewed 
by [CONTACT_890458]. After database lock, the weights will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Rationale: Language removed from the protocol as devices will not be weighed.

4 CONFIDENTIAL  SYNOPSIS  
Name [CONTACT_790]/Company:  
FluGen Corporation, [ADDRESS_1246576]:  
Sing2016 M2SR Vaccine  
Name [CONTACT_3261]:  
H3N2 Sing2016 (A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016) M2SR monovalent influenza vaccine  
Protocol Number: FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  Phase: 1b Country:  US 
Title of Study:  
Phase 1b clinical study to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of the H3N2 Sing2016 
(A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016) M2SR monovalent influenza vaccine in  adults ages 50 to 85 
years old.  
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first subject  enrolled: June [ADDRESS_1246577]  completed: December 2021  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of monovalent Sing2016 H3N2 
M2SR influenza vaccine delivered intranasally to healthy subjects 50 to 85 years of age  
Secondary:  
• To evaluate safety of inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine ( QIV) when 
administered at least 28  days after receipt of investigational M2SR vaccine  
• To assess the immunogenicity (serum and mucosal antibody responses) of one 
administration of 109 fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50) Sing2016 
M2SR vaccine  
Additional exploratory objectives may also be evaluated.  
Methodology:  This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 1b study evaluating 
the safety and immunogenicity of the Sing2016 M2SR H3N2 influenza vaccine delivered 
intranasally to a healthy adult population aged 50 to 85 years. Eligible subjects will be randomized 
in a 2:[ADDRESS_1246578] 28 days later. Study enroll ment will begin with a group of adults 50 -
64 years of age (Cohort 1, n=15) and will be followed by a lead -in group of subjects age 65 -85 
years of age (Cohort 2, n=15), followed by [CONTACT_890459], ages 65 -
85 years of age  (Cohor t 3, n=90). Subjects will be enrolled into cohorts successively.  
Subject safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_890460] ( eDiary ) data and assessments during study visits. Study visits will 
preferably be co nducted  on-site in the clinic; however, due to the coronavirus disease of 
2019 ( Covid -19) pandemic, phone contact s to report solicited and /or unsolicited AEs 
and/or sample collection via a drive -through or remote lab oratory will be allowed during 
the study, at the discretion of the Investigator . Prior to enrollment of Cohorts  2 and 3 , a 
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
5 CONFIDENTIAL  blinded review of available safety data from the prior cohort (s) will be conducted by [CONTACT_890461] ( PI) after subjects have completed at least 
[ADDRESS_1246579] ( IP) treatment. If halting rules are met or if a safety 
concern requiring further assessment is identified , by [CONTACT_890462],  then the review 
will be escalated to a  Safety Review Committee (SRC), comprised at a minimum of two 
independent physicians experienced in vaccine research and a biostatistician.  In addition, 
there will be [ADDRESS_1246580] one round of review towards 
establishing a cleaned and QCed dataset . The purpose  of these scheduled meetings is 
informational and not for gating decisions that determine progress to each successive 
cohort.  
The study design is shown in the figure below:

6 CONFIDENTIAL  * Subjects w ill receive a licensed QIV based upon avail ability  of a US recomm ended  and age -appropriate 
product that will be identified  and provided by [CONTACT_890463] [ADDRESS_1246581] signed an informed consent, they will be screened and assessed for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria including a test to evaluate serum antibodies to the Sing2016 
hemagglutinin ( HA) antigen. Within each cohort , subjects will be stratified based on a prescreening 
antibody titer to HA (by [CONTACT_33818] [HAI] assay) from Sing2016 H3N2 influenza 
virus  that is performed under a separate , site-specific protocol . That is, for each cohort ~50 % of 
subjects will have an HAI titer of <[ADDRESS_1246582] an HAI titer ≤320.  
Eligible subjects will have a baseline blood draw, will be randomized, and will then receive either 
active Sing2016 M2SR vaccine or placebo on Day [ADDRESS_1246583] symptoms in an eDiary, the results of which will be monitored daily by [CONTACT_890464] ( AEs). Subjects will return to the investigational site for 
follow-up on Days 8 and 29 (Visits 02 and 03, respectively). After at least 28 days (up to 42 days 
for Cohort  3) following administration of Sing2016 M2SR, licensed QIV will be administered at 
Visit  04. The interval between IP and QIV administration may be longer than [ADDRESS_1246584] 2021, based on the availability in the US of the 
licensed vaccine for the 2021 -2022 Northern Hemisphere influenza seaso n. QIV administrations 
may commence in September 2021 (as soon as the vaccine becomes available) and must be 
completed no later than early November 2021.  
The final study visit (Visit 05) for each study subject will occur [ADDRESS_1246585] ration. Serum samples for analysis of anti -HA antibody titers and nasal swabs will be 
collected as indicated in the Schedules of Events.  
Serious adverse events (S AEs) occurring at any time during the study will be recorded. 
Administration site and solicit ed AEs will be recorded through 7 days after IP vaccination ( V02). 
Unsolicited AEs will be recorded from time of consent  through 28 days after both M2SR and QIV 
vaccinations .  
While safety and tolerability are the primary objectives, this clinical study is  also designed to assess 
the immune response to one dose of the investigational vaccine and after subsequent immunization 
with QIV. Immunogenicity will be assessed by [CONTACT_890465]/or 
HAI assay  and mucosal antibody titers by [CONTACT_6428] . Additional immune parameters may be assessed 
including T cell responses . Subjects will be screened to determine HA titers against the target 
component (A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016 [H3N2]) with the intent to enroll subjects with 
low titers ( ≤320 HAI titer s). 
Number of subject s (planned): Approximately 120 evaluable subjects  
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: Participating subjects will be healthy male and non -
pregnant/lactating female s who are 50-[ADDRESS_1246586] acute or chronic physical or mental health

[ADDRESS_1246601] seasonal influenza strains. The 
vaccine virus does not express an essential viral protein (influe nza M2), restricting it to a single 
replication cycle in the host. The initial (prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) investigational monovalent agent, 
designated as Bris10 M2SR vaccine, was designed to elicit an immune response to the vaccine 
virus, influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2). Available data from Phase [ADDRESS_1246602] a highly drifted 
H3N2 influenza chall enge agent among subjects who demonstrated a serum immune response 
following vaccination. An updated vaccine, Sing2016 M2SR, encodes for the hemagglutinin 
(HA) and neuraminidase ( NA) of A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016, the H3N2 strain 
recommended for the [ADDRESS_1246603] shown that 1 or 2 doses of up to 109 fifty 
percent tissue culture infective dose ( TCID 50) Sing2016 M2SR vaccine given at a 28 -day interval 
were also safe and immunogenic. Ultimately , the vaccine development program aims to evaluate 
a quadrivalent (QIV) M2SR vaccine product containing two influ enza A subtypes (H1N1 -like 
and H3N2 -like viruses) and two influenza B types.  
1.2. Background Information  
1.2.1.  Influenza  
Influenza viruses typi[INVESTIGATOR_890430] ( US) annually from the late fall 
through early spring. Although most persons who become infected will recover without 
sequelae, influenza can cause serious illness and death, particularly among persons age 
≥ 65 years, children <  2 years, and individuals with u nderlying medical conditions that confer 
an increased risk of influenza -related complications ( Grohskopf 2013 ). Over the past [ADDRESS_1246604] ranged from 12,000 to 61,000 annually, with 140,000 
to 810,000  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_705529] ( CDC 2 020).  
Annual influenza vaccination has long remained the primary means of preventing influenza 
infection and its complications and has been consistently recommended by  [CONTACT_705598] 60 years. Although routine vaccination was initially recommended only for 
high-risk populations in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACI P) have recommended since 2010 that all 
persons aged ≥  [ADDRESS_1246605] contraindications should be vaccinated ( Grohskopf 
2015 ). Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at high risk of serious 
compl ications from influenza, such as those 65 years of age and older. While vaccination with 
licensed vaccine can continue to be offered throughout the influenza season, the CDC 
recommends that individuals be vaccinated by [CONTACT_890468]  (Grohskopf 2019 ).  
Recent evaluations conducted by a US government -supported network of large clinics (US 
Flu-VE Network; Treanor 2012 ), have demonstrated an overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) of at 
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
[ADDRESS_1246606] 60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53 -66) for prevention of laboratory -confirmed, 
medically attended influenza illness due to any influenza virus, even in years in which there was 
a good match between vaccine and circulating strains ( Treanor 2012 ). VE estimates in the US 
among individuals age ≥  [ADDRESS_1246607] been consistently lower than in younger age groups, 
which is consistent with the well -documented reduction in immunogenicity of influenza vaccine 
in older adults ( Osterholm 2012 ). VE has been  as low as 9% in healthy older adults and even 
lower in older adults with underlying chronic diseases who are at risk for disability, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and death. For H3N2 influenza strains, the VE in the > 65-year-old age group 
was between 10-20% for the last five influenza seasons. Given the substantial and further 
increasing resource allocations to the US influenza vaccination programs, the continued search 
for more effective vaccines to  further improve the population -level impact of the program ‒ and 
particularly among older adults and others at high risk of serious influenza complications ‒ 
remains a critically important public health challenge.  
1.2.2.  Current Influenza Vaccines  
Currently avai lable inactivated and recombinant influenza vaccines primarily aim to induce 
neutralizing antibodies that recognize the virus envelope protein HA. These antibodies can 
provide effective immunity, but they depend on a close match between the vaccine immunog en 
and circulating viruses. Such vaccines are therefore relatively ineffective against newly 
emerging viruses or viruses that have drifted away from the vaccine strain. Conventional egg -
derived inactivated vaccines, which currently comprise approximately 9 0% of the US market, 
generally provide limited or no broadly cross -reactive (heterosubtypic) immunity needed to 
protect against divergent strains. Currently available trivalent (TIV) or quadrivalent (QIV) 
preparations provide the HA antigen and either none  or limited and non -standardized amounts 
NA antigen. Moreover, at least one HA component of these vaccines must often be updated due 
to accumulated point mutations in the HA protein that allow the viruses to evade the human 
immune response. In addition, while mucosal and T cell immune responses have been associated 
with a reduction in influenza illness severity in subjects seronegative for influenza virus -specific 
antibody, these immune responses are generally not elicited following vaccination with 
convent ional licensed inactivated vaccines  (Wilkinson 2012 ; Clements 1986 , Treanor 1999 ; 
Belshe 2000 ).  
1.2.3.  Live attenuated vaccines  
In contr ast to conventional inactivated and recombinant vaccines, live influenza virus vaccines 
are generally believed to offer broad -spectrum immune responses because they induce diverse 
types of adaptive responses, including serum antibodies, mucosal immunity, a nd induction of 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which target conserved virus epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] ( Clements 1986 ; Tamura 2005 ; 
Zhu 2010 ; Lanthier 2011 ; Ambrose 2012 ; Jin 2015 ). Only one such live vaccine, (FluMist®), 
which has been attenuated empi[INVESTIGATOR_705530] -adaptation, has been approved in the US, a nd is 
presently indicated only for persons [ADDRESS_1246608] vaccine are not fully 
understood; serum antibodies, mucosal antibodies, and influenza -specific T c ells may play a 
role. Agreement has not yet been reached on a surrogate of efficacy  for FluMist . Accumulating 
data also indicate that pre -existing cross -reactive immunity present in most adults limits live, 
attenuated vaccine virus replication, which in tu rn reduces a consistently effective immune

19 CONFIDENTIAL  response and poor vaccine efficacy relative to inactivated influenza vaccine ( IIV) (Eick 2009 ; 
Ohmit 2006 ; Wang 2009 ; Monto 2009 ). This in part explains the observation that young, 
seronegative children are the population in which FluMist vaccination is typi[INVESTIGATOR_890431].  
1.2.4.  FluGen’s H3N2 (A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016) M2SR vaccine  
FluGen is deve lopi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a novel live virus vaccine platform known as “M2SR” to address the need 
for more effective influenza vaccines that will provide more consistent and broad -spectrum 
immunity for adults, and especially the elderly. The product is a live virus vaccine f or intranasal 
administration that has been shown to provide protection against multiple influenza A subtypes 
in animal models (see below). The vaccine is a replication -defective recombinant influenza virus 
that does not express the essential M2 protein (an d hence, the derivation of the “M2SR” naming 
convention [Single Replication phenotype due to lack of M2]). The M2SR vaccine virus 
backbone is comprised of (1) five of the six internal proteins of the donor virus Influenza 
A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8), a strain  that has been used for decades in traditional inactivated 
influenza vaccine manufacturing; (2) the sixth internal protein, M2, which is acquired from the 
cell substrate used to grow the vaccine virus, M2 Vero cells, which stably express and supply 
M2 prot ein for vaccine virus growth; and (3) the two influenza virus surface protein antigens, 
HA and NA, which can be derived from any selected Type A influenza strain. The resulting 
vaccine virus can infect normal cells in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_890432] a wild -type influenza virus, thereby [CONTACT_890469]. However, because the M2SR genome does not encode for M2 protein, no 
viral progeny is subsequently produced after the initial (s ingle round) infection, such that no cell -
to-cell spread or subsequent shedding of virus occurs.  
Sing2016 M2SR is a recombinant, monovalent influenza A virus that contains a n Influenza 
A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8)  backbone with nine amino acid changes distributed over five genes 
(PB1 , PB2, PA, NP and NS1) that facilitate growth in the production cell line, M2VeroA. The 
mechanism of attenuation (deletion of the M2 gene) is not affected. The Sing2016 M2SR also 
provid es the HA and NA components from A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/[ADDRESS_1246609] 
Time in Human (FTIH ) Phase 1 dose escalation study in healthy adults, a Phase 2a challenge 
study in healthy adults, a Phase 1b dose escalation study in healthy adults, and a recently 
completed Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity study in adolescents (9 -17 years old). Details o n 
design and conduct of these studies are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB). All studies 
are complete , and data are unblinded for the Phase 1a FTIH, Phase [ADDRESS_1246610] been 
enrolled in these studies to date.  
In the Phase 1 FTIH study, 72 adults (24 subjects per dose level) received a single dose of Bris 10 
M2SR at levels of 106, 107 or 108 TCID 50 and  24 subjects received saline  placebo . In the 
challenge study, 52 adults received a single 108 TCID 50 dose of Bris10 M2SR  and 56 subjects 
received saline , with 48 M2SR and 51 placebo subjects  subsequently chall enged with a drifted

20 CONFIDENTIAL  H3N2 strain. In the Phase 1b dose escalation study, 206 (of 250 targeted) adults received two 
doses of either placebo (~20% of enrollment) or Bris10 M2SR at 108 TCID 50 (~20%), Sing2016 
M2SR in amounts of 108, 108.5, or 109 TCID 50 (~60% of enrollment; 165 active treatment 
subjects total). In the Phase 1 study, 43 adolescents (out of 50 planned) received one intranasal 
administration of [ADDRESS_1246611] dose of Bris10 M2SR tested (108 TCID 50) with no serious adverse events ( SAEs ) or 
adverse events ( AEs) or other observations that would halt these studies. In addition, in the 
challenge study, 48 of 52 subjects who received the live, single -replication Bris10 M2SR virus 
(single dose of 108 TCID 50) were subsequently challenged with a live, replicating influenza virus. 
A portion of those individuals experienced infection and symptoms after challenge, consistent 
with influenza (i.e., nasal edema, nasal dryness, nasal pain/irritation, nasal congestion, 
rhinorrhea), but at a frequency less than that observed among in dividuals in the same study who 
did not receive vaccine prior to challenge. Unblinded safety data from the FTIH, challenge and 
dose escalation studies show one and two doses of the vaccine to be well tolerated, with related 
AEs that were  generally mild or moderate in severity. No additional safety concerns were 
identified after challenge in the Phase 2a study. Reviews of unblinded safety data from the 
studies in adult populations have not identified any safety concerns. Of the [ADDRESS_1246612] drift 
viruses. In addition, while a strong relationship has been established between pre -existing T  cell 
immunity and illne ss severity, inactivated vaccines do not elicit cellular immune responses and 
generally do not provide broadly cross -reactive (heterosubtypic) immunity needed to protect 
against divergent strains. Moreover, mucosal immune responses have also been associate d with 
a reduction in influenza illness in experimental challenge models and with live influenza 
vaccines; however, mucosal antibody responses are not elicited by [CONTACT_890470]. For example, the severity of the [ADDRESS_1246613] 13%. 
In the 2018 -2019 influenza season in the US, the inactivated vaccines displayed a VE estimate 
of only 9% (www.cdc.gov) against H3N2, again  due to mismatch between the vaccine strain and 
the circulating seasonal H3N2 virus that had accumulated antigenic changes (i.e., “drifted”). 
These recent examples indicate the need for an influenza vaccine that can protect against 
seasonal influenza drift  variants.  
In contrast to currently licensed influenza vaccines, pre -clinical testing of M2SR vaccine has 
shown induction of broadly reactive immune responses against multiple influenza subtypes and 
heterosubtypic protection in animal models, including dem onstration of robust systemic, cellular 
and mucosal immunogenicity, even in the presence of pre -existing anti -influenza immunity. In

[ADDRESS_1246614] a 
drifted H3N2 challenge virus, A /Alaska/140/2015, a virus belonging to clade 3c.2a1 .  
Human clinical trial participants who received Bris10 M2SR (108 TCID 50 dose) in the Phase 1a 
FTIH and Phase 2a studies also demonstrated broad -spectrum immune responses. In the FTIH 
study, vaccine induc ed serum and mucosal antibody responses were cross -reactive against 
multiple antigenically different H3N2 viruses including recent strains that belonged to the same 
clade (3c.3b) as the challenge virus used in the Phase 2a study.  
Results from the Phase 2a  challenge study showed that a single dose of [ADDRESS_1246615] challenge in subjects who responded to vaccination by [CONTACT_91030] 
a serum humoral immune response. Subjects who demonstrated any increase from baseline in 
serum antibo dy response (~50% of the M2SR cohort) by [CONTACT_363947] ( MN) to the 
intranasal M2SR vaccine had lower viral load and influenza -like symptoms after challenge than 
placebo subjects. These results suggested that if higher dose levels of M2SR could furthe r 
enhance the serum immune response to influenza, then efficacy could be provided for in a higher 
proportion of M2SR recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Thus, a subsequent Phase 1b study evaluated one and two 
administrations of investigational M2SR at dose levels up to 10 -fold greater than the dose 
employed in the Phase 2a challenge study .  
The follow -on Phase 1b study was conducted with 206 healthy adults ages 18 –49 years to  
evaluate whether an increased dose or a two -dose regimen could increase the proportion of 
subjects who respond to the M2SR vaccine, as demonstrated with serum, mucosal , and cellular 
immune responses. An early review of the group unblinded data show ed that the higher doses 
(up to 109 TCID 50) and two doses administered with a 28 -day interval were safe and well -
tolerated ; no SAEs were reported and no halting rules were met. Preliminary immunology data 
demonstrate d that a single administration of the higher do se indeed resulted in a significantly 
higher rate of response to the M2SR vaccine.  Subjects  who received the 109 TCID 50 dose of 
M2SR dose demonstrated 71% seroconversion rate (≥4 -fold)  for serum hemagglutinin ( HA) 
antibody  in contrast to 28% seroconversion  among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] 108 TCID 50 (dose used in the 
phase 2a challenge study) .

25 CONFIDENTIAL  3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1. Overview of Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 1b study evaluating the safety and 
immunogenicity of the Sing2016 M2SR H3N2 influenza vacci ne delivered intranasally to a 
healthy adult population age 50 to 85 years. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_1246622] 28 days later. A group of adults 50 -64 years of age (Cohort 1, n=15) will 
be followed by a lead-in group of subjects age 65 -85 years of age (Cohort 2, n=15), followed by 
[CONTACT_890459], ages 65 -85 years of age  (Cohort 3, n=90)  (Figure 
1). Subjects will be enrolled into cohorts successively.  
Subject safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_890474]. Study visits will preferably be conducted on -site in the 
clinic; however, due to the coronavirus disease of 2019 ( Covid -19) pandemic, phone contacts to 
report solicited and unsolicited AEs and/or sample collection via a drive -through or remote 
laboratory will be allowed during the study, at the discretion of the Investigator . Prior  to 
enrollment of Cohorts 2 and 3 , a blinded review of available safety data from the prior cohort 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_890475] ( PI) after subjects have 
completed at least 7 days after IP treatment . If halting rules are met or if a safety concern 
requiring further assessment is identified , by [CONTACT_890462], then the review will be 
escalated to a Safety Review Committee (SRC), comprised at a minimum of two independent 
physicians experienced in vaccine research and a biostatistician.  
In addition, there will be [ADDRESS_1246623] one round of review towards establishing a 
cleaned and QCed dataset. The purpose of these scheduled meetings is informational and not 
for gating decisions that determine progress to each successive cohort.  
An overview of the planned Study Cohorts is presented in Table 1.

27 CONFIDENTIAL  investigational site for follow -up on Days 8  and 29 (Visits 02  and 03, respectively ). After at least 
28 days (and up to 42 days for Cohort 3) following administration of Sing2016 M2SR, licensed 
QIV will be administered at Visit [ADDRESS_1246627] 2021,  based on the 
availability of the licensed vaccine  for the 2021 -2022 Northern Hemisphere influenza season . 
QIV administrations may commence in September 2021 (as soon as the vaccine becomes 
available) and must be completed no later than early November 2021 . 
The final study visit (V isit 05) for each study subject will occur 28 days after licensed QIV 
administration . Serum samples for analysis of anti -HA antibody titers and nasal swabs will be 
collected has indicated in Table 2 (IP administration) and Table 3 (QIV administration) .  
SAEs occurring at any time during the study will be recorded. Administration site and solicited 
AEs will be recorded through 7 days after IP vaccination (Day 8) . Unsolicited AEs will be 
recorded from time of consent through 28 days after both M2SR and QIV vaccinations .  
While s afety and tolerability are the primary objectives, this clinical study is also designed to 
assess the immune response to one dose of the investigational vaccine and after subsequent 
immunization with QIV. Immunogenicity will be assessed by [CONTACT_890479]/or HAI assay  and mucosal antibody titers by [CONTACT_6428] . Additional immune 
parameters will be assessed including T-cell responses . Subjects will be screened to determine 
HA titers against the target component (A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016 [H3N2]) with the 
intent to enroll subjects with low titers ( ≤320 HAI titer).  
3.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled with approximately 80 subjects receiving study 
Sing2016 M2SR vaccine and 40 subjects receiving placebo.

mucosal and systemic immune responses by [CONTACT_40689].  
3.6.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
In a Phase 1b dose -ranging  study, the highest dose of Sing2016 M2SR vaccine studied 
(109 TCID 50) was well tolerated. No SAEs were reported and no halting rules were met. A single 
administration of this dose resulted in a significantly higher rate of immunological response to 
the M2 SR vaccine compared with lower doses.  
3.6.3.  Rationale for Placebo Control  
Placebo control will be used to establish the frequency and magnitude of changes in laboratory  
and clinical endpoints that may occur in the absence of active vaccination  and will serve as  a 
comparator for vaccine safety . 
3.6.4.  Rationale for Randomization and Blinding  
Randomi zation will be  used to avoid bi as in the  assignment of subjects to in crease the likelihood 
that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographic and baseline characteristics) are 
evenly balanced across treatment groups,  and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons 
across treatment groups.  
Blinded treatment will be  used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of  
clinical endpoints. Only the pharmacis t and/or their designee preparing the treatment, the 
unblinded monitor and the unblinded statistician or computer programmer  who prepares the 
randomization list are unblinded with respect to treatment.  Unblinded individuals will be 
restricted from participating in other study procedures the interpretation of which could be 
impacted by [CONTACT_705622] , e.g., subject assessments . 
3.6.5.  Rationale for Administration of Licensed Influenza Vaccine  
The CDC recommends that all persons without  contraindications should be vaccinated with any 
licensed age -appropriate influenza vaccine  each year, and vaccination is particularly important 
for people who are at high risk of serious complications from influenza, such as those 6 5 years 
of age and older. Sing2016 M2SR  is an investigational  recombinant, monovalent influenza A 
virus  vaccine.  To satisfy the CDC recommendations for annual licensed flu vaccination, 
particularly in elderly persons, age-appropriate  (for subjects 50 -64 ve rsus those ≥65 years of 
age) licensed influenza vaccines will be administered at least 28 days after IP administration in 
this study.

33 CONFIDENTIAL  5. TREATMENTS  
5.1. Study Vaccine  
Sing2016 M2SR Vaccine:  The IP is termed Sing2016 M2SR and is a recombinant, monovalent 
influen za A virus that was initially generated by [CONTACT_2363] a plasmid rescue system. The vaccine 
virus backbone is composed of the 6 internal protein genes of the donor virus PR8 similar to 
those used in the prototype Bris10 M2SR vaccine used in the FTIH trial  but w ith nine amino 
acid changes distributed over five genes (PB1, PB2, PA, NP and NS1) that facilitate growth in 
the production cell line, M2VeroA. The mechanism of attenuation (deletion of the M2 gene) is 
not affected. Since the virus does not express an esse ntial viral protein (influenza M2), it is 
restricted to a single replication cycle in the host.  The Sing2016 M2SR vaccine  also encodes the 
viral antigens HA and NA from Influenza A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/[ADDRESS_1246644] prior to dose 
administration. The contents will be drawn into two 1 mL disposable polypropylene syringes 
each fitted with a mucosal atomization device (MAD300; Tele flex, Salt Lake City, Utah, US) 
for intranasal delivery. The barrel of the syringe will be wrapped with a label to mask any 
coloration of the contents that might otherwise unblind the site staff or subject.  
5.2. Placebo Administered in the Study  
The reference product (placebo) is a sterile, physiological saline suitable for intranasal delivery. 
The placebo will be provided as a liquid and in single -use vials. The placebo will be drawn into 
two 1 mL disposable syringes (~50% volume each) that are fitted with a Teleflex MAD30 [ADDRESS_1246645] 28 days after IP administration . Subjects will be 
in a seated position and receive an injection of the licensed vaccine delivered to the deltoid 
muscle.  
The QIV will be supplied to the site s from a distributor engaged by [CONTACT_1034].

Manufacturing, packaging, and labeling of Sing2016 M2SR vaccine is under the responsibility 
of the Sponsor.  
The Sing2016 M2SR for this study was manufa ctured using master virus stocks and working 
cell bank at Ology Bioservices (Alachua, [LOCATION_012], US) under current Good Manufacturing 
Practice in a liquid formulation. The Sing2016 M2SR vaccine will be provided frozen and in 
single -use cryovials at 2.2e9 TCI D50/mL. The vaccine is  suspended in SPG -NaCl buffer 
comprised of [ADDRESS_1246646] is a 2 mL cryovial with a threaded cap closure. The 
vaccine will be labeled according to local law and regulatory requirements. Each vial label will 
include the following information: product name, item and lot numbers, date of manu facture, 
storage condition, volume, vial number, manufacturer, and “Caution: New Drug – Limited by 
[CONTACT_336820].”  
The vaccine vials will be packed into multi -vial boxes. Each box will be labeled with the 
following information: produc t name, item and lot numbers, storage condition, vial number 
range and volume, manufacturer and “Caution: New Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_336821].”  
5.4.2.  Placebo  
The placebo is a commercially available physiological saline that will be purchase d by [CONTACT_890481] . The 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, US  pharmacopeia 
(USP), is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, isotonic solution of sodium chloride and water for injection. It

35 CONFIDENTIAL  5.5. Storage and Drug Accountability  
The Investigator (or designee) is responsible for the safe storage of all study treatments  assigned 
to the clinical site, in a locked, secure storage facility with access limited to those individuals 
authorized to dispense the study drugs and maintained within the appropriate ranges of 
temperature. All study drugs must be stored as specified at  delivery and in the original packaging. 
Instructions for the storage and handling of the study drugs will also be provided to the clinical 
site. 
5.5.1.  Study Vaccine  
The M2SR vaccine will be delivered frozen and must be stored frozen at < -65°C in the provided 
multi-vial boxes. Each vaccine vial is a single -use vial. Once the vial contents have been thawed, 
the vial must be stored at 2 -8°C prior to use in vaccine administration. The thawed vial contents 
will remain stable in the Sponsor -identified cryovials, for up to [ADDRESS_1246648] 
that has been thawed and held at 2 -8°C for longer than [ADDRESS_1246649] Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
and a certificate of destruction, or equivalent should be filed on site and provided to the Sponsor 
for internal filing.  
Investigational product must be stored under temperature -controlled and monitored conditions. 
The site will also maintain a temperature log record of the relevant equipment for IP storage. 
Should an excursion in storage conditions occur, t he clinical site must not further dispense the 
affected study vaccine until after notification and consultation with the Sponsor.  
The Investigator is responsible throughout the study for ensuring inventory and account record 
of all study drugs received at the clinical site. All drug accountability records must be stored in 
the site file and must be readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_68601]/or auditor, and 
open to regulatory inspections at any time.  
As misallocations of study drug may have a detrimental effect on subjects’ safety and/or the 
study drug ’s efficacy and are a potential source of bias, utmost care should be taken to correctly 
dispense the study drugs as assigned by [CONTACT_546947].  
The vaccine and placebo should be di spensed under the supervision of the Investigator, a 
qualified member of the clinical staff, or by a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic pharmacist or designee. The 
pharmacist or designee must maintain accurate records demonstrating date and amount  of 
vaccine and the placebo supplied to whom and by [INVESTIGATOR_412937]. The investigational vaccine and placebo 
will be supplied only to subjects participating in the study.  
The Sponsor’s designated study monitor will periodically check the supplies of vaccine and the 
placebo held by [CONTACT_890482]/designee to ensure accountability and appropriate 
storage conditions of all vaccine and placebo used.  
Unused vaccine and placebo must be available for verification by [CONTACT_890483] -
site monitoring visits. Any discrepancies be tween returned and expected returned vaccine and 
placebo should be explained and documented.  
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
36 CONFIDENTIAL  After the database has been locked and all on -site drug accountability has been completed by [CONTACT_36102], any unused vaccine (including neat and diluted remnants) may be returned to the 
Sponsor or destroyed at the clinical site with the Sponsor’s written permission (in this case a 
certificate of destruction or equivalent will be provided and filed in the electronic Trial Master 
File [eTMF]).  
Hazardous materials such  as used ampoules, needles, syringes and vials containing hazardous 
liquids, should be disposed of immediately in a safe manner and therefore will not be retained 
for drug accountability purposes.  
5.5.2.  Placebo  
Each placebo cartridge is a single -use container. The solution will be stored at USP controlled 
room temperature (20 – 25°C) prior to use in treatment administration. The contents may be used 
up to the date of expi[INVESTIGATOR_705539].  
Procedures for handling and storage of the commercially a vailable placebo are detailed on the 
product -specific labels.  
5.5.3.  Licensed QIV  
The licensed QIV is supplied as vials or prefilled syringe s without needles. The QIV will be 
stored refrigerated at 2-8°C. Do not freeze this vaccine. If product is frozen it must b e discarded. 
The contents may be used up to the date of expi[INVESTIGATOR_705539].  
5.6. Blinding  
The blind will be maintained during this trial, including use of the following measures:  
1. All subjects, whether receiving Sing2016 M2SR vaccine or placeb o, will undergo the same 
procedures, i.e., administration, AE assessment, blood collections, nasal swabs, etc.  
2. The unblinded pharmacist or designee will prepare doses (active and placebo), fill delivery 
devices and apply an opaque label to the device barre l to obscure any coloration of the 
contents.  
3. The unblinded site staff and unblinded study monitor will agree to maintain the blind by [CONTACT_890484] (active or placebo) to any blinded clinic staff including the 
Investigator and to study  subjects. Furthermore, the unblinded individuals will be restricted 
from participating in other study procedures the interpretation of which could be impacted 
by [CONTACT_705622], such as evaluation of AEs.  
4. If any blinded investigational site staff learn of treatment assignments, a record of the event 
will be maintained, and the Investigator  will be informed. The Investigator  will consult with 
FluGen on how to preserve the blind.  
5. Labs supplied with subject samples for analyses will be blinded to tre atment a ssignment.  
Except for  the unblinded statistician  or computer programmer  who generates the randomization 
list, the unblinded pharmacist(s) or their designee(s) who prepare the study product for 
administration and the unblinded study monitor who may observe the study product preparation 
and performs IP accountability, all subjects, the Investigator, statistical programmers and all

37 CONFIDENTIAL  clinical site staff will be blinded to IP treatment (vaccine or placebo). All clinic staff who may 
be involved in making a ssessments of safety (including local reactions) will be blinded to 
treatment. Should a blinded monitor observe study product preparation, precautions must be 
taken to maintain the blind.  
Masking of the IP (vaccine or placebo) will be described in the Phar macy Manual.  
The randomization schedule will be inaccessible to the Investigator or to the blinded study team 
(monitors and/or FluGen team) during the study. After the final study visit  is complete for all 
subjects, after database lock, and after reconcil iation with pharmacy and site records, the 
randomization code will be provided to the Study Statistician to enable data analysis by [CONTACT_429].  
The unblinded Statistician will provide the randomization list to the unblinded pharmacist or 
their designee. This list will be used to prepare study product dosages and in the event of an 
emergency code break (see below).  
In the event of a medical emergency wherein knowledge of the IP treatment assignment will 
influence the subject's care, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_890434], at the discretion of the PI. The unblinded pharmacist or their designee will use the IP 
treatment assignment code to break the blind for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_705540]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_890435], and no later than [ADDRESS_1246650]’s paper source. Subjects who are 
unblinded for any reason during their participation in the study will not be replaced and will be 
withdrawn immediately from the study; however, all attemp ts will be made to collect safety data 
through [ADDRESS_1246651] -dose of the vaccine/placebo. In the event of a request to break a treatment 
code, the study monitor will be notified within 24 hours and the rationale for breaking the code 
will be documented.

47 CONFIDENTIAL  6.2.3.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored regularly from informed consent u ntil Visit 05 (28 days after  
QIV administration ). At regular intervals during the study, subjects will be asked non -leading 
questions to determine the occurrence of any AEs. All AEs reported  spontaneously during  the 
study will be recorded as well. Solicited and unsolicited signs and symptoms will be reported as 
AEs after review by [CONTACT_18370], either separately using the corresponding 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activit ies (MedDRA) terminology of the sign or symptom 
or combined using the appropriate term. For example, a subject who reported concurrent cough, 
runny nose, and sneezing assessed by [CONTACT_890490] a s a syndromic diagnosis (URI), with the severity based on the most severe 
AE/symptom. Therefore, as a secondary presentation, subjects with 3 or more concurrent 
unrelated AEs of cough, runny nose/rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat, itchy throat, itchy eyes,  
congestion, nasal irritation, hoarseness, headache, body aches/myalgia, tiredness/fatigue, 
malaise, and fever will have those AEs grouped as URI.  
For detailed definitions and reporting procedures of AEs, see Section  9. 
6.2.4.  Electronic Diary 
Subjects will be required to complete a reactogenicity eDiary through an application installed on 
the subject’s own personal device. Site will train the subject on the ap plication during Visit 01. 
All subjects will be asked to monitor and record local reactions, systemic events  including 
temperature , and antipyretic medication usage for [ADDRESS_1246669]’s experience at that time. Data on local 
reactions and systemic events reported in the reactogenicity eDiary will be transferred 
electronically to a third -party vendor, where they will be available for review by [CONTACT_10670] s 
via an internet -based portal  or reports extracted from the portal . 
At specified intervals, these data will be retrieved electronically to the Sponsor for analysis and 
reporting. These data will be reported in the database but do not need to be reported separately 
by [CONTACT_890491].

FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
[ADDRESS_1246683] administered a m edicinal 
(investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE do es not  necessarily have a causal 
relationsh ip with the  treatment. An  AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unint ended sign 
(including  an abnormal finding), symptom, or  disease temporally associated with the  use of a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, and whether related to that medicinal 
(investigational or non-investigational) product. 
This in cludes any occurrence that is n ew in on set or aggravated in s everity or frequency from 
the baseline condition, or  abnormal result of  diagnostic  procedures, including clinical laboratory 
test abnormalities. 
AEs will be monito red from the time of consent  until Visit 03 (Day 2 8 after the IP dose 
administration) and from Visit 04 until Visit  05 (Day 28 after the QIV dose administration) . SAEs 
or medically attended  events will be  documented from the time of consent until Visit 05.  
 
Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that meets any of the following conditions:  
− results in death; 
− is life-threatening, i.e., the subject was at risk of  death at the time of the event (e.g., 
ventricular fibrillation and anaphylaxis). The  term do es not refer to an event whi ch 
hypothetically might h ave caused death if it were more severe. 
− requires inp atient hospit alization or  prolongation of  existing  inpatient hospit alization: 
o Hospit alization refers to an overnight admission into hospit al for the purpose of 
investigating and/or  treating the AE. Hospit alization for an elective procedure, or 
routin ely scheduled treatment for a pre-existing  condition th at has not wo rsened, 
is not an SAE. 
− results in p ersistent or signi ficant dis ability/incapacity, i.e., causing subst antial disruption 
of the subject’s ability to condu ct normal life; 
− is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
− is medically significant, i.e., may not be  immediately life-threatening or result in d eath 
or hospit alization but m ay jeopardize the subject’s health or  may require intervention to 
prevent one of the above outcomes. Examples of such events are intensive  treatment in 
an emergency room or  at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or  
convulsions th at do not result in hospit alization or d evelopm ent of  drug dependency or 
drug abuse. 
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
56 CONFIDENTIAL  Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event 
An AE is consid ered unl isted if the nature or severity is not consist ent with the  applicable p roduct 
reference safety information (FluGen  IB). 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
A S[LOCATION_003]R is an unexpected serious adverse reaction to the IP.  
The Sponsor is to determine if the event is unexpected or not and if unexpected  and to report the 
S[LOCATION_003]R to the Lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_383094]. The Lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_705551](s) to the cen tral IRB. For 
death and life -threatening cases, reporting should be done within [ADDRESS_1246684] to be 
reported within 15 days.  
9.2. Intens ity of  Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_705640] ( Appendix 2  for vital signs and systemic AE assessment; Appendix 4  for laboratory AE 
assessment) . For events  not included in the protocol -defined grading system, then the following 
guidelines will be used to quantify intensity.  
Mild : events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities.  
Moderate : events res ult in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
Severe : events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Life threatening : any adverse drug experience that places the subject  or subject, in the view of 
the Investigator , at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not 
include a reaction t hat had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
interm ittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
9.3. Causal ity Assessment  
The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to test article (vaccine or placebo) is part of 
the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining wha t is or is not reported in the 
study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be 
reported. All AEs must have their relationship to study product assessed using the terms related 
or not related. In a clinical tr ial, the study product must always be suspect. To help assess, the 
following guidelines are used.  
Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the AE. Reasonable 
possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
product and the AE. 
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
57 CONFIDENTIAL  Not Related  – The AE is not related to the study product if there is evidence that clearly indicates 
an alternative explanation. If  the subject has not received the study product, the timing of the 
exposure to the study product and the onset of the AE are not reasonably related in time, or other 
facts, evidence or arguments exist that strongly suggest an alternative explanation, then the AE 
is not related.  
9.4. Outcome 
The outcome of each AE must be  rated as follow s: 
− Recovered/resolved; 
− Recovering/resolvi ng; 
− Not recovered/not resolved; 
− Recovered with s equelae/resolved with s equelae; 
− Fatal; 
− Unknown.  
9.5. Recording of Adverse Events  
All (S)AEs o ccurring during the clinical inv estigation must be  documented in the  source 
documents and eCRF . 
Whenever possibl e, diagnos es should be  given when signs and symptoms  are due to a common 
etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be  reported 
as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”). Investigators must record their opi[INVESTIGATOR_890448] (S)AE to the  study drugs in the  EDC  System. All m easures required for (S)AE 
management must be  recorded in the  source documents and reported according to Sponso r’s 
instructions.  
All AEs o ccurring at any time during the study (including  the in-person f ollow-up period) will 
be follow ed by [CONTACT_368697] s atisfactory resolution (e.g., value back to baseline v alue) 
or stabilization or  until final database lock. If necessary, to obtain addition al information to 
ensure safety of the  subject, addition al blood and urine samples may be taken at the discretion 
of the Investigator. Certain lon g-term AEs related to th erapy cannot be  followed until resolution 
within  the setting of this stu dy. In these cases, follow -up will be  the responsibili ty of the treating 
physician. 
9.6. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor for 
Pharmacovigilance  
All SAEs, ind ependent of the circumst ances or suspected cause, must be  recorded  on a Serious 
Adverse Event Form by [CONTACT_705641] 24 hours of  
knowl edge of the event. The SAE may be initially reported by [CONTACT_890499] ([EMAIL_13520]) within  24 hours of knowledge of the event.   
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0)

Upon  notif ication,  the Medical Monitor will evaluate the SAE report(s) within [ADDRESS_1246686]’s subs equent course must be submitt ed to FluGen and 
IRB (as applicable)  until the  event has subsid ed or, in case of permanent imp airment, until the  
condition st abilizes. 
9.7. Pregn ancy 
All initial reports of pregnancy in subj ects or in partners of male subjects must be reported to the  
Sponso r by [CONTACT_13658] 24 hours of  his/h er knowl edge of the event. This is done by 
[CONTACT_705642] ([EMAIL_13520]). A ny subject who  becomes pregnant du ring 
the study must be  prompt ly withd rawn from the  study (Code of Federal Regulations [ CFR]  
Section 8 ). 
The Investigator will contact [CONTACT_705643] -up and will 
provid e the pregnancy outcome  to the Sponsor. Abno rmal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., 
spont aneous or induced abortion, stil lbirth, neonatal death, congenital abnormality, birth defect) 
are considered SAEs and must  be reported using  the Serious Ad verse Event Form. 
9.8. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Competent 
Authorities/ Institutional Review Boards  
Adverse events reporting, in cluding  S[LOCATION_003]Rs, will be  carried out in accordance with applicable 
local regulations. 
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
[ADDRESS_1246687] of expedited reporting. The Sponsor and Investigator shall  
ensure that all relevant information about a S[LOCATION_003]R that is fatal or life -threatening is reported to 
the relevant competent authorit ies and the site IRB within 7 days after knowledge by [CONTACT_890501] a case, and that relevant follow -up information is communicated within an additional 
8 days, or according to the IRB’s required time frame . All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported to the 
relevant competent authorities and IRB within 15 days after knowledge by [CONTACT_63404] 
a case.  FluGen will provide Investigator s with all details of all SAEs reported to regulatory 
authorities.  
9.9. Medical Monitor  
The Medical Monitor is an independen t clinician ( i.e., not directly employed by [CONTACT_890502]) responsible for safety oversight of the study. He/she should have no apparent conflict 
of interest and cannot be under the supervision of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_890449] s or research staff.  
The Medical Monitor will oversee  interventions, interactions, data matching, data collection and 
data analysis, review the clinical monitoring plan, review SAE and S[LOCATION_003]R reports ( Section 9.6), 
review AEs which may prompt a study halt ( Section  7.3), participate in the SRC  (Section 9.10), 
participate in decisions regarding emergency unblinding ( Section  5.6), participate in review of 
Grade 3  and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, and review summary AE data prior to final 
database lock. The Medical Monitor is responsible to promptly report his/her observations to the 
IRB or o ther designated official. The Medical Monitor has the authority to stop the study , remove 
individual human subjects from a research protocol if needed  and take any steps necessary to 
protect the safety and well -being of the subjects until the IRB can asses s the monitor’s report. 
The Medical Monitor will also participate via phone in site training and will be available to 
answer questions related to study eligibility and safety for the duration of the study  and may 
discuss the research protocol with Investig ators. 
9.10. Safety Review Committee  
Formal s afety oversight will be under the direction of a n SRC , which is composed of an 
independent group of experts including two clinicians and a statistician who will be available to 
review blinded safety data, as needed. The SRC will monitor subject safety and advise the 
Sponsor. SRC members will be separate and i ndependent of study personnel participating in this 
study and should not have scientific, financial or other conflict of interest related to the study .  
The SRC will operate under the rules and procedures of a Sponsor -approved charter.  
In addition, there will be [ADDRESS_1246688] one round of review towards establishing a 
cleaned and QCed dataset. The purpose of these scheduled meetings is informational and not 
for gating decisions that determine progress to each successive cohort.  
 
For informational safety  reviews  and if study halting rules are met , the SRC will be provided  
applicable data including, but not limited to, enrollment, demo graphic, dosing, laboratory and 
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
60 CONFIDENTIAL  safety data, as defined in the protocol and the SRC charter. The SRC may receive data in 
aggregate and presented by [CONTACT_1570], but without the treatment group identified. The SRC 
may review aggregate safety data for in creased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse 
reactions. The SRC may be unblinded to study treatment, as needed, to assess safety issues. As 
an outcome of each review/meeting, the SRC will advise the Sponsor of its findings and make 
recommendatio ns with respect to continuation of the study.  
Throughout the study, the SRC will be convened if halting rules are met. The SRC also may be 
convened at the request of the Investigator, Medical Monitor, Sponsor or any SRC member, if 
they have cause for conce rn regarding subject safety.  The SRC can recommend study enrollment 
and vaccinations be stopped if AEs that meet the halting criteria are reported or for any 
overriding safety concern. Further details regarding composition and operation of the SRC are 
provided in the SRC Charter.  
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0)

participation. They will be  informed that their participation in the  study is volunt ary and th at 
they may withd raw from the  study at any time with no  reason given and without p enalty or loss 
of benefits to whi ch they would oth erwise be entitled. On ly subj ects who are fully able to 
understand the  risks, benefits, and pot ential AEs of  the stu dy, and who provide  their consent 
volunt arily will be  enrolled in the  study. 
10.2. Regulat ory Ethics Compliance  
10.2.1.  Investigator Responsibilities 
The Investigator(s) should be  qualified by [CONTACT_8640], t raining, and experience to assume 
responsibili ty for the proper condu ct of the study, should m eet all the  qualifications sp ecified by 
[CONTACT_1214], and should p rovide  evidence of su ch qu alifications 
through up-to-date curriculum  vitae or other relevant documentation requested by [CONTACT_13099] r, 
the IRB, or the regulatory authorities. 
The Investigator is responsible  for ensuring that the clinical study is performed in accordance 
with the  protocol, current International Council for Harmoni sation (ICH) guidelines on Good 
Clinical Practice ( GCP), and applicable regulatory and country-specific requirements. 
Good Clinical Practice is an int ernational ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, 
conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve  the participation of hum an subj ects. 
Compli ance with this st andard provides public  assurance that the rights, s afety, and well-being 
of study subjects are protected, consist ent with the  principles originating from the  Declaration of  
Helsinki (1964 and revisions ), and th at the clinical study data are credible. 
10.2.2.  Institutional Review Board  
An IRB should s afeguard the  rights, s afety, and w ell-being of all stu dy subjects. Special attention 
should be  paid to studi es that may include vulnerable subjects. 
Before the start of the study, the Sponsor  (or Investigator  where required) will p rovide the  IRB 
with current and compl ete copi[INVESTIGATOR_705554]: 
• final protocol and, if  applicable, amendments; 
• Sponso r-approved ICF (and any updates or any other written materials to be 
provided to the  subjects); 
• Subject recruiting materials; 
• IB (or equivalent information)  and addenda; 
• available safety information; 
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0)

participation in the  study, if applicable; 
• Investigator’s current curriculum vit ae or other documentation evidencing 
qualifications (unless not required, as documented by [CONTACT_1201]); 
• Clinical trial agreement;  
• any other documents th at the IRB may require to fulfill its obli gation. 
This stu dy will be  undertaken only after the IRB has given full w ritten approval of the  final 
protocol and amendments (if any), the ICF(s) and upd ates (if any), applicable recruiting 
materials, and any other written information to be  provided to the  subjects, and the  Sponsor  has 
received a copy of this approval. This approval letter must  be dated and must clearly identify the 
IRB and the  documents b eing approved. 
During the study, the  Sponsor  (or Investigator  where required) will s end the  following 
documents and upd ates to the  IRB for its review and approval, where appropriate: 
• protocol amendments;  
• revision(s) to the ICF and any other written materials to be provided to the subjects;  
• new or revised subject recruiting materials approved by [CONTACT_1034];  
• revisions to compensation for study -related injuries or payment to subjects for  
participation in the study;  
• IB addenda or new edition(s);  
• summaries of the status of the study at intervals stipulated in guidelines of the IRB 
(at least annually);  
• reports of AEs that are serious, unlisted, and associated with the IP;  
• new information tha t may adversely affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct 
of the study;  
• deviations from or changes to the protocol to eliminate immediate hazards to the 
subjects;  
• report of death of any subjects under the Investigator’s care;  
• notification if a new I nvestigator is responsible for the study at the clinical site;  
• any other requirements of the IRB.  
For all protocol amendments (excluding  the ones that are purely administ rative, with no 
consequences for subjects, data or study condu ct), the amendment and applicable ICF revisions 
must be  submi tted prompt ly to the  IRB for review and approval before impl ementation of  the 
change(s), except wh en necessary to elimin ate immediate hazard to the  study subjects. If a 
deviation from or  a change to the  protocol was implemented to elimin ate an imm ediate hazard 
to stu dy subjects, then the  implemented deviation or change, the  reasons for it, and, if  
appropriate, the protocol amendment sh ould be submitt ed to the  IRB as soon as possibl e. 
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
63 CONFIDENTIAL  The Sponsor  (or Investigator  will notify the IRB about the study compl etion within 90 d ays after 
the end of  the study (defined as last subject  last visit [ LPLV]). 
10.2.3.  Informed Consent 
Each subj ect must  give written consent according to local requirements after the nature of the 
study has been fully explained. The  consent form must be  signed before performance of any 
study-related activity. The consent form that is us ed must be approved by [CONTACT_890503]. The informed consent should be  in accordance with the  principles that 
originated in the  Declaration of  Helsinki, current ICH and G CP guidelines, applicable regulatory 
requirements, and Sponsor poli cy. 
Before enrollment in the  study, the Investigator or an authorized member of the clinical staff 
must explain to pot ential subj ects the  aims, m ethods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards of  the study, and any discomfort participation in the  study may entail. Subjects 
will be  informed that their participation is volunt ary and that they may refuse to participate or 
withd raw consent to p articipate at any time, without p enalty or loss of  benefits to wh ich the  
subject was entitled. Finally, they will be  told th at the Investigator will m aintain a subject 
identification register for the purposes of long-term follow -up if  needed and that their records 
may be accessed by [CONTACT_21652], National Institutes of Health ( NIH) National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) representative as part of its human subject protection 
oversight activities  and authorized Sponsor  staff without viol ating the confidentiality of the 
subject, to the  extent permitted by [CONTACT_6983](s) or regulations.  By [CONTACT_890504], if needed. 
The language about the  study used in the  oral and written information, in cluding  the ICF, should 
be non-technical and practical and should  be understandable to the  subject. The subject will be  
given sufficient time  to read the  ICF and the  opportunity to ask qu estions.  After this explanation 
and b efore entry into the  study, consent should be  appropriately recorded by [CONTACT_566970]'s personally dated signature. After having obtained consent, a copy of the ICF must be 
given to the  subject. 
The collection and processing  of personal data from subj ects enrolled in the study will be limit ed 
to those  data that are necessary to inv estigate the safety, quality, and utili ty of the IP used in the  
study. 
These data must be  collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality 
and compliance with applicable data privacy protection l aws and regulations. App ropriate 
technical and organizational measures to p rotect the personal data against un authorized 
disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss or  alteration must be 
put in pl ace. Sponsor  personn el whose responsibiliti es require access to p ersonal data need to 
agree to keep the  identity of the stu dy subjects confidential. 
The informed consent obtained from the  subjects includes explicit consent for the p rocessing of 
personal data and for the Investigator to allow di rect access to subjects’ original medical records 
for study-related monito ring, audit, IRB review, and regulatory inspection. T his consent also 
addresses the transfer of the data to oth er entities and to oth er countries.

[ADDRESS_1246690] be  provided to the  Sponsor  or his d esignee. When the  
change(s) involv es only logistic or administ rative aspects of the study, the IRB only needs to be  
notified. 
11.2. Subject Ident ification, Enrollment , and Screen ing Logs 
The Investigator agrees to compl ete a subject identification and enrollment log to permit easy 
identification of  each subj ect during and after the study. This do cument will be reviewed by [CONTACT_705648]. 
The subject identification and enrollment log will be  treated as confidential and will be filed by 
[CONTACT_705649]. To ensure subject confidentiality, no copi[INVESTIGATOR_705555]. All 
reports and communi cations related to the  study will id entify subjects by [CONTACT_705650]/or  assigned 
number only. 
The Investigator must also compl ete a subject screening log which reports on all subj ects who 
were seen to d etermine eligibility for inclusion in the  study. 
11.3. Source Documentat ion 
The Investigator  will maintain a list of qualified staff to whom study responsibilities have been 
delegated. These individuals authorized to fulfill these responsibilities should be outlined and 
included in the Delegation of Authority Form.  
Source documents are original documents, data, and records for which the study data are 
collected and verified. Example of such source documents may include, but are not limited to, 
subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/medical  records, laboratory reports, physicians’ and nurses’ notes, subject 
eDiaries and correspondence. At a  minimum, sou rce documentation must be  available for the 
followi ng: subject identification, eligibility, and stu dy identification; d ate of subject consent,  
dates of visits, results of  safety and efficacy parameters as required by [CONTACT_760], record of all 
AEs, follow -up of  AEs,  concomitant medication, d rug receipt/disp ensing/return records, stu dy 
drug administ ration information, l aboratory printouts (if not available di gitally), date of study 
compl etion, and reason for early discontinu ation of  study drugs or withd rawal from the  study, if 
applicable.  
The Investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive filing system 
of all subject records that are readily available to support monitoring activities in compliance 
with ICH -GCP guidelines and regulatory and institutional require ments for the protection of 
confidentiality of subjects. The Investigator shall supply the Sponsor or designee, on request, 
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
65 CONFIDENTIAL  with any required background data from the study documentation or clinic records. Such requests 
may occur, for example, when documen ts are illegible or when errors in data transcription are 
suspected. In case of requests for audit inspections and/or queries from National 
Authorities/Regulatory Agency, it will be necessary to have access to the complete study records, 
provided that subj ect confidentiality is maintained.  
No study documents should be discarded without prior written agreement between the Sponsor 
and the Investigator. Should storage no longer be available to archive source documents or must 
be moved to an alternative locati on, the site should notify the key sponsor contact [CONTACT_705651][INVESTIGATOR_705556].  
11.4. Case Report Form Completion 
Authorized study site personnel will complete eCRFs designed specifically for this study and 
completion guidelines will be provided. An eCRF is required and must be completed for each 
subject enrolled into the study and will be available for all data required to be entered into the 
clinical database and must match the data contained in the study specific source documentation. 
The Investigator w ill ensure that the eCRFs are accurate, complete and legible. The Investigator 
will ensure that source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of 
data transcribed on the eCRFs are never obliterated or destroyed. As required by t he protocol, 
eCRFs should also be completed for those subjects who fail to complete the study. If a subject 
withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF and thorough efforts should be 
made to clearly document outcome.  
The eCRFs will be m aintained in an electronic data collection system for this study. After the 
Investigator or designees have been appropriately trained, they will be given access to the EDC 
system and will be able to enter the data required by [CONTACT_760]. Any change of da ta will be 
made via the EDC system, with all changes tracked by [CONTACT_314241].  
11.5. Study M onitoring 
The Sponsor is responsible for assuring the proper conduct of the study with regard to protocol 
adherence and validity of the data record ed on the eCRFs. Subject confidentiality will be 
maintained.  
In addition, clinical monitors designated by [CONTACT_705652], 
primarily to conduct  remote monitoring visits  but with option for on-site visits if deemed 
necessary . The remote and on -site monitoring visits will be conducted as frequently as necessary 
to ensure that all aspects of the study are carefully monitored for compliance with applicable 
government regulations with respect to current GCP practice and the current  SOPs. The visits 
will be conducted in accordance with the Sponsor’s SOP and Clinical Monitoring Plan.  
The unblinded clinical  monitor will be limited to observation (via review of documentation  or if 
deemed necessary in real -time whether remote or on -site) of IP preparation , delivery device 
filling, adherence to randomization to treatment group, and storage of IP and IP accountability. 
They will not participate in activities related to subject assessments.

scientific data, prior clinical data, formulation in formation)  suppli ed by [CONTACT_890506] p revious ly publish ed, and any data generated as a result of  this stu dy are 
considered confidential and remain the  sole property of the Sponso r. The  Investigator agrees to 
maintain this in formation in confidence, to use  this in formation on ly to accomplish this study, 
and not to use  it for other purposes without the Sponso r’s prior written consent. 
The Investigator understands th at the information generated in this clinical study will be us ed by 
[CONTACT_705656], and thus m ay be 
disclosed as required to oth er clinical Investigators or regulatory agencies. To p ermit in formation 
derived from the  clinical studi es to be  used, the  Investigator is obli ged to p rovide  the Sponsor  
with all data obtained in the  study. 
The results of  the study will be  reported in a  Clinical Study Report (CSR) generated und er the 
responsibili ty of the Sponsor and will contain EDC  system data from all clinical sites that 
participated in the  study. Recruitment performance or specific expertise related to the  nature and 
the key assessment parameters of the study will be  used to determine  a coordinating Investigator. 
Clinical narratives may be written for the following  events (for example): 
• All d eaths (irrespective of drug relationship)  
• All oth er SAEs du ring treatment with the  study drugs 
• All dis continu ations of  the study drugs due to AEs  (irrespective of drug 
relationship)  
• Any events of  special interest explicitly requested by [CONTACT_397149] 
• At the  discretion of  the team and after statistical analysis of  the data, certain 
discontinu ations not related to AEs or  treatment failure, i.e., related to lost to 
follow -up or  withd rawal of consent (irrespective of treatment group). 
The Sponsor and Medical Monitor  will si gn off the final version of  the CSR.  A summ ary of this 
final version will be  provided to the  Investigators, the applicable regulatory authorities, and the  
IRBs, if required by [CONTACT_1214], within 1  year after the end of the 
study (LPLV).

11.14.  Confident iality 
Subject confidentiality is strictly held by [CONTACT_778], their staff, and the 
Sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological 
samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participating subjects.  
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in st rict 
confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized 
third party without prior written approval of the Sponsor.  
The clinical  monitor s or other authorized representatives of the Sponsor may inspect all 
docume nts and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_737] , including but not limited 
to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records for the subjects in this 
study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
The Investigator must assure that subjects’ anonymity will be maintained and that their identities 
are protected from unauthorized parties. Throughout this study, all data will be linked to the 
eCRF via a unique identification number. The data will be blinded correspondingly in all data 
analyses. The Investigator should keep a subject enrollment log showing codes, names and 
FluGen, Inc.  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL – FLUGEN -H3N2 -V005  9 Sep  2021 (v 3.0) 
70 CONFIDENTIAL  addresses. The Investigator should maintain documents that are not for submission to the 
Sponsor (such as written consent forms) in strict confidence.  
However, in compliance with the ICH Guidelines and in fulfillment of its obligations to FluGen 
to verify compliance with this protocol, FluGen Inc. or its designee requires that the Investigator 
permit FluGen designated monitors, representativ es from any Regulatory Authority, FluGen 
designated auditors, or the appropriate Independent Ethics Committee, to review the subject’s 
primary medical records (source data or documents) including, but not limited to, laboratory test 
result reports, admissi on and discharge summaries, and SAEs occurring during the study. Should 
access to such medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the statement of 
informed consent, the Investigator will obtain such permission in writing from the subje ct before 
the subject is entered into the study.

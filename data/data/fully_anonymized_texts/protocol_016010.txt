While you are participating,  you will weigh  yourself regularly and track what you eat.
oWe will give you a cellular scale to keep at home. This scale  will use cell towers 
to send a record of your weight  to the manufacturer, BodyTrace.  BodyTrace will 
then send your data to our data system,  called Prompt. If the scale is damaged 
during the study, it will be up to the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_756264].
oTo track  what you eat daily, we will ask you to download 2 applications  (“apps”) 
onto your smartphone. One is Fitbit, and the other is MyFitnessPal/Calorie  
Tracker. You will use MyFitnessPal  to track your food and drink. MyFitnessPal 
will send your entries to Fitbit, and Fitbit  will send  data to our system  (Prompt).
You will be asked to create an account on two apps: MyFitnessPal and 
Fitbit. We will use a false email address  to create the account. All other 
registration information for MyFitnessPal and Fitbit (name,  date of birth) 
can also be false information provided by [CONTACT_3476].  However,  if 
you prefer, you can provide your actual  information.
You will receive text messages between 1 – 4 times per week with reminders and 
other study messages.
Should you change  your cell phone number during the study, we ask that you notify us 
at [PHONE_15774].
At the end of the study, we will help you delete  the MyFitnessPal and Fitbit apps and 
any health data installed on your phone  or transmitted through these devices.  We will 
not do this if you choose to continue using the apps. 
After the study is over, you will have  the option of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_756265]. If you choose to 
keep it, you can keep using it to weigh yourself. However, we will disconnect it from 
our system (Prompt) so we will not be able to see those weights.  
At the end of the study, we may ask you to participate in a telephone interview  to get 
your feedback  about the study. This interview  will be audio recorded and will be stored 
on a Duke server. Access will be restricted  to only members of the study team. We will 
transcribe the interviews so that we can analyze your responses. The transcriptions 
will not contain information that can be used to identify you (e.g., your name).  We will 
use a study ID instead of your name.

Your participation in this study  will last about [ADDRESS_1034979].
WHAT ARE  THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?
The low carbohydrate  diet may cause  dehydration  (lightheadedness or feeling faint), muscle 
cramps, headache, bad breath, constipation,  or kidney  stones. Drinking adequate fluids  (at least  
six 8-ounce glasses  of water each day) can prevent  these effects. Less frequently, some people 
may experience diarrhea or increased  cholesterol levels. Other  side effects associated with weight 
loss could include hair loss, fatigue, weakness,  feeling too cold, and electrolyte abnormalities, or 
gallstones (signs of gallstones can include  pain in your upper right abdomen,  nausea  and vomiting, 
fever, or changes  in the color of your urine or stool). Also,  low blood sugar or low blood pressure 
(fatigue, lightheadedness, or fainting) may occur during weight loss if you are taking medications 
for diabetes or high blood pressure.
Being a part of this study while  pregnant may expose the unborn  child to significant risks, some of 
which may be currently unforeseeable. Therefore,  pregnant women  will be excluded from the 
study. If you are a woman  of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy  test will be done, and it must  
be negative before you can be randomized in this study. If sexually active, you must agree to use 
appropriate contraceptive  measures for the duration of the study. Medically acceptable 
contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization (such as a tubal ligation or hysterectomy),  (2) 
approved hormonal  contraceptives (such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, implants or injections), (3) 
barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used  with a spermicide, or (4) an intrauterine  
device (IUD). Contraceptive measures such as Plan B (TM),  sold for emergency use after 
unprotected sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use. If you do become pregnant during  
this study or if you have unprotected  sex, you must inform  your study doctor immediately.
Some of the questions  we will ask you as part of this study may make you feel uncomfortable. You 
may refuse to answer any of the questions  and you may take a break at any time during the study.  
You may stop your participation in this study at any time.   
There is the potential  risk of loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep your 
information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed. The information we gather will be 
kept in databases  on password-protected computers at Duke. Your data will also be accessible to 
[CONTACT_756277], who is at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The information we collect will be used  
only for this study. Only study staff approved by [CONTACT_756267] (IRB)  will be 
able to see your information.   None of your data will ever be sent to third parties except as 
described in this consent form,  with your permission, or as may be required by [CONTACT_2371].
Information collected by [INVESTIGATOR_23470] (cellular scales)  and mobile  apps is subject  to their terms of use, 
which you should read carefully.   Many apps make claims that they are very secure, compliant with 
federal privacy regulations, and used  and tested by [CONTACT_756268]. However,  any mobile 
app that is downloaded carries  potential security risks, and Duke cannot  guarantee  that these 
mobile apps are free of risk.  Some  apps may be able to perform hidden functions or may have

security flaws that allow unauthorized access  to information. We are unable to fully tell you what  
information these mobile apps  are able to access or change on your phone or what information 
from your phone  may be stored outside of Duke.  These apps may send/receive information with 
other mobile  apps,  including social networking apps or websites  (for example, Facebook).  If you 
give permission  for this, the terms of use for those apps/websites apply and you should read them  
carefully. Similarly,  there  are potential  security risks with the cellular scale.
It is recommended that you run a current  operating system  (OS) on your device,  review the 
privacy/security settings often, and restrict any unnecessary access. These applications may run in 
the background of your device. Mobile apps may have unanticipated impact on the operations of 
your device (e.g., battery  drainage). If you do not have an unlimited data/text  plan, you may incur 
additional charges. At the conclusion of the study,  we will provide you instructions on how to 
remove the mobile apps  from your device.
We are not asking you to make any health decisions based  on the use of these devices or mobile 
apps. You should discuss health  decisions  directly with your healthcare provider.  
As with all technology, we ask you to wait until you are in a safe environment, use good judgment 
and follow  prevailing  laws. Do not perform study-related activities while you are driving.
ARE THERE BENEFITS  TO TAKING PART  IN THE STUDY?
If you agree to take part in this study, you may lose weight and experience benefits  that occur with 
weight loss. We hope that in the future  the information learned from this study will benefit other 
people who have difficulty losing weight. 
WILL MY INFORMATION BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL?
Study records that identify you at Duke University and the University  of Wisconsin-Madison will be 
kept confidential as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Federal Privacy Regulations  provide  safeguards  for privacy, 
security, and authorized access.  Except when  required by [CONTACT_2371], or as outlined  in this consent,  you 
will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], social security number, address, telephone  number, or any other 
direct personal identifier  in study records disclosed outside of Duke University  Health  System 
(DUHS). In addition,  your records may be reviewed in order to meet federal or state regulations.  
Reviewers may include representatives from the Food and Drug Administration or representatives 
of the Duke  University Health System Institutional Review Board. If any of these groups review 
your research record, they may also need to review your entire medical record.
In order to keep in touch  with you, we will collect phone  numbers where you can be reached. This 
information will be encrypted and stored  in a remote secure database.  
Many applications on your smartphone  and email services you commonly use work with text, 
email, and cloud-based companies to send and receive information. In order to send you send  text 
messages, we use Twilio, Heroku, and Amazon S3. These  companies encrypt your information on 
their servers, but no system is completely safe.   If these companies  decide to share these  data,  it 
may no longer be covered under  the privacy protections.  Text messaging does  not provide a 
completely secure  and confidential means of communication.

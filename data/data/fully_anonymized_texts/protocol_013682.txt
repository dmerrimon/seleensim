CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX023-CL301 Amendment 1 (Global)  
03 November  2017 
 
The original version of Protocol UX023 -CL301 (dated 04 April 2016) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] 1 (Global)  to extend the duration of the study , to clarify procedures, and to 
incorporate changes based on additional information acquired since the beginning of the 
study from the clinical investigators and from Health Authorities.  The major changes to the 
protocol are summarized below; additional minor changes have also bee n made for 
consistency and clarity but are not included in this summary.  
1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
a. Treatment Periods and Treatment Duration: A Treatment Extension P eriod was 
added to the study for  subjects in Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia  
(Section 7.1). All subjects who continue into the Treatment Extension Period 
will receive KRN23 ( refer to Summary of Change Item #1b).  The total 
treatment duration will vary by [CONTACT_11338]. For subjects at study sites in Japan and 
Korea, the final visit for the study (ie, the end of the Treatment Period ) will be 
Week 64 (final dose of KRN23 at Week 62 ); subjects in these countries will be 
enrolled into a separate clinical trial of KRN23  or will receive KRN23 through 
another mechanism . For subjects in Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia, the 
study consists of the Treatment Period (64  weeks) and the Treatment Extension 
Period (up to 76  weeks) fo r a total treatment duration of up to 140  weeks. 
For subjects in Europe and Australia , the Treatment Extension Period will end 
in September 2018 ; subjects will be enrolled into separate clinical trials of 
KRN23 or will receive KRN23 through another mechanism . For subjects in the US 
and Canada , the Treatment Extension Period will end in September 2018  and 
June 2019, respectively, when commercial KRN23 is expected to be available ; 
subjects will receive commercial KRN23 or will receive KRN23 through another 
mechanism . The total duration of treatment  in this study  for subjects in Europe, 
the US, Canada, and Australia will vary based on the subjects’ initial date of 
enrollment but will not exceed 140 weeks . 
Rationale : It is important to p revent treatment interruption in children with XLH 
to maximize their bone health and growth potential. The 76-week Treatment 
Extension Period has been added to provide KRN23 treatment until KRN23 is 
expected to be commercially available  in regions of the clinical s ites 
participating in the study .  
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017  
 
 
Confidential  Page 3 
b. Treatment in Treatment Extension Period  (subjects in Europe, the US, Canada, 
and Australia  only). After completion of the 64-week Treatment Period, 
subjects who were  randomized to KRN23 will continue treatment with KRN23 , 
and subjects randomized to active control will cross over to receive open -label 
KRN23 at the starting dose and regimen administered to subjects in the KRN23 
arm. Subjects in the active control arm will discontinue treatment  the day after 
the Week [ADDRESS_910503] dose of KRN23 at Week  66 (Synopsis [Study 
Design and Methodology, Duration of Treatment], Section 7.6 and subsections)  
Rationale : This change implements the extension of treatment as noted in the 
original protocol, “Subjects from either treatment groups who complete the 
active controlled Treatment Period of the stud y (64 weeks) may be eligible for 
an extension study and receive KRN23 treatment for up to an additional 
96 weeks or until the study drug is commercially available .”  
c. Procedures:  Evaluation of PD parameters, rickets, growth, and safety will 
continue in the Treatment E xtension period. The description of  the timing of the 
planned analyses has been clarified, and additional analyses time points have 
been added for the Treatment Extension Period at Week s 88, Week 112, and 
end of study  (Synopsis [Study Design and  Methodology, Duration of 
Treatment], Section 7.6 and subsections). All AEs will be recorded from the 
time the informed consent is signed through [ADDRESS_910504] enrolls in another clinical study of KRN23, is 
treated with commercially available KRN23, or is treated with KRN23 through 
another mechanism, at which point the collection of AEs within this  study is no 
longer applicable  (however, AEs will continue to be reported either under 
another KRN23 protocol or per post -approval requirements for safety 
monitoring, as applicable ).  
Rationale:  Describes planned evaluations of the s afety and efficacy parameters 
that will continue to be followed while subjects remain on study and receive 
treatment.  
d. End of Study : In Section 7.1 and related sections, the description of the study 
periods has been updated to describe the end of study procedures for different  
regions. For subjects in Japan and Korea, the End of Study (EOS) Visit is 
Week 64 (referred to as “Week 64/EOS I”) . Subjects in Europe, the US, 
Canada, and Australia will have an EOS visit that includes efficacy assessments 
(EOS II). (refer to Summary of Change Item #1e).  (Synopsis [Study Design and 
Methodology], Section  7.4.4, and Section 7.5.1). 
Rationale:  These changes  clarify the end of study procedures for different 
regions. 
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017  
 
 
Confidential  Page 4 
e. Safety follow -up: All subjects are expected to continue KRN23 treatment 
post-study in another clinical trial, through commercial use, or through another 
mechanism; post -study safety follow -up calls and safety visits will occur only 
for subjects who are not documented to be continuing on KRN23 at the EOS 
visits. A safety follow -up telephon e call will occur at 5  weeks (+5 days) after 
the Week 64/EOS I or EOS II visit, as applicable, to determine if KRN23 
therapy has been started in another clinical trial, as commercial product, or 
through another mechanism; if KRN23 therapy has not been started, 
information on any o ngoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications  
will be collected . For subjects who do not continue KRN23 therapy,  
an additional safety visit will occur 12 weeks ±[ADDRESS_910505] required subjects 
return to the clinic for the final safety visit; however, subjects who are unable to 
return to the clinic for the final safety visit will be given the option of providing 
blood and urine samples as part of a Home Health  visit. The end of the study is 
defined as the date of the last protocol -specified procedures (including 
telephone contact) for the last subject in the study  (Synopsis [Study Design and 
Methodology], Section  7.4.4, and Section 7.5.1). 
Rationale:  These changes  clarify the post-study procedures . 
f. Clarified that “at least” (rather than “approximately”) 20 subjects age  1 to 
< 5 years will be included ( Synopsis [Study Design and Methodology], 
Section 7.1 and Section  7.3). 
Rationale:  Clarifies the intent of the protocol to have at least 20 subjects 
enrolled who are age 1 to < 5 years. 
g. The maximum proportion of female subjects was increased from 60% to 70% 
(Synopsis [Study Design and Methodology], Section  7.1, and Section 7.3). 
Rationale:  The proportion of female subjects allowed into the study was 
increased to better reflect the gender distribution of X -linked dominant disease  
and study experience . 
h. Specified  that the terms “study drug” and “investigational product” refer to 
KRN23, and “active control” and “active control arm” refer to oral 
phosphate/active vitamin  D therapy (Section 4, Definition of Terms).  
Rationale : Clarification of nomenclature . 
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): [ADDRESS_910506]-prandial serum phosphorus and 
calcium concentrations. Assessments for this substudy will occur at a single 
clinic visit  anytime 10 to 14 days after a KRN23  dose; this clinic visit  may take 
the place of a Home Health visit . Approximately 20 subjects, age  ≥ [ADDRESS_910507] of a standardized meal . Dietary phosphate will be estimated 
based on the calculated phosphate content and the amount of food consumed. 
Serum samples  will be drawn 1 and 2  hours after the completion of the meal.  
(Synopsis [ Study Design and Methodology, Exploratory Assessments], 
Table 2.1 - Table 2.3 [footnote #1 2], Section  7.1, Section [IP_ADDRESS], new 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
Rationale : KRN23 blocks FGF23 action, leading to a sustained increase in 
serum phosphorus levels due to increased phosphate reabsorption at the distal 
renal tubule (measured as TmP/GFR ) and increased intestinal absorption caused 
by [CONTACT_67191] 1,25(OH) 2D. The effect of burosumab on postprandial 
physiological excursion s of serum phosphorus has not been studied. The 
substudy was added to evaluate the post-prandial increases in serum phosphorus 
during KRN23 treatment . 
2. Selection of Study Population  
a. Inclusion Criterion #4 was revised to “Serum creatinine below age -adjusted 
upper normal limit ” (Synopsis [Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion and 
Exclusion], Section 7.3.1). 
Rationale : The criterion was revised to align with the original intent that 
subjects with serum creatinine values higher than the age -adjusted upper limit of 
normal should not be included in the study. Low  serum creatinine is not a 
concern and should not be a consideration for eligibility.  
b. Inclusion Criterion #6 was revised to indicate that conventional therapy  should 
be discontinued  “…7 days prior to the Randomization Visit ” rather than 
“…prior to the Screening Visit ” (Synopsis [Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion 
and Exclusion],  Section 7.3.1). 
Rationale : The change in the window w ill give subjects more time to meet th is 
requirement.  It is clinically immaterial whether subjects meet the requirement 
prior to the Screening visit or prior to Randomization Visit.  
c. Inclusion Criterion #10 was updated to require sexually active male subjects 
with female partners of childbearing potential  to use a condom with spermicide 
or a highly effective method of contraception (rather than 2 methods) for the 
duration of the study  plus 12 weeks after stopp ing the study drug .  
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017  
 
 
Confidential  Page 6 
Rationale:  Changes to contraception and pregnancy testing language were made 
to align with the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) r ecommendations 
related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials.  
d. Exclusion Criter ion #1 was revised to specify that Tanner stage 4 or higher is 
assessed through physical examination in any of the following: genitals, breast, 
or pubic hair  (Synopsis [Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion],  
Section 7.3.2). 
Rationale : Added to specify physical exam requirements . 
e. Exclusion Criterion #7 was corrected to “Planned orthopedic surgery, including 
osteotomy or implantation  or removal of staples, [ADDRESS_910508] 40 weeks of the study ” (Synopsis [Diagnosis and 
Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion], Section 7.3.2). 
Rationale:  The language was corrected to match the language in the Synopsis. 
“Recommended” terminology was removed to provide greater specificity for the 
criteria. Also the timeframe of the surgery prior to Screening was clarif ied to 
match the Synopsis.  
3. Schedule of Events (Table s 2.1-2.3) 
a. Added Table 2.3, Schedule of Events – Treatment Extension Period 
Weeks 66-140 
Rationale : To define assessments for the [ADDRESS_910509] reached menarche.  
Rationale : The additional assessments were added for female subjects of 
childbearing potential administered KRN23 (ie, those assigned to KRN23 
initially and those who cross over  to KRN23 in the Treatment Extension 
Period). 
c. Clarified that all study visits will be scheduled relative to the Baseline visit, 
with an allowable variance of ±3 days for each visit (with the e xception of the 
Screening and Safety Follow -up Visits) to accommodate scheduling ; clarified 
that KRN23 dosing should occur no sooner than [ADDRESS_910510] dose 
administered, and that the Safety Follow -up Visit visit has an allowable 
variance of ±7 day s (Table 2.1 - Table 2.3 [footnote #1 ], Section 7.4.1, and 
Section 7.5.1).  
Rationale : Provides clarity to facilitate subject scheduling.  
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017  
 
 
Confidential  Page 7 
d. Changed “within 7 days” to “after 7 days” to describe the time frame when 
subjects may return to the site after wean ing from oral phosphate/ active 
vitamin D therapy  (Section 7.5.1).  
Rationale : For consistency with Section [IP_ADDRESS] and the intent of the protocol  
4. Study Drug  
a. Specified that subjects may resume KRN23 at half of the last dose received 
(ie, half the dose of either 0.8 or 1.2 mg/kg) following withdrawal from KRN23 
due to increased serum phosphorus levels above the upper limit of normal 
(ULN), with a maximum dose of 40  mg (Synopsis [Study Design and 
Methodology; Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Admi nistration], 
Section 7.1 and Section 7.4.1). The maximum allowable dose of KRN23  was 
defined as 90  mg per administration . Additional language has been added to 
define the term “unscheduled serum phosphorus assessment.”  
Rationale:  The language on KRN23 dose, including the maximum dose 
requiremen ts and definition of an unscheduled serum phosphorus assessment,  
provides greater specificity and clarity consistent with the original intent of the 
protocol.  
b. Changed criterion 2 for dose escalation, from “ serum phosphorus has increased 
by < 0.5 mg/dL from baseline ” to “serum phosphorus has increased by 
≤ 0.5 mg/dL from baseline ” (Synopsis [Study Design and Methodology; 
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration], Section 7.1 and 
Section 7.4.1). 
Rationale:  Based on investigator input and clinical experience thus far in the 
study, some subjects with low serum phosphorus at Baseline who have met the 
other dose escalation criteria and who have responded to KRN23 (increase in  
serum phosphorus of 0.5 mg/dL) would likely benefit from a higher dose of 
KRN23.  
c. Buttocks are included as  a potential injection site for the administration of 
KRN23, and guidance provided to clarify the rotation of injection sites 
(Synopsis [Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration], 
Section 7.4.1).  
Rationale:  Buttocks were added to the list of potential  injection site s to allow 
for flexibility in administration . In addition, the text regarding i njection site 
rotation was clarified to provide guidance the rotation of the site with each 
injection. While the Sponsor’s preference is to rotate the site of injection to 
minimize the risk for an injection site reaction, this is not always possible in 
practice in a pediatric popula tion based on subject fat distribution and subject 
preference.  The injection location should be rotated at each visit.  
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017  
 
 
Confidential  Page 8 
5. Prohibited Medications  
a. Clarified that active vitamin D, not vitamin D supplementation, is prohibited in 
the KRN23 treatment arm (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Rationale : The original protocol stated that subjects in the KRN23 treatment 
arm were prohibited from receiving oral phosphates and vitam in D for the 
duration of the study. This has been corrected to oral phosphates and active 
vitamin D because vitamin D supplementation is allowed during the study to 
correct for clinically meaningful low nutritional vitamin D laboratory values.  
6. Efficacy Assessments  
a. Provided additional information regarding the collection of historical radiograph 
images and recumbent length/standing height data  prior to Screening 
(Section 7.5.1).  
Rationale : Provides greater specificity to the data collection process. 
The radiographs will be used to evaluate rickets severity and to determine how 
much rickets fluctuate over time in patients who were treated with oral 
phosphate/active vitamin D prior to study enrollment.  The recumbent 
length/standing height data will be used to evaluate growth over time in patients 
who were treated with oral phosphate/active vitamin D prior to study 
enrollment . 
b. A new section, Change in Lower Extremity Abnormalities,  has been added to 
describe how this endpoint will be evaluated  (Section [IP_ADDRESS].2).  
Rationale : To provide details on  how changes in lower extremity abnormalities 
will be measured over time.  
c. Provided greater clarity about how growth will be assessed  (Section [IP_ADDRESS].3). 
At each time point, height will be assessed 3 times; an average of the 
3 measurements will be calculated. For subjects <  2 years old, recumbent length 
will be used as the growth measurement. For subjects ≥ 2 years  old, standing 
and sitting heights w ill be collected for growth measurement . (Table 2.1 - 
Table 2.3 [footnote #5], Section [IP_ADDRESS].3). 
Rationale : To describe how height will be measured.  
d. The method used to calculate the ratio of the maximum renal tubular 
reabsorption rate of phosphate to the glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) was 
updated to Payne, 1998 ( Section [IP_ADDRESS].4).  
Rationale : The protocol was updated to include the appropriate reference.  
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): [ADDRESS_910511] rument will be used (rather that V ersion 1.0 ) 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS].5). 
Rationale : To reflect the study use of the updated version of PROMIS 
(Version 2.0). 
f. Clarified the process for a subject ≥ 8 years old at Screening who has difficulty 
completing the PROMIS s elf-report (Section [IP_ADDRESS].5). 
Rationale : To allow completion of the PROMIS Parent Proxy while maintaining 
consistent practice  in cases where a ch ild 8 to ≤ [ADDRESS_910512] a blood sample drawn for these assessments (Section [IP_ADDRESS].6 and 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].2). 
Rationale : PK and ADA assessments  are relevant to subjects in the KRN23 
treatment arm and are not necessary for subjects in the active control arm  during 
the Treatment Period . 
8. Safety Assess ments 
a. Clarified the acceptable method for measuring blood pressure and updated t he 
literature reference (Tables 2.1-2.3 [footnote # 14] and Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Rationale : The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI) guidelines 
specifically recommend auscultation as the preferred method for measuring 
blood pressure and have reported that automated devices do not always closely 
match with  those obtained by [CONTACT_162014] .  
b. Specified that the genitourinary exam should be non -invasive, age -appropriate, 
and consistent with the investigator’s standard of care , and that the purpose of 
the exam is establish and monitor Tanner staging  (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Rationale : To clarify the scope and purpose of the genitourinary exam . 
c. Added the definition of a highly effective contraceptive method 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Rationale:  Changes to contraception and pregnancy testing language were made 
to align with the CTFG recommendations related to contrace ption and 
pregnancy testing in clinical trials.  
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017  
 
 
Confidential  Page 10 
d. Clarified “dental events” as  “dental caries, tooth extraction, root canal, dental 
abscesses, and gingivitis” ( Synopsis [Exploratory Assessments], Table 2.1 - 
Table 2.3 [footnote # 19], Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Rationale:  To specify the events to be evaluated for the assessment of dental 
health. 
e. Clarified serious adverse event (SAE) reporting for the active control arm 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and added Appendix 1, which serves as reference safety 
information (RSI) for the oral phosphate and active vitamin D products used in 
the active control arm of this study.  
Rationale : The study allows use of different oral phosphate and active 
vitamin D products that are approved in several European Union (EU) Member 
States with different Summaries of Product Characteristics ( SmPCs). Per CT3 
section [IP_ADDRESS]. (54) and CTFG , the sponsor is required to select the most 
appropriate SmPC, with reference to subject safety, as the RSI. The Sponsor has 
selected the SmPCs in Appendix [ADDRESS_910513] weight is determined ( Table 2.1 - Table 2.3 
[footnote # 15], Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Rationale : The instruction is clarified to match the original intent of the protocol 
to use the most recent in clinic weight as the basis for dose calculation.  
g. Section [IP_ADDRESS], Pregnancy Re porting, was deleted  
Rationale : Text was redundant with text in Section [IP_ADDRESS], Pregnancy in 
Subject or Partner, and Requirements for Immediate Re porting. 
9. Investigators and Study Administrative Structure  
a. Included a requirement for a Coordinating Investigator  (Section 8.2). 
The Coordinating In vestigator is Erik Imel, MD (Indiana University School of 
Medicine).  
Rationale : Regulatory guidance in the EU requires designation of a 
Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a multicenter clinical trial.

2 SYNOPSIS  
TITLE OF STUDY:  
A Randomized, Open -Label, Phase 3 Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of KRN23 Versus Oral 
Phosphate and Active Vitamin D Treatment  in Pediatric Patients with  X-linked Hypophosphatemia 
(XLH) 
PROTOCOL NUMBER : 
UX023-CL301 
STUDY SITES:  
Approximately 30 sites globally  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 3 
RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY:  
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH)  is a disorder of renal phosphate wasting , defective bone 
mineralization , and impaired growth plate or endochondral ossification caused  by [CONTACT_673711] (phosphate -regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the 
X chromosome), and is the most common form of heritable rickets. In the  absence of functional 
PHEX, release of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF2 3) by [CONTACT_492357] , leading to 
impaired conservation of  phosphate  and consequent hypophosphatemia. FGF23 also  suppresses 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2D) production, resulting in decreased intestinal absorption of 
calcium and phospha te. Chronic low serum phosphorus levels result in defective bone mineralization 
and the 2 major pathologic consequences of the hypophosphatemia , rickets and osteomalacia . 
Rickets and osteomalacia are both disorders of bone mineralization; however, rickets is a disease of 
the growth plates specifically characterized by [CONTACT_673712], leading to reduced growth and skeletal deformities. The goal of therapy in 
children with XLH is to correct or minimize  rickets, radiographic abnormalities, and skeletal 
deformities, and to promote maximal growth potential while preventing the lifelong bone - and 
joint-related complications of rickets. Published retrospective data suggest that earlier treatment leads 
to better outcomes for children with XLH (Makitie et al. 2003 ), (Quinlan et al. 2012 ). 
Although t here are no approved treatments  specific for XLH, the most common therapy for children 
with XLH consists of multiple daily doses of oral phosphate combined with doses of active vitamin D 
analogs, the most common being calcitriol and alfacalcidol. Dosing is individualized and depends on 
tolerability of the phosphate dose and the age, size, and growth of the child. The goal of therapy with 
phosphate and active vitamin D is to sufficiently supplement the body’s pool of phosphate to a llow 
mineralization of bone and improve skeletal outcomes; however, because supplementation therapy 
does not address the mechanism of urinary phosphate wasting, increasing phosphate through 
supplementation also increases renal phosphate throughput and urin ary phosphate concentrations, thus 
raising the risk of nephrocalcinosis.  More therapeutic options that are efficacious, safe, and 
convenient, and that target the underlying pathophysiology of XLH  (ie, renal phosphate wasting 
induced by [CONTACT_673713]23 levels ), are needed.

Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017

KRN23 is a recombinant human IgG 1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the activity of 
FGF23. Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in adults and children (aged 5 -12 years) with XLH have shown 
that KRN23 increases serum phosphorus  and 1,25(OH) 2D levels and the ratio of renal tubular 
maximum reabsorption rate of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate  (TmP/GFR) . Initial 40-week 
Phase 2 data (UX023-CL201) in  children with  XLH (aged 5-12 years) suggest that KRN23 treatment 
also improves rickets severity with a favorable safety profile. The 40-week interim analysis 
demonstrated  that KRN23 significantly  improved rickets across the 2 dosing groups, with subjects in 
the every 2 weeks (Q2W) dosing group having better ou tcomes that may reflect the more steady levels 
of serum phosphorus, 1,25(OH) 2D, and other PD parameters observed with Q2W dosing than with 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) dosing of KRN23.  
Data from the ongoing pediatric Phase 2 study helped  establish the dose regimen  and provide d 
information for the des ign of this Phase 3 clinical trial in children with XLH. Interim data from  the 
pediatric Phase 2 study  suggested KRN23, administered Q2W at approximately 0.8  mg/kg for 
40 weeks, increased serum phosphorus by [CONTACT_5554] 0.7 mg/ dL; increases of > 0.5 mg/dL were 
seen in 83.3% of subjects . Serum 1,25(OH) 2D concentrations and TmP/GFR levels also increased, 
demonstrating overall improved phosphorus homeostasis . The increases in serum phosphorus and 
1,25(OH) 2D were sufficient to provide substantial healing of rickets . No subjects have experienced 
serum phosphorus levels above the upper limit of normal. The Q2W dosing regimen was chosen for 
this Phase 3 study because it appear ed to produce a more stable and consistent  increase in serum 
phosphorus levels with less fluctuation over time than the Q4W dosing regimen, and a safety profile 
that was not substantially different from  the Q4W dosing regimen.  
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of KRN23  on improving  rickets, maximizing 
growth, and restoring phosphorus homeostasis  compared with active control ( oral phosphate/active 
vitamin D therapy), as well as to evaluate the safety of KRN23, in children with XLH (aged 1 to 
≤ 12 years) with confirmed evidenc e of rickets. In addition, this study will evaluate whether every 
2 week dosing of KRN23 improves functional outcomes and quality of life in children with XLH.  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective s: 
 Evaluate the effect of KRN23  therapy in improving rickets in children with XLH  compared with 
active control ( oral phosphate/active vitamin D )  
Secondary Efficacy Objectives:

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY :  
UX023-CL301 is a multicenter, randomized, open -label, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and 
safety of KRN23 with active control ( oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy) in children with 
clinical evidence consistent with XLH (aged 1 to ≤ 12 years), including demonstrated 
hypophosphatemia,  radiographic evidence of rickets ( ≥ 2.0 points RSS total score ), and PHEX 
mutation or variants of uncertain significance. Patients will also be required to have  open epi[INVESTIGATOR_673686]/active vitamin  D therapy for ≥ 12 consecutive months (for children 
≥ 3 years of age) or ≥ 6 consecutive months (for children <  3 years of age)  7 days prior to the 
Randomization Visit . Approximately  60 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive open -label KRN23 
administered by [CONTACT_673714] D therapy  for a total of 
64 weeks in the Treatment Period . Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_673715] (RSS  
total score  ≤ 2.5 vs > 2.5) and age (< 5 vs ≥ 5 years). At least 20 subjects aged 1  to < 5 years will be 
included (approximately 10 in each treatment arm ), and no more than 10 subjects between the ages of 
1 to < 3 years will be enrolled . The age range of eligible subjects will be monitored for enrollment for 
age distribution. No more than 70% female subjects will be enrolled.  All subjects will washout of oral 
phosphate and active vitamin  D therapy for 7 days prior to randomization.   
Treatment Period (Weeks 0 – 64) – All Subjects  
Subjects randomized to KRN23 will remain off of oral phosphate /active vitamin D therapy throughout 
the duration of the study.  Subjects assigned to the KRN23 treatment group will receive KRN23 at a 
starting dose of 0.8  mg/kg Q2W. The dose may be increased to 1.2 mg/kg at any time during the study 
if a subject meets the following dose -adjustment criteria: 1) 2 consecutive serum phosphorus 
measurements are below the normal range; 2) serum phosphorus has increased by ≤ 0.5 mg/dL from 
baseline; and 3) the subject has not missed a dose of KRN23 that would account for the decrease in 
serum phosphorus.  The maximum allowable dose of KRN23 per administration is 90  mg. At any time 
during the study, if serum phosphorus increases above the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, the 
subsequent dose(s) will be withheld and the site will contact [CONTACT_274039] r before dosing 
resumes. Once other causes of increased serum phosphorus are excluded, KRN23 treatment will 
resume at half the total dose of the last dose received  (ie, half of either 0.8 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg ; 
maximum dose per administration: 40  mg). Serum p hosphorus will be followed through unscheduled 
serum phosphorus assessments  (approximately [ADDRESS_910514] -dose and assessed by [CONTACT_11378]; the assessments may be repeated as necessary ). A subject will resume dosing at the 
previous full total dose  level if they meet the same dose -adjustment criteria listed above.  
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): [ADDRESS_910515] 
at the investigator’s discretion ; general guidance is provided  based on expert recommendations in the 
US and Europe . Detailed information about the brand, starting dosages, and any changes in  oral 
phosphate and active vitamin D therapy  will be determined by [CONTACT_673716] (provided in Section 7.1 and summarized below) and  recorded at every site visit. US 
guidelines generally recommend a calcitriol dosage of 20 to 30 ng/kg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses 
and an elemental phosphorus dose of 20 to 40 mg/kg/day (in 3 to 5 divided doses), acknowledging 
that some children require more, whereas some do well with less (Carpenter et al. 2011 ). 
European  guidelines recommend an alfacalcidol dosage of 1 to 2 µg/day (once daily) and a phosphate 
supplemental dose of 45 to 70 mg/kg/day (in 3 to 4 divided  doses) (Linglart et al. 2014 ). Calcitriol and 
alfacalcidol dosages should be adjusted based on the clinical and laboratory values that guide best 
possible treatment.  
For subjects in Japan and Korea, the Week 64 visit at the end of the Treatment Period will be the End 
of Study (EOS) Visit (“Week 64/EOS I”); subjects in these countries will be enrolled into a separate 
clinical trial of KRN23  or will receive KRN23 through another mechanism . Post-study safety 
follow-up calls and safety visits will occur only for subjects who are not documented to be continuing 
on KRN23 at the Week 64/ EOS I Visit. A safety follow -up telephone call will occur at 5  weeks 
(+5 days) after the Week 64/EOS I Visit to determine if KRN23 therapy has been started in another 
clinical trial or through another mechanism; if KRN23 therapy has not been started, information on 
any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medicat ions will be collected. For subjects who do 
not continue KRN23 therapy, an additional safety visit will occur 12 weeks ±[ADDRESS_910516] required subjects return to the clinic for 
the final safety visit; however, subjects who are unable to return to the clinic for the final safety visit 
will be given the option of providing blood and urine samples as part of a Home Health visit.  
Treatment Extension Period (Weeks 66 – 140) – Subjects in Europe, the US, Canada, and 
Australia  
After completion of the 64 -week Treatment Period, subjects in Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia  
who were randomized to KRN23 will continue treatment with KRN23  at their previous dose and 
regimen in the Treatment Ex tension Period . Subjects in Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia  who 
were randomized  to active control will cross over to receive KRN23 at the starting dose and regimen 
administered to subjects in the KRN23 arm  (starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W; dose may be  increased 
to 1.2 mg/kg Q2W) .  
Before their first dose of KRN23 at Week  66, subjects who were  in the active control arm in the 
Treatment Period will discontinue treatment the day after the Week  64/EOS I visit to allow washout of 
oral phosphate and active vitamin  D treatments. These subjects must have serum phosphorus 
< 3.2 mg/dL (<  1.03 mmol/L) (ie, below the lower limit of normal)  to continue on study and receive 
KRN23 in the Treatment Extension Period.  If hypophosphatemia  is not observed, the subject should be 
retested for serum phosphorus  within a week  to ensure that the test result was not due  to a technical 
issue. If hypophosphatemia  is still not observed after test and retest, t he subject will be discontinued 
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): [ADDRESS_910517] dose of KRN23 in subjects originally assigned to active control will be done 
at the local laboratory so that KRN23 can be administered the same day. A sample will also be drawn 
for a serum phosphorus assessment at the central laboratory.  For subjects crossing over to KRN23 
treatment, the Weeks 66 and 68 visits will be in -clinic visits.  
For subjects in Europe and Australia, the Treatment Extension Period will end in September 2018 , and 
subjects will be enrolled into separate clinical trial s of KRN23  or will receive KRN23 through another 
mechanism . For subjects in the US  and Canada , the Treatment Extensi on Period wi ll end in 
September  2018 and June 2019, respectively,  when commercial KRN23 is expected to be available ; 
subjects will receive commercial KRN23 or will receive KRN23 through another mechanism . Subjects 
leaving the study will have an EOS visit that includes  efficacy assessments (EOS II). Post-study safety 
follow-up calls and safety visits will occur only for subjects who are not documented to be continuing 
on KRN23 at the EOS  II Visit. A safety follow -up telephone call will occur at 5 weeks (+5 days) after 
the EOS II Visit to determine if KRN23 therapy has been started in another clinical trial, as 
commercial product, or through another mechanism; if KRN23 therapy has not been started, 
information on any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications will be collected. For 
subjects who do not continue KRN23 therapy, an additional safety visit will occur 12  weeks ±[ADDRESS_910518] required subjects 
return to the clinic for the final safety visit; however, subjects who are unable to return to the clinic for 
the final safety visit will be given the option of providing blood and urine samples as part of a Home 
Health visit.  
The study will be conducted in a pediatric population . Where possible, measures to minimize pain and 
distress to the subject have been considered for this study protocol including the use of home health 
visits (KRN23 group only) . At every home hea lth visit for subjects in the KRN23 treatment arm, all 
subjects randomized to the active control  arm will receive a phone call to assess adverse events and 
concomitant medications.  Home Health visits are not applicable to subjects in Japan or Korea.  
Where possible, timing of assessments has been coordinated with standard safety laboratory tests to 
minimize risk and discomfort and avoid unnecessary duplication of testing. The primary analysis will 
be at Week 40; analyses at Week 64/EOS I and Week 140 /EOS II will assess the durability of 
treatment effect, additional efficacy outcomes , and long term safety . The end of the study is defined as 
the date of the last protocol -specified procedures (including telephone contact) for the last subject in 
the study.

Assuming a subject meets all other eligibility requirements, the subject may be rescreened 
after a minimum of [ADDRESS_910521](S), DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION :  
KRN23 is a sterile, clear, colorless, and preservative -free solution in single -use 5-mL vials 
containing  1 mL of KRN23 at a concentration of 10 mg/mL or 30 mg/mL. The starting dose will be 
0.8 mg/kg Q2W. The dose may be increased to 1.2 mg/kg at any time during the study if a subject 
meets the following dose -adjustment criteria: 1) 2 consecutive serum phosphorus measurements are 
below the normal range; 2) serum phosphorus has increased by ≤ 0.5 mg/dL from baseline; and 3) the 
subject has not missed a dose o f study drug that would account for the decrease in serum phosphorus.  
The maximum allowable dose of KRN23 per administration is 90  mg. At any time during the study, if 
serum phosphorus increases above the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, the subsequent  dose(s) 
will be withheld and the site will contact [CONTACT_673717]. Once other 
causes of increased serum phosphorus are excluded, KRN23 treatment will resume at half the total 
dose of the last dose received  (ie, half of either 0.8 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg ; maximum dose per 
administration: 40  mg). Serum phosphorus will be followed through unscheduled serum phosphorus 
assessments  (approximately [ADDRESS_910522] -dose and assessed by [CONTACT_2237]; the assessments 
may be repeated as necessary ). A subject will resume dosing at the previous full total dose level if they 
meet the same dose -adjustment criteria listed above. KRN23 will be administered  via subcutaneous

(SC) injection to the abdomen, upper arms , thighs, or buttocks ; the injection site should be rotated with 
each injection.  
ACTIVE CONTROL , DOSE, AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION :  
The first 64 weeks of the study is designed as an open -label comparison with active control ( oral 
phosphate and active vitamin D therapy ). Active control  will be administered on an individualized 
basis at the discretion of the investigator . However, general guidance will be provided  based on expert 
recommendations in the US and Europe  (see Section 7.1 for more information ). The brand, starting 
dosages, and any changes in oral phosphate and active vitamin D therapy will be  determined and  
recorded at every site visit . US expert guidelines generally recommend a calcitriol dosage of 20 to 
30 ng/kg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses and an elemental phosphorus dose of 20 to 40 mg/kg/day (in 3 to 
5 divided doses), acknowledging that some children require more, whereas some do well with les s 
(Carpenter et al. 2011 ). European expert guidelines recommend an alfacalcidol dosage of 1 to 2 µg/day 
(once daily) and a phosphate supplemental dose of 45 to 70 mg/kg/day (in 3 to 4 divided doses) 
(Linglart et al. 2014 ). Calcitriol and alfacalcidol dosages should be adjusted based on the clinical and 
laboratory values that guide best possible treatment.  
DURATION OF T REATMENT :  
Treatment duration will vary by [CONTACT_11338]. The study consists of a Treatment Period (64 weeks) for all 
subjects and a Treatment Extension Period (up to 7 6 weeks) for subjects in Europe, the US, Canada, 
and Australia . For subjects in Japan and Korea, the planned duration of treatment in this study is 
64 weeks, and the Week  64 visit at the end of the Treatment P eriod will be the EOS  I visit. For 
subjects in Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia , the planned duration of treatment is up to 
140 weeks (64 weeks in the Treatment Period and up to 76  weeks in the Treatment Extension period). 
In Europe, the US, and Australia , treatment in the Treatment Extension Period will end by [CONTACT_933] 
2018; in Canada, treatment in the Treatment Extension Period will  end by [CONTACT_11713] 2019 . The duration of 
Treatment Extension Period  will vary for individual subjects and will be determined by [CONTACT_673718] 64/EOS I through the EOS II visit . The maximum duration of treatment is 140  weeks.

(SF-10; for subjects ≥ 5 years of age  at the Screening Visit ) at Weeks 24, 40, and 64  
 Dental evaluation  to assess the number of dental events such as dental caries, tooth extraction, root 
canal, dental abscesses, and gingivitis  
 Pre- and post-prandial serum phosphorus and calcium concentrations at a single visit  
Long-term Assessments  in Treatment Extension Period : 
 At Weeks 88, 112, and 140, e fficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, and exploratory assessments  will be 
conducted as noted in the Schedule of Events.  
Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC that includes members with expertise in metabolic bone disease , cardiology, 
and nephrology,  and the conduct of clinical trials in children will act in an advisory capacity to 
monitor subject safety on a routine basis throughout the trial. The DMC will meet at least twice a year  
during the active -controlled period . The roles and responsibilities of the DMC will be defined in the 
DMC Charter.  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
A full description of the statistical evaluations will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Sample Size : 
This Phase [ADDRESS_910523] 
deviation of 0.50 . Given these assumption , a total sample size of 60 (30 per group) will provide 
approximately 80% power to detect such a difference  in the mean RGI-C global score at Week [ADDRESS_910524] with a 2-sided alpha  level of 0.05 . A 10% drop -out 
rate is incorporated  in the sample size calculation.  
Efficacy Analysis : 
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of assigned 
medication, and the Full Analysis Set will be used fo r both efficacy and safety analyses.  For efficacy 
analyses, subjects will be analyzed by [CONTACT_673720]. The primary efficacy endpoint 
will be tested to compare the mean RGI-C global score between the KRN23 and active control  groups.

At the Week 40 Analysis (the primary efficacy analysis time point), t he primary hypothesis of the 
primary endpoint is to test whether there is a difference between the KRN23 and active control  groups 
in the mean RGI-C global score s at Week 40. An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)  model with 
treatment group  adjusting fo r baseline rickets severity and age  will be used to test this hypothesis at a 
2-sided alpha level of 0.05 . The proportion of RGI -C responder s will be summarized for each 
treatment grou p. 
At the Week 64 Analysis (secondary analysis), RGI-C global score over time will be analyzed using 
the repeat measurement model that includes treatment group, visit, treatment group by [CONTACT_23259], 
and adjusted for baseline rickets severity  and age.  
The change from baseline in RSS total score over time will be analyzed using the same method  as that 
of the RGI -C global score . 
Analyses of other efficacy and PD measures will be per formed at Week 40 , Week 64, and Week  140. 
Endpoints will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_81591]. Treatment comparison will be 
performed using the repeat measurement model including treatment group, visit, treatment group by 
[CONTACT_23259], adjusting for b aseline age, rickets severity. Other baseline covariate s may be 
considered for adjustment.  
Safety Analysis : 
Full Analysis Set will be used for  the safety analysis. Subjects will be analyzed based on the actual 
treatment received.  Safety variables including AEs, SAEs safety laboratory assessments,  vital signs, 
renal ultrasound, ECG, ECHO, and anti-KRN23 antibody will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_1570].

1. All study visits will be scheduled relative to the Baseline visit, with an allowable variance of ±3 days for each visit (with  the exception of the Screening and the 
Safety Follow -up Visits) to accommodate scheduling. All Screening/Baseline assessments and inclusion/exclusion criteria must be satisfied prior to randomization 
and dosing. The Screening Visit window may be up to [ADDRESS_910528] dose administered.  
2. PHEX mutation analysis will be performed in all subjects . Potential subjects with prior confirmation  of a PHEX mutation or variant of uncertain significance  in either 
self or a family member with appropriate X -linked inheritance who meet other eligibility requirements may enroll before screening PHEX mutation results are 
returned. 
3. Patients will be random ized 1:1 to either the KRN23 treatment arm or the active control  arm (oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy).  
4. Active control will be administered at the discretion of  the treating Investigator . Subjects randomized to the active control arm will visit the clinic at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 
16, 24, 32, 40, 52, and 64. Active control will be discontinue d after the Week [ADDRESS_910529] dose of KRN23 at Week 66  for subjects or iginally randomized to active control . 
5. In subjects < [ADDRESS_910530] chart and eCRF. An average of the 3 measurements will be calculated.  Pre-study recumbent length/standing height data 
will be collected as discussed in Section  7.5.1. 
6. Screening results will be treated as Baseline data . 
7. AP knee and PA hand/wrist x -rays will be acquired for all subjects and standing long leg x -rays will be acquired for all qualifying subjects.  Pre-study radiographs will 
be collected as discussed i n Section  7.5.1. 
8. 6MWT will be conducted only for subjects ≥  [ADDRESS_910531] is < [ADDRESS_910532] -baseline visits.  
9. For the PROMIS Pediatric Pain Interference, Fatigue, and Physical Function Mobility scales, the p arent or legal guardian  will complete a Parent/Legal Guardian form 
for subjects ages 5 to < 8 years of age at the Screening Visit . Subjects ≥  8 years of age at the Screening Visit  will complete a  pediatric self -report form . Parent/Legal 
Guardian forms will be used for the duration of the study for subjects < [ADDRESS_910533] ≥  [ADDRESS_910534] is < [ADDRESS_910535] turns 5 during the

assessments are completed  and after the subject has rested for 5 minutes. BP measurements will only be obtained at clinic visits  and only for subjects ≥3 years of age . 
At the Screening Visit and at Baseline , 2 sets of 3 BP measurements will be obtained – the first set will be done at the beginning of the visit and the second set at end 
of the visit after all site procedures are completed . BP measurements should be obtained by [CONTACT_162014] (ie , manually and without using an automated device) dafter 
the subject has rested for [ADDRESS_910538]’s weight collected at in -clinic visits will be the basis of the KRN23 dose calculation until the next in -clinic weight collection.  
16. Adverse events and concomitant medications information will be collected at HH visits for subjects in the KRN23 arm during th e Treatment Period and for all

5 INTRODUCTION  
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a disorder of hypophosphatemia, renal phosphate 
wasting, defective bone minera lization, and impaired growth plate or endochondral 
ossification  caused by [CONTACT_492356] (phosphate -regulating gene 
with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome) , and is the most common form of 
heritable rickets . In the absence of functional PHEX, release of fibroblast growth factor 23 
(FGF23) by [CONTACT_492357] , leading to impaired conservation of phosphate by 
[CONTACT_673722]. FGF23 also suppresses 1,25 -
dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25( OH)2D) production resulting in decreased intestinal absorption of 
calcium and phosphate.  
Chronic hypophosphatemia leads to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, the 
2 major pathologic features of XLH.  Rickets and osteomalacia are both disorders o f bone 
mineralization; however, rickets is a disease of the growth plates specifically characterized 
by [CONTACT_673723], leading to 
reduced growth and skeletal deformities (Shore et al. 2013 ). Osteomalacia occurs in both 
children and adults wherein low levels of phosphorus prevent normal mineralization of 
osteoid, resulting in low bone turnover and poor quality bone (Shore et al. 2013 ). 
Published  data suggest that earlier treatment leads to better outcomes. In retrospective 
studies, children beginning treatment before age 1 had consistently higher z  scores and lower 
alkaline phosphatase levels than children starting treatment later in life (Makitie et al. 2003 ),  
(Quinlan et al. 2012 ). 
There is no available medicine that specifically treats the underlying pathophysiology of 
elevated FGF23 -induced hypophosphatemia in XLH. The most common therapy for pediatric 
XLH patients consists of multiple daily doses of oral phosphate often combined with doses of 
active vitamin D analogs, the most common being calcitriol and al facalcidol. Dosing is 
individualized and depends on tolerability of the phosphate d ose and the age, size, and 
growth of the child. Doses may be further adjusted based on the efficacy response to 
treatment or evidence of secondary complications (Carpenter et al. 2011 ). Treatment is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_673688]. The goal of 
therapy with oral phosphate/active vitamin D  is to sufficiently supplement the body’s pool of 
phosphate to allow mineralization of bone and improve skeletal outcomes; however, because 
supplementation therapy does not address the mechanism of urinary phosphate wasting, 
increasing phosphate through supplemen tation also increases renal phosphate throughput and 
urinary phosphate concentrations, thus raising the risk of nephrocalcinosis. Therefore, an 
opportunity exists for more targeted treatment of XLH by [CONTACT_673724]23 to nor malize serum phosphorus and prevent long term consequences of 
chronic hypophosphatemia.  
Proof-of-concept studies in a relevant murine model support the use of an anti -FGF23 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) as a treatment for XLH. Experiments in both juvenile and  adult 
hypophosphatemic mice provided evidence that treatment with an anti -FGF23 mAb 
normalized or ameliorated many of the characteristic abnormalities associated with XLH

(Aono et al. 2009 ), (Aono et al. 2011 ). KRN23 is a fully human IgG1 mAb  that binds to and 
inhibits FGF23. Th e Sponsor and development partner, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. , Ltd. (KHK) 
are investigating KRN23 as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of XLH, a 
disease distinguished by [CONTACT_492371]23.  
KHK has conducted a series of nonclinical pha rmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK), and 
toxicology studies supporting the investigation of KRN23 in adults and children. 
Four clinical studies  of KRN23  have been completed in adult patients with XLH: 
2 single-dose Phase 1 safety and tolerability studies, a repeat dose Phase 1/2 dose escalation 
study, and an associated treatment extension study. An additional open -label, long-term 
extension study is ongoing. A Phase 2 study  (UX023-CL201) in pediatric XLH subjects aged 
5 to 12 years receiving KRN23 at multiple doses up to 2.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) is ongoing and no new safety concerns have been identified . Studies in 
both adults and children (aged 5 -12 years) wit h XLH have shown that KRN23 increases 
serum phosphorus  and 1,25(OH) 2D levels and ratio of renal tubular maximum reabsorption 
rate of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR).  Initial 40-week data from the 
pediatric Phase [ADDRESS_910554] the more steady levels of serum phosphorus, 
1,25(OH) 2D, and other PD parameters observed with Q2W dosing than with Q4W dosing of 
KRN23. 
Data from the pediatric Phase 2 study were used to  establish the dosing regimen and 
provided information for th e design of the current  Phase 3 study. This Phase 3 study will be 
conducted in children with XLH  (aged 1 to ≤ 12 years)  with confirmed evidence of rickets to 
evaluate the efficacy (ie, improvement in rickets) and safety profile of KRN23 treatment , and 
to compare KRN23  treatment with active control ( oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy). 
In addition, this study will evaluate whether every [ADDRESS_910555] who cross over from active control to KRN23 . 
5.1 Overview of XLH 
XLH is a rare, genetic disorder that is serious, chronically debilitating , and represents an 
unmet medical need. This genetic deficiency is estimated to occur in about 1:20,000 live 
births (Burnett et al. 1964 ), (Imel et al. 2005 ), (Beck-Nielsen et al. 2009 ). XLH is the most 
common inherited form of rickets and the most common inherited defect in renal tubular 
phosphate transport. XLH is transmitted as an X -linked dominant disorder  
(Dixon et al. 1998 ). Mutations resulting in the loss of function of PHEX form the genetic 
basis for XLH (Carpenter et al. 2011 ). More than [ADDRESS_910556] 
been identified in patients with XLH (PHEXdb); however, few definitive correlations have 
been observed between specific mutations and phenotypic severity.  
Protocol Number: UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): [ADDRESS_910557] hypophosphatemia due to excessive FGF23 levels  
(Jonsson et al. 2003 ), (Yamazaki et al. 2002 ); however, the precise mechanism by [CONTACT_673725]23 is complex and not fully understood  
(Carpenter et al. 2011 ), (Rowe 2012 ). FGF23 plays an important role as a specific regulator 
of serum phosphorus; its major function is to reduce serum phosphorus levels by [CONTACT_673726] (Fukumoto 2008 ), (Razzaque et al. 2007 ). 
FGF23 also decreases serum 1,25(OH) 2D levels by [CONTACT_61670] 1 -alpha-hydroxylase activity in 
the kidney, thereby [CONTACT_492374]. Both actions 
by [CONTACT_9266]23 on the tubular reabsorption an d intestinal absorption via vitamin D metabolism 
lead to a decrease in serum phosphorus levels.  
Patients with XLH often present during childhood with rickets due to hypophosphatemia and 
frequently deve lop skeletal abnormalities (eg , bowed legs), impaired g rowth, and short adult 
stature (Tenenhouse et al. 2001 ). As young patients age and pro gress into adulthood, the 
symptom pattern evolves due to decreased phosphate requirements for bone growth. 
Adult XLH patients suffer from bone pain and osteomalacia, increased risk of bone fractures, 
joint abnormalities and joint pain, enthesopathy, and osteoarthritis (Carpenter et al. 2011 ). 
There is a great deal of variability in t he manifestations of XLH. In more severe disease, 
hypophosphatemia leads to decreased mineralization of newly formed bone and rickets. 
Surgical correction of limb deformities is often required  (Santos et al. 2013 ),  
(Zivicnjak et al. 2011 ). 
Although there is no approved therapy for XLH that specifically treats the underlying 
pathophysiology of elevated FGF23 -induced hypophosphatemia. , the most common 
treatment for pediatric XLH patients consists of multiple daily doses of oral phosphate often 
combined with doses of active vitamin D metabolites  (eg, calcitriol and alfacalcidol). General 
guidelines for treatment of children with XLH with oral phosphates and active vitamin D 
therapy are published in both the US and Europe, as described in Table 7.1.1 and Table 7.1.2. 
No consensus exists regarding treatment of adult patients with XLH (Linglart et al. 201 4). 
The use of oral phosphate and vitamin D may be initiated for the treatment of osteomalacia, 
bone/joint pain , and pseudofractures in symptomatic patients, although evidence of efficacy  
in adults is limited (Sullivan et al. 1992 ). Treatment with oral phosphate and active vitamin D  
requires frequent and continued monitoring of patients. Serum and urine mineral metabolites 
levels and imaging studies are required to assess t oxicity and secondary complications, 
including nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, and hyperparathyroidism (Carpenter et al. 2011 ).

5.2 Brief Overview of KRN23 Development  
A brief overview of existing information on KRN23 is prov ided below; a comprehensive 
review of the data is contained in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) provided by [CONTACT_492375]. (Ultragenyx), which should be reviewed prior to initiating the study.  
5.2.1 Brief Description o f KRN23 
KRN23 is a recombina nt human IgG1 monoclonal antibody ( mAb) that binds to and inhibits 
the activity of FGF23. KRN23 is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary dihydrofolate 
reductase -deficient cells. The  secreted KRN23 antibody is recovered from the culture 
medium and purified usi ng a series of chromatographic and filtration steps. Based on the 
amino acid sequence, the predicted molecular mass of KRN23 is approximately 
140 kilodaltons (kDa). Nonclinical studies demonstrated KRN23 possesses high binding 
affinity to the N -terminal do main of FGF23. KRN23 binds to FGF23 from humans, 
cynomolgus monkeys and rabbits, but not to other species tested.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action in XLH  
Patients with XLH have hypophosphatemia due to excessive serum FGF23 levels. FGF23 
reduces serum phosphorus levels by [ADDRESS_910558] mechanisms of action (Fukumoto 2008 ), 
(Razzaque et al. 2007), (Yamazaki et al. 2008 ). The primary mechanism is to inhibit 
phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. The secondary  mechanism is to 
decrease phosphate absorption by [CONTACT_35687] 1,25(OH) 2D 
production in the kidney.  
KRN23 has the potential to block or reduce FGF23 action and improve phosphorus  
homeostasis in XLH patients. KRN23 binds the amino -terminal domain of FGF23 that 
interacts with the FGF -binding portion of the combination FGFR1/Klotho receptor, 
preventing FGF23 from binding to and signaling from its receptor. Both intact and 
fragmented FGF23 polypeptides are immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_460001]23 (Yamazaki et al. 
2008). By [CONTACT_35688]23, KRN23 restores tubular reabsorption of phosphate ( as measured 
by [CONTACT_673727] [TmP/GFR ]) from the kidney and increases the production of 1,25(OH) 2D that also 
enhances intestinal absorption of phosphate. It is expected  that by [CONTACT_673728]23, the underlying cause of XLH , and thereby [CONTACT_673729], KRN23 has the potential to significantly alter the n atural history of the 
disease. 
5.2.2 Nonclinical Studies  
The hypophosphatemic (Hyp) mouse is a murine homologue of XLH with a deletion in the 
3ꞌ region of the PHEX gene (Liu et al. 2007 ), (Perwad et al. 2005 ). In addition to 
hypophosphatemia, rickets , and associated developmental abnormalities, these animals 
display elevated serum FGF23 levels and increased expression of FG F23 in the bone. 
Since KRN23 does not bind murine FGF23, the pharmacological effects of murine 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017  
 
 
 
Confidential  Page 47 
anti-FGF23 mAbs were examined in juvenile and adult Hyp mice (Aono et al. 2009 ),  
(Aono et al. 2011 ). In juvenile Hyp mice, anti -FGF23 treatment corrected hypophosphatemia 
and ameliorated the rachitic bone phenotypes  (Aono et al. 2009 ). In adult Hyp  mice, 
anti-FGF23 treatment increased serum phosphate and 1,25(OH) 2D levels, and increased grip 
strength and spontaneous movement (Aono et al. 2011 ). These studies provide proof -of-
concept that  treatment with antibodies targeting FGF23 may reverse or ameliorate 
characteristic abnormalities associated with XLH.  
KRN23 binds to human, rabbit, and monkey FGF23 with comparable affinities. In a study 
conducted under Good Laboratory Practi ce (GLP) conditions, KRN23 cross -reactivity was 
evaluated against a full panel of human, rabbit (32  tissues), and cynomolgus monkey 
(33 tissues) tissues by [CONTACT_9064]. No specific KRN23 staining was observed 
suggesting untoward direct -effects of KRN23 are not expected in any tissues of normal 
humans, rabbits, or cynomolgus monkeys.  
A series of nonclinical pharmacology, PK, and toxicity studies have been conducted in 
rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys to support the use of KRN23 in adults and children . 
Findings of potential clinical significance and relevance to this protocol are summarized 
below; additional information is provided in the IB.  
 The no adverse effect level (NOAEL) in a 40 -week toxicity study in adult cynomolgus 
monkeys was 0.03 mg/kg KRN2 3 for males and 0.3 mg/kg KRN23 for females. 
The NOAEL in a 40 -week toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys and a 
single-dose study in rabbits was 0.3 mg/kg KRN23.  
 Soft tissue and organ mineralization was a consistent finding associated with prolonge d 
and excessive serum phosphate levels including the kidney where nephrocalcinosis was 
observed at the highest dose tested and reversibility of mineralization could not be 
established.  
 The most prominent pharmacologic actions of KRN23 were dose -dependent c hanges in 
serum inorganic phosphorus and 1,25(OH) 2D in rabbits and juvenile, adult , and pregnant 
cynomolgus monkeys.  
 No gross or histopathological abnormalities were observed at the intravenous (IV) 
infusion sites or subcutaneous (SC) injection sites in th e 40-week repeat dose toxicity 
studies in adult and juvenile cynomolgus monkeys.  
 KRN23 demonstrated consistent and predictable PK behavior in both rabbits and 
cynomolgus monkeys based on the results of single and repeat dose studies where 
exposure was by [CONTACT_492377].  
The NOAEL was the same in juvenile and adult monkeys suggesting no difference in 
sensitivity to the adverse effects of KRN23. The results from single - and repeat -dose 
toxicology studies in rabbits and juvenile, adult and pregnant  cynomolgus monkeys suggest 
the primary toxicological effects of KRN23 are associated with prolonged and excessive

bone biopsy Phase 3 study (UX023-CL304) to evaluate changes in osteomalacia at the tissue 
level with KRN23 treatment  are ongoing. Details of study parameters an d PK, PD, clinical 
efficacy and safety results are provided in the IB.  A Phase 2 dose -finding, pharmacodynamic 
(PD) and safety study in pediatric XLH patients aged 5 to 12 years  (UX023-CL201) and an 
open-label, Phase 2 safety, PD, and efficacy study in 1-to-4-year-old children with XLH 
(UX023-CL205) are also ongoing .  
Data from clinical studies to date are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action: that 
KRN23 blocks FGF23 action, leading to a sustained increase in serum phosphorus levels due 
to increased TmP/GFR and increased intestinal absorption caused by [CONTACT_67191] 1,25(OH) 2D. 
Single and repeat -dose clinical studies indicate SC administration of KRN23 consistently 
increased and sustained serum phosphorus levels and TmP/GFR, without a major impact on  
urine calcium levels or vitamin D metabolism  (Carpenter et al. 2014 ), (Imel et al. 2015 ). 
Data from the long -term extension study in adults suggest KRN23 could provide sustained 
increases in serum phosphorus levels such that improvements in bone physiology, structure , 
and function would be expected  (Imel et al. 2015 ).  
Repeated doses of KRN23 up to 1.0 mg/kg were well  tolerated by [CONTACT_460037] 1/2 dose escalation study and associated treatment extension study  
(Imel et al. 2015 ). In the extension study, serious adverse events (SAEs) reported for 
3 subjects were unlikely to be or were not study drug related: breast cancer, hypertensive 
crisis, and cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078]. Throughout the long -term extension study, 
treatment -related AEs were reported for 14  subjects (63.6%) treated with KRN23 and 
included injection site reaction ( 5 subjects, 22.7%), arthralgia (3 subjects, 13 .6%), restless 
legs syndrome ( 2 subjects, 9.1%), and injection site pain (2 subjects, 9.1%). No discernible 
clinically significant trends of lab abnormalities suggestive of a treatment -related adverse 
effect were noted. Overall, no immunogenicity or patter ns of dose -limiting toxicity have been 
associated with KRN23 treatment.  
Similar to the adult studies, interim analyses from the Phase 2 pediatric study 
(UX023-CL201) showed KRN23 treatment up to 2 mg/kg Q2W or Q4W increased serum 
phosphorus, TmP/GFR, and 1 ,25(OH) 2D levels. A [ADDRESS_910560] 
36 subjects enrolled demonstrated that KRN23 significantly improved rickets  from baseline

to Week 40 by 30% (p=0.0076 ) as assessed by [CONTACT_673730] (RSS), 
with greater improveme nts seen with Q2W dosing (44% reduction; p=0.0126) than with 
Q4W dosing (14% reduction). The greatest improvement was observed in a subset of patients 
(n=18) with clear evidence of rickets at baseline  (baseline RSS ≥1.5) (59% reduction  with 
Q2W dosing and 47% reduction with Q4W dosing; p<0.0001  for both dose groups ). 
Consistency in the rickets results was observed using the Radiographic Global Impression 
of Change (RGI -C; -3=worsening; +3=complete healing), with rickets improving b y 
+1.56 points (p<0.0001) in the Q2W dosing group and by +1.20  points (p<0.0001 ) in the 
Q4W dosing group  at Week 40 . In the subgroup with a baseline RSS ≥1.5 , RGI-C improved 
by +2.0 points ( p<0.0001)  in patients who received Q2W dosing, indicating substantial 
healing of rickets, an d by +1.70 ( p<0.0001)  in patients who received Q4W dosing . 
The 40-week analysis also revealed that the Q4W dosing group showed a peak in serum 
phosphorus at 2 weeks after dosing followed by a decrease in serum phosphorus  levels before 
the next dose (though  remaining above baseline), whereas the Q2W regimen showed stable 
serum phosphorus levels slowly increasing over time. Overall, the dose -response and PD 
results observed in the pediatric study were consistent with the adult XLH data generated to 
date. None  of the subjects had serum phosphorus levels above the normal range in either 
dosing group. Most treatment -related adverse events (AE) were mild, most commonly a 
transient injection site reaction (39%). One child experienced a serious AE and was 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_673689]/muscle pain that improved and continues in the trial. No clinically 
meaningful changes occurred in serum or urine calcium, se rum iPTH, or renal ultrasound.  
5.3 Summary of Overall Risks and Potential Benefits 
KRN23, a fully human mAb that binds an d inhibits FGF23, is being developed as a potential 
therapeutic candidate for XLH, a rare genetic disease characterized by [CONTACT_673731]23. By [CONTACT_460038]23, KRN23 
can restore phosphate, vitamin D, and  bone metabolism homeostasis , and has the potential to 
improve the lives of children with this disorder by [CONTACT_673732], 
radiographic abnormalities, and skeletal deformities, and by [CONTACT_673733] - and joint-related complications of rickets.  
This therapeutic approach directly targets the inh erent dysregulation in XLH (ie , excess 
FGF23). In contrast, supplementation therapy with phosphate a nd/or active vitamin D  is only 
partially effective and carries a significant burden and risk of ectopic mineralization, 
particularly nephrocalcinosis.  
Clinical studies to date have demonstrated that KRN23 treatment blocks FGF23 action and 
leads to a sustai ned increase in serum phosphorus levels due to increased TmP/GFR. 
Increased 1,25(OH) 2D was also observed, as expected, based on the inhibition of the excess 
of FGF23. Bone formation and resorption markers also increased. Interim data in children 
with XLH s uggest that KRN23 treatment also improve s rickets. KRN23 was well tolerated in 
the population studied. No major safety concerns were observed; there was no evidence of 
immunogenicity, and no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) based on 
electrocardiogram (ECG) even though FGF23 levels were increased following KRN23 
treatment. Although ectopic mineralization is a known risk related to XLH disease and is

Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017  
 
 
 
Confidential  Page 50 
exacerbated by [CONTACT_492378]/or active vitamin D  supplementation, KRN23 does not 
appear to be associated with progression of cardiac or renal ectopic mineralization beyond 
the natural course of pre -existing disease.  
KRN23 administered SC Q2W or Q4W as doses up to 2 mg/kg achieved the desired PD 
effect in children and evidence of a clinical effec t in healing rickets, positioning KRN23 as a 
drug that could be administered twice per month by [CONTACT_10530], which is a convenient and 
acceptable therapeutic regimen for a chronic condition.  
In conclusion, KRN23 inhibits the effects of FGF23, restoring ph osphate, vitamin D and 
bone metabolism homeostasis. In children with XLH, interim data suggest that KRN23 
treatment improve s rickets. By [CONTACT_35693]23 and increasing serum phosphorus  levels, it is 
expected that rickets severity in children with XLH will be healed or reduced , leading to 
improved  clinical outcomes  and the quality of life of children with XLH. To date, KRN23 
has a favorable safety profile without evidence of increased ectopic mineralization or other 
concerns associated with the excess of FGF 23. KRN23 has the potential to be an effective 
and safe treatment option for patients with XLH.  
5.4 Study Rationale  
XLH is a disorder of hypophosphatemia, renal phosphate wasting, defective bone 
mineralization , and impaired growth plate or endochondral ossification  caused by 
[CONTACT_492356] (phosphate -regulating gene with homologies to 
endopeptidases on the X chromosome) , and is the most common form of heritable rickets . 
In the absence of functional PHEX, release of FGF23 by [CONTACT_673734]. 
Excess circulating FGF23 impairs conservation of phosphate by [CONTACT_100276] -regulating NaPi-IIa 
and NaPi-IIc in the renal tubule  cells and suppressing 1,25(OH) 2D production, resulting in 
decreased intestinal absorption of calcium and pho sphate. Chronic low serum phosphorus 
levels lead to rickets in children and osteomalacia in both children and adults, the 2 major 
pathologic outcomes of the hypophosphatemia. Rickets is a disorder of open growth plates 
characterized by [CONTACT_673735], 
leading to reduced growth and skeletal deformities. Os teomalacia is characterized by a lack 
of proper mineralization, a prolonged  mineralization  process, and an accumulation of osteoid 
tissue with a c onsequent deterioration of bone remodeling  (Shore et al. 2013 ). 
Although there is no approved therapy for XLH that specifically treats the underlying 
pathophysiology of elevated FGF23-induced hypophosphatemia , the most common t herapy 
for children with XLH consists of multiple daily doses of oral phosphate often combined 
with doses of active vitamin D analogs, the most common being calcitriol and alfacalcidol. 
Dosing is individuali zed and depends on tolerability of the phosphate dose and the age, size, 
and growth of the child. The goal of therapy with phosphate and  active vitamin D is to 
sufficiently supplement the body’s pool of phosphate to allow mineralization of bone and 
improve skeletal outcomes; however, because supplementation therapy does not address the 
mechanism of urinary phosphate wasting, increasing phosphate through supplementation also 
increases renal phosphate throughput and urinary phosphate concentrations, thus rais ing the

risk of nephrocalcinosis. More therapeutic options that are efficacious, safe, and convenient, 
and that target the underly ing pathophysiology of XLH (ie , renal phosphate wasting induced 
by [CONTACT_673713]23 levels) , are needed.  
KRN23 is a recombinant huma n IgG1 mAb that binds to and inhibits the activity of FGF23. 
By [CONTACT_35688]23, KRN23 restores tubular reabsorption of phosphate from the kidney and 
increases the production of 1,25(OH) 2D that enhances intestinal absorption of calcium and 
phosphate (Carpenter et al. 2014 ). It is expected that by [CONTACT_673736]23 -the 
underlying cause of XLH -improving phosphorus  homeostasis, and healing rickets, KRN23 
has the potential to significantly alter the natural history of the disease. A Phase 1 study 
established the PK profile of KRN23. A Phase 1/[ADDRESS_910561] shown 
that KRN23 in single and repeated every 4 week doses up to 1.0  mg/kg was well tolerated by 
[CONTACT_673737]. KRN23 sufficiently increased serum phosphorus levels, such that 
improvements in bone physiology,  structure and function would be expected. These data 
support the initiation of further studies to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of KRN23 in 
children wh o experience the most severe physical and health manifestations associated with 
XLH. Currently, there are no approved treatments and a high unmet medical need in pediatric 
XLH patients.  
Adults and children with XLH have the same underlying defect , but are at a different stage of 
the disease. In childhood, normal phosphorus levels are higher to promote bone formation, 
whereas in adults, the normal range is lower, coincident with reduced demand for bone 
formation. Therefore, smaller, more frequent do sing may be preferred for pediatric 
hypophosphatemic patients to maximize treatment effect without a plateau, to drive serum 
phosphorus levels closer to the normal range , and to minimize the troughs.  
A Phase 2 study (UX023 -CL201) in pediatric XLH subjects  aged 5 to 12 years receiving 
KRN23 at multiple doses up to 2.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W) is 
ongoing and no new safety concerns have been identified. Interim data from the Phase  [ADDRESS_910562] improvement observed with Q2W dosing in those 
subjects with higher rickets severity at baseline. KRN23 treatment  also improved serum 
phosphorus , TmP/GFR , and serum 1,25(OH) 2D levels, consistent with results observed in 
studies of adults with XLH. The 40-week analysis also revealed that the Q4W dosing group 
showed a peak in serum phosphorus at 2 weeks after dosing followed by a decrease in serum 
phosphorus  levels before the ne xt dose (though remaining above baseline), whereas the Q2W 
regimen showed stable serum phosphorus levels slowly increasing over time.  Overall, the 
dose-response, serum phosphorus, and other pharmacodynamic results observed in the 
pediatric study were consi stent with the adult XLH data generated to date. There have been 
no discontinuations from the study for any reason.  Most treatment -related adverse events 
(AE) were mild, most commonly a transient injection site reaction (39%). One child 
experienced a serio us AE and was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_673690]/muscle pain that improved and 
continues in the trial. There have been no deaths or discontinuations from the study for any

reason. No clinically meaningful changes occurred in serum or urine calcium, se rum iPTH, 
or renal ultrasound. The current Phase 3 study will be conducted in  children with XLH 
(aged 1 to ≤12 years) who have radiographic evidence of rickets (≥ 2.0 points RSS total 
score), open epi[INVESTIGATOR_269643], and have received oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy for 
≥ 12 consecutive months (for children ≥  3 years of age) or ≥ 6 consecutive months  (for 
children <  3 years of age), 7 days prior to the Randomization Visit . The design is intended to 
evaluate the efficacy (change in rickets severity) and safety of KRN23 treatment  compared 
with active control  (oral phosphate/active vitamin D  therapy). In addition, this study will 
evaluate whether every 2 week dosing of KRN23  improves growth velocity, restores 
phosphorus  homeostasis , and improves functional outcomes and qua lity of life  in children 
with XLH.   
RGI-C global score at Week 40 was selected as the primary efficacy measure as this endpoint 
directly assesses improvements in rickets, which is the basis for, and correlates with the 
major morbidities patients with XLH s uffer from during their lifespan.

7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
UX023-CL301 is a multicenter, randomized, open -label, Phase 3 study comparing the 
efficacy and safety of KRN23 with the active control ( oral phosphate/active vitamin D 
therapy) in pediatric patients with XLH. The study will b e conducted in children with clinical 
evidence consistent with XLH (aged 1 to ≤ 12 years) , including demonstrated 
hypophosphatemia,  radiographic evidence of rickets (≥ 2.0 points RSS total score ), and 
PHEX mutation or variants of uncertain significance . Patients will also be required to have  
open epi[INVESTIGATOR_673691]/active vitamin D therapy for ≥  12 
consecutive months (for children ≥  3 years of age) or ≥ 6 consecutive months  (for children 
< 3 years of age), 7  days prior to the Randomization Visit . Approximately 60 subjects will be 
randomized 1:1 to receive open -label KRN23 administered by [CONTACT_673738] a total of 64 weeks  in the Treatment Period . Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_673715] (RSS total score  ≤ 2.5 vs > 2.5) and age (<  5 vs 
≥ 5 years). At least 20 subjects aged 1 to <  5 years will be included (approximately 10 in 
each treatment arm ), and no more than 10 subjects between the ages of 1 to < 3 years wi ll be 
enrolled. The age ran ge of eligible subjects will be monitored for enrollment for age 
distribution. No more than 70% female subjects will be enrolled. All subjects will washout of 
oral phosphate and active vitamin  D therapy for 7 days prior to random ization. Subjects 
randomized to KRN23 will remain off of oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy throughout 
the duration of the study.  
Treatment Extension Period (Weeks 66 – 140) – All Subjects 
Subjects assigned to the KRN23 treatment group will receive KRN23 at a starting dose of 
0.8 mg/kg Q2W. The dose may be increased to 1.2 mg/kg at any time during the study if a 
subject meets the following dose -adjustment criteria: 1) 2 consecutive serum phosphorus 
measurements are below the normal range; 2) serum ph osphorus has increased by 
≤ 0.5 mg/dL from baseline; and 3) the subject has not missed a dose of KRN23 that would 
account for the decrease in serum phosphorus.  The maximum allowable dose of KRN23 per 
administration is 90 mg.  At any time during the study, i f serum phosphorus increases above 
the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, the subsequent dose(s) will be withheld and the site 
will contact [CONTACT_673717]. Once  other causes of increased 
serum phosphorus are excluded, KRN23 tre atment will resume at half the total dose of the 
last dose received  (ie, half of either 0.8 mg/kg or 1.2  mg/kg; maximum dose per 
administration: 40  mg). Serum phosphorus will be followed through unscheduled serum 
phosphorus assessments  (approximately [ADDRESS_910563]-dose and assessed by [CONTACT_11378]; the assessments may be repeated as necessary) . A subject will resume dosing at 
the previous full total dose level if they meet the same dose -adjustment criteria listed above.  
Subjects assigned to active control will typi[INVESTIGATOR_673692] D. Because of the variability in the doses and dosing 
frequencies of oral phosphates and active vitamin D therapi[INVESTIGATOR_587642], these 
treatments will be ind ividualized for each subject at the investigator’s discretion, but the

following general guidance is provided based on expert recommendations in the US and 
Europe (in Table 7.1.1 and Table 7.1.2). Detailed information about the brand, starting 
dosages, and any cha nges in oral phosphate and active vitamin D therapy will be determined 
by [CONTACT_673739] . US expert 
guidelines generally recommend a calcitriol dosage of 20 to 30 ng/kg/day in 2 to 3 divided  
doses and an elemental phosphorus dose of 20 to 40 mg/kg/day (in 3 to 5 divided doses), 
acknowledging that some children require more, whereas some do well with less  
(Carpenter et al. 2011 ). European expert guidelines recommend an alfacalcidol dosage of 1 to 
2 µg/day (once daily) and a phosphate supplemental dose of 45 to 70 mg/kg/day (in 3 to 4 
divided doses) (Linglart et al. 2014 ). Calcitriol and alfacalcidol dosages should be adjusted 
based on the clinical and laboratory values that guide best possible treatment.

For subjects in Japan and Korea, the Week 64 visit at the end of the Treatment Period will be 
the End of Study (EOS) Visit ( “Week 64/EOS I”); subjects in these countries will be enrolled 
into a separate clinical trial of KRN23  or will receive KRN23 through another mechanism . 
Post-study safety follow up calls and safety visits will occur only for subjects who are not 
documented to be continuing on KRN23 at the Week 64/EOS I Visit. A safety follow -up 
telephone call will occur at 5  weeks (+5 days) after the Week 64/EOS I Visit to determine if 
KRN23 therapy has been started in another clinical trial, as commercial product, or through 
another mechanism; if KRN23 therapy has not been started, information on any o ngoing or 
new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications  will be collected . For subjects who do not 
continue KRN23 therapy,  an additional safety visit will occur 12 weeks ±[ADDRESS_910564] required subjects return 
to the clinic for the final safety visit; however, subjects who are unable to return to the clini c 
for the final safety visit will be given the option of  providing the blood and urine samples as 
part of a Home Health  visit. 
Treatment Extension Period (Week s 66 – 140) – Subjects in Europe, the US, Canada, 
and Australia  
The purpose of Treatment Extension Period is to continue to provide KRN23 treatment after 
the Treatment Period to subjects in Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia  while also 
continuing to collect lon g-term safety and efficacy data . Safety and efficacy parameters will 
continue to be followed while subjects remain on study and receive treatment. After 
completion of the 64 -week Treatment Period, subjects  in Europe, the US, Canada, and 
Australia who were randomized to  KRN23 will continue treatment with KRN23  at their 
previous dose and regimen in the Treatment Extension Period . Subjects who were 
randomized to active control will cross over to receive KRN23 at the  starting dose and 
regimen administered to subjects in the KRN23 arm  (starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W; dose 
may be increased to 1.2  mg/kg Q2W) .

If hypophosphatemia is not observed, the subject should be retested for serum phosphorus 
within a week to ensure that the test result was not  due to a technical issue. 
If hypophosphatemia is still not observed after test and retes t, the subject will be 
discontinued from the study.  The assessment of serum phosphorus to document 
hypophosphatemia before administration of the first dose of KRN23 in subjects originally 
assigned to active control will be done at the local laboratory so t hat KRN23 can be 
administered the same day. A sample will also be drawn for a serum phosphorus assessment 
at the central laboratory.  For subjects crossing over to KRN23 treatment, the Weeks 66 and 
68 visits will be in -clinic visits.  
For subjects in Europe and Australia, the Treatment Extensi on Period will end in 
September  2018, and subjects will be enrolled into separate clinical trial s of KRN23  or will 
receive KRN23 through another mechanism  (Table 7.1.3). For subjects in the US  and 
Canada, the Treatment Extension Period will end in September 2018  and June 2019, 
respectively,  when commercial KRN23 is expected to be available ; subjects will receive 
commercial KRN23 or will receive KRN23 through another mechanism . Subjects leaving the 
study will have an EOS visit that includes efficacy assessments (EOS II). Post-study safety 
follow-up calls and safety visits will occur only for  subjects who are not documented to be

The study will be conducted in a pediatric population; as such, additional measures including 
an external, independent  DMC have been incorporated into the study design. Where possible, 
measures to minimize pain and distress to the subject have been considered for this study 
protocol including the use of home health visits  (KRN23 treatment arm only) . At every home 
health visit for subjects in the KRN23 treatment arm, all subjects randomized to the active 
control arm will receive a phone call to assess adverse events and concomitant medications. 
Home Health visits are not applicable to subjects in Japan or Korea.  Where possible, timing 
of assessments will be coordinated with standard safety laboratory tests to minimize risk and 
discomfort and avoid unnecessary duplication of testing. The primary analysis will be at 
Week 40; analyses at Week 64 /EOS I and Week  140/EOS II will assess the durability of 
treatment effect, additional efficacy outcomes , and long-term safety. The end of the study is 
defined as the date of the last protocol -specified procedures (including telephone contact) for 
the last subject in the study.

An open-label study design was chosen since blinding such a study would be problematic 
due to the different methods of administration and the individualized nature and frequent 
dose adjustments needed with oral phosphate/active vitamin D  therapy.  
Data from the ongoing pediatric Phase 2 study (UX023 -CL201) helped establish the dose 
regimen and provided information for the design of this Phase 3 clinical trial in children with 
XLH. Interim data from the pediatric Phase 2 study suggested KRN23, administered Q 2W 
at approximately 0.8  mg/kg for 40 weeks, increased serum phosphorus by [CONTACT_5554] 
0.7 mg/dL; increases of > 0.5 mg/dL were seen in 83.3% of subjects . Serum 1,25(OH) 2D 
concentrations and TmP/GFR levels also increased, demonstrating overall improved 
phosphorus homeostasis. The increases in serum phosphorus and 1,25(OH) 2D were sufficient 
to provide substantial healing of rickets. No subjects have experienced serum phosphorus 
levels above the upper limit of normal. The Q2W dosing regimen was chosen for th is Phase [ADDRESS_910567] at the 
investigator’s discretion, but general guidance is provide d based on expert recommendations 
in the US and Europe  as described in Table 7.1.1 and Table 7.1.2.  
The duration of treatment is intended to define whether KRN23 is safe for long -term use and 
provide sufficient insight on sustained clinical effects and improvements in rickets and active 
bone diseas e in pediatric XLH patients . The primary analysis will be at Week 40; analyses at 
Week 64/EOS I and Week  140/EOS II will assess the durability of treatment effect, 
additional efficacy outcomes , and long -term safety. 
Change in rickets as measured by [CONTACT_673719] -C is deemed to be an appropriate primary efficacy 
endpoint in this study since it is the basis for, and correlates with the major morbidities 
patients with XLH suffer during their lifespan. A disease -specific RGI -C scale can be used to 
evaluate treatment -related changes in the severity of rickets and bowing in an individual 
subject. The RGI -C system of evaluating pre - and post- images in a side -by-side comparison 
is also ideal for the evaluation of healing of rickets as it most closel y resembles the approach 
used by [CONTACT_673740]. 
Three pediatric radiologists not affiliated with the conduct of the study  and who are blinded 
to subject number and treatment assignment wi ll be contracted by a central imaging facility 
to perform RGI -C ratings. The ratings will be performed independently using an EDC system 
with the raters having no opportunity to discuss images or compare ratings.  The mean of the 
scores assigned by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_910568] score, an 
RGI-C knee score, and a global RGI -C score.

Amendment 1 (Global): [ADDRESS_910569] whether there is a difference 
between the KRN23 and active control (o ral phosphate/active v itamin D) groups in the mean 
RGI-C global scores at Week 40.  The RSS will serve a s a complementary analysis to the 
RGI-C scale and is the method currently being used in the on going pediatric Phase [ADDRESS_910570] lon g-term safety and efficacy data . 
7.3 Selection of Study Population  
The proposed patient population for this Phase 3 study is pediatric patients with a diagnosis 
of XLH and rickets (as documented by [CONTACT_673741]/wrist radiographs). The  proposed 
key inclusion/exclusion criteria are summarized in Sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2.  
To ensure that appropriate patients are selected, eligibility requireme nts include 
demonstrated hypophosphatemia , radiographic evidence of rickets , and genetic evidence 
consistent with a diagnosis of XLH. PHEX sequence variants will be classified consistent 
with the joint consensus recommendations of the American College of M edical Genetics and 
Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology  (Richards et al. 2015 ). Patients with 
PHEX mutations classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and possibly pathogenic will be 
included. Patients with PHEX variants of uncertain significance will also be included , as was 
recommend ed by [CONTACT_673742]. There are hundreds of variants of the PHEX gene 
and many of these have not yet been fully characterized.  The study also requires patients to 
receive oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy for ≥ 12 consecuti ve months prior to 
screening  (for children ≥  3 years of age) or ≥ 6 consecutive months  (for children <  3 years of 
age), [ADDRESS_910571] open epi[INVESTIGATOR_673693], 
only patients ≤  12 years of age will be included and patients with a Tanner stage 4 or higher  
will be excluded. Limiting the maximum age to 12 years will help to ensure patients’ 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_673694] r ickets and 
growth can be evaluated. Week 40 results (N=36) from Phase 2 Study (UX023 -CL201) 
indicated that to best demonstrate a  treatment effect and maximize the ability to detect 
change, baseline rickets sh ould be clearly evident  radiographically; the mi nimal threshold of 
baseline rickets severity to consistently detect change with treatment based on the current 
UX023-CL201 data is an RSS score of ≥1.5. To ensure that all patients will have significant 
rickets at baseline, the study will include patients with a baseline total RSS of [ADDRESS_910572] been on oral phosphate/active vitamin D treatment for at 
least 12 consecutive months (for children ≥3 years of age) or ≥ 6 consecutive months  (for

children <3 years of age) and have residual disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_673695]23 in a relevant population in which the unmet medical need is very clear. A majority of 
patients with XLH receive treatment within the first 2 years of life. Therefore, the study w ill 
not enroll an y treatment -naïve patients. To ensure the protection and safety of the study 
population, the study excludes patients with evidence of hyperparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, 
and hypercalcemia.  
Females are affected more frequently than males, cons istent with X -linked dominant 
inheritance (Ichikawa et al. 2013 ). However, it is unclear whether the severity of disease is 
affected by [CONTACT_673743]. Therefore, no more than 70% female subjects will be 
enrolled. 
Children with XLH undergo a normal pubertal growth spurt. Post -pubertal height is predicted 
by [CONTACT_094]-pubertal height, indicating that loss of height potential generally occurs prior to 
puberty. Published retrospective data suggest that earlier treatment lead s to better outcomes 
for children with XLH (Makitie et al. 2003 ), (Quinlan et al. 2012 ). Thus, initiation of therapy 
at early ages is recommended to achieve improved height outcomes (Carpenter et al. 2011 ). 
Consequently, children younger than [ADDRESS_910573] 20 subjects aged 1 
to < 5 years will be included (approximately 10 in each treatment arm ). 
The Sponsor has taken reasonable measures to ensure the protection and safety of this 
population. Patients with evidence of tertiary hyperparathyroidism or nephrocalcinosis will 
be excluded. Appropriate pediatric expertise will be available at all trial  sites, and site 
personnel will be focused on minimizing risk, fear, pain and distress during conduct of the 
study.

Subjects may be removed from the study for the following reasons:  
 Occurrence of an unacceptabl e AE 
 An illness that, in the judgment of the investigator or Ultragenyx, might place the subject 
at risk or invalidate the study  
 Pregnancy in subject  
 At the request of the subject, investigator, or Ultragenyx, for administrative or other 
reasons 
 Protocol deviation or noncompliance  
If the reason for removal of a subject from the study is an AE, the AE and any related test or 
procedure results will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed onto the Case 
Report Form (CRF). Each clinically significan t abnormal laboratory value or other clinically 
meaningful abnormality should be followed until the abnormality resolves or until a decision 
is made that it is not likely to resolve. If such abnormalities do not return to normal within 
[ADDRESS_910577] study drug administration.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
A Data Monitoring  Committee (DMC) will be constituted for Study UX023 -CL301 and will 
act in an advisory  capacity to monitor the safety of KRN23 on a routine basis throughout the 
trial (Section 7.6.6). The DMC may provide advice to Ultragenyx to aid in the determination 
of whether study enrollment should be paused or if the study should be stopped. If the 
Sponsor deems it appropriate to restart the trial following an internal safety review, this will 
be done only following approval by [CONTACT_18332].  
Individual subjects who experience any unexpected and possibly, probably, or definitely 
drug-related SAEs ( Section 8.5.3) that represent a change in the nature or an increase in 
frequency of the serious event from their prior medical history will be assessed as to whether 
the subject will continue on the stud y.  
Individual subjects will be monitored for renal ultrasound  (Section 7.5.3). If new or clinically 
significant worsening in mineralization is considered clinically meaningful by [CONTACT_36284]/or sponsor and related to study drug, the subject will be discontinued from 
the study.  
Regulatory Authorities, as well as the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee 
(EC) will be informed s hould unexpected and possibly, probably, or definitely drug -related

decision regarding what actions to take, including whether to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. 
Regulatory Authorities, as well as IRBs/ECs, will be informed if the study is paused or 
stopped. 
7.4 Treatments  
The study drug and reference products are manufactured, packaged, and labeled according to 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations . The Investigation al Product should be 
securely stored under conditions indicated in the IB.  
The amount of investigational product administered will be calculated based on a subject’s 
weight (Section 7.4.1). Treatment with  oral phosphates and active vitamin D will be 
individualized to reflect  real-world clinical practice, but general guidance will be provided  
(Section 7.4.2).  
Selection of doses, dose titration, and dose adjustments for the investigational product are 
described in Section 7.4.4. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_910578]  (KRN23)  
KRN23 is a sterile, clear, colorless, and preservative -free solution in single -use 5-mL vials 
containing  1 mL of KRN23 at a concentration of 10 mg/mL or 30 mg /mL. The starting dose 
will be 0.8 mg/kg Q2W. The dose may be increased to 1.2 mg/kg at any time during the 
study if a subject meets the following dose -adjustment criteria: 1) 2 consecutive serum 
phosphorus measurements are below the normal range; 2) serum  phosphorus has increased 
by ≤ 0.5 mg/dL from baseline; and 3) the subject has not missed a dose of KRN23 that would 
account for the decrease in serum phosphorus.  The maximum allowable dose of KRN23 per 
administration is 90 mg.  
At any time during the study, if serum phosphorus increases above the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) for age, the subsequent dose(s) will be withheld and the site will contact [CONTACT_673745]. Once  other causes of increased serum pho sphorus are 
excluded, KRN23 treatment will resume at half the total dose of the last dose received  (ie, 
half of either 0.8 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg ; maximum dose per administration: 40  mg). Serum 
phosphorus will be followed through unscheduled serum phosphorus a ssessments  
(approximately [ADDRESS_910579] -dose and assessed by [CONTACT_2237]; the assessments 
may be repeated as necessary) . A subject will resume dosing at the previous full total dose 
level if they meet the same dose -adjustment criteria listed abov e.  
Subjects will receive study drug via SC injection to the abdomen, upper arms , thighs, or 
buttocks; the injection site should be rotated with each injection. If the dose level exceeds [ADDRESS_910580] dose administered.

7.4.2 Active Control  (Reference)  Therapy 
The study is designed as an open -label comparison with oral phospha te and active vitamin D 
therapy, which  will be individualized by [CONTACT_673746]’s discretion  based on 
published US and European expert guidelines (Carpenter et al. 2011 ), (Linglart et al. 2014 ) 
(in Table 7.1.1 and Table 7.1.2). It should be noted that while commonly used, oral 
phosphate and active vitamin D therapy are not approved for the treatment of XLH.  
Detailed information about the brand, starting dosages, and any changes in oral phosphate 
and active vitamin D therapy will be determined by [CONTACT_673747] . US expert guidelines gener ally recommend a 
calcitriol dosage of 20 to 30 ng/kg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses and an elemental phosphorus 
dose of 20 to 40 mg/kg/day (in 3 to 5 divided doses), acknowledging that some children 
require more, whereas some do well with less (Carpenter et al. 2011 ). European expert 
guidelines recommend an alfacalcidol dosage of 1 to 2 µg/day (once daily) and a phosphate 
supplemental dose of 45 to 70 mg/kg/day (in 3 to 4 divided doses) (Linglart et al. 2014 ). 
Calcitriol and alfacalcidol dosages should be adjusted based on the clinical and laboratory 
values that guide best possible treatment.  
7.4.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study and sequentially assigned an identification 
number. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive open -label KRN23 by [CONTACT_673748] (IWRS) based on a 
randomization schedule developed by [CONTACT_120620] -party vendor. Randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_673715] (RSS total score ≤  2.5 vs > 2.5) and age (<  5 vs 
≥ 5 years).  
After completion of the 64 -week Treatment Period, subjects  in Europe, the US, Canada, and 
Australia who were randomized to  KRN23 will continue treatment with KRN23 at their 
previous dose and regimen in the Treatment Extension Period. Subjects in Europe, the US, 
Canada, and Australia  who were randomized to active control will cross over to receive 
KRN23 at the starting dose and regimen administered to subjects in the KRN23 arm (starting 
dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W; dose may be increased to 1.2  mg/kg Q2W).  
7.4.[ADDRESS_910581]’s weight.  
As discussed earlier, d ata from the pediatric Phase 2 study suggested KRN23, administered 
Q2W at approximately 0.8 mg/kg for 40 weeks, increased ser um phosphorus by [CONTACT_191457] 0.7 mg/ dL; increases of > 0.5 mg/dL were seen in 83.3% of subjects . The Q2W dosing 
regimen was chosen for this Phase 3 study because it appeared to produce a more stable and 
consistent increase in serum phosphorus levels with less fluctuation over time than the every 
4 week (Q4W) dosing regimen, and a safety profile that  was not substantially different from 
the Q4W dosing regimen.

The duration of treatment is intended to define whether KRN23 is safe for long -term use and 
provide sufficient insight on sustained clinical effects and improvements in rickets and active 
bone disease in pediatric XLH patients. A study duration of 40 weeks, similar to  the Phase 2 
study (UX023 -CL201), is considered sufficient to observe treatment effect on rickets; 
therefore, the primary analys is was established at Week 40. A longer period of [ADDRESS_910582], additional efficacy outcomes , and long -term safety. 
The Treatment Extension Period will provide long -term safety and efficacy data up to 
140 weeks.  
Treatment duration will vary by [CONTACT_11338]. The study cons ists of a Treatment Period (64 weeks) 
for all subjects and a Treatment Extension Period (up to 7 6 weeks) for subjects in Europe, the 
US, Canada, and Australia . For subjects in Japan and Korea , the planned duration of 
treatment in this study is 64 weeks, and the Week  64 visit at the end of the Treatment Period 
will be the EOS  I visit. For subjects in Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia , the planned 
duration of treatment is up to 140 weeks (64 weeks in the Treatment Period and up to 
76 weeks in the Treatm ent Extension period). In Europe and Australia, treatment in the 
Treatment Extension Period will end by [CONTACT_933] 2018, and subjects will be enrolled in 
separate clinical trials of KRN23  or will receive KRN23 through another mechanism . In the 
US and Canada , treatment in the Treatment Extension Period will end by [CONTACT_933] 2018  or 
June 2019, respectively  (expected availability of commercial KRN23) ; subjects will receive 
commercial KRN23 or will receive KRN23 through another mechanism . The duration of 
Treatment Extension Period  will vary for individual subjects and will be determined by [CONTACT_673749] [ADDRESS_910583] protocol -
specified procedures (including telephon e contact) for the last subject in the study . 
7.4.[ADDRESS_910584]’s diet or medication 
schedule unless medically indicated. Investigators may prescribe any concomitant 
medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care, except 
those listed in  Section [IP_ADDRESS]. All concomitant medications taken during the study will be 
recorded in the CRF with indication, dose information, and dates of administration. 
Any changes to concomitant medication will also  be documented.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Medications  
To be eligible for the study, all subjects will undergo a washout period where they will 
discontinue treatment with oral phosphates and pharmacologic vita min D metabolites or 
analogs (e g, calcitriol, doxercalciferol, alfacalcidol , and paricalcitol) for 7 days prior to

7.5 Study Procedures  and Assessments  
7.5.1 Schedule of Events  
The schedule of visits and assessments are provided in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2, and 
Table 2.3. Home Health visits (KRN23 treatment arm only) may be conducted at the 
investigational site depending on the preference of the subject and proximity of the subject to 
the clinic. Refer to the  Study Reference Manual for additional details and a recommended 
schedule of specific assessments.  
Potential subjects will come in to the site for an initial Screening Visit and provide informed 
consent. All subjects will have x -rays (knees and hand/wris t) at the Screening Visit and 
confirmed by [CONTACT_673751]. If radiographic evidence of rickets is not present (ie, RSS total score ≥2.0) , 
the subject will be considered a screen failure. Patients with confirmed rickets who also have 
a PHEX mutation or variant of uncertain significance  in either self or an appropriate directly 
related family member can start the process of weaning from oral phosphate/active vitamin D  
therapy (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and return to the site after [ADDRESS_910586] serum 25(OH)D below the lower limit of normal (16  ng/mL) will need to have the 
levels corrected and , assuming they meet all other eligibility requirements, the subject may 
be rescreened after a minimum of 7 days. Walking ability  (6MWT; for subjects ≥ 5 years of 
age at the Screening Visit ) will be completed at the Screening Visit (for practice)  and at the 
Baseline (Wee k 0) visit; the Baseline 6MWT must be assessed on the same day  that the 
questionnaires are administered . Pain, fatigue, and physical function (PROMIS [Patient-
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ] Pain Interference, Physical Function 
Mobility a nd Fatigue domain scores ; for subjects ≥ 5 years of age at the Screening Visit ); 
pain intensity (Faces Pain Scale – Revised [FPS -R] for subjects ≥ 5 years of age at the 
Screening Visit , and the SF-10 for Children Health Survey (SF -10; for subjects ≥ 5 years of 
age at the Screening Visit ) may be completed at the Baseline visit.   
Historical radiographs of the anteroposterior (AP) knee, posteroanterior (PA) hand/wrist, and 
long leg are of importance and interest to evaluate the presentation and severity of  the 
subject’s XLH disease and rickets severity over time . Available AP knee, PA hand/wrist, and 
standing long leg radiographs taken in the 5 years prior to the Screening Visit will be 
collected; radiographs of other skeletal locations will not be collecte d. Approximately 1 set 
of radiographs  per year will be collected; if there are multiple sets within a year, the set 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): [ADDRESS_910587]’s birthday should be obtained . The wrist and knee radiographs will be 
used to evaluate rickets severity and to determ ine how much rickets fluctuate over time in 
patients who were treated with oral phosphate/active vitamin D prior to study enrollment. 
The standing long leg radiographs will be used to assess changes in genu varum and/or 
valgum following prolonged treatment  with oral phosphate/active vitamin D prior to study 
enrollment. The images will be de -identified and rated using the RSS and RGI -C. 
Similarly, historical growth data are of importance and interest . All available recumbent 
length and standing height data a ssessed prior to the Screening visit will be collected .  
All study visits will be scheduled relative to the Baseline visit , with an allowable variance of 
± 3 days for each visit (with the exception of the Screening and Safety Follow -up Visits) to 
accommodate scheduling.  All Screening/Baseline assessments and inclusion/exclusion 
criteria based on central laboratory results must be satisfied prior to randomization and 
dosing. KRN23 dosing should occur no sooner than [ADDRESS_910588] dose adminis tered. 
Subjects may be monitored between site visits through a series of Home Health visits 
(KRN23 treatment arm only) depending on the preference of the subject and the proximity of 
the subject to t he site. Home Health visits are not applicable to subject s in Japan or Korea.  
The visit window for Home Health  visits is ±[ADDRESS_910589](s) have been performed within [ADDRESS_910590](s) have been 
performed within [ADDRESS_910591]-study safety follow -up calls and safety visits will occur only for subjects who are not 
documented to be continuing on KRN23 at the  Week 64/E OS I Visit or EOS II Visit , as 
appropriate . A safety follow -up telephon e call will occur for these subjects at 5 weeks 
(+5 days) after the Week 64/EOS I visit (in Japan  and Korea ) or after the EOS II visit (in 
Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia ) to determine if the subject is receiving KRN23 
therapy in another clinical trial, as commercial product, or through another mechanism . If 
KRN23 therapy has not been started, information on any o ngoing or new AE s, SAEs, or 
concomitant medications  will be collected . For subjects who do not continue KRN23 
therapy, an additional safety visit will occur 12 weeks ±[ADDRESS_910592] required subjects return to the clinic for 
the final safety visit; however, subjects who are unable to return to the clinic for the final 
safety visit will be given the option of providing blood and urine samples as part of a Home 
Health visit.

7.5.[ADDRESS_910594] of KRN23 on bone health and functional 
outcome in c hildren with XLH. Measures of healing of rickets, growth, and correction of 
skeletal deformity in the legs (including tibial/femoral bowing) will provide an overall 
assessment of KRN23 treatment on bone health. Assessments of walking ability and 
patient/pa rent-reported pain, fatigue, and physical function/mobility  will provide  insight into 
the effect of KRN23 on clinical outcomes.   
Refer to the Study Reference Manual for additional details on clinical efficacy measures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Measurement  
XLH caus es rickets in the wrists and/or knees and other bone abnormalities and the primary 
goals of treatment in children with XLH are to prevent and heal  rickets and radiographic 
abnormalities. The p rimary efficacy endpoint in this study is change in rickets at Week 40 as 
assessed by [CONTACT_673719]-C global score .  
Bilateral AP knee radiographs and bilateral PA hand/wrist radiographs  will be taken at the 
Screening Visit to confirm eligibility and at the Week s 40, 64, 88, 112, and 140/EOS II (or 
Early Termination)  study visits.  Screening radiographs will be read centrally. Standing long -
leg radiographs will be taken at Baseline, Week s 40, 64, 88, 112, and 140/EOS II (or Early 
Termination) . Knee, hand/wrist, and standing long leg radiographs will be taken at Early 
Termination if post -baseline radiographs have not been obtained within 6 months of 
termination. Radiographs will be read centrally and will be interpreted. AP knee and PA 
hand/wrist x -rays will be acquired for all subjects and standing long leg x -rays will be 
acquired for all qualifying subjects.  
The RGI-C utilizes a [ADDRESS_910595]-treatment x -rays with scores ranging from -3 (very much worse or severe worsening of 
rickets or bowing) to +3 (very much better, indicating complete or near complete healing of 
rickets or significant improvement in bowing).  Three pediatric radiologists not affiliated with 
the conduct of the study will be contracted by a central imaging facility to perform RGI -C 
ratings for t he wrist, knee , and long leg images. The [ADDRESS_910596] 
number and treatment assignment . To keep the rad iologists blinded to group (ie , KRN23 
treatment or active control  group), x-ray pairs will be presented for review in random order 
and the radiologists will not be provided access to the protocol, subject identifiers, or 
information related to KRN23 or oral phosphate/active vitamin D  treatment.  The ratings will 
be performed independently using an EDC system with the raters having no opportunity to 
discuss images or compare ratings. For each rating exercise, radiographs are presented 
side-by-side with the earlier image ( baseline) on the left and the later image on t he right.

Radiographs will be taken at  the Screening Visit and  Weeks 40, 64/EOS I, 88, 112, and 
140/EOS II (or Early Termination) . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Measurement s 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Rickets Severity Score (RSS)  
As a complementary measure to the RGI -C, the RSS system is a 10 -point radiographic 
scoring method that was developed to assess the severity of nutritional rickets in the wrists 
and knees based on the degree of metaphyseal fraying and cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_673696] (Thacher et al. 2000 ). With the RSS method, radiograph s of the wrist 
and knee are  scored individually by a central rater who is blinded to subject number , 
characteristics,  and treatment assignment . Radiographs of the wrists and knees will be taken 
at the Screening Visit and  Weeks 40, 64/EOS I, 88, 112, and 140/EOS  II (or Early 
Termination) . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_910597] commonly present in 
childhood with genu varum or genu valgus deformities of the legs from prolonged weight 
bearing. Progressive bowing, knock knees, and antero -medial rotational torsion of tibiae are 
the predomina nt skeletal features of XLH in gr owing children  (Carpenter et al. 2011). 
To assess lower extremity deformity, as well as other disease -specific lower extremity 
abnormalities, standing long leg x -rays will be taken at the B aseline Screening Visit  and 
Weeks 40, 64/EOS I, 88, 112, and 140/EOS  II (or Early Termination if post -baseline x -rays 
have not been obtained within 12 months of termination). Central readings of the standing 
long leg X -rays will be performed and ratings as signed using a disease -specific qualitative 
RGI-C scoring system.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Growth 
Short stature is one of the predominant features in growing children with XLH. Growth of 
the legs and trunk has been shown to be uncoupled in XLH and related to serum phosphate 
levels (Zivicnjak et al. 2011 ). Growth will be measured prior to and following treatment  by 
[CONTACT_673752]  (and percentiles) for subjects ≥ 2 years old or in 
recumbent length (and percentiles)  for subjects <  2 years old . Recumbent len gth will be 
measured in subjects <  2 years old or those unable or unwilling to stand for the measurement.  
Standing height /recumbent length  measurements prior to treatment will be abstracted from 
medical records. Parents will also be asked to report their f inal adult height  and this 
information will be recorded in the CRF . To assess growth during KRN23 treatment, 
standing height /recumbent length  and sitting height  will be measured by a clinical evaluator 
at Baseline and Weeks 24, 40, 64, 76, 88, 100, 112, 124, and 140 (or Early Termination).  
At each time point, heights or recumbent length will be assessed [ADDRESS_910598] s will be collected. Change in growth

100, 112, 124, and 140/EOS  II (or Early Termination) . 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
KRN23 binds to and inhibit s FGF23, which is an important regulator of serum phosphorus 
levels. Serum phosphorus will be measured as a key PD assessment  in this study.  To assess 
the spectrum of KRN23 biological activity on phosphorus  homeostasis and markers of bone 
health, and optimize dose level and regimen, a panel of PD markers will be assessed as 
indicated in the Schedule of Events , including serum PD markers (phosphorus and 
1,25(OH) 2D), markers of phosphate reabsorption (TmP/GFR and TRP), and a bone 
biomarker (ALP) . 
PD parameters will be assessed by [CONTACT_673753]. 
Where possible, PD parameters (serum phosphorus and ALP) will be assessed as part of the 
standard clinical laboratory tests for safet y (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Two-hour fasting urine collection is required to assess phosphate reabsorption (TmP/GFR 
and TRP) based on simultaneous urine a nd blood creatinine and phosphorus concentrations, 
and is applicable in both fasting and non -fasting children  (Payne 1998 ). For subjects 
< [ADDRESS_910600] of the 2-hr urine samples for 
measurements of urinary calcium, phosphorus, and creatin ine. The duration of fasting time 
for all PD parameters will be recorded on the CRF.  
Refer to the study reference manual for additional details on PD parameters.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_910601] (6MWT) will be adminis tered in subjects ≥  5 years of age at the 
Screening Visit at the following study visits:  at the Screening Visit (f or practice), Baseline 
(Week 0), and Weeks 24, 40, 64, 88, 112, and 140  (or Early Termination if post -baseline 
6MWT has not been obtained within 3 months of termination and Early Termination occurs 
at or before Week 140). If a subject is < [ADDRESS_910602] -baseline visits.  The 
6MWT will be administered by a trained clinician. Subjects will be instructed to walk the 
length of a pre -measured course for 6 consecutive minutes. The total distance walked at the 
end of 6 minutes will be r ecorded in meters  (Geiger et al. 2007 ). 
The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) was 
developed by [CONTACT_673754] -specific measures to assess 
patient well -being (Broderick et al. 20 13), (NIH 2015 ). The domain -specific approach is 
based on the idea that health attributes, such a s pain and physical function are not unique to a 
specific disease. The PROMIS contains a bank of questions from which relevant items can be

Function Mobility , and Fatigue do main scores will be administered to  subjects ≥ 5 years of 
age at the Screening Visit . To assess these health domains, items from the Pediatric Pain 
Interference, Physical Function Mobility , and Fatigue  item banks (Version 2.0) were 
extracted to develop a s elf-report form that will be completed by  [CONTACT_7683] 8 years of age and 
older at the Screening Visit . For children ages 5 to <  8 years at the Screening Visit , the same 
items were  extracted from the Parent Proxy item banks (Version 2.0) that will be  completed 
by [CONTACT_85190] . The Parent/Legal Guardian form will be used for the duration 
of the study for subjects <  [ADDRESS_910603] who is > 8 years of age a t Screening has difficulty 
completing the PROMIS self -report, the investigator may allow the PROMIS interview to be 
administered by a trained clinic staff or allow the parent to complete the PROMIS Parent 
Proxy version. The reason should be carefully docum ented and consistent practice of 
administration should be maintained for every visit from Baseline.  The PROMIS Pain 
Interference, Physical Function Mobility , and Fatigue  measurements  will be ad ministered at 
Baseline (Week 0) and Weeks 24, 40, 64/EOS I, 88, 112, and 140/EOS  II (or Early 
Termination ).  
Pain intensity will be self -reported by [CONTACT_673755] – Revised (FPS -R) 
for subjects ≥ 5 years of age at the Screening Visit . The FPS-R is a self-reported measure of 
pain intensity developed for children  (Hicks et al. 2001 ). It was adapted from the Faces Pain 
Scale (Bieri et al. 1990 ) to make it possible to score the sensation of pain on the widely 
accepted 0 -to-10 metric. The FPS -R has been validated for use in children 5 to 16 years of 
age. The FPS-R graphically depi[INVESTIGATOR_673697] 0, 2, 
4, 6, 8, and 10 (0=no hurt; 10=hurts worst) . The FPS-R will be ad ministered at Baseline 
(Week 0) and Weeks 24, 40, 64, 88, 112, and 140  (or Early Termination ).  
[IP_ADDRESS].6 Pharmac okinetic Assessment  
To assess KRN23 concentration and possible accumulation, serum pre -dose levels will be 
evaluated as a PK parameter in this stud y. A pre-dose blood sample will be obtained at 
Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 33, 40, 64/EOS I during the Treatment Period . For each sample 
collection, the time elapsed since last study drug administration will be recorded on the CRF. 
Subjects randomized to active control will not have blood sample s drawn for thi s assessment  
during the Treatment Period; during the Treatment Extension Period, blood samples for 
KRN23 concentrations will be drawn on the same schedule as subjects originally randomized 
to KRN23, ie, Weeks 88, 112, and 140 /EOS II (or Early Termination) . In addition, for 
subjects crossing over to KRN23 during the Treatment Extension Period, a sample for 
KRN23 serum concentration will be drawn at Week 68.

(SAEs), including clinically significant changes from baseline to scheduled tim e points in 
vital signs, weight, interval history and physical examination, eGFR, clinical laboratory 
evaluations (including additional KRN23/XLH biochemical parameters of interes t), and 
concomitant medications. Ectopic mineralization safety assessments include renal ultrasound, 
echocardiogram (ECHO) and ECG , serum calcium and iPTH, and urinary calcium and 
creatinine. The development of anti -KRN23 antibodies and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
will also be assessed. Refer to the Study Reference Manual for  additional details on safety 
assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History 
General medical information includes subject demographics (date of birth, ethnicity, and sex) 
and a history of major medical illnesses, diagnoses, and surgeries. The review will also 
include an assessment of symptoms and conditions associated with XLH  and previous 
treatments (eg, oral phosphate/active vitamin D) .  
Subjects must be willing to provide access to prior medical records for the collection of 
radiographic data, as well as disease histor y. The specific diagnosis of XLH will be recorded, 
along with date of onset, clinical presentation, and date and method of diagnosis. Any 
available family history of XLH will be noted, including any available previous PHEX 
mutation analysis results for the  subject or relevant family members with appropriate 
X-linked inheritance pattern. The height of both parents will also be recorded. 
XLH treatment history and relevant concomitant medications will be recorded (start date, 
stop date, dose, dose regimen). Previous treatments may include calcitriol and oral 
phosphate, calcimimetics, and or other adjunctive therapy. Medications include 
investigational, prescription, over -the-counter, herbal and nutritional supplements. 
Any relevant concomitant therapy, includin g physical/occupational therapy will be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  Including Standardized B lood Pressure Measurement  Procedure  
Vital signs will include seated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure measured 
in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), heart rate in beats per minute, respi[INVESTIGATOR_467847], and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). Blood pressure  (BP) measurements will 
only be obtained at clinic visits  and only in children ≥3 years of age  at the Screening Visit . 
Children who turn 3 years of age during the study will start BP assessments  at the next 
scheduled clinic visit  and continue with subseque nt scheduled BP assessments for the 
duration of the study . The guidance provided by [CONTACT_673756], 
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents  (NIH 2005 ) 
will be used as a reference.  
Vital signs measurements will be obtained at each indicated visit (Table 2.1, Table 2.2, and 
Table 2.3). On the Screening and Baseline Visit, [ADDRESS_910605] set will be done at the beginning of the visit and the second set at end of 
the visit after all site procedures are  completed . BP measurement s should be done after the 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): [ADDRESS_910606] BP until all measurements are obtained.  Clinic BP 
measurements are obtained in the right arm of the study participant. At each study visit, 
before BP dete rmination, arm circumference is measured (in centimeters) with a plastic 
measuring tape at the midpoint of the upper arm between the acromium (tip of shoulder) and 
olecranon (tip of elbow) and a cuff is then selected so that the length of the cuff bladder is 
equal to 80% to 100% of the arm circumference . Effort should be made to use the same BP 
measuring device for BP measur ements during subsequent visits.  
After [ADDRESS_910607], pulse and BP  measurements begin. The cuff  is inflated approximately 
30 mm Hg above the pressure when  the radial pulse is no l onger felt . The BP measurements 
are obtained by [CONTACT_162014]  (ie, manually and without using an automated device)  of the 
brachial artery using the first Korotkoff sound for systolic BP (SBP ) and the fifth Korotkoff 
sound for diastolic BP (DBP). Three BP measurements are obtained at a sitting  and recorded 
in the particip ant’s BP records for the study visit. For the subsequent site visits post -baseline, 
3 BP measurements is recorded during the site visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Echocardiogram  
ECHO will be performed at Baseline and Weeks 40, 64/EOS I, 88, 112, and 140/EOS  II (or 
Early Termination  if not performed within 3 months of termination)  in subjects ≥  5 years of 
age at the Screening Visit . Children who turn 5 years of age during the study will start ECHO 
assessments at the next scheduled clinic visit  and continue with subsequent scheduled E CHO 
assessments for the duration of the study . The goal is to assess for evidence of ectopic 
mineralization in the heart and aorta. Additional tests may be performed if any abnormalities 
are detected or if medically indicated. ECHO administration procedure s will be standardized 
and results will be read centrally by [CONTACT_1146].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Weight  
Weight will be obtained using a scale and recorded in kilograms at  the Screening  Visit, 
Baseline, and at study visits at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 52, 64 /EOS I, 76, 88, 100, 112, 
124, and 140/EOS  II (or Early Termination)  (Table 2.1, Table 2.2, and Table 2.3). 
In addition, for subjects crossing over to KRN23 during the Treatment Extension Period, 
weight will be obtained at Week 68. The subject’s weight collected at in -clinic visits will be 
the basis of the KRN23 dose calculation until the next in -clinic weight coll ection.

[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination  
Complete physical examinations will be performed at the Screening Visit, Baseline, and at 
the study visits at Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 52, 64, 76, 88, 100, 112, 124, and 140 (or Early 
Termination)  and at the Safety Visit (if ap plicable). In addition, for subjects crossing over to 
KRN23 during the Treatment Extension Period, a complete physical exam will be performed 
at Week 68. Physical examinations will include assessments of general appearance; head, 
eyes, ears, nose, and thro at; the cardiovascular, dermatologic, lymphatic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems.  The genitourinary 
exam should be non -invasive, age-appropriate and consistent with the standard of care  
principles of th e Investigator. The primary purpose of the genitourinary exam is to establish 
and monitor Tanner staging over the course of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Ultrasound and Glomerular Filtration Rate  
Renal ultrasounds will be conducted at the Screening  Visit, and Weeks 24, 40, 64/EOS I, 88, 
112, and 140/EOS  II visits (or Early Termination). The ultrasound will be interpreted by 
[CONTACT_673757].  
Baseline and all post -treatment renal ultrasounds will be eval uated by a trained central reader 
blinded to treatment assignment and subject data to evaluate changes in calcifications and all 
other renal abnormalities from baseline (.e , screening assessment). Ultrasonographic findings 
of nephrocalcinosis will be grade d on a 5-point scale  (Verge et al. 1991 ). 
The eGFR will be calculated using the Bedside Schwartz equation (Schwartz et al. 1976 ) for 
determining creatinine clearance.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram  
A standardized 12 -lead ECG will measure PR, QRS, QT, and QTc at Baseline and Weeks 24, 
40, 64/EOS I, 88, 112, and 140/EOS  II (or Early Termination). The goal is to evaluate both 
for left ventricular hy pertrophy (LVH) changes, as well as for changes in conductivity and 
intervals. ECG administration procedures will be standardized and results will be read 
centrally by [CONTACT_673758]. The ECG 
results wi ll be assessed for any clinically significant abnormality or relevant changes from 
baseline. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Tests  for Safety  
A comprehensive serum metabolic panel (Chem -20), complete blood count, and urinalysis 
will be used as routine screens to asses s safety. Certain analytes ( eg, serum phosphorus) in 
the routine Chem -20 panel are also designated as PD/efficacy parameters in this study. 
Additional KRN23/XLH biochemical parameters of interest include serum 1,25(OH) 2D, 
calcium, creatinine, and iPTH; and urinary phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine.

Blood and urine samples will be collected at Screening, Baseline, and regular intervals 
throughout the study as indicated in the Schedule of Events (Table 2.1, Table 2.2, and 
Table 2.3).  
Fasting for a minimum of 4 hours (overnight) is required prior to each blood draw; the 
duration of fasting will be recorded on the CRF. Twenty -four-hour urine collection for 
subjects ≥ 5 years of age is required to assess urinary phosphorus:creatinine and 
calcium:creatinine ratios; urinary phosphorus, a PD parameter will also be obtained from 
24-hour urine samples. Details for blood and urine collection can be found in the  central 
laboratory manual.  
Pre- and post-prandial serum phosphorus  and calcium  concentrations  will be assessed at a 
single visit in approximately 20 subjects (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Clinical laboratory parameters to be assessed for safety are provided in  Table [IP_ADDRESS].1.

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Anti-KRN23 Antibody Testing  
To determine the immunogenicity profile of KRN23 in children with XLH, blood samples 
will be obtained for anti -KRN23 antibody ( anti-drug antibodies [ADA] ) testing at Baseline, 
and at Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 40, 64/EOS I, 88, 112, and 140 /EOS II (or Early Termination). 
The formation of anti -KRN23 antibodies in human serum will be determined using a 
validated ECLA and a 2 -tiered strategy: screening assay and specificity confirmation assay. 
If the development of anti -KRN23 antibodies is suspected in a given subject, samples may be 
obtained at additional time points on a case -by-case basis, if warranted.  Subjects randomized 
to active control will not have blood sample s drawn for this assessment  during the Treatment 
Period; during the Treatment Extension Period, blood samples for ADA will be drawn on the 
same schedule as subjects originally randomized to KRN23, ie, Weeks 88, 112, a nd 
140/EOS II. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Testing  
Female subjects of childbearing potential will have urine pregnancy tests throughout the 
study as indicated in  Table 2.1, Table 2.2, and Table 2.3. Females not of childbearing 
potential are not required to  undergo preg nancy testing , including those who have not 
experienced menarche or are permanently sterile.  
Female subjects of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test at Screening will not 
be enrolled in the study.  
Additional pregnancy tests will be perform ed at any visit in which pregnancy status is in 
question. A serum pregnancy test will be performed in the event of a positive or equivocal 
urine pregnancy test result, or can be performed if pregnancy test by [CONTACT_11864].  
Experience with KRN23 in pregnant women is limited. The study drug may involve risks to a 
pregnant female or unborn baby [CONTACT_435075]. Female participants of child‐
bearing potential must consent to use a highly effective method of contracept ion listed below  
from the period following the signing of the informed consent  through [ADDRESS_910609] consent to use a condom with spermicide or one of the highly effective 
methods of contraception listed below from the period following the signing of informed 
consent through 12 weeks  after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648].  
Highly effective methods of contraception  (CTFG 2014 ) include: 
 Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (eg, oral, intravaginal, transdermal)  
 Progestogen -only hormonal contraceptio n associated with inhibition of ovulation (eg, 
oral, injectable, implantable)  
 Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)

All AEs will be recorded from the time the informed consent is  signed through [ADDRESS_910611]-approval requirements  for safety monitoring, as applicable . 
For subjects not continuing KRN23 treatment under commercial use or another mechanism 
upon completion of study drug treatment or early withdrawal from this study, a Safety Visit 
will be conducted 1 2 weeks ±[ADDRESS_910612] dose of KRN23 in  this protocol.  
The determination, evaluation, reporting, and follow -up of AEs will be performed as outlined 
in Section  8.5. At-each visit, subjects will be asked about any new or ongoing AEs since the 
previous visit. Assessments of AEs will occur at each visit to the investigational site and at 
Home Health Visits  (KNR23 treatment arm only) .  
Clinically significant changes from baseline in phy sical examination findings, vital signs, 
clinical laboratory parameters, renal ultrasounds, eGFR, and ECGs will be recorded as AEs 
or SAEs, if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093] . 
7.5.4 Exploratory Assessment s 
[IP_ADDRESS] Health-related Quality of Life  
Individuals with X LH are affected by [CONTACT_673759]. The SF -10 for Children Health Survey (SF -10) is a 
caregiver-completed questionnaire designed to assess physical and psychosocial 
health-related quality of l ife in healthy and ill children  (Saris-Baglama et al. 2006 ). 
The 10 items were adapted from the Child Health Questionnaire and utilize a 4 -week recall 
period. Responses are used to generate 2 component summary scores: physical summary 
score (PHS -10) and psychosocial summary score (PSS -10). Higher global scores are 
associated with better quality of life. The SF -10 will be administered  in subjects ≥ 5 years of 
age at the Screening Visit during the Baseline visit (Week 0), and Weeks 24, 40, 64/EOS II, 
88, 112, and 140/EOS  II (or Early Terminati on). If a subject is < [ADDRESS_910613] a dministration completes subsequent administrations to 
minimize variability.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dental Evaluation  
Some children with XLH may present with severe dental defects, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_673700] (Carpenter et al. 2011 ). These infections

Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017  
 
 
 
Confidential  Page 84 
are a result of defective dentin and enamel hypoplasia that diminishes the layer surrounding 
the pulp chamber, enabling oral bacteria to enter the pulp chamber and form abscesses.  
Dental evaluations will be conducted to assess the number of dental events from dental 
caries, delay in eruption of the dentition, enamel hypoplasia, dental abscesses, and gingivitis.  
At each clinic visit, an oral examination will be conducted  by [CONTACT_673760], tooth extraction, 
root canal , dental abscesses, and gingivitis.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pre- and Post-prandial Serum Phosphorus  and Calcium  Concentration s 
Substudy  
Pre- and post-prandial s erum phosphorus  and calcium  concentrations will be assessed at a 
single clinic visit  anytime 10 to 14 days after a KRN23  dose. The substudy will be conducted 
at sites in the US, Canada, and Australia that are able to provide and observe a nutritionally 
defined meal in their clinic . The substudy will be conducted in approximately 20 subjects, 
age ≥ [ADDRESS_910614]/caregiver 
asking for participation in the substudy. If agreed, a cli nic visit will be scheduled and the 
subject will be consented at that time and prior to any substudy assessments being conducted. 
The clinic visit may take the place of a Home Health visit or be at a regularly scheduled 
clinic visit . Before the visit at which the  substudy assessments are conducted, subjects must 
have received at least 4 doses of KRN23 (≥  8 weeks of treatment) with at least 80% 
compliance and did not miss the previous dose of KRN23.  
Subjects will fast overnight for a minimum of [ADDRESS_910615] (Table [IP_ADDRESS].1). Meals will contain predefined ranges of phosphate , 
calories, and carbohydrate and will be repre sentative of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_673701] . 
Subjects will have the option of 2 to 3 nutritionally defined  meals (depending on the clinical 
site). Subjects will be given a  1-hour window to consume the meal . Dietary phosphate will be 
estimated based on  the amount of food consumed. Serum samples  will be drawn 1 and 
2 hours after the completion of the meal.

radiographic abnormalities, and skel etal deformities and improve growth outcomes 
(Carpenter et al. 2011 ). KRN23 binds to and inhibits FGF23 . FGF23-mediated 
hypophosphatemia plays leads to rickets in children with XLH. Therefore, change in rickets 
in the KRN23 group will be the primary endpoint in this study.  
Radiographs are routinely recommended during the initial evaluation of XLH, and to 
evaluate healing of rickets and skeletal deformities. Performance measures such as the 
6MWT (≥ 5 years old  at the Screening Visit ) in subjects have been successfully used in other 
clinical development programs.  Additionally, age-appropriate, patient -reported outcome w ere 
included to assess functional disability , pain, and health -related quality of life  (ie, PROMIS 
Pediatric Pain Interference, Fatigue and Physical Function Mobility ; FPS-R; and SF-10 in 
subjects ≥  5 years old  at the Screening Visit ).  
Additional assessments are included both as PD measures and safety indicators of potential 
secondary complication s associated with treatment, including serum phosphorus , serum 
calcium, 1,25(OH) 2D, and urinary calcium  and creatinine, as hypercalciuria may occur in the 
absence of hypercalcemia.  
Intact PTH (iPTH) levels and TmP/GFR are routinely measured as a part of oral 
phosphate/active vitamin D therapy  in XLH, as secondary hyperparathyroidism is commo n.

biomarkers has been included in this Phase [ADDRESS_910618] assessments such as 
recording of medical history, AEs and SAEs, physical examination, vital signs, serum 
chemistry, concomitant medications, and other routine clinical and laboratory procedures. 
Routine, non -invasive procedures will provide relevant indicators of possible renal and 
cardiac risk; renal ultrasounds will be used to detect any calcinosis in susceptible organs. 
Since elevated free FGF23 has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 
patients with chronic kidney disease, ECGs will examine the potential risk in XLH subjects.  
The study will be conducted in a pediatri c population, as such additional safety measures 
including Home Health care visits (KRN23 treatment arm only) and a DMC have been 
incorporated into the study design. Where possible, measures to minimize pain and distress 
to the subject have been considered  for this study protocol.

documentation for on -site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the 
study to at least [ADDRESS_910634] with retention should the 
Investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full 
[ADDRESS_910635] be stored in a secure and safe facility.  
8.5 Reporting and Follow -up of Adverse Events  
8.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, w hether or not considered drug related. An adverse event can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, 
for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) pr oduct, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event c aused by a drug.  
Life-threatening adverse event or life -threatening susp ected adverse reaction is a n adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction that, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, 
places the patient or subject at immediate risk of dea th. It does not include an adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death. 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017  
 
 
 
Confidential  Page 94 
Serious adverse event (SAE) or serio us suspected adverse reaction is a n adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction  that at any dose, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse event  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]  
 Persistent or significant incapacity or disability ( substantial disru ption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
 A congenital anoma ly/birth defect  
Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_673703] e nrollment (eg , for elective surgeries) are 
not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819] -existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs.   
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93203] b e considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
Wherever pos sible, the severity of all AEs will be graded using the  National Cancer Institute  
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) version 4.0  (NCI 2010 ). 
The majority of AEs can be graded using this system.  
If an AE cannot be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded as mild, moderate, 
severe, life -threatening, or death using the following definitions.  
 Mild (Grade 1):  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of a minor 
irritant type, causing no loss o f time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require 
therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are tr ansient. 
 Moderate (Grade 2):  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_11884]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with  
functioning.  
 Severe (Grade 3):  Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.  
 Life-threatening (Grade 4):  Events that place the participant at  immediate risk of death 
or are disabling.  
 Death (Grade 5):  Events that result in death.  
Protocol Number: UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017

To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
"serious" and "severe," which are not synonymous, the following note  of clarific ation is 
provided. The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may 
be of relatively minor medical significa nce (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"serious" which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as 
a guide for defining regulato ry reporting obligations.  
8.5.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the 
following descriptions.  During the Treatment Period, the relationship of the AE to KRN23 
will be assessed  for subjects in the KRN23 arm, and the relationship of the AE to oral 
phosphate and to active vitamin D will be assessed  for subjects in the active control arm.  
During the Treatment Extension Period, t he relationship of the AE to KRN23 will be 
assessed. 
Categories of attributions for “ Unrelated” events:  
 Unrelated: This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure . 
 Unlikely Related:  This category applied to an AE that is doubtfully related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure.  
Categories of attributions for “Related” events:  
 Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that may be related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure . 
 Probably Related:  This category applies to an AE that is likely re lated to the 
investigat ional agent/procedure .  
 Definitely Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure . 
For the purposes of reporting to regulatory agencies, AEs deemed as Definitely, Probably or 
Possibly Related will be considered Related and those deemed Unrelated  or Unlikely Related 
will be considered Unrelated.  
8.5.4 Adverse Event Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS] General 
All AEs (ie, any new or worsening in severity or frequency of a preexisting condition) with 
onset after the subject signs consent for study participation must be promptly documented on 
the CRF. The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs, obtaining supp orting 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): [ADDRESS_910636] 
include severity, relationship to study drug, duration, and outcome.  
For subjects not continuing KRN23 treatment under commercial use or another mechanism 
upon completion of study drug treatment or early withdrawal from this study, a Safety Visit 
will be conducted 1 2 weeks ±[ADDRESS_910637] a comment in the 
source document by [CONTACT_528639], recovered wit h sequelae, or 
stabilized.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Drug Reactions, and 
Requirements for Immediate Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee must be notified of the occurrence of a ny SAE that occurs  during 
the reporting period within 24 hours of  the Investigator, designee, or site personnel’s 
knowledge of the event. SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_673765].  
Follow-up SAE information must be submitted in a timely manner as additional information  
becomes available. All SAEs regardless of relationship to study drug must be followed to 
resolution or stabilization if improvement is not expected.  
All deaths, regardless of causality,  occurring from signing of the informed consent until 
[ADDRESS_910638] dose of study drug are to be reported as SAEs  to Ultragenyx or 
its designee within 24 hours of knowledge . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy in Subject or Partner , and Requirements for Immediate 
Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee must be notified of the occurrence o f any pregnancy in a subject 
or subject’s partner that occurs  during the reporting period within 24 hours of the 
Investigator, designee, or site personnel’s knowledge of the event. Pregnancies will be 
reported by [CONTACT_673766]. Reported pregnancy of a subject or a subject’s partner, while participating in the 
study, will be monitored for the full duration and/or followed until the outcome of the 
pregnancy is known. In the event of a pregnancy in the partner of a subject, the Investigator 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL301 
Amendment 1 (Global): 03 November 2017  
 
 
 
Confidential  Page 97 
should make every effort to obtain the female partner’s consent for release of protected 
health information.  
Ultragenyx or its designee must be notified of the outcome of the  pregnancy within 24 hours 
of the Investigator, designee, or site personnel’s knowledge of the outcome. Pregnancy 
outcomes will be reported by [CONTACT_673767].  
Any pregnancy-associated SAEs must be repor ted as per the SAE reporting process indicated 
in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
8.5.5 Communication Plan  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Drug Reaction  Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee will submi t suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) to appropriate Regulatory  Authorities (in cluding Competent Authorities in  all 
Member Sta tes concerned), EC s, and Investigators as per local laws and regulations. 
Fatal and life-threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs wil l be submitted no later than [ADDRESS_910639] knowledge of the event. 
Ultragenyx will use th e current KRN23 Investigator’s Brochure to evaluate expectedness for 
SAEs occurring in the KRN23 treatment group. Ultragenyx will use applicable product label s 
(Appendix 1 ) to evaluate expectedness for SAEs occurring in the active control treatment 
group (oral phosphate and active vitamin D).  
The Investigator will notify the IRBs/Research Ethics Boards (REB)/ECs of SAEs, in 
accordance with IRB/REB/EC requirements and local laws and regulations. A copy of this 
notification must be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Urgent Safety Matters and Non -S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting  
Principal Investigators are required to report any urgent safety matters to Ultragenyx or its 
designee within 24 hours. Ultragenyx or its designee will inform the Regulatory Authorities, 
ECs, and Investigators of any events (e g, change to the safety profile of KRN23, major safety 
findings) that may occur during the clinical trial that do not fall within the definition of a 
S[LOCATION_003]R but may affect the safety of subjects participating in the clinical tr ials, as required, in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The reporting period for urgent safety 
issues is the period from the signing of the ICF through [ADDRESS_910640] dose of 
study drug.  
The Investigator will notify the IRBs/  REB/ECs of urgent safety matters, in accordance with 
IRB/REB/EC requirements and local laws and regulations. A copy of this notification must 
be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee.

11 APPENDIX  1: REFERENCE SAFETY INFO RMATION FOR THE ACTI VE 
CONTROL ARM  
The attached SmPCs serve as RSI for the oral phosphate and active  vitamin D products used 
in the active control arm of this study  at clinical sites in Europe . For regulatory reporting 
purposes, the information located in Section 4.8 of the following SmPCs will be used to 
determine if a serious adverse event is unexpecte d for the applicable compound.  
Alfacalcidol – One-Alpha®  
Calcitriol – Rocaltrol®  
Oral Phosphate – Phosphate Sandoz® 
 
Confidential    SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS 
 
[ADDRESS_910644] 
 
One-Alpha Capsules 0.5 microgram. 
 
 
2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANT ITATIVE COMPOSITION 
 
Alfacalcidol 0.5 μg 
 
 
 
3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
 
Red soft gelatin capsules.   
   
4 CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
 
4.1 Therapeutic indications 
 
One-Alpha® is indicated in all conditions where there is a disturbance of 
calcium metabolism due to impaired 1-ct hydroxylation such as when there is reduced renal function. The main indications are:  a) Renal osteodystrophy b) Hyperparathyroidism (with bone disease) c) Hypoparathyroidism d) Neonatal hypocalcaemia e) Nutritional and malabsorp tive rickets and osteomalacia 
f) Pseudo-deficiency (D-depende nt) rickets and osteomalacia 
g) Hypophosphataemic vitamin D resi stant rickets an d osteomalacia 
 
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
 
Route of administration: oral 
 Initial dose for all indications:  Adults: 1 microgram/day 
Page 105
 
Confidential    Dosage in the elderly: 0.5 microgram/day 
Neonates and premature infant s: 0.05 - 0.1 microgram/kg/day 
Children under 20 kg bodyweight: 0.05 microgram/kg/day 
Children over 20 kg bodyweight: 1 microgram/day 
 
The dose of One-Alpha® should be adjusted thereafter to avoid 
hypercalcaemia according to the bioche mical response. Indices of response 
include plasma levels of calcium (id eally corrected for protein binding), 
alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, as well as radiographic and histological investigations.  Plasma levels should initially be measured  at weekly intervals. The daily dose 
of One-Alpha
® may be increased by [CONTACT_122271] 0.[ADDRESS_910645] adult patients respond to doses between 1 and 3 micrograms per day. 
When there is biochemical or radiogra phic evidence of bone healing, (and in 
hypoparathyroid patients when normal pl asma calcium levels have been 
attained), the dose generally decreases. Maintenance doses are generally in the 
range of 0.25 to 1 microgram per day. If hypercalcaemia occurs, One-Alpha
® 
should be stopped until plasma calcium returns to normal (approximately 1 
week) then restarted at half the previous dose.  
(a)  Renal bone disease: 
 
Patients with relatively high initial plasma calcium levels may have autonomous hyperparathyroidism, often unresponsive to One-Alpha
®. Other 
therapeutic measures may be indicated.  Before and during treatment with One-Alpha
®, phosphate binding agents 
should be considered to prevent hype rphosphataemia. It is particularly 
important to make frequent plasma calcium measurements in patients with chronic renal failure because prolonged hypercalcaemia may aggravate the decline of renal function.  
(b)  Hyperparathyroidism: 
 
In patients with primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism about to undergo 
parathyroidectomy, preopera tive treatment with One-Alpha
® for 2-[ADDRESS_910646]-operative hypocalcaemia, One-Alpha
® should be continued until plasma al kaline phosphatase levels fall to 
normal or hypercalcaemia occurs.  
(c)  Hypoparathyroidism: 
 
In contrast to the response to parent v itamin D, low plasma calcium levels are 
restored to normal relatively quickly with One-Alpha
®. Severe hypocalcaemia 
is corrected more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_673704]-Alpha® (eg 3-5 
micrograms) together with calcium supplements.

4.2 Posology and method of administration 
 
The dose of Rocaltrol should be carefully adjusted for each patient according to the 
biological response so as  to avoid hypercalcaemia. 
 The effectiveness of treatment depends in part on an adequa te daily intake of calcium, 
which should be augmented by [CONTACT_673768].  The 
capsules should be swallowed with a little water.  Adults 
Renal Osteodystrophy 
The initial daily dose is 0.25 mcg of Roca ltrol.  In patients with normal or only 
slightly reduced calcium levels, doses of 0.25 mcg every other day are sufficient.  If 
no satisfactory response in the biochemical pa rameters and clinical  manifestations of 
the disease is observed within 2 - 4 weeks, the daily dosage may be increased by 0.25 mcg at 2 - 4 week intervals.  During th is period, serum calcium levels should be

Confidential    All other vitamin D compounds and their derivatives, including proprietary 
compounds or foodstuffs which may be “f ortified” with vitamin D, should be 
withheld during treatment with Rocaltrol. 
 An abrupt increase in calcium intake as a result of changes in diet (e.g. increased consumption of dairy products) or uncontro lled intake of calcium preparations may 
trigger hypercalcaemia.  Pa tients and their families should be advised that strict 
adherence to the prescribed diet is mandatory and they should be instructed on how to recognise the symptoms of hypercalcaemia.  As soon as the serum calcium levels rise  to 1 mg/100 ml (250 µmol/l) above normal 
(9-11 mg/100 ml or 2250-2750 µmol/l), or se rum creatinine rises to >120 µmol/l, 
treatment with Rocaltrol should be stopped immediately until normocalcaemia ensues 
(see section 4.2).  Immobilised patients, e.g. those who have  undergone surgery, are particularly 
exposed to the risk of hypercalcaemia.  Calcitriol increases inorganic phosphate levels in serum. Wh ile this is desirable in 
patients with hypophosphataemia, caution is ca lled for in patients with renal failure 
because of the danger of ectopic calcification.  In such cases, the plasma phosphate level should be maintained at the normal level (2-5  mg/100 ml or 0.65-1.62 mmol/l) 
by [CONTACT_673769]-binding agents and low phosphate 
diet.   The serum calcium times phospha te (Ca x P) product should not be allowed to exceed 
70 mg
2/dl2. 
 Patients with vitamin D-resistant ricket s (familial hypophosphataemia) who are being 
treated with Rocaltrol must continue their oral phosphate therapy. However, possible stimulation of intestinal absorption of phosphate by [CONTACT_673770]. 
 Since calcitriol is the most effective vitamin D metabolite available, no other vitamin D preparation should be prescribed during treatment with Rocaltrol, thereby [CONTACT_673771] D is avoided. 
 If the patient is switched from a long acting vitamin D preparation (e.g. ergocalciferol (vitamin D
2) or colecalciferol) to calcitriol, it may take several months for the 
ergocalciferol level in the blood to return to the baseline value, thereby [CONTACT_673772] (see section 4.9).  Patients with norma l renal function who are taki ng Rocaltrol should avoid 
dehydration.  Adequate fluid intake should be  maintained. 
 In patients with normal rena l function, chronic hypercalcaemia may be associated 
with an increase in serum creatinine.  
 Rocaltrol capsules contain sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose 
intolerance should not take Rocaltrol capsules. 
Page [ADDRESS_910652] be dete rmined with care in patient s undergoing treatment with 
digitalis, as hypercalcaemia in such patients may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_673706] (see section 4.4).   A relationship of func tional antagonism exists between vitamin D analogues, which 
promote calcium absorption, and cor ticosteroids, which inhibit it. 
 Magnesium-containing drugs (e.g. anta cids) may cause hypermagnesaemia and 
should therefore not be taken during therap y with Rocaltrol by [CONTACT_673773].  Since Rocaltrol also has an effect on phosphate  transport in the intestine, kidneys and 
bones, the dosage of phosphate-binding agen ts must be adjusted in accordance with 
the serum phosphate concentration (nor mal values: 2-5 mg/100 ml, or 0.65-1.62 
mmol/l).  Patients with vitamin D-resistant ri ckets (familial hypophosphataemia) should 
continue their oral phosphate therapy. Ho wever, possible stimulation of intestinal 
phosphate absorption by [CONTACT_673774].  Bile acid sequestrants including cholestyra mine and sevelamer can reduce intestinal 
absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and therefore may impair intestinal absorption of calcitriol.

Investigations    Blood creatinine increased  
 
Since calcitriol exerts vitamin D activity, adverse effects may occur which are similar 
to those found when an excessive dose of vitamin D is taken, i.e. hypercalcaemia 
syndrome or calcium intoxication (depe nding on the severity and duration of 
hypercalcaemia) (see sections  4.2 and 4.4). Occasional acute symptoms include 
decreased appetite, headache, nausea, vomitin g, abdominal pain or abdominal pain 
upper and constipation. 
Because of the short biological half-life of calcitriol, pharmacokinetic investigations 
have shown normalisation of el evated serum calcium within a few days of treatment 
withdrawal, i.e. much faster than in treatment with vitamin D3 preparations. 
Chronic effects may include muscular weakness, weight decreased, sensory 
disturbances, pyrexia, thirst, polydipsia,  polyuria, dehydration, apathy, growth 
retardation and urinary tract infections. 
In concurrent hypercalcaemia and hype rphosphataemia of > 6 mg/100 ml or > 1.9 
mmol/l, calcinosis may occur; this can be seen radiographically.  Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, erythema, pruritus and urticaria may occur 
in susceptible individuals.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Page [ADDRESS_910656] is 
important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal 
product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions 
via the Yellow Card Scheme website: www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard. 
  
4.9 Overdose 
 
Treatment of asymptomatic hy percalcaemia (see section 4.2). 
 
Since calcitriol is a derivative of vitamin D,  the symptoms of overdose are the same as 
for an overdose of vitamin D. Intake of high doses of calcium and phosphate together with Rocaltrol may give rise to similar symptoms. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca x P) product should not be allowed to exceed 70 mg
2 / dl2. A high 
calcium level in the dialysate may contri bute to the development of hypercalcaemia. 
 Acute symptoms of vitamin D intoxi cation: anorexia, headache, vomiting, 
constipation. Chronic symptoms: dystrophy (weakness, loss of weight), sensory disturbances, possibly fever with thirst, polyuria, dehydration, apathy, arrested growth and urinary tract infections. Hypercalcaemia ensues, with metastatic calcification of the renal cortex, myocardium, lungs and pancreas.  The following measures should be considered  in treatment of accidental overdosage: 
immediate gastric lavage or induction of vomiting to prevent further absorption. Administration of liquid paraffin to pr omote faecal excretion. Repeated serum 
calcium determinations are advisable. If elevated calcium levels persist in the serum, phosphates and corticosteroids may be administered and measures instituted to bring 
about adequate diuresis.  Hypercalcaemia at higher levels (>3.2 mmo l/L) may lead to renal insufficiency 
particularly if blood phosphate  levels are normal or elevated due to impaired renal 
function.  Should hypercalcaemia occur following prolonged treatment, Ro caltrol should be 
discontinued until plasma calcium levels have returned to normal.  A low-calcium diet will speed this reversal.  Rocaltrol can then be restarted at a lower dose or given in the same dose but at less frequent intervals than previously.  In patients treated by [CONTACT_673776], a low concentration of calcium in the dialysate may also be used.   However,  a high concentration of calcium in the 
dialysate may contribute to the development of hypercalcaemia. 
  
Page [ADDRESS_910657] cell types and functioning as a ligand-activated 
transcription factor that binds to DNA sites to modify the expression of target genes.  Rocaltrol is a synthetic prepar ation of calcitriol.  Oral ad ministration of Rocaltrol to 
patients with chronic rena l failure compensates for impaired endogenous production 
of calcitriol which is decreased when the glomerular filtration rate falls below 30 
ml/min.  Consequently, intes tinal malabsorption of cal cium and phosphate and the 
resulting hypocalcaemia are improved, thereby [CONTACT_673777].  In patients with establis hed post-menopausal osteoporos is, Rocaltrol increases 
calcium absorption, elev ates circulating levels of calcitriol and reduces vertebral 
fracture frequency.  The onset and reversal of the effects of Ro caltrol are more rapid than those of other 
compounds with vitamin D activity and adjustment of the dose can be achieved sooner and more precisely.  The effects of inadvertent overdosage can also be 
reversed more readily.  
 
 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
 
Absorption 
Calcitriol is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_673707]. Peak serum concentrations following 
a single oral dose of 0.25-1µg Rocaltrol in healthy subjects were found within 2-6 
hours.  After a single oral dose of 0.5 mcg Rocaltrol  in healthy subjects, the average serum 
concentrations of calcitriol rose from a baseline value of 40.0 ± 4.4 pg/ml to 60.0 ± 
4.4 pg/ml after two hours, and then fell to 53.0 ± 6.9 after four hours, to 50.0 ± 7.0 
after eight hours, to 44 ± 4.6 after twelve  hours and to 41.5 ± 5.1 pg/ml after 24 hours. 
  
Distribution 
During transport in the blood at physiological concentrations, calcitriol is mostly 
bound to a specific vitamin D binding protein (DBP), but also, to a lesser degree, to 
Page 119
 
Confidential    lipoproteins and albumin.   At higher blood calcitriol concentrati ons, DBP appears to 
become saturated, and increased binding  to lipoproteins and albumin occurs. 
 
Metabolism 
Calcitriol is hydroxylated and oxidised in the kidney and in the liver by a specific 
cytochrome P450 enzyme: CYP24A1.  Several metabolites with different degrees of vitamin D activity have been identified. 
 
Elimination 
The elimination half-life of calcitriol in plasma ranges between [ADDRESS_910658] 
dose range and up to 165 µg single oral dose. Calcitriol is excreted in the bile and may 
undergo an enterohepatic circulation 
5.3 Preclinical safety data 
 
Subchronic toxicity studies in rats and do gs indicated that calcitriol at an oral 
dose of 20 ng/kg/day (twice the usual human dosage) for up to 6 months 
produced no or minimal adverse effects.  A dose of 80 ng/kg/day (8 times the usual human dosage) for up to 6 months produced moderate adverse effects; changes seen appeared to be primarily the result of prolonged hypercalcaemia. 
 
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats indicated that oral doses up to 300 ng/kg/day (30 times the usual human dose) did not adversely affect reproduction.  In rabbits, multiple foet al abnormalities were observed in two 
litters at an oral maternally toxic dose of 300 ng/kg/day and one litter at 80 ng/kg/day, but not at 20 ng/kg/day (twice the usual human dose).  Although there were no statistically significant  differences between treated groups and 
controls in the numbers of litters or foetuses showing abnormalities, the possibility that these findings were due to calcitriol administration could not be discounted.

PHOSPHATE SANDOZ® Effervescent Tablet 
 
2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANT ITATIVE COMPOSITION 
 
PHOSPHATE SANDOZ Effervescent Tabl ets containing 1.936g of sodium 
acid phosphate anhydrous. 
 
 
 
3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
 
Effervescent Tablets 
  
 
 
 
4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
 
4.1. Therapeutic Indications 
 Hypercalcaemia associated with such conditions as hyperparathyroidism, multiple myelomatosis and malignancy.  Hypophosphataemia associated with vitamin  D resistant rickets and vitamin D 
resistant hypophosphataemic osteomalacia.   
 
4.2. Posology and Method of Administration 
 
PHOSPHATE SANDOZ Efferv escent should be dissolved in 1/3 to 1/2 a 
tumblerful of water and taken orally.  Dosage should be adjusted to suit the requirements of indi vidual patients.  
Excessive dosage has been reported to  produce hypocalcaemia in isolated 
cases.  Particular care should therefore be taken to ensure appropriate dosage 
in the elderly.  
Adults
 
 
Hypercalcaemia : up to 6 tablets daily (adjustment being made according to 
requirements). 
 
Page 123
 
Confidential    Vitamin D resistant hypophosphateaemic osteomalacia: 4-6 tablets daily. 
 
Children under 5 years  
 
Hypercalcaemia : up to 3 tablets daily (adjustment being made according to 
requirements). 
 Vitamin D resistant rickets: 2-3 tablets daily.   
 
4.3. Contra-Indications 
 
None. 
 
 
 
4.4. Special Warnings and Special Precautions for Use 
 
In cases of impaired renal function associated with hypercalcaemia and in 
cases where restricted sodium intake is required, eg. congestive cardiac failure, hypertension or pre-eclamptic toxaemia , the sodium (20.4mmol per tablet) and 
potassium (3.1mmol per tablet) cont ent of PHOSPHATE SANDOZ should be 
taken into consideration.  In cases of hypercalcaemia associated with impaired 
renal function and hyperphospha taemia, the main effect of oral phosphate is to 
bind calcium in the gut and t hus reduce calcium absorption. 
 The effect of oral phosphate on serum phosphate is likely to be minimal, but 
close monitoring of serum levels is recommended.  Soft tissue calcification and nephrocalcinosis have been  reported in isolated 
cases following intravenous therapy with phosphate. 
 
This is thought to be a function of dosage and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_673709].  While such effects appear less likely to occur with oral phosphates, careful surveilla nce of patients is recommended, especially if on 
long term therapy. 
  
 
4.5. Interactions with ot her Medicinal Products and other Forms of 
Interaction 
 
Concurrent administrations of antacids, containing agents such as aluminium 
hydroxide, may result in displacement of calcium from binding to oral 
phosphate, thus reducing efficacy. 
  
 
4.6. Pregnancy and Lactation

product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions 
via the national reporting system in the [LOCATION_008]: Yellow Card Scheme 
Website:   www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard
 
 
 
 
4.9. Overdose 
 
Excessive dosage has been reported to  produce hypocalcaemia in isolated 
cases.  This has proved reversible when dosage has been adjusted. 
  
 
 
 
5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
 
5.1. Pharmacodynamic Properties 
 
Oral administration of inorganic phospha tes produces a fall in serum calcium 
in patients with hypercalcaemia.  PHOSPHATE SANDOZ Effervescent Tablets also contain sodium ions whic h aid the correction of the dehydration 
and sodium depletion se en in hypercalcaemia. 
  
 
5.2. Pharmacokinetic Properties 
Page [ADDRESS_910664]; most of the absorb ed phosphate is then filtered by [CONTACT_673778].  Parathyroid hormone and 
vitamin D stimulate absorption of phospha te from the small intestine and its 
reabsorption from the proximal tubule.  Virtually all absorbed phosphate is 
eventually excreted in the urine, the remainder being excreted in the faeces. 
  
 
5.3. Pre-clinical Safety Data 
 
PHOSPHATE SANDOZ Effervescent Tabl ets contain sodium acid phosphate, 
anhydrous, sodium bicarbonate and pota ssium bicarbonate (all of which are 
subject to pharmacopoeial monographs).  The physiological, pharmacological 
and clinical toxicity of potassium salts  are well documented and limited animal data are therefore available.

Proprietary and Confidential Page 2 CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX003-CL202 Amendment 1  
18 Decemb er 2015  
Original Protocol UX003-CL202 (dated 28 October 2014) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] 1 to remove or clarify certain procedures  and update information. 
The introductory nonclinical and clinical background information contained within Section 5 
has also been updated  for completeness ; additional minor edits and typographical corrections 
have also been made. The major protocol changes which impact study design and conduct 
are summarized below:  
1. Administrative and Contact [CONTACT_7171] : The protocol has been updated to 
provide the EudraCT number (2015-001875-32) for the study. The Medical Monitor has been changed to [CONTACT_11890]; contact [CONTACT_11828] ( Section 8.5.8). 
2. Study Population:  Inclusion criterion #7 ( Section 7.3.1
) has been modified to clarify 
UX003 treatment naïve subjects the elevated uGAG excretion must be a minimum of 
2-fold over mean normal levels for age (at baseline). Inclusion criteria # [ADDRESS_11198] 
been combined; UX003 naïve participants must be at least 5 years of age at enrollment.   
3. Study Visit Schedule:   The Early Termination Visit is now referred to as the 
Termination Visit. Visit qualifiers have been modified such that if a subject withdraws from the study, or if the study is terminated prior to Week 144, the 
termination visit should be completed within [ADDRESS_11199] dose of study drug.  Assessments performed within 30 days of the termination visit will not be repeated unless clinically indicated . 
Rationale:  The modification clarifies procedures in case the study is terminated early 
by [CONTACT_1034]. The 30 day window for assessments eliminates unnecessary testing and procedures for subjects. 
4. Study Procedures and Assessments : Several updates have been made to clarify or 
remove procedures in Section 7.5 and the associated Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1). 
Language regarding the assessments to be performed throughout this extension study   has been broadened for applicability to subjects who may enroll from additional feeder trials with UX003. In general, ef ficacy assessments not performed during the 
primary (or feeder) trial will not be required for this  long-term treatment and  
extension study ; safety assessments will be conducted on all subjects as indicated in 
the protocol. M odifications to specific study procedures and assessments specified in 
the protocol text are summarized below. 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 3 Urinary and serum GAG : Serum GAG will no longer be assessed in the study. 
References to the specific methodologies for measurement of GAG in urine and 
serum have been removed from the protocol (Sections 7.5.3 and [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Rationale : Based on clinical and nonclinical evidence, uGAG is a direct 
pathophysiological and readily measured marker of the MPS disease process and a 
reasonable predictor of treatment effect and clinical benefit . Urine GAG is the 
primary measure of ERT efficacy i n MPS disorders and will continue to be followed 
during this long- term extension study.  Multiple assays for measuring pathologic 
accumulation of GAG in urine are now available ; supplementary assays may be 
performed . Removal of serum GAG assessments reduces  the number of required 
blood draws.  
Weight for Drug Preparation: Weight for drug preparation may now be obtained up 
to 15 days prior to the indicated visit. Weight for drug preparation was removed from 
the Termination Visit procedures (Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Table 2.1).  
Rationale:   Obtaining weight up to 15 days prior to the indicated visit will provide a 
measure of convenience for study personnel and subjects by [CONTACT_11829]. Weight for drug preparation is not required at Termination as no study drug will be administered at the visit.  
Biomarkers of Inflammation in Serum:  The frequency of serum biomarker 
assessments has been reduced from 12-week intervals to 24- week intervals 
throughout the study. A qualifier has been inserted to perform if indicated based on prior studies ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Table 2.1).  
Rationale: The utility of assessing of biomarkers of inflammation in understanding 
the action of UX003 in MPS 7 has not been established. An exploratory (pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]) study is ongoing to assess biomarkers of inflammation in MPS 7 patients. The 24- week 
interval reduces the frequency of additional blood draws for study participants.   
Physician Clinical Global Impression:   The P-CGI has been removed as an 
assessment in the study.  
Rationale:   Baseline (pre-treatment) P -CGI assessments  would have been conducted 
more than 1 year prior to UX003-CL202 enrollment for the majority of study subjects; continuing assessments are of limited utility due to likely  recall 
inaccuracies . The open-label design of the study also limits objectivity for this 
assessment.    
Hepatosplenomegaly: The frequency of q ualitative assessments of the liver and 
spleen has been reduced from 12-week intervals to 48- week intervals except for naïve 
patients (Section [IP_ADDRESS]); the assessment is now specified separately from physical 
examinations in Table 2.1. 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 4 Rationale:  The frequency of hepatosplenomegaly assessments has been modified to 
align with the frequency of liver and spleen size assessment  (hepatosplenomegaly) in 
other Ultragenyx -sponsored UX003 clinical studies (i.e. 48 weeks). 
5. Reporting and Follow- up of Adverse Drug Events: The following modifications to 
Section 8.5 provide additional guidance and alignment with AE reporting 
requirements,  primarily:  
• Additional text was added to clarify that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11789] (Section 8.5.1).  
• The categories for attributions of AE relatedness to study drug have been simplified  (Section 8.5.3).  
• A new section ( Section 8.5.6) has been added to provide direction on the 
reporting requirements for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) to appropriate Regulatory Authorities (including Competent 
Authorities in all Member States concerned), IRBs/ECs, and Investigators as 
per local laws and regulation

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX003-CL202 Amendment 2 
04 March  2016  
Protocol UX003 -CL202 Amendment 1 (dated 18 October 2015) has been m odified by 
[CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_11200] are summarized below:  
1. Study Design and Methodology: The protocol has been updated to remove reference to  
availability of commercial drug in the subject’s territory as a reason for study 
termination.  In addition “end of trial” has been defined in Section  7.5.[ADDRESS_11201] would define the end of the trial.  
Rationale:  This change and additional clarification were made in response to a request by 
[CONTACT_11830], the Portuguese Competent Authority and to align with current guidelines. 
2. Study Population: Inclusion criterion #2 ( Section 7.3.1) has been updated to clarify that 
written informed consent by a legally authorized representative may be provided for 
subjects, including adult subjects, who are intellectually impaired.  
Inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_11202] of examples 
of highly effective methods of contraception ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) has been updated to 
remove barrier methods and include bilateral tubal occlusion. 
Inclusion criterion #5 has been updated to remove tubal ligation as a reason that female 
subjects would be considered not of childbearing potential and to clarify the definition of 
those considered not of childbearing potential:  Females considered not of childbearing potential include those who have not experienced menarche, are postmenopaus al (defined 
as having no menses for at least 12 months) or are permanently sterile due to having hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or bilateral ooph orectomy . 
Rationale: Changes to inclusion criteria were requested by [CONTACT_11830], the Portuguese Competent Authority . As many patients with MPS [ADDRESS_11203] intellectual impairment, the 
change to inclusion criterion #2 will clarify that a legally authorized representative may consent on their behalf. Changes to contraception and pregnancy testing lang uage were 
made to align with the Heads of Medicines Agencies Clinical Trial Facilitation Group 
(CTFG) Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical 
trials. 
3. Pregnancy  During Study . Section [IP_ADDRESS] has been updated to indicate that female 
subjects who become pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from study drug . At

Amendment 2:  [ADDRESS_11204] or partner through resolution of the pregnancy (delivery or termination) and report the resolution to Ultragenyx or its designee. 
Rationale:  There are no adequate and wel l-controlled studies in pregnant women using 
UX003 and the effect of study drug on pregnancy and the fetus is unknown. Therefore, 
female subjects who become pregnant will be withdrawn from study drug but will 
continue to be followed on study. Given that MP S [ADDRESS_11205] Retention : Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_11206] 25 years after the end of the clinical trial or in accordance with national law.  
Rationale: This administrative change has been made to reflect upcoming changes to EU clinical trial regulations and current regulations by [CONTACT_11831] .

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX003-CL202 Amendment 3 
28 July 2016 
  
Protocol UX003-CL202 Amendment 2 (dated 04 March 2016) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] 3 to clarify certain procedures and update information. The protocol changes are summarized below:  
1. Title Page. The title page has been updated to list Paul Harmatz, MD, as the 
Coordinating Investigator. 
Rationale:  Ultragenyx nominated [CONTACT_11891], the Principal I nvestigator at the 
UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11790], [LOCATION_004], as the Coordinating 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11791] . 
2. Pregnancy Testing and Contraception . The description of highly effective methods of 
contraception ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) has been updated to clarify that hormonal contraceptives 
should be associated with the inhibition of ovulation.  
Rationale: Changes to inclusion criteria w ere requested by [CONTACT_11830], the Portuguese 
Competent Authority. 
3. Criteria for Evaluation : Measurement of Anti -Drug Antibody (ADA) Types. ADA 
testing, as one of the safety assessments (primary o bjective [Section 7.5.2]), has been 
clarified to indicate that clinically significant changes from baseline in levels of all anti -
drug antibodies, not only the immunoglobulin G ( IgG) isotype, will be evaluated.  
Rationale: Text was updated to provide clarification that all anti-drug antibodies, not 
only IgG antibodies will be assessed, because it was deemed unclear in Amendment 2 . 
This is not a change to the ADA testing . 
4. Serum Biomarkers of Inflammation . Blood for analysis of serum biomarkers of 
inflammation (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will not be collected after Week 48.  
Rationale: Preliminary results from clinical study UX003-CL201 suggest that analysis of 
serum biomarkers of inflammation  did not demonstrate meaningful differences upon 
treatment with UX003 ; therefore, cont inuation of this blood collection into the extension 
study was deemed unnecessary . 
5. Bruininks -Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOT -2). This test of motor 
proficiency (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will not be conducted after Week  48.  
Rationale: Continuing to perform the BOT-[ADDRESS_11207]  will reduce the burden to subjects  
and investigational sites participating in the study.  
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL202  
Amendment 3:  28 JUL 2016  
 
 
 
Confidential Page 4 
6. Childhood Health Assessme nt Questionnaire (CHAQ) . The person responsible for 
completing the CHAQ has been clarified as the subject’s parent or caregiver  
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Rationale: Text was updated to clarify the person responsible for completing the CHAQ, 
because the questionnaire was designed to be completed by [CONTACT_423]’s parent or caregiver rather than the subject . 
7. Health Assessment Questionnaire  (HAQ). The mode of administration of the HAQ and 
the persons permitted to complete the HAQ have bee n clarified  (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Rationale: Text was updated to clarify that the HAQ may be administered to the subject via interview if the subject is deemed unable to complete a paper questionnaire. Also dependent on the abil ity of the subject, a parent or caregiver may complete the 
HAQ. 
8. Record Retention . Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_11208] retention.  
Rationale: Text was updated to clarify that it is not the explicit responsibility of Ultragenyx t o assist with records retention .

2 SYNOPSIS  
TITLE OF STUDY:  
A Long-Term Open -Label Treatment and Extension Study of UX003 rhGUS Enzyme Replacement 
Therapy in Subject s with MPS 7 
PROTOCOL NUMBER : 
UX003-CL202 
STUDY SITES:  
Multi-center; multi- national; approximately 12  sites globally 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 3 
RATIONALE:  
Mucopolysaccharidosis type 7 (MPS 7, Sly syndrome) is an ultra- rare (< 10 0 cases currently identified 
worldwide), chronically debilitating and life threaten ing lysosomal storage disease. It is characterized 
by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase (GUS), required for degradation of the  
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs): dermatan sulfate (DS) , chondroitin-6- sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate 
(HS). The GUS deficiency results in lysosomal accumulation of GAGs in multiple tissues and organs 
throughout the body and numerous clinical signs and symptoms as a result of tissue damage and organ 
dysfunction. There are currently no approved treatments for MPS 7.   
UX003 (recombinant human beta glucuronidase, rhGUS) is intended as a long- term enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of MPS 7 via intravenous (IV) administrati on. 
Ultragenyx is conducting this treatment and extension study to assess the long- term safety and efficacy 
of UX003 treatment in subject s with MPS 7. Subjects with MPS [ADDRESS_11209] been previously enrolled and treated with UX003 in other clinical studies  or programs are 
eligible for enrollment. 
The study will continue for up to 144 weeks or until one of the following occurs: the subject  
withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject  is discontinued from the study at the 
discretion of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, or the study is terminated.   
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate:  
• Long-term safety of UX003 in subject s with MPS 7. 
The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate:  
• Long-term efficacy of UX003 in reducing urinary GAG (uGAG) substrate in subjects with 
MPS 7. 
Other objectives of the study are to evaluate:  
• Measures of lysosomal storage including hepatosplenomegaly  
• Measures of other clinical and functional outcomes, including pulmonary function, walking 
distance, shoulder flexion, fine motor function, gross motor function, climbing stairs, visual 
acuity, and  cardiac size and function, and a composite Multi -Domain Responder Index (MDRI),

• Growth, as defined by [CONTACT_11832] (or length) and 
weight growth velocity . 
• Subject-reported disability and quality of life, and fatigue , as indicated.  
• Subject or parent/ caregiver global assessment  of change  and impac t on activities of daily living , 
as indicated . 
• If an individual ized clinical response (ICR) endpoint was defined for a subject from a previous 
UX003 study, the ICR may continue to be followed. 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY :  
This is a multi -center, multinational, open- label treatment and extension study in subjects with MPS 7.  
The study will assess long-term safety and efficacy of UX003 treatment and will continue for up to 
144 weeks or until one of the following occurs: the subject  withdraws consent and discontinues from 
the study, the subject  is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, 
or the study is terminated.  
Subjects with MPS [ADDRESS_11211].  Subjects with MPS 7 who were enrolled in 
either an Ultragenyx sponsored study (e.g., UX003-CL301) o r non-Ultragenyx sponsored clinical 
studies (e.g., Investigator sponsored trials (ISTs), expanded access/compassionate use) may be eligible for enrollment. Those subjects enrolling from a previous UX003 study should have a reasonable 
benefit-risk assessmen t from their primary study as determined by [CONTACT_737], in order to 
continue with long-term therapy in this extension study. To be enrolled, subjects need to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
All subjects will receive 4 mg/kg UX003 every other w eek (QOW) unless data from prior studies 
define a different dose either for that subject or the use of UX003 in general.  As has been observed with other MPS ERTs, some subjects may experience infusion-associated 
reactions (IARs) wit h the administration of UX003. Thus, prophylactic antihistamine will be 
administered prior to each study drug infusion. Antipyretic pretreatment may also be given at the 
Investigator’s discretion. To minimize the potential for IARs, infusions will initially be administered 
on a slower  rate schedule followed by [CONTACT_11833].  Infusion rate may be slowed to manage or 
reduce IARs.  
Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on physical examinations, clinical laboratory 
analyses, and reporting of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse ev ents (SAEs).    
Evaluations of efficacy, including uGAG levels, 6- minute walk test (6MWT), pulmonary function 
testing, shoulder flexion, visual acuity, and fine and gross motor function will be performed according 
to the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1 and Section 7.5
) if age appropriate and subject is able to perform. 
Additional assessments will be performed , as indicated,  to assess serum biomarkers of inflammation , 
3-minute stair climb test (3MSCT), hepatosplenomegaly, growth velocity, cardiac size and function, 
ICR endpoint (if appropriate), patient-reported outcomes, and subject/parent/caregiver global 
impression of change . The termination visit should be completed by [CONTACT_11834] [ADDRESS_11212] 
dose of study drug.  Efficacy assessments performed within 30 days will not be repeated at the 
termination visit.  If the termination visit occurs after Week 48 , blood for serum biomarkers of

NUMBER OF SUBJECTS PLANNED :  
Approximately 20 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS 7, who are UX003 treat ment-naïve or 
were previously treated with UX003 in either an Ultragenyx-sponsored study or a non- Ultragenyx 
sponsored study  (e.g., IST). 
DIAGNOSIS AND CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION :  
Individuals eligible to participate in this study must meet all of the following inclusion criteria:  
1. Confirmed diagnosis of MPS [ADDRESS_11213] glucuronidase enzyme assay 
or genetic testing.  
2. Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent or, in the case of subjects under the age of 18 (or 16 years, depending on the region) or subjects who are intellectually  
impaired, provide written assent (if required) and written informed consent by a legally authorized representative after the nature of the study has been explained, and prio r to any 
research-related procedures.  
3. Willing to comply with all study procedures. 
4. Sexually active subjects must be willing to use a highly-effective method of contraception 
while participating in the study and for [ADDRESS_11214] not experienced menarche, are postmenopaus al 
(defined as having no menses for at least 12 months without an alternative medical cause) or 
are permanently sterile due to having hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or bilateral 
oophorectomy . 
6. For UX003 treatment -naïve subjects only,  apparent clinic al signs of lysosomal storage disease 
as judged by [CONTACT_737], including at least one of the following: enlarged liver and spleen, joint limitations, airway obstruction or pulmonary problems, limitation of mobility 
while still ambulatory.  
7. For UX003 t reatment-naïve subjects only, at least 5 years old at time of enrollment and with  
elevated u GAG excretion at a minimum of 2-fold over  the mean normal levels for age (at 
baseline). 
Individuals who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eli gible to participate in the 
study: 
1. If enrolled in a prior UX003 clinical study , the subject experienced  safety-related event (s) in 
the prior UX003 clinical study  that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator a nd sponsor, precludes 
resuming UX003 treatment.  
2. Undergone a successful bone marrow or stem cell transplant or has any degree of detectable 
chimaerism with donor cells.  
3. Presence or history of any hypersensitivity to rhGUS or its excipi[INVESTIGATOR_11792], in the judgment of the Investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects.  
4. Pregnant or breastfeeding at Baseline or planning to become pregnant (self or partner) at any 
Protocol Number:  UX003-CL202 
Amendment 3:  [ADDRESS_11215] (drug or device or 
combination) within [ADDRESS_11216](S), DOSE , AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION :  
UX003 is a sterile liquid buffered saline formulation of rhGUS that contains enzyme at a concentration 
of 2 mg/mL filled to allow the withdrawal of a 5.0 mL deliverable volume and supplied in a 10 mL 
glass vial. UX003 will be administered QOW by [CONTACT_11835] 4 hours.  
Infusions will be administered on a rate schedule involving a slower infusion rate initially followed by [CONTACT_11836]; the infusion rate may be slowed to manage or 
reduce IARs.   
REFERENCE THERAPY(IES), DOSE , AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION :  
No reference therapy will be administered in th is study. 
DURATION OF TREATMENT :  
The planned duration of treatment in this study is up to 144 weeks or until one of the following occurs: the subject  withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject  is discontinued from the 
study at the dis cretion of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, or the study is terminated.  
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION:  
Primary Objective : 
Safety will be evaluated in all subjects by [CONTACT_11837], including 
clinically significant changes from baseline to scheduled time points in: 
• Physical examination findings  
• Vital signs and weight  
• Echocardiogram (E CHO) findings 
• Clinical laboratory evaluations  
• Concomitant medications 
• Antibodies to rhGUS 
• Complement C3, C4 and CH50 levels (as indicated) 
Adverse Physi ology Related Group Safety Reporting 
Adverse Physiology Related Group (APRG) reporting is a novel method synthesizing safety symptoms 
into multi-domain physiology related groups to capture IAR information. APRG reporting will be used 
to detect adverse phys iologies that might be expressed variably within and between subjects in a study 
Protocol Number:  UX003-CL202 
Amendment 3:  [ADDRESS_11217] AE reporting will still be conducted in addition to the APRG.   
Management of Infusion Associated Reactions (IARs)  
As has been observed in other MPS enzyme therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], some subjects may experience IARs associated 
with the administration of UX003. Consequently, appropriate measures have been incorpo rated into 
the study design in order to prevent, monitor and manage potential reactions. These measures include prophylactic premedication of subjects with antihistamine, and staged and controlled infusion rates to 
mitigate the potential for IARs. 
Secondar y Objective : 
• Urinary GAG excretion:  First morning void urine will be evaluated for uGAG concentration 
and normalized to urinary  creatinine concentration.  
Other Objectives : 
For the purposes of this study, efficacy assessments listed below which were not performed during the 
primary or feeder study will generally not be required  for this long-term treatment and  extension 
study; safety measures will be assessed in all subjects. UX003- naïve subjects will be required to 
complete all of the following assessments (as appropriate ). 
• Biomarkers of inflammation in serum:  Blood samples will be collected  through Week 48 to 
evaluate levels of biomarkers of inflammation and response to treatment.  
• Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT):  The total distance walked (meters) in a six-minute period 
will be measured.  The percent of predicted normal distance walked based on published normative data will also be determined . 
• Bruininks -Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOT -2):  This test of motor proficiency will 
be administered through Week 48 to evaluate treatment-related changes in four domains 
assessing both fine and gross motor function: fine motor precision, manual dexterity , balance, 
running speed and agility.  The test may be modified and tests omitted to accommodate the 
needs of the subject . 
• Three Minute Stair Climb Test (3MSCT) :  The number of stairs climbed within a three -minute 
period will be assessed . 
• Pulmonary function testing (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]): Spi[INVESTIGATOR_11793] a tracheostomy.  Pulmonary function variables 
include forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV). 
• Shoulder flexion maximum range of motion:  Goniometry will be used to measure (in degrees) 
the maximum passive shoulder r ange of motion in both flexion and extension and compared to 
known normal standards for age. 
• Growth (anthropometric): Growth will be assessed by [CONTACT_11838] (or recumbent length or sitting height if applicable)  and weight. Growth 
velocity will be calculated and compared with pre- treatment growth velocity when available.  
• Visual acuity  will be measured using a standard eye chart and recorded for each eye 
independently. 
• Multi-domain responder index (MDRI) : consisting of the six-minute walk test ( 6MWT), the 
Bruininks -Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOT-2; fine motor  and gross motor function ),

enrolling from the Ultragenyx -sponsored MPS [ADDRESS_11218] was previously selected from the possible clinical outcome measures, 
the same ICR identified in the primary (or feeder) study may continue to be followed in this 
study. 
• Scoring of Impactful Clinical Problems: T he three most impactful clinical problems as 
reported by [CONTACT_423]/parent/caregiver during the Clinical Problem Evaluation will be 
scored on a Likert scale.  For U X003 treatment- naïve subjects, the initial Clinical Problem 
Evaluation wi ll occur at the Baseline visit.  For subjects enroll ing from the Ultragenyx -
sponsored MPS 7 Phase 3 clinical study UX003-CL301, the Clinical Problems identified during the UX003-CL301 Randomization visit will continue to be scored throughout this 
study. 
• Subject-reported disability, quality of life , and fatigue:  The MPS Health Assessment 
Questionnaire, Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ), or Health Assessment 
Questionnaire (HAQ) will be administered to evaluate treatment- related changes in self -care 
and mobili ty activities of daily living. The age-appropriate Pediatric Quality of Life 
Multidimensional Fatigue Scale (Peds QL -Multidimensional Fatigue Scale) will b e 
administere d to evaluate treat ment-related changes in fatigue. 
• Subject/Parent/Caregiver Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale :  Subjects or 
parents/caregivers will provide a global assessment of change using a CGI scale. In addition, subjects or parents/caregivers w ill provide narratives of their perception of how treatment has 
impacted the subject’s ability to complete activities of daily  living.   
• Hepatosplenome galy:  Liver and spleen measurements will be assessed by [CONTACT_3971].

Confidential Page 24 5 INTRODUCTION 
Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders caused by 
[CONTACT_11843] ( GAGs). Although many of the characteristics are similar among the 
mucopolysaccharidoses, each disease is a distinct entity arising from de ficiency of a specific 
enzyme. MPS 7 (Sly syndrome) is an ultra -rare, chronically debilitating, and life threatening 
lysosomal storage disease, and one of the rarest of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Varying in severity and progression rate, MPS [ADDRESS_11240] decade of life due to compounding medical proble ms. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_11795] (ERT) in MPS 7 models and the success of ERT in four other 
MPS disorders (MPS 1, MPS 2, MPS 4A, and MPS 6), MPS [ADDRESS_11241] an 
approved treatment available.  Development in this disease has not proceeded because the extreme rarity (less than 100 patient s identified worldwide and an estimated incidence rate of 
less than 1 per 250,000 births) and clinical heterogeneity has made it impractical to approach with traditional clinical study designs and endpoints.   
UX003 is a formulation of recombinant human beta-glucuronidase (rhGUS), intended as an 
ERT for MPS 7. Ultragenyx has conducted 3 clinical studies to date in  support of UX003 
development. A retrospective study (UX003-CL001) reviewed medical records of patient s 
with MPS 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_11242] of ERT products (Aldurazyme
®, 
Elaprase®, and Naglazyme®) on total urinary GAG (uGAG) excretion and formally analyze 
the relationship of uGAG to the major clinical ma nifestations of MPS disorders. Prospective, 
interventional studies include an initial Phase 1/2 study (UX003-CL201) assessing saf ety, 
efficacy, and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of UX003; a Phase 2 study (UX003-CL203) i n patients 
under 5 years old, and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_11796] 3 study (UX003-CL301). 
5.1 Overview of MPS 7 
MPS 7 (Sly syndrome) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder 
originally described by [CONTACT_11844] 1973 (Sly et al. 1973). MPS [ADDRESS_11243] heter ogeneous of the MPS disorders. MPS 7 is characterized by a deficiency of 
the lysosomal enzyme GUS, which is required for the degradation of the GAGs: dermatan sulfate (DS), chondroitin-6 sulfate (CS),  and heparan sulfate (HS). This deficiency results in 
GAG accumulation in many tissues and organs, leading to numerous clinical symptoms similar to those observed for MPS 1 (Hurler Syndrome) and MPS 2 (Hunter Syndrome) 
(Neufeld et al. 2001). 
Protocol Number:  UX003-CL202 
Amendment 3:  28 JUL 2016  
 
 
Confidential Page 25 MPS 7 genotypes/phenotypes have been studied for man y years (reviewed in (Tomatsu et al.  
2009). A total of 49 unique mutations were identified in a total of 103 mutant alleles found in 
56 patient s, with 9% of the  alleles unidentified. Missense mutations account for 78.6% of 
total alleles; the remaining were nonsense mutations, deletions, or splice site mutations, all likely leading to a null genotype and severe phenotype. This is a much higher frequency of 
missense mutations than is normally found in other MPS diseases. For example, in MPS 1, 
nearly 70% of alleles are nonsense mutations with two dominant stop mutations accounting 
for a large fraction of all mutations (Scott et al. 1995). 
The clinical course and disease progression of MPS [ADDRESS_11244] severe form of the disease can uniquely present at birth with hydrops fetalis, a severe neonatal condition in which the child retains an enormous amount of fluid throughout 
the body ( Vervoort et al. 1996). Infants with hydrops fetalis rarely survive beyond a few 
weeks to a few months of age ( Neufeld et al. 2001 ).   
Patients with severe MPS 7, who are not born with non- immune hydrops fetalis  frequently 
present as infants or young children with clinical signs and symptoms including hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary infections, cardiac problems, corneal clouding, hearing loss, hernias, joint stiffness and short stature ( Neufeld et al.  2001). Diagnosis of MPS 7 is often 
made through clinical examination and urine tests for excess glycosoaminoglycans excreted 
in the urine ( Sewell et al. 1982 ). Due to the clinical heterogeneity of the disease,  it is 
recommended that GUS activity in all suspected cases of lysosomal storage disease be evaluated through enzymatic analysis of leukocytes or fibroblasts ( Lee et al. 1985 ).  
Many patients experience progressive pulmonary problems as a result of airway obstruction 
(enlarged adenoids and tonsils, secretions, infections and tracheal abnormalities) leading to sleep apnea and pulmonary insufficiency, eventually requiring tracheostomy. Significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_11797] f requent recurrent and chronic 
nasopharyngeal and respi[INVESTIGATOR_11798] (Kakkis et al. 1996b), ( Neufeld et al. 2001 ). Heart disease is also common in 
patients with severe MPS 7, although it may not develop or manifest  until later in life. 
Valvular insufficiency due to thickening and calcification of the valves, arterial lesions of the coronary arteries and obstruction of the thoracic aorta like that observed for Hurle r

treatments for MPS 7.  Multiple clinical trials have been conducted to establish safety and 
efficacy of ERT in MPS diseases (reviewed in (Valayannopoulos et al. 2011). The treatment 
regimen for ERT involves weekly (QW) or every other week (QOW) intravenous (IV) infusions of the recombinant human enzyme. Many patients treated with ERT experience 
infusion-associated reactions (IARs). Observed clinical benefits include improved walking 
ability, joint range of motion, improved lung function, decreased liver volume, and decreased (but not normalized) uGAG levels. Most MPS patients develop antibodies to the recombinant 
enzyme; in some severely affected MPS 1 patients, antibody titer was inversely related to the 
reduction in uGAG levels ( Clarke et al. 2009).   
Clinical study data in the Phase [ADDRESS_11249] 4- 6 weeks of ERT treatment, then reach a plateau

considering the additional time needed for inflammation and injury to heal and recover following the resolution of lysosomal storage, and is consistent with uGAG’s potential as a predictor of tissue response. In the clinical studies, changes in uGAG were able to 
differentiate between effective and less effective dose regimens, with reductions of >50% associated with substantial efficacy based on clinical measures ( Table 5.2.1). In all cases, 
uGAG reduction ≥ 50% was associated with  significant clinical benefit. For idursulfase, the 
QOW regimen showed less than 50% reduction and less efficacy; this difference was detected and predicted by [CONTACT_11845] (Muenzer et al. 2006). For this 
reason, a measure of uGAG should be predictive of changes in lysosomal storage conducive 
to clinical improvement in MPS patients.

5.3 Brief Overview of UX003 Development  
UX003 is intended as an IV ERT for the treatment of MPS 7. A brief overview of existing 
information on UX003 is provided below; a comprehensive review of available data is 
contained in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) provided by [CONTACT_11846]. 
(Ultragenyx), which should be reviewed prior to initiating the study.   
5.3.1 Brief Description of UX003 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient in UX003, rhGUS, is produced in a genetically 
engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line that expresses the normal full length human 
GUS protein. The rhGUS protein is synthesized as an 80 kDa monomer with 651 amino 
acids remaining after removal of the 22 amino acid signal peptide ( Oshima et al. 1987). 
After glycosylation at four N-linked glycosylation sites at asparagines 173, 272, [ADDRESS_11251] at the 
C-terminus after production, once delivered to the lysosome, proteolysis removes 18 amino acids from the C -terminal end to form a 78 kDa monomer ( Islam et al. 1993). Biologically, 
purified rhGUS exi sts as a ~[ADDRESS_11252] in this clinical trial, is a 
sterile liquid buffered saline formulation of rhGUS that contains enzyme at a concentration 
of 2 mg/mL in a 10 mL glass vial filled to allow the withdrawal of a 5.0 mL deliverable 
volume.

Confidential Page 28 [IP_ADDRESS] UX003 Mechanism of Action in MPS 7 
UX003 belongs to a class of ERTs that  includes approved products for MPS 1, MPS 2, MPS 
4A and MPS 6.  The active pharmaceutical ingredient in UX003, rhGUS, is a member of the 
lysosomal hydrolase family of enzymes that catalyze breakdown of complex carbohydrates.  Human GUS catalyzes the hydrolysis of β D- glucuronic acid residues from the non- reducing 
end of glycosaminoglycans: DS, CS, and HS ( Vervoort et al. 1996). In vitro and in vivo, 
rhGUS is taken up by [CONTACT_11847] d tissues by [CONTACT_11848] 6-phosphate 
receptor (CIM6PR) via the mannose 6 -phosphate recognition residues located on the 
enzyme’s N -linked oligosaccharides. Uptake by [CONTACT_11849]6PR occurs in a large number of 
tissues and is important for the maxima l effectiveness of the enzyme. The enzyme can also 
be taken up by [CONTACT_11850] (MR) due to some terminal mannose residues located on high mannose N -linked oligosaccharides. Clearance by [CONTACT_11851]: the spleen, Kupffer cells in the liver, and circulating 
macrophages in the plasma. Together, these recognition signals are responsible for the rapid clearance and tissue distribution of infused lysosomal enzymes such as rhGUS from the 
circulation. Both types of delivery can have therapeutic benefit as tissues with the MR also 
manifest substantial GAG storage in the MPS disorders, although the mannose 6-phosphate system is sufficient for uptake into all cell types.

The nonclinical toxicology progr am includes five studies , including an 8- week 
biodistribution study in tolerant MPS 7 mice, a GLP acute toxicity study in Sprague 
Dawley rats, a 26-week chronic toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys, and dose 
range-finding developmental toxicity studies in rabbits and Sprague Dawley  rats. At dose 
levels up to 20 mg/kg QOW,  no toxicologically -significant findings were related to the 
administration of UX003. These studies support a 5-fold safety factor relative to the 4  mg/kg 
dose planned in this clin ical study. The no observed adverse- effect level (NOAEL) for single 
IV dose administration in these studies was 20 mg/kg. A large number of studies in MPS [ADDRESS_11254] shown that recombinant GUS 
enzyme replacement is distributed to many tissues and significantly reduces or prevents 
lysosomal storage during treatment (O'Connor et al. 1998),( Sands et al. 1994), ( Sands et al. 
1997), (Sands et al. 2001 ), (Vogler et al. 1996), ( Vogler et al. 2005). Biodistribution of 
rhGUS has been seen in many tissues affected by [CONTACT_11852] 7 including the brain, liver, spleen, 
heart, kidney, bone and lung ( Vogler et al. 2005), ( Grubb et al. 2008 ), (Sly et al. 2006).

in bone development, growth, cognitive ability, hearing, immune function, and survival (Sands et al. 1997), ( Sands et al. 2001), ( Vogler et al. 1996). Additionally, treatment of  
MPS 7 mice with high doses of rhGUS resulted in widespread delivery of enzyme as well as 
delivery across the blood-brain barrier with corresponding reductions in lysosomal storage in nearly all tissues, including the brain. The increased enzyme levels and accompanying 
reduction in lysosomal storage correlated with both dose and duration of treatment ( Vogler et 
al. 2005). Histopathologic evaluation of tissues from MPS [ADDRESS_11255]. Joyce Fox and Steven and Alexandra

(SAEs) or IARs have been reported ( Fox et al. 2015). The patient elected to continue UX003 
treatment.  
A second em ergency IND was granted to treat a 4 -month old MPS 7 infant born with severe 
non-immune hydrops fetalis ([CONTACT_11892], [LOCATION_001] University School of Medicine). 
The patient has received infusions for approximately 1 year ; uGAG was reduced by [CONTACT_2669]  
70% after several infusions. No drug- related IAR s have occurred  in this Investigator -
sponsored trial (IST) . The patient was subsequently enrolled in the Phase 2 study 
(UX003-CL203) described below.   
The clinical development program for UX003 rhGUS ERT consis ts primarily of the

5.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Potential Benefits 
An initial Phase 1/2 study has shown that UX003 can reduce lysosomal storage and uGAG 
and is expected to provide clinical benefit. Data from nonclinical toxicology and safety pharmacology studies, along with published data from MPS 7  mouse model studies, provide 
guidance on potential benefits and risks of UX003 treatment. The nonclinical data support the safe use of UX003 when dosed up to 4 mg/kg as an IV infusion and suppor t a 5-fold 
safety factor relative to the 4 mg/kg dose. The risk for off -target effects is reduced by [CONTACT_11854]. The enzymatic activity of GUS has a pH optimum betwe en 
3.5 and 4.5 (data on file). At pH [ADDRESS_11256] been incorporated into the design of the current study to prevent, monitor and manage potential reactions. These measures include prophylactic premedication of patients with 
antihistamine, and staged and controlled infusion rates. The large fraction of MPS 7 patients 
with missense mutations may result in a reduced immune response to ERT since residual protein in the tolerant mouse ( Sly et al. 2001) and also in MPS 1 humans undergoing ERT is 
associated with reduced immune responses (Yogalingam et al. 2004).  
With no treatments currently available for this progressive, ultimately -fatal genetic ultra -rare 
disease, a clear medical need exists for a novel disease-modifying approach that holds the potential for altering the clinical course of disease progression. Overall , the safety and 
efficacy data from clinical and nonclinical studies in combination with an understanding of

5.5 Study Rationale 
Mucopolysaccharidosis type 7 (MPS 7, Sly syndrome) is an ultra- rare (< 100 cases currently 
identified worldwide), chronically debilitating and life threatening lysosomal storage disease.  
It is characterized by a deficiency of  the lysosomal enzyme GUS, required for degradation of 
the GAGs: DS, CS and HS. The GUS deficiency results in lysosomal accumulation of GAGs in multiple tissues and organs throughout the body and numerous clinical signs and symptoms as a result of tissue d amage and organ dysfunction. There are currently no 
approved treatments for MPS 7.

enrolled and treated with UX003 in other clinical studies or programs are  eligible for 
enrollment.  
The study will continue for up to 144 weeks or until one of the following occurs: the subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator or U ltragenyx, or the study is terminated.

Confidential Page 33 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a multi-center, multinational, open- label treatment  and extension study in subjects 
with MPS 7. The study will assess long -term safety and efficacy of UX003 treatment and 
will continue for approximately 144 weeks or until one of the following occurs: the subject 
withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, or the study is terminated.  
Subjects with MPS [ADDRESS_11258].  Subjects with MPS  7 
who were enrolled in either an Ultragenyx sponsored study (e.g., UX003-CL301) or non-Ultragenyx sponsored clinical studies (e.g., ISTs, expanded access/compassionate use) may be eligible for enrollment. Those subjects enrolling from a previous UX003 study 
should have a reasonable benefit- risk assessment from their primary study as determined by 
[CONTACT_11856], in order to continue with long- term therapy in this extension study. To be 
enrolled, subjects need to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
All subjects will receive 4 mg/kg UX003 QOW unless data from prior studies define a different dose either fo r that subject or the use of UX003 in general.  
As has been observed with other MPS ERTs, some subjects may experience infusion-associated reactions (IARs) wit h the administration of UX003. Thus, prophylactic 
antihistamine will be administered prio r to each study drug infusion. Antipyretic pretreatment 
may also be given at  the Investigator’s discretion. To minimize the potential for IARs, 
infusions will initially be administered on a slower rate schedule f ollowed by [CONTACT_11857]. Infusion rate may be slowed to manage or reduce IARs. 
Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on physical examinations, clinical laboratory analyses, and reporting of adverse events (AEs) and SAEs.    
Evaluations of efficacy, including uGAG levels, 6- minute walk test (6MWT), pulmonary 
function testing, shoulder flexion, visual acuity, and fine and gross motor function will be 
performed according to the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1 and Section  7.5) if age appropriate 
and subject is able to perform. Additional assessments will be performed, as indicated, to assess serum biomarkers, [ADDRESS_11259] (3MSCT), hepatosplenomegaly, growth 
velocity, cardiac size and function, ICR endpoint (if appropriate), pat ient-reported outcomes, 
and subject/parent/caregiver global impression of change. 
The termination visit should be completed by [CONTACT_11841] [ADDRESS_11260] dose of study drug.  Efficacy assessments performed within 30 days will not be repeated at the 
Protocol Number:  UX003-CL202 
Amendment 3:  [ADDRESS_11261] s with MPS 7 will further establish 
the long-term safety and efficacy profile of QOW infusions of UX003 (rhGUS) at a dose of 
4 mg/kg. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_11262] AE collection and laboratory evaluations, safety 
assessments will also include Adverse Physiology Related Group ( APRG) reporting, a novel 
method synthesizing safety symptoms into multi-domain physiology related groups.  APRG reporting provides the opportunity to detect variable adverse physiologies that might be expressed variably within an d between subjects in a study. For example, anaphylactoid 
reactions are common IARs in ERT programs , and have a set pattern of specific sym ptoms 
and timing of reactions. During treatment , soon after the acceleration of the infusion, 
fever/chills, tachycardia/lower blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_11802], and abdominal pain/nausea/spontaneous smooth muscle contraction may occur. This is one 
example of a set of symptoms associated w ith a complement- mediated IAR. Symptoms 
may occur to varying degrees or be reported differently depending on the observer. 
Pre-set associated symptoms for adverse p hysiologies like anaphylactoid/complement 
mediated IARs, will help drive the assessment of the IARs in a more precise way, and assure the IAR is rep orted accurately.  IAR findings w ill be recorded and tracked within the case 
report form (CRF) for likely APR Gs, to enhance the detection of the common pattern of 
IARs. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_11263] and clinical benefit in MPS disorders (Section 5.2). Considering the evidence on qualification of uGAG as a relevant biomarker for 
MPS disorders, the similarity of MPS 7 to other MPS disorders, and the critical nature of this 
disease, which is too rare to be easily studied in traditional study designs with clinical endpoints, uGAG is reasonable for use as an important endpoint in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_11803] 7.

treatment benefit better than each endpoint alone. 
A multi-domain responder index (MDRI)  has been incorporated into the study design to 
provide an assessment of UX003 efficacy across a broad spectrum of clinical characteristics 
commonly observed in MPS 7 subjects. The minimal important difference (MID) for each 
variable will be defined and each subject scored for response to each variable.

bag, this must be done slowly, with liquid to liquid contact [CONTACT_11859]; the bags should be rocked gently for mixing. Shaking of vials or infusion bags or “volutrols” devices in which aggressive mixing and bubbles can occur are not acceptable. 
Study drug will be administered  by [CONTACT_11835] 4 hours.  Infusions 
will be administered on a rate -schedule involving a slower infusion rate initially followed by 
[CONTACT_11860] o r reduce IARs. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional details on the infusion 
rate schedule. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_11806] (EMLA) cream or equivalent may be applied to the IV site prior to the infusion to ease the pain of placing an IV line.  
At the discretion of the Investigator, an in- dwelling IV catheter (such as a Port -a-Cath

7.4.3 Selection of Doses in the Study  
The planned UX003 dose of 4 mg/kg is based on doses examined in an ongoing Phase 2 
clinical study in MPS 7 subjects , and further supported by [CONTACT_11861] 7 
mouse model and relevant species. The nonclinical data support chronic QOW administration  of UX003 at dose levels up to 4 mg/kg, with a relative 5- fold safety factor.  
The pharmacologic studies in the MPS 7 mouse showed that both 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg were effective doses with only a few tissues or cell types such as osteocytes responding better at 4 mg/kg versus 2 mg/kg. Safety was the same at all doses.  
The Phase 1/2 study (UX003-CL201) in MPS 7 subjects  evaluated UX003 administered at 
doses of 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg QOW. Preliminary results suggest the percent reduction in urinary GAG excretion is greatest with the 4 mg/kg dose with mean reductions of approximately 60% observed, while the reductions at 2 mg/kg were in the 40- 50% range. Additionally, 
during the forced dose titration process, the reductions in uGAG observed at 4 mg/kg lessened when subject s returned to the 2 mg/kg dose, suggesting a decrease in efficacy.  
These changes in uGAG exceeded an absolute difference of 10% and were of sufficient magnitude to consider the 4 mg/ kg dose a more appropriate dose. In the clinical studies of 
ERT for other MPS disorders, changes in uGAG were able to differentiate between effective and less effective dose regimens, with reductions of >50% associated with substantial efficacy based on cl inical measures.  Infusions at 4 mg/kg in [ADDRESS_11277] been no drug- related IARs at any 
dose to date. Therefore, the 4 mg/kg dose appears to be well tolerated at this time.  
The therapeutic ERT doses in prior successful programs for other MPS disorders (0.58, 0.5 
and 1 mg/kg weekly for MPS 1, 2, 4A, and 6, respectively) were based on comparable 
doses that exhibited efficacy in their respective animal models.  PK data in MPS 1, MPS 2, 
MPS 4A, and MPS 6 subjects demonstrate that doses of 0.2 to 2 mg/kg are adequate to 
achieve enzyme concentrations of ~10 -27 nM in the circulation. These enzyme levels are 
approximately 10- to 30-fold the uptake constants (1-2.7 nM) for the mannose 6 phosphate receptor and are believed to saturate delivery of enzyme to the tissues  (Kakkis et al. 1994), 
(Kakkis et al. 1996a ), (Kakkis et al. 2001), ( Dvorak-Ewell et al. 2010).  Similar uptake 
constants (1.2-2.6 nM) were obtained in studies with human MPS [ADDRESS_11278] cells in vitro 
(Ultragenyx data).  Studies with rhGUS in MPS 7 mice at doses of 4 mg/kg show that serum 
GUS concentrations of >10 -fold the uptake constant were readily achieved and demonstrated 
that enzyme was delivered to a variety of important tissues, implying that the efficacious dose should be within this range ( Grubb et al. 2008). 
A higher dose is needed to provide the same rhGUS molar concentration as other MPS enzymes, since rhGUS enzyme has two active sites per tetramer and the molecular weight (332 kDa tetramer) is approximatel y 4-fold higher compared to the other MPS 
enzymes. The equivalent number of moles of enzyme active sites would require about two 
Protocol Number:  UX003-CL202 
Amendment 3:  28 JUL 2016  
 
 
Confidential Page 41 times the efficacious dose for other MPS enzymes  on a mass or milligram basis. 
Therefore,  approximately 1 -4 mg/kg UX003 is esti mated to achieve the same molar 
concentration of active enzyme.  
The QOW dosing regimen is supported by [CONTACT_11862]- life and increased 
stability of rhGUS co mpared with other MPS enzymes. Data from the earliest MPS ERT 
studies showed that when hum an enzymes for MPS 1  or 2 were applied to deficient 
human fibroblasts, the half-life of the enzyme in the lysosome was on the order of 2-5 days 
(Kakkis et al. 1994), ( Elaprase 2006) leading to weekly dosing frequency as the optimal 
choice.  For rhGUS, this experiment showed a half-life of about 40 days, which is a substantial increase over MPS 1  or MPS 2 enzymes, which are dosed weekly. The rhGUS 
enzyme is also a more stable enzyme than the other MPS enzymes at neutral pH, as it might be exposed to the circulation before uptake by [CONTACT_11863].  Both the increased half- life and 
stability of rhGUS indicate QOW dosing should be adequate in humans. 
All subjects may  receive up  to 144 weeks of UX003 treatment . The treat ment duration is 
sufficient to assess long -term safety and provide sufficient insight on sustained clinical 
effects and improvements in pediatric, adolescent, and adult efficacy of UX003 treatment in 
MPS 7 subjects.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Testing  
Female subjects of childbearing potential will have urine pregnancy tests at the  Baseline visit 
and every 12 weeks throughout the study (and at the T ermination  visit). Female subjects with 
a positive pregnancy test at Baseline will not be enrolled in the study. Females who have not 
experienced menarche will not undergo pregnancy testing. Should a female subject 
experience menarche during the course of the study, the subject will be considered a female subject of childbearing potential and undergo urine pregnancy testing per the Schedule of Events (Table 2.1).  
Additional pregnancy tests will be performed at any visit in which pregnancy status is in question. A serum pregnancy test will be performed in the event of a positive or equivocal urine pregnancy test result, or can be performed if pregnancy test by [CONTACT_11864]. Pregnancy in subject or partner must be reported ( Section [IP_ADDRESS].1); pregnant subjects will 
be withdrawn  from study drug. At the conclusion of the pregnancy, a decision will be made if 
the female subject may  resume study drug based on study treatment risk- benefit evaluation 
and willingness of the s ubject to comply with the contraceptive requirements. In the event of 
a pregnancy in the partner of a male subject, the male subject may continue with study drug .

[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be reviewed and recorded in the subject’s CRF at each 
study visit, beginning at the Baseline visit.   
For subjects enrolling from an Ultragenyx-sponsored clinical trial , medications 
(investigational, prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) and nutritional supplements reported as ongoing at primary study’s End of Treatment visit and any new medications taken prior to Base line will be reviewed and recorded  at Baseline visit. Any enrolling subject 
who had an early termination in the primary study will have their baseline concomitant medications collected in the same manner as a subject who is treatment naïve or enrolling 
from a non-Ultragenyx sponsored study (see following paragraph). 
For subjects who are treatment naïve or who are enrolling from a non-Ultragenyx sponsored clinical trial, medications (investigational, prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) and nutritional supplements taken during the 30 days prior to Baseline will be reviewed and recorded. 
At each subsequent visit, change in medications since the previous visit will be recorded.  A discussion of prior and concomitant medications is provided in Section  7.4.4.

any new AEs prior to Baseline will be reviewed and recorded at Baseline visit.  Any enrolling 
subject who had an early termination in the primary study will have their baseline AE information collected in the same manner as a subject  who is treatment naïve or  enrolling 
from a non-Ultragenyx sponsored study (see following paragraph). 
For subjects wh o are treatment naïve or who are enrolling from a non-Ultragenyx sponsored

Clinically significant changes from study baseline in physical examination findings, vital 
signs, and clinical laboratory parameters, will be recorded as AEs or SAEs, if appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Physiology Related Group Reporting 
APRG is an approach to safety reporting f or common expected AEs that have a set of 
symptoms all related to an adverse physiologic pathway. P atterns of IARs will be specifically 
evaluated throughout the study. IARs will be characterized into [ADDRESS_11292] types based on 
timing of onset relative to th e infusion and specific clinical manifestations:  anaphylactoid, 
anaphylaxis, urticarial (with or without a ngioedema), and immune complex. Safety reporting 
of individual AEs will be recorded in parallel.  
Refer to the Study Reference Manual for additional details on APRG reporting.  
7.5.3 Urinary GAG Excretion  (Secondary Objective)  
Results of prior non- clinical and clinical work demonstrate a direct relationship between 
disease severity and clinical outcomes with uGAG levels. The studies also demonstrate the 
sensitivity of uGAG to differences in clinical effect within the therapeutic range of doses and 
verified the sustained long- term effects of the ERT. These data show that uGAG reductions 
above a threshold of >50% are associated with clinically meaningful changes in clinical parameters in all three MPS ERT programs.  
First morning void urine will be evaluated for uGAG at Baseline then every 12 weeks 
throughout the study (or termination visit) . A uGAG assessment  performed at the primary 
(or feeder) study End of Tre atment visit or within [ADDRESS_11293] morning voids to assure the urine is adequately concentrated. Refer to the Laboratory Manual for details on sample 
collection an d processing requirements. Supplementary assays for uGAG may be performed. 
Urinary GAG excretion will provide a biochemical measure of t he biological action of 
UX003. These assessments will be supported by [CONTACT_11865], including a multi-domain res ponder index to provide an assessment of UX003 efficacy in MPS 7 
subjects. 
7.5.4 Other Efficacy Measures  
Other efficacy assessments , including a multi-domain clinical responder index, will be used 
to assess clinical changes following UX003 treatment.  In gene ral, other efficacy assessments 
will be performed only if they were performed in the primary (or feeder) study. 
Efficacy assessments not  performed during the primary ( or feeder study ) will not be required

assessments as indicated in Table 2.1.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Multi-domain Responder Index  
Single clinical endpoints may n ot adequately  cover the breadth of disease. Novel approaches 
to combine independent multi- domain analyses assure that the broader basis for efficacy can 
be assessed. The MDRI  consisting of 6MWT, FVC, shoulder flexion, visual acuity, and 
BOT-2 (fine motor and gross motor), provides an assessment of UX003 efficacy across a 
broad spectrum of clinical characteristics commonly observed in MPS [ADDRESS_11294] scored for each variable.  
For subjects enrolling f rom prior clinical studie s with UX003, the MDRI will only be 
evaluated if the clinical outcomes described above were previously assessed in their primary 
(or feeder) study.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Serum Biomarkers of Inflammation  
Blood samples will be collected at the Baseline, Week 24, and Week 48 visits for assessment 
of biomarkers of inflammation in serum using established quantitative methods, if indicated based on prior work. If the termination visit occurs after Week  48, blood for serum 
biomarkers of inflammation will not be collected.  An inflammation biomarker assessment  
performed at the primary (or feeder) study End of Treatment visit or within 30 days prior to 
Baseline may be used for the study baseline. The inflammatory biomarkers may include, but not be limited to, the  following:  tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF -alpha) and macrophage 
inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP -1alpha). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Six Minute Walk Test  
Subjects who cannot walk may omit the 6MWT. Some subjects may be too young and/or physically impaired to reliably perform th e test, the test performance at the Baseline visit will 
be used to determine feasibility  for naïve subjects. The 6MWT may not be performed at 
subsequent study visits if the subject is unable to reliably or safely perform the test at Baseline. Subjects enrolling from an Ultragenyx sponsored study (e.g., UX003-CL301) will 
continue to perform the 6MWT if evaluated during the primary/ feeder study. The 6MWT 
will be administered to appropriate subjects once per test day to appropriate subjects during 
the Baseline visit, then every 24 weeks thereafter (or at t ermination  visit). A 6MWT 
performed at the primary (or feeder) study End of Treatment visit or within 30 days prior to 
Baseline may be used for the study baseline assessment .    
For subjects enrolling from pri or clinical studies  with UX003, the 6MWT will only be

The Bruininks- Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency – 2nd Edition (BOT-2) is a standardized, 
norm-referenced test of fine and gross motor skills for children (≥ 4 years of age) and young adults (Bruininks et al. 2005). Four subtests of the BOT- 2 will be administe red to evaluate 
treatment -related changes in fine motor proficiency and gross motor function: fine motor 
precision, manual dexterity, balance, running speed and agility. The  test may be modified 
and tests omitted to accommodate the needs of the subject.  The BOT-2 will be assessed at the 
Baseline, Week  24, and Week 48 visits. If the termination visit occurs after Week  48, BOT -2 
assessments will not be conducted. A BOT -2 assessment  performed at the primary (or feeder) 
study End of Treatment visit or  within 30 days prior to Baseline may be used for the study 
baseline assessment .  
For subjects enrolling from previous clinical studies with UX003, the BOT -2 will only be 
administered  if previously performed in their primary (or feeder) study. A BOT-2 performed  
within 30 days prior to Baseline may be used for the study b aseline assessment . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Three Minute Stair Climb Test  
The 3MSCT (Zech et al. 2011) will be used to assess funct ional power via stair climbing  
capacity.  Subjects who cannot cl imb stairs may omit this test. Some subjects may be too 
young and/or physically impaired to reliably perform the test, the test performance at the 
Baseline visit will be used  to determine feas ibility for naïve subjects. The 3MSCT may 
not be performed at subsequent study visits if the subject is unable to reliably or safely perform the test at Baseline. Subjects enrolling from an Ultragenyx sponsored study 
(e.g., UX003-CL301) will continue to perform the 3MSCT if evaluated during the 
primary/feeder study.  The 3MSCT will be administered to appropriate subjects during the

Confidential Page 53 [IP_ADDRESS] Goniometry  
The maximum passive shoulder range of motion in both flexion and extension will be 
measured in degrees using a goniometer. Shoulder flexion wil l be the evaluable measure.  
The highest value of three shoulder flexion and extension range of motion measurements for each side will be reported and compared to known normal standards for age. Goniometry will be performed during the Baseline visit, then every 24 weeks thereafter (or at termination  
visit). A shoulder flexion, or goniometry, assessment performed at the primary (or  feeder) 
study End of Treatment visit or  within 30 days prior to Baseline may be used for the study 
baseline. 
For subjects enrolling from previous clinical studies with UX003, goniometry will only be 
administered  if they were previously performed in their primary (or feeder) study.  
Goniometry performed  within 30 days prior to Baseline may be used for the study baseline 
assessment . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anthropometrics  
Growth will be assessed from anthropometric measurements (standing height [or recumbent 
length, if applicable] and weight) at 12-week intervals beginning at t he Baseline visit to 
Week 24, then every 24 weeks thereafter (or at t ermination  visit). Every effort should be 
made to collect standing height when appropriate. If unable to collect standing height, sitting height should be collected for that subject. Growth velocity will be calculated and compared with pre-treatment growth velocity whe n available.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Visual Acuity  
Visual acuity will be meas ured (corrected and uncorrected) using a standard eye chart and 
recorded for each eye independently. For this study, visual acuity will be assessed at the 
Baseline visit, then every 24 weeks  thereafter  (or at termination  visit). A visual acuity 
assessment  performed at the primary (or feeder) study End of Treatment visit or within 
30 days pri or to Baseline may be used for the study baseline. 
For subjects enrolling from previous clinical studies with UX003, visual acuity assessments  
will only be administered  if they were previously performed in their primary (or fe eder) 
study. A visual acuity assessment performed  within 30 days prior to Baseline may be used 
for the study baseline assessment .

Confidential Page 54 [IP_ADDRESS] Individual Clinical Response  
The ICR may provide a specific assessment of the ability of UX003 to impact the most 
important clinical manifestation of MPS [ADDRESS_11299]. 
For subjects who were previously treated in the Ultragenyx-sponsored MPS 7 Phase 3 
clinical study UX003-CL301 and had an ICR assigned, that same ICR may be followed in 
this long-term treatment and  extension study. If applicable, the ICR will be identified during 
the Baseline visit and  then assessed every 24 weeks thereafter (or at t ermination  visit).  
During the previous Ultragenyx sponsored MPS [ADDRESS_11300] or parent/caregiver about signs and symptoms 
of MPS [ADDRESS_11301]’s daily life  (Clinical Problem Evaluation). 
Answers will have been  mapped to an appropriate clinical outcome measure. For example, 
difficulty walking could map to the 6MWT; breathing problems to FVC; trouble manipulating small objects to BOT -2 fine motor function; difficulty with balance or agility to 
BOT-2 gross motor function; reduced joint mobility to shoulder flexion maximum range of 
motion; and tiredness /fatigue to the PedsQL -multidimensional fatigue sc ale.  
The determination of the ICR in Ultragenyx study UX003-CL301 will have been based on, 
but not limited to: 1) the specific concerns that the subject/parent/caregiver has reported; 2) the ability of the subject to reliably complete the assessment; and 3) the extent of impairment measured in the outcome of interest and will take into consideration 
developmental, cognitive, and behavioral factors observed at both the Screening and 
Randomization (Week 0) visits. The clinical outcome ranked with the highest impact on daily life that can be reliably completed by [CONTACT_11866] a thr eshold level of impairment 
will be selected as the ICR for that subject. The Investigator will be responsible for defining 
the ICR for each subject in consultation with an independent clinical consultant during previous study, UX003-CL301.   
For subjects that have not participated in the UX003-CL301 study, the ICR endpoint will not 
be defined  in this study . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Scoring of Impactful Clinical Problems 
The three most impactful clinical problems as reported by [CONTACT_11867]/caregiver during the Clinical Pro blem Evaluation may  be identified and scored on a Likert scale.  
The Likert scale will be administered during the Baseline visit, then every 24 weeks 
thereafter (or at termination  visit).     
For UX003 treatment- naïve subjects , the initial Clinical Problem Evaluation will occur at the 
Baseline visit.  For subjects previously enrolled in the Ultragenyx-sponsored MPS 7 Phase 3 
clinical study UX003-CL301, the Clinical Problems identified during the UX003-CL301 Randomization visit will continued to be scored th roughout this study. For these subjects the

Refer to the Study Reference Manual for more details of the scoring . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject-Reported Disability , Quality of Life, and Fatigue 
For UX003 treatment-naïve subjects and subjects enrolling from the MPS 7 Phase 3 
Ultragenyx sponsored study (i.e., UX003-CL301) , subject-reported disability  and pain will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_11868] (MPS HAQ), and either 
Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) or Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (as appropriate for subject age ). These subject -reported outcome measures will be 
administered to evaluate treatment -related changes in self -care and mobility activities of 
daily living including feeding, dressing, bathing, grooming, tooth brushing, toi leting, 
mobility, walking and stair climbing.   
For subjects enrolling from previous clinical studies with UX003, t hese subject -reported 
outcome measures will only be administered  if they were previously performed in their 
primary (or feeder) study.  Subject-reported outcome measures performed  within 30 days 
prior to Baseline may be used for the study baseline assessment .   
Age-appropriate questionnaires will be completed at the  Baseline visit, then every 24 weeks 
thereafter (or at termination  visit). For subjects enrolling from the MPS 7 Phase 3 
Ultragenyx sponsored study (i.e., UX003-CL301) , subject-reported outcome assessment s 
performed at the primary (or feeder) study End of Treatmen t visit or within 30 days prior to 
Baseline may be used for the study baseline.    
The MPS HAQ will be administered to all age groups. Subjects will consistently complete the same questionnaire (HAQ or CHAQ) administered at baseline for the duration 
of the study regardless of whether their age changes f rom 13 to 14 during the study. 
The age-appropriate version of the PedsQL multidimensional fatigue module will be 
administered throughout the study.   
MPS Health Assessment Questionnaire:  The MPS HAQ was deve loped to assess the 
self-care and mobility skills of subjects with MPS 1.  As MPS 7 shares many similar 
features with MPS 1, use of the MPS HAQ in this study should provide important 
information on the functional independence of MPS 7 subjects. The questionnaire includes 
self-care (eating/drinking, dressing, bathing, grooming, tooth brushing, and toileting) and 
mobility domains (dexterity, mobility, walking, stair climbing, and gross motor skills).  Caregiver assistance items are also included to assess the extent to which assistance is required for the performance of activities related to the self -care and mobility domains.  
Protocol Number:  UX003-CL202 
Amendment 3:  [ADDRESS_11302] 
to provide this information, it may be completed by a parent or caregiver. The same person should complete the questionnaire throughout the course of the study.   
Childhood Health Assessment Questionnai re:  The CHAQ was initially developed to 
assess health status in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (Singh et al. 1994).  
The instrument consists of 30 i tems in the Disability Index comprising 8 subscales:  dressing, 
grooming, arising, eating, walking, reach, grip, and activities; pain is indicated on a sliding scale. Higher scor es reflect greater disability. The CHAQ should be administered  for 
pediatric subjects only (˂14 years old). The subject’s parent or caregiver should complete the 
CHAQ, and the same person should complete the questionnaire throughout the course of the 
study. 
Health Assessment Questionnaire :  The full HAQ is among the first PRO instruments 
initially designed to represent a model of subject-oriented outcome assessment (Bruce et al.  
2005). The HAQ disability and pain scales (Fries et al. 1982) have been extensively validated 
and employed in a variety of diseases and conditions. There are 20 items in 8  categories that 
represent a comprehensive set of functio nal activities – dressing, rising, eating, walking, 
hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. The HAQ should be administered for subjects 
≥[ADDRESS_11303] to provide this information, it may be completed by a parent or caregiver. The same person should complete the questionnaire throughout the course of the study. 
Fatigue: Subject-reported fatigue will be assessed by [CONTACT_11869]™ (PedsQL)-M ultidimensional Fatigue Scale. The PedsQL multidimensional 
fatigue scale is a specific module of the PedsQL™ designed to measure fatigue in subjects aged 2 and above (
Varni et al. 1999), ( Varni et al. 2001). The  18-item scale is comprised of 
three subscales: general fatigue (6 items), sleep/rest fatigue (6 items) and cognitive fatigue (6 items).  The  age-appropriate version of the PedsQL will be completed by [CONTACT_11870].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Global Impression  
The CGI p rovides an overall measure that takes into account the subject 's history, 
psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the subject's ability to function. 
Subjects or parents/caregivers will provide a global assessment of change using a seven point scale ranging from -3 (severe worsening) to  +3 (significant improvement). This  global 
assessment will be accompanied by [CONTACT_11871]/caregivers on their perception of how treatment has impacted the subjects’ ability to perform activities of daily 
living.   
Protocol Number:  UX003-CL202 
Amendment 3:  [ADDRESS_11304]/Parent/Caregiver  CGI will be 
evaluated at the Baseline visit, then every 24 weeks thereafter (or at t ermination  visit).    
For subjects enrolling from the MPS 7 Phase 3 Ultragenyx sponsored study UX003-CL301, 
CGIs performed at the primary (or feeder) study End of Treatment visit or within [ADDRESS_11305]/Parent/Caregiver CGI will only be administered if previously performed in their primary (or feeder) study.  CGIs performed  within 30 days prior to Baseline may be used for 
the study baseline assessment .   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatosplenomegaly 
Liver and spleen size will be assessed qualitatively by [CONTACT_11872] 48-week 
intervals (or at Termination Visit).  
Refer to the Study Reference Manual for more detail.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiac Ventricular Mass  
Ventricular mass will be assessed by [CONTACT_11839] a z -score relati ve to normal 
ventricular mass. Evaluation of valvular function and cardiac function will be made primarily 
for safety purpos es. ECHO will be pe rformed at the Baseline visit, then every 48 weeks

visual acuity, and anthropometrics are routine, non- invasive procedures inflicting minimal 
pain/distress for the subject, while providing relevant indicators of cl inical disease phenotype 
and progression.  
The 6MWT, BOT-2, and 3MSCT are useful for assessing the compounded impact of 
multisystem clinical manifestations on the performance of activities of daily living. In 
MPS 7, performance on these tests is likely to be affected by [CONTACT_11873], cardiovascular, 
and musculoskeletal morbidity present in these subjects (McDonald et al. 2010). 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_11814], an important component of 
disease progression and mortality in MPS [ADDRESS_11309]-reported outcomes were included to assess functional disability and activities of daily 
living (e.g., MPS HAQ, CHAQ/HAQ, PedsQL , and CGI ). Other efficacy assessments , 
including a multi- domain clinical responder index enable a composite analysis of clinical 
changes. 
The ICR is a measure of each subject’s response to treatment that is selected based on the relevance of the outcome measure to concerns that the subject/parent/caregiver has reported, the subject’s ability to complete clinical outcome assessment reliably, and the extent of impairment for that individual.  The ICR enables evaluation of the clinical benefit of 
UX003 by [CONTACT_11874] a pre- specified individualized clinical outcome that is deemed 
most relevant for each subject and then determining an overall response rate for the study population. For subjects who were previously treated in an Ultragenyx sponsored study (i.e., UX003-CL301) and had an ICR assigned, that same ICR may be followed in this

to cooperate fully with the monitor and will work in good faith with the monitor to resolve any and all questions raised and any and all issues identified  by [CONTACT_2037]. 
The Investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the IRB/EC, and/or Ultragenyx or its 
designees have the right to access all CRFs, source documents, and other study documentation for on- site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the 
study to at least [ADDRESS_11323] be notified should the Investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full [ADDRESS_11324] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibilit y that the 
drug cause d the AE. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
Protocol Number:  UX003-CL202 
Amendment 3:  [ADDRESS_11325] caused death. 
An SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at 
any dose, in the view of either the Investigator or Ultragenyx, results in any of the following outcomes :  
• Death 
• A life-threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disru ption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11818] (e.g. for elective surgeries) are not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819]- existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, t hey may jeopardize the subject  or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.   
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
Wherever possible, the severity of all AEs will be graded using the NCI CTCAE 
(version 4.0) .  The majority of AEs can be graded using this system. 
If an AE cannot be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death using the following definitions.  
• Mild (Grade 1): Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of a minor 
irritant type, causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require 
therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. 
• Moderate (Grade 2): Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_11884]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning. 
• Severe (Grade 3): Events interrupt the pa rticipant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.

Confidential Page 66 • Life-threatening (Grade 4): Events that place the participant at immediate risk of death or 
are disabling.  
• Death (Grade 5):  Events that result in death. 
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
"serious" and "severe," which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is provided. The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significa nce (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"serious" which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
8.5.3 Relationship of Adverse Event s to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the 
following descriptions. 
Categories of attributions for “Unr elated” events:  
• Unrelated:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt. 
• Unlikely Related:  This category applied to an AE that is doubtfully related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
Categories of attributions for “Related” events: 
• Possibly Related:  This cate gory applies to an AE that may be related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
• Probably Related:  This category applies to an AE that is likely related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure.  
• Definitely Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
For the purposes of reporting to regulatory agencies, AEs deemed as Definitely, Probably or 
Possibly Related will be considered Related and those deemed Unrelated  or Unlikely Related 
will be considered Unrelated .

Confidential Page 67 8.5.4 Adverse Event Reporting to Ultragenyx  
[IP_ADDRESS] General 
All AEs (i.e. any new or worsening in severity or frequency of a pre-existing condition) with 
an onset after the subject signs consent for study participation must be promptly documented on the AE eC RF via the EDC system. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11820], obtaining supporting documents, and ensuring documentation of the event is adequate. Details of the AE must include severity, relationship to study drug, duration, and outcome.  
For subjects enrolling from an Ultragenyx-sponsored clinical trial , all AEs will be recorded 
from the time the subject signs the informed consent for this extension study and completion 
of the End of treatment visit in the primary study until [ADDRESS_11326] dose of study 
drug. Adverse events reported as ongoing at primary study’s End of treatment visit and any new AEs prior to Baseline will be reviewed and recorded at Baseline visit.  Any enrolling 
subject who had an early termination in t he primary study will have their baseline AE 
information collected in the same manner as a subject  who is treatment naïve or  enrolling 
from a non-Ultragenyx sponsored study (see following paragraph). 
For subjects who are treatment naïve or who are enrolling from a non-Ultragenyx sponsored 
clinical trial, a ll AEs will be recorded from the time the su bject signs the informed consent 
until [ADDRESS_11327]'s treatment assignment or dosage. All initial SAE reports 
must be followed by [CONTACT_3896]. These should include copi[INVESTIGATOR_11821]. SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_11885].  
Protocol Number:  UX003-CL202 
Amendment 3:  [ADDRESS_11328] notify the IRB/EC of the occurrence of the SAE, in writing, as 
soon as is practicable and in accordance with local law.  A copy of this notification must be 
provided to Ultragenyx or its designee. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Reports  
Reported pregnancy of a subject or a subje ct’s partner, while participating in this study, will 
be monitored for the full duration and/or followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known. Pregnancy associated SAEs will be processed and submitted, as required, as per the SAE reporting process. 
8.5.6 Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee will submit suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) to appropriate Regulatory Authorities (including Competent Authorities in all Member States concerned), IRBs/ECs, and Investigators as per local laws and regulations. 
Fatal and life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted no later than 7- calendar days of first 
knowledge of the event and follow-up information submitted within an additional eight (8) days, or as otherwise required per local laws and regulations . All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be 
submitted within [ADDRESS_11329] knowledge of the event.  
Principal Investigators are required to report any urgent safety matters to Ultragenyx or its 
designee within 24 hours. Ultragenyx or its designee will inform Regulatory Authorities, IRBs/ECs, and Investigators of any events (e.g. change to the safety profile of UX003, major 
safety findings) that may occur during the clinical trial that do not fall within the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R but may a ffect the safety of subjects participating in the clinical trials, as required, 
in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The reporting period for urgent safety issues is the period from signing the ICF through [ADDRESS_11330] dose of study drug.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11822]/ECs of SAEs and urgent safety matters, in 
accordance with IRB/EC requirements and local laws and regulations. A copy of this notification must be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee.  
Non-S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be maintained in the Ultragenyx safety database and provided in annual 
and/or periodic reports as per local laws and regulations. Ultragenyx or its designee will

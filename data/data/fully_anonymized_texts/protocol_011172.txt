Rationale for Development of CAP256V2
LS
 
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has 
remained a major global public health problem since the discovery of the virus in 1983. A 2018 
report by [CONTACT_100389]/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimat
es that 74.[ADDRESS_110503] been infected with HIV since the start of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], contributing to 32 
million deaths from AIDS
-
related illnesses
[
1
]. 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_100368], global incidences of new 
infections have actually declined from peak rates in t
he mid
-1990’s; a reduction attributed in part 
to increased availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the effective execution of 
prevention/treatment programs such as those that target mother
-
to
-
child transmission.
 
Unfortunately, HIV infection is extremely complex and none of the current therapeutic or 
prophylactic regimens can completely prevent or cure an infection or induce a full recovery of 
the host immune system.  Thus, novel prevention and cure strategies are being investigated 
Advances in B
-
cell immunology utilizing single cell cloning methods, next
-generation 
sequencing, high throughput computational analysis techniques, and increased cell culture 
survivability procedures, have resulted in the isolation of an extensive group of broadly-
neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) to the HIV-1 envelope (env) structure. 
These include antibodies with specificity to the gp41 membrane proximal external region 
(MPER) (10E8
,[
2
, 
3
]
),
 the CD4 binding site (VRC07-523LS
[
4
],
 
VRC01
[
5
],
 
N6
[
6
],
 
3BNC117
[
7
]
);
 the high-mannose patch (10-1074[
8
], 
PGT121
[
9
]
);
 and the V2 apex, also 
called 
V1V2 apex (PG9[
10
, 
11
], PGDM1400 [
9
], CAP256.25[
12
]
).
 
The VRC/NIAID is investigating 
clinical applications of these bNAbs
[
4
, 
6
, 
13
, 
14
]. 
The Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) team in 
collaboration with the VRC isolated a family of [ADDRESS_110504] HIV
-1 serum ne
utralizing 
activity from a participant enrolled in the CAPRISA 002 acute HIV infection study
[
12
, 
15
]. 
While these antibodies demonstrated robust neutralization potential against diverse HIV subtypes 
across the world
, CAP256-VRC26.25 was found to be extremely potent and capable of 
neutralizing 71% of HIV
-1 subtype C viruses, the dominant subtype in South Africa.  
CAP256
-
VRC26.25 was isolated at the VRC 
[
12
] and subsequently modified to incorporate the LS 
mutation resulting in increased recirculation of functional IgG and higher plasma half-
life
[
16
, 
17
].  In addition, a single amino acid change, lysine to alanine, was made in the CDRH3 region 
to improve manufacturability without altering neutralization breadth or potency. 
 
The variant 
with these changes was named CAP256V2LS.  The high potency, breadth in Clade C and long 
half-
life of the CAP256V2LS mAb make it an excellent candidate for further development for 
HIV prevention alone and/or in combination with other mAbs
[
18-22
].  
This 
 Phase I study will 
investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CAP256V2LS in healthy adults.

ationale for Study Design
 
The proposed 5mg/kg dose of CAP256V2LS administered via IV or SC route has been 
previously assessed in other Phase 1 trials in healthy adults for other VRC manufactured human 
bNAbs such as VRC01, VRC01LS, VRC07

[
17
,

 Administration by [CONTACT_100390] 5
 
mg/kg dose of these mAbs overall have been assessed as generally well tolerated,
 
with no deaths or serious adverse events that were ultimately determined to be related to the 
study product by [CONTACT_1034].  
R-
Gene
®
 10 (Arginine Hydrochloride Injection, USP
) will be added as a stabilizing agent to IV 
doses of CAP256V2LS.  R-Gene 10 was developed by [CONTACT_100391][INVESTIGATOR_100369] (HGH) in patients where the 
measurement of pi[INVESTIGATOR_100370]. 
 Arginine has been

commenced
 
in the 
South African trial CAPRISA 012B under the South African Health Products Regulatory 
Authority (SAHPRA).
 As of [ADDRESS_110506] administration during a one hour observation period.   
There were 76 unsolicited adverse events reported in 37 
out of 
42 (88
%) participants, of 
which 
[ADDRESS_110507]. Transient lympho
cy
topenia was a common 
event observed in 8 participants, of which 2 were mild (Grade 1 range, 600 to <650 cells/mm
3
) 
, 
2 were moderate 
(Grade 2 range, 500 to <600 cells/mm
3
)
, 2 events were severe 
(Grade 3 range, 
350 to <500 cells/mm
3
),
 and 2 were graded potentially life threatening (Grade 4 range, <350 
cells/mm
3
). These events occurred at day [ADDRESS_110508] discontinuation in any participant. No 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
have been 
reported to SAHPRA. Refer 
to the CAP256V2LS Investigator’s Brochure for additional information.  
 
Enrollment in this study, VRC 611, 
has
 been completed as of June 13th, 2022, with [ADDRESS_110509] as per protocol.

Local Reactogenicity
 
 
Of the ten participants enrolled in this study, four (40%) reported a local solicited adverse event.
 
All four of these participants were in the SC group. Two (20%) 
subjects reported mild severity
 
and two (20%) reported moderate severity symptoms. The most common local symptom was
 
redness at the injection site, with one (10%) participant reporting mild and two (20%) reporting 
moderate severity. One (10%) participant r
eported moderate swelling. One AE of mild pruritis
 
and one AE of mild pain at the injection site were also reported.
 
 
Systemic Reactogenicity
 
 
Of the 10 participants, 9 (90%) reported at least one or more systemic solicited AE with the
 
maximum severity bei
ng severe for 1 (10%) participant, moderate for 7 (70%) participants, and
 
mild for 1 (10%) participant. The most common adverse events were malaise and muscle aches,
 
each reported by 9 (90%) participants with 1 participant (10%) reporting severe, 5 (50%)
 
m
oderate, and 3 (30%) mild AEs. Chills were also reported by 9 (90%) participants, with 1
 
participant (10%) reporting severe, 4 (40%) moderate, and 4 (40%) mild AEs. Headaches were
 
reported by 8 (80%) participants, 6 (60%) were moderate and 2 (20%) were mil
d in severity. An
 
elevated temperature was reported by 7 (70%) participants, 5 (50%) moderate and 2 (20%) mild
 
in severity. Joint pain was reported by 6 (60%) of participants, 2 (20%) moderate and 4 (40%)
 
mild in severity. Nausea was reported by 3 (30%) pa
rticipants, 2 (20%) moderate and 1 (10%)
 
mild in severity.
 
 
All solicited reactogenicity symptoms resolved within the 7
-
day reactogenicity collection period
 
without residual effects.
 
 
Unsolicited Adverse Events
 
 
Eight (8/10, 80%) participants 
experienced one or more unsolicited adverse events. The
 
maximum severity was potentially life
-
threatening for 1 (10%) participant, severe for six (60%),
 
and moderate for 1 (10%) participant. No SAEs or study pauses occurred.
 
 
The most common unsolicted adv
erse event was lymphopenia in 8 (80%) participants, 5 in IV
 
and 3 in SC participants, including 1 (10%) potentially life
-
threatening, 6 (60%) severe, and 1
 
(10%) mild, all of which were evaluated as related to study product. Grade [ADDRESS_110510] (5 mg/kg, SC) [ADDRESS_110511] administration and resolved in 6
 
days. All AEs of lymphopenia were asymptomatic and resolved without residual effects.
 
One (1/10, 10%) participant had moderate dyspepsia, 1 (10%) had moderate AE of elevat
ed liver
 
transaminases, 1 (10%) had mild abdominal pain, 1 (10%) had mild hypertension; these were
 
evaluated as related to study product and resolved without residual effects.
 
 
Unrelated adverse events included [ADDRESS_110512]-
injection/infusion, and evaluation for anti
-drug antibody (ADA) 
development following product exposure.  
Other assays may also be completed from stored 
samples at a later date if additional assessments are needed.

a 10% solution). 
 
2.[ADDRESS_110518] multiclade 208 Env
-pseudovirus panel was used[
30
].  The 208 pseudovirus panel 
includes the major circulating HIV
-
1 genetic clades and viruses derived f
rom acute and chronic 
stages HIV
-1 infection.  Within the 208 pseudoviruses tested, 58 are Clade C, the dominant clade 
in southern Africa.  The CAP256-VRC26.25 material used in this assay was produced in 
HEK/293expi [INVESTIGATOR_100372].  The CAP256V2LS material was prod
uced in stably transfected CHO cells 
using processes representative of the manufacturing methods used for the GMP drug product. 
CAP256V2LS was slightly broader and more potent than the parental CAP256-VRC26.25, with 
CAP256V2LS neutralizing 63% of the pseud
oviruses with a median IC
50
 of 0.001 ug/mL and 
CAP256
-VRC26.25 neutralizing 59% of the pseudoviruses with a median IC
50
 of 0.006 ug/mL.  
CAP256V2LS is particularly broad and potent in Clade C by [CONTACT_100396] 72% of the 
pseudoviruses with a median IC

of 0.001 ug/mL.
  
 
The polyspecificity of CAP256V2LS was assessed by [CONTACT_100397]-
2 cells 
by [CONTACT_100398] . VRC01LS and 4E10 were 
used as negative and positive controls respectively.  CAP256V2LS displayed no reactivity with a 
score of 0 for binding to HEp
-2 cells at 25 ug/mL.  CAP256V2LS showed higher binding to 
cardiolipin tha
n VRC01LS but was much lower than 4E10 which binds strongly to cardiolipin 
and has been administered to people in multi-dose phase I and II trials without any serious 
adverse reactions

phospholipid characteristics by [CONTACT_100399] (aPTT) was performed using methods previously described
[
32
].  
CAP256V2LS samples did not exhibit lengthening aPTT.  
The results demonstrated that 
CAP256V2LS does not have anti-phospholipid characteristics.
 
The VRC evaluated the 
in vivo
 pharmacokinetic profile of CAP256V2LS, produced from a 
stably transfected CHO cell line in human FcRn transgenic mice and rhesus macaques.

The average clearance was calculated to be 40.25 mL/Day/kg with a 
range of 32.9 to 48.9 mL/Day/kg.
 
 
A single 10 mg/kg dose of CAP
256V2LS was given to rhesus macaques via the SC (n=3) or IV 
(n=3) routes. 
 
The levels of antibody in the sera of these animals at various timepoints up to 56 
days after administration were then quantified by [CONTACT_2017]
-
CAP256V2LS idiotype based ELISA 
method. 
 
The initial sera antibody levels were higher when the antibody was given IV compared 
to SC, but by [CONTACT_4475] 2 the sera antibody levels were similar in all animals irrespective of route of 
administration and followed similar distribution over time. 
 
Also, sera 
antibody levels were 
maintained above 10 ug/mL for up to [ADDRESS_110521] infusion in all animals irrespective of route. 
The average half
-
life for CAP256V2LS was calculated to be 14.3 days for the IV route and 9.9 
days for the SC route, with a range of 5.8 day
s to 21.7 days with the half
-
lives slightly higher for 
the IV route. 
 
The AUC was a bit higher for the IV route (616 Day ug/mL) compared to the SC 
route (514 Day ug/mL) due to the higher initial peak observed in the sera levels for the IV route 
compare to 
the SC route. 
 
The clearance was similar between the two routes (15.87 mL/Day/kg 
for IV vs. 19.42 mL/Day/kg for SC).

4 STUDY DESIGN AND CLINICAL PROCEDURES
 
This Phase 1 open
-label study will be conducted at the VRC Vaccine Evaluation Clinic (VEC) in 
the NIH Clinical Center (NIH CC). 
 The primary hypothesis is that CAP256V2LS will be safe 
and tolerable when administered by [CONTACT_100400].  
The secondary hypothesis is that 
CAP256V2LS will be detectable in human sera with a definable half-
life.
   
Enrollment will begin in the 5 mg/kg IV group 
(Group 1) with no more than one subject per day 
for the first three participants to receive CAP256V2LS. 
 
Absent safety data that meet pause 
criteria, after [ADDRESS_110523] received 5 mg/kg IV in Group 1, enrollments into Group [ADDRESS_110524] 
administration schedule, also referred to as the Schedule of Evaluations 
(

Adults who are unable to provide initial informed consent are excluded to enroll. Also, adults 
who permanently lose the capacity to provide on-going consent after initial consent and during 
the study will be discontinued from protocol participation as it is described in 
Section 4.4
 
4.4.3
 
NIH Employees
 
NIH 
employees and members of their immediate families may participate in this protocol. We 
will follow the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in NIH Research Studies and will give 
each employee a copy of the “NIH Information Sheet on Employee Research P
articipation” and 
a copy of the “Leave Policy for NIH Employees Participating in NIH Medical Research 
Studies.”  
Neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on 
the participant’s employment or work situation. The NIH information sheet regarding NIH 
employee research participation will
 
be distributed
 
to all potential subjects who are NIH 
employees. The employee subject’s privacy and confidentiality will
 
be preserved
 in accordance 
with
 
NIH CC and NIAID po
licies. For NIH employee 
subjects, consent will
 be obtained by [CONTACT_100403]’s team.  
If
 
an NIH staff member seeks to enroll in 
research taking place within
 their own work unit or conducted by [CONTACT_100404], th
e 
employee will be:
  
 
•
 
Informed that neither participation nor refusal to participate as a research subject 
will have an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the subject’s employment, training 
or position at the NIH,  
 
•
 
When possible, consent should be obtained by [CONTACT_100405] a non-supervisory 
relationship with the subject, and
  
 
 
•
 
When consent is conducted, a third party (e.g. a consent monitor) 
will be included 
through the Bioethics Consultation Service
 or another party independent of the 
research t
eam or, if a consent monitor is not available, the consent process will be 
observed by [CONTACT_100406]’s work unit and not a supervisor to the NIH staff member. If no 
such person exists
, consent observation may be performed by [CONTACT_100407]. Protocol study staff will be trained on obtaining potentially 
sensitive and private information from co
-workers or subordinates.

Screening
 
All screening procedures 
for this study
 
are described and
 will be completed through the VRC’s 
screening protocol, VRC 500 (NIH 11-I-
0164) used for all VRC IND studies
 conducted at the 
NIH Clinical Center. 
 The Recruitment Plan per NIH Policy [ADDRESS_110533] (IRB)
-approved advertising.  Screening evaluations are performed to 
confirm eligibility and will include
 
medical history review, physical exam, and the clinical 
laboratory tests detailed in the Schedule of Evaluations, 
Appendix I
.  Women presumed to be of 
reproductive potential will be given a pregnancy test. No screening procedures will be done 
under protocol VRC 611. 
Additional health assessments may be conducted at screening based on clinical judgment
. 
Screening evaluations for specific eligibility criteria 
(
Section 4.1
) 
must be completed within the 
time interval specified prior to enrollment for the given parameter and may be repeated, as 
needed, to confirm eligibility. Research blood samples will be collected anytime during 
screen
ing through enrollment and will not be subject to the “84 days prior to enrollment” 
restriction.
 
 
The informed consent form (ICF) will be reviewed during screening.  
Counseling related to 
potential risks of the study product, pregnancy prevention, and avoiding exposure to HIV will be 
performed.  An Assessment of Understanding (AoU) will be completed in association with

Plan for Pausing the Study
 
The study team will closely monitor and review study data as they become available to make 
determinations regarding the presence, severity and attribution of AEs.  CAP256V2LS 
adm
inistrations and
 
new enrollments will be paused if any of the following criteria are met:
  
•
 
One
 
(or more) subject experiences a 
SAE
 
that is assessed as related (possibly, 
probably or definitely) to CAP256V2LS, or

and will only trigger a pause if there are associat
ed clinical sequelae. 
 
4.8.2
 
Plan for Review of Pauses and Resuming Rules
 
In the event of a pause, the IND Sponsor Medical Officer (MO) and the Protocol Safety Review 
Team (PSRT) will be promptly notified.
   
The IND Sponsor MO and PI, in consultation with the PSRT, will conduct a review of available 
information, including the events that lead to the pause, and will make the decision to resume, 
amend or close the study.  
As part of the pause review, the reviewe
rs may also advise on whether 
the study needs to be paused again for any subsequent events of the same type.   
Study product administrations and new enrolments 
would resume only if review of the AEs that 
caused the pause results in a recommendation to perm
it further study product administrations and
 
study enrollments.  Safety data reports and changes in study status will be submitted to relevant 
regulatory authorities in accordance with 
Section 5
 and institutional policy.

An adverse event (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with t
he subject’s participation in research, whether or not 
considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
In the context of FDA
-required 
reporting, an AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
•
 
Solicited AEs (i.e., reactogenicity parameters as defined in Section 
4.3.9
) 
will be 
recorded without attribution assessments by [CONTACT_100408] [ADDRESS_110543] administration.  
•
 
Unsolicited AEs will be recorded in the study database with attribution assessments from 
product administration through the Day [ADDRESS_110544] administration visit.
  
•
 
SAEs (as detailed in Section
 
5.2
) 
and new chronic medical conditions will be recorded as 
AEs through the last expected study visit or contact.

The term “Serious Adverse Event” (SAE) is defined in 21 CFR 312.32 as follows:  
“An a
dverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator 
or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
Death, a life
-threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life

medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.” 
“Life threatening” refers to an AE or suspected adverse reaction that represents an immediate 
risk of death to the subject. 
 It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

rights, safety, or welfare of subjects or others, or the scientific integrity or validity of the 
study.   
For the reporting purposes, failure of subjects to comply with the research protocol does not 
represent non-
compliance unless that failure is due to an action or omission of a member of the 
research team, for example, the failure to give adequate instruction to the subject.
 
A major deviation must be reported

A series of minor deviations pointing 
toward a more global issue that could affect the rights, safety or welfare of the participant or 
affect the validity of the study should be reported as a major deviation.  
In all othe

The primary goal of this study is to identify safety concerns associated with CAP256V2LS when 
administered IV or SC at the 5 mg/kg dose. 
 
Primary sample size considerations are expressed in 
terms of the ability to detect serious adverse experiences. 
 
The a
bility of the study to identify 
SAEs will be expressed in terms of the probability of observing a certain number of serious 
adverse events.
   
With sample size n=5 in a group, within each group there is over 90% chance to observe at least 
[ADDRESS_110554] 0.370 and over 90% chance to observe no SAE if the true rate is 
no more than 0.020.  With sample size n=10 in a group, within a group there is over 90% chance 
to observe at least 1 SAE if the true rate is no less than 0.206 and over 90% chance of observing 
no SAE if the true rate is no more than 0.010.  Probabilities of observing 0 or 2 or more SAE 
within a group are presented in

6.3.[ADDRESS_110559] Pharmacokinetic Analysis
:  A non-
compartmental (NC) PK analysis will 
be performed using Phoenix 7.0 (Certara
R
), PKPlus or a similar program on the CAP256V2LS 
concentration data generated from each subject.  Individual subject and route group 
concentration vs time profiles will be constructed in linear and semi
-
log s
cales.  In the NC 
analysis the maximum concentration (Cmax) and time of maximal concentration (Tmax) will be 
taken directly from the observed data.  The area under the concentrations vs. time curve (AUC) 
will be calculated using the trapezoidal method and determined out to the final concentration 
collected.  If a subjects CAP256V2LS concentration falls below the quantitative limit (QL) of 
the assay before the final of PK sample collection, the sample with concentration below the QL 
will be assigned a CAP256
V2LS concentration value of “0” for AUC calculations.   
Population Pharmacokinetic Analyses
:  Population PK analyses will be performed on the PK 
data following IV and SC administration to determine compartmental PK parameters with the 
PK program NONMEM 7.3 
or later (ICON
R
).  Based on preclinical PK results for CAP256V2LS 
and known PK behavior studies of mAbs, two-
compartment model will be used (subroutine 
ADVAN4 TRANS4).  Both zero order and first order absorption following SC administration 
will be evaluated and a lag time included if a delay is seen in the raw data figures.  The First 
Order Conditional Estimation Method with Interaction (FOCEI) will be used.  The population 
analysis will generate estimates for clearance (CL) central and peripheral volumes 
of distribution 
(Vd
1
 and Vd
2
), inter
-compartmental clearance (Q), CL and SC bioavailability (F).  Total volume 
of distribution at steady-
state (Vdss), will be calculated as the sum of Vd

CAP256V2LS is a clear, colorless to yellow liquid, essentiall
y free of visible particles; some 
opaque or translucent particles may be present. 
 CAP256V2LS is a highly concentrated protein 
solution and may develop opaque to translucent particles after thawing.  
When particles are 
observed, they may disappear after a few hours at 15°C to 27°C or storage at 2°C to 8°C. 
 
The following instructions apply to thawing CAP256V2LS:
 
1.
 
Thaw vial(s) for a minimum of 90 minutes at 15°C to 27°C after removing from the 
freezer. 
 
Vials must not be moved directly from the freezer to sto
rage at 2°C to 8°C.

Risks of mAb Administration
:  Administration of mAbs may cause immune reactions such as 
acute anaphylaxis, 
cytokine release syndrome, serum sickness and the generation of 
anti
-drug 
antibodies.  However, these reactions are rare and more often associated with mAbs targeted to 
human proteins or with the use of mouse mAbs that would have a risk of human anti-mouse 
antibodies[
33
].  In this regard, as CAP256V2LS is expected to have a low risk of such side 
effects since it is directed against a
 viral antigen and is human in origin. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the side effects of mAbs are mild to moderate and may include local reactions at the 
injection site (including pain, redness, bruising, swelling) and systemic reactions such as fever, 
chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, 
hypotension, hypertension, pruritus, rash, urticaria, angioedema, diarrhea, tachycardia or chest 
pain.  
When infused intravenously, infusion
-
related events commonly occur within the first 24 
hours after initiation of mAb administration. Infusion related reactions are common with licensed 
therapeutic mAbs, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_100380], rigors, backpain, abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, flushing, pruritus, or changes in heart rate and blood 
pressure
[
20
].  Infusion related reactions are managed by [CONTACT_86964][INVESTIGATOR_51119], 
administering histamine blockers and restarting the infusion at a slower rate
[
34
].  
Clinical use of 
mAbs that are targeted to cytokines or antigens associated with human cells may be associated 
with an increased risk of infections[
33
]; however, this is not expected to be a risk for a mAb 
targeted to a viral antigen.  
 
Published exper
ience with other human mAbs directed against cell surface targets on 
lymphocytes shows that infusion of a mAb may be associated with cytokine release, causing a 
reaction known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS
)[
35
].  
In contrast to the milder infusion 
reactions described above, CRS is rare and mechanistically associated with indiscriminate 
activation of immune cells leading to a cytokine storm characterized by [CONTACT_100418], low 
back pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, disseminated intravascular coagulation and other 
symptoms of critical illness including respi[INVESTIGATOR_100381].

Problems from use of an IV for blood drawing are generally 
mild and may include pain,

Risks of New Diagnoses: 
It is possible that the standard medical tests performed 
as part of this 
research protocol will result in new diagnoses. 
 
Depending upon the medical findings and 
consequences of being provided with the new medical information about health status, the study 
subject may view this aspect of study participation as e
ither a risk or a benefit. 
 
Any such 
information will be shared and discussed with the subject and, if requested by [CONTACT_423], will be 
forwarded to the subject’s primary health care provider for further workup and management.

Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits
 
This research study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practices 
(GCP) guidance, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
The plan for reduction of known and unknown risks to participants includes appropriate training 
of study personnel; education of study subjects for participation in care throughout the study; 
monitoring of study participants’ health status and experiences; withdrawal from study 
procedures upon evidence of difficulty, contraindication, or a significant adverse event; and 
referral for treatment, counseling or other necessary follow
-up. 
The VRC Clinical Trials
 Program 
Risk Management Plan guides the reduction and mitigation strategies applied to the known and 
unknown 
risks
 
associated
 
with
 study 
participation
 and 
to
 study operations. 
As study subjects will 
not receive direct health benefit from study participation or product administration, no alternative 
procedures are planned. The alternative course of action is to choose not to participate.

Samples will be tracked in the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database or 
using another software designed for this purpose (e.g., Freezerworks). 
8.6.3
 
Disposition of Samples, Specimens and Data at Completion of the 
Protocol
 
In the future, other investigators (both at NIH and outside) may wish to study these samples 
and/or data.  IRB approval must be sought prior to any sharing of samples with non-
NIH 
investigators and any clinical information shared about those samples would 
similarly require 
prior IRB approval. 
 The research use of stored, unlinked or unidentified samples will be exempt 
from the need for prospective IRB review and approval according to NIH IRB policy.
  
 
At the time of protocol termination, samples will remain
 at the VRC Vaccine Immunology 
Program facility or VRC laboratories or, after IRB approval, will be transferred to another 
repository.  
Regulatory oversight of the stored samples and data may be transferred to a stored 
samples protocol as part of the IRB a

Close cooperation between the designated members of the Protocol Team will occur to evaluate 
and respond to individual AEs in a timely manner.  The VRC CTP designated Sa
fety Officer 
(SO) conducts a daily safety review of clinical data per VRC CTP Standard Operating 
Procedures.
  
The Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) will be comprised of the Principal Investigator (PI), 
Associate Investigators, Study Coordinator, Protocol 
Specialists, other study clinicians, and the 
IND Medical Officer (MO). 
 
The PSRT will review the summary study safety data reports on a 
weekly basis through [ADDRESS_110583] be made
 
only with prior approval of the IND Sponsor and with 
agreement from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_52577]. 
 
All study amendments will be submitted to the IRB for 
approval.
 
The IND Sponsor, the IRB, OHRP, the PI, Protocol Chairs, and/or the FDA reserve the right to 
terminate the study.

•
 
Subject files containing completed informed consent forms and supporting copi[INVESTIGATOR_33775] (if kept).
 
•
 
Study files containing the protocol with all amendments, IBs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_100385].
 
In addition, all 
original source documentation must be maintained and be readily available.
 
 
All essential documentation should be retained by [CONTACT_52644]. 
 
The FDA requires study records to be retained
 
for up to 
two years after marketing approval or refusal (21 CFR 312.62). 
 
No study document should be 
destroyed without prior written agreement between the VRC and the investigator. 
 
Should the 
investigator wish to assign the study records to another part
y or move them to another location, 
they must notify the VRC in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location.

Details of clinical site 
monitoring are documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP).
 
 
The CMP describes in detail 
who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level
 
of 
detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports.

Data Collection
 
Clinical research data will be collected in a secure electronic web
-
based clinical data 
management system (CDMS) through a contract research organization, The Emmes Company, 
LLC (Rockville, MD). Extracted, anonymized data will be sent to the PSRT for safety review 
and to Protocol Statistician for statistical analysis.
 
9.4.2
 
Source Documents
 
The site will maintain appropriate medical and
 
research records for this trial, in compliance with 
ICH E6 (R2) GCP, applicable regulations, and institutional requirements for the protection of 
confidentiality of subjects.  
Source data are all information, original records of clinical findings, 
observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation 
of the trial. 
 Examples of these original documents and data records include, but are not limited 
to, medical records, laboratory reports, pharmacy records and o
ther research records maintained 
for the clinical trial.
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_110586], data and biological 
specimen collection, documentation and completion.  
The VEC Quality Management Plan will 
be used to perform quality management for this trial.
 
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and 
data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated.  Any missing data or data 
anomalies will be communicated to the site for clarification/resolutio
n. 
The monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted, and data are generated, and 
biological specimens are collected, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the 
protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
The site
 
will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and reports for 
the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_90471].

:
  
The AE is clearly explained by [CONTACT_33859]. 
For purposes of preparing summary data reports in which AE a
ttributions are simplified to 
“Related” or “Not Related”, in this protocol, the “Definitely, Probably and Possibly” attributions 
above will be mapped to the “Related” category, while the “Unlikely/Probably Not Related” and 
“Not Related” attributions above will be mapped to the “Not Related” category.  The definitions 
that apply when these two attribution categories alone are used are as follows:
 
•

the definitions based on size of the largest diameter and listed for the “Injection Site 
Erythema or Redness” will be used.  The severity grade definition for “Bruising” 
provided under the Dermatologic Clinical Conditions will be used only for unsolicited 
AEs involving bruising at other body locations.
 
•
 
Creatinine changes will be graded on the basis of the upper limit of normal provided by 
[CONTACT_52656]. 
•
 
Creatinine clearance changes will be graded according to ml/min provi

KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THIS RESEARCH 
This consent form describes a research study and is designed to help you decide if you would 
like to be a part of the research study.  
You are being asked to take part in a research study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
This section provides the information we believe is most helpful and important to you in making 
your decision about participating in this study. Additional information that may help you decide 
can be found in other sections of the document. Taking part in research at the NIH is your choice.
This is a study of an experimental drug called CAP256V2LS. CAP256V2LS is a monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) that targets HIV. CAP256V2LS is currently being evaluated separately in the 
South African CAPRISA 012B study. The main purpose of this study is to further evaluate if 
CAP256V2LS is safe and how your body responds to it. We also want to check if your body 
will recognize CAP256V2LS and make an immune response to it. You cannot get HIV from 
CAP256V2LS.
About 10 to 20 people will take part in this study at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. 
If you decide to take part, you will be in the study for about 24 weeks (6 months) and get 
CAP256V2LS one time in one of two ways: given into a vein in your arm, intravenously (IV), 
or as an injection in the fat under your skin, subcutaneously (SC). This information will be 
helpful for future uses of the product. This will also allow us to see how much of the antibody 
stays in the body after only one dose. If you get CAP256V2LS in the vein, it will be mixed 
with an FDA approved product called R-Gene
® 
10, that contains L-arginine, a naturally 
occurring amino acid.. R-Gene [ADDRESS_110609] 24 hours after the 
mAb is given and include local symptoms such as pain, redness, swelling, and itching. Also,

WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
HIV infection is a serious disease with no cure or vaccine to prevent it. Researchers have been 
working hard to figure out new ways to treat or prevent HIV infection. Using antibodies is one 
way to prevent HIV infection that seems promising. Antibodies are naturally made by [CONTACT_100427]. This study will test an antibody called 
CAP256V2LS. CAP256V2LS has been used in the lab to block an HIV-like virus from causing 
infection in animals. Monoclonal means that all the antibodies in CAP256V2LS are the same. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only allows it to be used for research because it 
is an experimental product.
“Experimental” means that the study mAb has not been approved by [CONTACT_33438] (FDA). The FDA allows this mAb to be used for research purposes only. R-Gene 
[ADDRESS_110611] you from HIV. 
You cannot get HIV from CAP256V2LS.
The purpose of this research study is to see if CAP256V2LS is safe and how your body responds 
to it. We will tell you if we learn anything new during this study that might cause you to change 
your mind about staying in the study. At the end of the study, we will tell you when study results 
may be available and how to learn about them.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY?
The study will have two groups as shown in the study plan table. Each group will have 5 to 10 
people in it. If you agree to take part in this study, you will only get one dose of 
CAP256LSV2LS. You will get CAP256V2LS in one of two ways; given into a vein in your arm, 
intravenously (IV), or as an injection in the fat under your skin, subcutaneously (SC). This 
information will be helpful for future uses of the product. We will tell you which group you are 
in. Your body weight is used to calculate the amount of CAP256V2LS you will get. You will be 
weighed on the day CAP256V2LS is to be given. 
You will be in the clinic for about 8 hours on the day that CAP256V2LS is given. This will allow 
us to see if the dose of the antibody is safe and how long it lasts in the body. Other clinic visits 
will take 30 minutes to 2 hours. Any participant who is assessed as being unwell or has ongoing 
symptoms will be asked to remain in the clinic until evaluation and discharge by a study 
clinician. This includes the possibility of an overnight inpatient stay to evaluate for safety. In 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_100374], acute medical care will be provided 
to participants for any immediate allergic reactions or other injury resulting from participation in 
this research study.

You may also call an NIH Clinical Center HIV counselor at [PHONE_2330].
MONITORING OF THE STUDY
This study will be monitored by a group of physicians and scientists at NIH. This group will   review 
the study information and will pay close attention to any reactions.
GENETIC TESTING
Some of the blood drawn from you during this study will be used for genetic tests. In research, 
some genetic tests are done to see if genetic differences in people cause different types of immune   
responses. Some of the genetic tests will be done in a research laboratory from your stored samples. 
The performance of these tests in the research laboratory is not for health care purposes. Your blood 
sample used in these genetic tests will not have your name [CONTACT_100448]?
If you agree to take part in this study, your involvement is expected to last for about 24 weeks (6 
months). There are 13 planned clinic visits for the IV group and 14 planned clinic visits for the SC 
group. You will be in the clinic for about 8 hours on the day that CAP256V2LS is given. Other 
clinic visits will take 30 minutes to 2 hours. You will be seen in clinic 3-4 times the week you get 
CAP256V2LS, then you will be seen weekly for 1 month, and then monthly until the end of the 
study 24 weeks later.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY?
We plan to enroll between 10 to 20 people. 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS OF BEING IN THE STUDY?
Possible Risks of CAP256V2LS
CAP256V2LS is currently being evaluated separately in the South African trial CAPRISA 012B, 
which started enrollment on July 13, 2020. As of August 23, 2021, [ADDRESS_110619] side effects were not dangerous and 
cleared up quickly. A low white blood cell count (also known as lymphocytopenia) was a common

event seen in study participants in South Africa.  White blood cells help the body fight infection 
and disease. In the CAPRISA 012B study, low white blood cell counts were seen within a day 
after participants got CAP256V2LS, and the cell counts quickly improved with no symptoms or 
other known problems. Similar decreased white blood counts were seen in 8 (80%) of participants 
in VRC 611. All of these events were detected in laboratory tests, were not associated with any 
symptoms, and resolved within a week without any residual effects.
Side effects to CAP256V2LS-like antibodies given by [CONTACT_100428], chills, 
shaking, nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, trouble breathing, high or low blood 
pressure, itchiness, rash, hives, lip or face swelling, diarrhea, racing heart, or chest pain. These 
symptoms usually go away within a few minutes to hours after the product is given. We are giving 
CAP256V2LS at a controlled rate. If you develop symptoms while CAP256V2LS is being given, 
tell the nurse right away. Slowing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_100386].
Side effects to CAP256V2LS-like antibodies given by [CONTACT_100429], 
redness and/or swelling at the site of injection. Tiredness, muscle pain outside the injection site, 
and headache have also been reported. These symptoms usually clear within [ADDRESS_110621] you think you are having.  This is important for your safety.
Possible Risks of Injections (IV or SC)
Temporary stinging, pain, redness, soreness, itchiness, swelling, discomfort or bruising.

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is a federal law that prohibits plans and 
health insurers from requesting genetic information or using genetic information.  It also prohibits 
employment discrimination based on your health information.  However, GINA does not address 
discrimination by [CONTACT_55173], disability insurance, or long-term care 
insurance.  GINA also does not protect you against discrimination based on an already-diagnosed 
condition or disease that has a genetic component.  
Possible Risks from Stored Samples
We will collect blood samples from you during the study.  We will keep these samples for future 
research indefinitely to learn more about mAbs and vaccines, the immune system, and other 
research questions. Results from research with your samples will not be in your medical record or 
reported to you.
There is a small chance that information from your medical records could be given to someone 
who should not get it without your permission. It is possible for someone to use that information 
to discriminate against you when you apply for insurance or employment. Similar problems may 
occur if you give information about yourself or agree to have your medical records released.
Labeling of Stored Samples
Your stored samples will be labeled by a special code or number and not your personal 
information. Only the study team can link this code to you. Any identifying information about you 
(like name [CONTACT_40234]) will be kept as confidential as allowable by [CONTACT_2371].
Possible Risks of Data Sharing
Information in the shared databases could be linked back to you and used to discriminate against 
you or your family. State and federal laws provide some protections against genetic and pre- 
existing conditions discrimination.
Possible Other Risks
You may not donate blood at a blood bank while taking part in this study. You may not donate 
blood for one year after CAP256V2LS injection.
What are the risks related to pregnancy?
We do not know how the experimental mAb may affect a fetus or nursing infant. Therefore, women 
who can become pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test before product administration and 
agree to use effective birth control beginning at least [ADDRESS_110623] injection until the end 
of the study. We will discuss effective methods of birth control with you.

up visits so that we can check your health.  We will ask you the outcome of the pregnancy.
There are no known or anticipated effects of CAP256V2LS on sperm.
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF BEING IN THE STUDY?
You will not benefit from being in this study.
Are there any potential benefits to others that might result from the study?
The study is not designed to protect you from HIV.  We do not know if the mAb will work.  You 
and others may benefit in the future from the information that will be learned from the study. 
WHAT OTHER OPTIONS ARE THERE FOR YOU?
Instead of being in this study, you could choose not to take part.  You may be eligible for other 
VRC studies.
 
DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS
New information about the study
If we find out any new information that may affect your choice to participate in this study, we will 
get in touch with you to explain what we have learned. This may be information we have learned 
while doing this study here at the NIH or information we have learned from other scientists doing 
similar research in other places.
Return of research results
At each visit you will be checked for any health changes or problems. Blood will be drawn at 
almost every study visit to check on your health. You will be told right away, either by [CONTACT_100430] a possible health problem.
The results of this study may be reported in medical journals, on the internet or at scientific 
meetings. We will give you information about how to find the study results once they are available.
EARLY WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
You may be removed from the research study by [CONTACT_100431]:

You don't keep appointments or follow study procedures;

You get a serious illness that needs ongoing medical care;

You become pregnant;

You need to get treatment with a medication that affects your immune system 
(such as a steroid like prednisone).

If the researcher believes that it is in your best interest to remove you from the study.

The study is stopped by [CONTACT_17513], the study sponsor or study 
investigators. If this happens, we will tell you why.
If you agree to take part in this study, it is important for you to keep all of your appointments. Your 
participation in this study is completely voluntary. You can choose to stop taking part in the study 
at any time. There is no penalty or loss of benefits if you choose to leave the study.

CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN AN NIH CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDY
STORAGE, SHARING AND FUTURE RESEARCH USING YOUR SPECIMENS AND 
DATA
Will your specimens or data be saved for use in other research studies?
As part of this study, we are obtaining specimens and data from you. We will remove all the 
identifiers, such as your name, date of birth, address, or medical record number and label your 
specimens and data with a code so that you cannot easily be identified. However, the code will be 
linked through a key to information that can identify you. We plan to store and use these specimens 
and data for studies other than the ones described in this consent form that are going on right now, 
as well as studies that may be conducted in the future. These studies may provide additional 
information that will be helpful in understanding other diseases or conditions. This could include 
studies to develop other research tests, treatments, drugs, or devices, that may lead to the 
development of a commercial product by [CONTACT_100432]/or its research or commercial partners. 
There are no plans to provide financial compensation to you if this happens. Also, it is unlikely 
that we will learn anything from these studies that may directly benefit you.
By [CONTACT_100433], you give permission for your coded specimens and data to 
be stored and used for future research as described above.
Will your specimens or data be shared for use in other research studies?
We may share your coded specimens and data with other researchers.  If we do, while we will 
maintain the code key, we will not share it, so the other researchers will not be able to identify 
you.  They may be doing research in areas that are like this study or in other unrelated areas. These 
researchers may be at NIH, other research centers and institutions, or commercial entities.
If you change your mind and do not want us to use your specimens and data for future research, 
you should contact [CONTACT_100434]. We will do 
our best to comply with your request but cannot guarantee it. For example, if research with your 
specimens and/or data has already been completed, the information from that research may still 
be used. Also, for example, if the specimens and data have been shared already with other 
researchers, it might not be possible to withdraw them. 
If you change your mind and do not want us to store and use your specimens and data for future 
research, you should contact [CONTACT_100434]. 
We will do our best to comply with your request but cannot guarantee it. For example, if research

By [CONTACT_100433], you give permission for your coded specimens and data to 
be shared with other researchers and used by [CONTACT_100435].
In addition to the planned use and sharing described above, we might remove all identifiers and 
codes from your specimens and data and use or share them with other researchers for future 
research at the NIH or other places.  When we or the other researchers access your anonymized 
data, there will be no way to link the specimens or data back to you.  We will not contact [CONTACT_100436].  If we do this, we would not be

number; and your data will be labeled with only a code. We cannot offer you a choice of whether 
your data to be placed in this database or not.  If you do not wish to have your data placed in this 
database, you should not enroll in this study.  
How long will your specimens and data be stored by [CONTACT_18121]?
Your specimens and data may be stored by [CONTACT_100437]. 
Risks of storage and sharing of specimens and data
When we store your specimens and data
,
 we take precautions to protect your information from 
others that should not have access to it. When we share your specimens and data, we will do 
everything we can to protect your identity, for example, when appropriate, we remove information 
that can identify you. Even with the safeguards we put in place, we cannot guarantee that your 
identity will never become known, or someone may gain unauthorized access to your information. 
New methods may be created in the future that could make it possible to re-identify your specimens 
and data.
PAYMENT
Will you receive any type of payment for taking part in this study?
Some NIH Clinical Center studies offer compensation for participation in research. The amount of 
compensation, if any, is guided by [CONTACT_100438]. You will be compensated for your 
time and inconvenience by [CONTACT_100439]. It is possible that you 
may have some expenses that are not covered by [CONTACT_33877].

$200. You will get $25 total for the timely completion of all 7 days of an electronic diary. You 
will get $200 for each scheduled follow-up visit that includes a blood draw. You will get $85 for 
each follow up visit that does not include a blood draw. 
If you are enrolled in Group 1, the total compensation for completion of all study visits is about 
$2655. If you are enrolled in Group 2, the total compensation for completion of all study visits is 
about $2855. 
The total compensation you get is based on the number and type of study visits you complete. You 
will get the compensation about [ADDRESS_110628] unpaid debt to the federal government, please be aware that some or all of

CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN AN NIH CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDY
With few exceptions, study compensation is considered taxable income that is reportable to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A “Form 1099-Other Income” will be sent to you if your total 
payments for research participation are $600 or more in a calendar year.
We will need your social security number to process your compensation. You can still take part in 
the study if you don’t give us your social security number, but you might not be able to get your 
compensation.
 
REIMBURSEMENT
Will you receive reimbursement or direct payment by [CONTACT_100440]?
Some NIH Clinical Center studies offer reimbursement or payment for travel, lodging or meals 
while participating in the research. The amount, if any, is guided by [CONTACT_100438]. 
This study does not offer reimbursement for, or payment of, travel, lodging or meals.
COSTS
Will taking part in this research study cost you anything?
NIH does not bill health insurance companies or participants for any research or related clinical 
care that you receive at the NIH Clinical Center. 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST (COI) 
The NIH reviews NIH staff researchers at least yearly for conflicts of interest.  This process is 
detailed in a COI Guide.  You may ask your research team for a copy of the COI Guide or for more 
information.  Members of the research team who do not work for NIH are expected to follow these 
guidelines or the guidelines of their home institution, but they do not need to report their personal 
finances to the NIH.
The NIH and a VRC research team have developed CAP256V2LS being used in this study. This 
means it is possible that the results of this study could lead to payments to NIH. By [CONTACT_2371], the 
government is required to share such payments with the employee inventors. You will not receive 
any money from the development of CAP256V2LS.
 
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION AND RESULTS REPORTING

research may be inadvertently released or improperly accessed by [CONTACT_35532].
In most cases, the NIH will not release any identifiable information collected about you without 
your written permission.  However, your information may be shared as described in the section of 
this document on sharing of specimens and data, and as further outlined in the following sections.  
Further, the information collected for this study is protected by [CONTACT_100441] a Certificate of 
Confidentiality and the Privacy Act. 
Certificate of Confidentiality
To help us protect your privacy, the NIH Intramural Program has received a Certificate of 
Confidentiality (Certificate). With this certificate, researchers may not release or use data or 
information about you except in certain circumstances.  
NIH researchers must not share information that may identify you in any federal, state, or local 
civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, for example, if requested by a 
court.  
The Certificate does not protect your information when it:  
1. is disclosed to people connected with the research, for example, information may be used 
for auditing or program evaluation internally by [CONTACT_18121]; or 
2. is required to be disclosed by [CONTACT_4496], State, or local laws, for example, when information 
must be disclosed to meet the legal requirements of the federal Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA); 
3. is for other research;
4. is disclosed with your consent. 
The Certificate does not prevent you from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your 
involvement in this research. 
The Certificate will not be used to prevent disclosure to state or local authorities of harm to self or 
others including, for example, child abuse and neglect, and by [CONTACT_100442]. Other permissions for release may be made by [CONTACT_100443], such as the Notice 
and Acknowledgement of Information Practices consent.
Privacy Act
The Federal Privacy Act generally protects the confidentiality of your NIH medical information 
that we collect under the authority of the Public Health Service Act.  In some cases, the Privacy 
Act protections differ from the Certificate of Confidentiality.  For example, sometimes the Privacy 
Act allows release of information from your record without your permission, for example, if it is 
requested by [CONTACT_100444]. Information may also be released for certain research purposes with due 
consideration and protection, to those engaged by [CONTACT_100445], to certain 
federal and state agencies, for HIV partner notification, for infectious disease or abuse or neglect 
reporting, to tumor registries, for quality assessment and medical audits, or when the NIH is

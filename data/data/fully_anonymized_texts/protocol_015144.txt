Clinical Trial Protocol: ADX-102-AC-[ADDRESS_857714] medical occurrence associated with the use of  IP in 
humans, whether or not considered  IP-related. An AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an I P, without any judgment about ca usality. An AE can arise 
from any use of the IP (e.g., off-label use, use in combination  with another drug or 
medical device) and from any route of administration, formulati on, or dose, including an 
overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or u se of a medical device, 
including medical device failure, subject characteristics that may impact medical device 
performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic par ameters (e.g., energy 
applied, sizing, dose release, a nd anatomic fit) associated with medical device use. 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423], in response to a n open question from 
clinical trial personnel, or re vealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document a nd on the appropriate 
pages of the eCRF. Any clinically  relevant deterioration in cli nical finding is considered 
an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms i ndicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. Any pre-existing 
medical condition that worsens after administration of study me dication will also be 
considered a new adverse event . Study medication includes the d rug under evaluation or 
any other medications required by [CONTACT_640923]. 
Ocular complaints should not be ad dressed as AEs unless the com plaint is outside the 
normal limits for allergic conjunctivitis symptoms after allerg en exposure or is associated 
with clinical sequelae (i.e., adve rse slit lamp examination fin ding).

 Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature,  date of onset, end date, 
severity, and relationship to IP , action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_640924].

administration.  The following cha racterizations will be used:  
 Definitely Related 
 Probably Related 
 Possibly Related 
 Unlikely to be related 
 Not Related 
10.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using t hese explanations: 
 Unexpected :  an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the s pecificity or 
severity that has been observed. 
 Expected :  an AE that is liste d in the IB at the sp ecificity and severity that has been 
observed. 
 Not applicable:  an AE unrelated to the IP.

 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the inves tigator or Sponsor/designee, 
the AE results in any of t he following outcomes: 
 death; 
 a life-threatening AE; 
Note:  An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view o f either the 
investigator or Sponsor/designee, the subject at immediate risk  of death as a result 
of the AE.  "Life threatening" does not include an AE that, had  it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. 
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_331325]; 
Note:  The term “inpatient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpat ient admission (even 
if less than 24 hours).  For chr onic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive car e inpatient unit.  
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]:  emergency room vis its; 
outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures; or admission to obse rvation/short 
stay units, rehabilitation facili ties, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593], nursing homes, or clinical 
research/Phase 1 units. 
Note:  The term “prolongation of  existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refe rs to any extension 
of an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640921], as determined by [CONTACT_640925]. 
 a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruptio n of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; and 
Note:  A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to vi sual threat would 
be interpreted as any potential im pairment or damage to the sub ject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer, or damage to the optic 
nerve). 
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulation s and governing health 
authorities and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Collection of  AEs/SAEs will begin at 
the time of informed consent and may be recorded up until [ADDRESS_857720]-instillation of IP. 
10.3.1 Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction 
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to Ora, Inc., the Sponsor 
and the IRB/IEC as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, fed eral, state, or local regulations and 
governing health authorities. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_857721]  be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.  The investigat or is obligated to pursue and obtain information 
requested by [CONTACT_261245], Inc. and/or th e Sponsor/designee in addition to that information 
reported on the eCRF.  All subjects experiencing a SAE must be followed up and the 
outcome reported.  
In the event of a SAE, the inves tigator must notify the appropriate contact [CONTACT_640926]; obtain and maintain all pertinent medical records,  
information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted  in the treatment and 
follow-up of the subject; provide Ora, Inc. and the Sponsor/des ignee a complete case 
history, which includes a statement as to whether the event was  or was not suspected to 
be related to the use of the IP; and inform the IRB of the SAE in a manner according to 
the IRB guidelines for reporting SAEs.  
 Procedures for Unmasking (if applicable) 
When medically necessary, the i nvestigator may need to determin e what treatment has 
been assigned to a subject.  The investigator should make every  effort to contact [CONTACT_261245], Inc. 
to discuss the subject’s emergency situation and the need to un mask a clinical trial 
subject prior to unmasking IP.   
If the investigator determines that emergency unmasking is nece ssary, the investigator 
should identify the given subject’s clinical trial drug kit, wh ich contains a scratch-off 
laminate under which the treatment is identified along with the  associated lot number. In 
order to unmask, the investigator should scratch off the lamina te, using a flat object and 
applying pressure, to reveal the  treatment assigned for that su bject. The emergency 
unmasking should be performed by [CONTACT_261238].   The investigator must 
also indicate in source documents and in the eCRF that the mask  was broken and provide 
the date, time, and reason for breaking the mask.  Any AE or SA E associated with

Clinical Trial Protocol: ADX-102-AC-[ADDRESS_857726] 
The IP is to only be prescribed by [CONTACT_458] o r the named sub-
investigator(s), and is to only be used in accordance with this  protocol. The IP must only 
be distributed to subjects properly qualified under this protocol to receive IP. 
The investigator must keep an accurate accounting of the IP rec eived from the supplier. 
This includes the amount of IP dispensed to subjects, amount of  IP returned to the 
investigator by [CONTACT_748], and the amount returned or disposed upon the completion of 
the clinical trial. A detailed inventory must be completed for the IP. 
12.5.[ADDRESS_857727] 
At the conclusion of the clinical trial, IP reconciliation will  be performed and all 
remaining IP will be destructed and disposed of according to cl inical site’s SOP. Sponsor 
will be provided with a final accounting of IP for approval prior to destruction. 
 Recording of Data on Source Documents and Electronic Case 
Reports Forms (eCRFs) 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring clinical trial dat a is completely and accurately 
recorded on each subject’s eCRF, source document, and all clini cal trial-related material. 
All clinical trial data should also be attributable, legible, c ontemporaneous, and original. 
Recorded datum should only be corrected in a manner that does not obliterate, destroy, or 
render illegible the previous entry (e.g., by [CONTACT_740] a single line through the incorrect 
entry and writing the revision next to the corrected data). An individual who has 
corrected a data entry should ma ke clear who made the correctio n and when, by [CONTACT_640930]/her initials as well as the date of the corr ection. 
Data entry of all enrolled and randomized subjects will use software that conforms to [ADDRESS_857728] discs (CDs) contai ning copi[INVESTIGATOR_597732] s ubjects’ eCRFs will be 
provided to each investigator site to be maintained on file by [CONTACT_093].

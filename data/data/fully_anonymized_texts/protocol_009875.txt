Study Design:  The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate whether most 
closely HLA-matched multivirus-specific T cell lines obtained from a bank of allogeneic virus-specific T cell lines (VSTs) have antiviral activity against five viruses: BK virus, HHV6, EBV, CMV and adenovirus. 
   Reconstitution of anti-viral immunity by [CONTACT_48919]-derived VSTs has 
shown promise in preventing and treating infections associated with CMV, EBV and adenovirus post-transplant. More recently, an ongoing phase I/II study at our institution indicates that this 
approach can be extended to include additional viruses including 
BK virus and HHV6. However, the time taken to prepare patient-specific products and lack of virus-specific memory T cells in cord blood and seronegative donors, limits their value.  
  An alternative is to use banked partially HLA-matched allogeneic 
VSTs. A prior phase II study at our institution using trivirus-specific VSTs generated using monocytes and EBV-transformed B cells gene-modified with a clinical grade adenoviral vector expressing CMV-pp65 to activate and expand specific T cells showed the feasibility, safety and activity of this approach for the treatment of 
refractory CMV, EBV and Adenovirus infections. However, the 
production process was lengthy, requiring 8-12 weeks, with exposure to biohazards (B95.8 EBV viral strain and adenovector), while antigenic competition between different viral components precluded increasing the spectrum of specificity beyond these three 
viruses. 
 
 We have overcome these limitations and in the current trial, we will 
evaluate whether rapi[INVESTIGATOR_871851], allogeneic most closely HLA-matched multivirus-specific VSTs, activated using overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_871852], 
HHV6, CMV, adenovirus and EBV will be safe and produce anti-
viral effects in allogeneic HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_871853]-viral therapy. The study agent will be assessed for safety (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_699572]) and antiviral activity. 
 Primary Objective:  The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_871854]-matched VSTs specific for five virsues in HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_871855] v1.0 (10.30.13)  Version 5.0 (10.6.15)

Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives are to determine: effects of partially HLA-
matched VST infusion on viral load and viral reactivations within [ADDRESS_1217710] infusions, effects of HLA matching with clinical response and overall survival.  
 Eligibility:  Patients will be eligible following any type of allogeneic transplant if they have BK virus, HHV6, CMV, adenovirus and/or EBV infection 
persistent despi[INVESTIGATOR_14482] (as defined in section 2.3). In 
addition patients with progressive or persistent JC virus infection (which is highly homologous to BK virus) may also be enrolled. If patients are receiving steroids for treatment of GVHD or for other reasons, dosage must have been tapered to 0.5 mg/kg/day 
Prednisone (or equivalent) prior to study enrollment. Patients may 
not have received ATG, or Campath or other immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies in the last 28 days. 
 Treatment Description: The treatment schedule is as follows: 
 Patients will receive 2 x 10
7partially HLA-matched VSTs/m2 as a 
single infusion. In the rare case where insufficient banked cell 
product is available, a lower number of cells may be infused after discussion with the principal investigator, patient and/or guardian and the treatment team. If they have a partial response (as defined by a 50% fall in viral load) they are eligible to receive up to 4 
additional doses from day 28 after the initial infusion and at 2 weekly 
intervals thereafter. The viral load of the virus (or viruses) that patients are initially treated for must be monitored by [CONTACT_871896]. GVHD scores will be recorded at the intervals defined.  
 
Accrual Objective:  A maximum of [ADDRESS_1217711] one infusion of VSTs. 
 
Accrual Period: The estimated accrual period is 4 years. 
 
Study Duration: Patients will be followed for toxicity for 28 days, acute GVHD for 6 
weeks; anti-viral responses for up to [ADDRESS_1217712] 
infusion.

Page [ADDRESS_1217718] Transplant 
Viral infections are normally controlled by T-cell immunity. Thus, in the immunocompromised setting (e.g. the period of immune recovery after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)) 
viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Risk for infection is dictated by [CONTACT_871898][INVESTIGATOR_841], and the resultant degree of immunosuppression, and by [CONTACT_871899]. Reactivation of latent viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), BK virus, Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 
are common and often cause symptomatic disease. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_871856]. Antiviral pharmacologic agents are only effective against some of these viruses; their use is costly, and associated with significant toxicities and the outgrowth of drug-resistant mutants. As delay in recovery of virus-specific cellular immune response is clearly 
associated with viral reactivation and disease in these patients, cellular immunotherapy to restore 
viral-specific immunity is an attractive option that has already been successfully used to target 
some of these viruses.  
1.2 CMV 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a latent beta-herpesv irus that usually causes an asymptomatic 
infection in immunocompetent individuals. It persists in approximately 70% of healthy adults and replicates in epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], fibroblasts and monocytes. Reactivation of CMV in the stem cell 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_871857], with clinical manifestations including interstitial pneumonitis, gastroenteritis, fevers, hepatitis, encephalitis and retinitis.
[ADDRESS_1217719] important factor  in controlling CMV infection and CMV-specific 
CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes play an important role in immune protection from both primary 
infection and subsequent reactivations. The most frequently used drugs for prophylactic or preemptive therapy are ganciclovir and foscar net. These drugs have been successful in reducing 
mortality associated with CMV disease and in preventing early CMV disease in combination with intravenous immune globulin, but both have major side effects including neutropenia and nephrotoxocity.   1.3 Epstein-Barr Virus 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma-herpesvirus that infects more than 95% of the world's 
population. Primary infection usually produces a mild self-limiting disease, which is followed by [CONTACT_871900] B cells and productive replication in B cells and mucosal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. There are at least four types of viral latency, which differ in their viral antigen expression patterns.
2 In 
immunocompromised hosts, outgrowth of B cells expressing Type 3 latency (expression of all seven latency associated proteins)may l ead to the development of post-transplant 
lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). The overall incidence of PTLD after HSCT is approximately 1%, but the incidence is increased in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_871858]-leukocyte-antigen (HLA)-mismatched 
donors who receive grafts that are selectively depleted of T cells to prevent graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD).
3-5PTLD is highly susceptible to control by [CONTACT_166193]-specific T cells6;7. 
 
Few small molecule drugs have any effect on  B cells already transformed by [CONTACT_871901]. Conventional chemotherapy, while  effective in some cases is associated 
with significant toxicity with high treatment related mortality in the HSCT patient population. One

depletes normal B-cells for more than [ADDRESS_1217721] adenovirus species (A to F), which differ in their tissue specificity 
and virulence. Although causing acute infections, adenoviruses may persist for many months after 
resolution of disease and therefore are frequently carried undetected into the transplant by [CONTACT_871902][INVESTIGATOR_841]. While acute infection is rarely fatal in healthy adults, it is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, in whom it may produce pneumonia, hemorrhagic cystitis, nephritis, colitis, hepatitis, and encephalitis. Adenovirus has a particularly high incidence after pediatric HSCT.
[ADDRESS_1217722] shown that clearance of adenovirus 
infection is associated with detection of adenovirus-specific T cells11;[ADDRESS_1217723] frequently used drug for 
disease treatment is Cidofovir13, but the associated nephrotoxicity is a major concern. Moreover, 
in the absence of prospective, randomized, controlled trials, the efficacy of the drug is uncertain.  
 
1.5 BK virus 
Human polyomavirus type I, commonly called BK virus (BKV), infects 50% to 90% of humans 
worldwide before the age of [ADDRESS_1217724] often corresponds to secondary BKV replication with impaired 
polyomavirus-specific cellular immunity. Uri nary shedding of BKV occurs in 60-80% of HSCT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]14. The major disease linked to high-level polyomavirus replication is BKV-associated 
hemorrhagic cystitis (PVHC), which affects 5-15% of HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_319233] 3-[ADDRESS_1217725]-
transplant. BKV viruria reaching high viral loads of>107 genome equivalents/mL is observed in 
20-80% of HSCT patients, but less than one fifth of HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_871859].  
No clear standard treatment is defined -cidofovir
15 has been administered intravenously in a low 
dose (i.e. up to 1 mg/kg 3 times weekly, without probenecid) or a high dose (i.e., 5 mg/kg per 
week with probenecid) to HSCT patients with BK infections but no randomized trials are available proving its clinical efficacy. Ther e is no evidence to support the use of cidofovir for pre-emptive 
treatment of asymptomatic HSCT patients who develop BK viruria or viremia.  Ciprofloxacin can 
inhibit BKV replication in tissue culture, but only scant data exists regarding its efficacy after 
HSCT
16, and is limited mostly to the prophylactic setting. In small trials leflunomide had some 
activity against BK virus17; therefore we will consider this agent an acceptable alternative to 
cidofovir, given the absence of a clear first line option.   1.6 HHV6 
Nearly all children are infected with Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) by 3 years of age and the 
viruses causes the classic childhood illness roseola. After primary infection, HHV-6 remains latent 
in lymphocytes and monocytes unless the immune sy stem is compromised, at which time the 
virus may reactivate
18;19. HHV6 is increasingly recognized as an important cause of morbidity and 
mortality in patients after HSCT, with viremia occurring in 40 to 60% of transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

Page 10 of 45 HHV-6 infection generally occurs earlier than CMV infection. The median time to onset in 
accumulated studies has been shown to be 22 days and up to 70% of infections occur within the first [ADDRESS_1217726] transplant, with viremia occurring in approximately 40-60% of patients. In bone marrow transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], there is clearly an association between HHV6, marrow suppression and delayed engraftment and HHV6 very likely is a contributor to graft rejection. There are emerging data to show that it is an important cause of encephalitis in bone marrow transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The presentation of HHV-[ADDRESS_1217727] 
a role in treating HHV6-associated disease, however response is not consistent and the associated nephrotoxicity and myelosuppression remains a major concern.

1.7 Treatment of Patients with JC virus  
 
Human polyomavirus type I, commonly called BK virus (BKV), and the highly homologous human 
polyomavirus type II, commonly called JC virus (JCV), infect 50-90% of humans worldwide before 
the age of [ADDRESS_1217728] feared complications is the rare, but generally fatal progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is associated wi th the destruction of oligodendrocytes by [CONTACT_871903]. 
Therapeutic options are limited and no recognized standard therapy exists. Isolated case reports 
had suggested a possible benefit of mefloquine, however a recent open-label, randomized, 
parallel-group, proof-of-concept study found no evidence of anti JCV activity by [CONTACT_871904]46.  
 
 
1.8  Adoptive Immunotherapy with virus-specific T cells 
Since recovery of virus-specific T cells is clearly associated with protection from infection with 
each of these viruses,11;20;21 adoptive immunotherapy to decrease the time to immune 
reconstitution is an attractive approach. Virus-specific T cells generated by [CONTACT_871905] (APCs) expressi ng viral antigens have been evaluated in clinical 
trials to prevent and treat viral infections in immunocompromised hosts.
22-26This approach

limits the use of some types and sources of antigen.

immunity, CMV-specific T-cell clones were derived from sibling donors after stimulation with 
autologous fibroblasts pulsed with CMV.
25 There were no adverse effects and CMV-specific 
immune responses were reconstituted, with none of the patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_871861]. In another prophylaxis study, Peggs et al., generated CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by [CONTACT_871906] (PBMC) with dendritic cells pulsed 
with CMV antigens derived from a CMV-infected human lung fibroblast cell line
26. Small doses of 
VSTs were able to reconstitute immunity with considerable in vivo  expansion of CMV-specific 
VSTs. To avoid the use of live CMV during T cell manufacture, a more recent study stimulated 
VSTs with dendritic cells pulsed with the HLA-A2 restricted peptide NLV derived from the cytomegalovirus-pp65 protein.
[ADDRESS_1217731] approach is the interferon (IFN) γ-capture 
assay, which isolates IFN γ-secreting T cells after antigen exposure. Another approach is using a 
MHC-peptide-multimer-construct, e.g. streptamer selection.  
[IP_ADDRESS] IFN γ-capture of CMV-specific T cells 
Feuchtinger and colleagues used IFNγ -captured CMV-specific T cells to treat chemorefractory 
CMV disease or reactivation after allogeneic HSCT . After short-term stimulation and selection a 
mean of 21.3 × 10
3 CD3+ cells per kg was infused to 18 patients, without acute side effects and 
only a single case of GVHD. In 15 of 18 infused patients clearance of CMV viremia or a significant 
reduction (>1 log) of viral load was associated with the adoptive transfer. Peggs et al also reported the clinical results associated with the adoptive transfer of IFN γ-captured CMV-specific T cells. In 
this prophylaxis/preemptive treatment study, pp65 protein or peptide pools were used to stimulate T cells. Post-selection a median of 2840 CD4+ and 630 CD8+ CMV-specific T cells/kg were 
infused early (median day 35) post-transplant and expansion of both populations was detected in

Multimer techniques such as tetramers have also been developed for the direct selection of 
antigen-specific T cells. For example Cobbold and colleagues performed a clinical trial using 
tetramer selection of CMV peptide-specific T cells directly from peripheral blood. Cells were infused to patients within 4 hours of selection. Although exclusively CD8+ T cells were infused, 
they expanded by [CONTACT_871907], clearing infection in 8/[ADDRESS_1217733] clinical experience of streptamer-selected CMV-specific T cells
30. After a single 
infusion of 2.2 × 105 HLA-B7+/CMV pp65-specific CD8+ T cells/kg (purity of 97%), the frequency 
of CMV-specific T cells increased dramatically in vivo from 0% prior to infusion to a maximum of 27.1% of all T cells. These T cells were confirmed to be donor in origin by [CONTACT_871908]-tandem repeats, T cell receptor excision circles, and V β-chain typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Clinically, the T cell infusion resulted in CMV clearance without alloreactivity. 
Though both approaches have been associated with clinical benefit, the multimer strategy is 
limited by [CONTACT_871909], the availability of clinical grade multimers and lack of HLA class II multimers. Additionally, both the multimer and IFNγ  approaches require large 
numbers of starting peripheral blood material, which may not always be readily available (e.g. from an unrelated donor).

APCs in clinical studies evaluating EBV specific VSTs.

transferred EBV-specific VSTs can survive for >10 years, expand up to 2-4 logs after infusion, 
and reduce the high virus load that is observed in about 20% of patients.6;7;24In a recent review of

treated and 7 had clinical responses. No significant toxicities were seen in these studies. Finally, Uhlin and colleagues isolated, using multimers, HLA A2-restricted T cells specific for epi[INVESTIGATOR_871863] v1.0 (10.30.13)  Version 5.0 (10.6.15)

produced a complete clinical response. At 12 months after transplant the EBV-PTLD recurred, 
but a second multimer selection and infusion induced a second response. 
 
1.8.3 Therapy with VSTs specific for Adenovirus. 
Feuchtinger et al. treated patients with adenovirus infection using CD4+ and CD8+ adenovirus-
specific T cells isolated from the donor after a short in vitro stimulation with adenovirus viral 
antigen followed by [CONTACT_871911] γ-secreting cells.[ADDRESS_1217738]-

or APCs present in peripheral blood to activate virus-specific T cells. To first assess whether plasmids could substitute for EBV-LCL/adenovec tors we generate clinical grade plasmids 
encoding immunogenic EBV (EBNA1, LMP2, BZLF1), CMV (IE1, pp65) and adenovirus (Hexon, Penton) antigens and used DCs nucleofected with these plasmids to generate trivirus-specific T cells, which were expanded in vivo in the presence of the cytokines IL4+[ADDRESS_1217739] recently completed a phase I/II treatment study, achieving a response rate of 80% in patients

antigens from [ADDRESS_1217740] and therefore including these two viruses in addition to adenovirus, 
EBV and CMV in a multivirus cellular immunotherapy strategy that targets all five of these viruses 
significantly increases clinical utility.

[IP_ADDRESS] Generation of multivirus-directed VSTs by [CONTACT_871912]. 
We have developed a 10-day GMP-compliant T cell production process to generate T cell lines 
with simultaneous specificity for 5 viruses (Adv, EBV, CMV, BK and HHV6). To activate PBMCs 
we expose PBMCs directly to a mastermix of pepmixes (peptide libraries of 15mer peptides 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_10373] 11 amino acids) spanning imm unogenic antigens derived from each virus; - 
adenovirus (Hexon and Penton), CMV (IE1 and pp65), EBV (LMP2, EBNA1, BZLF1), BK virus 
(VP1 and large T), and HHV6 (U90,U11 and U14). After activation cells are transferred to a G-
Rex10 device for 9-11 days and cultured in media containing IL4 and IL7 to achieve maximal expansion of antigen-specific T cells without carry-over of alloreactive T cells

numbers of 15x106 PBMCs/G-Rex we were reproducibly able to produce 1-1.[ADDRESS_1217741] the stimulating viruses detectable in both the CD4+ and the

(57±5%) and CD8+ (35±5%) cells and retained expression of the memory markers CD45RO+CD62L+ (58±8%). Their specificity was dependent on the prior viral exposure of the cell donor; 32/[ADDRESS_1217743] Adv, 20/[ADDRESS_1217744] CMV, 26/[ADDRESS_1217745] EBV, 18/[ADDRESS_1217746] BK and 21/[ADDRESS_1217747] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353343] –

 We administered these multivirus-specific donor-derived VSTs to [ADDRESS_1217748] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190845] a dose escalation study; 4 on DL1 (5x10
6/m2), 4 on DL2 (1x107/m2) and 2 on DL3 (2x107/m2). 
There were no immediate infusion toxicities, and no de novo acute GvHD, demonstrating the in vivo safety of these mVST. Three patients received the cells as viral prophylaxis (days 38-[ADDRESS_1217749]) and none developed viral infections at up to [ADDRESS_1217750]-infusion, the VSTs were successful in controlling active infections with CMV (1 comp lete (CR) and 1 partial response (PR)), EBV (2 
CRs, including a case of frank PTLD); Adv (1 CR); HHV6 (1 CR); and BK (3 CR, 1 PR, 1NR). Of 
note, 3 BK virus responders had tissue disease with severe hemorrhagic cystitis and all had 
marked improvement or disappearance of hematuria following infusion. One patient subsequently had an epi[INVESTIGATOR_871866] a 6 log fall in urine BK viral load. Our only non-responder was a patient with BK infection whose line lacked activity for this virus, likely reflecting the serostatus of the donor. In addition, 3 patients subsequently reactivated other viruses than those for which they 
were initially treated, but all cleared these infections by [CONTACT_5875] 12, without the requirement for 
additional cell infusions (CMV: 1CR; EBV: 1CR; BK: 1CR; HHV6: 1CR). Finally, [ADDRESS_1217751] treatment there was an immediate decline in the patient’s EBV viral load with complete and sustained resolution of PTLD,

1.11Risks of Administering Virus specific VSTs 
1.11.1 Risk of Administering Donor-derived VSTs 
We recently reviewed the infusion-related adverse events (AE) following administration of ex vivo-
expanded T cell products (antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, allodepleted T cells, and 
genetically modified T cells) on investigational new drug (IND) studies in our center42. From [ADDRESS_1217758]-transplant viral infections. There were no grade 
3-4 infusion reactions during initial monitoring or 24-h follow-up. Twenty-four mild (grade 1-2) AE 
occurred in 21 infusions either during or immediately following infusion (up to 6hrs), most 
commonly nausea and vomiting (41.6%), probably because of the dimethyl 
sulfoxidecryoprotectant, and hypotension (20.8%), attributable to diphenhydramine pre-
medication. Twenty-two additional non-severe events were reported within [ADDRESS_1217759] 
commonly culture-negative fever, chills and nausea. An increased risk of AEs was associated 
with age [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.00, P = 0.05], while 
an increased risk of immediate infusion-related events was higher in patients reporting allergies 
(IRR 2.72, 95% CI 1.00-7.40, P = 0.05); sex, disease type and T cell source (allogeneic or 
autologous) had no effect on frequency of adverse events42.  
 
Focusing specifically on VSTs, over [ADDRESS_1217760] majority (123 ) occurred with no or minimal toxicity consisting 
mainly of localized swelling at sites of responsive disease. Two patients infused with donor-
specific products developed syndromes consist ent with systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome (SIRS). The first patient was infused with EBV VSTs as treatment for bulky disease 
including extensive pharyngeal disease. He had a vigorous inflammatory response with an 
immune infiltrate of genetically marked cells apparent on follow up biopsy. This response 
produced progressive airway obstruction and mucosal sloughing, ultimately requiring mechanical 
ventilation. He also had reversible cardiac impairment and fevers during this response. This 
patient subsequently made a full recovery and remains well more than [ADDRESS_1217761]

were no immediate adverse effects, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_871870], de novo GVHD occurred in only 2 patients (grade I in each case). In the [ADDRESS_1217765] infusion (grade I in 6 patients, grade II in 1 patient, and grade III in 1 patient), 6 had a history of GVHD prior to receiving the VSTs. An additional patient had a flare of chronic skin GVHD. Two patients experienced transplant-

current protocol would be difficult for two reason s. First, many recipi[INVESTIGATOR_871871]-transplant lymphocytes available to make PHA blasts and their blood at the time of study eligibility determination would be of donor origin and therefore not a valid predictive target. 
Second, it would add [ADDRESS_1217767], any patient with pre-existing GVHD of ≥ Grade 2 will be excluded from the study. Second, we will administer VSTs

matched VSTs in transplant patients with  BK virus, HHV6, EBV, CMV, and/or adenovirus

and have clinical activity in a Phase I study using the same T cell product in the donor-specific 
setting. Because the persistence of adoptively transferred cells may be shorter using a partially HLA-matched banked VST product, we have included an option of administering additional doses in subjects that have a partial response after one dose.  
 
It is unclear what degree of matching will be needed for clinical activity so we propose to allow infusion of lines that match at only one antigen, with expected antiviral activity against the infecting

agent of choice and foscarnet or cidofovir being effective second line agents. For EBV infection, rituximab is the current treatment of choice for patients with CD20+ lymphoma. For patients with CD20- tumors there is no clear standard of therapy although most physicians would likely administer chemotherapy. There is also no clear standard therapy for adenovirus or BK virus, 
although there are reports of cidofovir having acti vity. We have therefore chosen to use cidofovir 
as standard therapy for both these infections although this requirement would be waived if the subject could not tolerate this agent due to nephrotoxicity. Ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet have variable in vitro activity against HHV-6, and may have a role in treating HHV-6-associated disease. Hence standard therapy will include treatment with one or more of these agents.  2.3 Eligibility 2.3.1 Inclusion Criteria

CMV, HHV6 and BK virus are used to generate our multivirus-specific VSTs. No pepmix specific for the rare JC virus is used for generation of these CTLs, however given the high homology (>90%) between JC and BK and the fact that BK virus-specific T cells targeting VP1 and Large T (as targeted in our multivirus VSTs) have been administered to treat JCV-PML, resulting in viral clearance from the ce rebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_871876]. Given the current lack of treatment options for JC virus infection or reactivation after HSCT and the risk of progression to JML, which is almost uniformly fatal, and the apparent activity of BK virus-directed T cells against JC virus infected cells, we propose including patients with progressive or persistent JC virus on this study, unless a suitable alternat ive therapy is available.

A) Lines that were previously manufactured for our IRB approved protocol H29966. These donors were initially chosen as transplant donors because they were the best match with 
the original transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_871878]. There are either additional 
vials available after the product was used in the donor-specific setting, or was not infused either because the original recipi[INVESTIGATOR_871879]. These donors gave consent for lines not used for the original recipi[INVESTIGATOR_871880]. 
 
B. Additional lines manufactured for third party use from individuals with common HLA types on an IRB approved protocol. Some of these individuals will be subjects who have previously enrolled on our IRB approved resear ch study (H7634) to manufacture CTL lines 
from normal donors for preclinical studies so that we know that their lines have broad antivirus reactivity. We will approach these don ors previously enrolled on this study to 
ascertain if they are willing to enroll and donate blood for the current study. We may also collaborate with the National Marrow Donor Program, which is a registry of HLA-typed donors who have volunteered for transplant donation to obtain additional donors. Those donors will be procured on a separate procurement protocol. 
 
For all third party lines, donors have been evaluated by [CONTACT_871931]. Donors must meet standard 
eligibility criteria for donation of blood or marrow. They have been screened with the standard blood bank donor questionnaire, medical history and testing for infectious disease markers by a physician who is experienced in screening transplant donors. Only 
donors who have cleared this process and were deemed to be eligible provided blood for 
VST generation. For lines that were previously manufactured for H29966, only those where the donor is eligible may be included in the third party bank. 
 
The results of the physician assessment and ID testing were reviewed by a CAGT laboratory director who gave the final eligibility determination according to the SOP for 
Donor Evaluation. 
 
The processes discussed in the protocol and related manufacturing SOPs are in 
compliance with 21CFR1271.   
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1217778] Line selection and availability 
[IP_ADDRESS] VST Lines selection 
We will use multivirus-specific VSTs, generated initially for use on our donor-specific study. The lines were generated using a rapid protocol whereby [CONTACT_871932], 
followed by [CONTACT_871933] G-Rex culture 
device optimized for T cell expansion. Donor-specific VST lines generated according to this protocol were previously found to be safe and effective in a Phase I clinical trial as discussed.   
To initiate the multivirus-specific VSTs 15x10
6 PBMCs were pulsed with a master mix of pepmixes 
spanning Adv (Hexon and Penton), CMV (IE1 and pp65), EBV (LMP2, EBNA1, BZLF1), BK virus

Page 24 of 45 (VP1 and large T) and HHV6 (U90, U11 and U14). After 30mins the cells/pepmix combination 
was transferred directly to the G-Rex culture device. The VST media was supplemented with the cytokines IL7 and IL4 (10ng/ml and 400U/ml, respectively) in order to inhibit apoptosis and 
promote expansion of multivirus-specific T cells.  
 The VST lines were checked for identity, phenotype and sterility, and cryopreserved prior to administration according to our SOP. To test the functional antigen specificity of the VST we will use individual pepmixes spanning each of the viral antigens used in the initial stimulation as a 
stimulus in IFN ELIspot. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_871881]-pools to identify novel immunogenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_871882]. 
 Products that meet study specific release criteria, as detailed on the CofA, will be infused as per 
Section 2.4.2. 
 If a positive sterility testing result is reported after the product is infused, the FDA and other relevant parties will be notified as per our manufacturing SOP B01.03.XX (Product Quality Assurance Program and Release and Return of Clinical GMP/GTP Products) and clinical research SOP J02.06.XX (Serious Adverse Experience and Unanticipated Problem 
Reporting).   Management of such a situation is further described in our SOP F05.09.XX 
(Management of Culture Positive Cell Therapy Products).   [IP_ADDRESS]  No Matched VST Line Available 
If no matched line is available the patient will be registered so that the feasibility of the approach 
can be assessed. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] VST Line Available but Patient Status Changes
 
Patients with a clinical course that changes between screening and infusion and renders patient ineligible at time of infusion will not be given the VST.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria for Selection of VST Line 
In general preference will be assigned to the infusion of a line with confirmed virus-specific activity 
against the infecting virus through a shared HLA allele rather than the overall level of HLA match. For example for a patient with an adenovirus infection a line that matches at 2 loci but that has recognition of adenovirus mediated through those antigens would be preferable to a line matched 
at 3 loci but with no demonstrated activity agains t adenovirus. Patients with a partial response are 
eligible to receive up to 4 additional doses. 
 
2.4.2 Administration and Monitoring 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Partially HLA-matched VSTs will be thawed and given by [CONTACT_439]. Patients 
will receive 2 x 10
7partially HLA-matched VSTs/m2 as a single infusion. In the rare case where 
insufficient banked cell product is available, a lower number of cells may be infused after 
discussion with the principal investigator, patient and/or guardian and the treatment team. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Premedications: Patients without prior history of reaction to blood products generally do     
not require premedication. If patients receive premedication, Benadryl 0.25-0.5mg/kg 
(max 25 mg) IV/po and/or Tylenol 5-10 mg/kg (max 650 mg) po/iv may be given.

[IP_ADDRESS] Patients will be monitored according to institutional standards for administration of blood 
products and at a minimum will be monitored according to below:   
 Patients should remain in the clinic for at least one hour 
 Patients should remain on continuous pulse oximetry for at least 30 minutes 
 Vital signs should be monitored at the end of infusion then at 30 and 60 minutes

function of the infused VST, or 2) does not have a complete response to their initial infusion, did not experience a significant toxicity to their initial infusion, and if alternative treatment options are not available or associated with unacceptably high risk of side 
effects (e.g. count suppression or renal disease), they are eligible to receive up to [ADDRESS_1217779] be decreased to a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day of Prednisone (or equivalent) or lower before the patient may receive additional doses.  
 
Additional doses may be from the same donor or a different donor  based on available cell 
lines and patient/disease factors. Decision to switch to a different donor can be made by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_871883], concerns for immune escape of the targeted virus and/or availability of a better matched or otherwise superior VST line. Additional treatments will only be given 
following the agreement of the patient, treating physician, and investigator.  This process 
can be repeated as needed.

3.1.2 Antiviral Activity 
Peripheral blood and, where relevant, stool and urine will be monitored for CMV, EBV, adenovirus, BK virus, JC virus and/or HHV6 viral load. For the infection under treatment response in viral load 
will be defined as follows:  Complete response: Return to normal range as defined by [CONTACT_871937].  
Partial response:  Decrease in viral load of at least 50% from baseline or 50% improvement of 
clinical signs and symptoms Mixed response : Decrease in viral load of at least 50% from baseline for one infection and an 
increase or no change in viral load for a second infection (only applicable for patients with two or more infections at baseline). Stable disease:  Changes insufficient to qualify as partial response or progression 
Progression:  Increase in viral load of at least 50% from baseline or dissemination to other sites 
of disease.  Viral response data will be reviewed by a consensus committee of investigators.  3.1.3 Reconstitution of Antiviral Immunity 
Patient serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be monitored for virus-specific activity 
by [CONTACT_871938]-restricted epi[INVESTIGATOR_304964], intracellular cytokine staining, serum cytokine profiling and/or other assays as they become available for immune profiling purposes.

Page 30 of 45 3.1.9 Secondary graft failure 
Secondary graft failure is defined as initial neutrophil engraftment followed by [CONTACT_871939] <500/mm3 for three consecutive measurements on different days, unresponsive to 
growth factor therapy that persists for at least [ADDRESS_1217788] eligibility and consent will be obtained per institutional practices before study ther apy is initiated. This protocol will be discussed 
with eligible patients and, when appropriate, their guardians. Only patients who receive their care 
in the integrated Cell and Gene Therapy Transplant program at [LOCATION_007] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871885]. Consent process will consists of two parts: a) screening consent and b) treatment consent 
1. The screening portion consists of registering demographic data and patient eligibility data. 
The search for a suitable matched virus VST line is initiated if the patient is eligible. If a VST line is not available, the following data will be collected: demographic data, HLA type, infection type and follow up data. 
2. If a suitable matched VST line is available, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_871886]. After enrollment in the treatment portion of 
the protocol patient can then receive the identified VST line if eligibility criteria are still met.  
3. Patients will be assessed for eligibility for subsequent infusions by [CONTACT_871940]. If the patient is deemed eligible, the search for a subsequent VST line will be 
initiated. 
 
All cell culture manipulations will be carried out  in the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy GMP 
facility using current standard operating procedures (SOPs). After Quality Assurance testing is 
complete a Certificate of Analysis will be issued.   
 
4.2 Study Monitoring 
4.2.1 Follow-up Schedule The Follow-up Schedule for scheduled study visits is outlined in Table 4.2.2 
 
Follow-up Assessments: The timing of follow-up visits is based on the date of VST infusion. If 
a patient has multiple VST doses the schedule resets again at the beginning so follow up relates to the last VST dose. Additional follow up assessments may be done based on clinical and laboratory responses.

4.3.1  Criteria for Modified Follow-Up 
The following criteria will result in the patient being ineligible for further treatment on the 
protocol, although response data will continue to be collected as applicable: 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Any patient who develops irreversible, life threatening, Grade 3-[ADDRESS_1217793] injection. In such patients, the toxicities will be followed until resolution or until their off study date.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Any patient who receives any other hematopoietic cell product. In such patients, 
adverse event data collection will cease. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Any patient who receives therapy for relapse of their primary malignancy.In such 
patients adverse event data collection will cease. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Any patient who experiences Grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome that 
persists beyond 72 hours. In such patients, the toxicity will be followed until resolution or until their off study date. 
 
Patients who meet “modified follow-up” criteria remain on long-term follow-up as per the required assesments table 4.2.2.  
 4.3.2 Off Study Criteria

[ADDRESS_1217797] that the true response rate is 20% in anti-
viral activity, where a positive response is defined as the viral load reduction to the normal level 
for at least one of the 5 virus types (CMV, EBV, adenovirus, BK virus and HHV6) within [ADDRESS_1217798].    Allowing a 5% type-I error and 90% power, the null hypothesis will be tested against a one-sided alternative that the true response rate is 40%.  The maximum size is [ADDRESS_1217799] patients will finish the follow up and will allow a 10% drop out rate. Therefore, the maximum sample size is 50.  The phase IIa trial operates in two stages, where the first stage recruits [ADDRESS_1217800] stage, if 5 or fewer positive responses are observed, then the study will be stopped.  Otherwise, 21 additional patients will be accrued to reach the goal of 45 accruals.  At the end of the trial, the null hypothesis will be rejected, if 14 or more positive responses are 
observed in among the 45 patients. This design has 65.6% chance to stop early when the true 
response rate is 20%.   After the phase IIa trial suggests excellent clinical responses that warrant further investigation, the study will be expanded to recruit 30 additional patients to evaluate the viral reduction based HLA matching. We hypothesize the viral reduction among the low HLA matching group (1/8, 2/8, 
or 3/8 HLA matching) is not worse than the high HLA matching group (4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8, or 8/8).  
 The sample size is calculated based on non-inferiority trial for comparing two-sample means. Based on the preliminary data, the standard deviation of viral reduction is about 18. We assume that the viral reduction in the low HLA matching group is not inferior to the high HLA matching 
group when the difference in the viral reduction between the two groups is no less than -10 (non-
inferiority margin). Preliminary data suggest that the ratio of sample size between the low and high HLA matching groups is 5 to 7.   A sample size of 30 patients with low HLA matching and 42 with high HLA match (total 72) would have at least 85% power to test the non-inferioirty hypothesis with 2-side 5% alpha level.  Assuming 10% of patients to be lost to follow-up, then the study will recruit up to a total of [ADDRESS_1217801] finished their 42 days follow up. The

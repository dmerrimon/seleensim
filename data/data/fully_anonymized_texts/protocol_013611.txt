  22July 2019 Tool Revision History 
Version Number: 1.1 
Version Date: February 6, 2019  
Summary of Revisions Made: None (Original Version) 
Version Number: 1.2  
Version Date: April 2, 2019 
Summary of Revisions Made: An explanation of the randomization has been added and the 
randomization code will now be held by [CONTACT_91414].  We have added the physical locations of where 
patients will be studied and added locations where blood samples will be analyzed.  We have 
clarified that a ‘per protocol’ analysis will be used and have defined how subjects will be defined 
to be compliant with the protocol.  Finally we have made additional minor edits to the protocol to 
respond to ever other comment from NCCIH. 
Version Number: 1.3  
Version Date: April 24, 2019 
Summary of Revisions Made: update 1. Page 8, “Design and Outcomes”, this statement has 
been added: “ The eight subjects will be selected through voluntary participation. The option will 
be provided to all subjects who sign the consent. Once there have been 4 subjects in Group A 
and 4 subjects in Group B selected, there will no longer by [CONTACT_91415] .” 
Update 2. p33, section 9.3 This section is changed to state: “ All randomized subjects will be 
included in the primary analysis, analyzed based on intention-to-treat. In addition, a secondary 
analysis based on a per protocol will be conducted. Per protocol analysis will exclude patients 
who missed 30% or more of their assigned treatment.  Please refer to section 5.4 for the 
equation to calculate compliance .” 
Version Number: 1.4  
Version Date: May 7, 2019 
Summary of Revisions Made: Section 4.1.  We have combined elements of inclusion criteria into 
fewer statements and we have responded to the reviewer’s comment in the margin.  As 
requested, we have moved visits 1 and 2 from section 6.2.4 to section 6.2.1.  This created some 
redundancy of statements in section 6.2.1. which has been edited in an attempt to remove the 
redundancy.  
Version Number: 1.5  
Version Date: July 22, 2019 
Summary of Revisions Made: In response to Westat SIV the following changes were made.  
Redundancies were removed from section 4.2 that were already accounted for in Section 4.1.  
Sections 4.1 and 4.2 were then copi[INVESTIGATOR_91366] 6.2 for consistent listing of 
inclusion/exclusion. In section 10.3.4 we added a deviation for study subjects consuming less 
than 70% of the study drug.  In sections 6.2.[ADDRESS_100989] responded to the reviewer’s comment in the margin.  As requested, we have moved visits

Study Title  
Ginger’s therapeutic potential in asthma  
Objectives  
The primary endpoints are the improved tolerance to the bronchoconstrictive effect (reduced airway 
hyperresponsiveness) of inhaled methacholine  (methacholine PD 20) or a reduction in exhaled nitric oxide. 
The secondary endpoints are a reduction in markers of asthmatic lung inflammation; specifically serum 
cytokines, eosinophilia, and establishing pharmacokinetic parameters of biologically active components 
of ginger in adult asthmatics. 
 
Design and Outcomes   
A placebo controlled, double blind, randomized clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_91367] 
a 1:[ADDRESS_100998], PH 859, [LOCATION_001], NY [ZIP_CODE]. 
 
Screening/Run-In Period Adults 18 and older, with physician diagnosed mild to severe persistent asthma 
will be screened.  After reviewing and signing informed consent, subjects that fulfill inclusion and 
exclusion criteria will be invited to participate. 
 
Day 0/Visit 1 : Screening Visit: review of medical history, recording of medication use, physical exam by 
[CONTACT_91416], scoring on ACT and basic spi[INVESTIGATOR_91368].   Subjects will 
then be asked to continue their usual asthma medications for the 14-21 day run-in period.  
 
Day 14-21/Visit 2 : Subjects will be asked to withhold appropriate medications (long  acting 
bronchodilator for 36 hours, short acting bronchodilator for 6 hours). Women of child bearing potential 
will have a urine pregnancy test checked. Checklist for methacholine will be reviewed with patient. If 
ACT remains ≤ 19 and FEV1> 60% predicted, subjects will undergo methacholine bronchoprovocation 
testing which involves inhaling increasing concentrations of nebulized methacholine until the measured 
FEV1 decreases by 20% of the initial value measured after diluent inhalation, defined as the methacholine 
PD20. If ACT is > 19, consistent with good asthma control, subjects will be terminated from the study.

Day 15-23 (1-2 days following V2)/Visit 3 Randomization Visit:  
If ACT remains ≤ 19, subjects will be randomized into 2 treatment groups; oral ginger (1g twice per day: 
Pure Encapsulations™) or matching placebo ( FDA IND in place: #126513 ).  Ratio of randomization will 
be 1:1. An independent statistican will generate the randomization codes and allocations. The blinded 
study coordinator will retrieve the randomization allocation for each subject  through RedCap. RedCap is 
an institutionally available automated system for randomization; the independent statistician  will have 
direct oversight over the process. The blinded study team will not have access to the randomization codes.  
 
At the randomization visit, women of child bearing potential will have a negative pregnancy test 
confirmed, subjects will be asked to complete an ACT to assess asthma control and a validated asthma 
quality of life questionnaire (Juniper mini AQLQ). Fractional excretion of nitric oxide (FeNO) will be 
measured using a Circassia Niox Vero machine with disposable filters. Pre-dose basic spi[INVESTIGATOR_91369]. 10ml of blood will be collected for measurement of baseline cytokines, biomarkers and blood 
eosinophil count. Subjects will be given their first dose of study drug and post-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_91370].  
 
A total of eight subjects will undergo pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements of the key metabolites of 
active ginger components. For those patients, an additional 35 ml of blood will be collected over an 
additional 7 times points (pre-dose, 0.5 hour,1 hour,2 hour,3 hour, 4 hour, and 8 hour).  The eight subjects 
will be selected through voluntary participation. The option will be provided to all subjects who sign the 
consent. Once there have been 4 subjects in Group A and 4 subjects in Group B selected, there will no 
longer by [CONTACT_91417].  
 
Day 43-50/Visit 4: . Subjects will be asked to withhold morning dose of the study drug the day of the 
study visit.  Women of child bearing potential will have a negative pregnancy test confirmed. Subjects 
will be asked to complete an ACT to assess asthma control and a validated asthma quality of life 
questionnaire (Juniper mini AQLQ). FeNO will be measured using a Circassia Niox Vero machine with 
disposable filters.  Basic spi[INVESTIGATOR_10239], Methacholine test will be performed if subject 
meets safety criteria (FEV1>1.5L or 60% predicted). 10ml of blood will be collected for measurement of 
cytokines, biomarkers and blood eosinophil count. For those patients in PK group, an additional 35 ml of 
blood will be collected over an additional 7 times points (pre-dose, 0.5 hour,1 hour,2 hour,3 hour, 4 hour, 
and 8 hour).  Study drug will be administered in the clinic after the pre-dose PK blood draw.  
 
Unused study medication will be collected and pi[INVESTIGATOR_91371].  
 
Day 71-78/Visit 5 : Subjects will be asked to withhold morning dose of the study drug the day of the study 
visit.  Women of child bearing potential will have a negative pregnancy test confirmed. Subjects will be 
asked to complete an ACT to assess asthma control and a validated asthma quality of life questionnaire 
(Juniper mini AQLQ). FeNO will be measured using a Circassia Niox Vero machine with disposable 
filters.  Basic spi[INVESTIGATOR_10239]. Methacholine hyperresponsiveness will be measured if 
subject meets safety criteria (FEV1 > 1.5L or  >60% predicted).  10ml of blood will be collected for

Sample Size and Population  
Adults 18 and older, with physician diagnosed mild to severe persistent asthma will be screened.  36 
participants will be randomized equally into two arms (18 per group); [ADDRESS_100999] twice 
a day for 28 days or matching placebo. Our sample size analysis requires 16 participant per group and 
with an anticipated 10% attrition rate, we will enroll 18/group.

1. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
1.1 Primary Objective 
The primary endpoints are a clinically significant improvement in tolerance to inhaled methacholine 
(PD20) or a clinically significant decrease in exhaled nitric oxide.  A clinically significant increase in 
tolerance to inhaled methacholine is defined as a 0.7 increase in the doubling dose for inhaled 
methacholine from the subjects baseline.  A clinically significant decrease in exhaled nitric oxide is 
defined as a 20% decrease in subjects starting at a baseline of >50 ppb or a decrease of 10 ppb for 
subjects starting at a baseline of <[ADDRESS_101000] intake; 
1. increases forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_31737] (FEV1) by 100ml. 
2. decreases blood eosinophilia 
3. decreases asthma-associated cytokines in serum 
b. Establish pharmacokinetic parameters of biologically active components of ginger in adult asthmatics.  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus 
The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control report that 9% of Americans have asthma which 
accounted for 1.[ADDRESS_101001] of $[ADDRESS_101002] hyperresponsiveness.  Current asthma 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_91374]- and long-acting β-agonists to combat bronchoconstriction and inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) to reduce airway inflammation. These medications have important adverse effects, 
are not suitable for some patients, and have poor adherence.[ADDRESS_101003] increasingly turned towards complementary and alternative 
medicines for treating asthma.  
 
Recent studies found that 60% of moderate asthmatics and 70% of severe asthmatics report using 
complementary and alternative (CAM) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_91375]-treat their asthma symptoms.[ADDRESS_101004] been used for the relief of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_91376].5 Of the many types of CAM therapi[INVESTIGATOR_91377], as many as 40% of asthmatics use herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_91375]-treat their asthma symptoms.[ADDRESS_101005] mechanism of action of these agents is unclear but may involve attenuation of the allergic cascade 
through blockade of IgE mediated inflammation, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and/or direct 
effects on acutely relaxing human airway smooth muscle (ASM).  
2.2 Study Rationale 
Recently we demonstrated that purified components of ginger (6-shogaol, 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol ) acutely 
relaxed human airway smooth muscle (ASM) in vitro6 and our newest preliminary data shows that 
specific human metabolites of these components have potent ASM relaxing properties. Additionally, we 
have preliminary data showing that ginger components reduced lung inflammation in a mouse model of 
asthma. We demonstrated that the cellular mechanism by [CONTACT_91418] C (PLC) a pi[INVESTIGATOR_91378].[ADDRESS_101006] Guidelines and Considerations 12 of 38 Version 1.5 
  22July 2019 target two key features of the pathophysiology of asthma; smooth muscle constriction and cytokine 
release. It is not possible to measure PLC activity directly in live human subjects, but it is possible to 
directly measure the functional effect of PLC inhibition; improved tolerance for inhaled methacholine and 
reduced inflammation which will be the key biological signatures measured in this 2 month clinical study 
of oral ginger in asthmatics. We contend that this proposal is highly responsive to the goals of this 
program as it (1) studies a natural product in a disease commonly encountered in primary care practice; 
(2) tests a natural botanical substance widely used as a dietary supplement for which sufficient early stage 
safety and mechanistic data justifies further clinical testing; (3) measures the bioavailability of the natural 
product and its major human metabolites; and (4) demonstrates primary biological signatures in patients. 
  
Ginger is widely used as an over-the-counter oral dietary supplement. The formulation and amount of 
ginger used in this study (2g per day; Pure Encapsulations®) has been chemically characterized by [CONTACT_91419] (2 grams) for [ADDRESS_101007] also 
demonstrated in pre-clinical studies in a mouse model of asthma that this dose reduces asthma-associated 
lung inflammation.  
 
The incidence of side effects in a 28 day trials of 30 individuals were not significantly different in placebo 
versus ginger and no adverse events were greater than the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 1. In a 
second study of 27 individuals, no adverse event greater than NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 1 
was reported (no placebo comparison) and the leading complaints were gastrointestinal symptoms of 
eructation, heartburn or indigestion.[ADDRESS_101008] study of 20 patients consuming the same formulation in 
the same amount for the same duration (2g, Pure Formulations, 28 days) no statistically significant 
increase in adverse events occurred compared to placebo, no toxicities were greater than the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria Grade [ADDRESS_101009] been no studies or reports of increased bleeding risk with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_91379].  
3. STUDY DESIGN 
A placebo controlled, double blind, randomized clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_91367] 
a 1:1 ratio with oral ginger 1 gm twice per day or matching placebo.   
18 subjects will be assigned to each of two arms (ginger vs. placebo).  This is defined by a power analysis 
requiring 16 subjects per arm and a 10% projected attrition rate.  Subjects will be evaluated [ADDRESS_101010] (reduced airway 
hyperresponsiveness) of inhaled methacholine  (methacholine PD 20) or a reduction in exhaled nitric oxide. 
Secondary outcomes will include an improvement in baseline FEV1 of 100ml, a reduction in eosinophilia 
or a reduction in asthma associated serum cytokines.  An additional secondary outcome will be defining 
the pharmacokinetic profile of active components of ginger in adult asthmatics.

Randomization is a process that assigns participants/subjects by [CONTACT_3364] (rather than by [CONTACT_75121]) into 
specific groups, typi[INVESTIGATOR_91380]. An independent statistican will generate 
the randomization codes and allocations. The blinded study coordinator will retrieve the randomization 
allocation through RedCap at the time of the randomization visit.. RedCap is an institutionally available 
automated system for randomization; the independent statistician will have direct oversight over the 
process. The blinded study team will not have access to the randomization codes.  In this module, 
randomization model is defined as Drug A and Drug B in a 1:1 ratio. Drug A and Drug B may refer to 
placebo or active drug, however they are left coded as such to ensure blinding. The module creates a 
template allocation table, which the user uses to structure the randomization table to be imported. The 
module also monitors the overall allocation progress and assignment of randomized subjects to ensure 
equal proportions of active drug and placebo.  Only one site member will be allowed randomization 
privileges, but the site will confirm, and lock the specific data field to ensure that no data is altered after 
randomization. There is no stratification, and there are no variable block sizes. 
 
All evaluations and blood draws will be completed at a single site at a single center, the 
outpatient clinic of The John Edsall-John Wood Asthma Center at the Columbia University 
Medical Center.  Blood eosinophils will be measured by [CONTACT_91420] (CALM) with the Department of Pathology and Cell Biology at Columbia University 
Medical Center.  Plasma cytokines will be measured by [CONTACT_91421], at Columbia University and the metabolite measurements within the PK studies

4.[ADDRESS_101015] (IRB).  
Potential enrollees will be approached either in person, by [CONTACT_91425].  
Documentation of ineligibility and non-participation of eligible candidates will be recorded within a 
screening log .  
 
Potential enrollees will meet with the study Coordinator and local physician co-investigators to review the 
study in a quiet room and will be given as much time as needed to read the consent and ask questions. The 
consents, HIPAA Authorization and all study questionnaires will be available in English and Spanish. If 
they agree to participate,  they will be asked to sign a consent.  A copy of the consent form will be given 
to each participant, and the signed original will be kept in the participant’s research chart.  Only 
participants who are capable of providing their own informed consent will be enrolled. 
 
Randomization is a process that assigns participants/subjects by [CONTACT_3364] (rather than by [CONTACT_75121]) into 
specific groups, typi[INVESTIGATOR_91380]. An independent statistican will generate 
the randomization codes and allocations. The blinded study coordinator will retrieve the randomization 
allocation through RedCap. RedCap is an institutionally available automated system for randomization 
and the statistician will have direct oversight over the process. The blinded study team will not have 
access to the randomization codes.  In this module, randomization model is defined as Drug A and Drug 
B in a 1:[ADDRESS_101016] Guidelines and Considerations 17 of 38 Version 1.5 
  22July 2019 member will be allowed randomization priviledges, but the site will confirm, and lock the specific data 
field to ensure that no data is altered after randomization. There is no stratification, and there are no 
variable block sizes. 
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
A 28-day supply of study drug (ginger capsules) or placebo (matching capsules) will be dispensed from 
the Columbia University Medical Center research pharmacy in a blinded fashion and distributed to the 
study subjects by [CONTACT_91426].  Patients will take their first dose 
of study drug at the study site during the randomization visit and will then be instructed to take 1g twice a 
day with meals in the outpatient setting.  Patients participating in the pharmacokinetic studies will be told 
to hold their daily dose on subsequent clinic visit dates until timed dosing occurs in the clinic.  
Potential Adverse Events ; Ginger is widely used as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. The 
formulation and amount of ginger used in this study (2g per day; Pure Encapsulations®) has been 
chemically characterized by [CONTACT_91427] (2 grams) for 
28 days in multiple human studies measuring inflammatory mediators in colonic mucosal biopsies. The 
incidence of side effects in a 28 day trials of 30 individuals were not significantly different in placebo 
versus ginger and no adverse events were greater than the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 1. In a 
second study of 27 individuals no adverse event greater than NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 1 was 
reported (no placebo comparison) and the leading complaints were gastrointestinal symptoms of 
eructation, heartburn or indigestion.[ADDRESS_101017] study of 20 patients consuming the same formulation in 
the same amount for the same duration (2g, Pure Formulations, 28 days) no statistically significant 
increase in adverse events occurred compared to placebo, no toxicities were greater than the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria Grade [ADDRESS_101018] been no studies or reports of increased bleeding risk with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_91379].  
 
Available Supportive Care: A bronchodilator (albuterol/salbuterol) will be available to be administered if the participant is uncomfortable from the effects of the methacholine challenge test. A physician or nurse 
practitioner will be available during all methacholine tests. 
 
There is no dose escalation component to this study . 
No modification to the study interventions will be employed without prior review and approval of the 
NCCIH, FDA, IRB and DSMB.  The leading expected complaints associated with oral ginger 
consumption are gastrointestinal symptoms of eructation, heartburn or indigestion.  We will utilize the 
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical 
descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline:  
 
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental ADL.  
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self care ADL.  
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 18 of 38 Version 1.5 
  22July 2019 Grade 5 Death related to AE. 
FDA IND approves the administration of this dietary supplement from Pure Encapsulations at a dose of 
2g/day for a duration of 56 days.  No changes in these parameters are anticipated.  
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  
The study drug (~500mg capsules) (ginger extract from Pure Encapsulations) and matching placebo have 
been provided to our research pharmacy and packaged (120 capsules/bottle) by [CONTACT_3455].  Each 
bottle is  labeled ‘A’ or ‘B’ and the code is held by [CONTACT_56636].  Study drug is stored at room 
temperature; temperature logs are maintained by [CONTACT_91428].  For distribution to study subjects, 
the clinical research coordinator will obtain the appropriately labeled bottle from the research pharmacy 
on the day of the study visit and distribute to the subject.  Unused study drugs and placebo will be 
destroyed.    
Study intervention accountability records will be the case report source documents that will be stored 
within the study binder and include (1) inclusion/exclusion documentation; (2) medical history; (3) 
concomitant medications; (4) adverse events; (5) methacholine challenge data; (6) individual source 
documents for visits 1-5. 
 
There are no lifestyle/behavioral interventions in this study.  Not applicable.  
The placebo is in an identically appearing capsule as the study compound. Taste of placebo and ginger is 
matched as per manufacturer.  
5.3 Concomitant Interventions  
Required medications: Inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting beta agonists. 
Allowed medications: Long acting anti-muscarinics, montelukast, or other medications not specifically 
excluded. 
Prohibited medications: anti-coagulants such as warfarin, rivaroxaban and similar agents 
5.3.1 Allowed Interventions 
Subjects will continue their usual asthma medications during the study except for the washout periods 
listed in section 4.1.  Patients will continue their inhaled corticosteroids with or without inhaled long 
acting beta agonists and/or long acting anti-muscarinic medications.  Additional asthma medications (e.g. 
montelukast) are also allowed.  Rescue of asthma symptoms with short-acting beta agonists is also 
allowed and if this occurs within a washout period, the study visit will be re-scheduled.  Subjects who are 
not excluded due to the use of anti-coagulants will continue the use of all other prescribed medications. 
5.3.2 Required Interventions 
No other required interventions. 
5.3.3 Prohibited Interventions 
Subjects prescribed anti-coagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban and similar agents) are excluded from 
participating in the study and are prohibited while the participant is in the study.

  22July 2019 Methacholine Provocation:  A methacholine challenge test is a medical test used to assist in the diagnosis 
of asthma. The patient breathes in nebulized methacholine at gradually increasing doubling doses, starting 
with diluent only.  Methacholine provokes bronchoconstriction, or narrowing of the airways via M3 
receptors. The degree of narrowing can then be quantified by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_91390]. Once the FEV1 drops by 20% or more from baseline diluent spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], the test 
in halted.  
 
Methacholine Recovery Challenge  Albuterol will be administered by [CONTACT_12699] (4 puffs) at the end of 
the methacholine provocation test to return the patients FEV1 back to baseline :  
 
GI side effect checklist:  Patients will be asked about the frequency and severity of GI symptoms 
including eructation, heartburn, nausea, bloating or indigestion at Visits 3,4 and 5.  
 
Measured Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO):  FeNO is widely used as a global measure of lung 
inflammation.  Exhaled breath will be collected from forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_91391] (Circassia) procedure described in the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 
guidelines. FeNO levels will be measured at Visits 3,4 and 5.   
 
Blood Draw for Cytokines, eosinophilia, biomarkers:  Peripheral venous blood venous blood will be 
collected at Visit 3, [ADDRESS_101025] blood collected for pharmacokinetic studies.  Eosinophils counts will be measured in the 
Center for Advanced Laboratory Medicine (CALM) lab in the Department of Pathology at Columbia 
University located at [ADDRESS_101026] 
168th, Black Building Room 713, [LOCATION_001], NY [ZIP_CODE]. 
 
Enrollment/Randomization: Randomization to either ginger capsules or placebo will be done using an 
randomization algorithm within REDCap in a blinded fashion (group A or B).  
 
Pre-Dose blood draw for PK subjects:  Study drug should be withheld the day of the study visit for the 
PK subgroup.  Study drug will be administered in the clinic after the pre-dose PK blood draw 
Administer Study Drug: At the randomization visit, subjects will receive [ADDRESS_101027] (~500mg) or identical appearing placebo based on their randomization group.  
 
Post-Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (1hr):  On visit 3, Subjects will repeat spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] [ADDRESS_101028] (~500mg capsules) or two capsules of placebo to determine if there is an acute 
bronchodilatory benefit of ginger.   
 
PK blood draws for PK subjects:  Pharmacokinetic (PK) Measurements:  
Subject plasma will be obtained for the measurement of PK measurements at Visit 3, Visit 4, and Visit 5 
from a group of 8 subjects (4 Males & 4 Females). Serum samples will be collected at the following time 
points before and after the oral ingestion of 1g ginger; At Day 1, 28 & 56 : Pre Dosing (time 0), Post 
Dosing 0.5, 1, 2,3, 4,& 8 hrs. We will quantify major metabolites of 6-shogaol (i.e. M2, M6, M9, and 
M11) and major metabolites of 6-gingerol (6-gingerdiols). Samples will be aliquoted and stored in such a 
manner that additional metabolites of these ginger components and additional ginger components (8-
shogoal, 10-shogaol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol) and their metabolites can be evaluated in future studies. 
Samples will be processed, aliquoted and stored in the research laboratory of Charles Emala (Black 
building room 713;[ADDRESS_101029] Guidelines and Considerations 24 of 38 Version 1.5 
  22July 2019 Dispense Drug: Capsules containing ginger extract (~500mg) or placebo will be ingested by [CONTACT_62086] 
a recorded time at the randomization visit to allow for 1hr post-spi[INVESTIGATOR_91392]. Drug will also be dispensed at visit 4.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_38950]: At study visits 4 and 5 pi[INVESTIGATOR_91393].  
 
Concomitant Medications: All current medications will be recorded including dose and last time taken. 
 
Adverse Events:  Definition of adverse event/serious adverse event: An Adverse Event (AE) is any 
unfavorable and unintended symptom, or disease temporally associated with the administration of ginger 
or the clinical testing proposed that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or 
procedure. 
Classification of adverse event severity: We will utilize the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on 
this general guideline:  
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental ADL.  
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self care ADL.  
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 Death related to AE. 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined by [CONTACT_54767]: death, life-threatening AE, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Serious adverse events occurring after signing the informed consent 
and during the follow-up period, including laboratory test abnormalities fulfilling the definition of SAE, 
whether or not considered related to the study medications or procedures, will be recorded on the Serious 
Adverse Event form and forwarded to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_91394].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_91395] (DSM, FDA, NHLBI, Pharmaceutical supplier) according to the 
institutional guidelines. All adverse events will also we reported to the IRB according to the institutional 
AE reporting guidelines.  Every attempt will be made to collect discharge summaries for each 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91396].  
 
Collect Unused Study Drug: Unused drug will be collected and Visits 4 and 5; upon completion of the 
study, unused study drug will be collected and destroyed.

Randomization 
Randomization to initiation of study intervention will occur on the same day.  Randomization will occur 
at visit 3 and will precede an intervention (i.e. starting of oral ginger or placebo). 
Randomization is a process that assigns participants/subjects by [CONTACT_3364] (rather than by [CONTACT_75121]) into 
specific groups, typi[INVESTIGATOR_91380]. An independent statistican will generate 
the randomization codes and allocations. The blinded study coordinator will retrieve the randomization 
allocation through RedCap. RedCap is an institutionally available automated system for randomization

(Atrium Innovations, Pure Encapsulations) and delivered to the research pharmacy at the Columbia 
University Medical Center. We do not anticipate any collected data offering evidence of a participant’s 
assignment to a particular arm.  All study data is collected objectively without an opportunity for the 
collected data to identify the study arm.  For example, changes in methacholine PD20 and exhaled nitric 
oxide (primary outcomes) will vary over the course of the study in both ginger and placebo treated 
subjects.  These variations will not be able to offer evidence of group membership and will only be 
informative after analysis in the aggregate.  
 
The study PIs, Emily DiMango, MD, Charles Emala, MD are authorized to break the blind if there is a 
concern for subject safety, a serious adverse event or safety concerns raised by [CONTACT_4318].  The PIs will 
contact [CONTACT_91434]. The PIs, Research Coordinator, study 
statistician(s), subjects and research pharmacy will be blinded.  The research pharmacy will be notified as 
to randomization to drug A or B but will be unaware of which is ginger versus placebo.

Any subjects who discontinue the study early will be contact[CONTACT_91436].  These 
reasons will be documented in the study binder.  If termination occurs to lack of tolerance or adverse 
events related to the study drug or procedures, protocols for reporting adverse events will be followed as 
outlined below. 
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Bronchodilator:  (albuterol/salbuterol) will be available to be administered if the participant is 
uncomfortable from the effects of the methacholine challenge test, and also be used for reversibility testing 
after spi[INVESTIGATOR_91398] V1. These drugs can lead to tremor, nervousness, tachycardia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_91399] 
– these reactions are transient and rare (<5%) with the proposed doses used for this study, and if they occur, 
we will monitor the patient until they return to baseline.  High doses may cause arrhythmias and 
hypokalemia: these are very unlikely with the doses used for this study. 
 
Exhaled NO (FeNO):  Exhaled breath will be collected from forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_91400] (Circassia) procedure described in the American Thoracic Society 
(ATS) guidelines. There are no known risks involved with breathing into the collection system. 
GI side effects:  Patients will be asked about the frequency and severity of GI symptoms including 
eructation, heartburn, nausea, bloating or indigestion.  
Methacholine challenge:  involves the inhalation of an agonist to induce bronchoconstriction and may 
induce the symptoms of an asthma exacerbation (chest tightness, dyspnea, coughing).  The procedure is 
performed in a closely monitored clinical environment, with availability of bronchodilator.  This procedure 
has been safely used in many previous studies by [CONTACT_27156]; we will only perform this procedure if the 
baseline FEV 1 is > 60% predicted.  
 
Questionnaires and assessments : Participants will be asked to provide information about their 
psychological, physical, and medical functioning on questionnaires.   
  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations [ADDRESS_101034] (ACT). The self-administered validated ACT will be used for this measurement.  
 
Juniper mini -Asthma specific quality of life (mini AQOL) . Disease specific quality of life will be 
measured via the Juniper mini-Asthma Quality of Life questionnaire, a validated questionnaire. 
 
2 week recall questionnaire:  The Asthma two week recall (A2WR) was developed to capture the inherent 
intensity of the disease in individuals with asthma. It quantifies severity by [CONTACT_91431], risk, and the amount of medication required to maintain control.  
 
Pulmonary Function Testing : requires deep and forceful respi[INVESTIGATOR_91401]. It is a commonly performed 
and safe examination that is widely performed in patients with lung disorders. Some patients report chest 
soreness the day following the procedure. Some patients may experience light-headedness during the forced 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. The risk of syncope is mitigated by [CONTACT_91437].  
 
Venous Blood Draw : For each blood draw, approximately 10 ml of venous blood will be drawn by 
[CONTACT_91438]. For patients who consent to the pharmacokinetics study, an 
additional 105 ml of blood will be required. Blood drawing may cause a small amount of pain. In 
addition, a temporary bruise may develop. Rarely, people faint after blood drawing. Very rarely, the vein 
in which the needle has been inserted may become inflamed or infected.  
 
Ginger is widely used as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. The formulation and amount of 
ginger used in this study ( 2g per day ; Pure Encapsulations®) has been chemically characterized by 
[CONTACT_91427] (2 grams) for 28 days in multiple human 
studies measuring inflammatory mediators in colonic mucosal biopsies. The incidence of side effects in a 
28 day trials of 30 individuals were not significantly different in placebo versus ginger and no adverse 
events were greater than the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 1. In a second study of 27 individuals 
no adverse event greater than NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 1 was reported (no placebo 
comparison) and the leading complaints were gastrointestinal symptoms of eructation, heartburn or 
indigestion.[ADDRESS_101035] study of 20 patients consuming the same formulation in the same amount for the 
same duration (2g, Pure Formulations, 28 days) no statistically significant increase in adverse events 
occurred compared to placebo, no toxicities were greater than the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade [ADDRESS_101036] been no studies or reports of increased bleeding risk with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_91379].  
   
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters 
●Methacholine challenge  involves the inhalation of an agonist to induce bronchoconstriction and may induce the symptoms of an asthma exacerbation (chest tightness, dyspnea, coughing).  The procedure is 
performed in a closely monitored clinical environment, with availability of bronchodilator.  This 
procedure has been safely used in many previous studies by [CONTACT_27156]; we will only perform this 
procedure if the baseline FEV 1 is > 60% predicted.  
●Bronchodilator  (albuterol/salbuterol) will be available to be administered if the participant is 
uncomfortable from the effects of the methacholine challenge test. 
●GI side effects will assessed at each study visit.   
●Venous Blood Draw : Rarely, people faint after blood drawing and therefore will be seated during blood 
draws. Very rarely, the vein in which the needle has been inserted may become inflamed or infected. 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 30 of 38 Version 1.5 
  22July 2019  
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Parameters 
●Pulmonary function testing : (spi[INVESTIGATOR_91402]) adverse effects are immediately 
apparent during the test and will be treated (albuterol inhaler) and recorded in the case report forms. 
●GI side effects:7,16  This will be assessed at each study visit to ensure tolerance of the ginger capsules 
and will be recorded in the case report forms.  Evidence of GI intolerance will be addressed as detailed in 
adverse events below. 
●Venous Blood Draw : Rare fainting during blood draws occurs due to a vaso-vagal response and is 
immediately apparent.  Subjects will have their blood pressure and heart rate assessed and will be 
monitored until they return to normal. Very rarely, the vein in which the needle has been inserted may 
become inflamed or infected.  Blood draw sites will be inspected at each clinic visit. 
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the administration of ginger or the clinical testing proposed that may or may not be considered 
related to the medical treatment or procedure.  Adverse events will be recorded regardless of their 
relationship to the study intervention.  
Defining: A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred) 
 Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect   
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91403], based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. 
 
Adverse Event solicited and unsolicited: 
Solicited at each study visit: 
 ●Gastrointestinal side effects (including eructation, heartburn, nausea, bloating or indigestion) 
 ●Venipuncture complications (swelling, infection) 
Unsolicited at each study visit: 
●Patients will have a general medical examination and vital signs at every visit.  
 
7.4 Reporting Procedures 
Reporting: SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly related to the study intervention will be 
reported to the Independent Monitors(s), IRB, FDA, and NCCIH in accordance with requirements.   To 
satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported using the following 
timeline:   
 Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB within 48 
hours and to the Independent Safety Monitor(s) and to the NCCIH within 7 days of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event.  
 Any other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB, Independent Safety Monitor(s), and 
NCCIH within 14 days of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
All unanticipated problems should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_8706]’s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and OHRP within 
one month of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator. 
Reporting to the FDA for the IND:  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 31 of 38 Version 1.5 
  22July 2019  7-day IND Safety Report (unexpected fatal or life-threatening AEs related to the intervention); a 
copy of the report sent to the FDA will be submitted to the NCCIH Program Officer and 
Independent Safety Monitor(s) within 24 hours of FDA notification.  
 15-day IND Safety Report (any other serious and unexpected AE related to the intervention); a 
copy of the report submitted to the FDA will be submitted to the NCCIH Program Officer and 
Independent Safety Monitor(s) within 24 hours of FDA notification.  
 All other AEs documented during the course of the trial will be reported to NCCIH on an annual 
basis by [CONTACT_91439].  The Independent Safety Monitor(s) Report 
will state that all AEs have been reviewed. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_101037]. Jeanine D’Armiento, a pulmonologist, and [CONTACT_91453], a physician and epi[INVESTIGATOR_47561], will serve 
as the data and safety monitors for the proposed study.  
 
8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
Adverse gastrointestinal events associated with the consumption of ginger that require medical intervention 
(intravenous fluid administration, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]) will  prompt temporary suspension of enrollment 
and/or study interventions until a complete safety review is convened.  Adverse reactions to inhaled 
methacholine that require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91404]/or study 
interventions until a complete safety review is convened.   Subsequent review of serious, unexpected, and 
related AEs by [CONTACT_4318], Independent Safety Monitor(s), IRB or the FDA may also result in suspension 
of further study interventions/administration of study product. The FDA retain the authority to suspend 
additional enrollment and study interventions/administration of study product for the entire study, as 
applicable. 
Participants will continue to be followed with their permission if study intervention is discontinued.  
Temporary discontinuation of treatment would interrupt the consecutive [ADDRESS_101038] is removed from the study, evaluations related to 
any adverse events would be continued as defined in section 7.5 above. 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues  
We hypothesize that the oral consumption of Pure Encapsulation® ginger extract (2g/day by [CONTACT_91440][INVESTIGATOR_91405], will have an 
improvement in their tolerance to inhaled methacholine or a reduction in lung inflammation over the [ADDRESS_101039] Guidelines and Considerations 32 of 38 Version 1.5 
  22July 2019 the lung that over time results in improved pulmonary function.   
Primary hypotheses: are that the oral daily consumption of ginger will improve the tolerance to inhaled 
methacholine and/or a reduction in exhaled nitric oxide.   
Secondary hypotheses: are that an additional measure of pulmonary function will improve (an increase in baseline FEV1) and/or that secondary measures of inflammation (eosinophilia, asthma associated 
cytokines) will improve. 
Primary outcome measures:  The primary outcome measures are methacholine (PD20) and exhaled nitric 
oxide. These outcomes will be measured at visit 3 (baseline) and visits 4 and 5 (days 28 and 56 of the oral 
ginger or placebo consumption). 
 
Secondary outcome measures: A clinically significant increase in baseline FEV1 of 100ml.  For subjects 
with eosinophilia (>300 cells/ul) a 32% decrease in blood eosinophils17, a 40% decrease in serum IL418,19, 
a 50% decrease in serum IL520 or a 75% decrease in serum IL13.21   
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization 
We utilized published literature to identify the magnitude of change in our primary outcomes that are 
clinically relevant.  As illustrated in the table in section 3, we calculated a need of 14 subjects per arm for 
the methacholine measurement and 16 subjects per arm for the exhaled nitric oxide assessment (same 
subjects studied in methacholine and exhaled nitric oxide assays).  Thus we need 16 subjects per arm and 
anticipate a 10% attrition rate overall requiring 36 subjects.    As illustrated in the table in section 3, an 
enhanced tolerance to inhaled methacholine of 0.7X the doubling dose is considered clinically 
significant.12 We anticipate a S.D. of 0.6 in both groups and aim to achieve 80% power at the 0.05 
significance level.  This requires 14 subjects for each of the two arms.  For exhaled nitric oxide with 
baselines starting at >50ppb, a 20% decrease is considered clinically significant. We expect a S.D. of ~ 37 
and aim to achieve 80% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_101040], allowing the site to randomize the subjects. In this module, randomization model is 
defined as Drug A and Drug B in a 1:[ADDRESS_101041] been pre-packaged and labeled with a code by [CONTACT_91433] 
(Atrium Innovations, Pure Encapsulations) and delivered to the research pharmacy at the Columbia 
University Medical Center. We do not anticipate any collected data offering evidence of a participant’s 
assignment to a particular arm.  All study data is collected objectively without an opportunity for the 
collected data to identify the study arm.  For example, changes in methacholine PD20 and exhaled nitric 
oxide (primary outcomes) will vary over the course of the study in both ginger and placebo treated 
subjects.  These variations will not be able to offer evidence of group membership and will only be 
informative after analysis in the aggregate.  
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations [ADDRESS_101042] arm.  
All randomized subjects will be included in the primary analysis, analyzed based on intention-to-treat. In 
addition, a secondary analysis based on per protocol will be conducted. Per protocol analysis will exclude 
patients who missed 30% or more of their assigned treatment.  Please refer to section 5.[ADDRESS_101043] greatly exceeded these 
enrollment numbers in numerous previous asthma clinical studies in the John Edsall-John Wood Asthma 
Center at Columbia University Medical Center and believe that it is highly unlikely that this study will 
demonstrate poor study performance. 
Adverse gastrointestinal events associated with the consumption of ginger that require medical 
intervention (intravenous fluid administration, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]) will  prompt temporary suspension of 
enrollment and/or study interventions until a complete safety review is convened.  Adverse reactions to 
inhaled methacholine that require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91406]/or study interventions until a complete safety review is convened.   Subsequent review of serious, 
unexpected, and related AEs by [CONTACT_4318], Independent Safety Monitor(s), IRB or the FDA may also 
result in suspension of further study interventions/administration of study product. The FDA retain the 
authority to suspend additional enrollment and study interventions/administration of study product for the 
entire study, as applicable.  
9.[ADDRESS_101044] completed the study at day 56 by [CONTACT_91441] (Shuang Wang, PhD) who will be blinded from the study group until 
the data analysis is completed. 
9.5.1 Primary Outcome   
The primary outcomes are a clinically significant change in tolerance to inhaled methacholine (PD20) or a 
clinically significant change in exhaled nitric oxide. These outcomes will be measured at visit 3 (baseline) 
and visits 4 and 5 (days 28 and 56 of the oral ginger or placebo consumption). 
9.5.2 Secondary Outcomes   
Secondary outcome measures: A clinically significant increase in baseline FEV1 of 100ml.  For subjects 
with eosinophilia (>300 cells/ul) a 32% decrease in blood eosinophils15, a 40% decrease in serum 
IL416,17, a 50% decrease in serum IL518 or a 75% decrease in serum IL13.19   
9.6 Data Analyses  
We will compare the change in log-transformed methacholine reactivity (PD20) in the ginger versus the 
placebo group using two-sample t-test. We will compare patients’ initial PD 20 (day 0) to their subsequent 
PD [ADDRESS_101045] Guidelines and Considerations 34 of 38 Version 1.5 
  22July 2019 day 0 to those at 28 and 56.  An acute benefit in methacholine tolerance will be reflected in a significant 
improvement between PD 20’s at days 0, 28 and 56 while a chronic improvement will be reflected in 
improved PD 20’s at days [ADDRESS_101046] remarkably consistent fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels when 
measured over time with mild-moderate asthmatics having FeNO values of approximately 40 ± 10 ppb.22  
We will consider a 25% change in FeNO  as biologically significant23 comparing each patient’s initial 
FeNO to their subsequent FeNO at days 28, [ADDRESS_101047] 
between subgroups and thus subgroup analysis will not be performed. 
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
Information for each participant will be collected by [CONTACT_91442] (Amanda Kramer) 
and the PIs (Emily DiMango, MD and Charles Emala, MD) and recorded on case report forms (please see 
attachments under appendices, section 15 of this document) that will be electronically recorded within 
REDCap.  All [ADDRESS_101048] completed all institutional and IRB-required training for 
participation in human clinical trials including but not limited to GCP and HIPPA training.  The study 
coordinator has been trained in the administration of spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], methacholine provocation testing, 
administration of bronchodilators and phlebotomy.  All of these procedures will occur in a monitored 
clinical setting (the John Edsall-John Wood Asthma Center at Columbia University Medical Center). 
10.3.2 Quality Control Committee  
The PIs (Drs. DiMango and Emala) and study coordinator (Amanda Kramer) will meet monthly to review 
case report forms and study binders.   
10.3.3 Metrics 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]:  Subjects will be asked to perform pulmonary function testing for collection of lung function data at each visit. Pulmonary function testing will be performed according to American Thoracic Society 
(ATS) guidelines (2005). Subjects will be tested using the same spi[INVESTIGATOR_91388]. Up

will be documented on case report forms.  Some deviations (e.g. failure to abide by [CONTACT_91444]) will 
result in rescheduling of study visits until the washout period is achieved.  Deviations will be review 
monthly during scheduled meetings of Drs. DiMango, Emala and the research coordinator.  Significant 
deviations (e.g. failure to comply with consumption of ginger or placebo capsules, failure to appear for 
study visits within the allowed windows) will result in subject removal from the study.

approved by [CONTACT_91445]. The consent form is separate from the protocol document.  
11.[ADDRESS_101053] will be 
documented in the participant’s record.  
11.3 Participant Confidentiality  
Participant data, which includes identifiable personal health information (PHI), will be collected at 
the clinical site. PHI will be stored in accordance with HIPAA regulations and local university and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91408]. This includes the storage of PHI in locked cabinets or rooms, limited access to secure data areas 
by [CONTACT_91446], password protection for electronic medical records, and explanation of HIPAA 
regulations on the study consent form. Analytic files will not contain personal identifiers (e.g. name, 
address). Reports/manuscripts will be prepared in such a way that individual participants cannot be 
identifiable.  
 Data such as lung function or laboratory tests that are collected as part of this study may be 
transmitted to the participants treating physicians with the consent of the participant. Participants will be 
informed in the consent that PHI may also be disclosed for auditing purposes by [CONTACT_91447].  
 Personal identifiers (e.g. name, address, EMR number) are not transmitted to the Data and Safety 
Monitor or central laboratory in that all biospecimens and records are identified by a study ID, and other 
identifying information such as names are not entered into the central study database. Source records that 
are transmitted to the Data and Safety monitor for data quality audits have identifying information redacted. 
No highly confidential information is routinely collected, although the data collection does include PHI, so 
a breach of confidentiality would constitute a HIPAA violation.  
We will advise participants that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has the right to 
inspect medical records relating to this research for the purposes of verifying data. Where data are shared 
with other research entities, it will comply with the HIPAA definition of a limited dataset, and appropriate 
IRB approvals and waivers will be obtained. 
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], the NCCIH, the OHRP, the FDA, or other 
government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are protected.  
12. COMMITTEES 
The PIs (Emily DiMango,MD and Charles Emala,MD) will be responsible for the overall conduct of the

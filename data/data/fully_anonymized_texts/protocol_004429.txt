Idiopathic HypersomniaIND No.: [ADDRESS_991712] No.:
Not applicable
Study Number: TAK-925-2002 Phase: 1b
Study Design:
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and tolerability of a single intravenous (IV) infusion dose of TAK-925 in subjects with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH). Subjects will be males and females aged 18 through 75 years, inclusive, with IH diagnosed according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3 (ICSD-3) criteria as verified by a previous nocturnal polysomnogram (nPSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) study performed 
within the last 10 years. 
The treatment periods begin on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 (Study Day 1) with Treatment Period [ADDRESS_991713] will be dosed in 2 treatment periods according to the order defined by [CONTACT_726294]/she is randomized. On Day 1 of each treatment period, TAK-925 (or placebo) will be administered as  a single 9-hour IV  infusion commencing at approximately 0800. The infusion will 
be terminated at approximately 1700.
 summary of study drug assignment for each sequence follows:
Sequence N Treatment Period [ADDRESS_991714] 36 subjects will complete the study. To avoid enrollment of short sleepers with chronic sleep deprivation, prospective participants will complete approximately 7 consecutive days of actigraphy supported by a sleep diary beginning on Study Day -9 and ending on Study Day -3 (ie, the day before their Study Day -2 admission to the clinical 
unit), to ensure an average nightly sleep duration of ≥420 minutes (7 hours) during the subject’s normal nocturnal 
sleep period and also, that if the subject’s average nightly sleep duration is ≤480 minutes (8 hours), that the subject 
does not have insufficient sleep syndrome (sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] >2 hours/night more on “off days” than on “work days”). After screening, eligible subjects must discontinue their stimulant medications used for treatment of IH. Medications must be discontinued for a minimum of [ADDRESS_991715] day of dosing (Day 1 of Treatment Period 1). Sodium oxybate must be discontinued at least 4weeks prior to CCICCI

screening.
The screening period is up to 28 days. Following screening, subjects who meet all screening entry criteria will be 
admitted to the clinical  unit on Study Day -2Semi-recumbent vital signs will be obtained following admission; the ESS 
will be recorded in the late afternoon. An overnight 8-hour nocturnal polysomnography (nPSG) will be performed, 
commencing at the subject’s usual bedtime (eg, between 2200 and 2300) to confirm that the subject does not have 
other comorbid sleep disorders or clinically significant nocturnal hypoxemia (O 2saturation ≤80% for ≥5% of total 
sleep time), and to confirm the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is ≤10/hour and the periodic limb movement index 
associated with arousals (PLMAI) is ≤15/hour.
Study Day -[ADDRESS_991717]. Study Days 2 and 4 are washout days. 
 During the study, adverse events (AEs) will be recorded, and clinical labs, vital signs, and ECGs will be 
obtained. Subjects will be discharged from the unit following completion of study exit procedures in the afternoon of Study Day 4 (Day 2 of Treatment Period 2). 
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_726295] 7 days (±2 days) following unit discharge for a safety check 
and all women of childbearing potential will be asked to return to the clinic to complete a urine pregnancy test. If needed, subjects may be seen in the clinic for any safety issues or concerns.

Nicotine dependence that is likely to have an effect on sleep (eg, a subject who routinely awakens at night to 
smoke) or challenge the conduct of this study (smokes ≥10 cigarettes/day) and/or an unwillingness to discontinue 
allsmoking and nicotine use during the confinement portion of the study (Day -2 to Day  4).
Caffeine consumption of more than 600 mg/day  for 7 day s before Study D ay 1 (1 serving of coffee is 
approximately equivalent to 120 mg of caffeine) and/or unwilling to discontinue all caffeine during the 
confinement portion of the study (Day -2 to Day  4).

Statistical Considerations:
Standard summaries of TEAEs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), clinical safety labs, vital signs, and ECGs 
will be performed. Where appropriate, BP and QT parameters will be summarized (N, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) for baseline, post-dose, change from baseline, and change from time-matched baseline to post-dose by 
[CONTACT_3148].
The observed HR and BP will be analyzed using linear mixed effect model for repeated measures in crossover studies. 
The model will include sequence, period, treatment, time points, and treatment by [CONTACT_726297] a random effect for subject. The estimated mean HR and BP for each treatment and the associated standard error and 95% CI will be extracted from the model at each time, along with all pairwise differences from placebo and associated standard errors, 95% CIs, and p-values. The same quantities, averaged over all timepoints during the 
infusion and post the end of the infusion, will also be extracted from the model using appropriate contrasts.
Individual plasma concentrations of TAK-[ADDRESS_991723] and summarized using descriptive statistics, as appropriate.
Sample Size Justification:
Up to 40 subjects are planned to be randomized equally to each treatment sequence to ensure 36 subjects complete the 
study. This number of subjects is typi[INVESTIGATOR_644111] 1 crossover study designs and is considered sufficient for assessment of safety.
In addition, when the true difference between TAK-925 and placebo is minimal, 
the chance to observe the same event is no more than 10%. Non-informative prior distributions  were used in the above 
probability calculation. Allowing for 4 dropouts (10%), 40 subjects are planned to be randomized.CCI

4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 Orexin and Idiopathic Hypersomnia
Orexin (OX) is a neuropeptide and the orexinergic system is a major wake -prom oting system o f 
the brain. Two orexinergic neuropeptides, OX -A and OX -B, have been ident ified to date. These 
neuropepti des exert effects via 2 ty pes of  receptors: orexin ty pe-1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin 
type-2 receptor (OX2R). OX -A has a high affinit y to OX1R and OX2R, and OX -B has a high 
affinit y to OX2R. The [ADDRESS_991729] distribution in the arousal network: 
the locus coerul eus contains only  OX1Rs, the tuberom ammillary  nucleus contains only  OX2Rs, 
and both receptor ty pes occur in the dorsal raphe nucleus and ventral tegmental area. The [ADDRESS_991730] contributions to the regulat ion of arousal. OX2Rs in the 
tuberom ammillary nuc leus are essential for the maintenance of wakefulness, whereas both 
receptor ty pes are requi red for the inhibit ion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [1].
The pathological loss of orexinergic neurons is associated with the developmen t of narcolepsy 
type 1 (NT1) [
2]. Narcol epsy wi th catapl exy, or NT1, has bee n defined by  [CONTACT_426136], Edit ion 3 (ICSD -3) cri teria as having l ow levels o f orexin in 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (<110 pg/mL; <30% of normal levels), coming fro m the nearly  com plete l oss 
of orexin producing neurons [3].
Idiopathic hyperso mnia (IH), defined by [CONTACT_726298] -3, is a chroni c neuro logical disorder that resul ts in 
excessive dayt ime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_726279], 
unrefreshing sleep, difficult y in awakening, cognit ive dysfunct ion, and autonomic symptoms [4].
The eti ology of the condi tion is unknown. Orexin levels in pat ients with IH are wi thin norm al 
limits. IH is thought to be a relat ively rare disease with the prevalence rate of 0.02% to 0.010% [
5].
However, the lack of clear dist inguishing symptoms, the unknown mechanism o f disease, and lack 
of a diagnosti c biomarker resul t in di fficul ties in discriminat ing IH fro m other ty pes of  
hyperso mnia, and thus the prevalence remains unclearly established.
Very  few clinical studi es have been conducted for the treatment of IH. A double -blind 
placebo -controlled crossover study  with a treatm ent peri od of  3 weeks each wit h 200 mg o f 
modafinil vs placebo in 33 drug -free adult IH patients without long sleep according to ICSD -
2 
criteria found that m odafinil significantly decreased the Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS) by  
4.5points. Change in sleep la tency on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) versus 
placebo was not si gnificant. The clinical glo bal impressio n improved significant ly on modafinil 
from baseline to the last visit on treatment [6]. Medicat ions used for the treatment of IH incl ude 
stimulants such as modafinil, armodafinil methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and pemo line as 
well as in some patients, sodium oxybate, clarithromycin, and flumazenil. Ant idepressants with 
activat ing effects such a bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_726280]. Modafinil is the only drug 
that had a m arket ing authorizat ion in so me European countries for the treatment of patients with 
IH. However, the European Medicines Agency wit hdrew the indicat ion of modafinil for the 
treatm ent of IH because the risk for development of skin or hy persensi tivity react ions and 
neuropsy chiatri c disorders outweighed the evidence for clinically important efficacy . There i s no

TAK-[ADDRESS_991731] treatment for IH. As such, there is a huge unmet medical need for an effective 
treatment of the excessive daytime s leepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (EDS) in this condition.
4.1.[ADDRESS_991732]. TAK-925 has a half-maximal effective 
concentration of 5.5 nM in OX2R– Chinese  hamster ovary (CHO) cells, versus >30 μM in OX1R–
CHO cells, indicating over 5,000-fold selectivity for OX2R. In vivo pharmacology studies 
demonstrated significant effects of TAK-925 on increasing wakefulness and decreasing 
cataplexy-like events in the OX/ataxin-[ADDRESS_991733]-in-human phase 1 study (TAK-925-1001), was conducted in Japan. This study was 
designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and PD of single, ascending 
doses of TAK-925 when adminis tered via a 9-hour IV i nfusion to healthy adult and healthy elderly 
subjects (aged ≥65 years old) and subjects with NT1. Single doses ranging from [ADDRESS_991734] ed in subjects with NT1, were safe 
and well-tolerated with no severe adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs). All AEs 
except influenza (considered as moderate) were mild in severity. A single event of euphoric mood 
was reported for a subject receiving 44.8 mg TAK-925, the event was considered related to study
drug and resolved the same day. All cardiovascular-related AEs (increased blood pressure [BP], 
pulse rate increased) were considered mild by [CONTACT_093]. The incidence of increased BP was 
increased in a dose-dependent manner starting from 134 mg (2 of 6 healthy adult sub jects [33.3%]) 
and was most evident in the 240-mg group (4 of 6 healthy adult subjects [66.7%]). At the same 
dose of 112 mg, the incidence of increased BP was higher in Cohort 3 healthy elderly subjects (3 
of 6 subjects [50.0%]), compared with Cohort 1 and 2 healthy adult subjects (2 of 6 subjects CCI

[33.3%]). Dose-related increases in BP and pulse after single dosing were observed in healthy 
cohorts. 
.
Following a single IV infusion, mean plasma systemic exposure of TAK-925 increased 
approximately dose proportionally ac ross cohorts. On average, time to reach plateau was 
approximately 3 hours and the plasma terminal elimination t 1/2ranged from approximately 3 to 
5 hours across all doses. TAK-925 exposure was increased by <30% in elderly subjects (aged 65 to 
80 years) possibly due to decreased hepatic clearance. Furthermore, a proof-of-mechanism (POM) 
study in sleep-deprived healthy subjects was conducted in the [LOCATION_002] (TAK-925-1002). 
 All regimens were well-tolerated with no severe or SAEs, and most AEs 
were mild. A single event of euphoric mood was reported for a subject during treatment with 
112 mg TAK-925; the event was considered mild in  intensity, related to study drug, and resolved 
the following day. Changes in DBP appeared to increase with increasing concentration of 
TAK-925 but there were no apparent trends in the change from time-matched baseline in heart rate 
(HR) or SBP when compared to TAK-925 plasma concentration. Lastly, another study, 
TAK-925-1003, is evaluating both NT1 subjects (orexin deficient) as well as narcolepsy type 2 
(NT2) subjects (orexin levels though to be within  normal) with TAK-925 admin istered as  a 9-hour 
IV infusion for 7 days.
For more detailed background on TAK-925 nonclinical and clinical studies, please refer to the 
Investigator's Brochure.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of a single IV infusion 
of TAK-[ADDRESS_991735] EDS associated with primary sleep 
disorders that are not associated with orexin deficiency, including patients with NT2, IH, and EDS 
associated with obstructive sleep  apnea (OSA). Hence in this proposed phase 1b study, adult 
patients diagnosed with IH according to  the ICSD-3 criteria will be evaluated.CCICCICCI

4.3 Benefit/Risk Profile
TAK-[ADDRESS_991737]. Nonclinical pharmacology studies 
demonstrated that TAK-925 had arousal effects in hypersomnolent states both in animals with 
orexin deficiency (mice) and animals without orexi n deficiency (mice, cynomolgus monkeys and 
marmosets). To explore potential effects in humans, the TAK-925-1001 (first-in-human) and 
TAK-925-1002 studies included healthy adult subjects, healthy elderly subjects, narcolepsy 
subjects with orexin deficiency (NT1), and sleep-deprived healthy subjects. In this proposed phase 
1b study, subjects with IH will be evaluated. The results may provide an early indication of 
whether TAK-[ADDRESS_991738] based on published literature [7]. In the completed clinical studies 
of TAK-925, mild treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of increased BP and HR have been 
observed, which resolved after treatment discontinuation. The 112 mg dose level proposed in this 
study was found to be safe and tolerable in these studies in which healthy subjects received single 
IV doses of TAK-925 up to 240 mg (Study TAK-925-1001). In sleep-deprived healthy subjects, 
administration of the 112 mg dose level resulted in some elevation of placebo-adjusted mean DBP 
of approximately 6 to 9 mmHg throughout mu ch of the nocturnal infusion time although not 
reported as TEAEs (Study TAK-925-1002). In this study, BP will be frequently monitored for all 
subjects. As TAK-[ADDRESS_991739] a s hort elimination half-life, discontinuation of 
infusion, if needed, would be e xpected to result in rapid resolution of increased BP. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_726281] (see Section 6.3).CCI

6.0 STUDY DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION
6.1 Study Design
This is a phase 1b, randomized, double-b lind, placebo-c ontrolled, 2-period, 2-tr eatment crossover 
study to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerab ility of a single IV infusion dose of TAK-925 in 
subjects with IH. Subjects will be males and females aged 18 through 75 years, inclusive, with IH 
diagnosed according to the ICSD-3 criteria (Appendix F)  as verified by a previous nocturnal 
polysomnography (nPSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) study performed within the last 
10 years. 
The treatment periods begin on Da y 1 of Treatment Period 1 (Study Day 1) with Treatment 
Period [ADDRESS_991742] will be dosed in 2 treatment periods according to the order defined by [CONTACT_726299]/she is randomized. On Day 1 of each treatment period, TAK-925 (or placebo) 
will be administered as a single 9-hour IV infusion commencing at approximately 0800. The 
infusion will be ter minated at approximately 1700.
. 
A summary of the treatment assignmen t and sequence is presented in Table 6.a.  The Schedule of 
Study Procedures is included in Appendix A and Treatment Day [ADDRESS_991743] an ESS score of ≥11 will complete medical 
histories and physical examinations, semi-recumbent vital signs assessment, a 12-lead ECG, Beck 
Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Columbia Sui cide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and clinical 
safety laboratory tests. Subjects with an ESS sc ore of <[ADDRESS_991744] 36 subjects will complete the study. To avoid 
enrollment of short sleepers with chronic sleep deprivation, prospective participants will complete 
approximately 7 consecutive days of actigraphy supported by a sleep diary beginning on Study 
Day -9 and ending on Study Day -3 (ie, the da y before their Study Day -2 admission to the clinical 
unit), to ensure an average nightly sleep duration of ≥420 minutes (7 hours) during the subject’s 
normal nocturnal sleep peri od, and, if the subject’s average nightly sleep duration is ≤480 minutes CCI

(8 hours), that the subject does not have insufficien t sleep syndrome (sleepi [INVESTIGATOR_007] >2 hours/night more 
on “off days” than on “work days”). During screening, eligible subjects must discontinue their 
stimulant medications used for treatment of IH. Medications must be discontinued for a minimum 
of [ADDRESS_991745] day of
dosing (Day 1 of Treatment Period 1). Sodium  oxybate must be discontinued at least 4weeks
before screening. 
The screening period is up to 28 days. Following screening, subjects who meet all screening entry 
criteria will be admitted to the clinical unit (St udy Day -2). Semi-recumben t vital signs will be 
obtained following admission, and the ESS will be recorded in the late afternoon. An overnight 
8-hour nPSG will be performed commencing at approximately the subject’s normal bedtime (eg, 
between 2200 and 2300) to confirm that the subject does not have other comorbid sleep disorders 
or clinically significant nocturnal hypoxemia (O 2saturation ≤80% for≥5% of total sleep time), 
and to confirm the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) is ≤10/hour and the periodic limb movement 
index associated with arousals (PLMAI) is ≤15/hour.
Safety assessments including BP, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_11943], and ECG will be collected per the Schedule of Study Procedures (Appendix A) .
On Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 (Study Day 1), all eligible subjects will be randomized and 
receive the first dose of study drug. TAK-[ADDRESS_991746] bo will be administered as a single 9-hour IV 
infusion commencing at approximately 08:00.
tudy Days 2 and 4 are washout days.
 Safety assessments 
including AEs, vital signs, and ECGs will be r ecorded. During the study, AEs will be recorded, 
and clinical labs, vital signs, and safety ECGs will be obtained. Subjects will be discharged from 
the unit following completion of study exit procedures in the afternoon of Study Day 4 (Day 2 of
Treatment Period 2). 
Subjects will return to the study site or be co ntacted by [CONTACT_85790] 7 days (±2 days) 
following unit discharge for a safety check and all women of childbearing potential must return to 
the study site to complete a urine pregnancy test at the end-of-study visit.

9.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments
9.2.1 Physical Examination Procedure
A full physical examinat ion will be performed at the times specified in the Schedule of Study  
Procedures ( Appendix A) and will consist of the following body  systems: (1) ey es; (2) ears, nose, 
throat; (3) cardiovascular system; (4) respi [INVESTIGATOR_36517]; (5) gastrointestinal system; 
(6)dermatologic system; (7) extremit ies; (8) musculoskeletal system; (9) nervous system; 
(10) lymph nodes; and (11) other.
All postbaseline physical examinat ions should assess clinically signifi cant changes fro m the 
baseline assessment.

BMI equals a subject’s weight in kilograms divided by [CONTACT_55739] (BMI =kg/m2). 
BMI will be rounded to the nearest whole number according to the standard convent ion of 0.[ADDRESS_991785] updated versio n of the Beck Depressio n Inventory  (1996, BDI -II).
The test is composed of [ADDRESS_991786] e with depressio n. Each answer is scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores 
indicate m ore severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs used are:
0–13: minimal depressio n.

20–28: m oderate depressi on.
29–63: severe depressio n.
The BDI -II is posit ively correlated with the Hamilt on Depression Rat ing Scale with a Pearson r of 
0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown to have a high one -week test -retest 
reliabilit y (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly  sensit ive to daily variat ions in mood 
[

9.2.4 C
-SSRS
Suicidal  ideati on will  be assessed using the C -SSRS at the times stipulated in the Schedule of 
Study  Procedures (see Appendix A). Two versi ons of  the C -SSRS will be used in this study : the 
screening/baseline C -SSRS lifet ime and the since -last-visit C -SSRS. Any  suicidal  ideation or 
suicidal behavi or during study periods detected by  C-SSRS will be recorded as AEs. The 
investigator will ensure that any  suicidal  ideation or behavior is medically addressed, including 
assessment and treatment by  [CONTACT_3784] m edical  personnel .
9.2.5 Study Drug Administration
On Day 1 of each t reatment period, study drug (TAK -925 112 mg o r placebo) will be administered 
as described in Sect ion 6.1.
9.2.6 Vital Sign Procedure
Vital signs will  include SBP and DBP, HR, body  temperature, and respi [INVESTIGATOR_2842]. The sam e 
method (eg, same size cuff, manual or automated) must be used for all measurements for each 
individual subject and should be the same for all subjects.
Body  temperature will be measured with an oral  (tem perature taken at floor of the mouth) or 
tympanic thermo meter. O 2saturation index will be measured at screening (finger monitor).
Subjects should rest in a bed with the head o f the bed at [ADDRESS_991787] 5 minutes before 
vital signs are measured. Vital signs will include HR, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], SBP, and DBP. The same 
method (eg, same size cuff, manual or automated) must be used for all measurements for each 
individual subject and should be the same for all subjects.
Subjects should c ontinue to rest in a bed with the head of the bed at [ADDRESS_991788]’s ECG trace: HR, RR interval, PR interval, QT

Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168].
PTEs/AEs caused by a study  procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) o r symptom(s) should be recorded

If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condi tions and shoul d NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, laboratory tests, ECG, etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related to 
study  procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such a 
concurrent medical condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately 
as a PTE (worsening or complication occurs before start of study drug) or an AE (worsening or 
complicat ion occurs after start of study  drug). Investigators shou ld ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).

occurrence of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the condit ion beco mes more 
frequent, serious, or severe in nature. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion from baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthri tis), worsening of the condition should only  be recorded as a PTE/AE if occurring to a 
greater extent to that which would be expected. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the cond ition (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after the start of study  drug, 
the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Invest igators should ensure that 
the AE term re corded captures the change in the PTE (eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
drug, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should 
ensure that the AE term  recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Changes in intensit y of AEs/serious PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in intensit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum intensit y record ed.
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or intervent ions):
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of

Insuff icient clinical response (lack of efficacy):
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion should NOT be recorded as an

Collect ion of PTEs w ill co mmence from the time the subject signs the informed consent to 
participate in the study  and cont inue until the subject is first administered study drug (Study 
Day 1) or until screen failure. For subjects who discontinue prior to study  drug administra tion, 
PTEs are collected until the subject discontinues study  parti cipat ion.
Collect ion of AEs will co mmence fro m the time that the subject is first administered study  drug 
(Study  Day 1). Routine co llection o f AEs will continue unt il the fo llow-up/early te rminat ion visit .
[IP_ADDRESS] PTE and AE Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator will assess whether any  subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects m ay report AEs occurri ngat any  other time during the study . Subjects experi encing a 
serious PTE m ust be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the change. 
Non-serious PTEs, rel ated or unrel ated to the study  procedure, need not to be followed- up for the 
purposes of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study  drug or 
not, m ust be m onitored until  the symp toms subside and any clinically  relevant changes in

baseline to post-dose by [CONTACT_3148].
The observed HR and BP will be analyzed using linear mixed effect model for repeated measures 
in crossover studies. The model will include sequence, period, treatment, time points, and 
treatment by [CONTACT_726297] a random effect for subject within 
sequence. The estimated mean HR and BP for each treatment and the associated standard error and 
95% CI will be extracted from the model at each time, along with all pairwise differences from 
placebo and associated standard errors, 95% CIs, and p-values. The same quantities, averaged over 
all timepoints duri ng the infusion and post the end of the infusion, will also be extracted from the 
model using appropriate contrasts.

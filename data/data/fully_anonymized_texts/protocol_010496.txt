Abstract  
For most of the patients in the [LOCATION_002] with end stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney transplantation 
represents the optimal treatment.  Moreover, living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) offers numerous 
advantages over deceased donor kidney transpla nt such as better kidney quality, increased short - and 
longterm graft survival, lower rates of acute rejection, and reduced health care cost.  Nevertheless, there are 
pervasive racial disparities in access to LDKT, with white ESRD patients four times more likely to receive a 
LDKT than African American ESRD patients.  The long -term objective of this program of research is to 
understand the combined effect of a systems -level intervention that enhances communication between dialysis 
facility and transplant cen ter clinicians ( Transplant Referral EXchange or T -REX) and a culturally -sensitive 
individual -level educational intervention (web -based Living ACTS:  About Choices in Transplantation and 
Sharing) on racial disparities in access to LDKT.  The specific aims o f the study are: (a) To develop and refine a 
web-based version of Living ACTS; (b) To conduct an outcome evaluation of the newly created web -based 
Living ACTS intervention by [CONTACT_14652] a potential livi ng 
donor among patients who receive Living ACTS compared to those who receive a control website with an 
embedded educational video; and (c) To conduct a process evaluation of the newly created web -based Living 
ACTS intervention by [CONTACT_14653] (context, reach, dose received, 
fidelity, and recruitment) for an online environment.   
We will conduct a randomized controlled trial among a sample of [ADDRESS_14022] patients in the 
southeastern [LOCATION_002] (ESRD Network 6 in Georgia and South Carolina), the region of the country with 
the largest proportion of African American E SRD patients on the waiting list.  Patients will be randomly 
Version Date: 9/16/20  assigned to one of two study conditions (intervention or control). Participants at all four collaborating transplant 
centers will be seen by [CONTACT_14654] T -REX, thus allowing us to test the independent effect of 
individual -level education on a sys tems -level intervention.  The primary outcome is the percent of patients with 
at least one living donor inquiry.  Secondary outcomes will test the effect of the intervention on key constructs 
of the Information -Motivation -Behavioral Skills model to determi ne possible mediating pathways.  Participants 
will undergo baseline assessment, access either the intervention or control educational materials, and 
complete an immediate follow -up assessment.  Living donor inquiries will be examined over the subsequent [ADDRESS_14023].   
Our specific aims are to:  
● Aim 1: To develop and refine a web -based version of Living ACTS. We will adapt our existing 
intervention for an online environment.  A series of individual interviews with 10 participants will be 
conducted to obtain feedback on the web -based version of Living ACTS. Participant feedback will be 
used to refine and finalize the web -based intervention  
.  
● Aim 2: To conduct an outcome evaluation of the newly created web -based Living ACTS 
intervention by [CONTACT_14652] a potential 
living donor among patients who receive Living ACTS to those who receive a contr ol website 
with an embedded educational video.  Patients who start the transplant evaluation at four transplant 
centers will be assigned to intervention (systems + individual intervention) or control (systems 
intervention alone).  
H1: A greater proportion of participants who receive a culturally -sensitive website with embedded 
video (Living ACTS) will have at least one living donor inquiry over the subsequent [ADDRESS_14024] education.  
H2: Patients in the intervention (vs. control) group will have a significantly greater increase in 
knowledge, motivation, and self -efficacy for the behavioral skills to initiate a conversation about 
LDKT with family or friends from baseline to immediate foll ow-up 
● Aim 3: To conduct a process evaluation of the newly created web -based Living ACTS 
intervention by [CONTACT_14655] (context, reach, dose 
received, fidelity, and recruitment) for an online environment.  We will collect data from participants, 
transplant center records, study records, “Record it!” application data and Google Analytics to inform 
process evaluation findings.   
Version Date: 9/16/[ADDRESS_14025] patients at four major Southeastern US 
transplant centers.  
For the majority of the ~700,000 patients in the [LOCATION_002] (US) with end stage renal disease (ESRD),1 
kidney transplantation (KT) represents the optimal treatment, providing longer survival, better quality of life, 
lower hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285], and substantial cost savings compared to dialysis.1,2 Moreover, of the two types of 
KT, living donor KT (LDKT) and deceased donor KT (DDKT), LDKT is considered the therapy of choice.  LDKT 
offers numerous advantages over DDKT such as better kidney quality;2 increa sed short - and long -term graft 
survival;3,4 lower rates of acute rejection;[ADDRESS_14026], particularly in the case of pre -emptive 
transplantation,2 and potentially shorter wait times to transplantation for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_14627], 
there are pervasive racial disparities in access to KT in general and LDKT, more specifically: white ESRD 
patients are four times more likely to receive a LDKT t han African American (AA) ESRD patients.[ADDRESS_14027] patients in the southeastern 
US (ESRD Network 6 in Georgia and South Carolina), the region of the country with the largest number of AA 
patients on the kidney waiting list, to determine whether a systems -level intervention + individual education is 
effective at increasing the number of living donor inquiries among AA patients at four transplant centers. Our 
team recently built a systems -level interven tion that utilizes an electronic transplant referral exchange (T -REX) 
system to deliver education to patients, enhance communication between transplant centers and dialysis 
facilities, and reduce disparities in KT access (Grant#U01MD010611). Further, from 2010 to 2013 we were 
funded by [CONTACT_14656] (HRSA) to develop and test a culturally -sensitive 
LDKT education intervention for AAs (Living ACTS: About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing , which is 
comprised of a DVD and booklet) that draws from the Information -Motivation -Behavioral Skills Model8 of 
individual level behavior change. While Living ACTS increased LDKT knowledge among AA patients in a prior 
randomized controlled trial (RCT)9, a DVD has diminishing utility. A web -based platform would offer greater 
versatility in light of demonstrated efficacy.[ADDRESS_14028] in LDKT, and therefore more LDKT inquiries by [CONTACT_4676] s’ family or 
friends.  
A. Significance  
A1. There are long -standing and profound racial disparities in access to LDKT. The Southeastern US 
has the lowest rates of, and among the worst racial disparities in KT in the nation.  African Americans 
comprise 32% of the ESRD population1,[ADDRESS_14029], but AAs are 
24% less likely to receive a KT compared to whites.11 The relative odds of receiving an LDKT are eve n lower.12   
Version Date: 9/16/[ADDRESS_14030] at each step in the transplantation process and can be 
attributed to patient, provider, and health system level barriers ( Figure 1 ). 
For example, compared to whites, minorities are less likely to be educated 
about transplantation within a dialysis facility,[ADDRESS_14031] in receiving a 
transplant (step 1),13 receive a referral from a dialysis facility to a transplant 
center for transplant evaluation (step 2),14 start (step 3)15 and complete (step 
4) the required medical evaluation at the transplant center, attain placement 
on the national deceased donor waiting list (i.e., waitlisting) (step 5),16 and 
receive a LDKT or DDKT (step 6).13,15,[ADDRESS_14032] the relative benefits of LDKT vs. 
DDKT because patients are chiefly responsible for finding their  own living 
donor, such as a friend or family member. While reducing disparities in 
access to  both donor types is important, the reasons for disparities in 
different donor types are different. Once patients are waitlisted, the pool of 
deceased donor organs is relatively fixed, and there is less of a role for a 
patient or a patient’s family to impr ove access once waitlisted. But efforts to 
improve access to LDKT can allow patients to by[CONTACT_14657] a 
DDKT and result in faster receipt of a transplant for patients. The proposed  
project directly addresses this extremely important problem in t he field, which  is AA ESRD patients’ reduced 
access to LDKT . 
In order to decrease the known disparities in access to KT, our research focuses on multi -level interventions to 
educate AA ESRD patients on the benefits of LDKT compared to DDKT.  Presently, while there are several 
educational tools and decision aids to h elp patients learn about LDKT, few are culturally -sensitive and 
theoretically -driven.[ADDRESS_14033] patients are multifactorial and multi -level, and include patient -, 
provider -, and health -system factors . Patient barriers include lack of LDKT knowledge and awareness,29-32 
financial concerns, 33-37 and religious beliefs that the body needs to remain whole to enter heaven.38-40  Another 
barrier to living donation is AAs’ distrust of the health care system in general and the organ allocation system 
specifically, due to historical and current abuses.41,[ADDRESS_14034] diminished these concerns.46,47 Aside from patient 
barriers, provider and health system level barriers are equally relevant. For example, research has shown that 
providers are less likely to discuss transplant as an option with patients and are less likely to refer AAs than 
whites.48 Health care provider’s attitudes  and perceptions of the appropriateness of LDKT for their patients 
may lead to lower LD KT rates and incomplete transplant evaluations.49-[ADDRESS_14035] providers’ attitudes about 
their patients’ suitability for transplant.[ADDRESS_14036] in transplant (step 1), and referral for transplantation (step 2), staff are also 

Version Date: 9/16/20  essential in later transplant steps, via active partnering with transplant centers to help patients show up at the 
transplant center to start the medical evaluation (step 3), scheduling of medical tests and procedures required 
for evaluation completion (st ep 4), and maintaining patient health to ensure waitlisting (step 5) ( Figure 1 ).53  
In an effort to reduce barriers, a recent national consensus conference on LDKT recommended collaborations 
between transplant centers, community organizations, dialysis facilities, and others.26  Technology was 
recommended as an educational tool for patients and their support systems,26 which has also been shown to 
be an effective tool in several other web -based kidney disease interventions.54-57  Our proposed study follows 
these recommendations; it builds on our existing work whereby [CONTACT_14658] a model ele ctronic referral and 
communication system (T -REX) to enhance communication regarding patient LDKT education between 
dialysis facilities and transplant centers and allow for appropriate tracking of who receives KT education. This 
electronic referral system is expected to aid in improving clinical practice and transplant health services.  
A3. There is a need for multilevel interventions that address both the health system and patient 
barriers to LDKT among AA ESRD patients. There is a strong scientific premise for this project . It rests on a 
large body of literature that demonstrates clear and compelling racial disparities in access to LDKT and builds 
on our previous research.  We have nearly a 15 -year history of federally -funded work on implementing 
systemlevel interventions t o reduce racial disparities in transplant and individual -level ed ucation that seeks to 
increase the donor pool and promote LDKT among AAs.  For example, two of our funded studies 
(5R01DK062617 -05 and 5R01DK079713 -10, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_14628], Projects ACTS I and II), have focused on increasing 
AA knowledge of transplantation and their intent to become donors via designating their wishes on their 
driver’s l icense, signing donor cards, talking with their families, and registering for the state donor registry.58,[ADDRESS_14037] than at baseline (p=.01).[ADDRESS_14038] study, Living ACTS 
(R39OT20066 -03, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_14628]), developed a DVD -based intervention to increase the understanding of AA 
patients who are waiting for a transplant of their option to seek a living donor and the process, risks, and 
benefits of LDKT. Results indicated intervention participants had significantly higher knowledge immediately 
after reviewing the intervention materials t han control participants, ( β=.10, p=.03). These data support the 
effectiveness of the intervention in changing key psychosocial outcomes.60  
Our work has also highlighted the importance of multi -level and multicomponent interventions. In our recent 
Reducing Disparities in Access to kid Ney Transplantation (RaDIANT) Community Study (R24MD008077, PI: 
[INVESTIGATOR_14629], co -I: Arriola), our community/academic partnership – the Southeastern Kidney Transplant (SEKT) 
Coalition – developed and randomized a dialysis facility -based (n=134) multicomponent interven tion to target 
facility leadership, staff, and patients to improve transplant referral among AA ESRD patie nts in GA,53 which 
successfully reduced racial disparities in transplant referral among 134 low -referral/high -disparity, majority AA 
dialysis facilities in GA, and showed evidence of reducing racial disparities  in access to waitlisting (step 
5).53,[ADDRESS_14039], we will expand  
interventions that were effective in increasing LDKT knowledge among AAs by [CONTACT_14659] a web -based version of  
Living ACTS: About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing. Also, in our  current NIMHD -funded RaDIANT 
Regional Study (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_14629], Co -I: Arriola), we have designed and developed a web -based health systems 
intervention (T -REX) as a secure way for dialysis staff to refer patients to transplant centers for evaluation and 
better tra ck their patients throughout the KT process. Our work on the RaDIANT Regional Study will provide a 
strong foundation for the electronic transplant referral system we propose to utilize  in this study.  If the aims of 
this project are achieved, clinical practice will be improved by [CONTACT_14660] -effective 
approach that uses a web -based education intervention to focus on the well -established barriers that AAs face 
in initiating  conversations with family members about living donation. Wider implementation could potentially 
lead to an increased living donation among AAs thereby [CONTACT_14661].  
B. Innovation  
This study challenges and seeks to shift current practice paradigms by [CONTACT_14662] a novel multi -level intervention 
to improve access to LDKT among AA ESRD patients through a focus on patient education and provider 
Version Date: 9/16/20  communication. The systems -level intervention addresses a major communication gap around the complex 
process of obtaining a transplant between dialysis facilities and transplant centers. In this study, transplant 
centers and dialysis facilities will utiliz e an electronic transplant referral form that includes tracking tools for 
transplant steps that are  not currently monitored  in routine clinical practice by [CONTACT_14663], including 
referral, medical evaluation, waitlisting, and transplantation, as we ll as documenting details of how patients are 
educated about LDKT and DDKT. As dialysis facilities are not mandated by [CONTACT_2692] & 
Medicaid Services to provide patient support for kidney transplantation beyond education, the engagement of 
dialysis facilities to support ESRD patients throughout the transplant process is a novel health systems -level 
paradigm shift in how transplant centers and dialysis facilities work together to improve care coordination for 
ESRD patients and their potential li ving donors. Moreover, the patient -level intervention not only delivers 
culturally -sensitive education about LDKT, but will have features that utilize social media as a vehicle for 
communicating with friends and family about one’s need for a kidney. Taken together, these two separate 
interventions represent a significant improvement over current approaches to improve access to LDKT among 
AA ESRD patients.  
Objectives:  
● Aim 1: To develop and refine a web -based version of Living ACTS. We will adapt our existing 
intervention for an online environment.  A series of individual interviews with 10 participants will be 
conducted to obtain feedback on the web -based version of Living ACTS. Participant feedback will be 
used to refine and finalize the web -based intervention.  
● Aim 2: To conduct an outcome evaluation of the newly created web -based Living ACTS 
intervention by [CONTACT_14652] a potential 
living donor among patients who receive Living ACTS to those who receive a contr ol website 
with an embedded educational video.  Patients who start the transplant evaluation at four transplant 
centers will be assigned to intervention (systems + individual intervention) or control (systems 
intervention alone). We hypothesize that interve ntion patients will have significantly more living donor 
inquiries than control participants over the subsequent [ADDRESS_14040] of the intervention on information, motivation, and self -efficacy for the behavioral skil ls to discuss 
LDKT with others.  
● Aim 3: To conduct a process evaluation of the newly created web -based Living ACTS 
intervention by [CONTACT_14655] (context, reach, dose  
received, fidelity, and recruitment) for an online environment.  We will collect data from participants, 
transplant center records, study records, and Google Analytics to inform process evaluation findings.  
C. Study Designs and Methods  
C.1. Overview  
The study seeks to fulfill the following specific aims by [CONTACT_14664] a scientifically rigorous RCT among [ADDRESS_14041] patients presenting for KT evaluation at a transplant center:  
1. To develop and refine a web -based version of Living ACTS  
2. To conduct an outcome evaluation of the newly created web -based Living ACTS intervention by 
[CONTACT_14652] a potential living donor among patients 
who receive Living ACTS to those who receive a control webs ite with an embedded educational video    
3. To conduct a process evaluation of the newly created web -based Living ACTS intervention by [CONTACT_14665] (reach, recruitment, fidelity, dose delivered, dose 
received, and context) for an online environment  
Version Date: 9/16/[ADDRESS_14042] a series of individual interviews (10 
total) to gain feedback on the website from i ndividuals meeting our participant demographic profile. Participant 
feedback will be used to refine and finalize the intervention website. Next, the multi -center trial will collect data 
from [ADDRESS_14043]. The proposed methods were designed to maximize the robustness of the data while 
minimizing bias in study design, methodology, analysis, interpretation, and reporting. Random assignment to 
conditio n (also for Aim 2) reduces the chances of initial group differences in maturational rates, historical 
events, and regression artifacts.[ADDRESS_14044] ion methods, and instrumentation improve internal validity by 
[CONTACT_14666].62 
Patients will be enrolled into the study through a Zoom video call or telephone call before or after their second 
day of evaluation at which point they will be consented verbally and undergo baseline assessment.  Next, they 
will be randomized to condition,  access either the intervention or control website, and complete an immediate 
follow -up assessment.  Living donor inquiries will be tracked using administrative data from the transplant 
centers for the subsequent 12 months. Aim 3 will be achieved through t he analysis of transplant center data 
(for context and reach), web -site usage statistics (for fidelity), study records (for recruitment), and patient -level 
data (for dose received). We are intentionally not testing the effect of T -REX given its alignment w ith the 
recommendations generated by [CONTACT_14667].[ADDRESS_14045] of the individual -level intervention within a system -level 
intervention to determine its added  value.  
C.2. Preliminary Studies  
C.2.1.  The RaDIANT ( Reducing Disparities In Access to kid Ney Transplantation) 
Regional Study. In our currently funded RaDIANT Regional Study (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_14629], Co -I: Arriola), 
our community/academic partnership – the SEKT Coalition – 
was funded to develop a health systems intervention called T -
REX as part of a multicomponent intervention consisting of 
educational and outreach materials to target multiple levels of 
influence (fac ility leadership,  
staff, and dialysis patients) to reduce disparities in referral for transplant (step 
2) among AA ESRD patients in GA.[ADDRESS_14046] disparities in 
KT, and has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_14630] (with rollout planned to the remaining 7 
transplant centers in GA, NC, and SC by 2017). In the current proposal, we plan to leverage this existing 
software as our health systems intervention.  
C.2.2.  Project ACTS, Living ACTS, and WebACTs. In 2002, we (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_14628]; Co -I: Perryman) 
were funded by [CONTACT_14668] a culturally -sensitive self -
education intervention for AA adults that sought to improve their attitudes and opi[INVESTIGATOR_14631].64  Drawing from our own qualitative formative research29,65 and the 
Resnicow et al. two -dimensional theory of cultural sensitivity,66 our intervention sought to 
address a deep structure dimension of cultural sensitiv ity (i.e., attention to the cultural, social, 
historical, and psychological forces that shape donation -related behavior among AAs) in 

Version Date: 9/16/20  addition to the surface structure dimension (i.e., matching intervention materials and messages 
to observable, “superficial” characteristics of the target population). Two subsequent studies 
were funded, the first to refine the intervention67 and the second to deliver it in community 
settings (ongoing). In light of promising findings  
regarding the efficacy of these interventions, two subsequent 
versions of it 
were created 
that are directly relevant to the current study. First, 
Living ACTS (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_14628]; Co -I: Perryman) was funded by 
[CONTACT_14669] a 
treatment option among AA ESRD patients who have been 
referred to the ETC for evaluation ( Table 1). Results 
demonstrate the ability to increase knowledge of 
the process, risks, and benefits of LDKT as  well as 
willingness to talk to family about it.68 We draw from 
successful recruitment and data collection methods used 
in this HRSA grant to inform the proposed study. Second, 
in 2014, we (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_14628]; Co -Is: Patzer and Perryman) 
were funded by [CONTACT_14670] (Donate Life, 
Georgia) by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_14632] a web - based 
intervention that targets AA adults. This ongoing study entailed adapting the Giv ing ACTS DVD for an online 
environment and is in the midst of data collection at the time of this writing so preliminary data are  
not yet available, but it provided useful experience converting a DVD to a web -based intervention relevant to 
the current study.  
C.3. Specific Aim 1 : To develop and refine a web -based version of Living ACTS.  We will adapt our 
existing intervention for an online environment. The Internet provides an ideal mechanism for 
delivering Living ACTS.  Because few DVD players exist in transplant centers, it supports the 
sustainability of the intervention beyond the lif e of the study. Additionally, patients can go home 
and watch the video with family, multiple times if desired. Finally, in a way that a DVD cannot, it 
affords the option to directly c ommunicate with potential donors by [CONTACT_14671] (e.g., Facebook posts) to communicate the need for a LDKT.  
Website & Video Development. We will be updating our existing WebACTS (HRSA -funded project) website 
(the web address for the test site is: http://actnow.projectwebacts.org/#/), which seeks to increase registration 
on the Georgia state donor registry. The new website will be similar to  the look and feel of our existing website 
except that the current “ACT Now” tab that provides a mechanism for registration on the state donor registry 
will be replaced with an “ACT Now” tab that informs friends/family of LDKT as a viable treatment option for the 
patient. The website will also include the ability to pi[INVESTIGATOR_14633] (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) as well as traditional media (i.e. email and printed letter) w ith friends 
and families their need for a KT, and more information about LDKT (including a link to the Living ACTS 
website).  
We will contract with Tomorrow Pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], Inc., a film company we have worked with for the past 14 years, to 
refine the Living ACTS video. We anticipate shortening the video from 30 to 20 minutes and making minor 
edits using existing footage. The website wi ll be hosted on the Emory server, which offers the benefit of a 
secure server free of charge and technical support from our existing Department of Information Technology. 
Our team of content area and research experts will work closely with them to provide feedback on graphical Table 1. Overview of Living ACTS Intervention  

Version Date: 9/16/20  representations of our site until the desired look, feel, and functionality is accomplished. The content of the 
website will largely come from the existing Living ACTS educational booklet. The research team will be 
responsible for revising the content to m ake it more appropriate for a website and sharing it with the web 
developers. Web developers will perform usability testing on the website and videos to ensure basic 
functionality (i.e. working links, functional videos, etc.) prior to completing a draft we bsite with the embedded 
videos. We will explore the possibility of creating a mobile version of the website to facilitate participants’ ability 
to navigate from smartphones and tablets.   
Website Testing & Refinement. We will seek to gain feedback from [ADDRESS_14047] 
with the learning tool. All feedback will be used to refine and finalize the intervention website.  
Sample. Eligible participants for the interviews will: 1) self -identify as African American or Black; 2) be 
between the ages of 18 and 65; 3) have a diagnosis of end -stage renal disease and are currently undergoing 
evaluation for a transplant, or have received a t ransplant 4) be English speaking; 5) be willing to participate in 
an individual interview lasting 1 – 1 ½ hours, 6) be willing to be audio -taped and have website usage recorded 
via a recording app (“Record it!”). For the purpose of this study, the term “Black” includes people of African 
descent regardless of cultural identification. Individuals will be excluded from participating in this study if they 
do not meet these eligibility criteria or if they do not understand English.  
Recruitment. We will recruit participants via 2 mechanisms: 1) from existing contacts, including patient 
advocates who participate in the Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition, and 2) approaching patients in the 
Emory Transplant Clinic who are awaiting an evaluation  appointment. Individuals in this Coalition have 
previously expressed interest and participated in providing feedback for projects related to kidney donation and 
transplantation. Permission from Transplant Center will be obtained prior to appr oaching patients. Our goal is 
to recruit a broad cross -section of individuals (i.e. participants who vary by [CONTACT_547], age, etc.) to ensure that the 
website feedback represents a diverse pool of individuals.  
Those who are interested in participating in the study will complete a brief eligibility screener via telephone or 
in-person, depending on the recruitment method. The project coordinator will record all answers via a paper 
form and inform the individual of  his/her eligibility status. If the person is ineligible based on the telephone 
rescreening, the coordinator will inform him/her that he/she is ineligible for the study and thank him/her for 
his/her time (see Website Interview Screening Questions document for ineligibility response). If found eligible, 
the participant will conduct the interview on the spot, or schedule a convenient time to conduct the interview. 
The project coordinator will explain what study participation entails and the $[ADDRESS_14048], the facilitator will provide the participant an IRB -approved consent form to review and sign. The facilitator 
will offer any clarifications for language in the IRB as requested by [CONTACT_2299], and once signed, provide a 
copy of the consent form to the participant.  
Next, the facilitator will provide a brief overview of the purpose of interview and what the interview will entail. 
The participant will be asked to browse the website and then will be asked a series of questions assessing his / 
Version Date: 9/16/20  her perception of the design, comprehension, function and cultural competence of the website (see attached 
Living ACTS Interview Guide). During the ‘Website Tasks’ portion of the interview, participants will be asked to 
complete a series of instructions br owsing the website to test how easily individuals can find useful information 
within the website (e.g., “You’re on the home page and want to learn more about the risks and benefits of 
transplantation. How do you go about doing that?”). Lastly, participants  will be asked a few final questions 
about their overall thoughts and recommendations regarding the website. The interview facilitator will take 
detailed notes regarding the participant’s feedback. All discussions will be audio -recorded in the case that 
participants’ feedback needed to be referenced in the future. Additionally, participant activity on the study 
website will be recorded using the “Record it!” application. This will provide information about how much time 
the participant spends on the study w ebsite, which modules he/she explores and frequency, and overall 
interactions with the website. At the conclusion of the interview, participants will be given a $[ADDRESS_14049] overall feedback from 
participants.  
Measures (see attached Interview Guide)  
1. Review of the consent form  
[ADDRESS_14050] the interview at any time and can stop participating in the study at any time. The facilitator will gauge 
each participant’s comfort level and address any concerns that arise at that time as there may be other risks, 
discomforts or side effects that are not yet known.   
Benefits to Subject. Taking part in this activity may not benefit participants personally; however, information 
that is shared will help us modify the website to enhance its effectiveness.  
Version Date: 9/16/20  Data Analysis. Each interview facilitator will maintain detailed notes of the participant’s feedback. At the 
conclusion of the interviews, each facilitator will compi[INVESTIGATOR_14634]. Audio recordings from each group will be referenced in cases where the facilitator’s notes 
need to be cross -referenced. Video recordings from the “Record it!” app will be reviewed to identify 
participant’s use of the intervention website. Once all [ADDRESS_14051].   
Confidentiality. Study participants' names will remain confidential.  Names will not appear in the data 
collection documentation. However, names will be used for scheduling the interview sessions and distributing 
participant incentives. The names, email addresses, and tele phone numbers of potential participants who are 
ineligible for the study will be discarded. Informed consent documentation will be stored in a separate location 
from participant data. Thus, the data will not be linked to participant identi fiers. We do not expect to share 
study findings beyond the website development company.  
Informed Consent. Prior to the interview, participants will be instructed to complete the consent form (see 
attached consent form). During the session, the interview facilitator will review the consent form including a 
brief introduction to the study purpose and what partic ipation entails. They will also be informed that the 
interview will be audio recorded, and website activity will be recorded, that their participation is voluntary, that 
they may revoke consent at any time throughout their participation, and that there is an incentive of a $[ADDRESS_14052].  
Informing Participants of Findings. We do not anticipate that this study will generate findings that will need 
to be related back to participants.  
C.4. Specific Aim 2 : To conduct an outcome evaluation of the newly created web -based Living ACTS 
intervention by [CONTACT_14652] a potential living donor 
among patients who receive Living ACTS to those who receive a control we bsite with an embedded 
educational video. We will test the efficacy of the web -based Living ACTS intervention among AA ESRD 
patients who started the transplant evaluation process at four Southeastern transplant centers.  
Study Sites. The efficacy of the web -based Living ACTS intervention will be tested in a multi -site, RCT at four 
large, adult kidney transplant centers that serve a diverse (primarily AA) population of ESRD patients. The 
transplant centers will include:  
1. Emory Transplant Center (Atlanta, GA)  
Emory Transplant Center (ETC) is the largest transplant center in Georgia. In fiscal year 2014, the ETC 
received 3,[ADDRESS_14053] at ETC, of whom 63% were African American. 
The ETC program performed 277 (183 deceased donor and 94 living donor) kidney transplants, with 69% of 
deceased donor transplants and 37% of living donor transplants for African American reci pi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  The ETC 
tracks all patient data, including living donor data (from inquiry to outcomes) through an electronic, 
HIPAAcompliant Oracle Business Intelligence platform called the Transplant Data Mart. In addition, the ETC 
was the first transplant center to pil ot the T -REX (Transplant Referral Exchange) platform that will be used in 
this study.  
Version Date: 9/16/20  2. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_14635] (Atlanta, GA) The 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_14636] (PTI) Kidney transplant program was established in Atlanta, GA in 1986, and 
the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_14637]. Currently PTI reaches out to provide 
follow up care to all transplanted patient s either at the main facility or at [ADDRESS_14054] in 2015, with 60% of candidates being African American. There were a 
total of [ADDRESS_14055] certified multi organ transplant surgeons. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_14638] 2010, and has partnered with Emory and other transplant cente rs 
to develop T -REX to help dialysis facilities and transplant centers communicate with one another and track 
education.  
3. Augusta University Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Center (Augusta, GA)  
The Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program at Augusta University in Augusta, GA has a dedicated kidney 
and pancreas transplant team that recognizes the special needs of patients. Augusta University had 416 new 
kidney waitlisted candidates at the end of 201 5, of which 55% were African American. This program is one of 
[ADDRESS_14056] kidney transplant in 1968 and has since performed over 2,300 kidney and kidney/pancreas transplants. 
In 2015, Augusta performed 207 kidney transplants (176 deceased donor and 31 living donor), with 16% living 
donor transpl ants for African American recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The enterprise's distinction as the state's academic health 
center ensures access statewide and beyond to the highest -quality health care, the newest biomedical 
breakthroughs and cutting -edge technology. Its integrated  and closely aligned with the Augusta Health System, 
which includes the Augusta Medical Center, specializing in the needs of the acutely ill in an ethnically diverse 
region; the award -winning Georgia Health Sciences Children's Medical Center, the second -largest children's 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14639]; the Georgia Health Sciences Cancer Center, the first of its kind in Georgia to offer Phase 1 
and Phase 2 clinical trials; and the Georgia Regents Medical Associates, a multi -specialty group that is the 
largest of its k ind in the region. These facilities, which include more than [ADDRESS_14057] over 500,000 
patient visits annually. Augusta University is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14640] T -REX, and has participated in shared data 
collection efforts with the Southeastern Kidney T ransplant Coalition since 2012.  
4. Medical University of South Carolina (Charleston, SC)  
Medical University of South Carolina  in Charleston, SC, has a patient -centered approach with short wait times 
and a high survival rate, despi[INVESTIGATOR_14641] -risk patients. MUSC specializes in living renal 
transplantation. At the end of 2015, there were [ADDRESS_14058] patients, with 73% of deceased 
donor transplants and 14% of living donor transplants for African American recip ients. MUSC has been a 
partner of the Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition since 2012, and has shared patient data with Emory 
and the Transplant Coalition partners for collaborative research in the past [ADDRESS_14059] specifically addressed decreasing disparities 
in living donor transplant among African Americans, which ensures appropriate infrastructure to continue the 
proposed work.  
Study Preparation.  
Version Date: 9/16/[ADDRESS_14060] 5 -6 patients in the main (ETC) 
study site.  
Finalization of Study Protocols.   Using feedback from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_14642], update IRB with any minor changes, and hold a multi -site webinar to discuss study 
protocols to ensure consistency across study sites, answer any quest ions that site collaborators may have, and 
finalize timeline.  
Trial Registration of Study. We will register the trial protocol at ClinicalTrials.gov.  
Creation of a Data Safety and Monitoring (DSM) Plan. A DSM Plan will be formed in the early months of the 
project and be given responsibility to review and approve the study methods and the analysis plan for all study aims. The 
DSM Plan will be organized by [CONTACT_6283]. Patzer and Arriola will include the PIs at eac h institution and key Coalition members 
with related experience (including health services researchers, methodologists, patients, social workers and biostatisticians ). 
The DSM Plan will consist of annual  teleconferences. At these meetings the study protocol, procedures, and any issues of 
concern related to research integrity will be discussed. Email correspondence or teleconferences between study sites may 
be arranged for any late -breaking issues . In addition, monthly monitoring of data is in place to ensure the assessment 
of data accuracy. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_14643]. We will follow Emory University I RB protoc ols to ensure patient safety as we 
plan on external study sites will be relying on Emory’s IRB. All patient data from each study site will be stored on 
a password -protected and encrypted computer, within a locked office and building. Only the PIs, project 
coordinator, and the data analyst will have access to any identifiable patient data throughout the study period. 
Participant Recruitment and Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria.  
Patient Recruitment Methods. To ensure that we target patients who are most likely to be medically eligible 
to receive a transplant, and yet also target patients as early in the transplant process as possible, a rigorous 
screening process will be utilized to screen patients who have b een referred for transplant evaluation.  
We will recruit participants by [CONTACT_14672], instructing those who are interested 
to contact [CONTACT_14673] a telephone number to be secondarily screened for participation. To 
ensure that we target patients w ho are most likely to be medically eligible to receive a transplant, components 
of the eligibility criteria (AA or Black and age 18 -70 years) will be posted on the flyer. Each transplant center 
will have its own flyer with appropriate contact [CONTACT_3031] f or that center. Please see attached flyer for further 
details.  
Through the Powerchart system, the project coordinator will review the schedule for the transplant center of all 
patients who will have or had an evaluation appointment during a 7 – [ADDRESS_14061] coordinator will also review some key patient demographics (race, 
sex, age, and BMI) to ensure eligibility for the study.  Additionally, acc ess to patient clinical charts will be 
accessed via Powerchart to confirm patient eligibility (i.e. transplant status, ESRD status, and additional 
eligibility criteria). The project coordinator will obtain the patient’s telephone number from Powerchart to call the 
patient to ask the patient to participate in the study. If the patient is willing to participate, the project coordinator 
will obtain the patient’s email address to send the appropriate Zoom video call information, appointment time 
and date. The p atient will be scheduled for a Zoom video call no later than a week from the initial phone call. 
The project coordinator will also call the patient one day before the scheduled Zoom video call to confirm the 
appointment with the patient. If the patient doe s not have zoom capabilities, the coordinator will set up a video 
call with the patient. The coordinator will also have the option to recruit a patient in -person at the transplant 
clinic. Data collectors will maintain all necessary clearances and perform r equired trainings to gain and 
maintain access to electronic medical records. Project coordinators will be rigorously trained on how to recruit 
and screen patients for study eligibility.  
Version Date: 9/16/20  Eligibility Criteria. All patients referred (from dialysis facility, chronic kidney disease clinic, or self) and 
scheduled for an evaluation at one of the four study sites within the study time period. Our screening process 
will be based on information gathered from either thei r referral form or electronic medical record and ensure 
that patients are:  
(1) AA or Black  
(2) age 18 to 70 years  
(3) have BMI < 39  
(4) are English -speaking (Language eligibility will be confirmed by [CONTACT_14674] 
a telephone call with the patient prior to the Zoom video call)  
Consent. Consent and data collection will be completed by [CONTACT_14675] a Zoom video call 
that was set up by [CONTACT_14676]. The project coordinator will provide interested participants a verbal 
summary of the study, information about the risks an d benefits of participation, and answer any remaining 
questions. Interested participants will be required to consent verbally for willingness to participate. The 
coordinator will share the screen with the consent form displayed for the participant  to review. An email with a 
link to the consent form will also be sent to the participant to review. If the participant does not have an email 
address, the coordinator will physically mail the informed consent to the participant. Please see the attached 
verbal consent form for details. The verbal consent will be recorded via videoconference or teleconference 
using the Zoom platform.  
Compensation. To maximize participation, we will offer a $[ADDRESS_14062] coordinator will read a baseline survey (via HIPAA -compliant SurveyMonkey software) aloud to the 
participant and enter data based on information given from the parti cipant. This will also allow those with lower 
literacy to still take part in the study without feelings of embarrassment. Please see attached baseline survey 
for further details.  
Study Arms & Delivery of Interventions.  Following consent, and baseline data collection participants will be 
randomly assigned to either:  
1) Usual Care,  which involves the provision of standard transplant education procedures at each 
transplant center, which entail reviewing a packet of information with the pre -transplant coordinator. 
While there are some minor differences in the educational information a bout transplant that patients 
receive at each study site, the overall purpose is the same: the packet serves to inform transplant 
candidates and their families about the option LDKT. In addition, participants will be provided an 
iPad/tablet to w atch a 10 -minute National Kidney Foundation videos about kidney disease and 
transplantation in their private room during their regularly scheduled KT evaluation. This video 
discusses information about transplant, but does not specifically address LDKT and is not 
culturallysensitive to the AA population ( https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidneytransnewlease ). 
2) Living ACTS website,  this involves the same procedures as above but also visiting the Living 
ACTS website and watch the Living ACTS video (embedded in the website). Participants will be given a 
time minimum to explore the website, as determined by [CONTACT_14677]. (https://www.projectlivingacts.org).   
Randomization. At each site, patients will be randomized to usual care or the Living ACTS website 
individuallevel intervention immediately following study consent and completion of the baseline measures 
using a simple, 1:1 randomization scheme. A random number generator program will designate patients’ study 
arm assignment. Randomization only applies to the individual -level intervention; clinical providers across both 
study conditions will utilize the health systems intervention, T -REX, to communicate with one another about 
patients’ transplant status. Once the patient has been assigned an arm from randomization, he or she will be 
Version Date: 9/16/[ADDRESS_14063] coordinator is not blind to study condition. However, the coordinator will not be involved 
with the main outcome analyses, and analysts will be blind to condition.  
Immediate Follow -Up Survey. Participants will complete the immediate follow -up survey ((via 
HIPAAcompliant SurveyMonkey software), which will be a shortened version of the baseline survey that omits 
the demographic questions. Again, patients will have the project coordinator read the  survey out loud and the 
coordinator will complete the  survey. Participants will then be offered $[ADDRESS_14064] strong oversight from study staff, and submit regular documentation to study staff on recruitment 
progress.  
Recruitment Timeline. Participant recruitment will occur in a staggered fashion across study site, starting with 
the main study site, to ensure that study investigators can make any necessary minor modifications to the 
study protocol.  
Measurement. Covariates and key outcome measures are described below and in Table 2.   
Independent Variable.  
The primary 
independent variable 
is study arm (National 
Kidney Foundation 
kidney education 
video vs. Living ACTS)  
Outcome Variables.  
There are several key 
endpoints that will be 
examined in this study. 
Primary Outcome:  The 
percent of patients 
with at least one living  
donor inquiry over 12 
months  
Secondary Outcomes:  
Psychosocial 
measures of 
knowledge, 
motivation, and self -
efficacy for the 
behavioral skills to 
discuss LDKT with 
others  Table 2. Outcome measures for randomized controlled trial (Aim 2)  

Version Date: 9/16/[ADDRESS_14065] one living donor inquiry by [CONTACT_14678]/family of the 
patient over 12 months from baseline (evaluation start). This discrete outcome has been used in prior 
studies69 and is a necessary step prior to LDKT. These data are currently captured for all patients as a discrete 
field from electronic medical record for each potential recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Inquiries are defined by [CONTACT_14679] a 
telephone inquiry to the transplant center ’s living donor (each center has a separate telephone line for this 
purpose). For each study site, a data collection form that captures potential recipi[INVESTIGATOR_14644] (i.e. study participant), 
date of living donor inquiry, and donor inquiry ID, will be securely obtained from each transplant center 
following  a 12 month period from enrollment. Data will be collected electronically for all study participants 
through a secure, HIPAA -compliant data server (QualityNet) that all [ADDRESS_14066] research  
a. a 25-item assessment of knowledge and understanding of donation/transplantation60,71  
b. a 9-item scale asking assessing motivation to ask a family member to be a living donor60 
c. a 10-item behavioral skills scale that measures confidence in initiating a conversation about LDKT60  
d. a 3-item behavioral intentions scale that measures intention to discuss LDKT with family members72 
e. a single -item measure of comfort in initiating conversation about LDKT73 
f. several items measuring demographic characteristics (age, gender, highest level of education)  
Study Size Justification & Power Calculation.  
Study Size Justification. There were an estimated 3,[ADDRESS_14067] in the four transplant center sites in 2015. The majority (61.9%) of the 
waitlisted patients were AA. Thus, we will have a pool of over 1 400 potential study participants over the four 
study sites over 1 year, which will ensure we will meet our estimated sample size of n=[ADDRESS_14068] patients 
(1:1 randomization). We expect that it is possible that ~25% of patients ev aluated will not be eligible for 
transplant and thus will not have the opportunity to have LDKT, and these patients not be considered in main 
outcome analyses.  
Power Calculation for Primary Endpoint. Based on preliminary data showing that the proportion of AAs with ≥ 1 
living donor inquiry is 12% at baseline, we have 80% power to detect a 7% difference between the intervention and 
control groups, accounting for potential correlation of patients within study sites (correlation on the same subject of 0.5), 
with α=0.05. We expect little attrition in this trial, since follow -up data on the number of living donor inquiries will be 
obtained through medical record review . Based on our prior trial,[ADDRESS_14069] >90% participation.  
Statistical Analysis Plan. We will initiate the analytical process by [CONTACT_14680], examining continuous variables for normality, and exploring the Cronbach’s alpha for relevant 
scales.  
- Our main analyses seek to answer the following hypothesis:  
H1: A greater proportion of participants who receive a culturally -sensitive website with embedded video 
(Living ACTS) will have at least one living donor inquiry over the subsequent [ADDRESS_14070] education.  
- Our secondary analyses seek to answer the following hypothesis:  
H2: Patients in the intervention (vs. control) group will have a significantly greater increase in 
knowledge, motivation, and self -efficacy for the behavioral skills to initiate a conversation about LDKT 
with family or friends from baseline to immediate foll ow-up 
To ensure adequate balance across study arms, baseline covariates will be compared using Student t tests 
and χ2 tests, as appropriate. Variables found to have significant differences (p <0.05) by [CONTACT_14681]: 9/16/[ADDRESS_14071] for lack of b alance in demographic or clinical characteristics between the two groups. For 
the main outcome, we will use generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) for adjusted analyses of the data, 
specifying the logit link function for the binary outcomes (i.e. at least  one living donor inquiry over 12 -month 
period). Treatment group will be the independent variable of primary interest, modeled as a fixed effect with the 
control group specified as reference group. We will also include fixed effects for any potential confo unding 
covariates noted in bivariable analysis. A random intercept will be considered to increase generalizability of 
results. To control for potential contamination bias over the course of the study, we will consider controlling for 
time of study entry.  
We will pursue a similar modeling technique as described above for secondary analyses except that change in 
each of the three dependent variables will be the continuous (vs. binary) outcomes. We will conduct 
exploratory analyses where we assess change in b ehavioral intentions and comfort in initiating conversations 
about LDKT as outcomes. All data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_14682]. Patzer and Arriola, who will be blinded to study allocation. SAS 9.3 (Cary, 
NC) will be used for all analyses.  
C.5. Specific Aim 3 : To conduct a process evaluation of the newly created web -based Living ACTS 
intervention by [CONTACT_14655] (reach, recruitment, fidelity, 
dose delivered, dose received, and context) for an online environment In Table 3 we describe what data 
will be collected, how, and when.  Table 3.  Process evaluation components and measures (Linnan & Steckler, 2002)  
Transplant center administrative 
records. Because of their role in 
the recruitment process, the 
transplant coordinators will be able 
to easily get information on 
aspects of the environment that 
may have influenced delivery of 
the intervention as well as data on 
the proportion of eligible 
participa nt who could have been 
recruited into the study. These 
data will be collected 
retrospectively at the end of data 
collection at each transplant 
center by [CONTACT_14683] . 
Immediate follow -up survey of participants. The immediate follow -up survey will include a measure of 
satisfaction with the website to inform our understanding of the “dose received” as part of the process 
evaluation. This 10 item measure will include four items that ask participants to rate their sa tisfaction with the 
video (in terms of its quality, informative nature, length, and trustworthiness), four items that rate the website 
more generally (in terms of the ease at which one can find and understand inf ormation, visual appeal, and 
trustworthiness), and two general questions about recommending the website to others and an opportunity to 
provide general comments. Questions 1 -8 will be used generate an overall satisfaction score that may be 
examined in rela tionship to other outcomes measured on the immediate follow -up measure.  
Website usage statistics. Our process evaluation will be informed by [CONTACT_14684], 
which is a platform for measuring attributes of website usage74, and “Record it!”, which is an application used 

Version Date: 9/16/[ADDRESS_14072] array of variables we can use to assess use of the 
intervention website such as average time spent on each page, number of starts/stops of the video, and use of 
the social media functions (e.g., to e -mail friends/family).  Google Analytics data will be used to assess 
grouplevel website usage (i.e. videos most watched, modules that participants spent the most time exploring, 
etc.). “Record it!” data, however, will provide individual -level website usage da ta in the form of video recordings 
of each participant’s website activity. Study staff will review each video and code participant website activity 
according to a pre -established code book. These individual reports will provide data that can then be linked  to 
individual -level questionnaire data so that we can perform exploratory data analyses to determine whether 
individuals in the intervention condition who used certain functions of the website (e.g., e -mailing 
friends/family) also demonstrate greater chan ge in the secondary outcomes (e.g., knowledge).  
Study records. We will use a screening eligibility form to determine eligibility for participation in the study 
across all sites. One form will be used for each potential participant. All screening questions will be asked of all 
participants even if the response to an ea rlier question disqualifies a patient from participation so that we can 
collect accurate data on reasons for ineligibility.  
D. Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_14645] / Institutional Review Board Approval. The study will be conducted in a manner that 
protects the rights of all human participants. Moreover, each aspect of the study will only be implemented once 
the proper Institutional Authorization Agreements have been approved by [CONTACT_14685] s ite’s 
Institutional Review Board (Emory, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_14646], Augusta, and Medical University of South Carolina).  
Confidentiality. Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Specifically, all data collected through this project will be kept in password -protected files on a 
passwordprotected server and/or in a locked office in a personnel only accessible location at each study site 
with access only to the Principal Investigator s and project staff.  Only information that has been generalized 
and/or deidentified will be shared.  
Subjects will be informed that participation in any part of this research study may result in a loss of privacy, since 
persons other than the investigators may view their study records if deemed necessary for oversight purposes. 
However; they will be ident ified by a unique identification number (“study number”), not by [CONTACT_2300], and any other 
identifying information (e.g. personal and/or contact [CONTACT_3031]) will be kept separate from the other data; all 
information will be kept in secure, password -protected fi les. Personal information will be encrypted and linked to 
the study number. Further, subjects will be told that unless required by [CONTACT_2371], only the study investigators, members 
of the project staff, and representatives of the Emory University and local Instit utional Review Boards will have 
the authority to review any study records.  In such case, they too will be required to maintain confidentiality.  
Potential harm (Risks and Benefits).  
Benefits:  Participants could potentially benefit from this study by [CONTACT_14686].  
Risks: The consent process will ensure that all patients are aware that participation is voluntary. Patients will be 
told specifically what information will be obtained from their charts. Patients will be told that there is no potential 
for risks of injury or bod ily harm by [CONTACT_6231]. A breach of confidentiality is possible; however, all 
of the patient records will be stored in a password -protected file on a password -protected computer on campus.  
Conflict of Interest  
Any investigator who has a conflict of interest with this study will have the conflict reviewed by a properly 
constituted Conflict of Interest Committee with a Committee -sanctioned conflict management plan. All Emory 
investigators will follow the Universit y conflict of interest policy.  
Version Date: 9/16/20  Publication Plan  
The results of this study may also be used for teaching, publications, further IRB -approved research and/or 
presentations at scientific meetings. If individual results are discussed, the identity of the subject(s) will be 
protected.

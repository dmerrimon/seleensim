 1.0 Background  
 
Obesity is a risk factor for nearly all cardiovascular (CV) di seases including coronary artery 
disease, hypertension, and heart failure. Obesity and its adverse cardiometabolic sequelae 
represent major and worsening public health burdens. In 2000, the World Health Organization 
declared obesity as the greatest threat to the health of We sternized nations.1 In the U.S. O besity 
accounts for over 400,000 deaths per year and affects 35% of the adult population.  
 
Increased cardiovascular risk in obese individuals appears to depend largely on the degree of 
metabolic dysregulation. Obese individuals without other metabolic risk factors (such as glucose 
intolerance, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], or central adiposity) have cardiovascular outcomes similar to those of 
lean individuals. In contrast, obese individuals with a high burden of metabolic risk factors are at 
very high risk of future events. Notably, interventions t hat improve insulin sensitivity2 and 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863]3 can reduce cardiovascular risk in obese individuals, even in the 
absence of weight loss.  
 
The poor effectiveness of lifestyle -based interventions highlights the need for new strategies to 
improve cardiometabolic health in obese individuals. Estimates suggest that over half of all 
Americans are currently attempting weight loss, and another quarter are at tempting to maintain 
achieved weight loss. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], many people never achieve significant weight 
reduction and weight loss recidivis m at one year approaches 90%.4,5 Thus, lifestyle -based 
interventions alone are unlikely to achieve significant  reductions in obesity -related 
cardiovascular risk at the population level. These data underscore the potential value of 
physiologic interventions directly targeting metabolic fitness in obesity.  
 
2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
Obesity is frequently accompanied by [CONTACT_597662], cardiopulmonary 
function, and peripheral insulin resistance. A large body of experimental and clinical data 
suggests that these abnormalities contribute to the increased cardiovascular and meta bolic risk 
in obese individuals, making them potentially attractive targets for intervention.  
 
Energy expenditure is a major determinant of weight gain and loss.6 The primary components of 
total energy expenditure are physical activity (30%), the thermic e ffect of food (10%), and 
resting energy expenditure (REE, 60%). Obese individuals have approximately 50% lower REE, 
indexed to body weight, compared with normal weight adults.[ADDRESS_789769] in 
efforts at weight los s and weight loss maintenance.  
 
Obesity is associated with reduced cardiopulmonary capacity. Maximal oxygen consumption 
during exercise is inversely related to body mass index and fasting insulin level.7,8 Furthermore, 
exercise capacity is strongly related  to clinical outcomes in obese individuals, highlighting its 
value as an endpoint in this population.9,10 
 
Increasing cGMP activity can be achieved pharmacologically by [CONTACT_597663] 5A (PDE5), which catabolizes cGMP. The clinically -available drugs sildenafil and tadalfil 
are specific inhibitors of PDE5 and multiple studies suggest that they have beneficial 
cardiometabolic effects.  
 
 
Protocol Version #:  7  4 
Protocol Date: 04/30/[ADDRESS_789770] used plasma or urine 
concentrations of cGMP as an index of “target -organ” responsiveness to NP, proposing the ratio 
of cGMP to natriuretic peptide (NP) concentrations as an index of NP sensitivity.  
 
We propose to evaluate energy expenditure in response to a metabolic intervention in which 
weight loss is not a direct target.  We hypothesize that PDE5 inhibition will increase resting 
energy expenditure, improve insuli n sensitivity, and increase the  cGMP/NP ratio in obese 
adults.  
 
Aim 1.  To examine the effect of PDE5 inhibition on energy expenditure in obese  
  adults.   
  Subjects will undergo a [ADDRESS_789771] of PDE5 inhibition on cGMP tone and circulating  
  mediators of cardiometabolic risk .  
  Subjects will undergo fasting blood draw at baseline and 12 week s to   
  measure cGMP and NPs.  The primary endpoint is cGMP/NP ratio at [ADDRESS_789772] secondary endpoints (e.g. fat mass, blood 
pressure) after getting approval from the data safety monitor and the study biostatistician. We 
will not perform any unblinded analyses of primary endpoints until study procedures are 
complete.  
 
  
3.[ADDRESS_789773]. Wasserman showed that 
sildenafil increases resting and ambulatory energy expenditure, independent of activity level. 
Sildenafil also conferred resistance to weight gain from high fat die t over 12 weeks. Finally, 
PDE5 inhibition improved insulin sensitivity and muscle glucose uptake assessed by 
[CONTACT_402842] -euglycemic clamp. These observations support measuring energy expenditure 
and insulin sensitivity as primary endpoints in a human trial of PDE5 inhibition.  
 
Prior observational studies

atherosclerosis.30 In analyses of >[ADDRESS_789775] demonstrated that lipi[INVESTIGATOR_597643] -bond content are associated with a higher risk of diabetes.34 
 
We examined metabolite profiles before and after OGTT in 377 non -diabetic Framingham 
Offspring cohort participants.35 Dynamic ch anges were observed in multiple pathways 
demonstrating the feasibility of altering metabolomic profiles in response to a metabolic 
intervention (glucose administration). We identified metabolite responses that distinguished 
individuals with and without ins ulin resistance, including in pathways not associated with insulin 
or glucose action. Findings from these studies support the use of metabolomic profiling to 
assess the effect of interventions such as PDE5 inhibition on pathways associated with 
cardiometab olic risk. Exploratory analyses may also allow the identification of additional 
metabolites related to increased cGMP signaling.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_597644]5 inhibition  
 
We conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_597645] -resistant individuals with  BMI > 
27 kg/m2. In double -blind fashion, individuals were randomized to receive tadalafil (20mg/day) 
or placebo for 3 months (n=53). During follow up, 3 subjects from the tadalafil arm compared 
with 2 subjects from the placebo arm withdrew from the study.  Reasons for withdrawal in the 
tadalafil arm included headache (n=1) and muscle aches (n=2). There were no instances of 
hypotension, visual disturbances, or serious adverse events among individuals randomized to 
tadalafil.  
 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we found improvement in the oral disposition index, a composite measure of 
insulin release and resistance (p=0.009). We also observed a trend toward improvement in the 
Matsuda index (p = 0.05). HOMA -IR improved significantly in subjects with BMI above the 
median (36 kg/m2) assigned to tadalafil (p=0.02 for comparison with placebo), but not in the 
entire sample (which included overweight individuals). There was no significant change in 
weight in either group. In additional preliminary work, we have performed hy perglycemic clamps 
in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance randomized to sildenafil (n=21) 25 mg TID or 
placebo (n=21) for 3 months. PDE5 inhibition improved the insulin sensitivity index and 
disposition index, measured by [CONTACT_597664] (both p<0.05).

 20. Menopause  
 21. Inability to exercise on a bic ycle 
  
 
Rationale for Exclusion Criteria:  
1) Given the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease and hypertension in older obese 
subjects, we will exclude individuals over age 50 from the study. Our institutional IRB defines 
adults as 19 years and ol der. 
2) Given our intent to study the effects of this medication in clinically obese individuals, we will 
exclude individuals with BMI < 30 kg/m2.  
3) Given the potential for mild changes in blood pressure and the potential interaction of tadalafil 
with ant ihypertensive medications, we will exclude subjects with low -normal blood pressure and 
those requiring treatment with anti -hypertensive medication during the study.  
4) Given the possibility for hypotension when tadalafil and anti -hypertensive medications a re 
combined, we will exclude subjects currently taking anti -hypertensive medications.  
5) Given the potential for severe hypotension when combining tadalafil and nitrates, we will 
exclude individuals taking nitrates.  
6) Given the possibility for interaction  between two medications from the same class and the 
intent to study the native effects of the medication, we will exclude individuals already taking a 
PDE-5 inhibitor.  
7) Given the increased likelihood of a second reaction in those who have already experi enced a 
prior side effect of a PDE -[ADDRESS_789778] had a previous reaction to 
a PDE -5 inhibitor (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil).  
8) Given the inhibition of CYP3A4 and subsequent elevation of tadalafil levels by [CONTACT_597666], which are used only to treat HIV infection, we will exclude individuals with known HIV 
infection.  
9) Given their potential effects on CYP3A4 activity and, as a result, tadalafil levels, we will 
exclude individuals taking oral ketoconaz ole, itraconazole, erythromycin, rifampin, phenytoin, or 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]; topi[INVESTIGATOR_597646]3A4 activity.  
10) Given the temporal association of myocardial infarction, angina, uncontrolled cardiac 
arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or seizure with tadaladil in post -market 
surveillance (which has not been directly attributed to the drug itself), we will exclude those with 
a past history of these conditions.  
11) Given the temporal association of NAIOR with tadalafil in post -marketing surveillance, we 
will exclude those with this condition from the study.  
12) Given the temporal association of hearing loss with tadalafil in po st-marketing surveillance, 
we will exclude those with this condition from the study.  
13) Given the altered metabolism of tadalafil in subjects with renal dysfunction, we will exclude 
those with abnormal renal function (by [CONTACT_597667]).  
14) Giv en the altered metabolism of tadalafil in subjects with hepatic dysfunction, we will 
exclude those with transaminase levels more than three times the upper limit of normal.

Protocol Date: 04/30/2019  
 15) Given the untested effects of tadalafil on pregnant or breastfeeding women, we will exclude 
women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are able to become pregnant and not 
practicing an acceptable method of birth control during the study (including abstinence).  
16) Given the increased risk of priapi[INVESTIGATOR_597647], indivi duals with a prior history of 
priapi[INVESTIGATOR_144466].  
17) Given that alcohol use in excess of four drinks at one time combined with tadalafil 20mg can 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_597648], individuals who consume more than this amount daily will be excluded.  
18) Giv en that we are interested in determining the effect of tadalafil on insulin resistance and 
metabolism, we will exclude individuals who are taking or are at risk of starting medication for 
diabetes treatment, which would affect these measures.  
19) Given tha t blood samples will be taken at three time points over the 3 month study, we will 
exclude individuals with known anemia.  
20) Given the menopause affects energy balance in females, we will exclude menopausal 
women, determined via interview  
21) Given that o ne of the objectives of our study is to investigate the effect of tadalafil on 
exercise capacity, we will exclude individuals who are unable to exercise on a bicycle.  
 
5.0 Enrollment  
 
Subjects will be recruited from Vanderbilt’s Research Notification Distribution List, Research 
Match, Subject Locator, and the Vanderbilt Nutrition and Diet Assessment Research Core. 
Within the distributions, a brief description of the study will be provid ed and a contact [CONTACT_597668]. Upon contact[CONTACT_597669], the potential participant will receive a 
complete explanation of the protocol procedures by [CONTACT_756].  
 
6.[ADDRESS_789779] evidence of abnormal glucose metabolism , the 
following tests will be conducted:  Hemoglobin A1C,  fasting glucose,  and fasting insulin. 
HOMA -IR will be calculated from fasting glucose and insulin.  The patient will also be 
screened to determine if C-peptide, metabolic  and blood counts are within normal limits.  
 
Subjects meeting exclusion criteria based on abnormal lab oratory values due to chronic, 
stable conditions may be enrolled at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_597649]’s 
treating physician.  
 
Urine testing : A urine sample will be collected at screening, and if patient qualifies, at baseline 
and at 12 weeks , and a urine microalbumin will be measured. Samples may be stored for 
additional analyses.  
 
 
Protocol Version #:  7  9 
Protocol Date: 04/30/2019  
 Baseline  Testing: Baseline testing will take place over [ADDRESS_789780] approximately 4 hours. Determined by [CONTACT_597670], s ubjects will also 
receive a 7 week supply of tadalafil or the placebo at the second half -day visit. The study 
staff will  discuss how to take the  study  medication and a nswer any questions. The following 
protocols, tests, and surveys will be performed at baseline:  
 
Metabolic Chamber Protocol: The room calorimeter (2.6 m x 4 m; ~19 m3 volume) assures 
high-precision measurements of physiological variables (e.g. oxygen consumption, heart rate) in 
a controlled environment and semi -naturalistic conditions (i.e. not wearing a breathing mask or a 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]). The room is equipped with a bed, a television, a toilet, a sink, and an exercise 
bicycle . Accuracy and precision of the system for measuring EE is tested monthly using an 
alcohol combustion test. Precision averages 99.2 ± 0.5% (mean ± SD) over 24 hours and 98.6 ± 
2.1% over 30 minutes.  The system reliably  detects short -term changes in metabolic rate to 2.7% 
over 30 min and 0.6% over a [ADDRESS_789781] variability in resting energy 
expenditure was 3.5±2.2%. The operation of the room calorimeter is controlled and data are 
collected minute -by-minute using a cus tomized computer program. Subjects will arrive to the 
CRC after an overnight (~12 hour) fast, have vital signs and a blood sample taken before 
entering the chamber. Participants will enter the chamber at 8:00 am and remain there until 
12:00 pm. After enter ing the room, subjects will lie on the bed for 30 minutes. Resting energy 
expenditure  will then be averaged over the next 30 minutes while the patient remains on the 
bed. At approximately 9am, the patient will consume a meal containing approximately 25% of  
individual daily energy needs and containing 55% of energy from carbohydrates, 30% from fat, 
and 15% from protein. Diet composition will be determined using the Nutrition Data System for 
Research (NDSR) software.  
 
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test Protocol: The test will be conducted inside the metabolic 
chamber at the CRC according to the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines using an 
electrically -braked cycle ergometer. We have chosen the ergometer test because it may be 
better tolerated than the ex ercise treadmill by [CONTACT_597671], mechanical efficiency of individuals 
varies less, measurement of work performed is more accurate, and fatigue -induced change in 
work efficiency is feasible to measure. Heart rate and rhythm (12 -lead electrocardiogram), blo od 
pressure, breath -by-breath gas exchange, and power will be monitored or measured. Peak VO2 
uptake will be calculated (ml O2/kg/min) and the anaerobic threshold will be measured. The 
pedal cadence of ~50 revolutions per minute will be maintained via feed back from a display on 
the ergometer until voluntary termination of the task (i.e. reaching tolerable fatigue level). Based 
on our experience the test will last up to 45 minutes. The following measures will be calculated:  
• Energy expenditure (EE) rate (kca l/min): Oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon -dioxide 
production, air flow rate, temperature, barometric pressure, and air humidity will be 
measured minute -by-minute and integrated to calculate respi[INVESTIGATOR_38952] (RQ = 
VCO2/VO2) and EE using the Weir equation .56,57  
• Resting EE rate (kcal/min; REE): Calculated as the average EE during a [ADDRESS_789782] is lying in bed having fasted for ~12 hours.  
• Physical activity -induced EE (kcal/day): EE related to physical activity will be calculated 
as tota l EE above the resting level while performing the ergometer test.  
 
 
Fasting intravenous glucose tolerance test (FS -IVGTT) Protocol: We will conduct insulin 
modified FS -IVGTTs, which provide a validated estimate of insulin sensitivity and the acute 
insulin  response  to glucose (AIRg).7   The AIRg is a measurement of insulin secretion (i.e. beta 
 
 
Protocol Version #:  7  10 
Protocol Date: 04/30/2019  
 cell function). The disposition index accounts for the hyperbolic relationship between AIRg and 
SI and is associated with risk of diabetes.  After an overnight ~12-hour fast, subjects will assume 
a supi[INVESTIGATOR_597650] i n each arm, one for sampling and 
one for infusion, and allowed to rest for [ADDRESS_789783] baseline samples at t= -15 min and t= -5 min for measurement of glucose and 
insulin. At t=0, we will bolus 300 mg D -glucose/kg in a 25% glucose -saline sol ution over 1 
minute. At t=20 min, we will give a bolus of 0.02 units/kg of regular insulin followed by a 5 mL 
0.9% saline flush (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk, Princeton, NJ) intravenously, to improve the 
accuracy of the FS -IVGTT in patients in whom insulin respo nses are reduced or absent.8-13  Use 
of low dose insulin avoids saturation of insulin binding sites and maintains insulin concentrations 
in a range where insulin sensitivity is independent of insulin level. 14 Blood will be collected for 
measurement of gluc ose and insulin at t=2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16, 19, 22, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 
70, 90, 110, 130, 150, 170, and 180 min. We will estimate insulin sensitivity ( SI), glucose 
effectiveness at basal insulin ( SG), glucose disappearance constant ( Kg), AIRg, and disposition 
index using the MINMOD program (MINMOD Millennium v. 6.02).15-17 Plasma glucose will be 
determined immediately after bedside plasma centrifugation, using the glucose oxidase method 
(YSI 2300, Yellow Springs Instruments). Plasma insulin will  be measured by [CONTACT_597672] -80 °C until assay.  
 
Physical Activity (PA) : Total PA in the free -living environment will be measured using tri -axial 
accelerometers ActiGraph -GT9X+ (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL) for [ADDRESS_789784].  The raw data will be collected at 30 Hz,  preprocessed and converted 
to vector magnitude counts. After assessing monitor wear/no -wear time, the outcomes of 
interest will be total number of counts and time and spent in sedentary, light, moderate and 
vigorous activity intensities. Intra - and inter -individual differences in the amount and patterns of 
physical activity will be assessed using methods described in previous studies in adults.  
Subjects will be asked to wear the accelerometer for 7 days after their second baseline half -day, 
for 7 days befo re their interim visit, and for 7 days before their 12 -week visit.  
 
Quality of Life: Quality of life will be assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study Short -Form 
Health Survey (SF -36). The SF-36 is a generic, multi -item scale with eight domains that includ e: 
physical functioning, bodily pain, mental health, social functioning, vitality, general health 
perceptions, role limitations -physical, and role limitations -emotional. Individual subscale scores, 
a mental component summary score, and a physical component  score summary score are 
calculated.64 The SF -36 has been widely used to measure quality of life among patients with 
obesity and is sensitive to changes in weight and BMI.65,66 The International Index of Erectile 
Function (IIEF) will be used to measure sexual function in men. The IIEF addresses four 
domains of male sexual function (erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse 
satisfaction, and overall satisfaction) and is the gold standard for measuring erectile 
dysfunction.67 The Female Sexual Function Index will be used to measure sexual function in 
women. The FSFI is comprised of five domains: desire and subjective arousal, lubrication, 
orgasm, satisfaction, and pain/discomfort and is the most widely used measurement of fema le 
sexual function.68  A nurse practitioner ) with extensive experience 
administering quality of life surveys will perform these assessments.

 Dual -Energy X -ray Absorptiometry (DEXA): Body composition will be assessed at baseline 
and at [ADDRESS_789785] about 15 minutes.  
 
Interim Visit : This visit will take place approximately [ADDRESS_789786] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], perform a blood draw, and give 
subjects their next 6-week supply of the study medication.  
 
12 Week:  The tests performed at baseline (described above) will be performed approximately 
12 weeks after beginning the study medication.   
 
 
7.0 Optional Genetic and Future Research on Biological Samples  
 
As part of the informed consent, participants will be asked whether blood, not used in this 
analysis, may be stored for future analysis. If the participant does not consent to this, samples 
will be used only for the present study and excess samples discarded.  
 
8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems i nvolving Risk to 
Participants or Others  
Risks and Discomfort  
Tadalafil is a medication with proven safety. This drug was initially approved by [CONTACT_34033] 2003 
for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (under the trade name [CONTACT_597686]) at a starting dose of 
2.5mg and a maximum dose of 5mg for daily use and at a starting dose of 10mg and a 
maximum dose of 20 mg up to once daily for as needed use. Tadalafil 20mg daily has been 
used without serious adverse effects in a recent study of healthy men with mild erectile  
dysfunction. Safety data are provided in the package inserts and Physician Desk  
Reference (PDR through MICROMEDEX) entry and summarized here. In 200 9, the FDA 
approved use of this medication at a dose of up to 40mg daily for management in pulmonary 
arteri al hypertension (under the tra de name [CONTACT_358075]) based on Phase III clinical trial data. In 
pre-clinical safety data , tadalafil 20mg daily produced no significant decrease in supi[INVESTIGATOR_597651]/diastolic blood pr essure when compared to placebo (supi [INVESTIGATOR_597652] 
1.6/0.8 mm Hg and standing decreased by 0.2/4.6 mm Hg).   
 
Contraindications for the use of tadalafil are concomitant use of organic nitrates (because of 
severe hypotension) and a history of hypersensitivity reaction to tadalafil; individual s with those 
characteristics are excluded from this study. Individuals using anti -hypertensive medications are 
at increased risk of having low blood pressure when using tadalafil, and these individuals are 
excluded from this study as well. Safety testing a nd post -marketing surveillance have identified 
serious potential side effects for which study subjects could be at risk. These include myocardial 
infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmias, stroke, sudden visual loss, 
sudden heari ng loss, and priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801]. These conditions are all rare, and whether they are directly 
related to tadalafil use is unclear. Individuals with a history of these conditions are excluded 
from the protocol. Study subjects are advised to stop taking tadalafil and seek medical attention  
immediately should they experience any of the above or symptoms that may indicate any of the 
above. The most common adverse reactions experienced during pre -clinical safety trials and 
post-surveillance marketing for individuals takin g tadalafil 20mg daily are: headache (15%), 
dyspepsia (10%), back pain (6%), myalgia (3%), nasal congestion (3%), flushing (3%), and pain 
in a limb (3%). In a study of otherwise healthy men with mild erectile dysfunction, tadalafil 20mg 
daily for 9 months was associated with the following adverse events: headache (16%), back 
 
 
Protocol Version #:  7  12 
Protocol Date: 04/30/2019  
 pain (14%), dyspepsia (8%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (8%), myalgia (8%), pain (4%), 
pain in an extremity (4%), dizziness (3%), and nasopharyngitis (3%) [23].  
 
Because headache is  a relatively common side effect of the me dication,  we will ask subjects to 
contact [CONTACT_597673] a persistent headache. If it is determined by [CONTACT_597674]’s symptoms indicate a need to decrease the subject’s 
dosage, the dosage may be decreased to 10mg daily. After adjusting the dose of the 
medication, study personnel will com municate with subjects and the dose may be readjusted as 
symptoms decrease. Board certified Internist/Cardiologists (the MPIs) are available by [CONTACT_597675], if not physically present, during the study.  
 
Venipuncture  
The risks of draw ing blood are uncommon and may include bleeding, minor infection and 
bruising. Commonly, having blood drawn is painful, and rarely can lead to infection at the site of 
the blood draw. The amount of blood drawn is small, and represents an exceedingly small 
percentage of the amount of the total blood volume and will not represent a significant risk to the 
subject.  
 
Subjects will be removed from the study if symptoms or medical issues arise that are deemed 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_597653]. A few examples  are listed here:  
 1) If the participant has or develops clinically significant contraindications to taking the 
study drug.  
 2) If the participant has or develops  clinically significant  lightheadedness, particularly 
when standing at any blood pressure.  
 3) If the participant develops systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg when seated 
 or standing.  
 4) If clinically  significant anemia is identified  
 
As stated in the consent form and reviewed at the time of enrollment, subjec ts may end 
participation at any time without prejudice.  
 
Adverse Events  
Investigators will report all serious, unexpe cted, and study -related adverse events to the Data 
Safety Monitor and the local Institutional R eview Board in a timely manner according to IRB 
Policies and Procedures.  
 
Adverse event reporting: It is proposed that events possibly related to the study will be graded 
by [CONTACT_597676]:  
 Adverse Event (AE) Grading Scale:  
 0= No Adverse Event or within norm al limits  
 1= Mild Severity: Transient laboratory test alterations; discomforts noted but no 
 disruption of daily activities; no therapy, or only symptomatic therapy required  
 2= Moderate Severity: Laboratory test alterations indicating injury without long -term risk; 
 discomfort sufficient to modify normal daily activity; specific therapy required (i.e., more 
 than symptomatic)  
 3= Serious Severity: Laboratory test indicating a serious health threat or permanent 
 injury; incapacity, inability to work, inabi lity to perform normal daily activity; 
 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_412231]; emergency treatment required; life -threatening 
 events; death  
 
 
 
Protocol Version #:  7  13 
Protocol Date: 04/30/2019  
 f) Breech in confidentiality that may involve risk to that individual or others;  
g) Complaint of a participant tha t indicates an unanticipated risk or which cannot be resolved by 
[CONTACT_16133]; or  
h) Other event that is unanticipated, involved risk to participants or others and was possibly 
related to the research procedures.  
 
Adverse events of a serious severity  thought to be related to the research p rotocol will be 
reported to the NIH, the Vanderbilt IRB, the DSM and Drs. Wang and Brittain [ADDRESS_789787] th e responsibility to confirm the  severity of the adverse event, determine if it is 
likely that the adverse event was related to the study, and make  recommendations for 
continuation, modification or cessation of the study. Da ta monitoring will routinely be performed 
by [CONTACT_6283]. Wang and Brittain and in response to the reports of serious adverse events.  
 
9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
We plan to monitor closely for adverse effects and remove a subject for symptoms deemed 
related to study drug. The inability to tolerate tadalafil or hypersensitivity to drug will trigger 
withdrawal. Furthermore, the DSM has the ability to stop the study for safety concerns.  
If at any time during the study, participants decide they do want their blood samples or 
metabo lic chamber data analyzed or included in the study results, they can contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_597654] (all contact [CONTACT_597677]). At that point, the 
patient’s data would be removed from the electronic database.  
 
10.0 Statistical Considerations  
Aim 1:  
Statistical analysis: We will test the effects of tadalafil versus placebo on the primary endpoint 
(resting energy expenditure) and the secondary endpoints, in similar fashion. We will use a 
generalization of the Wilcoxon test – the proportional odds ordinal logistic model – with the week 
[ADDRESS_789788] rank and 
then apply the proportional odds model. In exploratory analyses, we will also study whether 
treatment effects differ by [CONTACT_336894]. These pre -defined analyses will be performed for 
sex, race (white or non -white), and B MI. We will also perform sensitivity analyses excluding 
those non -compliant with study pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (missing ≥ 2/3 doses).  
 
Statistical power: Power analysis is based on an approximation to the proportional odds 
analysis controlling for baseline by [CONTACT_18647] (a nalysis of change) instead of regression. Data 
on the within -individual standard deviation (SD) of resting energy expenditure are limited, 
particularly from the metabolic chamber. Thus, as an approximation we used the between -
individual SD (364 kcal) from our prior studies of 108 obese (BMI 32 kg/m2, 56% female) 
individuals. We estimate the correlation between pre - and post -treatment measurements to be 
0.[ADDRESS_789789] change is also 364 kcal.  We model several scenarios, 
up to a dro pout rate of 15%, a high estimate. Even with a dropout of 15%, we will have excellent 
power (84%) to detect a relatively modest [ADDRESS_789790] set the p -value threshold at 0.0 5/2 = 0.025, to 
account for the 2 primary clinical endpoints in the proposal (corresponding to Specific Aims 1 
 
 
Protocol Version #:  7  14 
Protocol Date: 04/30/2019  
 and 2). 182 kcal represents ~10% of the total daily energy expenditure for an obese adult from 
our prior studies.  
 
Aim 2:  
Statistical analysis: The analytic approach will parallel that described for Aim 1 (substituting the 
endpoints from Aim 2). The primary analyses will focus on the effect of PDE5 inhibition on 
insulin sensitivity (SI). Secondary analyses include measures of insulin sec retion (AIRg, and 
disposition index), body composition, and quality of life.  
 
Statistical Power: We selected the sample size based on the baseline insulin sensitivity (SI) 
measured by [CONTACT_597678] -IVGTT in a prior study of patients with insulin resistance and on the  magnitude 
of effect of PDE5 inhibition on insulin sensitivity in our preliminary data. A higher SI indicates 
better insulin sensitivity. We plan to enroll 100 subjects per arm and allow up to a 15% dropout 
rate over [ADDRESS_789791] 90% power with 
alpha 0.[ADDRESS_789792] a 23% increase in SI from a baseline of 5.89±2.75 x10 -4•min -1 per mU/L 
(mean ± SD) versus no change in the placebo arm. We observed a 30% increase in Si in our 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_597655] a lower equival ent dose of PDE5 inhibitor over a shorter study duration. 
Therefore, we will have excellent power to detect a modest effect of PDE5 inhibition. The 
baseline AIRg from our prior studies in a similar population was 577.3±259.8. With [ADDRESS_789793] 90% power to detect a 25% increase in AIRg, the 
other component of disposition index. In prior studies we observed within -subject correlations of 
0.7-0.8 for repeated IVGTT measurements (SI, AIRg), but we based our power estimates on a 
more conservative within -subject correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_789794] observed that the acute (AIRg) - and late -phase insulin 
secretion and disposition index are significantly increased in African Ame rican subjects 
independent of body mass index or insulin sensitivity.21,22 We will address this by [CONTACT_597679] (in addition to gender) at the time of randomization.  
 
Aim 3:  
Statistical analysis: The analytic approach will parallel that described f or Aim 1 (substituting the 
endpoints from Aim 3). We will also assess the correlation of the change in cGMP/NP ratio with 
the change in the primary endpoints (energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity) in the active arm 
and in the overall sample.  
 
Although t he metabolomics studies are exploratory, we will adjust the statistical significance 
threshold for metabolite comparisons using a conservative Bonferroni correction (p = 0.05/300). 
As a secondary analysis we will do variable clustering to empi[INVESTIGATOR_597656] -cluster correlations are high and between -cluster correlations of 
individual metabolites are low. Each cluster will be summarized by [CONTACT_597680]. This reduces 
multiplicity problems and focuses power.  
 
Statistical power: Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the within -individual SD of cGMP/NP over 12 weeks 
in the absence of intervention is 3.6 pmol/pg. With 85 completed subjects per arm (assuming 
15% dropout), we will have 90% power with alpha 0.[ADDRESS_789795] a 19% increase in cGMP/NP. 
We observed an increase of 85% in cGMP/NP in tadalafil -treated subjects in our smaller pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], with a smaller sample. Thus, we will ha ve excellent power to detect modest effects. 
Analysis of metabolites and VEGF -A165b measurements are considered exploratory; therefore, 
power calculations were not specifically performed for those endpoints.

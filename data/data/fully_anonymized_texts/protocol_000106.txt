6. SPECIFIC  AIMS  
Certain neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by a brain -based deficit in the ability to effectively  
inhibit, or “gate” sensory, cognitive or motor information. To study the physiological basis of this inhibitory  
deficit, we use prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex as an operational measure of sensorimotor  
gating. We study the acoustic startle reflex, including prepulse inhibition (PPI) and prepulse facilitation of  
startle  in neuropsychiatric  patients  and appropriate  control  comparison  populations.  
 
A substantial literature of preclinical studies demonstrates that prepulse modification of the startle reflex,  
including PPI, is regulated by [CONTACT_67163]. Among these, brain dopamine (DA)  
activity is known to regulate PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67078] D2 -family receptors in portions of the striatum. PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854879]. These and related animal  
studies have allowed us to identify a specific neural circuitry, conn ecting limbic cortical structures, through  
their basal ganglia efferents, to pontine structures, that regulates the amount of sensorimotor gating, as  
measured by [CONTACT_67164].  It would be critically important to determine whether these same substrates regulating  
PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67080], could be extrapolated to humans, and thus allow us to interpret the neural basis for abnormal  
patterns  of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854880].  
 
In a series of studies, we investigated the neurochemistry of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67082], by [CONTACT_854930] [INVESTIGATOR_854881], using adequate  sample sizes,  agonist -antagonist  
interactions  and informative  dose -response  profiles  where  possible.  The similarities  and differences  
between the responses to pharmacological manipul ations in humans and rats provide important evidence  
for understanding  the neural circuit  substrates  of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67082].  
 
Differences in sensorimotor gating also distinguish certain groups of normal subjects. For example, lower  
levels of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67084]/Val vs. Met/Met alleles for the  
Val158Met polymorphism of the gene for catechol -O-methyltransferase. In other cases, differences in PPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_67085]. For exam ple, amphetamine differentially  
changes PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67086]. high novelty seeking personalities. For  
these reasons, some of our studies interrogate specific genetic and personality characteristics of our test  
subjects: geno typi[INVESTIGATOR_67087], and specific questionnaires are used to evaluate  
personality  and behavioral characteristics  of the study  populations.  
 
Differences in sensorimotor inhibition will be detected by [CONTACT_67166], but not other laboratory -based measures,  
reflecting  differences  in the particular  psychophysical  demands  of the measure.  To add to our 
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page 3  understanding  of patterns  of sensorimotor  inhibition  across  normal  and patient  populations,  and of 
changes in sensorimotor inhibition in response to specific manipulations of brain circuitry thought to  
regulate one form of sensorimotor inhibition (PPI), we also assess Latent Inhibition, Negative Priming,  
Mismatch  Negativity  and Gamma  Band  Synchronization  in some  of our study  groups.  
 
Importantly,  measures  of sensorimotor  gating  are associated  with higher  brain  functions,  including  
neurocognitive processes. Thus, in some cases, our subjects complete measure s of neurocognition,  
designed specifically to assess drug effects on processes such as working memory. In this way, we can  
test the hypothesis that drug -induced increases in sensorimotor gating can contribute to neurocognitive  
improvements in  patients  popu lations.  
 
Our current  studies  are designed  to achieve  3 Specific  Aims (see  Figure  1): 
 
1. To assess the effects of the indirect dopamine agonist, d -amphetamine, on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854882], and the moderating roles of personality and genotype in these effects. [ADDRESS_1190486] study of placebo vs. 20 mg amphetamine (p.o.) on two separate  
days, completing measures of sensorimotor gating and neurocognition on each test day. All subjects will  
be characte rized  in terms  of specific  genetic  and personality  characteristics.  
 
2. To assess the effects of the NMDA antagonist, memantine, on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854883], and the moderating roles of personality and genotype in these effects. [ADDRESS_1190487] study of placebo vs. 20 mg memantine (p.o.) on two separate days, completing  
measures  of sensorimotor  gating  and neurocognition  on each  test day. All subjects  will be characterized

3. To assess the effects of the NMDA antagonist, memantine, on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854884], and the moderating roles of genotype in these effects. [ADDRESS_1190488] study of placebo vs. 10 mg memantine (p.o.)  
(n=30)  or placebo  vs. 20 mg memantine  (n=30)  on two separate  days,  completing  measures  of 
sensorimotor gating and neurocognition on each test day. All  subjects will be characterized in terms of  
specific  genetic  characteristics.

7. BACKGROUND  AND  SIGNIFICANCE  
The startle reflex is a constellation of responses to sudden, relatively intense stimuli that is usually  
classified as a defensive response. One major advantage of startle response paradigms is that the same  
phenomena can be studied across species. In humans, the blink reflex component of the startle response  
is measured  using  electromyography  of the orbicularis  oculi muscle.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_854885] , startle  
demonstrates  several  forms  of plasticity  - including  habituation  and fear-potentiation  - that are regulated  
by [CONTACT_854931].  Even  these  more  complex  processes  exhibit  striking  similarities  across  species,  
from rodents to humans. One form of startle plasticity is "prepulse inhibition" (PPI), which is the normal  
suppression of the startle reflex, which occurs when the intense startling stimulus is preceded by a weak  
prestimulus.  
 
In PPI, a weak prepulse inhibits a reflex response to a p owerful sensory stimulus. PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854886]. PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854887], including humans. It is not a form of conditioning, since it occurs on the first 
exposure to the prepulse and pulse stimuli, and it does not exhibit habituation or extinction over multiple  
trials. PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67093] a ubiquitous "hard -wired" centrally mediated behavioral  
"gating" process.  The PPI  [INVESTIGATOR_854888]. The inhibitory processes activated by [CONTACT_67168] "prepulse" and the resulting  
decrement in startle amplitude are used in an operational definition of sensorimotor g ating: the degree to  
which  startle  amplitude  is inhibited  by a prepulse  is a measure  of the amount  of sensorimotor  gating.  
 
Our interest in PPI [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a measure of sensorimotor gating grew from the observation that human disorders  
characterized  by [CONTACT_854932]  [INVESTIGATOR_854889] [ADDRESS_1190489] reported impaired PPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_67097], Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Huntington’s Disease, nocturnal  
enuresis and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or Tourette’s Syndrome.  These disorders are all  
characterized  by a loss of gating  in sensory,  motor  or cognitive  domains,  and are characterized  
neurologically  by [CONTACT_854933] -striato -pallido -pontine  circuitry that  modulates  PPI. 
 
Over  the past 20+ years,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_854890]. These  studies have revealed that PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854891] (temporal and medial prefrontal cortex), the ventral striatum, the ventral pallidum and the  
pontine tegmentum. This limbic cortico -striato -pallido -pontine circuitry then interfaces with the primary  
startle circuit at the level of the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis. The neurotransmitters active at each  
level of this circuitry have been studied as well: the cortico -striatal interface involves interactions between  
glutam ate and D2 dopamine receptors; the striato -pallidal input is GABAergic, as is the pallido -pontine  
input. Thus, by [CONTACT_67171] [INVESTIGATOR_67100], we are able to use this  
information to understand the pathophysiology of  these disorders, as well as to develop strategies for  
designing  optimal drug  treatments.  We have  already  made  significant  steps  towards  these  ends.  
 
Some evidence already suggests that findings from preclinical studies of the neural substrates regulating  
PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67101]  “cross  species” and be applied to humans. For example, PPI  [INVESTIGATOR_854892]’s Disease (HD), and in rats with cytotoxic lesions of striatal regions that model features of the  
pathophysiology of HD. Preliminary stud ies suggest that the “cross -species” parallels of this measure can  
also be demonstrated with pharmacologic probes: PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854893] (e.g. amphetamine) and by [CONTACT_67172] (e.g. bromocriptine and apomorp hine). These  
pharmacologic studies of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67104], since they were either  
performed only in small samples, or in patients with neurologic disorders (e.g.. Parkinson’s Disease) that  
might  complicate  interpretation  of the findings  as they relate  to the normal  neural  regulation  of PPI. 
 
More  recent  studies  have  clarified  that the sensitivity  of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854894], including the presence of specific genes, and personality dimensions  
associated with those genes. For example, several groups have reported that PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854895]158Met polymorphism. In these studies, the Val/Val allele is associated with high COMT activity, rapid  
DA catabolism, high novelty seeking scores, low basal PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67107] -enhancing effects of the COMT  
inhibitor,  tolcapone.  In contrast,  the Met/Met  allele  is associated  with low COMT  activity, low DA 
catabolism, low novelty  seeking scores, high basal PPI,  and PPI -reducing effects of tolcapone.  We 
previously reported that rats expressing high levels of COMT within the ventral striatum exhibit PPI - 
enhancing effects in response to DA agonists, like amphetamine, while rats expressing low levels of  
COMT  in this region  exhibit PPI -reducing  effects  in response  to amphetamine.  More  recently,  we 
confirmed that normal women with high novelty seeking scores (who as a group predominantly expres s 
the Val/Val  high activity COMT allele) respond to amphetamine  with elevations of  PPI, while those  with 
low novelty seeking (associated with the Met/Met low activity COMT allele) respond to amphetamine with  
reduced PPI. We also detected PPI -enhancing effe cts of the NMDA antagonist and weak DA agonist,  
memantine, among men exhibiting low baseline PPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or high novelty seeking, both of which are  
associated  with the Val/Val COMT genotype.  Thus, across species,  genetically determined  levels of  
COMT activity appear to moderate the impact of specific drugs on sensorimotor gating. These findings  
suggest a biological explanation for a genetically based "vulnerability" to the gating -disrupted effects of  
increased dopamine activity and/or reduced NMDA activity, tho ught to be core features of brain disorders  
such as schizophrenia and Tourette Syndrome. We now plan to extend this work to further clarify the role  
of COMT  polymorphisms  and other  genetic  substrates  on the sensitivity  of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854896].  
 
The most  recent  development  in our studies  has emerged  as other  groups,  as well as our own,  have  
reported that levels of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67109] (correlated) with specific neurocognitive processes,  
including  measures  of executive  functioning  and working  memory.  In the process  of our pharmacological  
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page 6  studies of PPI, we identified specific agents (e.g. memantine) that increased PPI, particularly among  
individuals with specific physiological (e.g. low baseline PPI) and psychological (e.g. high novelty seeking)  
"biomarkers" associated with the Val/Val COMT polymorphism. These two lines of findings led us to test  
whether such drug -induced increases in PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67110] - 
identified  subgroups.  If so, we might  be able to develop  laboratory -based  measures  for predicting  
procognitive  drug effects  in patient  populations  - particularly  among  disorders  associated  with impaired  
PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854897],  such  as schizophrenia.  
 
In total, we expect to accomplish three goals by [CONTACT_48775] a new line of research, investigating the effects  
of specific  pharmacologic  agents  on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854898]:  
 
1) Extension  of the preclinical  findings  into humans,  to allow  interpretation  of anatomical  and genetic  
correlates  of observed  behavioral deficits  in psychiatric  patients.  
 
2) Replicate  and extend  findings  in humans  with specific  pharmacologic  probes.  
 
3) Determine  the relationship  between  specific  drug effects  on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854899],  in 
healthy  and patient  populations,  as a function  of specific  physiological,  psychological  and genetic  
biomarkers.  
8. PRELIMINARY  STUDIES/PROGRESS  REPORT  
Psychophysiological measures and some other aspects of the protocol described in this application have  
been used for the past thirteen years in the PI's laboratory.   No untoward effects have been observed.  
The success of the protocol in evaluating sensorimotor gating encouraged us to expand this protocol to  
include the use of pharmacologic agents.  Results from our control population led to modifications in  
experimental designs that facilitate the detection  of subtle drug  effects and diffe rences in  control vs.  
patient  populations.  
 
Previous work of this type has been completed successfully at this institution and elsewhere. Specifically,  
[CONTACT_67208] undertook studies of the effects of d -amphetamine on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67082], and the present PI  
[INVESTIGATOR_30647] a co -investigator on that protocol (91 -516), which has now expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_854900], in collaboration with [CONTACT_67209] (96 - 
0003); ketamine and other NMDA antagonists disrupt PP I in rats.  Studies at other institutions have  
examined the effects of caffeine, ketamine, apomorphine, amphetamine, nicotine or bromocriptine on PPI  
(the latter  given  alone,  and in combination  with haloperidol);  as in rats, these  studies  report  that PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854901] (apomorphine, amphetamine, bromocriptine, ketamine) or enhanced (nicotine) in humans,  
and that the PPI -disruptive effects of DA agonists can be prevented by [CONTACT_941] D2 antagonist haloperidol.  In 
some  cases,  a lack of consistent  drug effects  on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854902]  “negative”  effects  
of pharmacological probes on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67117]. While PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854903], other proposed drugs had not been tested (e .g.. 
amantadine, pergolide, and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_854904],  in addition  to caffeine,  bromocriptine  and amphetamine,  and proposed  studies  will include  
memantine (see below).  Thus, the proposed studies are designed to both replicate and extend the  
literature  of the pharmacology  of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67082].  
 
As described in our past progress reports, we continue to actively test subjects using our proposed  
measures.  They  include  bilateral  measures  of eyeblin k acoustic  startle,  prepulse  inhibition  and 
habituation of acoustic startle, visuospatial priming and latent inhibition.  Additional variations of these  
measures  are developed  on a regular  basis  to enhance  their sensitivity.  
 
After  completing  a series  of studies  using  the non-DA stimulant  caffeine,  we undertook  a systematic  
series  of studies  to examine  the effects  of DA agonists  on startle  and related  measures  in normal  humans.  
We assessed  the time course  of action  of several  DA agonists  - pergolide  (0.025  and 0.1 mg), 
amphetamine  (20 mg), amantadine  (200 mg) and bromocriptine  (1.25  and 2.5 mg) - on startle  measures,  
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_1190490] reported that levels of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854905], and specifically, with working memory (WM); in schizophrenia patients,  
we reported that levels of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67122]. We also reported that  
the Alzhemier's  Disease  medication  and NMDA  antagonist,  memantine,  significantly  increases  PPI, 
particularly      among      individuals      with   Effects  of memantine (MEM)  vs. placebo  * 
phenotypes  - low baseline  PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854906] (PBO)  on WM  (%ile  score  from MCCB,  see 
novelty  seeking  - associated  with the Val/Val  text). WM was increased by [CONTACT_67173] [ADDRESS_1190491] the these subjects  (F=10.68,  p<0.015),  MEM  
hypothesis  that memantine  will increase  WM, also significantly increased PPI. This  
particularly  among  subjects  exhibiting  high ongoing  study  is conducted  with a double - 
memantine  PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67124].  Our initial  findings   blind,  balanced  order design.  PBO  MEM  
in a double -blind,  within -subject,  balanced  
order, placebo -controlled study, are quite promising: memantine (20 mg po) significantly increased WM in  
normal subjects, despi[INVESTIGATOR_854907] (see figure,  right).  PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854908],  
particularly among  the predicted  "sensitive"  subgroups.  
 
The implications of these preliminary findings are potentially quite significant, as they suggest that MEM  
might enhance PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67127], particularly among  subgroups of individuals carrying "biomarkers" that  
include low baseline PPI, high novelty seeking, and/or the Val/Val COMT genotype. If this same pattern of  
results is detected in clinical popu lations, it will suggest a means to prospectively identify patients in whom  
memantine  (or other putative pro -cognitive  agents) can enhance  specific neurocognitive abilities (e.g.  
WM) to synergize with therapeutic interventions (e.g. cognitive training) tha t rely on these abilities.   We  
are currently planning to test this prediction in clinical populations, including patients with schizophrenia,  
who are enrolled  in IRB-approved  clinical  trials  of cognitive  training.  
 
Summary  of Progress  to Date  
 
A. Drug  Effects  on Prepulse  Inhibition  of Startle:  
 
1. We carefully examined the effects of 4 dopamine agonists (amphetamine, 20 mg), bromocriptine, 1.25  
mg), pramipexole  (0.125  and 0.175  mg) and amantadine,  200 mg) and one NMDA  antagonist  
(memantine, 20 and 30 mg) on prepulse inhibition (PPI) and related measures, and reported on these  
effects in five papers (below). Paradigms were modified to increase the sensitivity to drug effects (e.g. via  
use of within -subject designs or optimal stimul us parameters), and new paradigms were developed to  
provide  new insights  into these  drug effects  (e.g. via the development  of a novel  sensory  gating  
paradigm). Our findings identified quite distinct effects of these drugs in our behavioral paradigms; for  
example,  amphetamine  on the one hand,  and amantadine  and memantine  on the other,  produced  
opposite  effects  on PPI, with amphetamine  significantly  disrupting  and amantadine  and memantine  
significantly increasing PPI. These effects were not pr edicted based on our preclinical findings in rats, and  
have  led to new hypotheses  and insights  related  to cross -species  differences  in the regulation  of 
sensorimotor  gating.  
 
2. We studied  the effects  of an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_114964]  (Seroquel)  on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854909], the first of its kind in the literature. Seroquel (12.5 mg) was used without any adverse  
effects  on normal  males.  This initial  study  helped  us design  our current,  ongoing  experiments,  examining  
 
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_1190492]  recently  detected  pro-cognitive  (WM)  effects  of memantine  (20 mg) among  normal  controls  
who also exhibit  PPI-enhancing  effects  of this drug (see above).  
 
B. Paradigm  development  
 
Studies led to the development and optimization of two paradigms: a) a within -subject latent inhibition (LI)  
paradigm that was studied both in normal controls treated wi th DA agonists, and in normal control vs.  
schizophrenia subjects. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a within -subject LI paradigm suitable for human use has been a  
longstanding  goal of our psychophysiology  program.  
 
C. Relationship  of physiological  and personality measures  to startle  gating  in normal  subjects  
 
As part of our ongoing process of screening normal control subjects for drug studies, we have collected  
data from large samples (current n > 400), adequate for examining relationships between sensorimotor  
gating and normal physiological and personality markers, as well as factors such as ethnicity, that may  
ultimately be relevant to genetic studies with PPI. These studies have led to several interesting findings,  
including an inverse relationship between restin g blink rate (a physiological variable related to central DA  
function) and PPI, as well as robust ethnic differences in startle magnitude (but not sensorimotor gating)  
between  Caucasian  and Asian  American  populations.  
 
We have had no adverse reactions associated with drug ingestion in any of our testing , including tests  
completed with DA agonists, Seroquel, or drug combinations. Nausea previously experienced by a small  
number of test subjects after pergolide was reported in a previous IRB upda te; we have not since used  
pergolide in any studies. One brief syncopal epi[INVESTIGATOR_854910], but had  
no long -term sequellae. The DA agonists used for the majority of the studies during this period were  
amphetamine and amantadin e, which are very well tolerated. Seroquel results  in mild sedation, but  
subjects  remain  quite  comfortable.  All other  drugs,  experimental  measures,  testing  procedures,  etc. 
proposed  for studies in  this application  have  already received  UCSD  IRB approval in  Project  #031317.  
 
Several  modifications  to the protocol  have  been  approved  and incorporated  into the protocol.

9. RESEARCH  DESIGN  AND  METHODS  
GENERAL  METHODS:  
 
a) Study  populations:  Study  subjects,  ages  18-45, are recruited  from the community.  Two subject  
populations are recruited: clinically normal control subjects, and patients with schizophrenia. The patient  
populations and upper age limit of 45 are used only for studies with memantine, which is prescr ibed 
clinically in geriatric populations for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. For all other studies, the sample  
is limited  to clinically  normal controls and  the upper  age limit is 35. 
 
b) We ask new participants whether they would allow us to contact [CONTACT_67174].  If they  
agree,  our plan is to contact  [CONTACT_854934] a future  date for appropriate  IRB approved  studies.  
 
c) For all drug evaluation studies, normal control subjects are recruited and screened for evidence of  
physical  or psychological  impairment;  schizophrenia  patients  are recruited  and screened  only for 
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_1190493]’s performance  may be  
monitored by [CONTACT_2224] a non -recording camera.  This is to ensure that the subject is awake and  
performing the task as instructed.  Only the investigator running the test session will be able to see the  
subject,  and this allows  quantification  of blink rate. 
 
d) Subject payment (also see below, section 18): For subjects participating in the “Within -Subject” test  
sessions, payment will be divided in the following schedule: on completion of screening day: $30; on  
completion of first TEST SESSION day: $100;  On completion of second TEST SESSION day: $130.  This 
payment schedule provides appropriate incentive for the subjects to return for the second test day. This is  
to ensure that subjects return for the second and third test days.  If subjects fail screening criteria for  
recreational drug use prior to any TEST SESSION day, they will not be tested further and will not be paid  
for that test day. We will recommend that subjects remain in our laboratory for monitoring until six and one  
half hours after p ill ingestion.  Should they choose to leave our facility for any reason prior to that time, it  
will be at their own risk.  Their involvement in the study will be completed and payment on the Test  
Session  day will be  prorated  to $16 per hour.  
 
e) Venopuncture: Venopuncture for COMT allelic testing in some subjects will occur during the initial visit,  
before or after what normally is titled the SCREENING SESSION in the studies listed below. A single  
venopuncture performed by [CONTACT_854935]/CTRI or  Blood  
Drawing Station will be used to 10 cc of blood for COMT allelic testing. Based on specific needs of the  
experimental design (e.g. equal number of Met/Met, Val/Met and Val/Val allelic carriers, or subgroups of  
"high" vs. "low" PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67132], based on the upper vs. lower quartile of a normal population distribution),  
subjects may be asked to come back for further testing, if they indicate they would like to do so.  If 
participants continue to the remainder of the st udy, there will be [ADDRESS_1190494] days, one of which will involve  
placebo, and the other day involving an active dose of amphetamine (20 mg), memantine (20 mg) or other  
approved test drug/dose. The TEST SESSIONS will mimic those in the WITHIN -SUBJECT model below;  
however,  venopuncture  occurs  only during  the first visit. 
 
f) Clinical assessment: Specific clinical assessment tools used in control and schizophrenia subjects are  
described  in Section  10. 
 
g) Test schedules:  
 
1. The "WITHIN -SUBJECT" study involves a single drug.  There will be [ADDRESS_1190495] days – on the additional test  
day, subjects will receive either placebo or an active dose of one of the following: amphetamine (20 mg),  
memantine (10 mg) and memantine (20 mg). Some studies may require a venopuncture for g enetic  
analysis as  discussed  above.  A "model"  example  of a WITHIN -SUBJECT test  schedule  is shown  below:

Subjects will be instructed to not eat on the morning of the test, and instead will be served a standardized  
meal [ADDRESS_1190500] on drug  
absorption.  
 
Vital sign assessment during and after testing will be performed in lying, sitting and standing positi ons, by  
a trained researcher or health professional. Sessions will be discontinued for 55>HR>110, 90> SBP>160,  
45>DBP>95, emesis, severe discomfort or other unanticipated medical or psychological consequence. At  
the end of testing,  at the times  described  above,  subjects  will be dismissed  if their heart  rate is between  
55 - 90, their SBP is between 90 -150, their DBP is between 45 - 90, and there is no evidence of dizziness  
or significant heart rate increase or blood pressure reduction on postural changes, from lying to sitting to  
standing.  
 
2. The "ONE -DAY" test session: When developi[INVESTIGATOR_67133], we often examine correlations  
between response characteristics elicited by [CONTACT_67177]. The subjects participating  
these types of studies will be tested with air puff and all acoustic stimuli. Acoustic stimuli will be no louder  
than 118 dB(A), a level already approved in previous protocols (most recently 071154). No drugs are  
administered  during  these  studies.  
 
These studies will include up to [ADDRESS_1190501] the different  
possible  tests  listed.  The options  are: 
 
1. A urine test will be required to test for the presence of illicit drug use.  Your study participation will be terminated if  
the urine test  is positive for any drugs,  and you will be paid for your time,  which will be prorated as stated below.  
Only the researcher  will know  the re sults of the test. This procedure  takes  approximately  10 minutes.  
2. You will be asked to fill out several personality questionnaires.  You can skip any questions you do not  
want  to answer.  This procedure  takes  approximately  30 minutes.  
3. You will be a given a psychiatric examination that includes medical, psychiatric, social and drug  
histories.  This procedure  takes  approximately  20 minutes.  
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page 11  4. Eyeblink  startle:  two electrodes  with adhesive  backing  will be placed  next to both eyes  so that your 
blink reflex can be measured, and one will be placed behind the left ear as a reference measure. This  
procedure  takes  approximately  10 minutes.  The procedures  listed  below  may occur  concurrently.  
5. You will  be asked  to complete  one or more  computer  task(s), each  approximately  15 to 20 minutes.  
6. You will be asked to listen to a series of brief tones, experience a series of air puffs under your chin,  
and/or experience a series of brief vibrations delivered via speaker to your hand for approxima tely 25  
minutes.  Some of the tones will be so loud that you might find them annoying or uncomfortable.  Some  
puffs and  vibrations  might  be so strong  that you might  be surprised.  
7. You will be  asked  to make  marks  on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_854911].  
8. You will be asked  to evaluate  your present  mood  state  in a questionnaire.  
9. You will be asked to make a mark on a line to indicate how loud a sound seems to you with a pencil, or  
by [CONTACT_2329] a computerized rating scale called the "slider" that has a knob  on its surface. Movement of the  
knob  corresponds  to movement  on a computer  screen,  which  will sit in front of you. 
 
The participant will be informed over the phone that some or all or the options may not be used, and will  
not be a part of the procedure.  
 
h. Information  pertaining  to specific  pharmacologic  agents  to be used  in these  studies:  
 
Proposed list of pharmacolog ic agents and doses (doses based on previous human studies with these  
agents, or the  lowest dose  initiated in  standard treatment algorithms, as described by [CONTACT_67178]’s  
Desk  Reference):  
 
Drug  Route     Doses  “Common”  side effects  (single  dose)*  
Amphetamine  Oral       20 mg Increased HR, BP, restlessness, dizziness, euphoria  
Memantine  Oral       10, 20 mg Dizziness,  restlessness,  nausea,  headache  
 
• most reports define “common” to either mean >5% incidence or >10% incidence; most side effects  
report ed only with continued use or repeated dosing, rather than single dose use, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_854912], or in vulnerable clinical  
populations (e.g. elderly patients with dementia); in several cas es, these effects were observed at  
rates  that were  not statistically  different  from placebo.  
 
The dose of amphetamine used in this study (20 mg po) is one that is used commonly in healthy adult  
subjects. References are provided below for examples of studie s in which this dose has been used,  
without untoward effects; two papers from our studies are included among these. Subjects in our studies  
are [ADDRESS_1190502] double blind study. No subjects r eported adverse effects of this dose of  
amphetamine. Measures of autonomic function indicated the expected increases in heart rate and blood  
pressure  after amphetamine,  as indicated  below.  However,  in each  case,  these  increases  were  
numerically  small  (see Table  1) and did not approach  levels  that would  normally  be of medical  
consequence  in a healthy  young  adult  population.  Only one subject  exhibited  a heart  rate with 
amphetamine  in excess  of 100; several  placebo  subjects  exhibited  heart  rates  in the 90's.

Subjective ratings also demonstrated no adverse effects of this drug dose, based on visual analog scale  
(VAS) self -assessments (Table 2).  In these scales, 0 = n o effect, 100 = extreme effect. Other scales  
indicated that this dose of d -amphetamine reduced drowsiness, and was associated with a trend towards  
an increased  sense  of being  "happy".

Summary: A 20 mg po dose of amphetamine is used commonly in the published literature in studies of  
normal, healthy adults, without  common adverse  reactions. This experience  is validated  in our own  
studies  of 65 normal adult  subjects.

Memantine  is the only drug in this application  that is being  proposed  for testing  in schizophrenia  patients.  
It is FDA -approved for the treatment  of dementia,  but has been  widely used  in a number of  different  
clinical  conditions  (see below).  
 
Memantine,  Basic  Information:  The NMDA  receptor  is a ligand -gated  ion channel,  permeable  to 
monovalent and divalent ions. Activation of NMDA receptors leads to Ca++ influx, which is blocked by  
[CONTACT_67179]. High affinity channel blockers, like PCP, are not easily studied in man, due to  
side effects  such  as psychosis  and neurotoxicity.  However,  low affinity  channel  blockers  are used  
clinically, and are well tolerated, with potential neuroprotective properties. Several lower affinity NMDA  
antagonists reduce long -interval PPI, though this effect is generally weaker than that caused by [CONTACT_854936]. Wiley et al. reported PPI -disruptive effects of dextromethorphan and memantine; the  
effects of memantine were dose -related, reaching significance at 10 mg/kg  (an effect that we have  
replicated ), while those of dextromethorphan were evident only at the highest dose (100 mg/kg). At these  
doses, neither drug altered startle magnitude, while a lower affinity NMDA antagonist, ibogaine, reduced  
PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67136]. In this report, amantadine did not alter PPI [INVESTIGATOR_136] a dose  
(56 mg/kg) lower than the one we have found to reduce long interval PPI, and to increase short interval  
PPI (100 mg/kg).  
 
Memantine, Clinical Information: Memantine has been prescribed in Europe for >  15 years for dementia,  
with formal EU marketing approval. Published studies document safety and high tolerability in >1000  
elderly patients with dementia, and tolerability of doses 2 -4X above typi[INVESTIGATOR_67137],  
younger adults, who repor ted no adverse effects at a dose of 40 mg po. The active dose in the present  
proposal (20 mg po) is one -half the dose found to be well -tolerated in studies in these younger male  
subjects. Studies have reported no neuropsychological changes or mood changes after administration of  
20-40 mg memantine po in healthy young men, and only a short -lasting sensation of restlessness and  
dizziness in 4 out of 7 healthy young adults, 2 hours after administration of 30 mg memantine po. Other  
studies  using  intravenous loa ding of memantine  in healthy  young  adults  reported  no side effects.  
 
Memantine was developed for many clinical indications (e.g. dementia, neuropathic pain and diabetic  
neuropathy).  Full FDA approval  was received  10/17/03.  Since  its approval,  memantine  has been  
prescribed widely, both for its FDA indication of mild -to-moderate dementia, and off -label, for more severe  
dementia,  and for other  conditions,  including  diabetic  neuropathy.  Data  continue  to support  its excellent  
safety  profile;  a recent  study  reported  in JAMA  with > 200 subjects  treated  daily with 20 mg memantine  
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page 13  resulted in fewer treatment discontinuations due to adverse events for memantine (7.4%) than for placebo  
(12.4%). Memantine is prescribed routinely for pa tients at the UCSD Medical Center Senior Behavioral  
Health  Unit; these patients are studied  in the PI's protocol before and after initiation of memantine  
therapy. Thus, in essence, the current request for an amended protocol will extend our existing studie s in 
elderly,  medically  complex  patients  to include  healthy,  younger,  normal  control subjects.  
 
Based on our published and unpublished findings to date, we have studied memantine in a full placebo - 
controlled double -blind cross -over design in 45 clinically normal individuals. Data from 37 subjects was  
reported in a published paper (20 mg, n = 19; 30 mg, n = 18), and data from 8 addition subjects (20 mg)  
was recently submitted as an abstract for the upcoming 2010 meeting of the Society for Neurosci ence. No  
AEs were  detected  with any subjects  in these  studies.  
 
The present protocol proposes the use of 10 and 20 mg memantine; our experience to date is limited to  
the higher of these two doses (20 mg); based on the published literature, we expect any po tential AEs to  
be dose -dependent, and thus the 20 mg dose (vs. the 10 mg dose) represents the one with the highest  
likelihood of AEs, should any occur. In our published data (n=19), the only detectable impact of 20 mg  
memantine (other than those in our neu rophysiological measures) were: 1) an increase in self -reported  
level of happi[INVESTIGATOR_008] 30 –230 min after pi[INVESTIGATOR_67138]; and 2) a small decrease in spontaneous blink rate,  
an effect generally suggestive of reduced fatigue or somnolence. No significant chan ges in self -rated  
dizziness, queasiness or drowsiness were detected at any time after 20 mg memantine. Autonomic  
measures  (heart  rate, systolic  or diastolic  blood  pressure)  were  also not significantly  changed  by 
[CONTACT_67181].  Our unpublished  data (n=8) with  20 mg memantine  (see above),  confirms  all of these  
findings, including no significant change in autonomic measures or self -rated dizziness, queasiness or  
drowsiness, a trend towards increased self -rated happi[INVESTIGATOR_67139]. In addition, as  
described above,  we noted a significant  increase in  working  memory after memantine, as measured by  
[CONTACT_67182].  
 
Memantine has been studied in schizophrenia patients. It is important to note that these studies involved  
daily dosing for many weeks or longer, wh ile the present protocol proposes only a single active dose of  
memantine.  Nonetheless,  the findings  are informative:  
 
Memantine use in schizophrenia patients: A recent double -blind study reported large reductions in positive  
and negative symptoms (d=1.38 -3.33) and improved Mini -Mental State Exam scores after 12 weeks of  
memantine (20 mg/d; n=10) vs. placebo (PBO; n=11) added to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]; so significant adverse events  
were  reported.  An earlier 8 -week double -blind,  study of  memantine  (20 mg/d;  n=70) vs. PBO  (n=68)  
added to atypi[INVESTIGATOR_854913], but found that memantine was associated with more adverse events  
(AEs; memantine vs. PBO = 8.7% vs. 6.0%) and treatment discontinuation due to AEs (11.6% vs. 3.0%).  
Importantly,  the most  frequent  serious  AE in memantine  group  patients  was an exacerbation  of 
schizophrenia symptoms, but this AE actually occurred LESS OFTEN in the  memantine group (2.9%)  
than in the p lacebo group (6.0%). Overall, the incidence of ANY adverse events over the 8 week trial was  
92.4% in the placebo group vs. 88.3% in the memantine group; no changes in autonomic measures, EKG,  
laboratory measures or extrapyramidal functions were detected wi th memantine. A smaller, 6 -week, open  
label study of memantine (5 - 20 mg/d) in symptomatic schizophrenia inpatients reported a significant  
improvement in positive and negative symptoms but not cognitive performance, with no AEs. Three case  
reports describ ed beneficial effects of memantine (5 - 10 mg/d) in schizophrenia patients, with reductions  
in negative symptoms and functional impairment and no AEs; in two reports, symptoms returned on  
memantine  discontinuation  and resolved  again  after restarting  memant ine. 
 
All drugs/doses proposed in this application (for amphetamine and memantine) are equal to or lower than  
those  already  approved  by [CONTACT_854937]'s laboratory  for several  years  in > [ADDRESS_1190504] recommended  
starting  dose  of a given  medication  when  it is used  in a clinical  setting,  and well below  the typi[INVESTIGATOR_854914] 14  maintenance dose  of these  medications.  
 
Drugs will be dispensed by a licensed physician, and a licensed physician will be present on the premises  
at all times  during  testing.  
 
No drugs will be used in studies with subjects < [ADDRESS_1190505] been used safely in 18 -35 year old subjects (or, in the case of memantine, 18 - 
45 year old subjects). Although dopamine agonists have primarily been used and tested in Parkinsonian  
patients,  some  of these  dopamine  agonists are  used  in children.  Amphetamine  is used  safely  and 
effectively in children with Attention Deficit Disorder. The only drug in this proposal that does not have a  
specific  indications  or common  use in adolescents  is memantine.  We have  published  findings  of 
memantine's safe use in [ADDRESS_1190506] often used in patients with multi -system medical illness (Alzheimer's Disease) accounts for some of  
its rare  but more  significant  side effects  (e.g. hallucinosis).  
 
i. Laboratory  Measures:  
 
1. Startle Reflex: The startle reflex will be measured in control populations in men and women to examine  
sex differences in the startle -facilitating and inhibiting effects of weak and strong prepulses presented at  
short and long prepulse intervals. Sex differences in prepulse modulation of startle also will be measured  
using cross -modal stimuli (acoustic prep ulse and tactile pulse).  Sensorimotor inhibition and facilitation will  
be measured  in women  during  different  phases  of the menstrual cycle.  
 
Testing occurs during the light circadian phase (0900 -1700). The testing room is maintained at 68 -70° F.  
Subjects a re screened for hearing impairment with a Saico Audiometer at .5, 1 and 6K Hz; impairment at  
40 dB(A)  leads  to exclusion.  Startle  is measured  with an SR-LAB IBM PC computer  monitoring  system  
and a custom EMG amplifier with a 1K Hz band pass filter. Subjects sit in a quiet room, with 2 Beckman  
miniature Ag -AgCl electrodes placed 1 cm lateral and inferior to the right and/or left external canthus, over  
the orbicularis oculi (R< 5K Ohm). A ground electrode is placed behind the left ear, over the mastoid . 
Subjects wear Telephonics headphones (TDH -39-P) and look forward to a point that allows them to be  
comfortable with their eyes open. A 5 -min 70 dB (A) background white noise is followed by [CONTACT_854938].  The startle pulse is either a 118 dB(A) [ADDRESS_1190507] (P -ALONE) or a comparably  
startling air puff stimulus presented alone or during prepulse trials, preceded at a 100 msec interval by a  
prepulse ([ADDRESS_1190508] a few dBs above background).  Background white noise is conti nuous until  
the session ends.  The session lasts about 25 minutes with repeated trials and an intertrial interval of 30  
seconds.  
 
Digitized blink responses are displayed graphically on the PC monitor; voluntary and spontaneous blinks  
are excluded based on p ublished criteria. Startle reactivity is defined by P -ALONE amplitude. A small  
number of subjects are startle "non -responders": following criteria previously established, subjects whose  
startle amplitude does not exceed set levels are excluded from analysi s of PPI (non -responder mean  
amplitude  <10 units  on P-ALONE,  compared  to typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] "responder"  mean  of 75 units).  
 
Tactile stimuli: In some studies, the subject rests their hand on a sound speaker that delivers a vibration to  
the thenar eminence of the dominant hand, followed 60 -240 ms later either by 40 psi 40 ms air puff  
presented  to the sternal notch  or an acoustic  118 dB(A)  or 105 dB(A)  [ADDRESS_1190509].  
 
2. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and processing: EEG measures will be acquired using  
methods identical to those approved by [CONTACT_67185] (#071128, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Greg  
Light), using a Neuroscan NuAmps system (Neuroscan Labs, El Paso, Tx).  The EEG will be recorded  
from the scalp  through  34 sintered  Ag/AgCl  electrodes  using  an electrode  cap (EasyCap,  Falk Minow  
Services).  Electrodes placed at the tip of the nose and at Fpz will serve as the reference and ground,  
respectively.  Four additional  electrodes  placed  above  and below  the left eye and at the outer  canthi  of 
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page 15  both eyes will be used for monitoring blinks and eye movements.  All impedances are kept below 4 kΩ.  
Signals will be digitized at a rate of 1 kHz with system acquisition filter settings at 0.5-100 Hz.  Auditory  
stimuli will be presented to subjects using foam insert earphones (Model 3A, Aearo Auditory Systems).  
EEG and stimulus markers will be recorded continuously.  Subjects will not smoke for at least [ADDRESS_1190510] mirror.  In addition, signal quality  
and the number of sweeps free of gross artifacts (defined as ±100 μV across  the 0 to 512 msec following  
stimuli)  will be closely  monitored.  Data  processing  will be performed  offline  and blind  to group  
membership using automated procedures.  First, continuous recordings will be mathematically corrected  
for eye movement artifacts us ing established methods.  Continuous data will be epoched relative to the  
onset of stimuli and centered at the mean of the prestimulus baseline.  Following blink correction, epochs  
containing > ±[ADDRESS_1190511] EEG  
segments with other artifacts (e.g., muscle activity).  EEG testing, including electrode setup and running  
the two paradigms  (MMN and  gamma  band  entrainment)  takes  approximately  60 minutes.  
 
Mismatch  Negativity  (MMN):  Stimulation,  recording,  and analysis  techniques  for calculating  MMN  
amplitude will follow our previously established methods. Briefly, Subjects will be presented with binaural  
stimulation ([ADDRESS_1190512] stimuli, 85 dB[A] SPL, 1 msec rise/fall) with a fixed  
stimulus  onset -to-onset asynchrony  of [ADDRESS_1190513]  (P=0.90; 50  msec  duration) and  
deviant (P=0.10; 100 msec duration) stimuli will be presented to subjects in pseudorandom order while  
they watch a silent video.  Signals  will be digitized at a rate of [ADDRESS_1190514]  
tones from the ERPs generated in response to the deviant tones.  The MMN amplit ude will be measured  
as the mean voltage from 135 to 205 milliseconds.  Primary dependent measure : MMN amplitude at  
electrode  Fz. 
 
Gamma Band Entrainment (neural network synchronization to sensory stimuli): Evoked EEG power and  
inter-trial coherence analyses  will be assessed in  response to 20,  30, and 40 -Hz stimulation at  Fz 
following our published methods, as this is the electrode with maximal responses.  The stimuli will be 1 - 
millisecond duration, 93 dB clicks presented in 500 msec trains varying in rate of presentation (20, 30, and  
40 Hz) in each of 3 blocks (order fixed). Blocks contain [ADDRESS_1190515] -free epochs in each  
block and digitally  filtered  using a  zero-phase shift,  10-60 Hz bandpass  filter (24 dB/octave).  The 
averaged epochs across the click trains (0 -512 msec) will then be transformed into power spectra by  
[CONTACT_67186] (FFT) using a bin width o f 1.95 Hz for the assessment of evoked power  
analyses. The 20, 30, and 40 -Hz power spectra will be averaged across 10 Hz bands from 15 -25 Hz, 26 - 
35 Hz, and 36 -45 Hz, respectively.  Time/frequency ITC analyses will be performed using EEGLab  in 
order to asse ss ITC of the stimulus -driven EEG signals.  ITC provides an estimation of the strength of  
phase locking of the EEG signals across individual trials independent of the signal amplitude.  In this  
analysis, a parameter is obtained that ranges from 0 (for non -phase locked, random activity) to 1 (for  
activity that is fully locked in phase across individual trials at a given latency).  Considered together, the  
evoked power and ITC provide a conceptual framework for observing the event -related brain dynamics  
that occur consistently across both blocks of time and individual trials.   Primary dependent measure : [ADDRESS_1190516] of the  MATRICS  Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), which  
includes ten tests that  assess seven cognitive domains. The MATRICS battery was developed by [CONTACT_854939].  
We are already using the MCCB for this purpose as approved in this protocol  for control subjects, and will  
now also administer it to psychiatric patients. We previously used the MCCB for this purpose in another  
UCSD  IRB-approved  protocol (#071824).  The battery  takes  about  1 hour to complete.  
 
4. Visuospatial priming: The subject's t ask is to press one of four computer keys, which correspond  
spatially  to four loci on  a PC screen.  Each  trial includes  two successive  displays,  each  consisting  of a brief 
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page 16  presentation of an 'X' and an 'O' in two of the four locations. On each presentation, subjects press the key  
corresponding to the location of the target letter 'O' while ignoring the distractor letter 'X'. The 'X' and 'O'  
within each display are visible for 150 msec; the time between displays is 350 msec. Th e task consists of  
50 display pairs.  There is a baseline condition in which the positions of the target ('O') and non -target ('X')  
in the probe display are unrelated to their positions in the prime display.  In "repetition priming" (the  
facilitation conditi on) the position of the target remains the same on the successive displays.  In "negative  
priming" (the inhibition condition) the target in the probe display appears in the location where the non - 
target  had previously  been.  
 
5. Latent Inhibition:  A compute rized visual latent inhibition task is used.  Subjects are pre -exposed or  non-
preexposed to a visual stimulus (pattern on a computer screen) that will, in the subsequent phase of  the 
testing, have predictive value.  Using the computer keyboard for responding  the subjects will predict  
computer screen changes, being influenced by [CONTACT_67188]. Each phase requires [ADDRESS_1190517]: The pregnancy  test is  able to detect tiny amounts  of the pregnancy hormone hCG  
(Human  Chorionic  Gonadotropin)  in urine.  This hormone  is produced  in increasing  amounts  during  the 
first part of pregnancy.  HCG will be measured by a urine “dip -stick” (“Surecheck Early Pregnancy Test”).  
This test  is a midstream  format  test for the detection  of the pregnancy  hormone  in urine.  
 
j. Statistics: Tests for homogeneity of variance are performed, and if appropriate, analyses of variance  
(ANOVA) used.  Statview/Superanova software is used on the Macintosh. For startle data, P -Alone  
amplitude, PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67142]; for drug studies, drug dose is used as a  
within -subject factor. Habituation is detected by a significant effect of trial block. Visuospatial priming is  
analyzed  separately for baseline,  facilitation, and  inhibition conditions using  ANOVAs.  Baseline  is a 
measure  of visuospatial  response  time,  while  facilitation  and inhibition  scores  are measures  of 
sensorimotor modulation. Nonparametric statistics are used for the Latent Inhibition analyses because  
data from this test tend toward a bimodal distribution.  A rank sum factorial analysis is used for the data.  
Other  dependent  measures  will be analyzed  with parametric  or non-parametric  analyses,  generally  
consisting of mixed design ANOVAs, as appropriate. Following a significant ANOVA, specific comparisons  
are made  using  Tukey's  tests.  Alpha  is 0.05.  
 
Power considerations: Sample sizes vary across the different studies, based on issues ranging from the  
study design and goals to empi[INVESTIGATOR_67143]. For  
example, "ONE -DAY" studies are designed to identify and "pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]" optimal stimulus parameters for testing  
specific hypotheses, and these studies may not be powered to achieve traditional levels of statistical  
significance. On the other hand, designing studies of drug effects on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854915].  
For example, to assess the effects of memantine on "gating" measures in schizophrenia patients, the  
primary measure will be evaluated by [ADDRESS_1190518] of dose (active > PBO) or significant dose x  
interval (int) interaction and post -hoc comparisons at one or more prep ulse intervals. Existing data (see  
above) provide a strong a priori prediction that the [ADDRESS_1190519] size (d) for PPI -enhancement by 20 mg memantine in HCS was  
0.91;  with a similar “d” in patients,  30 patients/dose  yields  power  of 0.[ADDRESS_1190520]  the predicted  
memantine effects; with maximum expected attrition (n=24), power is 0.85. Past findings also lead to the  
prediction that these MEM effects would be most robust in subjects exhibiting the lowest basal PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67132]  
(d=1.80). Using a median split of mean basal (screening) PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67132], ANOVA as above will detect a  
significant interaction of memantine dose x basal PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67147], or dose x basal level x int, and significant  
post-hoc comp arisons at one or more prepulse intervals (again, [ADDRESS_1190521] a priori  
candidate). Given the published “d” in control subjects, a comparable “d” in the proposed 12 -15 “low PPI”  
patients/dose  group  would  yield power  >0.[ADDRESS_1190522]  of basal  PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854916],  we hypothesize  that 
a critical  moderating  factor  underlying  PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854917]158Met  genotype;  
specifically, we predict that “Val/Val” individuals will be most sensitive to memantine -enhanced PPI. This  
will be tested in two ways: first, by [CONTACT_67189], with COMT status as a between -subject factor, and  
memantine  dose  and prepulse  interval  as within-subject  factors.  Significant  genotype  x dose  or genotype  
x dose x int interactions, with appropriate post -hoc comparisons, would confirm the hypothesis. Estimating  
d=1.53, based on the mean “d” of two “COMT phenotypes” in controls  – low basal PPI (d=1.80 ) and high  
“novelty seeking” personality (d=1.27) - the proposed 11 Val/Val and 7 Met/Met patients/dose group would  
yield power of 0.[ADDRESS_1190523] genotype -sensitive memantine effects. It is possible that various factors  
(including a skewed distribution of allele frequencies, or substantial genotype effects on basal PPI [INVESTIGATOR_67132])  
might preclude detection of a significant [ADDRESS_1190524] interaction. A secondary (albeit weaker) test of the  
hypothesis will utilize separate ANOVAs in Val/Val vs. Met/Met subgroups, wi th predicted PPI -enhancing  
effects of memantine in the Val/Val but not Met/Met subgroups. Previous reports also predict a significant  
main  effect  of genotype,  with PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854918]/Met>Val/Met>Val/Val  gradient.  Logistic  
regressions might be used, with genotype coded to reflect “dose” of the Met allele (Val/Val=0, Val/Met=1,  
and Met/Met=2), to assess the distribution of the neurophysiological and neurocognitive measures. All  
analyses will be conducted independently for each dose group. If comp arable effects are evident with 10  
and 20 mg doses, dose groups may be pooled to increase power for exploratory analyses (e.g. to detect  
genotype  x drug effects).  
Main effects of memantine on WM will be tested by [CONTACT_31806] -way ANOVA with memantine dose as a with in- 
factor. Based on d=0.73 for increased WM after 20 mg MEM in controls (see above), the proposed 30  
patients/dose  group  would  yield power  of 0.[ADDRESS_1190525] some differential (Val/Val > Met/Met) memantine sensitivity in this measure. If  
we estimate effects of COMT status on WM memantine -sensitivity to be  comparable  to those for PPI  
(65% increase in effect size), then the estimated d for Val/Val vs. Met/Met sensitivity should be 1.20, and  
the proposed genotype subgroup sizes would yield power of  0.[ADDRESS_1190526] genotype -sensitive memantine  
effects  on WM. 
Secondary “biomarkers” are MMN and GBS. For MMN, positive memantine effects will be detected by  
[CONTACT_67190]. For GBS, positive memantine effects would be detected by  
[CONTACT_67191] 40 Hz evoked power at electrode Fz. Unlike those for PPI, predictions of positive memantine  
effects on MMN and GBS are not based directly on previous findings from our laboratory, using measures  
identical to those proposed herein. However, based on reports in healthy subjects from other laboratories  
of memantine  effects  on MMN  (d=0.87)  and ketamine  effects  on GBS  (d=0.69),  the proposed  30 
patients/dose group would yield power of 0.[ADDRESS_1190527]  exclusion  criteria  are serious  medical  or neurologic  illness,  history  of seizures,  
sustained  loss of consciousness,  substance  abuse/dependence  or pregnancy.  
 
The drug evaluation  studies  will include  normal  subjects and  individuals with  existing  diagnoses  of 
schizophrenia.  They will range in age from 18 -35 years for all studies except those involving memantine,  
in which case they will range from 18 -45 years.  Males and females will be included in future studies.  
Subjects will be given a complete screening physi cal exam and will be excluded if showing any evidence  
of cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension, arrhythmia). Control subjects will also be screened for  
evidence of psychopathology or history of substance abuse using a modified SCID -N interview.  If either is  
evident, the subject will be excluded from the study.   All subjects will be informed of the nature of the  
study by  a research  assistant  who will obtain  consent  if the subject  wishes  to participate.  All subjects  will 
be mentally  competent  and capable  of giving  informed  consent.

The proposed study samples (Table 3) reflect both logistical and p ower consideration (see above, section  
"8. j. Statistics.") that differ across the several different studies covered by [CONTACT_67192]. Testing in the  
"ONE -DAY" session is designed for parametric "mini -studies", and the proposed sample of "up to 50  
subje cts" per year will allow us to study up to 5 different sets of stimulus parameters, with n's of [ADDRESS_1190528]  
historically been 20 -30 subjects per dose; however, with  the addition of COMT subgroup analyses, we  
currently  plan to test [ADDRESS_1190529]  amphetamine  study,  over a 2 year period  
(n=60/year).  To study  the effects  of memantine  on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_854919],  
we are proposing to study a total of 60 subjects: 30 per dose (10 and 20 mg). As this testing will be  
conducted over [ADDRESS_1190530] 5 years  (as we’ve  only studied  males  exclusively  
based  on drug study  exclusion  criteria)  and is expected  in the following  years  are: 
Asian/Pacific  Islander  29%

11. RECRUITMENT  
1) Control subjects:  Recruitment  of clinically normal control subjects  will follow our established  and 
successful  methods,  using  public  announcements  (e.g.,  newspapers  and bulletin  boards,  online  
advertisements).  Fliers that are posted and faxes that are sent to the UCSD Guardian (on -campus  
newspaper)  are enclosed.  Phone  screening  excludes  subjects  with a history  of serious  medical  or 
neurologic illness or trauma, mental illness (including substance abuse), psychotropic medication use,  
known  or suspected  pregnancy  or hearing  problems.  Screening  is repeated  at the time of testing,  and a 
urine sample is colle cted for toxicological analysis (exclusion for illicit substances). The SCID is used with  
our published  criteria  to exclude  theoretically   “psychosis -prone”  control  subjects,   important  for 
 
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page 19  comparisons with schizophrenia patients. A handedness questionnaire is used to distinguish right and left  
handed  subjects  and a questionnaire  for evaluating  sexual  preference  is used  to identify  gender  
orientation, an important control in studies of sexual  dimorphism of sensorimotor gating.  Subjects also fill  
out cognitive  and personality  questionnaires:  the Eysenck  Personality  Questionnaire  (EPQ),  
Tridimensional  Personality Questionnaire  (TPQ),  the Sensation  Seeking  Scale  - Form  V (SSS -V). 
 
2) Schizophrenia  patients:  Recruitment  of schizophrenia  subjects  will follow  our established  and 
successful  methods.  Patients  will be recruited  from the UCSD  Outpatient  Clinic,  the UCSD  VAMC  clinics  
or community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and board and care facilities. Clinical assessment of schizophrenia patients  
follows our established procedures approved by [CONTACT_67193] (e.g. #071128, [CONTACT_854949], PI; #071306, [CONTACT_67211], PI). Specifically, after giving informed consent , some  
schizophrenia patients will be interviewed using the SCID -I/P to ensure that they meet the DSM -IV criteria  
for schizophrenia. Demographic information, including age, age of onset, duration of illness, number and  
duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], socioec onomic status, education, a detailed medication history, medical and  
psychiatric history, and family history of schizophrenia disorders will be obtained. Positive and negative  
symptoms  of schizophrenia  will be assessed  during  the Schedule  for the Assessmen t of Positive  
Symptoms (SAPS) and Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Inclusion criteria  
include: 1) DSM -IV diagnosis of schizophrenia; 2) Written informed consent to participate in the study; 3)  
Age > 18; 4) Absence of dementia or men tal retardation; 5) Urine toxicology negative for recreational  
drugs; 6) Fluent and literate in English (needed for completion of MCCB). Exclusion criteria include: a)  
meets DSM -IV criteria for current substance abuse or dependence and has been substance a bstinent for  
less than 30 days; b) a history of traumatic brain injury; c) auditory or visual impairments severe enough to  
prevent  study  participation.  
 
Recruitment of female subjects:  As per NIH guidelines, it is important to establish whether observed drug  
effects  on these  psychophysiological  measures  are sex-specific.  Our current  NIMH  application  thus 
proposes the use of female subjects in within -subject studies of drug effects on PP I, LI and related  
measures. At present, approval for studies in females is sought only for studies with amphetamine and  
memantine.  Methods  for these  studies  will be identical  to those  described  above  for male  subjects,  with the 
following  exceptions:  1) urine  pregnancy  tests  (“Surecheck  Early  Pregnancy  Test”)  will be completed  at the 
time of initial  screening  and test day 2 (exclusion:  positive  test);  2) testing  will occur  only during  post-menses  
days  1-10; 3) blood will  be drawn  on the morning  of testing  and stored  for possible  later hormonal  analyses  
using  the GCRC/CTRI  laboratory  services;  a total of 5 cc will be collected  by [CONTACT_854940]/CTRI  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854921].  
12. INFORMED  CONSENT  
Recruitment of subjects and informed consent procedures will follow [CONTACT_67212]'s established methods.  
For all subjects we will have a consent form indicating any or all of the following procedures to be used:  
startle gating, mismatch negativity, gamma ba nd synchronization, MCCB, negative priming and latent  
inhibition.  Subjects included in drug studies will be told of any potential side effects they may expect from  
the drug to be used during testing. Specifically, all subjects will be asked to read a descr iption of the test  
drug, modified from the Physician’s Desk Reference, which includes the following information: 1) the  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_67154]; 2) the recommended starting dose for this drug, and details regarding  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_854922] s chedules; 3) common side effects experienced by [CONTACT_854941],  based  on trials  with the indicated  clinical  population;  and 4) an assessment  of the likelihood  that 
they will experience significant side effects from this drug, in the doses to be used in this study.  In all  
cases, fully informed consent will be obtained and [CONTACT_67212] will be directly available to clarify any  
questions raised by a subject. Signed and witnessed consents will be kept on file with other patient data.  
The UCSD IRB  has authorized  no waivers  or modifications  of normal  procedures.  
 
Subjects will be carefully screened to ensure their ability to comprehend study procedures, risks, and  
benefits. Potential participants will be fully informed of all risks and benefits prior  to giving their written  
informed  consent  and prior to enrollment  in the study.  Participants  will be asked  to repeat  back  
understanding of this material, and if there is any question as to whether a person is able to provide  
informed consent then they will  not be permitted to participate. A copy of the signed consent form will be  
stored in  a separate  locked  filing cabinet  from other  de-identified  coded  materials,  and a copy  will be given  
to the study  participant.  
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_1190531] Research Protections and Good Clinical Practice, in addition to being  
trained  by [CONTACT_45822]  (PI) on obtaining informed consent.  These  study  personnel  will also be 
authorized  to obtain  informed  consent  by [CONTACT_854942].  Informed  consent  will 
be documented using standardized IRB -approved forms. The forms will be presented to all po tential  
participants at the initial visit. Briefly, the informed consent form will describe the purpose of the study,  
procedures  and participant  involvement,  nature  of assessments  and treatments,  potential  risks,  alternatives  
to participation, costs and compensation, confidentiality, right to withdraw, potential benefits, relevant  
contact [CONTACT_6404], and  information  regarding the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  
(HIPAA) of 1996. Because participation in the propo sed study is entirely voluntary, patients can choose to  
discontinue the study at any point for any reason and this will in no way affect future medical treatment  
decisions  or practices.  
 
Genetic  Testing,  Material  & Storage:  One goal of this proposal  is to identify  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  
associated with differential sensitivity to drug effects on sensorimotor gating and neurocognition in clinically  
normal and schizophrenia subjects. To accomplish this, blood samples will be sought from all subjects by 
[CONTACT_67197]. Five ml (less than half of a tablespoon) of blood will be  
collected. DNA will be extracted by [CONTACT_67198]. Tubes will be stored in a -[ADDRESS_1190532]’s  
name  [CONTACT_854948].  
13. ALTERNATIVES  TO STUDY  PARTICIPATION  
As stated  in the current  consent  form,  the alternative  to study  participation  is to withdraw  from the study.  
14. POTENTIAL  RISKS  
Potential risks are minimal. The rating scales and questionnaires are innocuous. Startle testing exposes  
subjects  to the application  of skin tape electrodes  and to brief loud sounds,  which  in >[ADDRESS_1190533] session.  
3. Some participants may be embarrassed or feel uncomfortable by [CONTACT_854943].  
4. Eyeblink startle exposes subjects to the application of skin tape electrodes and to brief loud sounds,  
which  in our experience  has caused  no side effects.  
5. During  the study,  your blood  pressure and pulse  will be regularly monitored.  
6. Blood drawing may cause a small amount of pain.  In addition, a temporary bruise or “black and blue  
mark” may develop.  Rarely, people faint after having their blood drawn.  Very rarely, the vein in which  
the needle  has been  inserted  may become  inflamed  or infected,  which  can be treated.  
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_1190534]  recommended  starting  clinical  dose  for the drug.  To address  the potential  for some  of these  
drugs to produce changes in blood pressure, we will carefully monitor subjects’ vital signs, and will not  
release  subjects  from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854923].  To address  the possible  side 
effect of somnolence, we will instruct subjects to arrange for their transportation from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854924].  For studies  that include  women  of childbearing  potential,  there  is the possibility  of unforeseen  harm  to 
an unborn  child due to the administration  of drugs.  To address  this risk, all female  subjects  will be asked  to 
provide  a urine  sample  to test for pregnancy  and we will exclude  participants  who test positive.  Additionally,  
all female subjects in these studies will be required to use a non -drug birth control method, such as  
abstinence, diaphragm, non -hormone intrauterine device to prevent pregnancy during the study.  Subjects  
will be told to report  if their menst rual cycle  is inconsistent  or if suspect  that they are pregnant.  Drugs  will be 
dispensed  by a licensed  physician,  and a licensed  physician  will be present  on the premises  at all times  
during  testing.  The consent  forms  include  the related  risks specific  to the drug it refers  to. 
15. RISK  MANAGEMENT  PROCEDURES  AND  ADEQUACY  OF RESOURCES  
The overall  risks of this proposal are small. Protection of  subject confidentiality and privacy will  be 
rigorously guarded by [CONTACT_854944].  Resulting data will not be released to any subject, and released only to a patient’s primary  
physician  when an  appropriate  release  form is  signed by  [CONTACT_102].  The UCSD psychophysiology  
research laboratory of [CONTACT_67212] has studied over 1000 control subjects and patients without any  
problems with  confidentiality.  
 
For the drug evaluation study, risk management procedures include: 1) Subjects will be asked to refrain  
from alcohol or other drug use while on the study.  2) Each subject will receive a complete history and  
physical examination prior to acceptance into the study.  3) A battery of psychological tests will be  
administered, as will an EKG and urine toxicology scree n (which will also be used to test for pregnancy in  
drug studies including women of childbearing potential).  4) Subjects involved in studies with drugs will  
arrange for their transportation from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and any subject reporting any sedation upon com pletion  
of the study will be instructed to not operate a motor vehicle until the sedation is resolved. Subjects known  
or determined to have cardiovascular disease by [CONTACT_67201].  All subject  
information  will be  kept in a secure and locked area of  the laboratory,  CTF Building,  UCSD Medical  
Center.  Confidentiality  will be  protected  to the extent  provided  by [CONTACT_2371]. 
 
If a participant has any questions regarding the study, they may contact [CONTACT_978], Neal Swerdlow, M.D.,  
Ph.D.,  Monday -Friday, 8 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. at  (619) 543 -6270.  He may be  reached  after hours by  
[CONTACT_854945] (619)  543-[ADDRESS_1190535]  of the procedure  causes  
them  discomfort.  
 
Risks associated with specific study populations: Because the proposed studies include schizophrenia  
patients, it is important to consider any risks that might be specifically elevated in this study population. As  
noted above, clinical trials with schizophrenia patients in which daily dosing of [ADDRESS_1190536]  generally  reported  no or minimal  evidence  of either  clinical  
improvement  or adverse  events.  Thus,  the likelihood  that a single  pi[INVESTIGATOR_67158] 10 - 20 mg memantine  would  be 
associated with clinical changes is low. The population of schizophrenia patients to be enrolled in these  
studies  will come  primarily or  exclusively from  subjects  who are seeking  enrollment  in an existing  protocol  
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page 22  for supported  employment  (#071306,  [CONTACT_854950],  PI); based  on this, they will most  likely  be high 
functioning,  clinically  stable,  and (by [CONTACT_108])  seeking  employment.  Nonetheless,  should  the subjects  voice  
any thoughts of self -harm or suicidality, all testing staff are instructed to immediately contact [CONTACT_3433] e licensed  
physician who is on -site and covering each test session. The physician will then immediately evaluate the  
subject, and based on their clinical condition, might escort them across the street to the Emergency Room  
at the UCSD  Medical  Center  for further  evaluation  and, if necessary,  treatment.  It is important  to note that, in 
over [ADDRESS_1190537] unique identifiers (name, DOB, SS#, etc.) will never be connected with  
the de-identified  data.  When  published,  data will remain  de-identified,  though  subjects'  non-unique  
demographic  information  (age,  sex, ethnicity,  handedness,  diagnosis)  may be reported  together  with the de- 
identified data. No other information will be provided to entities beyond the PI [INVESTIGATOR_854925]. The PI’s UCSD research laboratory has studied over [ADDRESS_1190538]’s financial standing or employability.  There is  
also the possibility  of loss of confidentiality.  Research records  will be kept confidential  to the extent  allowed  
by [CONTACT_67204]. A study number will be used to identify information from participants. The database that relates  
the participants to a specific study number will be maintained using initials. Any database file will be  
encrypted  on a password -protected  computer.  
 
All recruitment, interviewing, consenting, physical examinations and testing will take place in a private  
setting, specifically a  dedicated  interview  room at  the UCSD  Medical  Center,  occupi[INVESTIGATOR_854926], physician and test subject, with the door closed, and a "DO NOT DISTURB" sign posted  
on the door.  
 
It is NOT reasonably foreseeable that the s tudy will collect information that Federal, State, and/or local  
laws/regulations requires to be reported to other officials (e.g., child or elder abuse; positive results from  
lab tests). However, as is true of any clinical population, and particularly in p atients with brain disorders, it  
is possible that subjects may exhibit severe psychiatric symptoms including the description of suicidal  
ideation. An on -call licensed physician is covering all studies; should any such clinical issues arise, the  
covering  physician  will be contact[CONTACT_854946].  
17. POTENTIAL  BENEFITS  
The information gained in these studies is expected to lead directly to a greater understanding of the  
pathophysiology  of serious  illnesses,  and will facilitate  the development  of novel treatment  strategies.  
For the drug evaluation study, those likely to benefit most from the proposed project are severely ill  
psychiatric patients, as enhanced understanding of their cognitive and neurochemical abnormalities will  
allow  for more  accurate  assessment  and treatment  of their symptoms.  Individual  subjects  will benefit  from a 
medical  and psychological  evaluation.  Control  subjects  are unlikely  to receive  any other  direct  benefits  from 
the proposed study other than the opportunity to contribute to efforts designed to relieve human suffering;  
there is evidence that participation in generative activities that improve self -esteem can have a positive  
impact  on an individual’s  quality  of life. Individuals  with schizophrenia  may or may  not benefit  from the long 
term goal of their study:  to identify  medications  that will enhance  the clinical  impact  of cognitive  interventions  
in psychiatric  patients.  
Biomedical  IRB Application  Instructions  
Page 23  18. RISK/BENEFIT  RATIO  
For the drug evaluation  study,  the risks from study  participation  include  mild discomfort  from drug effects,  
and the benefits  include  careful  medical  evaluation  and potential  gains  in self-esteem  among  study  
participants,  and significant  benefit  to patients  in terms  of knowledge  gained  related  to the nature  and 
optimal  treatments  of psychiatric  disorders.  The risk-benefit  ratio of this study  is very low.

20. COMPENSATION  FOR PARTICIPATION  
The subjects will be paid $30 for the SCREENING SESSION and $[ADDRESS_1190539] participation. Subjects that participate in the “WITHIN -SUBJECT” study  
will be paid $30 for the SCREENING  SESSION,  $[ADDRESS_1190540] day and $[ADDRESS_1190541] day.  This is a total of $260. Subjects will be reimbursed for pa rking costs on the  
SCREENING  and TEST days  and given  breakfast  and lunch  on the TEST  day. 
 
Participants  in the ONE -DAY study  will be paid a total of $30. Compensation  will be prorated  to $10 per hour

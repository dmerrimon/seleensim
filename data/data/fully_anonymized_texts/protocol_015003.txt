SPECIFIC AIMS  
Concisely state the objectives of  the study and the hypothesis being tested.  
This study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_322737].  
 
Our aims are:   
1. To measure pain  scores with activity at  24-, 48-, and 72-hours postoperatively after 
cesarean delivery  
2. To measure total post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_322738].  
3. To measure patient satisfaction with pain control, using a validated tool  
4. To describe  adverse events  related to liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_322739] -modal pain management 
after cesarean delivery will reduce pain scores with activity at [ADDRESS_398599] common inpatient surgical procedure in the Un ited States  [1]. 
There were 1.3  million cesar ean deliveries performed in 2014 , accounting for 32% of all 
deliveries, and representing a 60% increase since 1996  [2,3]. Prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_322740].  For many women, a cesarean delivery 
is her first major surgi cal procedure and may also be her  first exposure to prescription 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  Although opi[INVESTIGATOR_322741], there are associated risks  
and side effects , including respir atory depression, nausea, vomiting, postoperative ileus, 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_398600] on 
postoperative recovery.  
 
In addition, there is an ongoing nationwide epi[INVESTIGATOR_322742], acco unting for 
over 300,000 emergency  department visits per year [4].  Between 2000 and 2014, opi[INVESTIGATOR_46229] s far surpassed motor vehicle accidents as one of the leading causes of accidental 
death  [5,6]. Moreover, opi[INVESTIGATOR_322743] a pr imary source of prescription 
or illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_322744] , leading to adverse health consequences 
such as death from overdose [7,8] . Given the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817], there is significant interest in 
refining opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -sparing postoperative pain management strategies  across a variety of 
disciplines .  
 
There is a particular interest in the state of [LOCATION_005], which is experiencing a 
disproportionate burden of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817], with increasing rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_322745]. To begin to combat this problem, the state of [LOCATION_005] recently passed a law in 
March [ADDRESS_398601] the prescription of a great er than 7 -day supply of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and the 
governor has made opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554] a top priority [9].  
 
The current standard o f care for pain management after cesarean delivery includes long -acting 
intrathecal morphine, acetaminophen, NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or ketorolac, and oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
 
Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (trade name, Exparel [Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc]), is 1.3% 
bupiv acaine suspended in a liposomal formulation that allows for a controlled released of local 
anesthetic over time. The half -life of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_14072] 24 -34 hours; therefore, the impact 
of local anesthetic may be up to [ADDRESS_398602] similar to an obstetric 
population is a randomized trial comparing bilateral TAP blocks with 40cc bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% to 
60cc of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_322746]  
[10]. Relevant exclusion criteria included those with current use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], history of drug 
addiction, current pain at the time of surgery, and contraindications to acetaminophen or 
NSAIDs. Intrapartum anesthetic management was standardi zed across both groups. 
Postoperative pain management was with morphine PCA with standardized settings for 24h, 
followed by [INVESTIGATOR_17174] -needed oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and scheduled NSAIDs and acetaminophen throughout the 
postoperative period. The study was powered to detect a 2-point difference in the mean visual 
analog scale (VAS) for overall postoperative pain, from 4 to 2. The study met enrollment goals, 
and demonstrated improved pain scores and decreased postoperative use of IV and oral 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], approximately 17mg less in  IV morphine equivalents [10].  
 
Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_322747], and has the 
potential to significantly decrease the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_322748] a large population of women. It is 
currently FDA -approved to be used in a ny surgical site, and is also approved for women who 
are currently breastfeeding.  
 
A reduction in pain and inpatient opi[INVESTIGATOR_322749] -related side effects and may 
translate to a reduction in outpatient opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], thus decreasing the risks of opi[INVESTIGATOR_322750], ultimately resulting in fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related adverse events and deaths.  
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Briefly descri be study design and anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled 
by [CONTACT_17839] -wide and by [CONTACT_17840].  Provide a brief summary of the 
eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gender, medical condition).  Include an y local site 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, 2014     3  restrictions, for example, “Enrollment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s 
protocol is open to both children and adults.”
 
This study is a randomized  controlled trial. A total of  80 patients  will be randomized 1:1 to 
intervention (liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) versus control (placebo solution).  
 
Inclusion criteria:  
(1) Scheduled cesarean delivery via Pfannenstiel incision ; 
(2) Planned neuraxial anesthetic with intrathecal morphine and fentanyl administrati on. 
 
Exclusion criteria:   
(1) Current or prior use of methadone, buprenorphine, or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_322751] ;  
(2) Contraindication to neuraxial anesthetic;  
(3) Allergy to local anesthetic;  
(4) Planned general anesthetic;  
(5) Age less than 18  years on the date of  enrollment . 
 
Women will not be excluded if they received general anesthesia after neuraxial anesthesia with 
intrathecal morphine  was administered.  
 
Briefly describe study procedures.  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Subjects 
enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study.”  Describe 
study endpoints.
 
The planned intervention is the infiltration of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (or placebo) at the time of 
fascial closure at a Pfannenstiel incision, after the  delivery of the infant and repair of the 
hysterotomy. We will instill a total of 80cc (20cc liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_322752] 60cc of 
normal saline, or 80cc placebo) into the surgical site.  
 
The total 80cc will be divid ed in to 4 20 cc syringes with a 22G needle. The  dilutions and 
aliquoting into the syringes will be performed by [CONTACT_322762].   
 
The procedure to instill the drug is as follows: Once the patient is in the operating room, 
neuraxial anesthesia will  be administered per routine practice. A Pfannenstiel skin incision will 
be made. The usual cesarean delivery procedure will be performed at the discretion of the 
surgeon. Once the surgical team is about to begin fascial closure, the study drug will then b e 
infiltrated by a member of the study team  (WHB, BJW , MP, or MAC  – all of whom are 
obstetrician s and trained in drug infiltration ), with 50% of the study solution in subcutaneous 
space and 50% in the fascial  plane, taking care to evenly spread the drug in the superior and 
inferior aspects of the incision. For the fascial infiltration, liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_322753]. The remainder of the cesarean delivery will proceed accord ing 
to the usual fashion. We recommend suture closure for a subcutaneous wound > 2cm and 
suture closure of the skin, as both of these are evidence -based practices to decrease wound 
complications. We also recommend not using Mastozol for improved applicatio n of steri -strips. 
At any point in the cesarean delivery, the surgeon may chose to administer or withhold 
ketorolac.  
 
Post-operative pain management will be: intrathecal morphine, scheduled ketorolac 30mg IV x 
24h followed by [CONTACT_322763] 600mg q6h x 24h, sch eduled Tylenol 650mg q6h x 48h, and prn 
oxycodone 5 -10mg q4h. This is the current pain management protocol for postoperative women 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_398603] 48 hours of scheduled NSAIDs and Tylenol, 
these medications will be available as needed for additional pain control.  
 
Outcomes includ e:  
The primary outcome is pain score with activity at 48 -hours and 72 -hours postoperatively. A 
visual analog scale will be shown to the patient at both time points.  
 
Additional outcomes to be collected from the participants include:  
1. Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], con verted to morphine milligram equivalents using this converter 
(http://www.globalrph.com/narcotic.cgi) at [ADDRESS_398604] -operative pain control, using a validated tool (Pain OUT)  (at 48h only)  
3. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related adverse events: nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, dizziness, drowsiness, 
based on patient self -report.  
4. Pain scores with rest and activity at 24h post -operatively   
5. Pre-operative anxiety, using validated tool (GAD7)  
6. Planned mode of feeding (antepartum), and actual mode of feeding upon discharge  and at [ADDRESS_398605]  abstraction include:  
1. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].  
2. Inpatient or outpatient (followed for 6 weeks from delivery) wound complication (breakdown, 
seroma, hematoma, infection). This is alread y recorded in the medical record.  
3. Allergic reaction attributable to local anesthetic. This is already recorded in the medical 
record.  
4. Local anesthetic toxicity. This is already recorded in the medical record.  
5. Operative time of cesarean delivery (skin incis ion to skin closure). This is already recorded 
in the medical record.  
6. Number of oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_322754] . This is already recorded in the medical 
record.  
 
For studies involving treatment or diagnosis, provide inf ormation about standard of care at 
Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from standard care.  
Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedures, or methods of diagnosis.
 
Current pain management for a cesarean delivery includes administration of intrathecal 
morphine, followed by [CONTACT_322764], ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], most 
commonly oxycodone. If a patient has a contraindication to any of these medications, th ey will 
not be administered.  
 
Describe how risks to subjects are minimized, for example, by [CONTACT_322765].
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_398606]’s experience of their inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], with the majority of 
their care proceeding according to routine care.  
 
Subjects enrolled in  this study will be monitored for unanticipated problems, including adverse 
events, and if these occur, they will be reported to the Partners Human Research 
Committee/IRB, in accordance with the guidelines Reporting Unanticipated Problems including 
Adverse  Events . 
 
Describe explicitly the methods for ensuring the safety of subjects.  Provide objective criteria for 
removing a subject from the study, for example, objective criteria for worsening disease/lack of 
improvement and/ or unacceptable adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is 
especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups.
 
At the time of infiltration, subjects’ vitals signs and stability are closely monitored by [CONTACT_322766]. Should there be any immediate local anesthetic toxicity, this would identified 
by [CONTACT_101034].  
 
Subjects  will be monitored routinely on the postpartum floor for signs of local anesthetic toxicity.  
In general, the postoperative stay after a cesarean delivery is [ADDRESS_398607] this decision.   
 
FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects.  Include those 
related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/performed solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and risks related to privacy and 
confi dentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_17779].
 
Potential risks include increased bleeding in the subcutaneous space or subfascial space, with 
infiltration of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_322755] a field block. If this ble eding were to occur, it is not 
likely that it would be concealed and lead to an unanticipated hematoma; however, additional 
hemostatic measures may be necessary. These measures are commonly employed at 
cesarean delivery, even in the absence of infiltration  of a substance, as these are areas that are 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, 2014     6  at risk of hematoma formation. To minimize this risk, we will ensure adequate hemostasis prior 
to subcutaneous space closure.  
 
Another potential intraoperative risk is increased operative time. We anticipate tha t the time 
needed to complete liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_322756] 2 -3 minutes. However, if 
a patient’s regional anesthetic is inadequate to complete surgery, additional anesthetic may 
need to be administered to account for the longer operat ive time. One surgeon will perform all 
infiltrations both to standardize the procedure and to minimize time spent performing the 
infiltration.  
 
Post-operatively, the risk of wound complication may be increased by [CONTACT_322767] t he incision. There is no reported data to support this concern in the prior study of 
liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_322757].  
 
After enrollment, we may discover the patient has untreated anxiety, based on the GAD7. If the 
score suggests signif icant anxiety (GAD7 score >=10), we will alert the patient’s primary 
obstetrician.  
 
Finally, potential risks include a small amount of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_322758]. Although 
the goal of this formulation is for the drug to not become systemic, this may occur. Liposomal  
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_274688] -approved for breastfeeding women. Moreover, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_322759] a 
neonate’s gut cannot be absorbed systemically, thus minimizing the risk to the neonate.  
 
Psychosocial risks include creating an expectation of improved pain control that may not be 
borne out, either because the patient may receive the placebo, or because liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_322760].  
 
In addition to the risks above, there may be additional unanticipated risks to subjects or other 
persons that are encountered through the course of this study. We will monitor subjects and 
other persons for unanticipated problems, including adverse events,  and if these occur, they will 
be reported to the Partners Human Research Committee/IRB, in accordance with the guidelines 
Reporting Unanticipated Problems including Adverse Event s. 
 
 
EXPECTED BENEFITS  
Describe both the expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the research and the 
importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provide 
a brief, realistic summary of potential benefits to subjects, for example, “It is hoped that the 
treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  
Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being 
studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledg e of human physiology or behavior, 
improved safety, or technological advances.  
 
Potential benefits to participating individuals include improved pain control in the immediate 
post-operative period, thus resulting in fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_27251]. This  may lead to other benefits, 
including earlier ambulation, earlier return of bowel function, possibly earlier readiness for 
discharge.  
 
Potential benefits to our patient population include the possibility for increasing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -
minimizing strategies for pai n management after cesarean delivery, the most common surgery 
performed in the U.S.

RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail the specific methodology that will be used to recruit subjects.  Specifically 
address how, when, where and by [CONTACT_94878].  Inc lude any specific recruitment methods used to enhance recruitment of women 
and minorities.
 
All obstetric providers (physicians, midwives, clinic nurses, labor nurses, postpartum nurses) at 
MGH will be made aware of this study.  
 
One study physician (MP) w ill identify patients with scheduled cesarean deliveries and contact 
[CONTACT_102]’s primary provider to inform the patient that this study physician will approach them 
about the study. If the patient’s primary provider feels the patient is not an appropriat e study 
candidate, or the patient declines to hear about the study, the patient will not be approached by 
[CONTACT_5989]. A flier will be used to educate patients in outpatient obstetric clinics about 
the study.  
 
If the patient agrees to hear m ore, she will be approached by a  study p hysician during a routine 
clinic visit [ADDRESS_398609] of care, 
the intent of the study, and the potential risks and benefits. If a patient desires to enroll, 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_398610] about the study over the telephone and would like to participate, we 
will pursue phone recruitment and consent if the following conditions can be met: (1) have a 
means to receive and return the consent form electronically; (2) have the time  to go through 
each section of the consent form with the study physician on the phone; (3) affirm their comfort 
with English as the primary language. If this is possible, an email will be sent securely with 
“send secure” in the subject line. The faxed/emailed back copy will be printed in the chart, with 
the consenting study physician signing the copy upon receiving it, and the patient will be 
requested to bring their version on the scheduled surgical date so that the same study physician 
can sign the consent form. A note will be made in the chart regarding the patient’s participation 
and phone consent.  
 
There will also be recruitment fliers posted in the outpatient clinic restrooms, as this is the 
designated space in the outpatient clinic for all r ecruitment fliers for research studies.  
 
 
The study has been named the PENGUIN study, for ease of remembering, for patients and 
providers alike. Postperative pain: Exparel iNjection with the Goal of Understanding the Impact 
on Numeric Pain Score. Cartoon penguins are pi[INVESTIGATOR_322761].  
 
 
 
Provide details of remuneration, when applicable.  Even when subjects may derive medical 
benefit from participation, it is often the case that extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], meals at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
parking fees or other inconveniences will result in additional out -of-pocket expenses related to 
study participation.  Investigators may wish to consider providing reimbursement for such 
expenses when funding is available
 
There will be no  remuneration for study participation.

CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_322768], and the timing of consent 
(i.e., how long subjects will be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more 
than minimal risk and all studies involving investigational drugs/devices, a licensed physician 
investigator must obtai n informed consent.  When subjects are to be enrolled from among the 
investigators’ own patients, describe how the potential for coercion will be avoided.
 
Consent will be obtained by a  study physician (MP) at a clinic visit [ADDRESS_398611] a private obstetric clinic or work in another 
faculty obstetric outpatient clinic for the duration of this study.  
 
NOTE: When subjects are unable to give consent due to age ( minors) or impaired decision -
making capacity, complete the forms for Research Involving Children as Subjects of Research 
and/or Research Involving Individuals with Impaired Decision -making Capacity, available on

DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
Describe the plan for monitoring the data to ensure the safety of subjects.  The plan should 
include a  brief description of (1) the safety and/or efficacy data that will be reviewed; (2) the 
planned frequency of review; and (3) who will be responsible for this review and for determining 
whether the research should be altered or stopped.  Include a brief de scription of any stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_94859], when appropriate.  Depending upon the risk, size and complexity of the 
study, the investigator, an expert group, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) or others might be assigned primary respo nsibility for this monitoring activity.        
 
NOTE: Regardless of data and safety monitoring plans by [CONTACT_17846], the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17782], safety, and welfare of subjects 
under his/her car e. 
 
As this is a small trial, we do not plan an external committee to monitor outcome data. One 
study physician (MP) will receive all safety reports. There will be no interim analysis of primary 
outcome data. However, safety and adverse event data will be reviewed by 1 study physician as 
the events occur. If >20% of patients have a wound complication (approximately three times our 
normal rate), the study team will gather and terminate the study early. Adverse events  will be 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_398612] include any local anesthetic allergic reaction, wound complication, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -
related side effects.  
 
 
Describe the plan to be followed by [CONTACT_079]/study staff for review of adverse 
events experienced by [CONTACT_17847]/her care, and when applicable, for review of sponsor 
safety reports and DSMB reports.  Describe the plan for reporting  adverse events to the sponsor 
and the Partners’ IRB and, when applicable, for submitting sponsor safety reports and DSMB 
reports to the Partners’ IRBs.  When the investigator is also the sponsor of the IND/IDE, include 
the plan for reporting of adverse ev ents to the FDA and, when applicable, to investigators at 
other sites.   
 
NOTE: In addition to the adverse event reporting requirements of the sponsor, the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_181734] f or Adverse Event 
Reporting
 
Study staff  will closely monitor all adverse events as above. Any serious adverse events will be 
reported to the sponser, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, also the drug manufacturer, and the IRB, 
particularly if it is a reason to halt th e trial or terminate the trial early. Unanticipated problems or 
harms to study subjects or others, including adverse events, will be reported to the IRB, in 
accordance with the guidelines Reporting Unanticipated Problems including Adverse Events . 
 
MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Describe the plan to be followed by [CONTACT_458]/study staff to monitor and assure 
the validity and integrity of the data and adherence to the IRB -approved protocol.  Specify who 
will be resp onsible for monitoring, and the planned frequency of monitoring.  For example, 
specify who will review the accuracy and completeness of case report form entries, source 
documents, and informed consent.   
 
NOTE: Regardless of monitoring plans  by [CONTACT_17846], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_145478]/her investigative site in 
accordance with the IRB -approved protocol, and applicable regulations and requirements of the 
IRB.
 
One study physician (MP) will primarily be responsible for adhering to this protocol, with 
recruitment methods, administration of intervention, and assessment of outcomes in the post -
operative period. The PI (WHB) and 1 study physician (MP) will ensure the a ccuracy and 
completeness of consent forms and data entry forms. The PI (WHB), study physician, and 
research coordinator will meet at every 2 week intervals to discuss recruitment, study 
implementation, and adherence to study protocol. The study team will b e blinded to the 
intervention performed until the groups are revealed by [CONTACT_322769]. The injecting clinician for a particular patient will not be blinded as to what 
was injected, but will not be involved in that sa me patient’s outcomes assessment.

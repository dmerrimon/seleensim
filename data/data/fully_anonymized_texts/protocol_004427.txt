Describe the background and rationale for this project. Reference to 
peer reviewed literature is desirabl e: Endotracheal intubation is the gold 
standard for securing the airway. H owever , while managing patients with difficult 
airways, v arious supraglottic devices have been used as rescue airway devices. 
Laryngeal mask airways ( LMAs) are among  the most commonl y used supraglottic 
device s. After placement, subsequent intubation with an endotracheal tube via 
the LMA is achieved either blindly or with  the use of a fiber optic device . Several 
modifications of the LMA have been developed since its introduction in [ADDRESS_230244] included  the intuba ting 
LMA (I -LMA) and variants ( LMA Fastrach , Air-Q and LMA -Supreme) .  
 
Another supraglottice device and variant of the LMA is known as the i -gel.  The i-
gel does not have an inflatable cuff. In the i -gel, the traditional cuff of the LMA is 
replaced with a soft, gel -like, and transparent thermoplastic elastomer (styrene 
ethylene butadiene styrene) which is a mirror impression of the 
supraglottic /periglottic  anatomy  and creates a non -inflatable seal.1 The unique 
features of i -gel also include a separate conduit for gastric suction , an epi[INVESTIGATOR_193814], and a ridged flattened stem to aid insertion and  reduc e the risk of axial 
rotation, a rigid stem and a bite block.2,3 The i-gel® has also been used in 
rescue airway management and as a conduit for tracheal intubation.3-[ADDRESS_230245] of the  i-gel versus the Air-Q LMA  in pediatric patients.   By 
[CONTACT_193816], we will determine 
which device provides a clearer passage to the glottic opening and is therefore 
the preferred conduit to aid endotracheal intubation in difficult airways.  
 
 
Describe the significance of the proposed resear ch:  
Although management of the difficult airway is generally rare in the pediatric 
population, it is one of the leading causes of perioperative morbidity and 
mortality.  Simple and effective techniques to secure the difficult airway are 
needed.  This stud y would help define the optimal supraglottic device for that 
purpose.  
 
State the primary and secondary objectives of the study:  We will  
compare th e fiberoptic view of the glottic  aperture by [CONTACT_15728] a fiber optic 
bronchoscope through two types of supraglott ice airways (the Air -Q LMA or the i -
gel LMA ). 
  
If this research is hypothesis driven, succinctly state the hypothesis:  
The i-gel LMA will provide a better bronchoscopic view of the glottic aperature 
than the Air -Q LMA.  
  
Outline the major steps and method ologies in the clinical protocol(s).    
If necessary, include a description of any procedures being performed 
already for diagnostic or treatment purposes : General a nesthesia with the 
use of an LMA or supraglottic device  is routinely performed on more than half of 
the pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia  every day in our operating 
rooms .  There will be no change in the anesthetic care during these procedures; 
however, 100 patients would be randomized to one of two types of supraglottic 
devices; i -gel or LMA (Air -Q). Following placement of the supraglottic device , a 
fiberoptic bronchoscope will be inserted through the LMA  to its distal end  and a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_193815].   The following scoring system will 
be used13,14: 
 1. vocal cords not seen, but ventilation adequate  
 2. vocal cords + anterior epi[INVESTIGATOR_24050]  
 3.  vocal cords + posterior epi[INVESTIGATOR_24050]  
 4. only vocal cords seen  
  
Placement of the fiberoptic bronchoscope will be performed after the 
adminis tration of general anesthesi a and 100% oxygen to avoid any risk of 
oxygen desaturation. The procedure will take less than [ADDRESS_230246].  Given this, there is no additio nal risk although the use 
of the fiberoptic bronchoscope for the purpose of the study only.  
 
Identify the variables to be measured and how they will be statistically 
evaluated : A Fishers’ exact test and a contingency table will be used to 
compare the bronc hoscopic view through the two different supraglottic devices.  
Most importantly, the percentage of acceptable/good view (grade 3 or 4) will be 
compared to poor view (grade 1).

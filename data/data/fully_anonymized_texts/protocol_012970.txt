IL-[ADDRESS_490560] bermekimab  is MABp1, a recombinant human IgG1 
monoclonal antibody spe cific for human interleukin-1 α (IL-1α). The entire bermekimab  heavy and 
light chain sequences are identical to those found in naturally -occurring human IgG1 κ, with the 
light and heavy chain variable regions being identical to those originally expressed by a peripheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a healthy individual. No in vitro  affinity maturation or 
modifications have been made to improve its natural binding affinity (211 +/- 31 pM). We believe that a true human antibody should be effectively non- immunogenic in humans and thus exhibit 
optimal activity and pharmacokinetics.  XBiotech has conducted [ADDRESS_490561] been completed in dermatologic indications (acne, psoriasis and pyoderma gangrenosum), along with  one investigator sponsored study in 
Hidradenitis Suppurativa
1,2,3.  Subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis experienced a rapid 
reduction in their psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), and subjects with acne vulgaris experienced reductions of inflammatory lesion counts, as well as reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390899] (HADS). In both of these trials, there were few adverse events, which were all grade 1 (mild) and the only events that appeared to be related to therapy were mild injection site reactions in two patients.   The investigator initiated study enrolled patients with moderate to severe HS that were refractory to or not eligible for treatment with TNF blocking agents .  The study was double blind, randomized

 and placebo controlled, and utilized the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) score as a primary endpoint. Ten patients were randomized to placebo and 10 patients to treatment with bermekimab .  A positive HiSCR score after 12 weeks was found in one (10%) and six (60%) 
patients respectively (OR: 13.5 0; 95%CIs: 1.19- 152.61; p: 0.035). After withdrawal of therapy at 
week 12, a positive HiSCR score was found in nil (0%)  of the placebo group and four (40%)  of the 
treated  patients after 24 weeks (p: 0.043).    
 Endogenous anti -IL-1α antibodies are present in 5% to 28% of the general population
4,5,6,7.  No 
negative correlations with disease have been noted for these individuals. To the contrary, the presence of natural anti- IL-1α antibodies has been associated with favorable outcomes, both with 
respect to rheumatoid arthritis and ischemic heart disease. Animal studies also indicate that IL -1α 
loss or antagonism does not result in harm. Moreover, the well -tolerated use of other approved 
biological agents that employ  alternative other strategies to block IL -[ADDRESS_490563] that 
bermekimab’s targeting of IL -1α represents a safe treatment approach.  
 1.2 Rationale  Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common disorder affecting areas of the skin rich in apocrine glands. HS typi[INVESTIGATOR_390900]. The c linical course is characterized by [CONTACT_390916] o f flare-ups. During these flare -ups the affected gland becomes swollen and then 
ruptures, with the discharge of purulent material. The duration of a flare -up is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_490564] among 
skin disorders in terms of adversely affecting quality of life9. 
 HS is a common disorder. Its prevalence in Europe is 0.97%
3 whereas in Denmark this  figure  is 
reported to be 4%4. A recent review of electronic records in the [LOCATION_002] revealed an incidence 
of 11.4 per 100,000 in the general population incidence10. The incidence  was 2.5 times higher 
among African Americans than among white Americans11. 
 Based on findings showing high expression of tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNFα) in the lesions 
of patients
12, the fully humanized monoclonal anti -TNF antibody adalimumab  was studied for  
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.                                                                                           PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.[ADDRESS_490565] 2018                                             PAGE 13 of 50 
 treatment of  HS. Two large -scale randomized clinical  studies (RCT) were conducted, designated 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597] I and PI[INVESTIGATOR_336635], which shared a common study design. Following an initial loading 
dose of 160 mg and a second 80 mg dose after two weeks, adalimumab was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 40 mg every  week , and efficacy was compared to  that in  placebo -
treated patients. The primary efficacy endpoint for both PI[INVESTIGATOR_390901] 12 weeks of 
treatment. This efficacy endpoint was the achievement of a positive hidradenitis suppurativa clinical response (HiSCR) score. After the initial 12 -week treatment course, patients allocated to 
placebo were maintained to placebo whereas patients allocated to adalimumab were either  switched 
to an open label extension (OLE) arm , or were further randomized to placebo, adalimumab 40 mg 
every other week or adalimumab 40 mg every week. Results showed that a positive HiSCR was found in 28.6% of placebo- treated patients and in 41% of adalimumab -treated patients of the 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597] I study and in 27.6% of placebo- treated patients and in 58.9% of adalimumab -treated 
patients in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_390902]
13. As stated above, after the first [ADDRESS_490566] 12 weeks of treatment, 88 
patients were switched to an OLE receiving 40 mg of adalimumab every week; positive HiSCR was achieved at weeks 120 and 168 in 56.8% and 52.3% respectively
14. Adalimumab has been 
registered in both [LOCATION_003] and Europe for moderate to severe HS based on the results of the two PI[INVESTIGATOR_390903].  
 Adal imumab is an important advance for the treatment of HS. However, there re mains considerable 
unmet need for patients with HS, including 41% to 58% of patients  who have primary response 
failures after 12 weeks of adalimumab treatment  and the 30- 50% patients that have a positive initial 
response to treatment but relapse after [ADDRESS_490567] lesions better characterized 
by [CONTACT_390917] (IL) -1β and IL -1α
15. In a small randomized study 
ten patients were allocated to treatment with placebo and nine patients to treatment with anakinra (IL-[ADDRESS_490568] targeting both IL -1β and IL -1α). A positive HiSCR score was achieved 
in 30% and 78%  of patients,  respectively (p: 0.039)
16. These results suggested that inhibition of IL -
[ADDRESS_490569] trial among patients not eligible for adalimumab (EudraCT 
number 2015-002321- 20; ClinicalTrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was recently completed and showed 
promising results for  activity of bermekimab  in HS . Twenty patients with severe HS and with either 
primary or secondary failure of previous antiTNF agents, or who were  unwilling to receive 
subcutaneous adalimumab  treatment , were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive, in a blinded fashion, 
every other week treatment with placebo or bermekimab  at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg IV. T reatment was 
administered intravenously for 12 weeks.  The primary efficacy endpoint was the positive HiSCR score, that was achieved among 10% of patients allocated to placebo and 60% of patients allocated 
to bermekimab . The odds ratio for positive HiSCR after 12 weeks of treatment was 13.50 (95% 
confidence intervals 1.19- 152.51, p: 0.035). Analysis of the secondary endpoints showed some 
remarkable advantages of b ermekimab  treatment versus placebo treatment: a) blind follow -up for 
12 weeks after stop pi[INVESTIGATOR_390904] , in that a  positive 
HiSCR score was found in 40%  of the treatment group  and 0%  of patients receiving placebo  (p: 
0.043); b) positive patient reported outcomes were found at week 12 in 70% and 30% respectively (p: 0.010); c) the median time to new HS flare- up was prolonged to 11 weeks and 7 weeks 
respectively; d) with the use of dermal ultrasound at week 12, a  20% or more decrease in total depth 
of involved skin lesions was found in 77.8% and 22.2% , respectively (p: 0.029); and e) serum IL -
8 was decreased at week 12 in 90% and 40% respectively (p: 0.029)
17. 
 In previous dermatology studies bermekimab  was well tolerated and showed impressive therapeutic 
activity. Dose ranging for the subcutaneous formulation of bermekimab  is now being studied in a

light and heavy chain variable regions being identical to those originally expressed by a peripheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a healthy individual.

 The bermekimab  primary glycoform has a molecular weight of 148.1 kilodaltons. Like all IgG1 
molecules, the heavy chains are joined at their hinge regions through two disulfide linkages, and 
each heavy chain is joined to one light chain through one disulfide linkage between their CH
1 and 
CL domains respectively.  
 The main isoform has a pI [INVESTIGATOR_12862] 9.2 and comprises about 70- 80% of the total isoform population 
in all lots that have been manufactured to date, as determined by [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_12863]. The heavy chain CH
2 domains are glycosylated primarily with the oligosaccharide structure shown in 
Figure 2.1, as determined by [CONTACT_12894]. The glycosylated residue 
(Asn -302 as numbered from the N -terminus of bermekimab ) has been determined by [CONTACT_390918][INVESTIGATOR_390905] N -linked glycosylation site as found in endogenous 
IgG1 (Asn -297 according to the gener ic numbering system). Similarly, the primary glycan, 
commonly referred to as G0F, is the same as that found on about 22% of endogenous human IgG molecules
18.  
 The entire bermekimab  heavy and light chain sequences are identical to those found in naturally-
occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and heavy chain variable regions being identical to those 
originally expressed by a peripheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a heal thy 
individual.    Endogenous anti -IL-1α antibody has been reported in 5% to 28% of healthy serum or plasma 
samples
19,20. It has been measured in cord blood, children  and adults21. The anti-IL-1α antibodies

 2.6 AGENT ORDERING  
The Responsible Investigational Pharmacy will order study drug from XBiotech as needed.  
 
2.7 POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS  
There are no known drug interactions with bermekima b. In controlled trials that combined the use 
of IL -1ra (anakinra) with TNF alpha inhibitors, a higher incidence of serious infection was noted. 
Bermekimab  has not been administered concomitantly with these agents in clinical trials. However, 
due to potential risk, it is not recommended that bermekimab  be used in combination with anti -
TNF agents.   
 
2.8 PROHIBITED AND RESTRICTED THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_390907], including: 
• Systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_390908], including corticosteroids, retinoids, or 
anti-androgen (hormonal) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
• Intralesional /topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826]  
• Laser/light therapi[INVESTIGATOR_390909]. A second flare up of disease and subsequent use of a second rescue therapy for any patient 
will result in the patient being treated as a non -responder for the purpo ses of data analysis.   
 The following concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_390910]: 
• Biologics that target IL -1 or TNF -alpha 
• Live virus vaccines  
• Investigational agents other than b ermekimab  
  
3.  STUDY DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES

5.5 PATIENT CROSSOVER RULES  
Patients enrolled in the 200mg dose study are  eligible to receive 400mg b ermekimab  
injections upon consent to this protocol. Upon consent, patients will begin 400mg bermekimab dosing at next Study Day Visit, following patient calendar so that total number of bermekimab injections, 200mg + 400mg, is equal to [ADDRESS_490601] 2018                                             PAGE 35 of 50 
 6.  CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
6.1 PHARMACOKINETICS (PK) SAMPLE COLLECTION  An enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to specifically measure 
bermekimab  levels in human plasma. Blood w ill be drawn into a single 6 ml collection  tube at each 
PK collection time point (sample collection is  pre-dose at visit 1, visit 3, visit 5, visit 9 and visit 
13). These samples will be collected per the study lab manual and immediately shipped to the Sponsor for PK analysis. The PK samples will also be used to test for the presence of antibodies against bermekimab . 
  
7.  ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_12902], vital signs, physical examinations, and 
clinical laboratory measurements. All subjects will be included in the safety analysis.  Adverse events will be monitored from visit 1  (post -injection) through visit 14.  Any serious adverse events 
or grade [ADDRESS_490602] stabilized.     
 
Any AE (with the exception of worsening HS  symptoms or injection site reactions) of grade [ADDRESS_490603] demography (age, sex, race, height, weight, and 
BMI) medical history, medication history, and prior biologic use for each patient.  Characteristics of the patients  with hidradenitis suppurativa , including duration of disease, baseline disease severity 
scores (HiSCR, modified Sartorius score, and physician’s  global assessment), baseline 
inflammatory lesion counts (abscesses and inflammatory nodules) , and baseline patient reported 
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.                                                                                           PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.[ADDRESS_490604] 2018                                             PAGE 36 of 50 
 outcomes (VAS for pain, VAS for disease severity, and DLQI) , will be collected.   Baseline is 
defined as the visit 1 , pre-injection assessment.  
8.2 Study Endpoints  
 The primary endpoint of this study is  the safety and tolerability of  bermekimab  at 400 mg weekly 
subcutaneous dose.  The secondary endpoints include: 
• Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) score  (baseline to visit 13) . For this score 
patients are defined as achievers or non -achievers. The positive HiSCR score is defined as a 
≥ 50% reduction in inflammatory lesion AN count (sum of abscesses and inflammatory 
nodules), and no increase in abscesses or draining fistulas in HS compared with the lesions counted on visit 1
23. The HiSCR score , including inflammatory lesion count, will be measured 
on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. 
• Pharmacokinetics (P K) (baseline to visit 13) . An enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) has been developed to specifically measure bermekimab  levels in human plasma. 
Blood w ill be drawn into a single 6 ml  collection  tube at each PK collection time point (sample 
collection is pre- dose at visit 1, visit 3, visit 5, visit 9 and visit 13). These samples will be 
collected per the study lab manual and immediately shipped to the Sponsor for PK analysis. The PK samples will also be used to test for the presence of antibodies against b ermekimab . 
• Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA)  (baseline to visit 13) . This is defined as: a) clear when 
the total number of abscesses is 0, the total number of draining fistulas is 0, the total number of inflammatory nodules is 0 and the total number of  non- inflammatory nodules is 0; b) 
minimal when the total number of abscesses is 0, the total number of draining fistulas is 0, the total number of inflammatory nodules is 0 and there is presence of non- inflammatory nodules; 
c) mild when the total number of abscesses is 0, the total number of draining fistulas is 0, and the total number of inflammatory nodules is 1- 4, or when there is presence of one abscess or 
draining fistula   and absence of any inflammatory nodules; d) moderate when the total number 
of abscesses is 0, the total number of draining fistulas is [ADDRESS_490605] 5; or when there is presence of one abscess or draining fistula and at least one inflammatory nodule; or when there are 2- 5 abscesses or draining fistulas and fewer than 
10 inflammatory nodules; e) severe when the total number of abscesses or draining fistulas is 2-[ADDRESS_490606] 10; and f) very severe when there 
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.                                                                                           PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.[ADDRESS_490607] 2018                                             PAGE 37 of 50 
 are more than 5 abscesses or draining fistulas24.  The PGA will be measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 
7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. 
• Disease Activity Score (baseline to visit 13) . This is defined as the sum of scores of all affected 
areas of each patient. Each area will be evaluated by [CONTACT_51632]: (multiplication of the two largest diameters in each affected area in mm) x (the degree of inflammation of each lesion). This  score has been proposed by [CONTACT_390920]
25. The Disease Activity Score will be 
measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. 
• The modified Sartorius score  (baseline to visit 13) . The Sartorius Scale is used to quantify the 
severity of HS. Points are awarded for 12 body areas (left and right axillae, left and right sub/inframammary areas, intermammary area, left and right buttocks, left and right inguino -
crural folds, perianal area, perineal area, and other): points were awarded for nodules (2 points 
for each); abscesses (4 points); fistulas (4 points); scars (1 point); other findings (1 point); and longest distance between two lesions (2 -6 points, 0 if no lesions); and if lesions ar e separated 
by [CONTACT_37266] (yes -0 points; no- 6 points). The total Sartorius score is the sum of the 12 
regional scores.  The modified Sartorius score will be measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 
and 14. 
• Change in AN count  (baseline to visit 13) . The sum of abscesses and inflammatory nodules  for 
each patient will be measured  on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. 
• Change in VAS for Disease Severity  and Pain (baseline to visit 13) . Patient reported visual 
analogue scales for pain and disease severity will be measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 
14. 
• Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) (baseline to visit 13) . This will be measured 
on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. 
• Change in  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12845]  (HADS ) (baseline to v isit 13) . This will be 
measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. 
Changes in secondary endpoints will be presented by [CONTACT_322429], as well as combined across both cohorts.  
9.  ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENT (AE) 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with the pharmaceutical or 
biological agent under study.  An AE can therefore be any of the following: 
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.                                                                                           PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.[ADDRESS_490608] 2018                                             PAGE 38 of 50 
 • Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including laboratory findings), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of bermekimab , whether or not it is apparently related to 
bermekimab ; 
• A concurrent illness ; 
• An exacerbation, or an unexpected increas e in frequency or intensity of a preexisting 
condition, including intermittent or epi[INVESTIGATOR_11238].   
• A significant or unexpected worsening of the condition/indication under investigation.   
• A suspected interaction between the investigational drug and c oncomitant medications  
• Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality (including radiological interpretations, histopathological findings, et c.) 
 
9.2 DEFINITION OF SER IOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that  meets any of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death;  
• Life-threatening; 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
• Results in a persistent or significant disability;  
• An important medical event that, while it may not result in death or be immediately life -
threatening or require/prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed ab ove. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
 
Note that seriousness and severity should not be confused. A subject could experience a severe headache that would not qualify as an SAE, while another might experience a mild stroke that, while not severe, would be considered serious.  
 9.[ADDRESS_490609] events occurring between visit 1  and visit 14  (or if subject terminates from study prior 
to visit 14, seven days after the last administration of bermekimab ) on the eCRF , regardless of 
whether they are considered related to study drug.  
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.                                                                                           PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.[ADDRESS_490610] medical terminology as c oncisely as possible.  The AE 
recorded should not be a procedure or a clinical/laboratory measurement but should reflect the event leading to the procedure or the cause of the clinical/laboratory abnormality, if known.  Whenever possible, AEs should be evaluated and recorded as a diagnosis, rather than individual signs and symptoms.  However , if a definitive diagnosis is not possible, the individual signs and 
symptoms should be recorded.  Any AE that worsens in intensity, or becomes serious, should be recorded as a new event.  
 9.[ADDRESS_490611] be considered.  Relationship to study drug is summarized as follows: 
• Not Related:   There is another obvious cause of the AE  
• Unlikely to be related:   There is another more likely cause of the AE  
• Possibly related:  The AE could have been due to the investigational drug  
• Probably related:   The AE is probably attributable to the investigational drug 
• Definitely related:   The AE is most likely attributable to the investigational drug 
 9.6 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  Any AE ( with the exception of worsening HS symptoms or injection site reactions) of grade [ADDRESS_490612] be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event.  All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_490613] should be made and recorded 
on the SAE form. The immediate and follow -up reports should identify subjects by [CONTACT_390921]' names, personal identification numbers, and/or addr esses. The Investigator should also submit SAEs to the IRB /EC according to 
their IRB /EC guidelines [ICH -GCP E6].  Drug -related Serious Adverse Events will be reported to 
the FDA by [CONTACT_12913]’s Medical Safety Officer according to 21 CFR 312.32.  9.7 REFERENCE SAFETY INFORMATION:  POTENTIAL ADVERSE  REACTIONS  
[ADDRESS_490614] been treated using bermekimab  in patients with advanced solid tumors, advanced 
hematologic malignancies, metastatic colorectal cancer, peripheral vascular disease, type II diabetes, acne vulgaris, plaque psoriasis, and pyoderma gangrenosum.  Over 1200 doses of bermekimab  were administered at 7.5 mg/kg to refractory, metastatic CRC patients with cancer 
associated symptoms at baseline (ECOG performance status 1 and 2).  In this trial (PT026), which is the largest controlled trial completed with bermekimab  to date (N=309), patients were dosed at 
7.5 mg/kg for metastatic colorectal cancer.  The most common AEs reported (>10%) were abdominal pain, peripheral edema, fatigue, anemia, constipation, decrease in weight, asthenia, decreased appetite, and nausea.  The majority of these events were grade 1 or 2 and appeared to be related to the underlying CRC.  The prevalence of these events was similar in the bermekimab  and 
placebo groups.  Two infusion reactions were reported in this trial, and they were not serious or severe (grade I or II).  
 Bermekimab  is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human interleukin-
1α (IL-1α).  As such, it is an immunomodulator that has anti -inflammatory and anti -neoplastic 
properties.  Other agents that could be considered in the same pharmacologic class include biologic agents that target IL -[ADDRESS_490615]

PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.[ADDRESS_490616] some minor residual component from the manufacturing process (i.e. host cell proteins).  To date, there has been a very low incidence of inject ion site or infusion reactions observed (20 patients out of 831 total; 2.4%).  All except two of 
these patients had grade [ADDRESS_490617] be ensured.  Pre -
medication with antihistamines or corticosteroids is not required.  
 For the purposes of expedited safety re porting in clinical trials, the following should be 
considered expected events:  
 
• Infusion Related Reactions 
• Injection Site Reactions 
 10.  STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. The SAP may be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol, and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect planned analyses.   
Analysis variables are listed in Section 8.  
 10.[ADDRESS_490618] 2018                                             PAGE 42 of 50 
 10.3 Analysis Sets  
10.3.1 Safety Analysis Sets  
The safety analysis set (SAF) consists of all patients that receive at least one dose of study medication and will be analyzed as treated.  
 The secondary endpoints will be analyzed based upon the SAF, as well as the per protocol popula tion (PP).  The per protocol population will consist of those patients that complete both the 
baseline (visit 1)  and visit 13  assessments of their hidradenitis ( HISCR, PGA, Modified Sartorius, 
VAS, and DLQI ). 
 10.4 Patient Disposition A listing of all patients prematurely discontinued from the study, along with reasons for discontinuation will be provided. In addition, the total number of patients for each of the following categories will be summarized.  
• The total number of screened patients: met the inc lusion criteria regarding the target  
indication and signed the informed consent  
• The total number of enrolled patients: met all inclusion/exclusion criteria and receive at least one dose of therapy 
• The analysis sets (SAF , PP) 
• The total number of patients who discontinued the study, and the reasons for  
discontinuation 
• A listing of patients prematurely discontinued from treatment, along with reasons for  
discontinuation  
10.5 Statistical Methods  
Continuous data will be summarized for each treatment group using the number of observations available (N), means, standard deviation (SD), minimums, medians, and maximums.  Categorical data will be summarized for each treatment group using counts and percentages.  Missing data will not be categorized in the summaries.  
10.5.[ADDRESS_490619] one dose of study medication. A summary of safety  results will be presented 
for each treatment group.  [IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Adverse Events  
Adverse events reported in this study will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding dictionary (version 21.0 or newer) . Coding will be to lowest level 
terms. The verbatim text, the PT, and the primary SOC will be listed in patient listings.   
 Pre-treatment AEs are defined as those that develop or worsen in severity from the time the patient 
provides informed consent, prior to the first dose of study drug.  Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that develop or worsen in severity following the first dose of study drug through the last study visit.  
 TEAEs  will be grouped by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) within 
SOC  and will be presented for each treatment group. The number and percent of subjects reporting 
at least one adverse event by [CONTACT_390922] A & B . The number and 
percentage of patients experiencing AEs and TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_12917] (SAEs), severity (grades 1 -5), SOC, and PT.

10.5.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints : 
Proportion of  patients achieving a positive Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) 
score after 1 3 weeks  will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] (and pooled overall population). The 
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the point estimate will be provided.  Subjects 
previ ously enrolled in  the 200mg/weekly dosing cohort  who have received two or fewer  
bermekimab injections  (2 x 200mg doses) before beginning the 400mg weekly doses will be 
included for data analysis together with those receiving all doses at 400mg /weekly. Patients who 
have received more than 2 bermekimab injections of 200mg may enter the 400mg/week arm;  
however, only patients who have received two or fewer  bermekimab injections will be included in 
the data analysis.  Change in outcomes from baseline to week 13 (VAS for disease, VAS for pain, DLQI, inflammatory lesion count, PGA, Disease Activity Score, and modified Sartorius score)  will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum value). The 95% CI of the mean change from baseline will be provided.   A rank- ordered analysis will be performed for the to tal abscess and inflammatory nodule count  
(ranked at 0, 1 or 2) and reduction in pain score ( categorized as ≥30% reduction on pain score 
among patients with baseline score of ≥3 ). The change in modified Sartorius  score will be 
dichotomized at 4 (≤[ADDRESS_490621] s evere disease, higher indicates severe disease). Number and percent 
under each treatment group (and pooled overall) will be summarized. 10.5.4 Pharmacodynamics (PK) analysis: Descriptive statistics of PK parameters will be presented in a table format. The summary will include average bermekimab  concentration at visit cycles along with the standard deviation and 
coefficient of variation (CV).

 11.3 PROTOCOL MODIFICATIONS  
Modifications of the signed protocol are only possible by [CONTACT_219829].  The procedure for approval of a protocol amendment is identical to that for approval of the protocol.  The IRB/EC must be informed of all protocol amendments and sho uld be asked for its opi[INVESTIGATOR_12879] a full re -evaluation of the ethical 
aspects of the study is necessary by [CONTACT_942].  This should be fully documented.  The Investigator must not implement any deviation from or change to the protocol, without discussion with an agreement by [CONTACT_390925]/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_12880]/EC, except where it is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects, or where the change(s) involves only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in CRA(s), change of telephone number(s)). Protocol amendments will be submitted to the appropriate authority(ies) as required by [CONTACT_8146](s).  
 11.[ADDRESS_490626] has given an IRB/EC approved informed consent.  The subject must give written consent after the receipt of detailed information.  The verbal explanation will cover all the elements specified in the written information provided for the subject.  The Investigator will inform the subject of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards 
of the study, including any discomfort it may entail.  The subject must be given every opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand and if necessary, ask for more information.  At the end of the interview, the subject may be given t ime to reflect if this is required, or if the subject 
requests more time.  Subjects and/or legal guardian forms will be kept and archived by [CONTACT_12927]'s study file.  It should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to withd raw their consent to participate at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled.  Subjects who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent may not be included or continued in this study, but this will not impact their subsequent care.  The Investigator will notify in writing each subject’s primary care physician (or equivalent) of the subject’s intent to participate in the study.  
 11.[ADDRESS_490627] ensure that each participant’s anonymity will be maintained in accordance with applicable laws. On eCRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor, subjects should not be identified by [CONTACT_12928], but by [CONTACT_12929].  The Investigator should k eep a separate log of ID numbers, names and 
addresses.  Documents that contain the names associated with these ID numbers (e.g., written consent/assent forms), are not for submission to the Sponsor and should be maintained by [CONTACT_390926], auditing or monitoring by [CONTACT_4707]/EC, the Sponsor personnel or their affiliates and designees (such as CRAs).

    2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Study Disease (s) 
Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second cause of cancer 
death in women in the Unites States [1]. Approximately, 15% of t hese cancers are classified as 
triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC), comprising those with absent expression of estrogen 
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2)[ 2].  
Hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_908256], and the 
monoclonal antibody trastuzumab is effective only for tumors that have amplified HER2 genes.  
The basal -like tumor s have a poor prognosis relative to other subtypes, even with the best available 
chemotherapy.  TNBCs have an aggressive nature with higher rates of relapse and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer [3]. Little progress 
has been made in identifying specific molecular pathways that exist fo r this tumor subtype ; 
because of this dismal prognosis, new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_908257].  
 2.2 The PD -1/PD -L1 pathway in cancer 
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades [Schreiber  et al. , Schreiber, 2012] . Accumulating 
evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and 
favorable prognosis in various malignancies [Mlecnik  et al. , 2014] .  In particular, the presence of 
CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory  T-cells seems to correlate 
with improved prognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors [Tosolini  et al. , 2006, 
Adams  et al. , 2014, Denkert  et al. , 2015]. 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275076] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells 
under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, 
including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1 ) is an Ig superfamily member 
related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen rec eptor 
signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2).  The structure of murine PD -1 
has been resolved.  PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing 
an Ig Variable- type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which 
is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 
tyrosine- based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and 
an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_1275077] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971].  PD-1 was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells.  Expression 
has also been shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well 
as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells.  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non- hematopoietic 
tissues as well as in various tumors.  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC- like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions 
with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_1275078] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only 
detectably expressed on antigen -presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory 
environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas 
PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy 
organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant 
levels of this T -cell inhib itor.  PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion 
in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  This suggests that the PD -1/PD- L1 pathway plays a critical 
role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therap eutic 
intervention[ Intlekofer  et al. , 2013]. 
 
The PD -1/PD- L1 pathway in breast cancer  
Unlike melanoma and NSCLC, BC has not been intensively investigated for its 
susceptibility to immunotherapy in clinical settings. However, there are accumulating preclinica l 
and clinical evidence suggesting that immune system is critical during natural history of breast cancer and the immun e system can be modulated to improve outcomes in this disease[ Kroemer  et 
al., 2015]. It has been recognized that BC is capable of stimulating the immune system, as many 
breast tumors have substantial lymphocyte infiltration  [Denkert  et al. , 2010 , Denkert  et al. , 2015] . 
Additionally, this pathologic feature has prognostic implications, as lymphocyte predominant breast cancers are associated with improved prognosis  [Denkert  et al. , 2010, Loi et al. , 2013]. 
However, the degree of immune infiltration differs by [CONTACT_908290]; while a substantial proportion of triple negative BC can be richly infiltrated, hormone -receptor positive BC is poorly T -cell 
infiltrated [Dushyanthen  et al. , 2015]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the expression of 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275079] tumors subtype:  HR-positive (30% PD -1; 33% PD -L1), 
triple -negative (70% PD -1; 59% PD -L1) and HER2- positive (60% PD -1; 20% PD -L1)[Gatalica  et 
al., 2014]. 
 
2.3 Nivolumab 
Nivolumab is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-
1 with nanomolar affinity (KD = 3.06 nM) and a high degree of specificity, thus precluding binding to its ligands PD -L1 and PD -L2. Nivolumab does not bind other related family members, such as 
BTLA, CTLA -4, ICOS or CD28. Pre- clinical testing of nivolumab demonstrated that b lockade of 
PD-1 results in enhanced T cell proliferation and exp ression of interferon -gamma (IFN -γ). 
2.3.1 Nivolumab nonclinical toxicology  
Toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys revealed that nivolumab was well tolerated at 
doses up to 50 mg/kg given twice weekly  for 27 doses. Drug related findings were limited to a 
reversible decrease in triiodothyronine (T3) by 28%, without concomitant abnormalities in other markers of thyroid function. Preliminary new non- clinical safety findings of adverse pregnancy 
outcomes a nd infant losses in the absence of overt maternal toxicity have been reported.
66 The 
findings of increased late stage pregnancy loss and early infant deaths/euthanasia in nivolumab exposed pregnant monkeys suggest a potential risk to human pregnancy if there is continued treatment with nivolumab during pregnancy. 
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1275080] advanced combination under development is nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_908258]. Thus far, the combination of both agents results in a safety profile with similar types of AEs as either agent alone, but in some cases with greater frequency.  
Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy as well as combination therapy is 
manageable and generally consistent across completed and ongoing clinical trials with no MTD reached at any dose tested, up to 10 mg/kg. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or 
causality of AEs to nivolumab dose level. Most AEs were low grade (grade 1 to grade 2) with relatively few related high grade (grade 3 to grade 4) AEs. Most high grade events were manageable with the use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy for Endocrinopathies. Management algorithms including the use of immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids, infliximab, etc., are provided in Section of this protocol. Nivolumab should not be used in subjects 
with active autoimmune disease given the mechanism of action of the antibody.

Cabozantini b is a new chemical entity that inhibits multiple RTKs with growth -promoting 
and angiogenic properties. The primary targets of cabozantinib are RET, MET, VEGFR2/KDR, and KIT (see below)

Cabozantinib is a n oral receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor, with multiple targets related to 
tumor growth  and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment, including MET, and 
VEGFR2/KDR  [Scagliotti et al ., 2013] . Both high tumor microvessel density and elevated 
vascular endothelial growth factor -A (VEGF -A) expression are associated with decreased relapse-
free and overall survival in early stage breast cancer,  suggesting that angiogenesis is associated 
with a poor prognosis  [Relf et al., 1997, Uzzan et al., 2004]. More  importantly, it is well known 
that bevacizumab (an anti -VEGF monoclonal antibody) in combination with chemotherapy has 
been associated with an improvement in  the rates of  complete pathological response in the 
neoadjuvant setting and with a significant improvement in progression- free survival (PFS) in 
several clinical studies, although it has not prolonged OS in patients with breast cancer  [Robert et 
al., 2011] . It has been recognized that inhibition of VEGF signaling alone, although initially 
effective in slowing tumor growth, often culminates in  the emergence of an evasive resistance

12 phenotype that ultimately promotes tumor invasiveness and metastasis  [Sennino, 2012]. One of 
the potential causes of resistance to anti -angiogenic inhibitors is the overexpression of MET  and 
of its ligand - hepatocyte grow factor ( HGF ); which have been asso ciated with tumor hypoxia, 
increased invasiveness and metastasis, and reduced survival in metastatic breast cancer  [Raghav 
et al., 2012]. Specifically, in patients with TNBC, MET expression is elevated and associated with 
poorer prognosis  [Ho-Yen et al., 2014, Zagouri et al., 2013]. In this context, cabozantinib an oral 
bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including 
VEGFR -2, was thought to be a drug to be evaluate d in combination with anti -PD1 drugs in patients 
with TNBC.  We completed a phase II trial  evaluating the efficacy of cabozantinib monotherapy in 
heavily pre- treated patients with mTNBC  [Tolaney et al. , 2016]. They reported a clinical benefit 
rate of 34%, including 9% of partial response rate.  
In vivo  data from pharmacodynamic experiments show that cabozantinib inhibits key RTKs 
that promote tumor cell proliferation, migration  and/or angiogenesis (RET, MET, and VEGFR2). 
In xenograft ed tumor models, cabozantinib inhibited VEGFR2 phosphorylation in lung tis sue, 
with an ED 50 of 26 mg/kg. The duration of action for cabozantinib was sustained with >  50 % 
inhibition observed 10-[ADDRESS_1275081]-dose at a dose level of 100 mg/kg for all targets studied.  
Treatment with cabozantinib shows rapid effects on the tumor endothelium, resulting in 
breakdown of the vasculature beginning [ADDRESS_1275082] cancer, human lung carcinoma, and rat glioblastoma. Overall, the data generated in vivo  demonstrate that the target profile of cabozantinib translates to potent 
anti-angiogenic activity and potent anti- tumor efficacy.  
 
2.4.1 Cabozantinib Nonclinical Toxicology 
In nonclinical toxicity studies in rodents and non- rodents, histopathological changes 
associated with cabozantinib adminis tration were observed in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone 
marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adrenal, and reproductive tract tissues. Histopathological changes present in bone and pancreas were considered secondary to cabozantinib administration. 
Cabozantinib was negative in in vitro  bacterial, in vitro  mammalian cell, and in vivo  mammalian 
genotoxicity bioassays. In reproductive toxicity studies , cabozantinib was embryotoxic in rats, 
produced fetal soft tissue changes in rabbits, and decreased fertility in male and female rats.  
Safety pharmacology studies of cabozantinib administration did not demonstrate adverse 
effects on neurobehavioral or respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -system function in rats; furthermore, no significant 
changes in electrocardiographic parameters (including corrected QT [QTc] interval) were observed by [CONTACT_151983]. 
Cabozantinib was not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 in vitro and is not 
predicted to have significant effects on CYP3A4 induction. Cabozantinib was shown to be an 
inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2C19 isozyme, in  vitro  and was also a substrate of 
CYP3A4 -mediated metabolism. The mean plasma protein binding by [CONTACT_908291] 98%.

As of 29 February 2016, the incidence of Grade 5 AEs from the pooled single -agent studies 
was 10.5% (254 subjects). The Grade [ADDRESS_1275085] frequency (≥ 1% 
incidence) were prostate cancer (2.9%) and general physical health deterioration (1.0%). Per convention, prostate cancer was the PT for disease progression of the cancer under study for Studies XL184- 203 (CRPC cohorts), XL184- 306, and XL184- 307. Only one event of general 
physical health deterioration (on Study XL184- 307) was asses sed as related to study treatment; no 
events of prostate cancer were assessed as related to study treatment.  
Thirty -three (33) of the 254 subjects with Grade 5 AEs had events assessed as related to 
the study treatment. The only related Grade 5 AEs that occurred more than once were pulmonary embolism (n=4), death (unspecified; n=3), hemorrhage (n=2), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (n=2), and sudden death (n=2).

2.4.3 Clinical Activity  
 Efficacy in Phase 3 Clinical Trials  
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Cell Carcinoma: Study XL184 -308 (METEOR; N=658)  
The population, enrollment, and study design of XL184- [ADDRESS_1275087]/MRI per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and to have received treatment with at 
least one prior VEGFR- TKI. Tumor assessments were evaluated by [CONTACT_908292]/or progression. Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either cabozantinib (60 mg, tablet formulation ) or everolimus (10 mg) which was the standard of care for the second-
line setting at the time of the initiation of the study.  
It was estimated that [ADDRESS_1275088] 375 subjects randomized were included in the population for the primary PFS 
analysis (Primary Endpoint Intent -to-Treat [PI[INVESTIGATOR_118059]] population). The results of the analysis 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS per IRC for subjects in the 
cabozantinib arm (n=187) compared with the everolimus arm (n=188): the HR adjusted for stratification factors was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.74; stratified log -rank p- value < 0.0001). The 
Kaplan -Meier estimates for median duration of PFS were 7.4 months in the cabozantinib arm vs 
3.8 months in the everolimus arm. Kaplan- Meier estimates of the percent of subjects event -free at 
6- and 12-month landmarks after treatment randomization were higher for the cabozantinib arm 
than for the everolimus arm (6 months: 55% cabozantinib, 34% everolimus; 12 months: 29%, 15%). The PFS analysis was repeated in the ITT population (658 subjects), and results w ere similar 
to those obtained for the PI[INVESTIGATOR_908259]. The HR adjusted for stratification factors was 0.51 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.62).  
A pre -specified interim analysis of OS was conducted for the ITT population as of the 22 
May 2015 database cutoff, at the time  of the primary analysis of PFS. There were a total of 202 
deaths (89 cabozantinib, 113 everolimus) by [CONTACT_908293], representing 49% (202/408) of the total required for the pre -specified primary analysis of OS. The minimum time of follow -up (from 
randomizati on of the last subject through 22 May 2015) was 5.9 months. The interim analysis 
demonstrated a strong trend for improvement in duration of OS for subjects in the cabozantinib arm compared with the everolimus arm: the HR, adjusted for stratification factor s was 0.68 (95%

18 CI: 0.51, 0.90; stratified log- rank p-value = 0.006). The OS results nearly met the criteria required to 
reject the null hypothesis at the interim analysis; the critical p -value was ≤ 0.0019 (HR ≤ 0.645).  
Following these results, in August  [ADDRESS_1275089] randomized. The second interim OS analysis with 13 
months of follow -up demonstrated a highly statistically significant prolongation of OS for subjects 
in the cabozantinib arm compared with the everolimus arm: the HR, adjusted for stratification 
factors was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.83; stratified log -rank p- value 0.0003). The c ritical value for 
rejecting the null hypothesis at the current analysis was p<0.0163. Kaplan- Meier estimates for 
median duration of OS were 21.4 months in the cabozantinib arm and 16.5 months in the everolimus arm. The proportion of subjects estimated to be alive by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier analysis was 
greater among subjects in the cabozantinib arm compared with everolimus at each time point. The respective landmark estimates of survival were 73% and 63% at 12 months and 58% and 47% at [ADDRESS_1275090] PFS -censoring dates were excluded from 
this analysis. The ORR in the ITT population for the cabozantinib and everolimus arms, 
respectively, was 17% (95% CI: 13, 22) and 3% (95% CI: 2, 6) (unstratified p- value < 0.0001). 
All responses were PRs. Of note there was a low incidence in the cabozantinib arm of PD as best response (12% vs 27%) which indicates a low incidence of primary refractory disease with cabozantinib in this study population. 
In conclusion, cabozantinib demonstrated a robust and statistically significant 
improvement in PFS, OS, and ORR in a Phase 3 trial for subjects with advanced RCC in the second -line setting.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Medullary Thyroid Cancer: Study XL184-301 (EXAM; N=330)  
Subjects were required to have radiographically documented disease progression by 
[CONTACT_100694] (mRECIST) compared with a radiologic assessment performed within the previous 14 months. Tumor assessments were evaluated  by [CONTACT_908294]/or progression. 
The estimated median PFS was 11.2 months for cabozantinib versus 4.0 months for placebo 
(HR 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.40; p < .001). Prolonged PFS with cabozantinib was observed across 
all subgroups including by [CONTACT_654], prior TKI treatment, and RET mutation status (hereditary or sporadic). Kaplan- Meier estimates of subjects alive and progression -free at 1 year are 47.3% for 
cabozantinib and 7.2% for placebo. 
Patient subgroups harboring any RET mutation, the RET M918T mutation, or no RET 
mutation all demonstrated an HR of less than 1, indicating benefit of cabozantinib treatment; however, the upper bound for the 95% CI for RET mutation negative subjects exceeded 1.  
The final analysis of the secondary endpoint of OS included 218 events (217 were required) 
and showed a trend for increased survival in the cabozantinib arm. The estimated median OS for the cabozantinib arm was 26.6 months versus 21.1 months for the placebo arm (HR = 0.85; 95% 
CI 0.64, 1.12; p = 0.2409). 
Because MTC is a relatively rare disease, this study was not designed to be large enough 
to provide high power to detect the minimum clinic ally meaningful difference in the secondary 
endpoint of OS. Instead, the study size was chosen to provide reasonable power (80%) for a large 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/2019  
 
19 (50%) improvement in OS (HR 0.667; improved median from 22 to 33 months). The final analysis 
was consistent with an alyses at information fractions of 75%, 85%, and 90% which included 162, 
185, and 196 of the required 217 deaths respectively. The consistency of the OS results at different information fractions supports the conclusion that although not statistically significant, the trend in increased survival with cabozantinib treatment did not likely arise by [CONTACT_3364].  
The subgroup analysis of subjects with a RET M918T mutation revealed a larger 
improvement in OS for the cabozantinib arm: the median OS was 44.3 months for the cabozantinib arm versus 18.9 months for the placebo arm (HR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.38, 0.94; p = 0.0255 not adjusted for multiple subgroup analyses . In the current study 126 subjects or 38% had RET M918T 
mutation (the majority of which were somatic mutatio ns), representing 54% of 233 subjects whose 
RET M918T status was known. 
The analysis of tumor response among subjects with measurable disease at baseline was 
conducted at the time of the primary analysis of PFS. The ORRs per IRC were 28% (95% CI: 21.9%, 34.5%) and 0% for subjects in the cabozantinib and placebo arms, respectively. All responses were PRs, no subjects in either treatment group had a confirmed CR. The p- value from 
the stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test was highly significant (p < 0.0001). The median 
duration of objective responses was 14.6 months (95% CI: 11.1, 17.5) for subjects in the cabozantinib arm. The median duration of the best overall response (BOR) of SD, as determined by [CONTACT_26732], was 10.8 months (95% CI: 8.3, 11.2) for the cabozantinib arm compared with 5.7 months (95% CI: 5.6, 8.4) for the placebo arm. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Castration -Resistant Prostate Cancer  
Study XL184-307 (COMET-1; N=1023)  
The study enrolled subjects with advanced CRPC with bone metastases. The prespecified 
primary analysis of  the primary endpoint (OS) was based on an ITT analysis of all randomized 
subjects. The analysis included 614 events (578 were required) and did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in OS for subjects in the cabozantinib arm compared with the prednisone arm: the HR, adjusted for prior cabazitaxel use, baseline Brief Pain Inventory (BPI; Item 3) score, and baseline ECOG performance status was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.06; stratified logrank p- value 0.213). The  Kaplan -Meier estimates for median  duration of OS were 11.0 months 
in the cabozantinib arm and 9.8 months in the prednisone arm, an estimated 1.2 month difference in the medians.  The secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with a BSR per IRC at Week 12. BSR was defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in total bone -scan lesion area compared 
with baseline without soft -tissue disease progression. The analysis demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in the cabozantinib arm compared with the prednisone arm (42% vs 3%; stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel [CMH] p -value < 0.001). The median duration of BSR was 
5.8 vs 1.8 months. Median PFS per Investigator was 5.6 months in the cabozantinib arm and 2.8 months in the prednisone arm. The HR adjusted for randomization stratification factors was 0.48 
(95% CI 0.40, 0.57; stratified logrank p-value < 0.0001).
 
  
Study XL184-306 (COMET-2; N=119)  
The study enrolled subjects with advanced CRPC with bone metastases. Enrollment was 
stopped before the planned study population size of 246 was reached; a total of 119 subjects were 
enrolled. The primary analysis for the ITT population (n=119) did not demonstrate an 
improvement in the proportion of subjects with a pain response at Week 6 confirmed at Week 12 in the cabozantinib arm compared with the mitoxantrone plus prednisone arm; the proportions of

20 subjects experiencing a confirmed pain response were 15% and 17% for the two arms, respectively. 
The secondary endpoints were BSR per IRC and OS. BSR was defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in total bone -scan lesion area compared  with baseline without soft -tissue disease progression. The 
analysis of BSR per IRF at Week [ADDRESS_1275091] 1.1 demonstrated a greater improvement in the cabozantinib arm (31%; 95% CI: 20%, 43%) compar ed

2.5 Rationale Recognizing that overexpression of immune checkpoint molecules in the tumor 
microenvironment has a critical role for antitumor immunity evasion and for cancer progression has revolutionized cancer treatment [4]. In particular, anti -PD-1/PD- L1 antibodies have 
demonstrated clinical activity in more than 15 cancer types and two PD -1 inhibitors (nivolumab

21 and pembrolizumab) are FDA approved for treatment of advanced melanoma, non- small- cell lung 
carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma[ 5-7]. More than 1,000 clinical trials of checkpoint blockers 
are currently ongoing.  
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), ha ve revolutionized cancer therapy for pati ents with 
advanced solid tumors [ Leach et al., 1996, Pardoll, 2012, Freeman et al., 2000]. A large body  of  
preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that the immune system can recognize and fight 
against breast cancer  [Kroemer et al., 2015, Savas et al., 2015] . It is now recognized that a fraction 
of breast tumors, especially TNBC, have substa ntial lymphocyte infiltration and that this 
pathologic feature has prognostic implications [Savas et al. , 2015]. Furthermore, the high rates of 
PD-L1 and PD -1 expression in patients with TNBCs led to clinical trials to address the role of PD -
1 blockers in this population [Gatalica et al.,  2014]. 
The recently presented KEYNOTE [ADDRESS_1275093] study evaluating the efficacy of 
PD-1 inhibitors (Pembrolizumab given in monotherapy; flat dose of 200mg every 3 weeks) in 
patients with mTNBC showed different outcomes based on the number of  previous lines of 
therapy: cohort A included 170 patients who had received ≥1 prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, and showed an objective response rate of 4.7% (2% - 9%) [Adams et al., 2015]  ; Perhaps , 
more important is the duration of response with the PD -1 inhibitor s in patients with mTNBC : 6.3 
months; with more than 5 (63%) responders without progression of disease at study data cut off; 
cohort B included 52 patients no prior systemic anticancer therapy for metastat ic disease, and 
showed an objective response rate of 23% (14% - 36%) [Adams et al.,  2017]. While checkpoint 
blockade show s activity in  a subset of m TNBC, these results suggest that there must be additional 
immunosuppressive factors causing resistance to im munotherapy in this population, and other 
agents must be added to anti -PD-1/PD- L1 treatment in order to enhance the benefit of 
immunotherapy in TNBC.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_908260], an increasing body of 
preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the interaction with the immune system is critical 
for disease outcome in this disease as well [8]. It is now recognized that a fraction of breast tumors, 
especially TNBC, have substantial lymphocyte infiltration and that this pathologic feature has prognostic implications [9]. Furthermore, the high rates of PD-L1 and PD-1 expression in patients 
with TNBCs led to clinical trials to address the role of PD -1 blockers in this population[ 10]. The 
anti-PD-L1 atezolizumab was evaluated in patients with metastatic TNBC PD -L1 positive and 
showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 19% and a  6-month PFS of 27% [11]. Similar results 
were found in a PD -L1 positive population with the anti -PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizuamb (ORR of 
18% and 6- month PFS of 23%) [12]. Data from a trial with avalumab has demonstrated that in a 
non-selected population, the use of PD -1/PD- L1 inhibitors presented an objective response rate 
(ORR) of 8.6%[ 13].  
Clearly, these results show that, while checkpoint blockade may show activity in TNBC, 
other agents must be added to anti -PD-1/PD- L1 treatment in order to enhance the benefit. In 
addition, the fact that the majority of patients with advanced canc er, including TNBC, still do not 
derive clinical benefit from these drugs suggests that additional immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment have a role in de novo resistance to these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Some of these mechanisms have been ident ified, and now provide targets for combination therapy [14]. In 
this context, vascular endothelial growth factor -A (VEGF -A), the key molecule in tumor 
angiogenesis, has been recognized as a critical mediator of tumor immune suppression[ 15]. In 
addition to its role in angiogenesis, VEGF modulates anti- tumor immunity on multiple levels, 
including promotion and expansion of inhibitory immune cell subsets, such as T regulatory cells 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/2019  
 
22 (Tregs) and myeloid -derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) 
maturation, mitigation of effector T cell responses, and alteration of lymphocyte development and 
trafficking [16]. Consequently, targeting angiogenesis may be an effective strategy to increase the 
efficacy of primarily T cell -directed immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint blockade [ 17]. 
Recently, Voron at al. showed in a mouse model that that VEGF-A produced in the tumor 
microenvironment enhances expression of PD -1 and other inhibitory checkpoints mediating CD8+ 
T cell exhaustion, which could be reverted by [CONTACT_908295] -angiogenic agents (anti -VEGF -A 
antibody or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as sunitinib, which target VEGF receptor family member (VEGFR). The administration of masatinib, a TKI that does not target VEGFR, was not able to revert the PD -L1 overexpression 
VEGF -induced (Figure 1). Importantly, the authors demonstrated in vitro that the expression of 
PD-1 on CD8+ T cells is induced by [CONTACT_12270] -A in a VEGFR -2-dependent manner, but is not 
VEGFR -1-dependent. Because anti –VEGF -A treatment decreased PD -1 expression on 
intratumoral CD8+ T cells but does not fully restore the steady -state level of PD -1 expression 
(Figure 2a), the authors hypothesized that VEGF -A blockade could he lp to sensitize T cells to 
anti–PD-1 antibody treatment in some tumors. Interestingly, anti– PD-[ADDRESS_1275094] only in VEGF -deleted tumor -bearing mice and not in wild -type tumor -
bearing mice (Fig. 2b), suggesting that VEGF produced by [CONTACT_908296]–PD-1–induced antitumor effects. Next, the 
authors combined anti -VEGF -A antibody 
with anti–PD -1 antibody in a CT26 mouse 
model of colorectal cancer expressing high levels of VEGF -A. Anti –VEGF -A 
treatment reduced tumor growth, and anti –
PD-[ADDRESS_1275095], but the anti –VEGF -A and anti –PD-[ADDRESS_1275096] as compared with anti –VEGF -A 
alone or anti -PD-1 alone (Fig. 2c). This 
result suggests that high VEGF -A levels 
may be involved in resistance to anti –PD-1 
treatments and that antiangiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_908261] -A–VEGFR -2 could 
synergize with anti –PD-1 treatment 
strategies and enhance anti –PD-1–
dependent antitumor effects. 
 In the clinical setting, a phase I 
study u sing bevacizumab (anti -VEGF 
antibody) plus the immune checkpoint ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (anti- CTLA4) conducted in patients with 
advanced melanoma showed an objective partial response rate of 17%  and  a disease control rate 

 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/2019  
 
23 of 67% [18]. Currently, several clinical trials are evaluating the combination of immune checkpoint 
blockade and angiogenesis inhibition in cancer patients. 
Both high tumor microvessel density and elevated VEGF expression are associated with 
decreased relapse- free and OS in early stage BC, suggesting that angiogenesis is associated with a 
poor prognosis [19, 20]. Moreover, it is well known that bevacizumab in combination with 
chemotherapy has been associated with improvement in complete pathological response in 
neoadjuvant setting and with significantly improvement in progression -free survival (PFS) in 
several studies, although it has not prolonged OS in BC [ 21]. It has been recognized that inhibition 
of VEGF signaling alone, although initially effective in slowing tumor growth, often culminates in emergence of an evasive resistance phenotype that ultimately promotes tumor invasiveness and metastasis [22]. In this context, cabozantinib an oral bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of 
multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including VEGFR -2, seems to be a very interesting drug 
to evaluate in combination with anti -PD1 drugs in patients with TNBC. Another important 
property of cabozantinib is that it inhibits MET, a RTK  that promotes cell proliferation , invasion, 
and survival when activated by [CONTACT_890839], hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, also known as the “scatter  factor”) [23]. In vivo, besides its antiangiogenic effects, cabozantinib rapi[INVESTIGATOR_908262], resulting in tumor regression in various xenograft models. In addition, increased expression of MET has been implicated in the development of resistance to antiangiogenic drugs in preclinical models of several cancers [ 24]. More recently, Balan et al reported that the MET-
induced signaling promotes PD -L1 overexpression in renal cancer cells, establishing a link 
between MET pathway and antitumor immunity evasion [ 25].  
Of note, MET and HGF overexpression have been associated with tumor hypoxia, 
increased invasiveness and metastasis, and reduced survival in metastatic breast cancer  [26]. 
Specifically, in patients with TNBC, MET expression is elevated and associated with poorer prognosis [ 27, 28] . Preclinical data showed that cabozantinib synergizes with immunotherapy in 
different tumor mice models [Kwilas et al., 2014, Lu et al., 2017]. Recently, in a phase II trial, 
cabozantinib monotherapy demonstrated a clinical benefit rate of 34%, including 9% of partial response rate, in heavily pre -treated patients with mTNBC [29]. Furthermore, correlative studies 
performed in this trial showed: 1) high baseline plasma concentration of sMET was associated with longer PFS and tended to correlate with clinical benefit; 2) the concentration of plasma HGF was lower in patients with clinical benefit versus those without, though this association did not 
reach statistical significance; 3) cabozantinib treatment was associated with changes in biomarker concentrations that are consistent with anti -vascular effect s and increases in tissue hypoxia, i.e., 
increases in plasma CAIX, PlGF, VEGF and SDF1 α; 4) Flow cytometric analyses showed a 
significant and persistent increase in the fraction of circulating CD3+ T cells after cabozantinib therapy, which appeared to be d riven by [CONTACT_908297]4–/CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
(CTL) population, and a significant decrease in the CD14+ monocytic population, which is considered as an immunosuppressive myeloid population. These findings highlight the possibility that combi nations of cabozantinib with immunotherapy will improve the outcomes in this 
population. In the clinical setting, other groups including investigators at DF/Harvard Cancer 
Center have been explored the immunological effects of the combination of antiangiogenic drugs plus ICI. Two early phase trials showed an increase in the tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes rates in 
patients with melanoma and kidney cancer [Hodi et al., 2014, Wallin et al.,  2016]. Altogether, 
these data highlight the possibility that combinations of cabozantinib with immunotherapy will improve the outcomes in this population.

24 Based on the above rationale, we hypothesize that cabozantinib (by [CONTACT_908298]) will synergize with nivolumab (which will activate the CTLs), resulting in improvement 
of efficacy of immunotherapy. We propose to test this hypothesis by [CONTACT_908299] (anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody) in patients with metastatic 
TNBC in an open -label, single arm phase II study. The primary endpoint will be to evaluate the 
efficacy of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab, as defined by [CONTACT_20363] (ORR) according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1275097] of treatment on serum markers relevant to VEGF -VEGFR2 and 
HGF/ MET pathways, as well on immunologic biomarkers (plasma sVEGFR2, IL -2, IFN -γ, TNF -
α, sMET) in peripheral blood. In addition, research biopsies will be performed at baseline 
(mandatory if the lesion is accessible) and within 7-[ADDRESS_1275098] years, with clinical approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors [Sharma  et al. , 2015] . However, less than half of patients with solid tumors 
will derive benefit with the se drugs  [Hwu  et al. , 2012, Smith  et al. , 2012] . Thus, it is crucial to 
elucidate the exact mechanisms of antitumor immunity evasion ongoing in tumor microenvironment to successfully develop new cancer immunotherapy and correctly choose the best drug for the right patient. This goal can be pursuit through the discovery and validation of 
prognostic and predictive biomarkers.  A growing  body of evidence suggests that patients  with advanced  solid tumors shows  differences 
in tumor microenvironment regarding the presence or absence of a gene expression profile 
indicative of a pre -existing T -cell–inflamed tumor microenvironment[ Gajewski, 2015] . Tumors 
classified as T -cell inflamed present a significant infiltration of CD8+ T cells and a type I IFN 
signature. In this group, the main mechanisms of immune evasion are the overexpression of immunessupressor molecules acting at the level of the tumor micro - environment, such as immune 
checkpoint molecules (CTLA -4, PD -1/PD- L1, TIM -3, LA G-3), indoleamine -2,3-dioxygenase 
(IDO), and FoxP3. Interestingly, such immunosuppressive molecules seem to be upregulated after deflagration of a type I Interferon antitumor response, resulting in T -cell exhaustion, and the so 
called adaptive immune resis tance[ Gajewski, 2015, Ribas, 2015]. The other group of pat ients 
presents tumors characterized by a low or absence of intratumoral CD8 T cells and a lack evidence of a type I IFN transcriptional signature. This tumor phenotype is called non-T- cell-
inflamed [Gajewski, 2015]. 
 The T -cell inflamed phenotype has positive prognostic value for several types of early stage 
cancer, including breast cancer [Dushyanthen et al. , 2015, Perez  et al. , 2015 ], suggesting that the 
attempt by [CONTACT_908300] -tumor immune response reflects a biologic process 
assoc iated with improved patient outcomes [Gajewski, 2015] . In breast oncology, different groups 
have demonstrated that the amount of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in a tumor specimen, 
commonly assessed simply by [CONTACT_313845] a standard hematoxylin and eosin- stained 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275099], is a significant predictor of both response to therapy and overall 
disease outcomes in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings  [Denkert  et al. , 2010, Loi et al. , 2013, 
Adams  et al. , 2014, Ali et al. , 2014, Salgado  et al. , 2014, Denkert  et al. , 2015, Denkert  et al. , 
2015]. Recently, more in -depth methods of immunologic profiling are being explored in breast 
cancer, for example mRNA  expression of immune -activating and immunosuppressive factors, and 
these additional immune profiles also appear to have prognostic significance [Perez  et al. , 2015]. 
Furthermore, in metastatic setting, the phenotype T -cell-inflamed appears to be associated with 
clinical response to several immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including checkpoint blockade [Herbst  et al. , 2014]. 
Patients with this tumor phenotype seem to be good candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, alone or in combination. Thus, the bulk of our correlative science in this trial highlights our especial interest in characterize a broad array of immune markers in metastatic HR -positive 
breast cancer, investigating whe ther those markers predict disease response to therapy.  
 Thus, consider ing the mechanism of action of drugs like anti -PD-1/anti- PD-L1, is the lack of a 
signi ficant T -cell infiltr ate and low expression of immune checkpoint molecules may explain the 
reason t hat certain non inflamed tumor phenotype are associated with de novo resistance to those 
class of drugs. For this group of patients, therapeutic strategies that promote a n increase in 
cytotoxic T -cell infiltration, such as anti- angiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , will be crucial to successfully 
overcoming T- cell exclusion  and improve the likelihood of benefit of PD- [ADDRESS_1275100] majority of patient’ s tumors do not harbor 
significant TILs or  demonstrate  PD-L1 expressio n and will therefore  most likely be classified as 
non-T- cell-inflamed tumors. This may explains  why ORR recently reported in this  population 
ranges  from  2.8%-12%[ Dirix  et al. , 2015, Hugo  et al. , 2015] . Clearly, new approaches to boost 
antitumor immunity are needed in this population.  RT can potentially  improve the activity of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors. Because of the preclinical data supporting RT ind uced immune 
modulation of the tumor microenvironment , we intend to explor e how immune biomarkers change 
after the beginning of treatment, including the expression of immune checkpoint molecules, TILs and T-c ell receptor diversity . 
 Additionally, as a correlative study to this trial, we will characterize the immune marker profile of 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in enrolled breast cancer patients.  Furthermore , 
given the demonstrated clinical sign ificance of TILs in breast cancer specimens, we will 
investigate whether there is a peripheral marker whose level corresponds to TIL percentage.  Lastly, we will evaluate whether there is a correlation between changes in PBMC immune profiles and disease response.  Evidence of a correlation would be of significant interest as it would suggest the potential presence of a predictive biomarker in the peripheral blood.  These correlative projects are made possible by [CONTACT_313846]. Scott Rodig and Evisa

26 available systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], virtually all patients will die from their disease.  Thus, the 
exploration of new treatments, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), including nivolumab, is imperative.  
 An increasing body of preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that breast cancer is an immunogenic malignancy [Kroemer et al., 2015].  It is now recognized that a fraction of breast tumors, mainly triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC), have substantial lymphocyte infiltration, 
and that this pathologic fe ature has prognostic implications [Stanton, 2016].  Early clinical trials 
assessing the efficacy of PD -1/PD-L1 inhibitors given as monotherapy showed that only a small 
fraction of patients derive benefit from immunotherapy with an approximate 20% objective response rate (ORR) among patients with PDL1+ TNBC [Dirix et al., 2016, Nanda et al., 2016], and a 12% ORR among those with PDL1+ hormone receptor (HR)-positive BC [Rugo et al., 2016].  Therefore, new research approaches combining therapeutic agents aiming to boost antitumor immunity, as well as developi[INVESTIGATOR_313794], are needed to increase the rates of clinical success of immunotherapy in BC.  
 In this context, the gut microbiota has been recognized as a modulator of immune system development [Tinchieri, 2015]. Healthy individuals have microbial populations in their intestinal tract that vary markedly in composition [Human Microbiome Project, 2012, Qin et al. , 2010].  
The diversity of intestinal microbiota represents a significant challenge to the host’s immune defenses, which must balance immune tolerance of beneficial microbes with inflammatory responses against pathogens.  Alterations in the gut microbiota and their resulting interactions with intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_566134], including cancer [Roy et al. 2017].  Recently, two preclinical studies provided to ICI, raising the 
possibility that stool microbiota could be used as biomarker predictors of efficacy to immunotherapy
 [Sivan et al., 2015, Vetizou et al., 2015].  Interestingly, postmenopausal women 
with breast cancer have altered composition and low diversity of their gut microbiota compared to healthy controls [Goedert et al., 2015].  Identification of biomarkers that predict res ponse to ICI- based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_566135]-related adverse events.  In addition, the identification of bacterial species associated with response could open new strategies to maximize the clinical benefit of cancer immunotherapy through the modulation of gut microbiota.

tumor aneuploidy [Davoli  et al. , 2017] , mismatch repair defects [Le et al. , 2015] , and BRCA2

Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System 
(CTMS) OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of  protocol therapy. Any 
participant not registered to the protocol before protocol therapy  begins will be considered 
ineligible and registration will be denied.  
An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will 
complete the protocol- specific eligibility checklist.  
Following registration, participants  may begin protocol therapy. Issues that would cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investig ator (PI). If a participant 
does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the pa rticipant’s registration on the study  
must be canceled . Registration cancellations  must be made in OnCore as soon as possible.

 5.3 Agent administration  
On days when Nivolumab and Cabozantinib are administered on the same day (i.e. Day 1 of each cycle)  the order of agent administration does not matter. .   
 
5.3.1 Nivolumab Administration  
 Nivolumab is available as 100 mg vials (10 mg/mL), which include an overfill. It is 
supplied in 10 mL type I flint glass vials with butyl stoppers and aluminum seals. Nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted (10 mg/mL) or diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (USP to concentrations no less than 0.35 mg/mL) or 5% Dextrose .   
 Nivolumab will be administered every 28 days  at a dose of 480mg given intravenously 
over 30 minutes  (+/- 10 minutes)  using a volumetric pump with 0.2 to 1.2 micron pore size, low -
protein binding polyethersulfone membrane in- line filter.  
 
5.3.2 Cabozantinib administration 
 Cabozantinib will be  administered orally, once daily for 28 days at a dose of  40 mg.  
Cabozantinib should be taken 2 hours after a meal (water is permitted) with a full glass of water (8oz/240mL).  Participants should continue to fast for 1 hour after taking cabozantinib. Participant s 
will be provided with  dosing instructions , a drug diar y and a sufficient supply of cabozantinib for 
continuous daily dosing .  Cabozantinib should be dosed on an outpatient basis even on days where 
Nivolumab and Cabozantinib are dose together  (i.e. Day 1 of each cycle). While tak ing 
Cabozantinib, participants should avoid consumption of grapefruit and Seville oranges.  
 
 5.4 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
 
We will perform a safety run -in analysis on the first 6 participants enrolled to the trial. I f

 Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are outlined in Section 6.   5.5 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.5.1 Concomitant Medication Guidelines 
 Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275133]’s welfare may be administered 
at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_908264] . Selected medications of interest received within [ADDRESS_1275134] permanently discontinued cabozantinib treatment (refer to http://www.qtdrugs.org for a list of drugs which have the 
potential to prolong the QTc interval).  Every effort to avoid radiation therapy while participating on this protocol should be made; however, if it is of clinical necessity for the patient, the circumstances should be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_908265].   
Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_754409]: 
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Investigational agents other than nivolumab and cabozantinib  
• Any systemically active oral, injected, or implanted hormonal method of contraception except for progesterone coated intrauterine devices (IUDs) that had been previously implanted.  
• Estrogen replacement therapy.  
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_1275135] dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: 
measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, a nd typhoid vaccine. 
The use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluzones, BCG, and ty 
• Systemic glucocorticoids should be avoided for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from radiation or an event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  If corticosteroids are required for this purpose, the minimum effective dose should be used.  The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (10 mg prednisone daily 
or equivalent) can be used without principal investigator (PI)  auth orization.

• Concomitant anticoagulation with oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, direct 
thrombin and  Factor Xa inhibitors), platelet inhibitors (eg,  clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]) are prohibited. 
Note: Low -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_40527] (per local applicable guidelines) and low-
dose LMWH are permitted. Anticoagulation with therapeutic doses of LMWH is allowed.  
 
• Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically 
necessary.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927]- Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
5.5.2 Supportive Care Guidelines – general medications  
 
The following treatments are permitted throughout the duration of the study treatment phase and during follow-up:  
• Standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_4579] -existing medical conditions unless listed as prohibited t herapy. 
Any medication intended solely for supportive care (e.g., analgesics, anti -diarrheal, anti -
depressants) may be used at the investigator’s discretion.  Antiemetics and anti -diarrheal 
medications should not be administered prophylactically before ini tial treatment with study 
drugs.  At the discretion of the investigator, prophylactic antiemetic and anti- diarrheal 
medication(s) may be used as per standard clinical practice before subsequent doses of study drugs or before, during or after radiation trea tment. 
• Bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy to be used in accordance with the approved labeled indication and/or nationally recognized treatment guidelines.  Participants already receiving bisphosphonate/denosumab at the time of study entry can continue the  treatment.   
Participants may initiate treatment with bisphosphonate/denosumab after study entry with physician discretion.  
• Concomitant anticoagulation with oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, direct thrombin and  Factor Xa inhibitors), platelet inhibitors (eg,  clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]) are prohibited. 
Note: Low -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_40527] (per local applicable guidelines) and low-
dose LMWH are permitted. Anticoagulation with therapeutic doses of LMWH is allowed.  
• Pain medications administered per standard clinical practice are acceptable while the patient is enrolled in the study.  
 
Patients who experience toxicities should be treated symptomatically as clinically indicated.  Medications that are considered necessary for the subject’s welfare and that are not expected to interfere with the evaluation of study treatment or be restricted  may be given at the discretion of 
the investigator.   Ancillary treatments will be given as medically indicated.  
 Potential Drug Interactions: 
Cytochrome P450:  Preliminary data from a clinical drug interaction study (Study XL184 -
008) show that clinically relevant steady -state concentrations of cabozantinib appear to have no 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275136] lower [I]/Ki values compared to CYP2C8 ( i.e., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4).  In vitro data indicate that 
cabozantinib is unlikely to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible induction of CYP1A1 at high cabozantinib concentrations (30 μM).  
 Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate (but not a CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 substrate), based on 
data from in vitro studies using CYP-isozyme specific neutralizing antibodies.  
 Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184 -006, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resul ted in 
an approximately 80% reduction in cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers.  Co- administration of cabozantinib with strong inducers of the 
CYP3A4 family ( e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, 
phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) may significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations.  The chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided.  Other drugs that induce CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to decrease exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib ( e.g., chronic use of modafinil) should be avoided because of its potential to reduce 
cabozantinib exposure .  Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal 
CYP 3A4 enzyme induction potential is recommended.  In addition, caution must be used when 
discontinuing treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer in a subject who has been concurrently receiving a stable dose of cabozantinib, as this could significantly increase  the exposure to 
cabozantinib.  
 Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184 -007, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 33- 39% increase in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of 
cabozantinib in healthy volunteers.  Co- administration of cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of 
the CYP3A4 family ( e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, 
nelfinavir, and ritonavir)  may increase cabozantinib concentrations.  Grapefruit / grapefruit juice 
and Seville oranges may also increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to increase exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib. Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition potential is recommended.  
 Because in vitro studies only assessed the metabolizing capacity of t he CYP3A4, CYP2C9, 
and CYP2D6 pathways, the potential for drugs that inhibit/induce other CYP450 pathways ( e.g., 
CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP1A2) to alter cabozantinib exposure is not known.  Therefore, these drugs should be used with caution when given with cabozantinib.  
 Please refer to the Flockhart drug interaction tables for lists of substrates, inducers, and 
inhibitors of selected CYP450 isozyme pathways (Flockhart 2007; http://medic ine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx
).  
 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/2019  
 
40 Protein Binding:  Cabozantinib is highly bound ( ≥ 99.7%) to human plasma proteins. Therefore, 
highly protein bound drugs should be used with caution with cabozantinib because there is a 
potential displacement interaction that could increase free concentrations of cabozantinib and/or a co-administered hig hly protein-bound drug (and a corresponding increase in pharmacologic 
effect).  
 
In vitro data suggest that cabozantinib is unlikely to be a substrate for P glycoprotein (P -
gp), but it does appear to have the potential to inhibit the P-gp transport activity.  
 
Additional details related to these overall conclusions are provided in the Investigators 
Brochure . 
 
5.6 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off  Protocol Therapy  
 Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for an indefinite number of cycles, or until one of the following criteria applies:  
1. Disease progression  by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_1275137] attained a confirmed complete response ( CR) that have been 
treated for at least [ADDRESS_1275138] two treatments with 
nivolumab beyond the date when the initial CR was declared.   Participants  who stop 
nivolumab with CR may be eligible for additional nivol umab therapy if they progress 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262].  This retreatment is termed the Second Course Phase  
Therapy.  See additional details be low. 
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
 
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the medication regimen and/or documentation requirements 
 
• Participant decides  to withdraw from the protocol therapy 
 
• General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating investigator  
 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275139] be documented in the case report form (CRF)  and in the CTMS system (OnCore) . Alternative care 
options will be discussed with the participant.  
 In the event of unusual or life- threatening complications, treating investigators must immediately 
notify the Overall PI,  Sara Tolaney, phone: 617- 632-2335, or email: [EMAIL_3104].  
 Second Course Phase (Retreatment Period)  
 Participants may elect to stop nivolumab and cabozantinib with confirmed CR after at least [ADDRESS_1275140] meets the following conditions:  
o Stopped initial treatment with nivolumab and cabozantinib after attaining an 
investigator -determined   confirmed CR according to RECIST 1.1, w as treated for at 
least [ADDRESS_1275141] dose of 
nivolumab 
o meets all other study inclusion/exclusion criteria, as per Section 3. 
 
Subjects who restart treatment will be retreated at the same dose and dose interval as when they 
last received nivolumab .  Visit requirements are as outlined for subjects on the initial treatment 
phase of the trial.    5.7 Duration of Follow Up 
 Participants removed from protocol therapy for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.   
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275142] disease progression  event after removal from protocol therapy. 
 
Tumor assessments should continue to be performed every 6 -12 weeks  on these participants . 
  5.8 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study  
 Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria apply:  
• Disease Progression  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Withdrawal of consent for data submission 
• Death  
 The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was  removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF) and CTMS (OnCore).  6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Dose delays and modifications will be made as indicated in the following table(s). The 
descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI  Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for dose delays and dose modifications. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
 http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.  
 
 6.1 Dosing Delays/Omission/Modficiation  
 Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical 
reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or holidays). Participants held for these reasons require prior approval from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_908266] 6 weeks of the scheduled interruption. The reason for 
interruption should be documented in the participant's study record. 
 In the absence of an unacceptable therapy -related toxicity and/or clinical signs of disease 
progression, subjects may continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. S ubjects must  
be instructed to notify their physician immediately for any and all toxicities.  
 Subjects may hold each drug independently of one another and if one must permanently be 
discontinued, they may continue on the other.  
 Guidelines for the management of AE s (ie,  dose interruptions and dose reductions) are 
presented in the next sections. Cabozantinib and nivolumab have class -specific safety profiles 
based on their mechanism of action but may also cause AEs that overlap. For management of AEs 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/2019  
 
43 which c an be clearly attributed to Cabozantinib or Nivolumab, independent dose modification for 
either agent is allowed. For AEs without clear attribution to either study treatment, management 
of toxicity should include dose modifications of both agents. 
  Cabozantinib may only  be reduced by [CONTACT_30560]   (see Table 1 below).  If study 
treatme nt of cabozantinib is restarted after being withheld or interrupted, the subject should be 
instructed not to make up the missed doses of cabozantinib.  
 
Starting Dose  First Level dose Reduction  
40 mg cabozantinib  Reduce to 2 0 mg cabozantinib  
 
 
For toxicities that were considered unrelated to cabozantinib:  If the subject recovers from his 
or her toxicities to CTCAE v.4.0 Grade ≤  1 or to the baseline value (or lower), then treatment 
with cabozantinib may be restarted with no change in dose. 
Subjects unable to tolerate a daily dose of 20 mg should discontinue study treatment.  For dose reductions not triggered by [CONTACT_908303] 4 AEs affecting major 
organs (eg, central nervous system, cardiac, hepatic, renal)  dose re- escalation to the 
participants previous dose of cabozantinib (not higher than 40 mg/day) may be allowed after 
discussion with the PI. 
 There are no dose reductions for nivolumab.   Nivolumab should be held (delayed) or omitted for toxicities that are considered possibly, 
probably or definitely related to nivolumab.  Nivolumab doses may be delayed up to [ADDRESS_1275143], especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, is recommended.  
 
 Doses of nivolumab should be omitted (not delayed) for the following toxicities:  
• Any Grade 3  skin, drug- related adverse event  
• Grade 2 diarrhea or colitis 
• Grade 2 pneumonitis 
• Grade 2 hypophysitis 
• Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency  
• Serum creatinine more than 1.5 and up to 6 times the upper limit of normal 
• Grade 1 or 2 new- onset moderate or severe neurol ogic signs or

44 symptoms  
• Any grade 3 adverse event  
• First occurrence: omit dose

6.2 Management of toxicities attributable to Cabozantinib and Nivolumab 
 
6.2.1 Gastrointestinal Disorders  
 
Diarrhea/Colitis  
Subjects should be instructed to notify their physician immediately at the first signs of 
poorly formed or loose stool or an increased frequency of bowel movements as both cabozantinib and nivolumab can be associated with severe diarrhea/colitis . General supportive measures should 
be implemented including continuous oral hydration, correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, small frequent meals, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151947] -containing products, high f at meals, and 
alcohol. 
  Immune- mediated colitis has been associated with the administration of nivolumab. 
 
Participants experiencing interolable Grade [ADDRESS_1275146] antidiarrheal treatments should consul t a gastrointestinal (GI) doctor  for 
potential endoscopy and biopsy to help distinguish between cabozantinib vs. nivolumab mediated  toxicity .   If a biopsy is performed and:  
• there is T cell infiltration indicative of nivolumab -induced 
colitis, nivolumab should be permanently discontinued.  Once diarrhea returns to Grade 1, r estart cabozantinib at a

• there is no T cell infiltration indicative of nivolumab -
induced colitis, when diarrhea returns to Grade [ADDRESS_1275147] been 
tapered down to a prednisone dose ≤
 10 mg/day . Patients who resume treatment should be 
monitored closely for signs of renewed diarrhea.

6.2.3 Dermatologic Disorders  
 
Palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (also known as hand- foot syndrome), skin 
rash (including blisters, erythematous rash, macular rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis acneiform, and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, and erythema have been reported in cabozantinib- treated 
participants.  
  All participants on study should be advised on prophylactic skin care. This includes the use 
of hypoallergenic moisturizing creams, ointment for dry skin, and sunscreen with sun protection 
factor ≥ 30, avoidance of exposure of hands and feet to hot water, protection of pressure sensitive 
areas of hands and feet, and use of thick cotton gloves and socks to prevent injury and to keep the 
palms and soles dry. Participants with pre -existing skin disorders should be carefully monitored 
for signs of infection (e.g., abscess, cellulitis, or impetigo). 
Early signs of hand -foot syndrome could be tingling, numbness, and slight redness or mild 
hyperkeratosis. Early manifestations include painful, symmetrical red and swollen areas on the palms and soles. The lateral sid es of the fingers or periungual zones may also be affected.  
Adequate interventions are required to prevent worsening of skin symptoms such as 
blisters, desquamations, ulcerations, or necrosis of affected areas.  
Aggressive management of symptoms is recommended, including early dermatology 
referral. In the case of study treatment -related skin changes (eg, rash, hand- foot syndrome), the 
investigator may request that additional assessments be conducted with the subject’s consent. These assessments may include digital photographs of the skin changes and/or a biopsy of the 
affected skin and may be repeated until the skin changes resolve.

Grade 1 AEs  Continue cabozantinib  treatment at the current dose level if 
AE is manageable and tolerable.  Add supportive care as 
indicated.  
Grade 2 AEs which are 
tolerable  and are easily 
managed  
 Continue cabozantinib treatment at the current dose level  with 
supportive care or appropriate intervention. 
 At the discretion of the investigator, cabozantinib should be dose reduced or interrupted.  
Note: It is recommended that dose holds be as brief as 
possible.  
Grade 2 AEs which are 
intolerable  and cannot be 
adequately  managed  Cabozant inib should be held unless the toxicity can  be easily 
managed with a dose reduction and optimal medical care.  
 If held, cabozantinib can either restarted at same dose or dose reduced per investigator discretion. If same toxicity recurs at 
grade ≥2, the dose should be held and reduced when resolves 
to baseline.  
 
Note: It is recommended that dose holds be as brief as 
possible.

vomiting or as prophylaxis to prevent emesis, along with supportive care according to clinical practice guidelines.  
 
• The 5 -HT3 receptor antagonists are the preferred antiemetic 
• The following antiemtics should be avoided as they impact CYP3A4 which could 
impact cabozantinib exposure:  
o NK-1 receptor antagonists and dexamethasone  
o Glucocorticoids  
o Nabilone (weak inhibitor) 
 
When therapy with antiemetic agents  does not control the nausea or vomiting to tolerable levels, 
study treatment should be temporarily interrupted or dose reduced.  Stomatitis and Mucositis  
Preventive measures may include a comprehensive dental examination to identify any 
potential complications before study treatment is initiated. Removal of loc al factors should be 
instituted as indicated, such as modification of ill- fitting dentures and appropriate care of 
gingivitis. During treatment with cabozantinib good oral hygiene and standard local treatments such as nontraumatic cleansing and oral rinses  (e.g., with a weak solution of salt and baking soda) 
should be maintained. The oral cavity should be rinsed and wiped after meals, and dentures should be cleaned and brushed often to remove plaque. Local treatment should be instituted at the earliest onset of symptoms. Obtain bacterial/viral culture if oral infection is suspected and treat infection 
as indicated by [CONTACT_13144]. When stomatitis interferes with adequate nutrition and local therapy is not adequately effective, dose reduction or temporary  withholding of cabozantinib 
should be considered.

Hematological toxicities (ie, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) and associated 
complications have been observed after administration of cabozantinib and may be managed with 
dose interruptions and/or dose reductions. Use of granulocyte colony -stimulating factor support 
for neutrophil recovery is allowed per investigator discretion and in accordance with accepted guidelines after the first incidence of clinically relevant cytopenia.  
Complete blood counts with differentials and platelets should be performed regularly. 
Participantss with hematologic toxicities may require additional or more frequent laboratory tests according to institutional guidelines. Febrile neutropenia or evidence  of infection associated with 
neutropenia must be assessed immediately and treated appropriately and in a timely manner according to institutional guidelines.  
Dose reductions or dose interruptions for anemia are not mandated but can be applied as 
clinical ly indicated. Supportive care such as red blood cell transfusions may be managed according 
to institutional guidelines.  
 
6.3.3 Fatigue, Anorexia and Weightloss Disorders  
 
Fatigue has been reported during treatment with cabozantinib and nivolumab, the dose 
modifi cations are recommended for both drugs. Common causes of fatigue such as anemia, 
deconditioning, emotional distress (depression and/or anxiety), nutrition, sleep disturbance, and hypothyroidism should be ruled out and/or these causes treated according to s tandard of care. 
Individual non- pharmacological and/or pharmacologic interventions directed to the contributing 
and treatable factors should be given. Pharmacological management with psychostimulants such as methylphenidate should be considered after disease specific morbidities have been excluded.  
Dose reduction of study treatment should be considered when general or pharmacological 
measures have not been successful in reducing symptoms. Dose interruption may be considered for Grade ≥ 3 fatigue despi[INVESTIGATOR_908268], at the investigator’s discretion.  
Anorexia and weight loss should be managed according to local standard of care including 
nutritional support. Pharmacologic therapy such as megestrol acetate should be considered for appetite enhancement . Should these interventions prove ineffective, dose holds and reductions may 
be considered for Grade ≥ 3 anorexia or weight loss. If anorexia and/or weight loss do not recur 
after a dose reduction, dose of cabozantinib may be re- escalated to the previous dose.

Hypophosphatemia has been reported during treatment with cabozantinib.  
Mild hypophosphatemia is usually asymptomatic or symptoms can be non- specific such as 
weakness, bone pain, rhabdomyolysis, or altered mental status. Other causes of hypophosphatemia such as poor nutrition, chronic alcoholism, malabsorption, excessive antacid use, glucocorticoids use, kidney dysfunction, respi[INVESTIGATOR_245034], vitamin D deficiency should be ruled out and/or these causes treated according to standard of care.   
• Mild to moderate hypophosphatemia should be managed by [CONTACT_629946] (diary items, meats, 
beans) and/or oral phosphate supplements according to standard clinical practice guidelines.  
 
6.3.11 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw  
 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported with cabozantinib, the use of anti -
angiogenic drugs, bisphosphonates and denosumab in cancer patients. Additional risk factors for ONJ have been identified such as use of corticosteroids, chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, smoking, dental or orofacial surgery procedures, and cancer disease itself.

• Repeat ECG triplicates hourly until the average QTcF is ≤ 500 msec, or otherwise  
• Subjects with QTc prolongation and symptoms must be monitored closely until the QTc elevation and symptoms have resolved. Study treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose level if all of the following conditions are met: 
• Symptoms are determined to be unrelated to the QT interval prolongation 
• The QTcF value > 500 ms or increase of > 60 ms above baseline is not confirmed 
according to protocol procedures 
• Study treatment has been interrupted through a minimum of 1 week following the return 
of the QTcF to ≤ 500 msec or return to ≤ 60 ms above baseline.

6.4 Management of toxicities attributable to Nivolumab 
 
6.4.1 Steroid and immunosuppresive agents use on treatment with nivolumab: 
• Immunosuppressive agents and the use of systemic corticosteroids are permitted in the context of treating adverse events. Subjects receiving corticosteroids for treatment of drug- related adverse events must be at < 10 mg/day predn isone or equivalent prior to re-
initiation of study therapy . 
 
6.4.2 Elevated Amylase and/or Lipase  
 Patients may develop symptomatic and /or radiographic evidence of pancreatitis , DM, or 
pancreatic dysfunction. Amylase and lipase should be checked if there is cl inical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_908272]. Asymptomatic elevations can be self -limited and t reatment continued per guidelines 
above. Corticosteroids do not seem to alter the natural history of lipase/amylase elevations. 
Laboratory values tend to fluctuate on a day -to-day basis and eventually return to baseline or low 
grade over the course of weeks, whether or not subjects receive corticosteroids. Asymptomatic elevations should be monitored approximately on a weekly basis 
 Patients with symptomatic or radiographic pancreatitis  should discontinue nivolumab and 
consider consulting a gastroenterologist for management.

Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but responds promptly to symptomatic 
treatment [eg, antihistamines, non -steroidal anti- inflammato ry drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, 
bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours).  
 Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. R estart the infusion at 50% of the 
original infusion rate when symptoms resolve  to Grade ≤  1; if no further complications ensue after 
30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor participant closely. If symptoms recur then no further nivolumab will be administered at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_1275188] be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administration. If necessary, corticosteroids (recomm ended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) 
may be used.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following list of reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting  in addition  to routine 
reporting.  
 7.1 Adverse Events Lists  
 
7.1.1 Expected adverse event for nivolumab 
The PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_1275189] is involved in peripheral tolerance; therefore, such therapy may 
increase the risk of immune -related AEs, specifically the induction or enhancement of autoimmune 
conditions.  AEs with potentially immune -related causes, including rash, hypothyroidism, 
hepatitis/transaminitis, colitis, myositis, and myasthenia gravis, have been observed. 
 
7.1.2 Expected adverse event for cabozantinib 
The general adverse event profile of cabozantinib includes GI symptoms (such as nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea), fatigue, anorexia, palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia  (PPE) syndrome, 
skin rash, elevated ALT and AST, increased pancreatic enzymes with rare cases of  pancreatitis, 
as well as side effects associated with inhibition of VEGF signaling such as thrombotic events (eg, pulmonary embolism [ PE] and deep vein thrombosis [ DVT ]), hypertension, proteinuria, 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/2019  
 
69 hemorrhagic events, and rare cases of gastrointestinal [ GI] perforation and rectal/perirectal 
abscess. Additionally, events of a rterial thromboembolism (transient ischemic attack [TIA], 
myocardial infarction [MI]) have been reported.   For a full listing of safety events please refer to

8.1.[ADDRESS_1275199] Form.  8.2 Cabozantinib 
 
8.2.1 Description  
Cabozantinib is the ( S)-malate salt of cabozantinib, a kinase inhibitor. Cabozantinib ( S)-malate  
is described chemically as N -(4-(6,7-dimethoxyquinolin-4- yloxy)phenyl) -N’-(4- 
fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide, (2 S)-hydroxybutanedioate. The molecular  
formula is C
28H24FN 3O5·C4H6O5 and the molecular weight is 635.6 Daltons as malate salt. The 
chemical structure of cabozantinib ( S)-malate salt is:  
 
 
 In vitro biochemical and/or cellular assays have shown that cabozantinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of MET, VEGFR -1, -2 and -3, AXL, RET, ROS1, TYRO3, MER, KIT, TRKB, 
FLT-3, and TIE-2. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function

 9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
  In all patients in whom a tumor safely accessible, a baseline tumor biopsy is required. We plan to 
use baseline biopsy tissue to perform a number of immune profiling assays, detailed below.  On baseline tumor biopsies, we will perform characterization based on histology (TILs), protein expression, and mRNA expression.  Additionally, we will bank specimens for possible future DNA analysis, and other further te sting.  
 
Serial blood draws for correlative science are required on this trial; blood draws will be obtained 
every 4 weeks  prior to the infusion of study drugs, at the end- of-treatment visit in patients who go 
off study for progressive disease, and all efforts will be made to obtain an additional blood draw at the time of progressive disease, in patients who went off study for anything other than progressive disease.  On each blood draw, we will perform flow cytometry to characterize protein expression of immune mediators, detailed below, and additional blood will be banked for future testing.  
 All patients will additionally be asked to provide a stool sample at three separate timepoints: prior to treatment, during treatment, and at the time of disease progre ssion. A fourth collection 
may be requested from patients who experience grade ≥ 2 diarrhea after discussion with the PI.

9.2.1 Objectives:  
 
• Characterizing immune markers in metastatic TNBC.  
• To evaluate MET and phospho MET expression in tumor tissue at baseline by [CONTACT_9064]  
 
9.2.2 Collection  
 
Biopsies are required at screening and C3D1 (Any time from C2D14- C2D2 8 is allowed).  
 Biopsies should not be performed on Friday afternoons, as there may not be time for processing 
of the fresh tissue.  If a biopsy must be performed on Friday morning, the lab of Mariano Severgnini must be notified ahead of time to ensure that there will be  adequate time for processing 
fresh tissue, since fresh tissue cannot be stored over the weekend.  The specimens in RNALater and formalin may be stored over the weekend and shipped on Monday. Specimens in RNA Later and formalin should be stored at room temperature until shipment.  
 
Ideally five  core biopsies will be obtained: 
• One core should be placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin tube supplied by [CONTACT_1758]. 
• One core should be placed in RNAlater 
• Two core should be placed in sterile DMEM 
 The order of specimen collection should be: 
• First core: 10% neutral buffered formalin  
• Second core: Sterile DMEM

 Tissue remaining after specific protocol testing described below will be banked in the Clinical Trial Core Laboratory (Deborah Dillon, MD)  and may be used for additional or future analyses as 
needed.  
  
9.2.4 Potential Testing  
Assay 1: Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) percentage and determin ation of lymphocyte 
predominant breast cancer (LPBC)  
Paraffinized, hematoxylin and eosin- stained slides taken from two tissue planes 
will be derived from each biopsy and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_313857].  In the research setting, all cases are r eviewed by [CONTACT_908309].  The extent of lymphocytic infiltrate in tumor tissue will be assessed, and stromal TIL percentage will be determined.  More detailed guidelines for the quantification of stromal TILs in breast cancer can be found in the recommendations from the International TILs Working Group 2014.[ Salgado  et al., 2015] 
 After assessment of the TIL percentage, the pathologists will categorize the specimen as lymphocyte predominant breast cancer (LPBC), defined as a tumor that contains >60% stromal lymphocytes, or non- LPBC.  
 Assay 2: Immunohistochemistry  
 
Tissue will be collected and fixed by 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight, dehydrated, and paraffin embedded.  Four micrometer -thick sections will be cut.  
The paraffin blocks and unstained slides will be stored at room temperature.  All immunohistochemical staining will be performed in the Center for Immuno-Oncology Pathology Core at Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) 
Specialized Histopathology Core.  Formalin fixed -paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor slides w ill be prepared and H&E 
stained for assessment of TIL in pre - and post -treatment tumor samples.  To identify 
subsets of different immune populations (effector/memory CD8 cells, T regulatory cells, dendritic cells, tumor associated macrophages, and Tie -2 ex pressing 
monocytes (TEM)), immunohistochemical (IHC) staining will be performed on FFPE tumor slices using some or all of the following antibodies: Core set: CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, PD- L2 
Others: CD3, CD4, CD25, FoxP3, Indoleamine 2,3 deoxygenase -1 (IDO1), CD11c , 
CD83, CD86, CD56, CD14, CD16, Tie2 (See also Appendix B)  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275205] developed IHC staining on paraffin embedded 
tissues for PD -L1, PD -L2, TIM -3, and LAG -3 through our center for Immuno-
Oncology Pathology Core (Scott Rodig MD, PhD Core Director, is a co -
investigator on this protocol).  PD -L1 IHC has recently been established in a CLIA 
approved laboratory and the remaining assays for CLIA laboratory conduct are being finalized.  
 These investigators have published the methods, protocols, and data establishing the sensitivity and specificity of IHC staining assays using the monoclonal antibodies recognizing PD -L1 (CD274, B7- H1, antibody clone 7G11, generated in 
the lab of Gordon Freeman, DFCI) and PD -L2 (CD273, B7- DC, clone 9E5, 
generated in the laboratory of Gordon Freeman, DFCI in two recent 
manuscripts.[ Chen  et al. , 2013, Shi  et al. , 2014] 
  Below is a schematic of the workflow for the tissue-based biomarker analysis. 
 
 
 Tumor will be considered positive if >5% (PD -L1)[Topalian  et al. , 2012] or >10% 
(PD-L2) of the tumor cell population demonstrates unequivocal staining.  PD -1 
positivity will be defined as >3% positive cells/high power field. [Bachireddy  et al. , 
2014]   All IHC stained slides will be evaluated and scored by a pathologist.  A 

 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275206] visual  scoring (semi -quantitative, but with increased specificity for 
delineating neoplastic and non -neoplastic cells) and pathologist- assisted, 
automated scoring (quantitative, but without accurately delineating neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells) for each mar ker of interest will be assessed for its clinical 
value.  As necessary, the data from combinations of markers will also be considered (i.e. combined scores from PD -L1 and PD -L2 expression).  All data will be 
analyzed in conjunction with the biostatistics group.  
   Assay 3: Flow cytometry  
 
TILs will be isolated from the biopsy specimen as described in the lab manual  Surface staining followed by [CONTACT_908310] .  The following antibodies may be used 
on all specimens: (core set)  
CD8  
PD-1 
PD-L1 
PD-L2 
 A selection of the following antibodies may also be used, and additional antibodies may be used as well, as deemed appropriate and informative based on the state of the immune profiling literature at the time of correlative science performance:  
CD4  
FOXP3  
CD127 (Other antibodies as listed in Appendix B) 
 Assay 4: RNA analysis  
 
RNA analysis may be performed, and tissue for RNA analysis will be stored, in the 
Clinical Tr ials Core Laboratory ( Deborah Dillon, MD). 
 Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression within tumor biopsy specimens may be 
assessed using the most current and informative methodologies at the time that correlative science is performed on all specimens.  NanoString signatures and comprehensive RNA sequencing may be used.  Potential genes of interest, based 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275207] tumors,[ Denkert  et al. , 2015] include CXCL9, 
CCL5, CD8ACD80, CXCL13, IGKC, CD21, IDO1, PD -1, PD -L1, PD -L2, 
CTLA4, and FOXP3. 
 
Assay 5: Evalu ate c-Met and phospho-c-Met expression in tumor tissue  
 
Tumor tissue sections will be deparaffinized prior to antigen retrieval, blocking, and incubation with primary antibodies.  Patients will be dichotomized as to whether  or not their tumor expresses c- Met and the association between 
expression  and response to therapy will be evaluated  
 Assay 6: Single cell sequencing  
  
1. TNBC tumor biopsies in DMEM media will be delivered to [CONTACT_908319] 
(Immunology Lead, TIGL*), Wandi Zhang (Research Technician), or Phuong Le (Research Technician) at the Tissue Immunogenomics Lab, TIGL (Dana 520).  
2. The tumor will be processed using collagenase, hyalurinidase and DNase to generate single cell s uspension. 
3. These cells will be stained with CD45 antibody. CD45 positive vs negative single cells will be sorted into 96 wells plates at the Hematology/Oncology flow cytometry core 
facility (Mayer 584).  
4. Single cell sorted plates will be transferred to [CONTACT_908320] (Technology Lead, 
TIGL) and [CONTACT_908321] (Senior Scientist) at the Genomics Lab, TIGL (Smith 1048, 
Dana Farber), who will generate single cell RNA -seq libraries. For single -cell TCR 
analysis, the RNA -seq libraries will be sequenced in the TIGL Genomics Lab using next-
generation sequencing (NGS). For single- cell transcriptome analysis, [CONTACT_55209] will drop off 
the RNA -seq libraries at the Broad Institute walk -up sequencing station ([ADDRESS_1275208], Cambridge) for sequencing using NGS.

If the study team is unable to provide the kits to the patients in clinic, they may be mailed to patients by [CONTACT_40221]. All kits will contain a questionnaire for patients to  complete and return with their samples 
regarding timing and conditions surrounding their stool sample.   Please refer to the separate stool information sheet for collection and processing instructions.  Samples will be stored at the BWH/Harvard Cohorts Re pository and will be shipped in batches

9.4.2 Analysis of DNA extraction  from stool samples  
 Microbial DNA is extracted using the Mag -Bind Universal Pa thogen DNA Kit (Omega Bio -
Tek). Briefly, 250 mg of the specimen is transferred to a deep- well plate for bead beating 
followed by [CONTACT_313859][INVESTIGATOR_313810]’s instructions. Finally, DNA is eluted in 100 uls of Elution Buffer and stored at -80°C until further use. 16S sequencing libraries are generated by [CONTACT_313860] v3 -v4 hypervariable regions of the 16S 
gene in a polymerase chain reaction using primers F341and R785. Resulting amplicons are tagged with unique molecular barcodes that are later used to demultiplex sequencing reads into individual sample buckets. Libraries are loaded on a MiSeq flowcell and sequenced following Illumina’s loading instructions. Sequence data are retrieved from the instrument by [CONTACT_313861].  
 MicrobiomeDX uses BacPro™, a proprietary algorithm, to inspect and validate sequencing files by [CONTACT_313862], trimming, merging, and quality filtering steps. Paired sequencing reads are merged using an overlap of [ADDRESS_1275218] the SILVA database at 99% sequence identity to obtain accurate taxonomic classifications and relative abundances. In parallel, feature tables are constructed to derive alpha diversity indices, and distance matrices are built to derive beta diversity indices. The BacPro
TM 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_908284] a comprehensive report that includes alpha diversity scores describing community richness and evenness, taxonomic composition with relative abundances, and beta diversity metrics to determine the in -between sample differences based on the bacterial 
communities identified.

DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275226] – Solid tumors   
 
Response and progression in sites of metastases will be evaluated in this study using the 
international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_39694] 1.1 criteria [ Eisenhauer  et al. , 2009] .  Changes in 
the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions a nd the shortest diameter 
in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.   
11.1.[ADDRESS_1275227] their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Not e:  Participants who exhibit objectiv e disease progression 
prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response.  Participants who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the def initions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non- target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_1275228] one dimension (longest diamet B er  to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_1275229] x -r a y  o r  ≥ [ADDRESS_1275230] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area are not considered measurable.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be cons idered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_1275231] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/2019  
 
93 pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered non-measurable.  
 Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for rad iographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 les ions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  
and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), b e representative of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. I f lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions  and should 
also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not requ ired, but the 
presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow up.  
 
11.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Disease 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].   
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diameter as 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/2019  
 
94 assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray.  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defin ed and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]; however, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specif ications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the 
type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
FDG -PET.  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the  use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
(a) Negative FDG -PET at baseline, w ith a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. (b)  No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
PD.  If the posi tive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on 
CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -
PET s can).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
(c)  FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively 
described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical literature for the 
indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake

Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275232] (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with 
conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
MIBG (meta -iodobenzylguanidine).The following is recommended, to assure high 
quality images are obtained.  
Patient preparation: Iodides, usually SSKI (saturated solution of potassium iodide), are administered to reduce thyroidal accumulation of free radioiodine, preferably beginning the day prior to injection and continuing for 3 additional days (4 days total). For infants and children, one drop t.i.d. is sufficient, for adolescents 2 drops t.i.d., and for adults 3 drops t.i.d. Participants and/or parents are asked about exposure to potential  
interfering agents. If none is noted, an indwelling intravenous line is established. The dose of MIBG is administered by [CONTACT_67481] 90 seconds.  
Images from the head to the distal lower extremities should be obtained.  
I-123MIBG scintigraphy is performed to obtain both planar and tomographic images.  
Planar: Anterior and posterior views from the top of the head to the proximal lower 
extremities are obtained for 10 minutes at 24 hours and occasionally at 48 hours following injection of 10 mCi/1.7 square meters of body surface area (~150 μCi/kg, 
maximum 10 mCi). Anterior views of the distal lower extremities are adequate. A large field of view dual head gamma camera with low energy collimators is preferred.  
 SPECT: Most participants receiving I -[ADDRESS_1275233]/CT may be performed at institutions with this capacity.  
 
Ultrasound. Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as 
a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later data and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about radiation exposure from

Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275234] in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.  The utilization of these tec hniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers.  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487- 488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461- 3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  
26:1148- 1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -
[ADDRESS_1275235] -line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 
Cytology, Histology.  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions o nly is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_343], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of New Lesions 
 The finding of a new  lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in 
scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). Ho wever, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in an anatomical 
location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up evaluation will clarify if 
it truly repre sents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared 
using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

11.1.4 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation).

11.3.1 Definition of Tumor Response Using Immune- Related Response 
Criteria (irRC)  
 
The sum of the longest diameter of lesions (SPD) at tumor assessment using the immune -
related response criteria (irRC) for progressive disease incorporate the contribution of new measurable lesions.  Each net Percentage Change in Tumor Burden per assessment using irRC criteria accounts for the size and growth kinetics of both old and new lesions as they appear.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Impact of New Lesio ns on irRC 
 
New lesions in and of themselves do not qualify as progressive disease.  However, their contribution to total tumor burden is included in the SPD which in turn feeds into the irRC criteria for tumor response.  Therefore, new non- measurable lesions will not discontinue 
any subject from the study. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Target Lesions Response Using irRC 
 
• irComplete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all target lesions.  This category 
encompasses exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_908314] c riteria.  
• irPartial Response (irPR):  Decrease, relative to baseline, or 50% or greater in the sum of 
the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all target and all new measurable target lesions (i.e., Percentage Change in Tumor Burden).  Note : the appearance of new 
measurable lesions is factored into the overall tumor burden, but does not automatically qualify as progressive disease until the SBD increases by  >25% when compared to SPD at 
nadir. 
• irStable Disease (irSD):  Does not meet criteria for irRC or irPR, in the absence of 
progressive disease.

• irComplete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all non -target lesions.  This 
category encompasses exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_270336].  
• irPartial Response (irPR) or irStable Disease (irSD):  Non-target lesion(s) are not 
considered in the definition of PR; these terms do not apply. 
• irProgressive Disease (irPD):  Increases in number or size of non- target lesion(s) does not 
constitute progressive disease unless/until the Percentage  Change in Tumor Burden 
increases by 25% (i.e. the SPD at nadir of the target lesions increases by [CONTACT_453105]). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Overall Response Using irRC 
 
Overall response using irRC will be based on these criteria:  
 
• Immune -Related Complete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all tumor 
lesions (target an non- target) together with no new measurable/unmeasurable lesions for at 
least 4 weeks from the date of documentation of complete response. 
• Immune -Related Partial Response (irPR):  The sum of  the products of the two largest 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions is measured and captured as the SPD baseline.  At each subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all target lesions and of new measurabl e lesions are added together to provide the 
Immune Response Sum of Product Diameters (irSPD).  A decrease, relative to baseline, of the irSPD compared to the previously SPD baseline  of 50% or greater is considered an irPR.  
• Immune -Related Stable Disease (i rSD):  irSD is defined as the failure to meet criteria for 
immune complete response or immune partial response, in the absence of progressive disease  
• Immune -Related Progressive Disease (irPD):  It is recommended in difficult cases to 
confirm PD by [CONTACT_242841].  Any of the following will constitute PD:  At least 25% increase in the SPD of all target lesions over baseline SPD calculated for the target lesions.  
 At least 25% increase in the SPD of all target lesions and new measurable lesions (irSPD) over the baseline SPD calculated for the target lesions.

  13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 This is an open- label, single -arm,single -center , phase 2 study of cabozantinib (40mg per oral 
daily ) in combination with nivolumab (480mg intravenously on day 1, every 28 days) in subjects 
with metastatic triple -negative breast cancer previously treated with [ADDRESS_1275241] 1.1 (Section 11) , in patients with metastatic TNBC  previously treated with 0 to 3 lines of 
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting . 
 
Secondary endpoints include: 
Secondary endpoints include the ORR of the combination according to immune- related response 
criteria (irRC) [ Wolchok et al. , 2009] (Section 11), the clinical benefit rate, and PFS according to 
RECIST 1.1.  
Blood and Tissue c orrelative science objectives include:   
• To characterize a broad array of immune markers in metastatic TNBC (characterization will be based on histology, protein expression, and mRNA expression). 
• To explore how different immunosuppressive and/or immune -stimulating immune marker 
profiles at baseline correlate with disease response to therapy ( PFS, objective response assessed 
by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 and immune- related response criteria).  
• To characterize changes in tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes, PD -L1 expression and immune gene 
signatures in the tissue microenvironment (TME) from baseline to after 2 cycles of the experimental combination . 
• To explore whether induction of  changes in the immunosuppressive and/or immune -stimulating 
immune marker profile in TME correlates with disease response to therapy (response assessed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 and immune- related response criteria).  
• To evaluate MET and phospho MET expression in tumor  tissue at baseline by 
[CONTACT_9064]  
• To explore the effect of treatment on plasma biomarkers (sVEGFR2, sMET, IL -2, IFN -γ, TNF -
α) 
• To characterize serial changes in immune marker profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in plasma over the course of the trial treatment.  
• To explore whether induction of changes in the immunosuppressive and/or immune -stimulating 
immune marker profile in PBMCs correlates with disease response to therapy (response assessed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 and immune- related response criteria).  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/2019  
 
104 • To investigate whether there is an immune marker in circulating PBMCs that corresponds to 
tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) percentage in baseline tumor.  
• To collect blood to study cell -free DNA for comparison to tumor specimens before a nd after 
immunotherapy 
 
Stool and microbiome correlative science endpoints: 
 Overall, we plan to describe the landscape of gut microbiota in patients with BC who will receive the combination of cabozantinib plus nivolumab, and the changes in their gut microbiota after two cycles of the combination. Statistical analyses of intestinal microbiota samples will be performed using R Statistical Language (v3.1.1) and GraphPad Prism (version 6.0e) software packages. Unpaired Mann–Whitney rank sum test (two- tailed) will be used for comparisons of 
continuous variables between two groups. Bar plots will be used to represent the data’s mean at the center values, with error bars to indicate standard deviation.  In order to explore the association of response (objective response according RECIST 1.1 and PFS) to baseline microbiota diversity, and changes from baseline in microbiota, inference will be based on 
Wilcoxon rank sum tests and estimates of predictive value along the continuous scales will be 
visualized using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and reported with c-index and confidence intervals derived from variance estimates of Somers rank correlation. Unadjusted P-values will be considered  significant for the Mann –Whitney rank sum test.  
 We will quantify microbiome features from amplicon, metagenome, metatranscriptome using established pi[INVESTIGATOR_313817] -level taxonomic, functional gene, transcriptional, and 
microbially -mediated metabolite profiles associated with BC patients with and without 
immunotherapy70
-76. We will use modified multivariate linear modeling to identify statistically 
significant features associated with outcomes. Statistical tests for association with these outcomes and covariates will be performed using the sparse generalized linear model MaAsLin, which provides random effects models for both log- Gaussian and zero -inflated negative binomial 
link functions. Computational workflows for these steps are implemented as AnADAMA2 (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/anadama) workflows, a reproducible data handling environment that captures all provenance during the analysis process.   13.2 Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration  
 
Based on data of recent trials with a similar population treated with anti- PD-1/PD- 1 agents 
or cabozantinib in monotherapy{Tolaney, 2016 #1433}{Dirix, 2015 #1075}{Nanda, 2016 
#1389}, and considering that our population will not be previously selected by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 expression 
status, a  true ORR  of 10% or less would not be of clinical interest, and is the null hypothesis to the 
Simon optimal two-stage design. A true rate of 30 % would be considered a clinically meaningful 
level of response, so the sample size was chosen to have higher power ( 90%) to declare the 
combination effective at this rate, while contr olling the one -sided Type I error at no more than 5% 
under the null. 
Using Simon’s optimal two -stage design, in the first stage, [ADDRESS_1275242] stage we will perform a safety run -in analysis. If there are 2 or more dos e-limiting 
toxicity (DLTs) in the first 6 patients included, the trial will be closed for further enrol lment.  Dose -

105 limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed in the first cycle. In the case of enroll ment will continued, 
this first 6 patients will be included  in the efficacy analysis. Thus, according to  Simon’s optimal 
two-stage design , if in this first stage there are at least [ADDRESS_1275243]  7 patients 
with ORR among the 35 patients, the regimen will be considered worthy of further study.  If the 
true response rate is 10%, the chance the regimen is declared worthy of further study is less than 5% (exact alpha = 0.047).  If the true response r ate is 30%, the chance that the regimen is declared 
worthy of further study is 90% 
 
Table below shows the probability of continuing enrollment with ≤ [ADDRESS_1275244] 6 
patients.

intervals. CBR will be reported respectively with 95% exact confidence intervals. PFS will be 
analyzed using Kaplan –Meier product -limit estimates and will be plotted using Kaplan -Meier 
plots. PFS is defined as the time from study randomization to disease progression according 
RECIST 1.1, medical judgment or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.  Patients alive without disease progression are censored at the date of last disease evaluation.  The hazard ratio for each time -to-event  endpoint will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals derived from the 
Cox proportional hazard model, but no hypothesis testing will be conducted.   
 
Safety and to lerability   
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with any study agent. Toxicity will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0. Toxicities will be summarized by [CONTACT_313870].  Incidence rate of each toxicity will be reported with 95% exact CI.  The incidence rates of any grade 3+ toxicity will be compared between two arms using Fisher’s exact test.  
 
Correlative endpoints 
Previous studies demonstrated that, in addition to its direct cytoreductive effect, RT -induced cell 
death can be immunogenic, facilitating the recruitment and activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and priming of tumor antigen -specific T -cells[Shahabi  et al. , 2015] . Recently, d ifferent 
groups demonstrated that RT to the tumor bed led to upregulation of PD -L1 on tumor cells, 
dendritic cells, and on myeloid- derived suppressive cells (MDSCs), which may contribute to 
impairment of T -cell function in the tumor [Liang  et al. , 2013, Deng  et al. , 2014, Sharabi  et al. , 
2014] . Furthermore, these groups also demonstrated that the combination of RT plus blockade of 
the PD -1/PD- L1 axis improved outcomes in di fferent preclinical models compared with RT or 
anti-PD1/PD -L1 alone, including breast cancer models.  
 Recently, Herbst et al have demonstrated that patients who presented an increase of at least 5% in expression of PD -L1 in tumor microenvironment experienced a bigger likelihood to respond to 
treatment with the anti -PD-L1 Atezolizumab [Herbst  et al. , 2014 ]. Also, modifications in molecular 
signature [CONTACT_908318]. Because of 
this rationale, we plan to p erform two research biopsies in tumor lesion: one at baseline and the 
other one just before the begging of cycle [ADDRESS_1275250] 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50%  increases of PD -L1 
positivity rate. The power calculation is based on McNemar’s test with 1 -sided alpha of 0.05 and 
assuming 2% of patients unexpectedly show PD -L1 positivity only in the baseline assessment. The 
calculation was done using East v6.3 (Cytel Inc).

tables. An exploratory analysis is planned to evaluate PD -L1 change in continuous scale. 
 
13.7 Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.7.1 Evaluation of Efficacy 
For this Phase II trial, the efficacy evaluable population is a modified intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population.  The modified ITT population consists of all patients who initiate protocol therapy, even if there are major protocol therapy deviations.   Subanalyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of participants, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excl uding participants from the analysis should be clearly 
reported.  If applicable to the endpoint, the 95% confidence intervals should also be provided.   
13.7.[ADDRESS_1275252]-treatment safety data of any kind would be excluded.

DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275261] institutional procedures. The amount of tissue collected may follow the guidelines listed below: 
 Skin/chest wall: A goal of 2 4-mm punch biopsies will be obtained.  Lymph node: A goal of 3 -6 core biopsy specimens will be obtained using an 18- gauge needle.  
 Liver: A goal of 3-6 core biopsy specimens will be obtained using an 18-gauge needle.  Lung: Because of the risk of pneumothorax associated with core needle biopsies of lung nodules, no core biopsies of lung nodules are mandated on this protocol, unless they are clinically indicated.  
 Bone: Because the yield of malignant tissue from bone biopsies tends to be relatively low, if a patient has another accessible site of disease (i.e. skin, lymph node, liver), that site should be biopsied preferentially. If bone is the only biopsy- accessible site, then a goal of [ADDRESS_1275262] clinical judgment at the time the procedure is  performed . Less than the 
goal quantity of tissue is accepted for each type of biopsy, and will be left to the clinical judgment of the physician performing the procedure.  Coded laboratory specimens will be stored in the Tumor Bank of the DFCI. These spec imens 
will become the property of DFCI. Patients will be informed that their specimens may be used for research by [CONTACT_430201]/HCC and other approved collaborators. Shared specimens will be identified with a sample ID number; all patient identifying material will be removed.  
 Risks of Research Biopsy and Procedures for Minimizing Risk  
 Potential risks according to site are:  
Skin/chest wall (punch biopsy): 
• Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding  
• Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, or infection 
 Lymph node, liver, or bone (core needle biopsy): 
• Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding  
• Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_908288], infection, damage to adjacent organs. Additional risks may be 
present if intravenous conscious sedation is required  Breast (core biopsy): 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/2019  
 
119 • Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding.  
• Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_908289], infection, pneumothorax, damage to adjacent organs. 
 Pleural fluid (thoracentesis): 
• Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding  
• Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190747], infection, pneumothorax, damage to adjacent  organs 
 Ascites fluid (paracentesis): 
• Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding  
• Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190747], infection, bowel perforation or damage to adjacent organs. In order to minimize the risk of a biopsy, only qualified personnel will perform these procedures.  
 Prior to the procedure, the physician performing the procedure will discuss the risks with each study participant, answer any questions, and obtain separate procedure consent. Patients will be evaluated for comorbidities or concomitant medications that may increase the risk of potential complications. For biopsies of lesions that are not superficial and clearly palpable, imaging studies such as CT or ultrasound will be used to guide the biopsy in order to minimize the risk of damage to adjacent structures. After lymph node biopsies, patients will be observed a minimum of 2 hours (rang e 2-4 hours) after the procedure, or according to standard institutional guidelines. 
After liver biopsies, patients will be observed a minimum of 4 hours (range 4-6 hours) after the procedure, or according to standard institutional guidelines. Less than the goal quantity of tissue is accepted for each type of biopsy, and will be left to the clinical judgment of the physician performing the procedure.  Risks of Anesthesia  
 Local Anesthesia  
All biopsy procedures require local anesthesia using lidocaine, xyloc aine, or related  
compounds. There is a small risk of an allergic reaction associated with these drugs. In order to minimize the risk of local anesthesia, only qualified personnel will perform the biopsy procedure. Patients will be queried if they have had previous allergic reactions to local anesthetics.  
 Intravenous Conscious Sedation  
Certain biopsy procedures, such as lymph node, liver, or bone biopsies, may require intravenous conscious sedation (IVCS). IVCS is a minimally depressed level of consciousnes s 
that retains the patient’s ability to maintain a patent airway independently and continuously and respond appropriately to physical stimulation and verbal commands. The risks of intravenous conscious sedation include: inhibition of the gag reflex and concomitant 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/2019  
 
120 risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], cardiopulmonary complications (myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, 
hypoxemia), and allergic reactions to the sedative or analgesic medications. These risks are small but real; for example, in a prospective study of 14,149 patients undergoing IVCS during upper gastrointestinal endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the rate of immediate cardiopulmonary events was 2 in 1000.[ Quine  et al. , 1995] The 30-day mortality was 1 per 2,000 cases. In this study, there was a 
strong association between lack of monitoring and use of high-dose benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_313822]. There was also an association between the use of local anesthetic sprays to the oropharynx and the development of pneumonia. In order to minimize the risk of intravenous conscious sedation, only qualified personnel will be responsible for conscious sedation. A minimum of two individuals will be involved in the care of patients undergoing conscious sedation —the physician performing the biopsy procedure, and the individual (M.D. or R.N.) who 
monitors the patients and his/her response to both the sedation and the procedure, and who is capable of assisting with any supportive or resuscit ative measures. The room where the 
procedure utilizing IVCS takes place will have adequate equipment to provide supplemental oxygen, monitor vital signs, and maintain an airway should this be necessary. An emergency cart will also be immediately accessible  to the room where the procedure is to take place, and 
emergency support services will be available on page. Patients will be screened and evaluated for their fitness to undergo conscious sedation by a trained physician. Patients with active cardiac diseas e are excluded from this study. No local anesthetic spray to the oropharynx will be 
necessary, given that endoscopy is not a planned procedure. Following the procedure, patients will be observed closely in the recovery room for a minimum of 2 hours.  Gener al Anesthesia  
Because of the higher risk of general anesthesia compared with local anesthesia or intravenous conscious sedation, biopsies that would require general anesthesia in order to be performed are not permitted on this protocol.  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-324 
Protocol Version Date: 4/9/[ADDRESS_1275263], Etc: 
1. After biopsy is performed, the tissue mass is placed on a sterile gauze 2. Using forceps, separate the tumor tissue 3. Place 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928] (cores) of tumor tissue in each cassette (typi[INVESTIGATOR_313823] 3 cassettes  
per b iopsy); the last cassette will contain many small pi[INVESTIGATOR_313824]  
4. Fill cassettes with OCT  
a. Completely cover tissue b. Limit the amount of bubbles 
5. Place cassettes on dry ice and prepare for transport by [CONTACT_313877]  
6. Return samples to the lab and complete freezing of samples in OCT with dry ice (about 10 minutes freezing time)  
7. Once samples are frozen, place in plastic bag; label bag with date, protocol number, patient number, and number of initials included 8. Store in –80C freezer  
 
For Effusions and Ascites  
1. Fluid sample should be split into two equal aliquots 2. One aliquot should be spun down into a pellet and snap frozen in an ETOH/dry ice bath or in liquid N2 3. One aliquot should be fixed and processed as a standard cell block. 
Note: if the sample preparation is done by a clinical cytopathology laboratory, it is important to  
explain that the sample is for research purposes only and that no thin prep should be performed  
as this uses up a significant portion of the samp le. 
 
For Fine Needle Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_313825]  
A goal of 3 passes:  
1. One pass should be evacuated and rinsed directly into 2mL of room temperature Trizol for RNA analysis.  
2. One pass should be evacuated and rinsed directly into 2mL of room temperature Trizol for DNA analysis.  
3. One pass should be evacuated and rinsed directly into 10- 20mL of RPMI to prepare a cell  
block.

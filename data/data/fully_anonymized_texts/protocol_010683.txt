Improving Functional Outcomes of Veterans with PTSD and Tobacco Dependence  
Study Protocol  with Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
April 23, [ADDRESS_89204]-PT vs. the American Lung Association’s Freedom From Smoking program [FFS]) . 
This study has two primary aims:   
AIM 1 : Evaluate the relative feasibility and acceptability of ACT-PT vs. FFS .  
AIM 2:  Evaluate the preliminary efficacy of ACT -PT vs. FFS with the pri mary outcomes of tobacco use, 
PTSD symptoms, health -related quality of life, and functional impairment.  
 Treatment Procedures. [ADDRESS_89205]-PT 
(n=25) or FFS (n=25) .  
 ACT Treatment Components . The following eight components are emphasized in ACT -PT: 1) Identifying 
Problems with Control:  Participants identify efforts to control or avoid smokin g-related internal experiences and 
how this is problematic for quitting smoking. 2) Acceptance:  Participa nts face smoking urges and PTSD -related 
experiences with mindful acceptance  rather than avoid them. 3) Mindfulness : Participants engage in 
mindfulness exercises in order to practice nonjudgmental acceptance of internal smoking  and PTSD -related 
experiences.  4) Valued living : Participants clarify their values and goals (i.e., quitting smoking, work 
achievement, social connections), and identify barriers that prevent them from achieving life goals. 5) Triggers : 
Internal (e.g., thoughts, feelings, bodily sensat ions) vs. external smoking triggers are identified, and Veterans 
practice acceptance and mindfulness to manage these experiences . 6) Exposure : Participants create exposure 
hierarchies for PTSD -related triggers  and other  internal experiences related to smoking, face them with mindful 
acceptance, and become more comfortable with these experiences. 7) Cognitive Defusion : Participants learn 
that they are not their anxieties or fears, and they mindfully observe and accept the se internal experiences. 8) 
Behavioral Activation : Participants identify life goals and increase activities to replace smoking as a behavior 
used to manage anxiety, stress, and to fill idle time. Participants commit to achieving valued goals.  
 ACT-PT proce dures.  Participant s will receive nine 50-minute weekly individual counseling sessions , with a  
booster session one month following the final session . Session 1 is devoted to an explanation of the treatment 
rationale. Sessions 2 -4 focus on acceptance , mindfulness, cognitive defusion, behavioral activation, and skills 
practice, with an emphasis on tolerance of PTSD -related triggers  and replacing smoking with positive life 
activities . Session 5 is the scheduled quit week when the nicotine patch is started.  Sessions 6 -9 focus on 
acceptance and mindfulness of  nicotine withdrawal , cravings,  and PTSD symptoms , as well as behavioral 
activation . Sessions 1 -6 will occur weekly; sessions [ADDRESS_89206] one mo nth after the end of the main course of treatment . 
 Control Condition.  The American Lung Association’s Freedom from Smoking program (FFS) [49-51], 
commonly used in community treatment programs,  will be the control condition.  FFS will consist of the same 
dosage / intensity of psychosocial treatment or nine 50-minute individual counseling sessions , with a  booster 
session one month following the final session . The first session will discuss the health e ffects of smoking. The 
second session will discuss copi[INVESTIGATOR_81950]. Sessions 3 -4 will focus on the benefits of 
quitting. The scheduled quit date for participant s is Session 5 (when the nicotine patch is started) and will focus 
on managi ng nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Sessions 6 -9 will focus on relapse prevention and non -smoking 
lifestyle choices  (e.g., weight management, exercise). Sessions [ADDRESS_89207].     
 Rationale for FFS.  After reviewing the literature, and carefully weighing pros and cons of many options  
[52-57], FFS was chosen as the comparison condition for several reasons: 1) FFS and similar treatments are 
usual care in many VA smoking cessation clinics [58]; 2) FFS is a n effective treatment [49, 59]; and 3) this 
control condition has been previously used in other mindfulness smoking cessation studies [60]. We 
considered many alternatives , including  historical controls, a no -treatment group, a minimal treatment 
condition, waitlist controls, or a nonspecific (“placebo”) therapy [54, 55, 61]. A [ADDRESS_89208] training procedures. Four psychology postdoctoral fellows  will be trained and 
treat Veterans (two in Year 1 and two in Year 2) . We will use a systematic procedure for teaching therapi[INVESTIGATOR_81951] -PT and FFS in a competent and  reliable fashion.  Training components include: 1) reviewing the 
manual; 2) listening to portions of selected treatment tapes that illustrate methods; 3) role playing techniques; 
4) participating in a structured workshop to enhance familiarity with the the ory of the treatment; and 5) ongoing 
supervision. After the didactic trai ning in both ACT -PT and FFS,  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_81952]. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ first two cases will be closely 
monitored through weekly supervision and reviews of session videotapes.

 Recruitment. Participant s will be 50 Veterans  recruited from the PI’s Tobacco  Cessation Program at the 
Bedford VAMC. Based on the rate of PTSD and characteristics of Veterans in our clinic , [ADDRESS_89209] 3 months, we will modify  
recruitment procedures and/or add more recruitment sites  (e.g., Primary Care, Mental H ealth Clinic) .   
 Screening Procedures. Callers will be screened by [CONTACT_648]. Eligible participant s will be scheduled for an in -
person assessment with the PI, who will confirm study eligibility and obtain informed consent. After consent, 
participants will com plete  clinician -rated assessments and self -report measures (see below ). As in our stage 
1a trial, a psychiatrist will assess participants to determine whether they are medically cleared for the study.  
 Assessment Measures. A broad range of reliable and valid measures will be used (see Table 2).

 Diagnostic Measures:  The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -V (SCID -5-RV) is a reliable semi -
structured instrument that is the gold standard for diagnosing  mental health disorders [63, 64]. The Young 
Mania Rating Scale is a reliable and validated measure that will be used to screen for bipolar disorder [65]. 
Tobacco Use:  The Smoking History Questionnaire  (SHQ) [66] is a measure of smoking history and 
patterns.  The Questionnaire for Smoking Urges -Brief (QSU -Brief) [67, 68] is a 10 -item measure that evaluates 
the structure and function of smoking urges. The QSU -Brief has very good reliability ( =.78–.89).The 
Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence  (FTND) [69] is a [ADDRESS_89210] reliability [69, 70]. Smoking outcomes  will include a self -report of 
the number of cigarettes sm oked, verified by [CONTACT_81958] (CO) breath tests (< 8 ppm) [71]. Periods of 
sustained continuous abstinence and survival time to lapse and relapse will also be analyzed. Lapse will be 
defined as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_81954], and a relapse  is a return to regular 
smoking [72, 73]. A Timeline Follow -back  (TLFB) procedure will be used to assess time to first smoking lapse 
and time to first relapse, defined as the seventh day after qu it date on which smoking occurs  [74]. The 
Contemplation Ladder  is an 11-point self-report measu re of readiness to quit smoking . It has  good predictive 
and concurrent validity with the  likelihood of a serious quit attempt within 6 months [75]. 
 Social, Occupational, Mental Health and Physical Functioning: The Short Form 36 Health Survey  (SF-
36) is a 36 -item self -report measure of current physical, mental  health , and social  functioning  [76, 77], with 
excellent psychometric properties [76]. The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire  (Q-LES-
Q) [78, 79] is a commonly used self -report measure to assess quality of life in several domains: general 
activities, physical health, subjective feelings, leisure time activities, social relationships, work, and household 
duties. The Smoking  Cessation Quality of Life  Questionnaire  (SCQoL) is a self -reported measure designed to 
quantify to quantify the impact of  smoking  cessation on perceived  functioning  and well -being  [80]. The 
Sheehan Disability Scale  (SDS ) is a reliable and valid 3-item self -report  measure of overall disability, and 
assesses  social life, work/study, and family life functioning [81]. The Work and Social Adjustment Scale  
(WSAS) is a 5 -item measure of leisure activities, relationships, and home and work functioning [82].  
 Psychiatric Symptoms:  The PTSD Checklist  for DSM -5 (PCL -5) is a popular 20-item measure of PTSD 
symptoms  [83]. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI -II) is a 21-item measure of  depression severity [84]. 
 Process Measures : Experiential avoidance will be measured with the Acceptance and Action 
Questionnaire  (AAQ) [85], a 7-item self-report  measure of emotional avoidance and inaction. The Mindful 
Attention Awareness Scale  (MAAS) is a 15 -item scale of the ability to mindfully observe  the present moment  
[86]. The Valued Living Questionnaire is a self -report measure of the extent to which a person  is living in 
accordance with one’s values in everyday life [87]. All measures possess  good internal consistency, and 
construct validity. These measures will be used for m ediation a nalyses in the future clinical trial.   
 Treatment Satisfaction:  Client Satisfaction Questionnaire -8 (CSQ -8; [88]): This 8 -item scale measures 
patients’ perceived satisfaction  with treatment and has good internal consistency ( =.83-.93) [89]. The CSQ 
will be administered at the end of treatment (Session 1 0). 
 Retention and Noncompletion. We will use several strategies to increase retention : 1) W e will ask 
participant s to provide contact [CONTACT_81959] a release of information for people who will know how to get in 
touch with the participant ; 2) W e will call participants  and remind them about their appointments , 3) W e will pay 
participants  for their time and travel for sessions and follow -up assessments. We will interview participant s to 
determine reasons for study withdrawal and pr ovide referrals for other  services.  
Data Management and Statistical Analysis. Participant f iles will be kept in a locked cabinet and data files 
will be password -protected and encoded with ID numbers. IDs will be unrelated to any identifying information.  
Data will be checked for values out of the normal range, inconsistencies, omissions and errors.  
Preliminary analyses  and handling missing data.  Chi square and t -tests or non -parametric equivalent s 
will be used to compare demographics, and baseline levels of tobacco  dependence, PTSD severity , functional 
impairment , and motivation to quit smoking  in both groups. If differences are detected, we will  consider using 
these variables as covariates in subsequent analyses. To better characterize missing data, we will attempt to 
gather follow -up information for dropouts. If analyses show major differences between Veterans  who complete 
the study or drop -out, we will explore methods for imputing data, and stratify analyses based on any bias [90].  
 Primary analyses . Primary analyses will involve examination of the feasibility and acceptability of a RCT 
of ACT -PT. Feasibility will be verified by  [CONTACT_81960] 1) recruitment rates  (i.e., 3 Veterans per month) , 2) >90% 
fidelity of clinician adherence to the treatment protocol, and 3)  data retention ( i.e., ≥70% of participants who 
attend at least [ADDRESS_89211] -PT or FFS . An acceptable level of attrition will be ˂30% in each condition. 
We will also evaluate  the number of ACT -PT and FFS sessions attended, by [CONTACT_81961] 80%  of sessions  (8/10 ). We will also examine the willingness of 
Veterans  to be randomized with a goal of 80% of those approached who agree to randomization, the number 
of referrals from clinicians , ease of recruitment based on the average number of contacts needed to get 
consent and to schedule visits, the number of eligible participant s from the pool of potential participant s, and 
adherence and compliance to the treatment protocol (both counseling  and nicotine patch) by [CONTACT_81962]. We will compare Veteran  acceptability between groups  by [CONTACT_81963] t -test on the CSQ -8 [88]. We will compare attrition rates (<15% vs. >15%) between the 
two groups using a chi square and logistic regression analysis. We will also obtain qualitative data about the 
acceptability of the ACT -PT and FFS treatme nts.  
 Secondary analyses.  Efficacy is not our major analytic aim , given the preliminary nature of this study  [13]. 
We will examine differences in measures of tobacco use, PTSD  severity and quality of life to identify empi[INVESTIGATOR_81955] . We will 
examine group differences for biologically verified abstinence, duration of sustained continuous abstinence and 
time to lapse and relapse [91, 92]. Based on the intent -to-treat principle, all participant s randomized to 
treatment will be included in analyses. We will also look at individual trajectories of response to gain better 
insight into which participants  do particularly well (or poorly) in the two interventions. Effect sizes and 95% 
confidence inter vals will be used as only one element to estimate power and sample size to help plan for a 
Merit Review  study [13].  In addition, we will explore differences in tr eatment groups over time using HLM [93] 
(time x condition) on other outcomes of interest, including PTSD symptoms, functioning and  health -related 
quality of life . We will also examine the effects of treatment on the potential mediators (i.e., process variables), 
and the effect of these mediator s on treatment outcome to identify candidate mediators for future study.  
 Power analysis . Given the caveats of Leon et al. [13], our primary outcome(s) are feasibility and 
acceptability.  Consistent with the recommended stage model for behavioral therapy development [13, 14], the 
aim of this stage 1b pi[INVESTIGATOR_81956]. We expect 
ACT-PT will produce a medium treatment effect. In order to have .[ADDRESS_89212] would require n=125.  This is beyond the scope of a SPi[INVESTIGATOR_21392], and more 
appropriate for a stage II trial. A total sample size of 50 (25 per cell) is feasible and consistent with the 
recommendation of 15 -30 participant s per condition for a stage 1b study [14].

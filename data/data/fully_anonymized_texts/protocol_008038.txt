Overall Study Design: 
This is a Phase 1/[ADDRESS_1043934] of 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2).  Part [ADDRESS_1043935] dose- escalation 
design to determine the MTD or PAD of epacadostat when coadministered with nivolumab (defined as 
combination immunotherapy) i n subjects w ith select advanced  solid tumors  and lymphomas, including 
melanoma (MEL), NSCLC, colorectal cancer (CRC), SCCHN, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, and 
B-cell NHL or HL.   The study design is shown in Figure A 1 and Figure A2 below. 
Part 2 of Phase 1 will evaluate the preliminary safety of epacadostat in combination with nivolumab 
and several chemotherapy regimens (defined as combination chemo -immunotherapy) in subjects with 
SCCHN and NSCLC by [CONTACT_2329] a dose de-escalation design.  The starting dose of epacadostat in Part 2 
will be the RP2D of epacadostat selected for th e use of combination immunotherapy in Part 1.  Initial 
dose-finding cohorts in Part 2 will be expanded to safety expansion cohorts and will further evaluate 
tolerated dose(s) of epacadostat when given in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy 
regimens (see Figure A2). 
Phase 2 of the study will include 9 expansion cohorts in tumor types  tested in Phase 1 Part 1 (except 
DLBCL will be the only lymphoma permitted) with a) historically high activity under nivolumab 
monotherapy, and b) with historically low activity with nivolumab monotherapy.  In Phase 2 of the 
study, nivolumab will be administered at 240 mg intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks or 480 mg IV 
every 4 weeks for specific tumor types as described in Figure A1.

Phase 1 Dose-Finding and Safety Expansion (Part 1 and Part 2) 
In Part 1, for combination immunotherapy cohorts, a 3 + 3 + [ADDRESS_1043936] dose- escalation design will be 
used to assess the safety of epacadostat when given in combination with nivolumab. 
In Part 2, for combination chemo-immunotherapy cohorts, a (3 + 3) +  3 dose de-escalation study 
design will be used to evaluate the safety of epacadostat when administered in combination with 
nivolumab and chemotherapy regimen.  Part 2 will be initiated after Phase 1 Part 1 of the study is 
completed and the Phase 2 dose of epacadostat for the combination immunotherapy is determined. 
Combination  Immunotherapy Cohorts (Part 1) 
The starting dose of epacadostat when given in combination with nivolumab (3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks, Q2W) is [ADDRESS_1043937] 50 mg BID continuous or every other week cannot be combined safely with nivolumab 3 mg/kg, 
other alternative dose schedules (ie, other intermittent administration) of epacadostat may be tested, if 
needed, following the review of available safety data at the Dose Escalation/Cohort Review meetings.  
If an alternate schedule is tested and determined to b e safe, re-escalation of epacadostat according to 
Table A1 will proceed with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks.

a Approximately 3 to 9 subjects will be enrolled during dose escalation.  Additional subjects may be added to any dose level 
after determining the preliminary safety at that dose level for a minimum of 6 and maximum of 9 evaluable subjects per dose level.  Dose level numbers marked "a" and "b" may occur in parallel.  Oral administration of epacadostat  BID will 
occur on a daily basis unless indicated by [CONTACT_762273] 1 week followed by [CONTACT_762274].  Nivolumab administration will be 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks.  
b If 300 mg BID is not tolerated, an intermediate dose of 200 mg BID may be tested on either a continuous schedule or every-other-week schedule (see above for RP2D decision process).  
The DLT observat ion period will last for 6 weeks (42 days).  Three subjects will be treated initially at 
each dose level.  If 0 DLTs occur in a cohort of 3 subjects, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be treated at 
the next higher dose level.  If 1 of 3 subjects experience a DLT, that cohort will be expanded to 
6 subjects.  If  1 of 6 subjects experiences a DLT, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be treated at the next 
higher dose level.  If 2 of 6 DLT subjects experience a DLT, that cohort will be expanded to 9 subjects.  
If ≥ 2/3, 3/6, or 3/[ADDRESS_1043938] exceeded the MTD.  
If epacadostat 100 mg BID is deemed tolerable, up to 6 additional subjects (for a minimum of 6 evaluable subjects) will be enrolled 
to confirm the safety of the dose in combination with nivolumab.  
If 1 of 6 or < [ADDRESS_1043939] epacadostat 100 mg BID if it is deemed 
pharmacologically active and safe based on available data from Phase 1 cohorts.  
Note:  Up to 6 additional subjects may be enrolled into each cohort for a total of up to 9 evaluable 
subjects to further explore safety objectives (original 3- [ADDRESS_1043940] a total cohort size of 9). 
If epacadostat 300 mg BID is deemed tolerable, up to 6 additional subjects (for a minimum of 
6 subjects) will be enrolled before opening Phase 2 to further confirm the safety of the dose in 
combination with nivolumab.  If 1 of 6 or < 3 of 9 subjects experience DLTs, the remaining Phase 2 
cohorts may be opened with 300 mg BID as the RP2D after review ing the emerging data from Phase 2 
cohorts testing 100 mg BID.  
If 300 mg BID is tested and not tolerated, an intermediate dose of 200 mg BID may be tested  on either 
a continuous schedule or every-other- week schedule  or 100 mg BID may be selected as the RP 2D.  
The RP2D decision for the remaining Phase 2 cohorts will be made based on the available data from 
ongoing Phase 2 cohorts administered 100 mg BID.  If an MTD is not determined based on the data from Phase 1 and ongoing Phase 2 cohorts, then the remaining Phase 2 cohorts may be opened at a 
PAD of epacadostat (eg, 100 mg BID).

Phase 2 Dose Selection for Combination Immunotherapy (Part 1 of Phase 1)  
If 100 mg BID of epacadostat is determined as safe and tolerable in Phase 1  Part 1, Phase 2 of the 
study may begin to enroll in the I/O-naive MEL and NSCLC cohorts in parallel with the Part 1 
evaluation of epacadostat at 300 mg BID.  If 300 mg BID is then selected as the Phase 2 dose (RP2D), 
and either I/O -naive MEL or NSCLC cohort enroll s < 50% of total cohort (≤ 25 subjects) at 100 mg 
BID up to RP2D decision, then any additional subjects in that specific cohort being enrolled will be  
treated with epacadostat 300 mg BID  at the sponsor 's discretion, in lieu of opening new cohorts of 
I/O-naive MEL and NSCLC with 300 mg BID.  The same rule will apply to any additional Phase 2 
tumor cohorts (ie, CRC, ovarian cancer, etc) that may be  opened with epacadostat 100 mg BID before 
RP2D selection .  (Note:  Additional I/O -relapsed and I/O-refractory MEL c ohorts will be opened at 
100 mg BID). 
Combination  Chemo-Immunotherapy Cohorts  (Part 2 of Phase 1) 
The starting dose of epacadostat when given in combination with nivolumab (360 mg IV every 
3 weeks, Q3W) and chemotherapy will be  [ADDRESS_1043941] of  3 tumor cohorts ( 1 SCCHN cohort, and 
2 NSCLC cohorts) that  will enroll in parallel.  A minimum of 6  evaluable subjects will be enrolled in 
each tumor cohort at epacadostat 100 mg BID, and each cohort will be observed for 42 days for DLTs. 
In a tumor cohort the following rules will be applied to determine dose or dose de- escalation:  
•If ≤ 1 of 6 evaluable subjects has a DLT, then 100 mg BID will be used in a safety expansion cohort
(Cohort A, B, or C) for that specific tumor type.
•If [ADDRESS_1043942] a DLT, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled in the same cohort
(Cohort 1, 2, or 3).  If there are no additional DLTs (≤ 2 DLTs occurred in a total of 9 evaluable
subjects), then a safety expansion cohort (Cohort A or B or C) will start to enroll in that specific dose
level.
•If ≥ 2/3, 3/6, or ≥ 3/[ADDRESS_1043943]
this dose level as described above.
•Note:  If different MTDs are determined fo r the 2 NSCLC cohorts (combination
chemo-immunotherapy), 3 to 6 additional subjects may be enrolled in each NSCLC cohort to further
evaluate the safety profile before dose selection for safety expansion.
The doses of epacadostat to be evaluated and scenari os for de- escalation are summarized in Table A2.

Once 100 mg BID or 50 mg BID of epacadostat in combination chemo-immunotherapy cohorts is 
determined as the MTD or PAD, each of the tumor cohorts will be expanded for safety evaluation at 
that dose level of epacadostat.  Each of the safety expansion cohorts with combination 
chemo-immunotherapy will enroll up to 30 evaluable subjects.

For the purpose of making de cisions on dose  of epacadostat   from a safety perspective, subjects will be 
considered evaluable if they meet 1 of the following criteria:  
• In Part 1, in the combination immunotherapy cohorts, subjects must have received at least 2 out of 
the 3 scheduled nivolumab doses of 3 mg/kg through the 6- week (42-day) DLT observation period 
(only if the 1 missed dose was secondary to nonmedical reasons) and must have received at least 
75% of the cohort- specified dose of epacadostat during the DLT observation period.  
• In Part 2, in combination chemo-immunotherapy cohorts, subjects must have received [ADDRESS_1043945] 75% of the cohort- specified 
dose of epacadostat in during the 42 day DLT observation period. 
• In addition, subjects with dose delays during the 42-day DLT observation period of > 1 week for non-DLT events will be considered not evaluable for making decisions on dose escalation or dose 
de-escalation and should be replaced.  
Dose escalation  in Part 1 or dose de-escalation  in Part 2 of epacadostat  will be based on the number of 
dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) experienced during the DLT observation period.  Dose modifications 
should not be made during the DLT observation period without discussion with the medical monitor. 
Phase 2 Combination Immunotherapy Cohort Expansions  
The purpose of the cohort expansions in Phase 2  is to gather additional safety, tolerability, preliminary 
efficacy,  information regarding the combination of epacadostat  and nivolumab.  
Once the safety profile of active doses is characterized and the RP2D has been defined, the cohort 
expansions will be initiated at the RP2D.  However, the I/O -naive MEL and NSCLC cohorts may be 
opened using epacadostat 100 mg BID in parallel to testing 300 mg BID if the 100 mg BID dose of 
epacadostat is deemed tolerable in Phase 1  Part 1.  Treatment doses in the cohort expansion groups 
will not exceed the MTD.  Nine expansion cohorts in Phase 2 will be restricted to the same tumor 
types tested in Phase 1 Part 1 (except DLBCL will be the only lymphoma permitted in Phase 2), and 
Phase 2 will also include a cohort for glioblastoma.  The NSCLC and I/O -naive MEL cohorts, which 
have demonstrated activity with nivolumab monotherapy and are in Phase 3 evaluation in these 
indications, will be used to assess increased activity of the combination.  In Phase 2, there will be 
2 additional MEL cohorts to explore the activity of combination immunotherapy; one cohort will 
enroll subjects who relapsed on or after anti–programmed death  receptor-1(PD-1)/PD-L1 therapy (I/O 
relapsed) and the other cohort will enroll subjects who were ref ractory to prior anti–PD -1/PD-L1 
therapy (I/O refractory) (for I/O relapsed MEL cohort and I/O refractory MEL cohort definit ions, see 
eligibility section below).   Subjects who are enrolled in these 2 new MEL cohorts will be administered 
nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks whereas, subjects who are enrolled in I/O -naive MEL, NSCLC, 
CRC, SCCHN, ovarian cancer, DLBCL and glioblastom a cohorts will be administered nivolumab 
240 mg IV every 2 weeks.   Subjects enrolled in I/O MEL cohorts will be administered epacadostat 
100 mg BID; however, if there is no or minim al activity in tumor responses in these cohorts, 
alternative doses of epacadostat may be explored at the sponsor discretion.  The CRC, SCCHN, 
ovarian cancer, DLBCL, and glioblastoma cohorts will explore activity of the combination in tumors 
with preliminary, unknown, or historically low responses to nivolumab monotherapy.  Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansions will be performed throughout enrollment in the 
expansion cohorts.  If the cumulative incidence of Grade 3 or Grade 4 study treatment- related AEs 
exceeds 40% after enrolling the first 6  subjects in any of these cohorts , the findings will be reviewed 
and further enrollment will be interrupted until the sponsor(s), investigators, and regulatory authorities, 
if applicable, have determined the appropriate course of action.  If an expansion cohort is discontinued due to toxicity, a new cohort may be initiated at a previously tested lower dose level of epacadostat.  
In each of the NSCLC and I/O-naive MEL cohorts, approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled to allow 
for a more precise estimate of the ORR in these tumors where activity for nivolumab as monotherapy 
has been established.  The sample size for the I/O -relapsed MEL, I/O -refractory MEL,  CRC, ovarian, 
SCCHN, and DLBCL  cohorts will be approximately 25 subjects each.  The sample size for the 
glioblastoma cohort will be approximately 28 ( Table A4).

Dose-Limiting Toxicity :  For the purpose of guiding dose escalation, DLTs will be defined separately 
and will be determined based on the incidence, intensity, and duration of AEs that occur within the 
first 42 days (6 weeks) after  the initiation of epacadostat  dosing.  Adverse events will be graded 
according to the National Ca ncer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v4. 
For all subjects enro lled in Part 1 and Part 2 of Phase 1 and in Phase 2, participation has following 
main periods: 
Screening:   Up to 28 days. 
Treatment:  The treatment period with the combination immunotherapy (nivolumab + epacadostat ) 
will continue every 56 days and with the combination chemo-immunotherapy (nivolumab + epacadostat + chemotherapy) will continue every 21 days as long as the subjects are receiving benefit 
from treatment and ha ve not met any criteria for study withdrawal.  
End of Treatment (EOT):   + 5 days of withdrawal from study treatment.

Combination Immunotherapy and Chemo -Immunot herapy, Regimen , and Mode of 
Administration : 
Epacadostat is an investigational agent and  will be self-administered BID orally without regard to 
food and continued BID continuous or every other week during the 8- week cycle for an every -2-week 
dose schedule of nivolumab in combination immunotherapy cohorts.  In combination 
chemo-immunotherapy cohorts, epacadostat will be administered BID continuously during 21- day 
cycle (3 weeks) for as long as subject is deriving benefit and has not met any of the Protocol-defined 
conditions for treatment withdrawal.  Intrasubject dose escalation of epacadostat  is not permitted .   
The RP2D defined during Pha se 1 will be used for Phase 2 .  (Note:  Subjects enrolled in to 
I/O-refractory  and I/O-relapsed MEL cohorts i n Phase 2 will be administered e pacadostat 100 mg 
BID).  Intrasub ject dose escalation of epacadostat  is not allowed.   All BID doses will be taken morning 
and evening, approximately 12 hours apart.  If a dose is missed by [CONTACT_726] 4 hours, that dose should be skipped and the next scheduled dose should be taken at the usual time. 
Nivolumab will be administered  3 mg/kg as a 60-minute infusion every 2 weeks on Days 1, 15, 29, 
and 43 of each 8- week cycle of study therapy in Phase 1 Part 1.  In Phase 1 Part 2 , for the combinat ion 
chemo-immunotherapy cohorts, the dose of nivolumab will be 360 mg as a 30- minute infusion every 
3 weeks on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle . 
In the Phase 2 dose expansion of the combination immunotherapy cohorts, the dose of nivolumab will 
be 240 mg  as a 30-minute infusion every 2 weeks on Days 1, 15, 29, and 43 of each 8 -week cycle.

Subjects will have regularly scheduled study visits at the clinical site on Day 1 of every cycle (CX D1) 
and at designated timepoints within each cycle, as noted in the Schedule of Assessments.   Safety 
assessments will include laboratory assessments, vital sign collection, ECGs, and physical 
examinations.  Adverse events will be assessed continuously during the study and for [ADDRESS_1043968] recovered to baseline or are deemed 
irreversible by [CONTACT_093].  Both AEs and laboratory tests will be graded using the NCI CTCAE  
v4. 
Efficacy measures will be assessed  8 and 16 weeks after the start of treatment for subjects in the 
combination chemo -immunotherapy cohorts (Phase 1 Part 2) and then every 12 weeks thereafter.  All 
other subjects (Phase 1 Pa rt 1 and Phase 2) will have effic acy assessments every [ADDRESS_1043969] efficacy  assessments unt il the end of treatment; no effic acy assessments 
are required during the safety follow-up period.  Tumor responses will be derived for appropriate 
populations of subjects as defined b y RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_1043970] with additional cycles of study therapy will be based on tumor 
assessment (evaluation completed before the first dose in the next cycle) :  1) radiographic progression, 
2) clinical deterioration suggesting that no further benefit from treatment is likely, 3) intolerability  to 
therapy, 4) the subject meets criteria for discontinuation of study therapy, or 5) the subject has received 
2 years of nivolumab therapy.  
Subjects will enter the safety follow -up period upon discontinuation of treatment. 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
Planned Number of Subjects:   
Up to approximately 485 subjects may be enrolled in the overall study.  There will be approximately 
up to 207 subjects enrolled in the Phase 1 , which will include subjects enrolled in both dose escalation 
in combination immunotherapy cohorts as well as in combination chemo- immunotherapy cohorts and 
combination chemo-immunotherapy safety expansion cohorts.  In Phase 2, there will be up to 
approximately 278 subjects enrolled.

Principal Coordinating Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_762221]:  
Selection of Sample Size  
Phase 1 (Part 1 and Part 2):  Dose Finding and Safety Expansion:   For Part 1 of Phase 1 
dose-escalation of combination immunotherapy cohorts, the sample size at each dose depends on the 
number of observed toxicities (3 + 3 + 3 design) during DLT observation period.  Between 3 and 
9 subjects are expected to be treated during dose escalation in each cohort.  
For Part 2 of Phase 1 dose finding (dose de- escalation) of combination chemo-immunotherapy cohorts, 
the sample size at each dose also depends on the number of observed toxicities during DLT 
observation period.  Between 6 and 9 subjects are expected to be treated in each individual cohort.  For safety expansion cohorts of combination chemo-immunotherapy, up to 30 subjects will be enrolled in 
each tumor /combination chemo-immunotherapy specific cohorts.  
Phase 2 Cohort Expansion:   During cohort expansion, approximately 25 subjects are expected to be 
enrolled in each of the 4 low historic response expansion cohorts (CRC, SCCHN, ovarian cancer, and 
DLBCL) and in the 2 MEL cohorts (I/O relapsed and I/O refractory).  Approximately 50 subjects are 
expected in each of the 2 higher historic ORR cohorts (NS CLC and I/O-naive MEL).  For these 
cohorts, ORR and PFS will be analyzed  as dual primary endpoints.  The sample size yields a power of 
80% to detect either an increase in ORR by 17% to 26% from historical response rate of each tumor 
type, or a PFS rate at 6 months increased by 17% to 22% from historical survival probability.   This 
assumes a 1-sided alpha of 2.5% (based on Bonferroni adjustment due to dual primary endpoints for 
each independent cohort), 10% lost to follow-up, enrollment period of 6 to 10 months (depends on 
cohort), and 6 to 10 months of follow-up (depends on cohort) after last subject enrolled.  Twenty-eight 
subjects are expected to be enrolled in the glioblastoma cohort .  This yields a power of 80% to detect 
an OS rate at 9 months of 25% increase (Ha) from historical survival probability (H0).  This assumes a 
1-sided alpha of 5%, 10% lost to follow -up, enrollment period of [ADDRESS_1043971] enrolled . 
Statistical Analysis:  
Primary Analyses: 
Phase 1 (Part 1 and Part 2) and Phase 2 :  Subject enrollment, disposition, demographics, and medical 
history will be summarized at baseline.  DLTs will be summarized for each cohort.  Dose exposure and 
density will be calculated  for Phase 1.  AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_61132], and incidences will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_593296], related events, and events ≥ Grade 3.  Severity of AEs will be based on the CTCAE scale.  Quantitative safety variables and their changes 
from baseline (laboratory, vital signs) will be summarized with descriptive statistics.   Clinically 
significant abnormal values will be flagged and tabulated  based on predefined criteria.  
Phase 2:  The proportion of subjects with objective response (ORR) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_44847] 
(cohort).  The PFS and OS will be analyzed by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method.  The PFS/OS rate and the 
corresponding confidence interval using log-log transformation will be provided by [CONTACT_44847] (cohort) at 6 months for PFS and 9 months for OS.

Safety Monitoring Committee:    Due to the complexity of combination chemo-immunotherapy 
cohorts, a Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC) will review safety data at regular intervals throughout 
Phase 1 Part 2.  D etails regarding SMC membership, roles and responsibilities of the committee will 
be specified  in the SMC charter.

1. INTRODUCTION
The INCB [ZIP_CODE]-204 study is a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and cohort expansion study of the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of epacadostat administered in combination with nivolumab.  
Epacadostat (INCB024360) is a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), and nivolumab is a fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody that blocks the programmed death receptor- 1 (PD-1), that is, an anti–PD -1.  
Targeting the immune system is a proven and effective approach for the treatment of cancer, and immunotherapy is now an accepted standard of care in several tumor types.  The blocking of immune cell co -inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T- lymphocyte –associated protein 4 
(CTLA-4) by [CONTACT_40105][INVESTIGATOR_125]; PD-1 by [CONTACT_762280]; and programmed cell death 
ligand-1 (PD-L1) by [CONTACT_762281] a critical mechanism for redirecting the 
host immune response against the tumor ( Chen and Mellman 2013).  It is anticipated that the 
combination of the oral IDO1 inhibitor ( epacadostat ) with anti–PD-1 (nivolumab) or with 
nivolumab and cytoto xic agents (chemotherapy regimens) will demonstrate adequate safety and 
tolerabilit y at pharmacologically -relevant doses  so as to permit further clinical testing . 
For a thorough discussion of the pharmacology of epacadostat and nivolumab, refer to the Investigator's Brochure ( eIB) and the nivolumab Investigator' s Brochure ( nIB). 
1.1. Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades ( Dimery and Hong 1993, Disis 2010).  The inability 
of the immune system to  control tumor growth does not appear to result from an inability to 
recognize the tumor as foreign.  Tumor cells have been shown to evade immune destruction despi[INVESTIGATOR_762226] -avidity 
T cells that are specific for these antigens ( Boon and van der Bruggen 1996 , Ercolini et al 2005).  
Histologic evaluation of many human cancers show extensive infiltration by [CONTACT_165879] ( Gadgeel et al 2016, Galon  et al 2006 ), suggesting that the immune system 
responds less effectively to malignancy.  These observations have led to the hypothesis that dominant mechanisms of immune tolerance or immune suppression are responsible for the immune system 's inability to effectively respond in a way that consistently results in rejection.  
There are a number of inhibitory mechanisms that have been identified to be involved in tumor-mediated immune suppression and include expression of the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which can engage the inhibitory receptor PD- 1 on activated T cells; the presence of the 
tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme IDO1, which exploits the exquisite sensitivi ty of T cells to 
tryptophan depletion and tryptophan metabolites; and infiltration with FoxP3
+ regulatory T cells 
(Treg), which can mediate extrinsic suppression of effector T- cell function .  Therefore, agents 
that target these negative regulatory pathways , and thereby [CONTACT_762282] 
T cells present in the tumor, may be beneficial in the clinic.  
1.1.1. Inhibition of PD -[ADDRESS_1043985] stimulated by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses,

including autoimmune reactions.  Programmed death receptor-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_426060]1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4, which has been shown to 
negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or 
PD-L2; Talmadge et al 2007 , Usubütün et al  1998).  T he mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_1043986] from that of CTLA -4, as both 
molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971] ( Hiraoka 2010, Nobili et al 2008).  
Programmed death receptor -1 has been shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes, 
including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, Tregs, and natural killer cells ( Hodi and 
Dranoff 2010, Kloor 2009).  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4-CD8- (double negative) T cells as well as on subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells 
(DCs; Hillen et al 2008).  The ligands for PD- 1 (PD-L1 and PD- L2) are constitutively expressed 
or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including nonhematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors ( Lee et al 2008, Leffers et al 2009, Nishimura  et al 2000, Hiraoka 2010).  
Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_1043987] notably on 
vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  Programm ed death 
ligand-2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD- L1 
serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral tissues ( Hiraoka 2010).  Although 
healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express 
abundant levels of this T- cell inhibitor.  Programmed death receptor -1 has been suggested to 
regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma  (MEL; Liotta et al 2010 ).  
This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and 
should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
Nivolumab is a fully human Ig G4 antibody that blocks PD-1, blocks interaction with PD -L1 and 
PD-L2, and restores T -cell antitumor function ( Brahmer et al 2010).  Nivolumab has been 
approved as monotherapy in the [LOCATION_002] for metastatic NSCLC that has progressed on or 
after platinu m-based chemotherapy, for advanced RCC after previous antiangiogenic therapy, for 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has relapsed or progressed after autologous hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation and post-transplantation brentuximab vedotin, for recurrent or 
metastatic SCCHN with disease progression on or af ter platinum-based therapy, for locally 
advanced metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or after 
platinum-containing chemotherapy or disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or 
adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy , for microsatellite instability -high or 
mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer  and for melanoma in both the adjuvant 
and advanced/metastatic setting ( Opdivo 2018).  Nivolumab is approved in the European Union 
as monotherapy or in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_762227] (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma , as monotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy, 
for advanced RCC after prior therapy, for recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, for metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or after platinum- containing chemotherapy , 
and for Hodgkin lymphoma following autologous stem cell transplant and treatment with 
brentuximab vedotin ( Opdivo SmPC 2018).

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1043988] has focused on the role of IDO1 as a mechanism of induction of tolerance to 
malignancy ( Godin-Ethier et al 2011).  Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is a heme-containing 
monomeric oxidoreductase that catalyzes the degradation of the essential amino acid tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine.  Kynurenine can be subsequently metabolized through a series of 
enzymatic steps to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.  Indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase is the first 
rate-limiting enzyme in one of the brea kdown pathways of tryptophan.  In another pathway, 
tryptophan hydroxylase catalysis of tryptophan leads to the formation of serotonin and melatonin.  
The expression and activity profiles of IDO1 are distinct from those of tryptophan dioxygenase, an enzyme predominantly expressed in the liver that catalyzes the same enzymatic reaction as IDO1 and maintains proper tryptophan balance in response to dietary uptake.  In contrast to 
tryptophan dioxygenase, IDO1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, with particularly high levels 
found in areas of contact [CONTACT_398823] (eg, gut, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], placenta, spleen), consistent with a role for regulating tryptophan metabolism in a local 
microenvironment ( Mellor and Munn 2004).  Within the immune system, IDO1 activity is 
specifically induced in cells such as DCs and macrophages at localized sites of inflam mation 
(Munn and Mellor 2007).  
IDO1-driven oxidation of tryptophan results in a strong inhibitory effect on the development of 
T-cell−mediated responses by [CONTACT_47506] T-cell activation and inducing T-cell apoptosis 
(Mellor et al 2003).  Both the reduction in local tryptophan levels and the production of 
tryptophan catabolites that are inhibitory to cell proliferation contribute to the 
immunosuppressive effects ( Frumento et al 2002).  IDO1 activity also promotes the 
differentiation of naive T cells to cells with a regulatory phenotype (Treg ; Fallarino et al 2006).  
Since increased Treg activity has been shown to promote tumor growth, and Treg depletion has 
been shown to allow an otherwise ineffectual antitumor immune response to occur ( Zou 2006), 
IDO1 expansion of Tregs may provide an additional mechanism whereby [CONTACT_165881]1 could promote 
an immunosuppressive environment. 
The biological relevance of IDO1 inhibition to immune tolerance was first demonstrated when it 
was shown that treating mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the IDO1 pathway, 
1-methyl-tryptophan, could break the tolerogenic state that protects allogeneic concepti from the 
maternal immune system ( Munn et al 1998).  A critical role for IDO1 in immunomodulation has 
been confirmed in numerous animal models, including models of allograft tolerance, inflammation, and cancer ( Mellor and Munn 2004).  While IDO1 inhibition can exacerbate 
disease in models of autoimmune disorders ( Mellor and Munn 2004), IDO1 null mice show no 
evidence of susceptibility to developi[INVESTIGATOR_165809] ( Mellor et al 2003), suggesting that IDO1 inhibition in a therapeutic setting  
may produce minimal side effects in subjects without pre -existing autoimmune conditions. 
Within the context of cancer, there are several lines of evidence to suggest that IDO1 is a key regulator of the immunosuppressive mechanisms responsible for tumor escape from immune 
surveillance.  Several groups have demonstrated that blockade of IDO1 activity can directly influence the ability of tumor -bearing animals to reject tumors ( Uyttenhove et al 2003, 
Muller et al 2005).  In addition, studies with 1- methyl-tryptophan demonstrate that IDO1  
inhibition dramatically increases the efficacy of various chemotherapeutic agents (eg, platinum

compounds, taxane derivatives, and cyclophosphamide) without increased toxicity 
(Muller et al 2005).  Although the specific mechanisms responsible for this potentiation remain 
to be fully elucidated, the effects were not observed in T- cell−deficient animals, suggesting that 
the results may be the consequence of the disablement of immunosuppressive mechanisms that exist within the tumor microenvironment. 
Based on studies examining serum levels of tryptophan and kynurenine, IDO1 appears to be 
chronically activated in subjects with cancer, and IDO1 activation correlates with more extensive disease (Huang et al 2010, Weinlich  et al 2007).  IDO1 has subsequently been found to be 
overexpressed by a wide variety of human tumor cell types, as well as by [CONTACT_551685]-draining lymph nodes ( Uyttenhove et al 2003, Munn et al 2004).  Increased expression 
of IDO1 in tumor cells has been shown to be an independent prognostic variable for reduced 
overall survival (OS) in subjects with MEL and ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer  
(Okamoto et al 2005, Brandacher  et al 2006, Ino et al 2006, Nakamura et al 2007, 
Witkiewicz et al 2008, Hamid  et al 2009).  
Together, these results suggest that the IDO1 pathway is a key regulatory element responsible for 
the induction and maintenance of tumor immune tolerance.  Small molecule inhibitors of IDO1 may provide an innovative and tractable method to treat advanced malignancies, either alone or 
in combination with chemotherapeutics and/or immunotherapy- based strategies.  
1.1.3. Combined Immune Checkpoint Inhibition  
Blockade of immune inhibitory pathways is emerging as an important therapeutic modality for 
the treatment of cancer as evidenced by [CONTACT_165890]-4 and PD-1/PD-L1.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a fully human  IgG1 monoclonal antibody blocking 
CTLA-4, improved OS in patients with advanced MEL (Hodi et al 2010, Robert et al 2011).  
Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 antibody blocking PD-1, produced durable objective responses in patients  with MEL, RCC, and NSCLC ( Topalian et al 2012, Hamid et al 2013, Wolchok 
et al 2013).  Although these single agents have antitumor activity, multiple immune inhibitory 
mechanisms are present concurrently wi thin the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that 
combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_762228] ( Quezada and Peggs 2013). 
For example, CTLA -[ADDRESS_1043989] alone 
(Curran et al 2010, Selby  [CONTACT_2297] 2013).  
On the basis of these observations, a P hase 1 study was conducted to investigate the safety and 
efficacy of combined CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade (with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762], 
respectively) in subjects with advanced MEL .  The objective response rate ( ORR; according to 
modified WHO criteria) f or all subjects in the concurrent regimen group was 40%.  Evidence of 
clinical activity (conventional, unconfirmed, or immune- related response or stable disease [SD] 
for ≥ 24 weeks) was observed in 65% of subjects.   
In 17 subjects treated at the maximum d oses associated with an acceptable level of adverse 
events (AEs), 53% had an objective response compared with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79285] (10.9%), 
all with a tumor reduction of ≥ 80%.  Grade 3 or 4 AE s related to therapy occurred in 53% of

subjects in the concurrent  regimen group but were qualitatively similar to previous experience 
with monotherapy and were generally reversible.  Among subjects in the sequenced -regimen 
group, 18% had Grade 3 or 4 AE s related to therapy , and the ORR was 20%.  Grade 3 or 4 AE s, 
regardless of attribution, were observed in 72% of subjects , and Grade 3 or 4 treatment- related 
AEs were noted in 53% of subjects.  Serious AE s (SAEs) related to the treatment were reported 
in 49% of subjects  in the concurrent regimen group.  Common Gra de 3 or 4 selected AEs that 
were related to therapy included hepatic events (15%), gastrointestinal events (9%), and renal 
events (6%).  Isolated cases of pneumonitis and uveitis were observed.  In both regimen groups, 
treatment -related AEs were manageable and generally reversible with the use of 
immunosuppressants (or hormone- replacement therapy for endocrinopathies) according to 
previously- established algorithms ( Yervoy 2012). 
As described above, IDO1 is another negative regulatory mechanism that contributes to tumor-derived immune suppression.  In preclinical models, IDO1 inhibition has been shown to 
synergize with blockade of either anti −CTLA-4 or anti−PD-1/PD-L1 in delaying tumor growth 
and increasing OS (Holmgaard  et al 2013, Spranger  et al 2013).  This effect was shown to be 
T-cell dependent, leading to enhanced T- cell proliferation and interleukin -2 production within 
the tumor and to a marked increase in the effector -to-regulatory T- cell ratios in the tumor.  
In 119 diffuse large B -cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) patients  treated with first-line (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone ) chemotherapy, IDO expression 
on lymphoma cells and DC s was associated with both a decrease in complete remission and a 
decrease in OS rate (Ninomiya  et al 2011).  In a survey of 57 newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma ( NHL) patients with diverse histologies including DLBCL, mantle  cell lymphoma , 
and follicular lymphoma (FL), expression of IDO, mRNA , and protein were higher in the NHL 
tissues than in reactive lymph node tissues, and upregulation of IDO 1 was correlated with 
advanced clinical stage, larger tumors, and poor prognosis ( Liu et al 2014), suggesting a 
fundamental contribution of the local crosstalk between malignant lymphocytes and their 
microenvironment to lymphomagenesis.  In a Phase 1 study of subjects with relapsed FL treated 
with the combination of the PD-1 inhibitor pi[INVESTIGATOR_762229], of 29 evaluable subjects, 19 achieved ORs for an ORR of 66%, 15 (52%) had CRs, and 4 (14%) had partial responses 
(PRs), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 21.1 months ( Westin et al 2012).  A 
recent study suggests that PD -[ADDRESS_1043990] ( Armand et al 2013 ).  These promising 
data suggest a strong foundation for immunomodulatory combinations . 
In an ongoing, Phase 1 , open-label, dose-escalation study of epacadostat  with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
(3 mg/kg intraveno usly [IV]), daily doses of epacadostat have been evaluated in 21- day cycles in 
3 cohorts thus far (300 mg, 100 mg, and 25 mg twice daily [ BID]).  Seven subjects were enrolled 
at 300 mg BID.  When 5 subjects developed clinically significant alanine aminotra nsferase 
(ALT) elevations afte r 30 to 76 days on treatment, enrollment was stopped.  The ALT elevations 
were reversible with corticosteroids and treatment discontinuation.  Six of 7  subjects had 
evaluable scans  either before discontinuation or within a few weeks of discontinuation of one or 
both agents, and all showed immune -related SD.  Enrollment was restarted at 25 mg BID (n  = 8), 
where [ADDRESS_1043991] with progression of prior extensive liver metastases had a dose- limiting toxicity 
(DLT; Grade 3 aspartate ami notransferase [ AST] elevation).  Immune- related AEs (irAEs) were

(HPV)-positive tumors and HPV-negative tumors, although HPV positivity does appear to 
correlate with a higher probability of PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment 
(Lyford-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_110069] 2013).  In early clinical studies, a subject  with metastatic SCCHN was treated 
with the anti–PD -L1 monoclonal antibody MDPL3280A and experienced a response by [CONTACT_762284] ( Herbst et al 2013).  Additional studies of anti–PD -1 and anti–PD -L1 
agents in t he setting of metastatic SCCHN are ongoing.  
In summary, both IDO1 and PD-[ADDRESS_1043995] been shown to suppress T- cell−mediated antitumor 
immunity , and IDO1 and the PD-[ADDRESS_1043996] demonstrated promising data in the NSCLC patient population.  
In 38 subjects with previously treated advanced NSCLC administered  10 mg/kg nivolumab every 
2 weeks, an ORR of 24% as measured by [CONTACT_165883] (irRC ; Wolchok 
et al 2009) was observed, with similar  results using RECIST v1.1 criteria (21%).  Most responses 
were observed by [CONTACT_165884] 9.  Median duration of response (DOR) 
by [CONTACT_762285] a median duration of follow-up of 9 months (minimum, 
6 months).  Pretreatment tumor PD -L1 expression was a statistically significant predictor of 
response.  In subjects with evaluable tumor PD-L1 expression, the majority of  confirmed 
responses by [CONTACT_393]  v1.1 criteria (and irRC) occurred in subjects  with tumors strongly positive 
for PD-L1.  The most common AEs were fatigue, rash , and pruritus (16% each).  The incidence 
of diarrhea  was 13% (only Grade 1 or 2 reported).  Only 1 drug -related Grade 3  or 4 AE 
(Grade 3 pulmonary edema; 3%) was seen ( Garon et al 2013).  
In a Phase 1 study of nivolumab, 42% and 24% of heavily pretreated subjects with NSCLC were 
alive at 1 and 2 years, respectively, based on Kaplan- Meier estimates, and median survival was 
9.9 months.  In all treated subjects, the ORR  was 17% as measured by [CONTACT_393] v1.[ADDRESS_1043997] AEs with potential immunologic etiologies, defined as AEs that require more 
frequent monitoring and/or specific interventions, included rash, diarrhea, and pruritus (Brahmer et al 2013).  In addition to PD-[ADDRESS_1043998] also shown

binding to its receptors, including PD-1 and B7.1, has shown similar efficacy.  In a Phase 1 study 
that included subjects with both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC, ORR was 
24% (9/37 subjects ), and at the time of the abstract , all responses were ongoing and improving.  
The 24-week PFS was 46%.   Analysis of biomarker data from archival tumor samples 
demonstrated a correlation between PD -L1 status and efficacy.  Subjects with PD -L1−positive 
tumors showed an ORR of 100% (4/4), while subjects who were PD -L1 tumor status −negative 
had an ORR of 15% (4/26).  The response rate in former or current smokers was 25% of subjects 
(8/37) versus 16% of subjects (1/6) who were never smokers.  The incidence of Grade 3/4 AEs, 
regardless of attribution, was 34%, including pericardial effusion (6%), dehydration (4%), 
dyspnea (4%), and fatigue (4%).  No Grade 3 to Grade 5 pneumonitis or diarrhea was reported 
(Soria et al 2013).  Targeting the IDO1 enzyme has been studied in subjects  with metastatic 
NSCLC as well in the form of vaccination with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_762230]1.  In the P hase 1 
study, no severe toxicities occurred.  One of 15 HLA- A2−positive subjects  treated developed a 
PR after 1 year of vaccine treatment , and SD of ≥ 8.5 months was reported in another 6 subjects .  
The median survival was 25.9 months, and long- lasting PR  and SD were seen in 47% of the 
subjects.  Expression of IDO1 was detected in 9 of 10 tumor biopsy specimens by 
[CONTACT_9064] ( Iversen et al 2014).  
Given the recent benefits in OS achieved with immunotherapeutics in MEL  and prostate cancer, 
researchers have posited that immunotherapy approaches may offer promise in other 
difficult-to-treat cancers such as glioblastoma ( Heimberger  and Sampson 2011).  Immunologic 
factors have clinically been associated with glio blastomas:  a reduced risk of malignant gliomas 
and longer survival is observed in patients with elevated IgE levels compared with  those with 
normal levels ( Schwartzbaum et al 2012, Turner 2012, Lin et al 2011, Schlehofer  et al 2011).  In 
addition, immune checkpoint receptors such as PD- L1/B7-H1/CD274, a transmembrane receptor 
ligand and negative regulator of T- cell signaling, have been reported t o be upregulated in 
glioblastoma ( Parsa et al 2007, Jacobs  et al 2009, Berghoff  et al 2014).  Studies have also 
suggested an association between malignancy grade of astrocytic t umors and tumor cell PD- L1 
expression ( Wilmotte  et al 2005, Yao  et al 2009).  
Currently for glioblastoma, bevacizumab is approved as single agent for patients with progressive disease (PD) following prior therapy.  This approval was based on demonstration of 
durable ORRs  observed in 2 single- arm studies (AVF3708g and NCI 06-C-0064E ; 
Avastin 2014).  The ORR was 25.9% in Study AVF3708g, with a median DOR of 4.2 months, 
and was 19.6% in Study NIC 06-C-0064E, with a median DOR  of 3.9 months.  Another 
multicenter, randomize d, noncomparative Phase 2 study evaluating bevacizumab alone or in 
combination with irinotecan in recurrent glioblastoma  reported 6-month PFS rate s of 42.6% and 
50.3%, respectively an d median OS  rates of 9.2 months and 8.7 months, respectively

in the corticosteroid -free arm (Arm A; median of 10.4 months both by [CONTACT_762286]) was 
consistent with that observed in other ipi[INVESTIGATOR_762235]:  
temozolomide (median DOR = 2 months).  The OS rates observed in Arm A of this study (26% 
at Year 2) are consistent with survival data observed in other ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79285] (10 mg/kg) studies and appear favorable to the survival recorded in historical studies, where 
2-year survival is approximately 10% ( Parsa et al 2007). 
1.1.5. Overview of 5 -Fluorouracil and Cisplatin in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head 
and Neck  
Cisplatin-based combination therapy has become one of the major cornerstones for treatment of 
subjects with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN with approximately 35% res ponse rates 
(Jacobs et al 1992).  Responses are often short lasting, and recurrent disease is often resistant to 
second-line chemotherapy ( Dimery and Hong 1993).   Further investigation led to combination 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_762236] ( Gibson et al 2005, Bourhis et al 2006, Vermorken  et al 
2008).  5-FU, cisplatin, and cetuximab have become the standard of care for treatment of 
recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer due to higher response rate being achieved in 
chemotherapy  combination regimen compared to single agents ( Sacco and Cohen 2015).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_762237], OS in advanced and recurrent 
SCCHN requires further investigations with new combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_762238].  In 2016, the approval of nivolumab by [CONTACT_762287].  Chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor combinations may be crucial for the broadest applications to achieve improved patient outcomes. 
1.1.6. Overview of Platinum- Based Doublet Chemotherapy Compared With 
Immunotherapy in Squamous and Nonsquamous Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer  
Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (PT- DC), such as paclitaxel and pemetrexed, has become 
the standard of care first-line therapy for NSCLC patients (without sensitizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_8199]  [EGFR] mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ ALK] translocation) with 
squamous and nonsquamous histologies, respectively ( NCCN 2016, Novello et al 2016).  
However, most patients  survive less than a year , and there a re limited treatment options for 
squamous NSCLC ( NCCN 2016).  
Randomized studies comparing various PT- DC regimens in NSCLC have shown similar efficacy 
results, with ORRs ranging from 15% to 32%, median PFS ranging from  4.0 to 5.1 months, and 
median OS ranging from 8.1 to 10.3 months.  One- and 2-year OS rates ranged from 30% to 44% 
and 10% to 19%, respectively ( Kelly et al 2001, Sandler  et al 2006, S cagliotti et al 2002, 
Scagliotti et al 2008, Schiller  et al 2002).  Bevacizumab and maintenance therapy with 
pemetrexed have improved clinical outcomes ( Barlesi et al 2014, Scagliotti et al 2014, 
Patel et al 2013), but most subjects will eventually progress ( Chang 2011).

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1044000]-line advanced NSCLC.  Preliminary data from this study show that confirmed ORRs with 
nivolumab plus PT-DC ranged from 33% to 47% across arms, which compare favorably with 
previously reported rates of 15% to 32% for PT- DC alone ( Rizvi et al 2016).  Median OS was 
longer than expected in subjects on PT- DC alone (8.1-10.3 months).  OS for nivolumab 5 mg/kg 
administered in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin was particularly notable; median OS 
was not reached at the time of the reporting period ( 8.8-30.1 months), and 57% of subjects were 
still alive after a media n follow-up time of more than 2 years.  Although sample sizes were 
small, 1-year OS rates (50% to 87%) seemed similar t o those seen with nivolumab monotherapy 
(73%) in [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] (CHECKMATE -012; Gettinger  et al 2016).  Overall, the safety profile 
of the combination arm was similar to the PT-DC monotherapy arm.  Most treatment -related 
AEs reported during combination cycles were those associated with PT-DC and managed by 
[CONTACT_762288], rather than discontinuation. 
Activity of PD -1 monotherapy over a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen in subjects with 
previously untreated advanced NSCLC with PD-L1+ (expression ≥ 50% on tumor cells) was 
demonstrated in an open -label Phase 3 study ( Reck et al 2016).  The pembrolizumab  
monotherapy group showed a significantly longer media n PFS of 10.[ADDRESS_1044001] ratio (HR  = 0.50; 95% confidence interval [ CI], 
0.37 to 0.68; p < 0.001).  OS at 6  months was 80.2% in the pembrolizumab group versus 72.4% 
in the chemotherapy  group (HR  for death  = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.89; p = 0.005).  The ORR 
was greater in subjects treated with PD -1 inhibitor versus investigator- choice chemotherapy 
(45% vs 28%).  T reatment-related AEs of any grade were less frequent (occurring in 73.4% vs 
90.0% of subjects), as were ≤ Grade  3 treatment- related AEs (26.6% vs 53.3%).  Collectively, 
these results may provide the basis for PD-[ADDRESS_1044002] -line setting for advanced NSCLC without any overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_762239]. 
Another Phase 2 study investigate d the efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab and 
pemetrexed/carboplatin versus pemtrexed/carboplatin alone i n subjects with advanced 
nonsquamous NSCLC  in the first- line setting .  With a median follow -up of 19 months, the 
chemo-immunotherapy combination showed a significant improvement in ORR of 57% versus 
32% and median PFS of 19.0 months versus 8.9 months ( Borghaei et al 2017 ).  This combination 
received accelerated approval from the FDA in May 2017. 
Collectively, all these data show that the immunogenic effects of conventional chemotherapy and rapid emergence of chemotherapy resistance may pr esent as a good rationale to combine 
chemotherapy doublets with immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors 
(Schvartsman  et al 2016, Rizvi et al 2016).  Combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with 
platinum-based doublets may also provide a rapid and large initial response through the action of the cytotoxic chemotherapy, thus releasing tumor antigens in the tumor micro environment to be 
recognized by [CONTACT_27639].   This may later be durable and trigger a response with 
checkpoint inhibition.

further amplify an immune res ponse by [CONTACT_762289].  
Expression of IDO1 represents an early checkpoint that results in a diminished immune response and tolerance to tumor antigen. 
Another common ra te-limiting step is the expression of PD -L1 as a distal immune modulator 
expressed in 20% to 50% of human cancers ( Hiraoka 2010, Herbst  et al 2013), including, but not 
limited to , the ones selected for investigation in this study :  advanced or metastatic NSCLC, 
MEL, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer ( CRC), SCCHN, and DLBCL.  Expression of IDO and 
PD-1/L1 have been found to be increased in NSCLC as the disease progresses, and expression of 
these markers in tumor cells has been associated with shorter subject survival ( Iversen 
et al 2014).  Anti−PD-1 monotherapy response rates of 17% to 24% have been reported in 
refractory NSCLC (Garon et al 2013, Brahmer  et al 2013) with survival medians of 8 to 
18 months. There is an urgent need for novel treatment interventions to improve clinical response for 
patients suffering from glioblastoma.  Use of an inhibitor of PD-L1 in mouse glioblastoma 
models suggests benefit when given in combination with radiation therapy ( Zeng et al 2013).  In 
similar studies using an orthotopic, immunocompetent murine glioblastoma model, Reardon et al 
(2014) recently demonstrated that anti –PD-1 therapy eradicated established tumors in 
approximately 50% of treated animals.  Long-term survivors did not grow tumors upon 
intracranial rechallenge, suggesting the generation of tumor -specific immune memory responses 
(Reardon et al 2014).  Furthermore, in recent studies combining an IDO1 inhibitor with  
anti–PD-1 therapy increased the long- term survival rate to approximately 75% of treated animals 
(Wainwright et al 2014, Reardon  et al 2016).  
Although many studies have evaluated the efficacy of anti–PD -1, anti–PD -L1, and anti–CTLA -[ADDRESS_1044004]-line treatments for metastatic MEL (Redman et al 2016), the available data are limited for 
the efficacy of a combination of checkpoint inhibitors as the second- line treatment following 
anti–PD-1 or anti–PD -L1 monotherapy.  There is currently no effective therapy for metastatic 
MEL that is relapsed or refractory after anti –PD-1/PD-L1 treatment ; thus it remains as a 
substantial unmet medical need for advanced or metastatic MEL.  Early data from a Phase 2 
study of nivolumab (anti–PD -1) versus chemotherapy (CHECKMATE -037) in subjects with 
advanced MEL who progressed after anti–CTLA -4 therapy showed activity with an improved 
ORR in subjects who were administered nivolumab compared with subjects who were administered chemotherapy ( Weber et al 2015).  Additionally, a Phase 1/2 study of 
pembrolizumab (anti–PD -1) versus investigator- choice chemotherapy for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -refractory 
MEL (KEYNOTE -002) also demonstrated clinical activity with improved ORR, PFS, and OS in 
subjects who progressed after anti –CTLA-4 therapy and were administered pembrolizumab , 
compared with subjects who were administered chemotherapy ( Ribas et al 2015) .  Most

recently, a Phase 1/2 study of pembrolizumab with epacadostat (KEYNOTE-037) also showed 
an improved ORR and disease control rate in advanced MEL (Gangadhar  et al 2016).  These data 
support promising activity of epacadostat in combination with an anti–PD -1 inhibitor in subjects 
with advanced MEL  and likely activity of the combination immunotherapy in subjects who 
progressed after previous PD-1/PD- L1 therapy. 
In APR 2018, an eDMC review of  ECHO-301/KEYNOTE -252 study, a P hase 3 study 
evaluating the anti –PD-[ADDRESS_1044005] -line treatment in subjects with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma, concluded that the co primary endpoint of improvement in PFS  was not met 
(HR = 1.00; 95% CI:  0.83, 1.21) and that the coprimary endpoint of improvement in OS  was 
also not expected to reach statistical significance  (HR = 1.13; 95% CI:  0.86, 1.49).   Based on 
these results, and on the recommendation of the eDMC, the study was stopped.  T he safety 
profile observed in the ECHO-301/KEYNOTE -[ADDRESS_1044006] assumes that the T cells are essentially exhausted (and thus tolerant of 
the tumor) and that this exhaustion may be reversed by [CONTACT_39627]-[ADDRESS_1044007] will concurrently decrease infiltration of regulatory CD4+ cells and 
immune-suppressive cytokines.   
 
 
 
 
 
1.2.2. Rationale for Combining PD- [ADDRESS_1044008] that some chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_762240] (ICD), 
elimination of immunosuppressive cells, or se nsitization of tumor cells to immune effector cells 
(Apetoh et al 2015).  Platinum agents have demonstrated immunogenic effects via ICD and 
enhancement of effector immune response through PD-L1 receptor expression ( Hato et al 2014).  
Paclitaxel and 5-FU have been shown to restore antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells ( Sevko et al 
2013, Vincent  et al 2010).  Given these findings, the combination of chemotherapy with 
immunotherapy is a rational choice, especially in patients for whom these chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_762241].   Initial treatment options for patients with recurrent or metastatic solid 
tumors include various chemotherapy agents (platinum agent [cisplatin or carboplatin], 5- FU, or 
taxanes), either alone or in combination, and the biologic agent cetuximab ( NCCN 2016).  In 
patients with non-nasopharyngeal SCCHN, the addition of cetuximab to a platinum agent [cisplatin or carboplatin] and 5- FU (EXTREME regimen) prolonged median OS from 7.4 to 
10.1 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.80; p = 0.04) and median PFS from 3.3 to 5.6 months (HR = 0.54; p < 0.001) compared with a platinum agent−5- FU doublet.  Additionally, ORR 
increased from 20% with platinum/5- FU to 36% with the EXTREME regimen (p < 0.001; 
Vermorken  et al 2008).  Based on these results, the EXTREME regimen has become the standard

of care for subjects with non-nasopharyngeal SCCHN in the recurrent and metastatic setting 
(NCCN 2016). 
While AEs of ≥ Grade 3 were comparable between the treatment groups (EXTREME:  82%; platinum/5- FU:  76%), the most common AEs observed with EXTREME (anemia, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia) and cetuximab- specific AEs (Grade 3 skin  toxicities, Grade 3/4 
infusion-related reactions) limit the use of this regimen to younger patients with good 
performance status.   In those who are eligible to receive this regimen, many will stop therapy 
prematurely due to toxicity, as demonstrated by a 20% discontinuation rate due to AEs in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study ( Vermorken  et al 2008).   Common comorbidities in patients with SCCHN 
such as diminished hepatic, cardiac, and pulmonary function from previous alcohol and tobacco 
use and poor nutritional status from the clinical manifestations of the cancer and/or previous 
radiation can further limit the use of EXTREME.   Second-line treatment regimens are limited 
and primarily palliative, resulting in very poor long- term survival rates for this patient 
population.  There remains a substantial unmet need for well -tolerated therapi[INVESTIGATOR_762242]- line setting 
for recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.  
PD-[ADDRESS_1044009] currently been investigated in several clinical trials in 
subjects with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN.  A Phase 1b study with anti–PD -1 in recurrent and 
metastatic SCCHN ( KEYNOTE -012) showed 18% (34 out of 192 subjects ) best ORR regardless 
of HPV status (25% HPV[+] and 14% HPV[-] ).  Duration of response was approximately 
12 months.  In a recent Phase 2 study  (KEYNOTE -055) evaluating anti –PD-1 antitumor activity 
after platinum and c etuximab failure in SCCHN showed 16% (95% CI, 11%-23% ) ORR 
(Bauml et al 2017).   The preliminary efficacy and safety results were consistent with 
KEYNOTE -012, and anti–PD -1 was well -tolerated among heavily pretreated recurrent or 
metastatic SCCHN subjects.  A preliminary analysis from Phase 3 (CHECKMATE -141) study to 
evaluate anti –PD-[ADDRESS_1044010] single -agent chemotherapy of the investigator’s choice 
(docetaxel, methotrexate, or  cetuximab) in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN subjects also 
demonstrated a significant OS benefit with anti–PD -1 treatment (with an increase from  16% to 
36% in 1- year OS) (Ferris et al 2016). 
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is being investigated in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in 
various tumor types.  In a Phase 1 study (n = 56), nivolumab in combination with PT- DC in 
chemotherapy -naive NSCLC showed ORR ranging from 33% to 50% and PFS ranging from 
4.8 to 6.1 months, and ≥ Grade 3 treatment -related AEs were observed in 45% of subjects 
(Rizvi et al 2016).  More promising efficacy signals have been observed in the KEYNOTE-021 
study of pembrolizumab in combination with PT-DC from open- label cohorts (n  = 74, ORR 
48%-71%, PFS ~10 months, ≥ Grade 3 treatment -related AEs 56% -71%; Gadgeel  et al 2016) 
and a randomized cohort of pembrolizumab/PT-DC versus PT- DC (n = 123, ORR 55% vs 29%, 
respectively,  PFS 13 vs 8.9 months, respectively , ≥ Grade 3 treatment -related AEs 39% vs 26%, 
respectively ; Langer et al 2016) as well as a Phase 1 study of atezolizumab (n = 58 safety 
evaluable, n = 41 efficacy evaluable, ORR 50%- 77%, PFS immature at time of analysis; 
Giaccone et al 2015).  Confirmatory Phase 3 clinical studies in advanced/metastatic NSCLC are 
ongoing for these [ADDRESS_1044011] inhibitor indoximod has been evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in

subjects with breast cancer from this study, a Phase 2 study of indoximod in combination with 
docetaxel or paclitaxel was initiated.  Preliminary safety data showed AEs were similar to those 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_658609],  and no unexpected AEs were observed ( Tang et al 2015).  
Indoximod in combination with gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel in subjects with metastatic 
pancreatic cancer was also well -tolerated in a Phase 1/2 study, and preliminary efficacy  results 
showed durable responses in 42% of subjects ( Bahary et al 2016).  
Overall, the data suggest that combining the IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat, a PD-[ADDRESS_1044013] s in the tumor 
microenvironment and ultimately improve the overall clinical benefit in patients  with advanced 
or metastatic solid tumors without overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_95611].

s From Nivolumab 
Potential safety concerns and recommended management guidelines regarding pulmonary 
toxicities, GI toxicities, hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathies, dermatologic toxicities, and other 
toxicities of concern are summarized in the nIB, and details regarding immune- related toxicities 
can be found in Section  5.7.3, Table 9, and Appendix C . 
1.3.3. Risks for the Combination of Epacadostat and Nivolumab  
The combination of epacadostat  and nivolumab has the potential to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_762243], 
more severe, and/or new immune- related toxicities as compared with each individually.  
1.3.4. Risks From 5 -Fluorouracil/Platinum ( Cisplatin or Carboplatin) 
The most common adverse reactions (occurring in greater than 30%) with 5- FU are diarrhea, 
nausea with occasional vomiting, mucositis, loss of appetite, photophobia, dysgeusia, phlebitis, 
and low blood cell counts.  Nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and is the DLT of cisplatin.  
Ototoxicity has been observed in up to 31% of patients  treated with a single dose of cisplatin.  
Myelosuppression occurs in 25% to 30% of pati ents treated with cisplatin, with leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia more pronounced at higher doses (> 50mg/m2).  Elderly patients may be more 
susceptible to myelosuppression.  When 5- FU is used in combination with cisplatin, 
hematological AEs were observed more often (> 40%) and mainly consisted of 
granulocytopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and infection.  Nausea and vomiting  rates were 
similar in frequency  (18% and 11%, respectively).  Stomatitis was also common (> 25%) in the 
patients taking the combination regimen.  Neurological toxicities were similar to single -agent 
regimens (<  5%; Gibson et al 2005). 
In a retrospective clinical study conducted to determine and to compare the efficacy of palliative 
chemotherapy with carboplatin plus 5- FU versus cisplatin plus 5- FU for subjects with recurrent 
and metastatic SCCHN, no Grade 3/[ADDRESS_1044014] ions were reported in subjects who received 
cisplatin in combination with 5-FU.  Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities were more common with 
the carboplatin plus 5- FU group (granulocytopenia [41.6%], anemia [37.5%], and 
thrombocytopenia [16.6%]).  Nausea, vomit ing, and diarrhea were the most frequent events 
reported.  Nonhematological toxicities were more pronounced in the cisplatin plus 5- FU group.  
The most common Grade 1/2 adverse reactions were nausea (94.1%) and vomiting (82.4%) in 
the cisplatin  plus 5-FU group.  Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy and ototoxicity were more likely 
to develop in subjects who used carboplatin plus 5- FU (16.7% and 12.5 %, respectively) 
compared with  those who used cisplatin plus 5-FU (11.8% and 0%, respectively ; Kua et al 
2013).

cases, fatal reactions may develop with either cisplatin or carboplatin and 5- FU combination 
regimens. 
1.3.5. Risks From Paclitaxel /Carboplatin 
Bone marrow suppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is dose-dependent 
and is also the DLT of carboplatin.  Anaphylactic reactions to carboplatin may occur within 
minutes of administration.  Carboplatin can induce emesis, which can be more severe in patient s 
who have previously received emetogenic therapy.  Although peripheral neurotoxicity is 
infrequent, its i ncidence is increased in patients older than 65 years and in patients previously 
treated with cisplatin.  
Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is dose-dependent and is the DLT of 
paclitaxel.  Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by [CONTACT_658641], angioedema, and generalized urticaria have occurred in 2% to 4% of subjects receiving paclitaxel in clinical trials.  Fatal reactions have occurred in subjects 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_250896]. 
1.3.6. Risks From Pacl itaxel/Cisplatin  
In a randomized Phase 3 study conducted to determine the response rate, survival, and toxicity of 
cisplatin and fluorouracil (CF) versus cisplatin and paclitaxel (CP) in subjects with advanced 
SCCHN, the most common Grade 3/[ADDRESS_1044016] ions were hematologic events , which were 
more common in the CF group than in the CP group (leukopenia, 63% vs 35%; 
granulocytopenia, 67% vs 55%; thrombocytopenia, 23% vs 4% , respectively).  Infection rate 
(≥ Grade 3) was 21% in the CF group versus 13% in the CP group.  Grade 3/4 anemia and 
thrombocytopenia occurred in 33% and 23% of subjects in the CF group, respectively,  versus in 
13% and 4% of subjects in the CP group, respectively.  Nausea and vomiting rates  were similar 
in frequency (19% and 18%, respectively, in the CF group; 18% and 10%, respectively, in the 
CP group).  Grade 3/4 stomatitis was more frequent in the group that received infusional 
fluorouracil (31% in the CF group; 0% in the CP group).  Neurotoxicity and metabolic events 
were equivalent  between groups.  The Kruskal -Wallis test for comparing the distribution of 
worst degree (≤ Grade 3) toxicities between 2 treatment groups indicated no significant 
difference between the groups treated with CF and CP ( Gibson et al  2005). 
1.3.7. Risks From  Pemetrexed/Carboplatin 
The most common event s (incidence ≥ 20% with single- agent use) with pemetrexed are fatigue, 
nausea, and anorexia.  When pemetrexed is used in combination with a platinum agent, common AEs include the following:  vomiting (40%), nausea (56%), neutropenia (29%), leukopenia 
(18%), anemia (33%), stomatitis/pharyngitis (14%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and constipation (21%).  Refer to the US prescribing information ( Alimta 2013) or the EU SmPC (Alimta 2016)

1.3.8. Risks From Pemetrexed/Cisplatin  
Use of pemetrexed and cisplatin in combination has been approved by [CONTACT_762290] -line therapy.  The most common AE s (incidence ≥ 20%) during 
pemetrexed monotherapy were fatigue, nausea,  and anorexia.  The most common AE s (incidence 
≥ 20%) when pemetrexed was administered  in combination with cisplatin include vomiting, 
neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, stomatitis/pharyngitis, thrombocytopenia, and constipation 
(Alimta 2013 ). 
1.3.9. Risks From Combining an IDO Inhibitor With Chemotherapy  
In a Phase I study of the IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod with docetaxel in advanced solid 
tumors, the most frequent AE s were fatigue (58.6%), anemia (51.7%), hyperglycemia, (48.3%), 
infection (44.8%), and nausea (41.4%; Soliman  et al 2014).  In a Phase [ADDRESS_1044017] common indoximod- related 
AEs of any grade occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects were fatigue (21%), nausea (20%), diarrhea 
(13%), and headache (12% ).  Twenty-eight percent  of subjects treated with indoximod and 
docetaxel  experienced at least 1 Grade 3 or 4 AE .  The safety profile of indoximod with 
docetaxel was compatible with the safety profile of taxane monotherapy ( Tang et al 2015). 
Recently presented safety data from a Phase 1/2 study evaluating the combination of in doximod 
with gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer showed that the 
most frequently reported any grade AEs  (regardless of attribution) occurring in ≥ 10% of 
subjects were fatigue (40%); weight loss, diarrhea, peripheral edema, and asthenia (20% each); 
and anemia, decreased appetite, nausea, myalgia, rash, decreased neutrophil count, and decreased 
platelet count (13.3% each; Bahary  et al 2016).  
1.3.10. Risks From Combining a PD -1 Inhibitor With Chemotherapy  
In an investigator- initiated Phase 1 study of subjects with metastatic CRC, common AEs when 
pembrolizumab was combined with mFOLFOX6 were neutropenia (40%) and hyponatremia 
(30%; Stenehjem  et al 2016 ).  The most common AE in 11 subjects with metastatic pancreatic 
cancer treated with gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel plus nivolumab was anemia (33%; 
George et al 2016). 
Recently updated  safety data from a randomized cohort of the KEYNOTE-021 study where 
subjects with nonsquamous NSCLC were treated with carboplatin/pemetrexed with 
pembrolizumab showed the most common ≥ Grade 3 treatment- related AEs were anemia (12%),  
decreased neutrophil count (7%),  and fatigue (3%;  Papadimitrakopoulou et al 2017).  Overall, 
treatment -related AEs ≥ Grade 3 occurred in 39% subjects  treated with the PD -1/chemotherapy 
combination versus 29% with chemotherapy alone. 
1.4. Justification for Treatment Regimen s 
The goal of the present study is to explore doses of the IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat  that may 
synergize or otherwise augment the efficacy observed with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in subjects with advanced cancer.  In Phase 1 of the study for combination immunotherapy (epacadostat + nivolumab), the established regimen of nivolumab (3 mg /kg every 2 weeks ) will 
be combined with doses of epacadostat  that provide partial and more complete IDO1 inhibition 
based on observations from the Phase 1 study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101.  The starting dose selected for

epacadostat  in combination with nivolumab is 25 mg BID with escalation up to 300 mg BID.  
This is based on the preliminary observation that the average kynurenine inhibition for 
epacadostat 25 mg BID and 100 mg BID is 66% and 89%, respectively, and on the safety of 
these doses, as well as doses  up to 700 mg BID in the Phase 1 study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-201 as 
monotherapy and in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic ( PD) observations from Studies  INCB [ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_1044018].  Based on 
a 6-hour observation period at steady state on Day 15 after administration of epacadostat , 
kynurenine levels are incompletel y inhibited  (66%) compared with baseline levels in subjects 
treated with 25 mg BID but are nearly  maximally inhibited (89%) in subjects treated with 
100 mg BID . 
Doses of epacadostat  ≥ 300 mg BID are associated with > 94% average inhibition of kynurenine, 
and based on this small difference in the average kynurenine inhibition, a final escalation of 
epacadostat  to 300 mg BID may be evaluated.  Target coverage at 25 mg BID is consistent with 
the level needed to achieve maximal efficacy as well as to demonstrate synergy with an  
anti–PD-[ADDRESS_1044019] been well -tolerated in the subjects 
who had significant comorbidities.  Initial evaluation of epacadostat  300 mg BID in combination 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (3 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks, up to 4 doses ) in this study  was terminated because 
of the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevations in 5 of 7 subjects treated at this dose.  
These AEs were reversible in all subjects upon discontinuation of study therapy and institution of 
corticosteroids based on an established protocol for the management of immune toxicities related to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224].  However, subsequent cohorts with lower doses of epacadostat in 
combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (25  mg BID, 50 mg BID, and 50 mg once every morning/25 mg 
once every evening) were well -tolerated ( Gibney et al 2015).  In addition, early safety analysis of 
epacadostat in combination with another PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab) achieved dose 
combinations of 300 mg BID ( Gangadhar  et al 2015 ).  It is expected that achieving similar dose 
combinations with nivolumab will result in a clinically active combination regimen.  Complete 
inhibition of the IDO1 target is not required for maximally effective activity in preclinical 
models, and a s monotherapy, maximally effective doses in preclinical  models result in exposures 
that are comparable to doses of 50 to 300 mg BID in humans. 
Population PK (PPK) analyses using data from various tumor types including NSCLC, MEL, RCC, classical HL, and UC have shown that the PK of nivolumab is linear with proportional 
exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg; no differences in PK across ethnicities and solid tumor types were observed.  To provide additional flexibility and convenience when combining 
with other anticancer agents, such as chemotherapy, the PPK model was used to simulate dosing 
regimens with less frequent administration ( Q3W and Q4W ).  These regimens were selected 
such that they would provide similar exposures to those following administration of the approved 
q2w dosing regimens. 
Using the PPK model, the exposures following the administration of nivolumab 360 mg Q3W  
and 480 mg Q4W  were simulated.  Based on this analys is, it is predicted that steady state 
average concentrations (C
ave) of nivolumab 240 mg q2w or nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2w are similar 
following the administration in subjects who have an approximate median weight of 80 kg.  The 
steady state peak concentrations (Cmax,ss) following the administration of nivolumab 360 mg

Q3W and 480 mg Q4W  are predicted to be approximately 26% and 40% higher than following 
the administration of nivolumab 3 mg/kg, respectively.  However, C max,ss of nivolumab 360 mg 
Q3W and 480 Q4W  is predicted to be less than those following the administration of nivolumab 
10 mg/kg q2w, and this provides sufficient safety margins for these dosing regimens 
(Zhao et al 2017). 
Both nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and 480 mg Q4W  dosing regim ens are currently being 
investigated in multiple tumor types, such as NSCLC and MEL, as monotherapy and in combination with other agents, including the combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy 
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies (ie, Studies [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
In Part [ADDRESS_1044020] been 
supported by [CONTACT_395494], efficacy, and exposure- response analyses results  (Zhao et al 2017), these 
dosing regimens and schedules of nivolumab will be used in Phase 2 for the dose expansion of 
combination immu notherapy cohorts.  
Nivolumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over a 
long treatment duration.  In Study CA209010 (a Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, 
dose-ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with advanced/metastatic clear cell RCC), a dose 
association was observed for infusion site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions (1.7% at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg, and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg).  All of the events were either Grade 1 or 
Grade 2 and were manageable.  An infusion duration of 30 minutes for a 240 mg dose, 360 mg 
dose, and 480 mg dose (30% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any 
safety concerns compared to the prior experience with 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 
60-minute duration.  For P hase 2 of the study, nivolumab infusion time will be 30 minutes.  For 
those experiencing an infusion reaction, infusion time may be increased to 60 minutes.  
In the present study, epacadostat has been studied in subjects  at both 100 mg BID and 300 mg 
BID with nivolumab 240 mg IV Q2W.  In Part 1 of Phase 1, 13 subjects were treated at 300 mg 
BID, and no DLTs were observed  during a 42-day observation period, and an MTD was not 
defined.  As of 13 FEB 2017, 174 subjects were treated at 300 mg BID (13 subjects in Part  1 of 
Phase 1; 161 subjects in Phase 2).  The most common treatment- related AEs  (≥ 10%) were  rash, 
fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, pruritus, AST increased, and decreased appetite.  The pooled safety 
data from Part 1 of Phase 1 and Phase 2 demonstrated that there were fewer dose reductions 
(4% [n = 3] in 100 mg BID and 5% [n = 8] in 300 mg BID) and study treatment discontinuations 
(6% [n = 4] in 100 mg BID and 12% [n = 20] in 300 mg B ID) in subjects treated with 
epacadostat 100 mg BID compared to 300 mg BID in combination with nivolumab ( Perez et al 
2017).  There were no treatment -related deaths.  The overall frequency of all -grade 
treatment -related AEs in subjects treated with epacadostat 100 mg BID or 300 mg BID in 
combination with nivolumab was 83% and 73%, respectively.  Treatment -related Grade 3 or 4 
AEs were 25% in 100 mg BID and 27% in 300 mg BID.  The frequency of dose interruptions 
due to any grade treatment- related AEs were 26% (n = 18) in 100 mg BID and 30% (n = 48) in 
300 mg BID. 
Based on the published safety and PK profiles for both epacadostat and nivolumab, the starting 
dose of epacadostat will be 100 mg BID in combination with nivolumab 360 mg Q3W  and 
chemotherapy regimen in Part 2 of Phase 1.  F or I/O-relapsed and I/O-refractory MEL cohorts in

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1044021] that 2 years of PD -1 checkpoint inhibitor treat ment may be suf ficient 
for long-term benefit.   CA209003, a dose-escalation cohort expansion study evaluating the safety 
and clinical activity of nivolumab in subjects with previously treated advanced solid tumors (including 129 subjects with NSCLC), specified a maximum treatment duration of 2 years.  Among 16 subjects with NSCLC who discontinued nivolumab after completing 2 years of 
treatment, 12 subjects were alive  after > 5 years and remained progression- free without any 
subsequent therapy.  In the CA209003 NSCLC cohort, the OS curve begins to plateau after 
2 years, with an OS rate of 25% at 2 years and 18% at 3 years ( Brahmer et al 2017).   These 
survival outcomes are similar to Phase 3 studies in previously treated NSCLC, in which 
nivolumab treatment was continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity (2- year OS rates 
of 23% and 29%, and 3- year OS rates of 16% -18% for squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC, 
respectively; Felip et al 2017 ).  Similar results have been reported in clinical studies of 
pembrolizumab, another PD-1 inhibitor.  Keynote-010 was a randomized P hase 3 study of 
pembrolizumab (at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks) versus docetaxel in subjects with 
previously treated, PD- L1–positive, advanced NSCLC that  specified a maximum treatment 
duration of 2 years for pembrolizumab.  Overall survival was significantly longer with both 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (HR 0.72, p = 0.[ZIP_CODE]) and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg (HR 0.60, 
p < 0.[ZIP_CODE]) compared with docetaxel, with an OS plateau developi[INVESTIGATOR_448161] [ADDRESS_1044022] were able to maintain their response, 
including those with stable disease, with only 2 patients (4%) having confirmed progressi on after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_25577] 2 years ( Herbst et al 2016 ).  Keynote-006 was a randomized Phase 3 study of 
pembrolizumab versus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_686844], w hich also specified a 
maximum 2 -year duration of pembrolizumab treatment.  One hundred four (19%) of 556 patients 
randomized to pembrolizumab completed 2 years of treatment.  With a median follow -up of 
9 months after completion of pembrolizumab, the estimated risk of progression or death was 9% in these patients ( Robert et al 2017).  
Taken together, these data suggest that treatment beyond 2 years is unlikely to confer additional 
clinically mea ningful benefit and that the risk of progression after discontinuing treatment at 
2 years is low.

4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 1/[ADDRESS_1044046] of 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2).  Part [ADDRESS_1044047] dose- escalation 
design to determine the MTD or PAD of epacadostat when co administered with nivolumab 
(defined as combination immunotherapy ) in subjects with select advanced solid tumors and 
lymphomas, including MEL, NSCLC, CRC, SCCHN, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, and B-cell 
NHL or HL.  The study design  for Part 1 of Phase 1  is shown in Figure  1. 
Part 2 of Phase 1 will evaluate the preliminary safety of  epacadostat in combination with 
nivolumab and several chemotherapy regimens (defined as combination chemo-immunotherapy) 
in subjects with SCCHN and NSCLC by [CONTACT_2329] a dose de- escalation design.   The starting dose of 
epacadostat  in Part 2 will be the RP2D of ep acadostat selected for the use of combination 
immunotherapy in Part 1 .  Initial dose -finding cohorts in Part 2 will be expanded to safety 
expansion cohorts and will further evaluate tolerated dose(s) of epacadostat when given in 
combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy regimens (see Figure 2 for study design of 
Phase 1 Part 2 ). 
Phase 2 of the study will include 9 expansion cohorts in tumors types tested in Phase 1 Part 1 
(except DLBCL will be the only lymphoma permitted ) with a) historically high activity under 
nivolumab monotherapy and b) with historically low activity with nivolumab monotherapy.  In 
Phase 2 of the study, nivolumab will be administered at 240 mg IV every 2 weeks or 480 mg IV every 4 weeks for specific tumor types as described in Figure  1.  (Note:  In Phase 2, subjects 
enrolled into I/O-relapsed and I/O-refractory MEL cohorts will be administered  epacadostat  
100 mg BID .)

a Approximately 3 to 9 subjects will be enrolled during dose escalation.  Additional subjects may be added to any dose level af ter 
determining the preliminary safety at that dose level for a min imum of 6 and maximum of 9 evaluable subjects per dose level. 
Dose level numbers marked "a" and "b" may occur in parallel.  Oral administration of epacadostat BID will occur on a daily 
basis unless indicated by [CONTACT_762273] 1 week followed by [CONTACT_762294].  Nivolumab administration will be 3 mg/kg IV every [ADDRESS_1044050] for 6 weeks  (42 days) .  Three subjects will be treated 
initially at each dose level.  If 0 DLTs occur in a cohort of 3 subjects, a new cohort of 3 subjects 
will be treated at the next higher dose level.  If 1 of 3 subjects experience a DLT, that cohort will 
be expanded to 6 subjects.  If 1 of 6 subjects experiences a DLT, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be treated at the next higher dose level.  If 2 o f 6 DLT subjects experience a DLT, that cohort 
will be expanded to 9 subjects.  If ≥ 2/3, 3/6, or 3/[ADDRESS_1044051] exceeded the MTD .

combination with nivolumab.  If 1 of 6 or < 3 of 9 subjects experience DLTs , the remaining  
Phase 2 cohorts may be opened with 300 mg BID as the RP2D after reviewing the emerging data 
from Phase 2 cohorts te sting 100 mg BID. 
If 300 mg BID is tested and not tolerated , an intermediate dose of 200 mg BID may be tested  on 
either a continuous schedule or every-other- week schedule  or 100 mg BID may be selected as 
the RP2D.  The RP2D decision for the remaining Phase 2 cohorts will be made based on the available data from ongoing Phase 2 cohorts administered  100 mg BID.   If an MTD is not 
determined based on the data from Phase 1 and ongoing Phase 2 cohorts, then the remaining 
Phase 2 cohorts may be opened at a PAD of epacadostat (eg, 100 mg BID). 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Phase 2 Dose Selection for Combination I mmunotherapy  (Phase 1 Part 1)  
If 100 mg BID of epacadostat is determined as safe and tolerable in Phase 1 Part 1, Phase 2  of 
the study may begin to enroll in the I/O -naive MEL and NSCLC cohorts in parallel with  the  
evaluation of epacadostat at 300 mg BID in Part 1 .  If 300 mg BID is then selected as the Phase 2 
dose (RP2D), and if  either I/O -naive MEL or NSCLC cohort enrolls < 50% of the total cohort 
(≤ 25 subjects) at 100 mg BID  up to the RP2D decision, then any additional subjects  in that 
specific cohort  being enrolled will be treated with epacadostat 300 mg BID at the sponsor' s 
discretion, in lie u of opening new cohorts of I/O-naive MEL and NSCLC with 300 mg BID.  The 
same rule will apply to any additional Phase 2 tumor cohorts (ie, CRC, ovarian cancer, etc) that 
may be opened with epacadostat 100 mg BID before RP2D selection .  (Note: Additional 
I/O-relapsed and I/O-refractory MEL cohorts will  be opened at 100 mg BID.) 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Combination Chemo-Immunotherapy Cohorts (Part 2  of Phase 1) 
The starting dose of epacadostat when given in combination with nivolumab (360 mg IV every 3 weeks, Q3W) and chemotherapy will be  [ADDRESS_1044054] of 3 tumor cohorts (1 SCCHN 
cohort and 2 NSCLC cohorts) that will enroll in parallel.   A minimum of 6 evaluable subjects 
will be enrolled in each tumor cohort epacadostat at 100 mg BID and each cohort will be observed for 42 days for DLTs.  
In a tumor cohort the following rules will be applied to determine dose or dose de- escalation:  
•If ≤ 1 of 6 evaluable subjects has a DLT, then 100 mg BID will be used in a safety
expansion cohort (Cohort A, B, C) for that specific tumor type.
•If [ADDRESS_1044055] a DLT, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled in the
same cohort (Cohort 1, 2, 3).   If there are no additional DLTs (≤ 2 DLTs occurred in a
total of 9 evaluable subjects), then a safety expansion cohort (Cohort A or B or C)
will start to enroll in that specific dose level.

least 2 out of the 3 scheduled nivolumab doses of 3  mg/kg through the 6- week 
(42-day) DLT observation period (only if the 1 missed dose was secondary to 
nonmedical reasons) and must have received at least 75% of the cohort- specified dose 
of epacadostat during the DLT observation period. 
• In Part 2, in combination chemo -immunotherapy cohorts, subjects  must have received 
[ADDRESS_1044058] 
75% of the cohort-specified dose of epacadostat during the 42- day DLT observation 
period. 
• In addition, subjects with dose delays during the 42-day DLT observation period of 
> 1 week for non-DLT events will be considered not evaluable for making decisions 
on dose escalation or dose de- escalation and should be replaced. 
Dose escalation  in Part 1 or dose de- escalation in Part 2 of epacadostat  will be based on the 
number of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) experienced during the DLT observation period.  Dose modifications should not be made during the DLT observation period without discussion with 
the medical monitor.  
4.1.2. Phase 2 Combination Immunotherapy Cohort Expansions  
The purpose of the cohort expansions in Phase 2 is to gather additional safety, tolerability, 
preliminary efficacy , information regarding the combination of 
epacadostat  and nivolumab.  Once the safety profile of active doses is  characterized and the 
RP2D has been defined, the cohort expansions will be initiated at the RP2D.  However , the 
I/O-naive MEL and NSCLC cohorts may be opened using epacadostat  100 mg BID in parallel to 
testing 300 mg BID if the 100 mg BID dose of epacadostat  is deemed tolerable in Phase 1 Part 1.  
Treatment doses in the cohort expansion groups will not exceed the MTD.  Nine expansion 
cohorts in Phase 2  will be restricted to the same tumor types tested in Phase 1  Part 1 (except 
DLBCL will b e the only lymphoma permitted in Phase 2), and Phase 2 will also include a cohort 
for glioblastoma .  The NSCLC and I/O- naive MEL cohorts, which have demonstrated activity 
with nivolumab monotherapy and are in Phase 3 evaluation in these indications, will be used to assess increased activity of the combination.  In Phase 2, t here will be 2 additional MEL cohorts 
to explore the activity of combination immunotherapy; one cohort will enroll subjects who 
relapsed on or after anti –PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (I/O relapsed) and the other cohort will enroll 
subjects who were ref ractory to prior anti–PD -1/PD-L1 therapy (I/O refractory) (for  I/O relapsed 
MEL cohort and I/O refractory MEL cohort definitions , see Section  3.2).  Subjects who are 
enrolled in these 2 new MEL co horts will be administered  nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks,

whereas subjects who are enrolled in I/O- naive MEL, NSCLC, CRC, SCCHN, ovarian cancer, 
DLBCL and glioblastoma c ohorts will be administered  nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks.  
Subjects enrolled in I/O MEL cohorts will be administered epacadostat 100 mg BID; however, if 
there is no or minim al activity in tumor responses in these cohort s, alternative doses of 
epacadostat may be explored at the sponsor discretion.  The CRC, SCCHN, ovarian cancer, 
DLBCL, and glioblastoma cohorts will explore activity of the combination  in tumors with 
preliminary, unknown, or historically low responses to nivolumab monotherapy.  Continuous 
evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansions will be performed throughout enrollment 
in the expansion cohorts.  If the cumulative incidence of Grade 3 or Grade 4 study treatment–
related AEs exceeds 40% after enrolling the first 6  subjects in any of these cohorts, the findings 
will be reviewed  and further enrollment will be interrupted until the sponsor(s), investigators, 
and regulatory authorities, if applicable, ha ve determined the appropriate course of action.  If an 
expansion cohort is discontinued due to toxicity, a new cohort may be initiated at a previously tested lower dose level  of epacadostat . 
In each of the NSCLC and I/O-naive MEL cohorts, approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled to 
allow for a more precise estimate of the ORR in these tumors where activity for nivolumab as 
monotherapy has been established.  The sample size for the I/O-relapsed MEL, I/O- refractory 
MEL, CRC, ovarian, SCCHN, and DLBCL cohorts will be approximately 25 subjects  each.  The 
sample size for the glioblastoma  cohort will be approximately 28  (Table 4).  The study schedules 
for Phase 2 are  shown in Table 18, Table 19, and Table 20.

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1044077] 42 days of treatment will b e 
used to define tolerability.  
Modifications to epacadostat dose regimens are planned for Phase 1 Part 2  combination 
chemo-immunotherapy cohorts.  Independent of the determination of tolerability during Phase 1 
Part 1 or Part 2 , subjects may require individual modification of epacadostat  or nivolumab in 
Part 1 or modifications of epacadostat, nivolumab, or chemotherapy regimen  if necessitated by 
[CONTACT_9934]-related or unrelated  AEs, including irAEs or DLTs .  Dose modifications  are summarized in 
Section 5.7.1. 
5.6.1. Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicities  
A DLT will be defined as the occurrence of any treatmen t-emergent AE in Table 6 occurring up 
to and including s tudy Day 42 (6-week observation period) in Phase 1 Part s 1 and 2.  
Dose-limiting toxicities include all treatment -emergent AEs of the specified grades, regardless of 
investigator attribution or relatedness. 
Only toxicities with a clear alternative explanation (eg, due to disease progression) ; transient  
(≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or 
symptoms based on investigator determination ; or irAEs of Grade 3 or higher that improve to 
Grade 1 or lower by [CONTACT_762298] 14 days after the initiation 
of supportive care can be deemed a non-DLT. 
For the purpose of making decisions on dose escalation from a safety perspective during the DLT observation period, subjects will be considered evaluable for dose tolerability if they meet 
1 of the following criteria: 
• In Phase [ADDRESS_1044078] 2 out of the 3 scheduled 
nivolumab doses (only if the 1 missed dose was secondary to nonmedical reasons) and must have received at least 75% of the cohort- specified dose of epacadostat 
through the 6-week (42-day) DLT observation period. 
• In Phase [ADDRESS_1044079] 2 doses of the scheduled 
nivolumab doses, 75% of planned doses of chemotherapy regimen (only if the 
1 missed dose was secondary to nonmedical reasons) , and at least 75% of the 
cohort-specified dose of epacadostat in C1D1 during the DLT observation period. 
In addition, subjects with dose delays of > 1 week for non- DLT events during the DLT 
observation period will be considered not evaluable for making decisions on dose- escalation  
cohorts or dose de- escalation  cohorts and should be replaced. 
Dose escalation ( combination immunotherapy) or de- escalation ( combination 
chemo-immunotherapy) of epacadostat will be based on the number of DLTs experienced during 
the DLT observation period.  Dose mo difications should not be made during the DLT 
observation period without discussion with the medical monitor.

Toxicity 
Hematologic Toxicities:  
•Any Grade 4 (life-threatening) thrombocytopenia or neutropenia lasting > 7 days .
•Febrile neutropenia  ≥ Grade 3 for 72 hours .
•≥ Grade 3 hemolysis .

longer. 
− An event clearly associated with the underlying disease, disease progression, a concomitant medication, or 
comorbidity.  
− Asymptomatic changes in lipid profiles . 
− Singular or nonfasting elevations in blood glucose (ie, blood glucose excursions will be considered toxicities if fasting blood glucose is elevated on 2 separate occasions).  
− irAEs of Grade 3 or higher that improve to ≤ Grade 1 in ≤ 14 days by [CONTACT_762300]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Procedures for Cohort Review and Dose Escalation  
Telephone conferences will be s cheduled by [CONTACT_165908] 1 investigators in order to 
review cohort -specific data, overall safety data from prior cohorts (if applicable), and to agree on 
dose escalation.  For additional safety oversight, this group will review and adjudicate individual 
high-grade AEs as potentially dose limiting and for guiding the study team on decisions 
regarding dose escalation and cohort expansion.  The same method will be used for reviewing 
data at the end of the dose-escalation portion of the study to determine the recommended dose 
for the dose-expansion portion of the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow-Up for Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Subjects whose treatment is discontinued because of  a DLT must be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the DLT event, whichever comes first.

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1044082] dose escalations are not permitted.   Subjects will remain on their cohort- assigned 
dose, or a lower dose of epacadostat  if required because of AEs, throughout the treatment and 
extension phases.  Table 7 describes epacadostat  dose reductions that may occur due to any 
related AEs.  
There will be no dose reductions of nivolumab allowed for the management of toxicities of 
individual subjects.  Doses  of nivolumab may be delayed for toxicity management .  
In combination chemo-immunotherapy cohorts, i f cisplatin is selected as  a part of a specific 
chemotherapy regimen, then the cisplatin starting dose will be  100 mg/m2 at C1D1.  However, if 
a subject develops ≥ Grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting that prevents  administration of the daily 
epacadostat doses for more than 3 days within that cycle, then the cisplatin dose may be 
de-escalated to 75  mg/mg2 starting on C2D1, with the medical monitor 's approval.  Once the 
cisplatin dose is reduced to 75 mg/m2, it should remain reduced at subsequent doses and cycles.

5.7.4. Procedures for Subjects Exhibiting Serotonin Syndrome  
As noted in Section  1.3, there is a chance that epacadostat  could cause an increase in serotonin 
levels in the brain that might trigger SS ( Boyer and Shannon 2005) when administered in 
combination with other serotonergic agents.  This syndrome has been most closely associated 
with use of MAOIs, meperidine/pethidine , linezolid, or methylene blue; all of these agents are 
prohibited during the study.  Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs are permitted in the study.  
Serotonin syndrome usually manifests with autonomic changes, mental status changes, and 
neurological findings.  These mild, moderate, and severe signs and sympto ms of SS (summarized 
in Table 16) should be evaluated in the context of possible comorbid conditions as well.  
The following procedures will be implemented if subjects exhibit the signs/symptoms of SS 
described in  Table 16, including tremor , hyperreflexia, spontaneous, ocular, or inducible clonus, 
together with agitation, fever, diaphoresis, or muscle rigidity:  
•Immediately interrupt study treatment administration.
•Immediately interrupt any SSRI or SNRI administration .
•Provide appropriate medical management of the subject until all signs/symptoms are
resolved (eg, IV fluids and/or sympathomimetic amines for hypotension,benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_165836], administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists
such as cyproheptadine).
•If etiologies other than serotonin syndrome are excluded, nivoluma b administration
may be resumed unless other AE management guidelines apply for the specific event.
•If subject chooses to re main in the study, restart treatment  with epacadostat  after the
SSRI or SNRI has been discontinued, no sooner than [ADDRESS_1044103] elapsed for the
specific SSRI or SNRI in question and after resolution of signs/symptoms of SS.  TheSSRI or SNRI treatment  MAY NOT be restarted.
•If subject chooses to withdraw from the study, or must restart treatment with SSRI or
SNRI, the subject should be scheduled for a follow-up visit.  Treatment with SSRI or
SNRI may be initiated 2 weeks after resolution of signs and symptoms of SS.
•If a subject has  experienced moderate or severe unconfounded SS in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_277392], without concomitant SSRI or SNRI usage, or serotonergic
concomitant medications, only nivolumab administration may b e resumed;
epacadostat treatment should be permanently discontinued.

5.8. Criteria for Permanent  Discontinuation of  Study Drug(s) 
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be withdrawn  from the study at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subjec t may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_165910], the 
study plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.  Specific details 
regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Se ction 7.7.7, Withdrawal  or 
Discontinuation. 
Subjects must be withdrawn from the study treatment  for the following reasons: 
• In the investigator' s medical judgment, further participation would be injurious to the 
subject's health or well -being. 
• The subject becomes pregnant. 
• Consent is withdrawn by [CONTACT_29254] (such as parent or legal 
guardian). 
• The study is t erminated  by [CONTACT_456]. 
• The study is t erminated  by [CONTACT_165912]/IEC.

•The subject has experienced an unacceptable toxicity or a toxici ty that does not
recover in 6 weeks.  Investigators who wish to continue treatment after a treatment
delay of 4 weeks should consult with the sponsor's medical monitor for approval.
•Noncompliance with study treatment or procedure requirements.
•The subject is lost to follow -up.
•The subject has received study treatment for 2 years (ie, [ADDRESS_1044104] elapsed since
Cycle 1 Day 1).
A subject  may be discontinued from study  treatment as follows : 
•If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility
criteria, then the medical monitor, in collaboration with the investigator, will
determine whether the subject should be withdrawn from the study.
•If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures or study drug administration in the
investigator 's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], then the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on
handling the subject.
The EOT and follow-up visit procedures are listed in Section  6 (Table 20 and Table 24).  After 
the EOT, each subject will be followed for [ADDRESS_1044105] dose of combination treatment for AE and SAE monitoring as described in Section  8.3.2. 
5.9. Study Completion  
5.9.1. Study Completion Criteria  
Subjects will be considered completing the study if they met any of the following criteria: 
•Subject dies and a date of death is available.
•Subject is known to have died; however, the date of death cannot be obtained.(NOTE:  every effort must be made to obtain the date of death.)
•Subject completes the 100 -day safety follow-up period.
•Consent is withdrawn  for any further contact [CONTACT_165913].
− Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty of
jeopardizing their health care or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise 
entitled.  Every reasonable effort s hould be made to determine the reason a 
subject withdraws prematurely, and this information should be recorded in the 
eCRF.

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1044106] is withdrawn from the study:  
•The study monitor or sponsor must be notified.
•The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the subject' s medical record and
in the eCRF.
•The EOT or early termination visit should be performed.
•Subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up visit or until
study drug–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible,
whichever is longer.
5.10. Beginning and End of the Study 
The study begins when the first subject signs the informed consent.  The end of the study may be 
designated as the timepoint when all subjects have discontinued the study or are a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_1044107](s) may enter additional 
treatment cycles.  At this point a database lock of the study may occur to allow the analysis of 
the study data.  Any remaining subjects may continue to r eceive study medication per Protocol.  
The subject is considered on study until such time that he/she meets any of the study completion  
criteria and written notification is given to the sponsor. 
5.11. Concomitant Medications and Measures  
Medications or vaccinati ons specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing study.  If there is a clinical indication for 1 of these or other medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohibited during the study , discontinuation from study ther apy or 
vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the sponsor.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject' s primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the 
subject on study therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, the sponsor, and the subject. 
5.11.1. Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject's welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the eCRF, including all 
prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If changes 
occur during the study period, documentation of drug regimen , frequency, route, and date may 
also be included on the eCRF .

Section 8. 
5.11.2. Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_12707] , including, but not limited to , the items outlined below: 
• Nausea/vomiting:  Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and 
consideration should be given in subsequent cycles to the administration of 
prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard institutional practice.  Subjects 
should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake. 
• Anti-infectives :  Subjects with a documented infectious complication should receive 
oral or IV antibiotics or other anti- infective agents as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_110526] a given infectious condition, according to standard institutional practice.  
• Immune-related AEs:  See Section  5.7.3 regarding diagnosis and management of 
adverse experiences of a potential immunologic etiology.  
• Management of infusion reactions  from nivolumab ( Section 5.11.3). 
5.11.3. Management of I nfusion Reactions From Nivolumab 
Since nivolumab contains only human Ig protein sequences, it is unlikely to be immunogenic and 
induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions (current rate of reported infusion reactions  for 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg is 6% [3/54] for any Grade, and [ADDRESS_1044109] been 
reported).  However, if such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, 
headache, r ash, pruritus, arthralgias, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  
All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported within 24 hours to the medical monitor 
and reported as an SAE if criteria are met.  Infusion reactions should be graded according to 
National Cancer Institute ( NCI) CTCAE  (version 4.0) guidelines.  In Phase 2, for those 
experiencing an infusion reaction, infusion time may  be increased to 60 minutes. 
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines as appropriate: 
For Grade 1 symptoms :  (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated)  
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms.  The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions :  diphenhydramine 50 mg (or 
equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg ( or acetaminophen) at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab administrations. 
For Grade 2 symptoms :  (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory 
drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated 
for ≥ 24 hours)

diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg ( or 
acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms.  Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate.  If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of 
the original infusion rate.  Monitor subject closely.  If symptoms recur, then no further nivolumab will be administered at that visit.  Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_1044111] be recorded on the eCRF.  The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions :  diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 
325 to 1000 m g (or acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional 
nivolumab administrations.  If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose :  up to 25 mg of IV 
hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used. 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms :  (Severe reaction, Grade 3 :  prolonged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_20309]/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138] 
[eg, renal impai rment, pulmonary infiltrates].  Grade 4:  life threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated).  
Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab.  Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat 
the subject as follows :  Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected 
slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 
100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed.  Subject  should be monitored until the investigator is 
comfortable that the symptoms will not recur.  Nivolumab will be permanently discontinued.  
Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis.   
Remain at bedside and m onitor subject until recovery from symptoms.  In the case of 
late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or generalized pruritus 
within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids). 
In order to avoid the occurrence of severe hypersensitivity reactions, all patients treated with 
paclitaxel should be premedicated with corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone), 
diphenhydramine, and H
2 antagonists (such as cimetidine or ranitidine)  using applicable 
institutional guidelines .  Minor symptoms such as flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, hypotension, 
or tachycardia do not require interruption of therapy.   However, severe reactions, such as 
hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema, or generalized 
urticaria require immediate  discontinuation of paclitaxel  and aggressive symptomatic therapy.   
Subjects who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with 
paclitaxel .

5.12. Restricted Medications and Measures 
•Systemic steroids may be used at doses < 10 mg/day , and prednisone or equivalents
with medical monitor approval.
•Use of coumarin-based anticoagulants (eg, warfarin ) is discouraged.  Low-dose
warfarin (1 mg) is acceptable; however, doses that increase the INR are discouraged
and will require dose modification.  If an alternative to coumarin -based
anticoagulants cannot be used, dose modifications of the warfarin  may be
needed.  Based on the observed magnitude of epacadostat/warfarin PK interaction and
PK/pharmacodynamic modeling results, for an epacadostat dose of [ADDRESS_1044112] after initiation of
epacadostat administration based on approximately 30% to 40% reduction in S- and
R-warfarin oral clearance values.   Close INR monitoring is recommended for subjects
on a stable dose of warfarin who are starting treatment with epacadostat.   Based on
PK/pharmacodynamic modeling, recommendations for warfarin dose modifications
for subjects receiving other epacadostat doses, are summarized in  Table 17 based on
the INR before starting epacadostat.
Table 17: Warfarin Dose Adjustment Recommendation When Initiating Concurrent Epacadostat Treatment 
Stable Baseline INR  Epacadostat   Dose 
≤ 100 mg BID  200 mg BID  300 mg BID  
INR ≤ 2.5 Close INR monitoring  Close INR monitoring  Reduce warfarin by ~33% 
and monitor INR  
INR > 2.5 Close INR monitoring  Reduce warfarin by 
20%-25% and monitor INR  Reduce warfarin by ~33% 
and monitor INR  
•Use of the anticonvulsant carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (a UGT1A9 inducer) is discouraged.
Because there is a potential  interaction that could result in lower epacadostat
exposures, an alternative to carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_658619], if possible.
5.13. Prohibited Medications and Measures  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the foll owing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_165838] s creening and treatment 
period of this study unless otherwise noted below: 
•Any investigational medication o ther than the study drugs.
•Any anticancer medications , including chemotherapy or biologic therapy other than
the study medications.
•Any immunological- based treatment for any reason.
− Note:  Inhaled or topi[INVESTIGATOR_14271], and systemic steroids at doses
< 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalents are allowed with medical monitor 
approval, as described in Section 5.12, and immune suppressants are allowed for 
treatment for immune toxicities .

7.1. Study Procedures
Section 6 summarizes the study procedures to be performed at each visit.  Individual study 
procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform these procedures at 
unscheduled timepoints if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093]. 
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_23638]/or 
BMS for reasons related to subject safety.  In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (eg , hepatitis C), and thus local regulations may require that 
additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
7.2. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained from the study subject before conducting any 
study-specific procedures.   The granting of informed consent for study participation must be 
documented in writing, using an ICF that contains all the elements required by [CONTACT_12212] E6 and 
describes the nature, scope, and pos sible consequences of the study  in a form understandable to 
the study subject.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and administration must be 
followed; a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pr egnancy in order to 
participate in the study  (Appendix A ). 
7.3. Demography and History 
7.3.1. Demographics and Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening 
by [CONTACT_165922], race, ethnicity (where 
allowed by [CONTACT_427]) , medical and surgical history, and concurrent illnesses assessed 
using the NCI CTCAE  v4.0 (NCI 2010).  Medical history should include all active conditions 
and any condition considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_093].  Details regarding the disease fo r which the subject has enrolled in this study (eg, date of diagnosis, primary tumor 
histology, prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], surgeries, radiation therapy, and stage of cancer) will be recorded separately and not listed in medical history. 
7.3.2. Prior Medications  
Prior and ongoing medications will be reviewed to determine study eligibility.  The investigator 
or qualified designee will review prior medication use, including any Protocol-specified washout 
requirement, and record prior medication taken by [CONTACT_2690] [ADDRESS_1044135] has enrolled in this study will be recorded 
separately and not listed as a prior med ication.

the study.  Concomitant medications include any prescription, over-the-counter, or natural/herbal 
preparations taken or administered during the study period.  All medications related to reportable 
SAEs should be recorded as defined in Section  8.1. 
7.3.4. Post-Treatment  Anticancer Therapy Status  
The investigator or qualified designee will review all new antineoplastic therapy initiated after 
the last dose of study treatment.  If a subject initiates a new anticancer therapy within [ADDRESS_1044137] the next 
scheduled  safety follow-up (30 or 100 day) visit before the first dose of the new therapy.  
7.4. Safety Assessments  
7.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject signs the ICF.  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs 
throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, 
nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and eCRF s regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug .  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in Section  8. 
All AEs of unknown etiology associated with nivolumab and epacadostat  exposure should be 
evaluated to determine if it is possibly  an irAE.  See Section  5.7.[ADDRESS_1044138] be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician 's assistant, or an advanced r egistered nurse practitioner, as local law 
permits. 
The comprehensive physical examination will include the following organ or body system 
assessments:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system ; 
abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities ; lymph nodes; and a brief neurological exam ination.  Before 
the first dose of study treatment, clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical history.  After C1D1, new clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as 
AEs. 
7.4.3. Targeted Physical  Examination 
For cycles that do not re quire a full physical exam ination per the schedules of assessments 
(Table 18, Table 19, and  Table 24), the investigator or qualified designee will perform a directed 
physical exam ination as clinically indicated before study treatment administration.  A targeted 
physical examination will be a symptom-directed evaluation conducted by [CONTACT_1719].  The targeted physical examination will include assessment(s) of the body systems or

abnormal findings should be recorded as AEs. 
7.4.4. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], body temperature , and 
weight.  Height will be measured at screening only . 
7.4.5. Twelve-Lead Electrocardiograms  
Baseline ECGs will be obtained at  screening.  Additional ECGs will be performed on study at 
C1D1 and C1D15 for Phase 1 Part 1 and at C1D1 and C2D1 for Phase 1 Part 2; within [ADDRESS_1044140] dose of epacadostat  (unless emerging  data suggest alternate timing); 
predose on C1D15 for Phase [ADDRESS_1044141] from the study based on an ECG flagged as " Abnormal, Clinically Significant " is the 
responsibility of the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor's medical monitor, as 
appropriate.  Prolonged QTc intervals must be read by a cardiologist.  The correction method 
(Fridericia  or Bazett) used for calculating QTc will need to be provided in the eCRF . 
7.4.6. Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory tests for screening period should be performed within [ADDRESS_1044142] practice to evaluate laboratory analytes during chemotherapy regimen .  Subsequently, 
laboratory assessment s will be performed on Day 1 of each cycle in the absence of clinically 
significant abnormalities, which should be monitored at a frequency sufficient to provide 
adequate surveillance.  
All safety laboratory assessments will be performed locally.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Liver Chemistry  Tests 
Liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin , and alkaline phosphatase) will be conducted at 
screening, on C1D1, on Day 1 of every subsequent cycle, at EOT, and at safety follow -up 
(30 days after EOT) for combination cohorts with Q2W nivolumab schedule.  LFT monitoring 
will be conducted at screening,  on C1D1, C1D15, on Day 1 of every subsequent cycle, at EOT, 
and at safety follow -up (30 days after EOT) for combination cohorts with Q4W nivolumab 
schedule.  For combination chemo -immunotherapy cohorts, LFT monitoring will occur on 
C1D1, C1D8, C2D1, C2D8, C3D1, and C3D8; after  Cycle 3, LFTs will be on Day 1 of each 
subsequent cycle , at EOT, at the 30-day safety follow -up visit, and as clinically indicated .  Liver 
chemistry tests will be performed by [CONTACT_779]'s local laboratory, a s well as any twice -per-week 
LFT monitoring if it is required.   If LFT results (ALT, AST , or total bilirubin) are abnormal, 
twice weekly testing of these LFTs will be required until results return to baseline.  Liver 
chemistry  test monitoring for persistent low -grade abnormalities does not need to be monitored 
twice a week indefinitely.  Appropriate LFT monitoring intervals should be discussed with the 
medical monitors for these circumstances.  Throughout the Protocol, LFT refers specifically to 
liver chemistry testing, and r equired analytes for LFTs are listed in Table 26.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing  
Serum pregnancy tests will be analyzed by [CONTACT_762304] .  Subsequently, urine 
pregnancy tests will be conducted on Day [ADDRESS_1044143]'s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the 
pregnancy will be reported to the sponsor without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is an 
SAE (eg, death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life- threatening complication 
to the mother or newborn).  The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to 
follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the 
sponsor.  If a male subject impregnates his female partner , the study personnel at the site must be 
informed immediately and the pregnancy reported to the sponsor and followed as described 
above and in Section  8.5. 
7.5. Efficacy Assessments  
Process for image collection and transmission to the central vendor can be found in the Site 
Imaging Manual.  
7.5.1. Initial Tumor Imaging 
Initial tumor imaging must be performed within [ADDRESS_1044144] v1.1 for solid tumors, Cheson for 
lymphomas, or RANO for glioblastoma .  The baseline imaging scan (or photographs if skin 
lesions present and assessed clinically) should also be submitted to the central imaging vendor.   
Subjects with all tumor types, except subjects with glioblastoma, are required to have a chest and 
abdominal CT scan  for baseline.  Br ain MRI at baseline should also be considered when disea se 
burden due to any targeted tumor types is extensive (ie, when ≥ 3 metastatic dis ease sites are 
involved).  For subjects with MEL, baseline brain MRI is required.  In addition, subjects with 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Document Number IC-DEV-PROT-AMEND-0350.
Printed on: , ; Printed by: .
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1044145] of care at basel ine, imaging 
should continue at specified intervals during study treatment.  Brain imaging for subjects whose 
primary disease is not glioblastoma  should only be performed if there are signs or symptoms 
suggesting CNS disease.   For subjects with glioblastoma , tumor measurements and volumetric 
MRI of the head is also required  within 14 days before the start of study drug.  Subjects with  
glioblastoma  who are unable (due to existent medical condition, ie, pacemaker or implantable 
cardioverter defibri llator device) or unwilling to have a head MRI at baseline are excluded from 
the study. 
Scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as the screening 
scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within [ADDRESS_1044146] v1.1 ( Appendix E ), Cheson ( Appendix F ), or RANO 
(Appendix H ) criteria should be followed.  For example, RECIST discourages selection of target 
lesions inside the field of prior irradiation.  Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in 
an area subjected to other locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless it is 
the solitary site of measurable disease AND there has been demonstrated progression in the 
lesion.  Also, if a subject has only [ADDRESS_1044147] 
throughout the study.  Imaging should be performed 8 and 16 weeks  (± 7 days) after the start of 
treatment for subjects in the combination chemo -immunotherapy cohorts (Phase 1 Part 2) and 
then every 12 weeks thereafter.  All other subjects (Phase 1 Part 1 and Phase 2) wil l have 
efficacy assessments every 12 weeks.  All subjects will continue to ha ve efficacy assessments 
until the end of treatment; no efficacy  assessments are required during the safety follow -up 
period.  Imaging may be performed more frequently if clinically indicated.  Imaging should not 
be delayed for delays in cycle starts or extension of combination treatment cycle intervals. 
Per RECIST v1.1, response should be confirmed by a repeat radiographic assessment not less 
than [ADDRESS_1044148] indication of response or at the 
next scheduled scan, whichever is clinically indicated.  
7.5.3. Assessment of Disease by [CONTACT_762305] (screening) using a method that is appropriate for disease subtype, per established and modified guidelines ( Cheson et al 20 07 or 
Owen et al 2013 for Waldenström' s macroglobul inemia; Appendix G ), to account for the unique 
tumor response seen in this class of therapeutics .

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 204 Amendment 8  Version 8  31 MAY 2018 
[IP_ADDRESS]. CT Scan or MRI  for Lymphoma Evaluation 
Subjects with HL will undergo CT or MRI to evaluate measurable disease during the screening 
period.  If CT/MRI assessment was performed, under standard of care, before signing of the ICF  
but within 28 days of C1D 1, the result of that assessment may be recorded in the CRF in lieu of a 
study-specific assessment.  On -treatment assessments (for subjects with disease measurable by 
[CONTACT_462]) should be performed every 8 weeks following C1D1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FDG-PET or Combined PET- CT 
If positron emission tomography (PET) using [18 F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) or combined 
PET-CT is used as a functional imaging tool for staging or response assessment of lymphoma as 
a part of the standard of care, the results obtained during any study phase will be captured in the 
CRF.  
7.5.4. Assessment of Disease by  [CONTACT_762306]-assessed tumor response will be based on modified published RANO criteria 
(Appendix H ) and will be adapted for defining PD  to account for the unique tumor response seen 
in this class of therapeutics .  Radiologic response will be assessed by [CONTACT_762307]- treatment MRI scans.   Radiologic progression will be determined by [CONTACT_762308].  Table 27 describes  the radiologic and clinical criteria that will be used f or 
determining tumor response.

Table 27: RANO Criteria for Response Assessment Incorporating MRI and Clinical 
Factors 
Response  Criteria 
Complete 
response Requires all of the following:  
• Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and nonmeasurable disease 
sustained for at least 4 weeks . 
• No new lesions . 
• Stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions . 
• Subjects must be off corticosteroids (or on physiologic replacement doses only). 
• Stable or improved clinically.  
Note:  Subjects with nonmeasurable disease only cannot have a complete response; the best 
response possible is SD. 
Partial response Requires all of the following:  
• ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular 
diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks . 
• No progression of nonmeasurable disease. 
• No new lesions . 
• Stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared with baseline scan . 
• The corticosteroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the 
dose at time of baseline scan . 
• Stable or improved clinically . 
Note:  Subjects with nonmeasurable disease only cannot have a PR; the best response 
possible is SD. 
Stable disease Requires all of the following:  
• Does not qualify for complete response, PR, or progression . 
• Stable nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids 
compared with baseline scan.  In the event that the corticosteroid dose was increased for 
new symptoms and signs without confirmation of disease progression on neu roimaging, 
and subsequent follow -up imaging shows that this increase in corticosteroids was 
required because of disease progression, the last scan considered to show SD will be the 
scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose.  
Progression  Defined by [CONTACT_39132]:  
• ≥ 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions 
compared with the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline (if no decrease) or best response, on stable o r increasing doses of corticosteroids.a 
• Significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesions on stable or increasing doses of 
corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapya 
not cause by [CONTACT_186754] (eg, radiation therapy, demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or other treatment effects). 
• Any new lesion . 
• Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor 
(eg, seizures, medication adverse effects, complications of therapy, cerebrovascular 
events, infection, and so on) or changes in corticosteroid dose . 
• Failure to return for evaluation as a result of death or deteriorating condition; or clear 
progression of nonmeasurable disease.  
FLAIR = fluid -attenuated inversion recovery.  
Note:  Radiologic interpretation guidelines, definitions , and tumor measurement instructions will be provided separatel y.  All 
measurable and nonmeasurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as at baseline.  
a Stable doses of corticosteroids include subjects not on corticosteroids.

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1044149] 's BOR assignment will depend on the findings of both 
target and nontarget disease, and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions.  
The assessments that will contribute to the evaluation of BOR include the response assessment 
recorded b etween the date of randomization and the first to occur of the following: 
1. The date of objectively documented progression per RANO criteria
OR
2. The date of subsequent therapy
OR
3. The date of pathology results from diagnostic surgical resection
Among the available response assessment, the criteria listed in Table 28 will be used to 
determine BOR.  
Table 28: Assessment of Best Overall Response  
Best Overall Response  Criteria 
Complete response (CR) CR observed in consecutive assessments  ≥ 4 weeks apart per RANO . 
Partial response (PR) PR observed in consecutive assessments  ≥ 4 weeks apart per RANO . 
Stable disease (SD)a SD observed an d dose not quality for CR or PR.  
Or 
Suspected PD followed with histologic results not confirming PD, and no CR, PR , or 
SD observed . 
Not evaluable (NE) Insufficient data to determine di sease progression or response . 
Progressive disease (PD) No CR, PR, or SD before PD. 
CR = complete response; NE = not evaluable; PD = progressive disease; PR = partial response; SD = stable disease.  
a To qualify for SD there must be a minimum on-treatment period of [ADDRESS_1044150] determined.  
For purposes of this study, the minimum duration between baseline (sta rt of treatment) and first 
on-study scan in order to determine BOR of SD is [ADDRESS_1044151]'s best response will depend on the subsequent assessments.  For example, a su bject who has SD at a timepoint < [ADDRESS_1044152] response of PD.

approximately 12 hours apart.   
Epacadostat  compliance will be calculated by [CONTACT_762309]/designee (tablet counts).  The 
objective is 100% compliance, and investigators and their staff should evaluate compliance at 
each visit  and take appropriate steps to optimize com pliance. 
7.7.4. Dispensing of Epacadostat 
An initial bulk supply of epacadostat  will be provided to investigative sites before enrollment of 
the first subject.  Thereafter, the site staff will contact [CONTACT_762310] -supply of epacadostat .  
When dispensing to subjects, the investigator or designee will remove the appropriate quantity of 
epacadostat  from their stock, dispense the medication, and enter the amount dispensed into the 
eCRF and drug accountability log.  Full details will be provided in the Study Manual. 
7.7.5. Dispensing of Nivolumab 
An initial bulk supply of nivolumab will be provided to investigative sites before enrollment of 
the first subject.  Thereafter, the site will contact [CONTACT_762310]- supply of nivolumab.  The 
investigator or designee will calculate the number of nivolumab vials needed, pull the 
appropriate number of vials to prepare the infusion solution, and enter the vials used into the 
eCRF and drug accountability log.  Full details will be provided in the Study Manual.  
7.7.6. Distribution of Subject Reminder Cards  
Subjects will be provided with reminder cards at each visit.  The subject reminder cards will 
indicate the date/time of the next visit and will also remind the subject when they should not take 
their morning dose of study drug and when they should arrive for the visit.  On Day [ADDRESS_1044155] discontinues or withdraws before study completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final study visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation.  Any AEs 
that are present at t he time of discontinuation or withdrawal should be followed in accordance 
with the safety requirements outlined in Section  8.1.1.  These subjects sh ould return to the site 
for the safety follow -up visits (described in Section  6.4.1) during the 100- day safety follow -up 
period.

8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1. Definitions  
For the purposes of this Protocol, an adverse event ( AE) is defined as the appearance o f (or 
worsening of any pre -existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) that 
occur after a subject  provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results 
occurring after informed consent constitute AEs  only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, 
are considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg , hematologic abnormality that requires 
transfusion), or require changes in the study drug (s). 
8.1.2. Reporting  
Adverse events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events page  of the eCRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History page of the eCRF.  Adverse event monitoring should 
be continued for at least [ADDRESS_1044156] dose of study drug .  Adverse events (including 
laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever 
possible rather than  by [CONTACT_147108].  When a clear diagnosis 
cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE . 
The term "disease progression " should be recorded as an AE/SAE only if there are no other 
identifiable AEs/SAEs associated with the disease progression a t the time of reporting.   For 
events associated with disease progression, the relevant signs and symptoms should be reported 
using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.  When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a 
separate AE.   If the events resulting from disease progression meet the criteria for an SAE 
(eg, resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a life -threatening event, or death), the specific event(s) should be 
reported as  an SAE(s) as described in  Section 8.3.2.  In both cases (ie, AEs or SAEs related to 
disease progression), it should be indicated that each event (reported as a diagnosis or as signs 
and symptoms) is related to disease progression on the Adverse Events form of the eCRF. 
The severity of AEs  will be assessed according to the CTCAE v 4.0 Grades 1 through Grade 4.  
The CTCAE v4.0 severity Grade 5 (death) w ill not be used in this study; AEs resulting in death 
will be graded accordingly using Grades [ADDRESS_1044157] the outcome noted as fatal.  If an 
event is not classified by [CONTACT_3989], the severity of the AE will be graded according to the scale 
below to estimate the grade of severity:   
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive inter vention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate activities of daily living.  
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily living.  
Grade 4 Life-threatening con sequences; urgent intervention indicated.

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1044158], or other assessments.  As far as 
possible, each AE  should be evaluated to determine: 
•The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to 4).
•Reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study treatment:  unrelated (no) or
related (yes).
NOTE:  Since this is a study of epacadostat  combined with other study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the
relationship to study drug can be assessed for epacadostat  alone, nivolumab alone,
epacadostat  combined with each study therapy administered , or not related to either
epacadostat  or other study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
•Start and end dates, unless unresolved at final exam ination.
•Action taken with respect to study drug  (eg, none, dose adjusted, temporarily
interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable).
•Outcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving,
recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown).
•Whether it is serious, as per SAE  definition provided in Section  8.3.1.
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements, see Section  8.3.2. 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If a concomitant medication or nondrug therapy is 
given, this action should be recorded on the AE and Prior/Concomitant medications  pages of the 
eCRF. 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat it, and the outcome. 
When the severity of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits), each 
change in severity will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves.   For example, 
[ADDRESS_1044159] has Grade 1 diarrhea, meeting the definition of an AE, that lasts for 3 days before worsening to a Grade 3 severity.  The Grade 1 event will be 
reported as an AE with a start date equal to the day the event met the Grade 1 AE definition and  
a stop date equal to the day that the event increased in severity from Grade 1 to Grade 3.  The Grade 3 event will also be reported as an AE, with the start date equal to the day the event changed in intensity from Grade 1 to Grade 3 and a stop date equal to the day that the event 
either changed severity again or resolved.

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1044160] Abnormalities  
8.2.1. Definitions and Reporting  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (are considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes 
in study drug ), should be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.  Whenever possible, a diagnosis 
rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, anemia instead of low hemoglobin).  Laboratory 
abnormalit ies that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have returned to 
normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal laboratory 
test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not necessary to 
separately record the lab oratory test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 AE , as per CTCAE , does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the 
definition of serious, as defined in Section  8.3.1, and/or per the investigator's discretion.  A dose 
interruption or adjustment for the laboratory  abnormality may be required (see Section  5.7.2) and 
should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  abnormality as  an SAE. 
8.2.2. Potential Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur before the reporting of a potential drug-induced liver injury event.   All occurrences of 
potential drug-induced liver injur ies, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see 
Section 8.3.2 for reporting details).  
Potential drug-induced liver injury is defined as : 
1.AT (ALT or AST) elevation > [ADDRESS_1044161]
AND
2.Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1044162], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum
alkaline phosphatase),
AND
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia,
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or acute liver disease, or
the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
In addition, Potential Hy 's Law cases must also be reported as SAEs ( Section 8.3.2).  A Potential 
Hy's Law case is defined as any situation where a study subject has an increase in AST or ALT 
≥ 3 × ULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN, irrespective of alkaline phosphatase , at any 
point during the study following the start of study medication.

8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
A SAE is defined as an event that meets 1 of the following criteria : 
•Is fatal or life -threatening (ie, immediate risk of dying) .
•Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity .
•Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect .
•Is clinically meaningful  (ie, defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or
requires potential medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed
above).  Considered meaningful by [CONTACT_762311], be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be
considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize
the subject  or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the
outcomes listed in this definition.
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a result of :
− Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication  not associated with any
deterioration in condi tion. 
− Elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to 
the indication under study and has not worsened si nce signing the  ICF. 
− Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
− Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], in the absence of any deterioration in the subject 's 
general condition . 
− Any SAEs that are expected due to the condition being treated, including if the SAE is a primary outcome measure, or where there has been a clear agreement 
with regulators not to consider these as SAEs, provided the information is 
collected elsewhere. 
8.3.2. Reporting  
To ensure subject safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring aft er the 
subject has signed the ICF and up to the EOT visit, or up to [ADDRESS_1044163] be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 
24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  Any SAEs experienced after this period should be 
reported to the sponsor ( or designee) only if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the 
study drug.  Recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be 
reported as the follow-up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours of the i nvestigator receiving the 
follow-up information.  An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered 
completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 204 Amendment 8  Version 8  31 MAY 2018 
Previously planned ( before providing informed consent) surgeries should not be reported as 
SAEs unless the underlying medical condition worsens over the course of the study. 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form.  The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each specific 
study drug (if there is more than 1), complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the 
completed, signed form by [CONTACT_87109] [ADDRESS_1044164] assess if there is a r easonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  
unrelated ( no) or related (yes). 
Serious AEs related to unblinded comparator drugs or concomitant medications/drug delivery systems are reported directly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package insert.  
The telephone and facsimile  number of the sponsor's contact [CONTACT_122473], specific to the study , are 
listed in the investigator folder provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the eCRF  documentation at the study site. 
Follow-up information is sent to the same person to whom the original SAE Report Form was sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported 
SAE and giving the date of the original report.  Each recurrence, complication, or progression of 
the original event should be repor ted as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs.  
The follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and 
how it was treated , and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation, or if 
study drug was interrupted or discontinued. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the IB for the study drug (new occurrence) and is 
thought to be related to the sponsor' s study drug , a sponsor's associate may urgently require 
further information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities . 
The sponsor or its designee may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN)  to inform all 
investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions will be collected and reported to the 
competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC , 
or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
8.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
Not applicable. 
8.5. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_147066] a contraceptive medication or method.  When a pregnancy has been confirmed, including the pregnancy of a male subject' s female partner that 
occurs during the study or within 150 days of completing the study, the following procedures should occur: 
• The investigator must notify the sponsor or its designee immediately .  
• The study drug must be discontinued immediately .

•The subject must be withdrawn from the study.
•The EOT visit evaluations  must be performed.
•The investigator must complete and submit the Pregnancy Initial and Follow-Up
Report forms to the sponsor or its designee.
•A serum pregnancy test must be performed to confirm the urine pregnancy test result.
(The serum test should be performed at the investigative site to ensure the test will be
performed promptly and the result available immediately for review.)
If a negative serum test does not confirm the urine pregnancy test result, then: 
•The investigator will use his or her expert judgment, based on an assessment of the
potential benefit/risk to the subject, to determine if it is in the subject' s best interest t o
resume study drug and continue participation in the study.
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subject during maternal or paternal exposures to study drug  must be reported within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.   
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation.  Follow-up to each pregnancy should be conducted to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of a ny 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by [CONTACT_352978]- baby [CONTACT_765].  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Preg nancy 
Form and reported by [CONTACT_89211].  Pregnancy follow-up 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the sponsor' s study drug of any pregnancy outcome and follow-up to the first 
well-baby [CONTACT_765].  Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE 
Report Form and to the sponsor or its  designee.  
8.6. Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of 
Overdose to the Sponsor  
For purposes of this study , an overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional a dministration 
of any dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important.  All 
occurrences of overdose must be reported as an SAE (see Section  8.3.2 for reporting details).  
8.7. Warnings and Precautions  
No evidence available at the time of the approval of this study P rotocol indicated that special 
warnings or precautions were appropriate, other than those noted in the provided IB.  Additional 
safety information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of 
Investigator Notifications  (INs).  Any important new safety information should be discussed with 
the subject during the study as needed.  If new, significant risks are identified, they will be added 
to the ICF.

8.8. Safety Monitoring Committee  
There will be no formal external Safety Monitoring Committee  (SMC) for the combination 
immunotherapy Phase [ADDRESS_1044165] telephone conferences with investigators in order to review cohort- specific data, 
overall safety data from prior cohorts (if applicable), and to agree on dose escalation, 
de-escalation, and cohort expansion decisions.  For Phase 2, safety and tolerability will be 
carefully monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_762312]  9.6. 
Due to the complexity of the study, for the combination chemo-immunotherapy cohorts in the 
Part [ADDRESS_1044166] be recorded as such in the eCRF and should be reported 
to the sponsor within 72 hours.  These events include irAEs that are seen with  nivolumab and 
epacadostat  therapy and any other o bserved autoimmune phenomenon. 
For this study they include: 
1.An elevated AST or ALT lab oratory value that is ≥ 3 × ULN and an elevated total
bilirubin lab oratory value that is ≥ 2 × ULN as determined by [CONTACT_658663]-specified
laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.
Note:  These criteria are based on available regulatory guidance documents.  The purpose
of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an
additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  The study site guidance for assessment
and follow-up of these criteria can be found in Section  8.2.2.
2.Any of the following AEs:
a.≥ Grade 3 diarrhea
b.≥ Grade 3 colitis
c.≥ Grade 2 pneumonitis
d.≥ Grade 3 hypo- or hyperthyroidism
e.≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1044167] additional testing to rule out other causes.  If no other cause is 
found, then the event should be considered to be immune -related.

Also, as noted in Section  1.3.1, there is a possibility that epacadostat  could cause an increase in 
serotonin levels in the brain that might trigger SS  when administered in combination with other 
serotonergic agents ( Boyer and Shannon 2005).  This syndrome has been most closely associated 
with use of MAOIs, Demerol®, linezolid, or methylene blue; all of these agents are prohibited 
during the study.  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs are permitted in the study.  
Procedures list ed in Section  5.7.[ADDRESS_1044168] from the date of C1D1 through 
100 days after cessation of treatment, or the initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever is 
earlier, whether or not related to the sponsor's product, should be reported within [ADDRESS_1044169] complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by [CONTACT_165941]. 
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete description of the 
product complaint and any associated AEs via email or other written communication to the 
Incyte contact . 
If the investigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the 
product complaint communication  with the product.

9.2. Selection of Sample Size  
9.2.1. Cohort Size in Part 1 and Part 2 of Phase 1  Study 
The primary objective of the open- label Part 1 of Phase 1 study is to determine  the RP2D of 
epacadostat  in combination with nivolumab, and the primary objective of Part 2 of Phase 1 is to 
determine the  safe dose of epacadostat in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy.  The 
total number of subjects will depend on the number of dose levels tested before the MTD  or 
PAD is established.  Up to approximately 63 subjects (9  subjects per dose level for 7 dose levels ) 
will be enrolled in Part 1 of Phase 1 for the dose escalation  of epacadostat when administered 
with nivolumab ( the combination immunotherapy cohorts).  Up to 81 subjects (9 subjects per 
dose level for up to 3 dose levels in 3 combination chemo-immunotherapy cohorts ) will be 
enrolled in Part 2 of Phase 1 for the dose finding of epacadostat in combination with nivolumab 
and chemotherapy  (the combination chemo -immunotherapy cohorts).  Additionally, 30 subjects 
will be enrolled into  each of the safety expansion of combination chemo -immunotherapy cohorts  
(epacadostat + nivolumab + chemotherapy):  Cohort A, Cohort B, and Cohort C.  Table 32 below 
tabulates the probability of observing a toxicity in a cohort of 30 subjects for various event rates.  Overall sample size in  Phase 1 (Part 1 and Part 2) will be up to approximately  234 subjects.

10% 95.8% 
15% 99.2% 
20% 99.9% 
9.2.2. Sample Size for the Dose-Expansion Portion (Phase 2) of the Study  
The sample size of 25 subjects are expected to be enrolled in each of the 4 low historic response expansion cohorts (CRC, SCCHN, ovarian cancer , and DLBCL) a s well as in each of  
I/O-relapsed MEL and I/O-refractory  MEL cohorts and 50 subjects in each of the 2 higher 
historic ORR cohorts (NSCLC and I/O-naive MEL).  The sample size for each independent 
cohort yields a power of 80% to detect the following :  1) a target ORR of 17% to 26% increase 
(Ha) from historical response rate (H0) or 2) a PFS rate at 6 months of 1 4% to 22% increase (Ha) 
from historical survival probability (H0).  This assumes a 1-sided alpha of 2.5% for each of the 
endpoint within a cohort (based on Bonferroni adjustment due to dual primary endpoints), 10% lost to follow -up, enrollment period of 6 to 10 months (depends on cohort), and 6 to 10 months 
of follow-up (depends on cohort) after last subject enrolled.  See details  in Table 33.  
Twenty-eight subjects are expected to be enrolled in the glioblastoma cohort.  This sample size 
for the glioblastoma  cohort yields a power of 80% to detect an OS rate at 9 months of 25% 
increase (Ha) from historical survival probability (H0).  This assumes a 1-sided alpha of 5%, 10% lost to follow-up, enrollment period of [ADDRESS_1044170] enrolled.  Details are shown in Table 34.

9.3. Level of Significance  
The level of significance for the each of the 2 primary endpoints in Phase 2 is 1-sided 2.5% for 
the NSCLC, MEL  (including I/O -naive, I/O-relapsed, and I/O- refractory cohorts) , SCCHN, 
DLBCL, OC , and CRC cohorts, which is based on Bonferroni correction for Type I error 5% due 
to dual primary endpoints.  The level of significance is 1-sided 5% for the glioblastoma  cohort. 
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1. Primary Analyses 
Objective response rate and PFS are the dual primary endpoints for the  solid tumor and DLBCL 
cohorts in Phase 2 .  Overall survival at 9 months is the  only primary endpoint in the glioblastoma 
cohort.  The Type I error will be controlled using Bonferroni method for each cohort with dual 
primary endpoints.  As a  result, the overall family wise Type I error of the study (across all tumor 
types studied) is not controlled, but within each Phase [ADDRESS_1044171] response (CR or PR) by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 and Cheson criteria for DLBCL .  The 95% exact CI  for the ORR will be estimated using the Clopper -Pearson

9.4.4. Saf
ety Analyses 
The principal analysis will be based on the safety evaluable population, according to treatment 
assignment.  
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_165942], and incidences will be tabulated by [CONTACT_593296], related events, and events from Grade 1 through 
Grade 4.  Severity of AEs will be based on the CTCAE  scale as indicated in Section  8.1.1.  
Quantitative safety variables and their changes from baseline (laboratory, vital signs) will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  Clinically significant abnormal values will be flagged and tabulated based on predefined criteria. 
Exposure will be analyzed by [CONTACT_165944], which is defined as the dose received 
divided by [CONTACT_165945] a given time interval.  This will be done by [CONTACT_762314].  For each cycle, incidences of dose reductions and cycle delays will also 
be tabulated, by [CONTACT_762315].  The percentage of subjects with any delay 
and/or reduction will also be calculated.  
9.4.5. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
The clinical laboratory data will be analyzed using summary statistics (eg, means and 
frequencies), and no formal statistical comparisons among the treatments are planned.  In 
addition, distributions of key laboratory parameters (including hemoglobin, neutrophils, and platelets) will be plotted over time; these values will also be classified into CTCAE toxicity 
grades and tabulated.  Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will be determined for vital signs at each assessment time.  Vital sign results will be reviewed for clinically notable abnormalities.  
9.5. Analyses for the Safety Monitoring Committee  
There will be n o formal SMC for the combination immunotherapy cohorts in Phase 1 Part 1 and 
Phase 2; however, ongoing safety reviews will be performed  as described in Section  9.6. 
Details regarding safety data to be evaluated by [CONTACT_762316] 1  Part 2 will be specified in

10.2. Accountability, Handling, and Disposal of Epacadostat  and 
Nivolumab  
Responsibility for drug accountability at the study site rests with the investigator; however, the 
investigator may assign some of the drug accountability duties to an appropriate pharmacist or 
other designee.  Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available 
for inspection by [CONTACT_762317].  
The investigator or designee will be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially 
used containers of study drug  until the end of the study.  The i nvestigator or designee must 
maintain records that document: 
•Delivery of study drug to the study site .
•Inventory of study drug at the site .
•Subject use of the study drug including pi[INVESTIGATOR_762252].
•Return of study drug  to the investigator or designee by [CONTACT_1766].
These records should include dates, quantities, batch or serial numbers (if available), and the unique code numbers (if available) assigned to the investigational product and study subjects. 
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the correct study drug specified.  
Completed accountability records will be archived by [CONTACT_779].  The investigator or designee will be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug until verified by [CONTACT_11200] (unless otherwise agreed to by [CONTACT_456]).  At the 
completion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining 
epacadostat  back to the sponsor or its  designee for destruction according to institutional standard 
operating procedures.  If local procedures mandate site destruction of investigational supply, the 
site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study 
monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of accountability by [CONTACT_3878].   At sites where the study drug is destroyed before 
monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP. 
Infusion related supplies (eg, IV bags, in-line filters, 0.9% NaCl solution) for nivolumab will not 
be supplied by [CONTACT_20448]. 
10.2.1. Disposal of Epacadostat and Nivolumab  
Upon completion or termination of the study, all unused and/or partially used nivolumab will be 
destroyed at the site per institutional policy.  It is the investigator 's responsibility to arrange for 
disposal of all empty containers, provided that procedures for proper disposal have been 
established according to applicable federal, state, local , and institutional guidelines and 
procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept.

according to a predetermined monitoring plan.  Monitoring visits provide the sponsor with the 
opportunity to: 
•Evaluate the progress of the study.
•Verify the accuracy and completeness of eCRFs.
•Assure that all Protocol requirements, applicable laws and/or regulations, and
investigator' s obligations are being fulfilled .
•Resolve any inconsistencies in the study records.
The investigator must allow the study monitors to periodically review, at mutually convenient 
times during the study and after the study has been completed, all CRFs and office, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and laboratory records supporting the participation of each subject in the study.  The eCRF s and 
other documentation supporting the study must be kept up- to-date by [CONTACT_165950].  These study materials must be available for review by [CONTACT_11200], and/or other qualified representatives of the sponsor or its designee , at each 
monitoring visit.  
The study monitor will review the various records of the study ( eCRFs, subject medical and 
laboratory records, and other pertinent data).  The study monitor will verify the eCRF  data 
against original source documentation for accuracy and completeness.  The study monitor will 
identify data discrepancies and collaborate with the investigator and research staff to resolve the 
discrepancies in a timely manner.  Protocol deviation s will also be identified and recorded on a 
"Protocol Deviation Log."  The study monitor will follow an "Issue Escalation " plan in order to 
ensure that each issue identified during a monitoring visit is appropriately documented, reported, 
and resolved in a timely manner in accordance with the plan 's requirements.

APPENDIX C. MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS  
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the investigator and may be supplemented by 
[CONTACT_762321].  The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology (I-O) agents and regimens.  
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice.  Noninflammatory etiologies should be considered and appropria tely 
treated.  
Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for I-O drug-related adverse events.  The oral equivalent of 
the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with low-grade toxicity.  
The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account when switching to 
the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.  
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended .  
The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by [CONTACT_711888] I-O agent or regimen being used.

APPENDIX F. RESPONSE CRITERIA FOR LYMPHOMA 
LYMPHOMA COMPLETE RESPONSE, PARTIA L RESPONSE, STABLE DISEASE, 
RELAPSED /PROGRESSIVE DISEASE  RESPONSE CRITERIA ( Cheson et al 2007) 
Complete Response (CR) 
The designation of CR requires the following:  
1.Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease- related
symptoms such as 'B symptom' if present before therapy.
2. a. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma:  in patients with  no pretreatment PET scan or when 
the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post- treatment residual mass of any size 
is permitted as long as it is PET negative.  
b.Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown:  in patients without a
pretreatment PE T scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymp h nodes
and nodal masses must have regressed on CT to normal size (≤ 1.[ADDRESS_1044208] transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved
nodes that were 1.[ADDRESS_1044209] decreased to ≤ 1.0 cm in their short axis after
treatment.
3. The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a physical
examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should beconsidered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related to lymphoma should
disappear.
4. If the bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_22679], the infiltrate must have
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy.  The biopsy sample on which this determination ismade must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core).  If the sample isindeterminate by [CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by [CONTACT_9064].  A sample
that is negative by [CONTACT_248288] a small population of
clonal lymphocytes by [CONTACT_127891] a CR until data become
available demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.
Partial Response (PR) 
The designation of PR requires all of the following: 
1.At least a 50% de crease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to [ADDRESS_1044210] dominant nodes or nodal masses.  These nodes or masses should be selected
according to all of the following:  they should be clearly measurable in at least
2 perpendicular dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the
body; and they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever
these sites are involved.
2. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.
3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥ 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in
the greatest transverse diameter.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 204 Amendment 8  Version 8  31 MAY 2018 
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually
assessable and no measurable disease shou ld be present.
5.Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was
positive before treatment.  However, if positive, the cell type should be specified(eg, large-cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B -cells).  Patients who achieve a CR by [CONTACT_762322], but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will beconsidered partial responders.  When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and aclinical CR was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients
should be considered partial responders.
6. No new sites of disease should be observed.
7.Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma:  for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if the
PET scan was positive before therapy, the post-treatment PET should be positive in at
least 1 previously involved site.
8.Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown:  for patients without a
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pr -treatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be
used.
Stable Disease (SD) 
Stable disease (SD) is defined as the following: 
1.A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed for a
CR or PR, but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see Relapsed Disease [after
CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).
2.Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20358] -avid lymphomas:  the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease
with no new areas of involvement on the post- treatment CT or PET.
3.Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown:  for patients without a
pretreatment PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change
in the size of the previous lesions on the post- treatment CT scan.
Relapsed Disease ( After CR)/Progressive Disease ( After PR, SD)  
Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more than 1.5 cm regardless of 
the short axis.  If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered 
abnormal if its short axis is more than 1.0.  Lymph nodes ≤ 1.0 
× ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_1044211] are mostly benign.  Thus, a therapeuticdecision should not be made solely on the basis of the PET without histologic
confirmation.

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1044212] a 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the product diameters of any previously
involved nodes, or in a single involved node, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic or
hepatic nodules).  To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of
the short axis of less than 1.[ADDRESS_1044213] increase by ≥ 50% and to a size of 1.5 × 1.[ADDRESS_1044214] a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified nodemore than 1 cm in its short axis.
4. Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359]-avid lymphoma or the
lesion was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with
current PET systems (< 1.[ADDRESS_1044215]).
Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal disease.  
For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease.  Disease that is only assessable (eg, pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or absent only, unless, while an abnormality is still noted by [CONTACT_20478], it is found to be 
histologically negative.

APPENDIX H.  RESPONSE CRITERIA FO R GLIOBLASTOMA 
RANO Criteria for Response Assessment Incorporating MRI and Clinical Factors  
Response  Criteria 
Complete response Requires all of the following:  complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and 
nonmeasurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; stable or improved 
non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions; subjects must be off corticosteroids (or on 
physiologic replacement doses only); and stable or improved clinically.  Note:  Subjects 
with nonmeasurable disease only cannot have a complete response; the best response possible is stable disease.  
Partial response Requires all of the following:  ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of 
products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no progression of nonmeasurable disease; no new lesions; stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids 
compared with baseline scan; the corticosteroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation 
should be no greater than the dose at time of baseline scan; and stable or improved 
clinically.  Note:  Subjects with nonmeasurable disease only cannot have a partial 
response; the best response possible is stable disease.  
Stable disease Requires all of the following:  does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or 
progression; stable non- enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared with baseline scan.  In the event that the corticosteroid dose was 
increased for new symptom s and signs without confirmation of disease progression on 
neuroimaging, and subsequent follow -up imaging shows that this increase in 
corticosteroids was required because of disease progression, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the s can obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent 
to the baseline dose.  
Progression  Defined by [CONTACT_39132]:  ≥ 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular 
diameters of enhancing lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurement  obtained 
either at baseline (if no decrease) or best response, on stable or increasing doses of 
corticosteroidsa; significant increase in T2/FLAIR non -enhancing lesions on stable or
increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy
a not cause by [CONTACT_186754] (eg, radiation therapy, demyelination, 
ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or other treatment effects); any 
new lesion; clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor (eg, seizures, medication adverse effects, complications of therapy, cerebrovascular 
events, infection, and so on) or changes in corticosteroid dose; failure to return for evaluation as a result of death or deteriorating condition; or clear progression o f 
non-measurable disease.  
FLAIR = fluid -attenuated inversion recovery.  
Note:  Radiologic interpretation guidelines, definitions and tumor measurement instructions will be provided separately.   All 
measurable and nonmeasurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as at baseline.  
a Stable doses of corticosteroids include subjects not on corticosteroids.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 204 Amendment 8 Version 8  31 MAY 2018 
Amendment (Version) 6  
This amendment has 2 purposes: 
•Addition of new immunotherapy/chemotherapy combination cohorts in Phase 1 to
evaluate the safety and tolerability of and to determine the recommended Phase 2dose for epacadostat (INCB24360) and nivolumab in combination with standard-of-
care (SOC) chemotherapy regimens in  subjects with advanced or metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and non− small lung cancer
(NSCLC).  Phase 1 is now divided into 2 parts:  Part 1 is the original combinationimmunotherapy regimen, and Part 2 describes the new combination immunotherapyand chemotherapy regimens.
•Addition of 2 new melanoma (MEL)  cohorts in Phase 2 to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of epacadostat in combination with nivolumab in subjects who relapsed or
are refractory to programmed death receptor -1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1
(PD-L1) therapy.
This amendment includes the following additional changes to Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]-204 Amendment 5 (13 JUL  2016) summarized below.  A redline version of the amendment depi[INVESTIGATOR_762261].

Section 3, Subject Eligibility; Section 4, Investigational Plan; Section 5, Treatment
of Subjects; Section 6, Study Assessments; Section 7, Conduct of Study Assessments
and Procedures; Section 8.8, Safety Monitoring Committee; Section 9, Statistics;
Section 16, References
Description of change:   Two new MEL cohorts have been added in Phase 2 to evaluate
subjects with disease that has relapsed after or is refractory to anti −PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.
Subjects will receive epacadostat 100 mg twice daily (BID) in combination with 480 mg
nivolumab intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks (q4w).  Objectives for the safety andtolerability as well as efficacy of the combination immu notherapy for these cohorts have
been added.  Applicable information regarding the role and rationale for use of
immunotherapy combinations in relapsed and refractory solid tumors has also beenadded.  All relevant Protocol sections, including tables and figures, have been  updated
accordingly.
Rationale for change:   Patients with MEL who have failed prior PD-[ADDRESS_1044245] high unmet need.  Preliminary objective responses were observed
in subjects who had prior anti −PD-1/PD-L1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_411598].  The safety data to
date (Perez et  al 2017) demonstrated that there were fewer dose holds and dose
reductions in patients treated with epacadostat 100 mg BID compared to 300 mg BID in
combination with nivolumab; therefore, the epacadostat dose will initially be 100 mgBID in these new cohorts.
3.Synopsis; Section 1.4, Justification for Treatment Regimen; Section 4.1, OverallStudy Design; Section 4.2, Study Endpoints; Section 5.1.2, Nivolumab
Description of change:   The dose of nivolumab for the relapsed/refractory MEL  cohorts
will be 480 mg via 30- minute IV infusion q4w.  The dose of nivolumab for Phase 1 Part
2 (new chemo -immunotherapy cohorts) will be 360 mg via 30-minute IV infusion every
3 weeks (q3w).  Corresponding pharmacokinetic (PK) justification for these [ADDRESS_1044246] been updated accordingly.
Rationale for change:   A pooled analysis derived from a comprehensive population
pharmacokinetics (PPK) analys is for nivolumab demonstrated that nivolumab PK was
linear, with dose-proportional exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg and similar
across tumor types.  Using the PPK model, the exposures following the administration of
nivolumab 360 mg q3w and 480 mg q4w were simulated.  Based on this analysis , it is
predicted that both 360 mg q3w and 480 mg q4w doses are similar to 240 mg every
2 weeks (q2w) or 3 mg/kg q2w following the administration in subjects who have anapproximately median weight of 80 kg.  Thus, the 360 mg q3w and  480 mg q4w doses
and schedules are supported by [CONTACT_80063]-response analyses and will be used in this study

MEL cohorts, respectively . 
4.Synopsis; Section 3.1, Study Population; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria
(Criteria 4 and 4g)
Description of change:  The definition of glioblastoma has been revised as relapsed or
refractory.
Rationale for change:  To provide a clarification for the definition of eligible
glioblastoma subjects in the study.
5.Synopsis, Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria (Criterion 7); Section 7.8, TumorBiopsy Collection and Analysis
Description of change:   For the new cohorts in Phase 1 Part 2 (chemo-immunotherapy
cohorts) and Phase 2 (immuno- oncology relapsed and refractory MEL cohorts), it is
required that biopsies must be confirmed to contain adequate tumor tissue by [CONTACT_762324].  Inclusion c riterion 7 was also revised to emphasize that the collection
of archived tumor tissue is an alternative to fresh baseline tumor biopsies with medical
monitor approval.  A minimum required number of blocks for archived biopsies will be20 slides (instead of 20-25 slides).
Rationale for change:    To clarify the Protocol text and to ensure that it is clear that
confirmation of tumor tissue presence in biopsy samples is a requirement.
6.Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria
a.Description of change:  Exclusion criteria 1, 1d, 1e, and 1.f have been revised.  The
greater than symbol was updated to greater than or equal to for serum creatinine in
1d; also, the option for glomerular filtration rate in place of creatinine was removed.Alkaline phosphatase was removed from criterion 1e, and criterion 1f was revised forbilirubin restriction based on the updated safety information at the program level.Rationale for change:  Accumulating d ata from the  epacadostat program and lower
risks for the development of liver events, alkaline phosphatase will no longer beevaluated as an eligibility criterion in conjunction with ALT/A ST.  Exclusion
criterion 1d has been updated to allow subjects with serum creatinine < 1.5 × ULN ormeasured or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min to be enrolled in the study.
Exclusion criterion 1f has been revised to allow subjects with total bilirubin< 1.5 × ULN or conjugated (direct) bilirubin < 40% of total bilirubin to be enrolled inthe study.
b.Description of change:   Exclusion criterion 5 has been revised to specify that  any
prior immune-related adverse events (irAEs) must be resolved to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_1044247] dose of epacadostat and nivolumab.  Subjects with any ≥ Grade 3 irAEs (except
lymphopenia or asymptomatic amylase/lipase elevations) from priorimmunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including cytotoxic T -lymphocyte- associated antigen -4 treatment,
are excluded.  Subjects with history of ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1044248] be discussedwith the medical monitor to determine eligibility.Rationale for change:  To provide clarification about pre -existing irAEs that
subjects may have had due to prior treatment before starting to this study and toprovide guidance to the investigators in evaluation of these subjects during screening.

glioblastoma subjects in steroid use due to its permitted use as a part of the SOC.  
d. Description of change:  Exclusion criterion 17 has been revised to specify that 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ab testing is required for screening purposes in countries 
where HC V RNA is not part of the SOC.  In these cases, HCV antibody −positive 
subjects will be excluded.  Subjects who have had definitive treatment for HCV are 
permitted if HCV RNA is undetectable a t screening visit.  Table 24 has been revised 
accordingly.  
Rationale for change:  To clarify the exclusion of subjects identified as at risk for 
viral reactivation and to add country- specific hepatitis screening information . 
e. Description of change:  Exclusion criterion 22 has been updated to specify the 
acceptable QTc interval calculation formulas.  
Rationale for change:  To provi de clarification and flexibility in calculation of QTc 
interval. 
f. Description of change:  Exclusion criterion 29 has been added to exclude subjects 
with bleeding associated with tumors that invade or are adjacent to major blood 
vessels, as shown unequivocally by [CONTACT_20521], or history of bleeding related to disease under study within 3 months of Cycle 1 Day 1 . 
Rationale for change:  Although there is no evidence that epacadostat and/or other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_762262], this exclusion criterion was added for the subject safety. 
7. Synopsis; Section [IP_ADDRESS], Phase 2; Section 4.2.2, Secondary Endpoints; Section 4.3, 
Measures Taken to Avoid Bias; Section 9.4, Statistical Analyses 
Description of change:  The primary response criteria for the efficacy evaluation of solid 
tumors, lymphoma, and glioblastoma have been corrected, as they were included 
"modified" prefixes.  The sections were revised to indicate that secondary endpoint 
efficacy analysis will be performed based on the traditional response criteria ( Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 [RECIST v1.1], Cheson, and Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology [ RANO]) as well as modified versions as described in 
the protocol (modified RECIST, modified Cheson, and modified RANO). 
Rationale for change:   To clarify the primary and secondary endpoint analysis response 
criteria for solid tumors, lymphoma, and glioblastoma.

The primary purpose of this amendment is to include epacadostat updates at the program level as 
well as clarify Phase 1 and Phase 2 cohort enrollments.  
This amendment includes the changes to the Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]-204 Amendment 3 (16 JUL 2015) summarized below.  A redline version of the amendment depi[INVESTIGATOR_147073]. 
1.Section 1.3.1, Risks From Epacadostat
Description of change:   Updated to report that [ADDRESS_1044253] been exposed to
epacadostat as monotherapy and/or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors as of
[ADDRESS_1044254] 2015.
Rationale for change:   Updated with information contained in the recently revised
epacadostat Investigator Brochure.
2.Section 1.4, Justification for Treatment Regimen
Description of change:   Updated the dose justification paragraph, which included
INCB [ZIP_CODE]-201 data supporting the doses of epacadostat used in this study.
Rationale for change:   The section was updated with the most recent data included in
the epacadostat Investigator's Brochure.
3.Synopsis; Section 2.1, Primary Objectives
Description of change:   Clarification was included to state that "objective" response rate
is going to be used as one of the criteria for response measurement analysis, not "overall"
response rate.
Rationale for change:   To be consistent with the statistical analysis section of the
Protocol (Section 9).
4.Synopsis; Section 2.2, Secondary Objectives; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria
(Inclusion Criterion 5); Section 4.1, Overall Study Design; 4.2.2, Secondary
Endpoints
Description of change:   Clarification to specif y that diffuse large B -cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) is included as NHL not HL.
Rationale for change:   To correct the category of DLBCL as it belongs to NHL type not
HL type of lymphoma.
5.Synopsis; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria
Description of change:   Inclusion criterion 4g note was updated to indicate that relapse
is defined as progression following initial line of therapy and if the participant had a
surgical resection for relapsed disease and no antitumor therapy was instituted for up to

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 204 Amendment 8 Version 8  31 MAY 2018 
6. Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion 1f was updated to indicate that total bilirubin 
above the institutional upper limit of normal or conjugated bilirubin ≥ 1.2 × upper limit of 
normal (ULN) is excluded.  If no institutional ULN for conjugated bilirubin is provided, 
conjugated bilirubin > 40% of total bilirubin is excluded. 
Rationale for change:   Revised to be consistent with other epac adostat Protocols.  In 
cases where a benign cause of elevated bilirubin may be presen t (eg, Gilbert's syndrome), 
an exception is clarified to indicate that conjugated (direct) bilirubin > 40% of total 
bilirubin is exc luded.  Conjugated bilirubin need only be tested if total bilirubin is 
elevated. 
7. Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria; Section 6, Study Assessments 
(Table 17, Laboratory Assessments for Screening Through Treatment Phase; 
Table 19, Laboratory T ests:  Required Analytes)  
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion  17 was updated to specify that subjects with 
a known history of or who are positive for h epatitis B (HBsAg reactive) or hepatitis C 
(HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected) will be excluded.  Hepatitis B surface antigen 
antibody, hepatitis B virus DNA, and hepatitis C virus antibody will not be tested in the 
study.  Table 17 and Table 19 were revised accordingly. 
Rationale for change:   The purpose of this change is to clarify the exclusion of patients 
who are identified as at risk for viral reactivation.  The previous criteria excluded patients 
who were vaccinated for hepatitis B and could not provide documentation of prior

8. Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria ; Section 5.11, Restricted 
Medications and Measures; Section 5.12, Prohibited Medications and Measures  
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion 6 was revised  to specify subjects who use 
the systemic steroid or prednisone in doses that  are equivalent to ≥ 10 mg/day within 
7 days (instead of ≥ 7.5 mg within 14 days) prior to the first dose of treatment will not be 
eligible.  The threshold for systemic steroids w as also changed to 10  mg/day in 
Sections 5.11 and 5.12. 
Rationale for change:   Updated  to be consistent with other immunotherapy agents that 
use [ADDRESS_1044255] Exclusion Crite ria 
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion [ADDRESS_1044256] with 
glioblastoma had a major surgery; it must be ≥ 21 days since the surgery performed prior 
to enrollment.  
Rationale for change:   This criterion was aligned with inclusion criterion 4g.

10.Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion 22 was updated to indicate that subjects with
a screening QTc interval > 480 milliseconds (instead of 470 milliseconds) will be
excluded.
Rationale for change:   Based on the QTc interval analysis conducted in Phase 1 and
Phase 2 epacadostat studies, no clinically meaningful changes or trends were observed in
QTc interval prolongation and the relationship betw een epacadostat plasma concentration
and QTc intervals.
11.Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion 27b was removed as it was indicating that if
subjects with unresectable or Stage IV melanoma received prio r anti-CTLA-4 treatment,
they will not be eligible for the study.
Rationale for change:   This criterion was inconsistent with exclusion criterion 4a,
indicating that anti-CTLA-[ADDRESS_1044257]-line treatment.
12.Synopsis; Section 4.1 Overall Study Design
Description of change:   The text was revised to allow subjects with colorectal cancer
(CRC) to be enrolled in 300 mg cohort in Phase 1.
Rationale for change:   This change will allow CRC subjects to be enrolled in Phase 1
300 mg cohort as it was initially planned and approved in the original study design.
There was no safety concern when the previous Protocol was amended to exclude CRC
subjects from the 300 mg Phase 1 cohort.
13.Synopsis; Section 4.1.1, Phase 1 Dose -Escalation Design
Description of change:   The text was revised to specify that additional Phase [ADDRESS_1044258] 100 mg BID, and 300 mg is
elected as RP2D, then the remaining subjects enrolled in these cohorts may be treated
with epacadostat 300 mg BID.  The study design schematic (Figure 1) was updatedaccordingly.
Rationale for change:   The additional tumor types may be added in the Phase 2 100 mg
BID cohorts, which will be conducted in parallel to the Phase 1 300 mg BID cohort.  This
will allow further safety and efficacy data to be obtained in other tumor types before
determining the recommended dose for Phase 2 expansion.

19.Synopsis; Section 5.11, Restricted Medications and Measures
Description of change:   Guidelines for coumarin-based anticoagulants were updated and
a table recommending a warfarin dose adjustment b ased on various epacadostat doses
was included.
Rationale for change:   Based on the observed magnitude of epacadostat/warfarin PK
interaction and PK/PD modeling results from a completed drug-drug interaction study,
for an epacadostat dose of [ADDRESS_1044260] after initiation of epacadostat administration based on
approximately 30% to 40% reduction in S- and R- warfarin oral clearance values.  Close
INR monitoring is recommended for subjects on a s table dose of warfarin who are
starting treatment with epacadostat.  Based on this PK/PD modeling, a table of
recommendations for warfarin dose modifications for subjects was added.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 204 Amendment 8 Version 8  31 MAY 2018 
Amendment (Version) 3  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to change the dose for nivolumab for Phase 2 to a flat 
dose (240 mg) and to update the study design to allow the Phase 2 NSCLC and melanoma 
expansion cohorts to open with the 100 mg BID dose of INCB024360 once 100 mg BID is 
determined to be safe in Phase 1. 
This amendment includes the changes to the Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]-204 Amendment 2 (03 APR 
2015) summarized below.  A red-line version of the amendment depi[INVESTIGATOR_762264]. 
1. Synopsis; Section 1.4, Justification for Treatment Regimen; Section 2.2, Secondary 
Objectives; Section 4.1.2, Overall Study Design; Section 5.1.2, Nivolumab 
Description of change:   The dose of nivolumab for the Phase 2 expansion cohorts was 
changed to from 3 mg/kg via 60-minute IV infusion to [ADDRESS_1044263] been added to Section 4.1 to support this dose 
change. 
Rationale for change:  Nivolumab PK was determined to be linear, with dose 
proportional exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg and similar across tumor 
types.  Further preliminary data indicate that nivolumab PK are similar in nonsolid and solid tumors.  Nivolumab clearance and volume of distribution were found to increase 
with increasing body weight, but the increase was less than proportional, indicating that a 
milligram per kilogram dose represents an overadjustment for the effect of body weight on nivolumab PK.  Conversely, given the relationship between nivolumab PK and body 
weight, a flat dose is expected to lead to lower exposures in heavier subjects, relative to 
the exposures in lighter subjects.  It should be noted that a dose of 240 mg nivolumab is identical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for subjects weighing 80 kg, which is the approximate 
median body weight of subjects in the 3 Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies of nivolumab monotherapy.  Nivolumab has been shown to be safe and well tolerated up to a dose level of 10 mg/kg, and the relationship between nivolumab exposure produced by 3 mg/kg and 
efficacy has been found to be relatively flat.  Thus, the 240 mg every-2-weeks dose and 
schedule is supported by [CONTACT_49874], efficacy, and exposure- response analyses results . 
2. Synopsis; Se ction 4.1.1, Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Design 
Description of change:   For the dose-escalation portion of the study (Phase 1), the 
number of subjects was reduced from 15 to 9 subjects per cohort (total N = 63), and no subjects with colorectal cancer (CRC) wil l be enrolled in the 300 mg cohort.  The design 
has been revised so that if INCB024360 100 mg BID in combination with nivolumab is deemed tolerable in Phase 1, the Phase 2 melanoma and NSCLC expansion cohorts will 
open with INCB024360 100 mg BID in combination with nivolumab. The 300 mg BID 
dose will be tested in parallel to the Phase 2 melanoma and NSCLC cohorts, and if it is 
deemed tolerable, the remaining Phase 2 cohorts may be opened with 300 mg BID as the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).  In Phase 2, i f either melanoma or NSCLC cohorts 
at 100 mg BID enroll < 50% (≤ 25 subjects), the remaining enrollment in either of these cohorts may be treated with INCB024360 300 mg BID at the sponsor's discretion, in lieu of opening cohorts of melanoma and NSCLC with 300 mg BID.  If 300 mg BID is not

tolerated, an intermediate dose of 200 mg BID may be tested or 100 mg BID may be 
selected as the RP2D.  A new figure depi[INVESTIGATOR_762265].  
Rationale for change:   The Phase 1 safety expansion cohort size has been reduced since 
the emerging safety profile of the combination is well tolerated.  The exposure for INCB024360 100 mg BID based on PK measurements is in the range of active levels in 
nonclinical models; therefore, expansion cohorts may be further evaluated at this dose 
while a final dose escalation is completed.  Depending on the enrollment rates, these cohorts may complete enrollment at the initial dose or proceed with the higher dose if 
that is determined to be safe.  
3.Synopsis; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria
a.Description of change:   The inclusion criterion #4a for subjects with non– small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) has been revised to specify Stage III B (vs Stage III) and that
subjects must have received only 1 prior systemic regimen f or Stage IIIB, Stag e IV,
or recurrent NSCLC.
Rationale for change:   Subjects with Stage IIIA disease may be candidates for
surgery and therefore not candidates for this study.  The number of prior regimens for
subjects with NSCLC has been revised to be consistent with current practice for useof nivolumab in this setting.
b.Description of change:   The inclusion criterion #4b for subjects with melanoma has
been revised to indicate that subjects may be treatment -naïve or have received only
1 prior treatment for  advanced or metastatic disease.
Rationale for change:   Based on recent NCCN guidelines, this criteria was revised to
be consistent with current practice for use of nivolumab in this setting.
c.Description of change:   The inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_1044264] havebeen prepared from a formalin fixed paraffin -embedded block obtained within
6 months before  screening .
Rationale for change:   Additional clarification regarding acceptable archived tissue
specimens permitted for inclusion in this study.
4.Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria
a.Description of change:   The exclusion criterion #22 for abnormal electrocardiogram
(ECG) has been revised to indicate that in the event that a single QTc is > [ADDRESS_1044265] may be enrolled if the average QTc for the 3 ECGs is < [ADDRESS_1044266] be < [ADDRESS_1044267]
of the QTc, and subjects with left bundle branch block are excluded.
Rationale for change:  These criteria have been updated to be consistent with
Incyte's current standard language across clinical pro grams for ECG requirements.

b. Description of change:   Use of any prohibited medication listed in Section 5.[ADDRESS_1044268] of exclusion criteria as #28.  
Rationale for change:  Prohibited medications are now included in the exclusion 
criteria so that  these are considered and assessed during the subject screening process 
for enrollment to the study.  
c. Description of change:   Two exclusion criteria for subjects with unresectable or 
Stage IV melanoma that were previously included in the inclusion criteria section 
were moved to the exclusion criteria section (subjects with ocular melanoma and 
subjects treated with prior anti–CTLA -4).  
Rationale for change:  Given these 2  criteria are exclusions they were moved to 
appropriate section of the Protocol for ease of reference.  
5. Section [IP_ADDRESS], Procedures and Guidelines for Pneumonitis; Section 6, Study 
Assessments (Tables 14, 15, and 18); Section 7.4.7, Pulmonary Function Tests 
Description of change:   Pulmonary function testing was removed from the screening 
assessments and from the subject evaluation recommended for symptomatic pneumonitis. 
Rationale for change:   All subjects are required to have baseline CT scans of the chest at 
baseline, which provides reasonable baseline assessment for a subject's pulmonary status.  
Oxygen saturation is also assessed at baseline as well as on -study treatment in order to 
continually assess the subject's pulmonary status. 
6. Section 6, Study Assessments (Tables 14 and 18) 
Description of change:   In Table 14, targeted physical examinat ion was added to 
Cycle 2, Days 15, 29, and 43.  In Table 18, HPV (for subjects with SCCHN only) and 
MSI (for subjects with CRC only) were added to the table of required analytes for 
laboratory tests.  
Rationale for change:   Targeted physical examination was omitted from table for these 
visits.  HPV and MSI were added for consistency to match table with text in other relevant sections .

Description of change:   Revised to indicate that screening laboratory tests should be 
performed within [ADDRESS_1044269] be repeated before study treatment initiation (C ycle 1 Day 1).  
Rationale for change:   Guidance for timing of screening laboratory tests has been 
updated for consistency with exclusion criteria, which notes that laboratory assessments 
performed within 7 days do not need to be repeated on Cycle 1  Day 1 before dosing. 
9. Section [IP_ADDRESS], Pregn ancy Testing  
Description of change:   Updated to indicate that urine pregnancy tests will be conducted 
on Day 1 of each cycle or as required by [CONTACT_427]. 
Rationale for change:  Text has been updated to match Table 16, Laboratory 
Assessments for Scr eening Through Treatment Phase. 
10. Section 7.5, Efficacy Assessments 
Description of change:   Section 7.5.1 was updated to indicate that brain MRI at baseline 
should also be considered when disease burden due to any targeted tumor types is 
extensive (ie, when ≥ 3 metastatic disease sites are involved) , and that for selection of 
target lesions, RECIST v1.1, Cheson, or RANO criteria should be followed.  In Section 7.5.3, a table of guidelines for imaging and treatment after first radiographic 
evidence of disease progression was added. 
Rationale for change:  Guidance for consideration of baseline brain MRIs has been added, and guidance for imaging and treatment after first evidence of progressive disease 
has been added.  
11. Section 7.8, Tumor Biopsy Collection and Analysis 
Description of change:   The number of required archival unstained slides has been 
updated to 20 to 25 slides (instead of 15 to 25). 
Rationale for change:  Based on current sample analyses plan , 20 to 25 slides would be 
needed to complete all plann ed testing.

Rationale:   The inclusion criteria for subjects with NSCLC, melanoma, CRC, SCCHN, 
and B cell NHL or HL have been updated to clarify patient population and prior therapy 
requirements.  
5. Synopsis, Key Exclusion Criteria; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria #1e and 22 
Description:   Exclusions for alkaline phosphatase values and QTc requirements for 
subjects with pacemakers have been updated.  
Rationale:   These exclusion criteria have been updated to clarify requirements for  
alkaline phosphatase in the context of bone metastases and QTc requirements for subjects 
with pacemakers.  
6. Synopsis, Phase 1 Dose Escalation; Section 4.1.1, Phase 1 Dose Escalation 
Description:  The 300 mg BID dose cohort was clarified as an optional dose level that 
may be tested in parallel to opening the expansion cohorts.   
Rationale:   To provide to option to further escalate INCB024360 if a lower dose is 
selected as the PAD.  
7. Section 5. 5.1, Definition of Dose- Limiting Toxicities (Table 3, Criteria for Defining 
Dose-Limiting Toxicities); Section 5.6.2, Criteria and Procedures Interruption 
(Table 4, Dose Modification Guidelines for Drug -Related Adverse Events)  
Description:   Clarification has been added to the DLT criteria for the Grade 3 rash to 
specify steroid use means systemic steroids.  
Rationale:   Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_165867] a 
DLT. 
8. Section 5.11, Restricted Medications and Measures  
Descriptio n:  Updated guidance was added for use of coumarin- based anticoagulants.  
Rationale:   A study was conducted (Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-102) that investigated the 
potential drug-drug interaction between INCB024360 and warfarin.  Results from the 
preliminary PK and PD analyses concluded that multiple dosing of INCB024360 300 mg 
BID increased S -warfarin and R warfarin geomean plasma AUCs by 43% and 68%, 
respectively, accompanied by [CONTACT_165968].  
Modeling showed that, with the same degree of warfarin PK interaction, the magnitude of 
INR increase may be significantly greater in patients on stable warfarin regimen targeting a typi[INVESTIGATOR_165868] 2 to 3 (which is higher than the INR observed in this study 
following a single warfar in dose).  Therefore, we recommend an approximate one-third 
reduction of warfarin dose for subjects who also receive INCB024360, along with close 
INR monitoring.  No clinically relevant interaction was observed on INCB024360 PK 
with concomitant warfarin.

Description:   Text has been added to clarify LFT monitoring requirements for subjects 
with persistent low -grade abnormalities. 
Rationale:   Liver function test monitoring for persistent low -grade abnormalities does 
not need to be monitored twice a week indefinitely.  Appropriate LFT monitoring 
intervals should be dis cussed with the medical monitor for these circumstances.

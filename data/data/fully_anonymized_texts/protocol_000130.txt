TITLE:  Open-Label Extension, Phase 2b Study to Evaluate the Longer Term Efficacy and Safety 
of LIB003 in Patients on Stable Lipid-Lowering Therapy Requiring Additional LDL-C Reduction  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:   LIB003-[ADDRESS_310453]:   LIB003 
PHASE:  2b 
INDICATION(S):  Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C) reduction in patients with 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), high risk of ASCVD, or heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) without cardiovascular disease who need additional LDL- C 
reduction 
OBJECTIVES: 
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the longer term safety, tolerability, and 
LDL-C-lowering efficacy after 52 weeks  of additional treatment with LIB003 at a subcutaneous 
(SC) dose of 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). Study patients will be those with 
hypercholesterolemia on stable diet and oral LDL-C-lowering drug therapy who have comp leted 
the Phase 2 dose finding study.  
The secondary objectives of this study are the following: 
 To assess the longer term tolerability and safety of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated 
for an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg , and 
350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study;   
 To assess the stability of LDL-C-lowering with LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for 
an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 
350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect on serum unbound (free) proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) concentrations of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for 
an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg , and 
350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the effects on serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], including total cholesterol (TC), high- density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C), non–HDL-C, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C ), and 
triglycerides (TG) of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who 
were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo during the 
Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the effects on apolipoprotein (apo) B and lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) serum 
concentrations of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who 
were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo during the 
Phase 2 double-blind study;

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 5 To assess the pharmacokinetics of LIB003 and PCSK9 following multiple doses of LIB003  
300 mg SC Q4W;   
 To assess the frequency of anti-drug (anti-LIB003) antibodies (ADAs) (immunogenicity) of 
LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who were previously 
treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo, including those w ith 
detectable ADAs during the Phase 2 double-blind study; and   
 Patients who develop neu tralizing antibodies at Week [ADDRESS_310454] dose, if NAbs continue 
positive with possible attenuation of free PCSK9 and LDL-C, then up to 2 additional doses 
could be administered. 
POPULATION: 
The population for this study includes men and women who are 18 years of age who completed 
the double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week Phase 2 study (LIB003-002) and will continue on 
stable lipid-lowering oral drug therapy (eg, tolerable statin with or without ezetimibe). 
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: 
This is an open-label, Phase 2b extension study of 52 weeks duration. Approximately 35 men and 
women aged [ADDRESS_310455] completed the Phase 2 (LIB003-002) study and fulfill the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled at up to 4 sites in the [LOCATION_002]. All patients 
will receive LIB003 at a dose of 300 mg administered SC Q4W.

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 15 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in 
industrialized countries and, despi[INVESTIGATOR_255583], is projected to cause >22 million deaths 
over the next 15 years.1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been identified as one 
of the major, and easily modifiable, risk factors for atherosclerosis.2 Significant ASCVD benefit 
has been achieved since the introduction of statin therapy to reduce LDL-C.2 However, significant 
unmet medical need remains for additional LDL-C reduction in patients with existing ASCVD and 
those at increased cardiovascular risk, including patients unable to tolerate statins or effective 
doses of statins and those with more severe elevations of LDL-C, such as those with familial 
hypercholesterolemia (FH).3 Data from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration has 
provided evidence that for every 1 mmol/L (~39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C, the risk of major 
cardiovascular events is reduced by 24%, although these data were collected mostly with statins.2 
The recent cardiovascular outcome study with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 
(PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and evolocumab (Repatha®) and alirocumab (Praluent®) 
studies, the FOURIER and ODYSSEY Outcome studies, respectively, have confirmed this 
relationship for non–statin-lowering of LDL-C.4,[ADDRESS_310469] hoc analysis of the IMPROVE-IT and Phase 3 alirocumab (Praluent®) 
studies, plus the FOURIER and SPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] (Cardiovascular Efficacy and Safety of Bococizumab in 
High-Risk Patients) studies, have shown that the relationship between absolute LDL-C reduction 
and ASCVD event reduction remains linear and extends to very low LDL-C levels of <15 mg/dL 
without signals of adverse events either from PCSK9 inhibition or very low LDL-C.6,7,8,9,10,11 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 is a circulating protein secreted mainly by [CONTACT_255606] a significant role in the recycling of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) 
and has been identified as a validated drug target for reduction of LDL-C. The LDLR is the primary 
pathway for LDL-C elimination from circulation; plasma PCSK9 binds to the hepatic LDLR along 
with LDL-C, targeting the receptor for degradation after endocytosis and thus reducing the 
expression of LDLRs available to remove LDL-C from circulation. Gain-of-function mutations of 
PCSK9 are associated with elevated LDL-C and constitute a third cause of FH and accelerated 
ASCVD, while loss-of-function mutations of PCSK9 are associated with reduced levels of LDL-C 
and reductions in ASCVD.4,5,11,[ADDRESS_310470] not been 
observed in subjects carrying loss-of-function PCSK9 mutations, even in a compound 
heterozygote with no detectable PCSK9 levels and strikingly low LDL-C (14 mg/dL), although 
recent Mendelian randomization studies have suggested the potential for increased diabetes in 
patients with impaired glucose tolerance or metabolic syndrome similar to that seen with 
statins.5,13,14 Nonclinical studies in PCSK9 knockout or overexpressing mice revealed phenotypes 
consistent with the human clinical data.15 Together, the clinical and nonclinical data for the PCSK9 
mechanism of action provide a strong genetic proof of concept for targeting PCSK9 to reduce 
plasma LDL-C levels and lower the risk of coronary heart disease. Based on these observations, 
PCSK9 inhibition is a promising target for developi[INVESTIGATOR_255584]-mAb therapi[INVESTIGATOR_255585]. 
LIB Therapeutics has developed LIB003, a Chinese hamster ovary-cell line-derived recombinant 
fusion protein therapeutic agent consisting of a PCSK9-binding domain and human serum albumin 
(HSA). The HSA contains an alanine substituted for the naturally occurring cysteine at residue 34. 
The PCSK9-binding domain (Adnectin) in LIB003 is derived from the 10th type III domain of 
human fibronectin modified by [CONTACT_255607], LLC

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_310471] subcutaneous (SC) therapy 
for the reduction of LDL-C in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH (HeFH), ASCVD, 
or high risk of ASCVD who require additional LDL-C reduction. 
Based on in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating that LIB003 was unable to bind rodent PCSK9 
with sufficient affinity to modulate pharmacology in wild type rodents, no rodent toxicity studies 
were performed in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guideline S6.16,17,18 To assess the overall toxicity risk of exposing human subjects to LIB003, 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 4-week repeat-dose and 12-week repeat-dose toxicity studies 
were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. These studies demonstrated that LIB003 was clinically 
well tolerated with no adverse findings at all doses tested (30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg SC doses; 
100 mg/kg intravenous [IV] dose [4-week study only]). The highest dose of 100 mg/kg was 
considered the no-observed-adverse-effect level in both studies.    
In this current study, as with now numerous studies with mAbs that inhibit PCSK9, inhibition with 
LIB003 is not expected to adversely impact the cardiovascular system since both PCSK9-null mice 
and compound heterozygous humans with PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations exhibit no 
discernable cardiovascular phenotype.19,20,[ADDRESS_310472] on cardiovascular, central nervous system, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806]. No 
genotoxicity studies were conducted with LIB003 as LIB003 is a fusion protein that does not 
contain an organic linker or any chemical moiety and, therefore, lacks potential for mutagenesis.  
Phase 1 study: 
LIB003 has been studied in a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) study of [ADDRESS_310473] 43 days. Subcutaneous doses of LIB003 
25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg were administered to healthy subjects on no 
lipid-lowering therapy who had baseline LDL-C 100 and 190 mg/dL, and the 150 mg and 
300 mg doses were administered to patients on stable statin therapy with baseline 
LDL-C 100 mg/dL.  
Safety: All subjects had TG 250 mg/dL. LIB003 was safe and well tolerated following single SC 
and IV dosing in healthy subjects at all doses both for SC and IV administration as well as in 
patients with hypercholesterolemia on statin therapy at 150 mg and 300 mg given SC. A summary 
of adverse events is provided in Table 1 and summarized below.

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 18 There were no other clinically remarkable vital sign measurements, physical examination findings, 
physical measurement findings, or clinically remarkable trends from baseline to discharge. 
There were no clinically remarkable trends observed in laboratory findings. A number of subjects 
in both LIB003 and placebo experienced spi[INVESTIGATOR_255587] (CK) that were clearly related 
to exercise or excessive or unusual physical activity, and CK decreased at subsequent testing. 
There were no adverse events based on ECG findings or any findings that were assessed as 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_737]. 
Anti-drug (anti-LIB003) antibodies (ADAs) were confirmed in 2 subjects: One subject treated with 
25 mg SC of LIB003 developed low titer non-neutralizing ADAs at Day 43; the titers remained 
low on monthly follow-up, with a stable titer of [ADDRESS_310480], treated 
with 600 mg IV of LIB003, developed an ADA response at Day 22, which increased to a titer of 
2560 by [CONTACT_2006] 43. The patient was followed at weekly intervals until Day 57 when LDL-C returned 
to within 20% of baseline and was followed at monthly intervals for 2.5 months after Day 43, 
reaching a maximal titer of 5120 at Day 113, which declined 50% on Day 142. There were no 
associated clinical or laboratory adverse effects noted and there did not appear to be any 
neutralizing impact on efficacy as LDL-C and free PCSK9 reduction did not appear attenuated 
compared to other subjects treated with LIB003 in the same cohort. Evaluation in the LIB003 
neutralizing antibody (NAb) assay indicated that these ADAs were neutralizing beginning on 
Day [ADDRESS_310481] 2018 (1 month after ending the study) to the Principal Investigator (PI), who was also 
the patient’s lipid doctor, the patient reported a recent upper right lung lobe mass found by [CONTACT_255608] 24 July 2018 and on biopsy taken 30 July 2018 diagnosed as 
Epstein-Barr positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma of intra thoracic lymph nodes. The finding 
was determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_255588]. 
Efficacy: Mean reductions in free PCSK9 were rapid with all doses and reached more than 
99% within [ADDRESS_310482] 3 weeks (Day 22) in 
the cohorts not on lipid-lowering therapy receiving 150 mg of LIB003. While the 300 mg dose 
maintained 99% suppression of free PCSK9 for 29 days in the 150 mg patients on 
non-lipid-lowering subjects, it had decreased to 12% and in those on statins to 54% of baseline 
levels. The reduced effects in free PCSK9 were reflected in less reductions of LDL-C and 
apolipoprotein (apo) B in statin-treated subjects although greater reductions were maintained in 
subjects not on lipid-lowering therapy. However, the [ADDRESS_310483] higher baseline PCSK9 levels and likely increased synthesis of 
PCSK9, will require 300 mg or higher doses in order to suppress both free PCSK9 and LDL-C 
fully for 4 weeks. Three doses were selected for the Phase 2 study to be administered SC every 
4 weeks (Q4W); 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg.

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 19 Phase 2 study: 
Based on the free PCSK9 and LDL-C data from the SAD study and an objective of obtaining 
maximal and stable LDL-C reductions with dosing at least Q4W in a volume that is consistent 
with a single SC injection via an autoinjector ( 1.5 mL), a 16-week Phase 2 study was done. This 
was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study in approximately 81 patients with 
ASCVD, or at high risk for ASCVD, or HeFH without cardiovascular disease, on stable maximal 
tolerable statin and/or ezetimibe which was completed on 09 November 2018. The doses assessed 
included 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg all administered SC Q4W on Days 1, 29, and 57 with the 
final efficacy endpoint at Day 85 (Week 12). Patients were monitored for 4 additional weeks at 
Days 99 and 113. Patients were randomized within each treatment group to LIB003 or placebo in 
a ratio of 3:1 resulting in 20 patients on placebo and 61 patients in the LIB003 treatment groups 
(21 on 150 mg, 19 on 300 mg, and 21 on 350 mg). Of the 81 patients randomized, 79 completed 
the study; of the [ADDRESS_310484] with her work schedule.  
Safety: There were no deaths and all 3 doses were safe and well tolerated (see Table 2). Serious 
adverse events occurred in 5.0% (1/20) subjects in the placebo group, 4.8% (1/21) in the LIB003 
150 mg group, 10.5% (2/19) in the LIB003 300 mg, and 9.5% (2/21) in the LIB003 [ADDRESS_310485] positive ADAs on screening, of which 19 were 
confirmed as positive. This included 2 patients (2.5%) who tested positive prior to receiving study 
drug and whom showed the highest titers (160 and 1280) and in both patients, titers decreased 
progressively after dosing with study drug. Excluding these [ADDRESS_310486]-dose in 27.8% (17/61) patients treated with LIB003 and 0% (0/20) on placebo. All 
positive ADAs post-dosing of study drug had low, or below level of quantitation, levels and based 
on individual free PCSK9 and LDL-C levels, there did not appear to be a pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) effect. Subsequent testing was negative for treatment-induced 
NAbs.

Efficacy: The co-primary endpoints of percent reduction in LDL-C (calculated by [CONTACT_255609]) from baseline compared to placebo at Week 12 and the mean of Weeks 10 and 12 was

and -76.1% (4.99; -86.0, -66.2) at mean of Weeks 10 and 12 (LOCF). These results were consistent 
with LDL-C measured by [CONTACT_255610]. The lower dose 
of [ADDRESS_310488] dose, was insufficient to 
provide consistent free PCSK9, and more importantly LDL-C, reductions for 4 weeks. The larger 
dose of 350 mg Q4W provided no additional LDL-C reduction at any time point.

Additional objectives of this study are the following: 
 To assess the frequency of anti-drug (anti-LIB003) antibodies (ADAs) (immunogenicity) of 
LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who were previously 
treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo, including those with 
detectable ADAs during the Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the longer term tolerability and safety of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated 
for an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 
350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study;   
 To assess the stability of LDL-C-lowering with LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for 
an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 
350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study;

Version 3.0, 18 March  2020 21  To assess the PD effect on serum unbound (free) PCSK9 concentrations of LIB003 300 mg 
Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with LIB003 
at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the effects on serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C), non–HDL-C, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and 
triglycerides (TG) of LIB003 300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who 
were previously treated with LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo during the 
Phase 2 double-blind study; 
 To assess the PK of LIB003 and PCSK9 following multiple doses of LIB003 300 mg SC Q4W; 
and 
 To assess the effects on apo B and lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) serum concentrations of LIB003 
300 mg Q4W in patients treated for an additional 52 weeks who were previously treated with 
LIB003 at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 350 mg or placebo during the Phase 2 double-blind study. 
In patients who are NAb positive at Week 52, the rationale for up to 3 additional doses of LIB003 
300mg QW4 (12 additional weeks of exposure) is to allow for the assessment of the time course 
of NAbs and effects on relevant clinical and laboratory measures including but not limited to free 
PCSK9 and LDL-C. 
The risk of continuing treatment for up to 12 additional weeks (64 weeks total exposure) is 
considered low.  Currently, 3 of 112 (approximately 2.7%) patients who have received LIB003 to 
date have developed NAbs. No patient has had a concurrent change in their clinical or laboratory 
safety or efficacy findings. The PCSK9 free and LDL-C lowering effects remained consistent to 
previous visits when there were no NAbs detected, negating any indication of a neutralizing 
clinical effect. In 2 prior patients, NAbs were detected and then resolved while the patient remained 
on LIB003 treatment or followed after completing treatment in the phase 1 single ascending dose 
trial.   
Safety, immunogenicity, and PD data derived from the study will further support the Phase 3 
studies. 
1.2 Risk/Benefit 
Patients will receive no known clinical benefit from participating in the study beyond that of an 
assessment of their overall health status and reduction in LDL-C.   
LIB003 at doses of 300 mg given were shown to reduce LDL-C levels >60% and was safe and 
well tolerated in the Phase 2 study these patients previously participated in. Therefore, the risk to 
patients in this study is considered low.

5.1 Treatment Group  
All patients will receive SC LIB003 at a dose of 300 mg Q4W.  
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
In the previous Phase 2 study (LIB003-002), the [ADDRESS_310502] is a 250 mg/mL solution packaged in 0.85 mL volumes in 2 mL clear glass vials 
with stoppers and aluminum crimp seals.  
The LIB003 formulation contains 20 mM histidine, 150 mM sodium chloride, 
0.02% Polysorbate 80 at pH 6.8, which are common excipi[INVESTIGATOR_255592].  
5.5.2 Study Drug Preparation and Dispensing 
LIB003 should be withdrawn directly from the vial into a suitable size syringe for injection. 
Solutions of LIB003 may foam; therefore, shaking and excessive agitation of vials should be 
avoided, or if performed, sufficient time allowed for the contents to settle prior to withdrawing the 
contents. Additionally, care must be taken to ensure the sterility of the prepared solution, as the 
drug product does not contain antimicrobial preservatives or bacteriostatic agents. To assure 
sterility of the prepared solutions, the vials are for single use only. 
Trained medical personnel will administer LIB003 to patients within the clinical facility. Site 
personnel should ensure that the study drug is stored in accordance with the environmental 
conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by [CONTACT_255616]. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study drug arise, do not 
dispense the study drug and contact [CONTACT_255617]. 
Instructions for LIB003 preparation are documented in a separate pharmacy manual.

and trained site staff in a secure location. Drug accountability records will be available for 
verification by [CONTACT_255619]. 
Storage and accountability information will be outlined in the separate pharmacy manual. 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Procedures 
5.6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures 
Concomitant therapy includes all medications and non-medication interventions used by a patient 
during the study.  
Medications include prescription drugs, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, approved dietary and 
herbal supplements, and nutritional supplements. Examples of non-medication interventions 
include individual psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, smoking cessation therapy, and 
rehabilitative therapy. All concomitant medications and non-medication interventions should be 
reported to the Investigator and recorded in the concomitant medications eCRF. 
As a general rule, concomitant medications will be permitted unless specifically excluded and 
provided they are anticipated to remain stable throughout the study or do not impact LDL-C. The 
rationale for use of any exceptions is to be discussed between the Investigator and the Sponsor and 
clearly documented. The following medications are exceptions: 
 Medications used to treat adverse events may be prescribed preferably after consultation with 
the Medical Monitor, unless there is an immediate medical need to ensure the well-being of 
the patient that should not be delayed. All therapy and/or medication administered to manage 
adverse events should be recorded in the appropriate eCRF.

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_310516] a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal 
product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or 
symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and 
documented from the time following the first dose of study drug until study participation is 
complete. Patients should be instructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the 
Investigator. From the time following the first dose of study drug, the Investigator should make an 
assessment for adverse events at each visit and record the event on the appropriate adverse event 
eCRF. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_76768]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF.  
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at the time of the first dose of study drug should not be 
reported as an adverse event unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline 
changes in nature or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it should be reported as 
an adverse event. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (eg, ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at the time of the first dose of study drug and significantly 
worsen during the study should be reported as adverse events. The Investigator will exercise his 
or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not 
require reporting as an adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal clinical findings 
(eg, ECG abnormalities) should be reported as an adverse event if any of the following are 
applicable: 
 If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality, 
 If action taken with the study drug is required as a result of the abnormality, or 
 Based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator. 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction 
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_310517] a reasonable possibility 
(ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out). 
8.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_248128] (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug 
using the categories of yes or no. 
Assessment of Severity: 
 Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily 
activities. 
 Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities. 
 Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily 
activities. 
Causality Assessment: 
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
 No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the administration of study 
drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and 
another cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is suspected. 
 Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence 
or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified. 
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from study drug administration – The event should occur after the study 
drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the 
clinical context of the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases – Each report should be evaluated in the context 
of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the patient 
may have. 
 Concomitant drug – The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives 
should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event 
in question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of study drug – Clinical and/or preclinical data may 
indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect.

changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug – The known pharmacologic properties 
(absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be considered.

8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening adverse event; 
o NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death. 
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97889]; 
o NOTE: Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186220] 1 overnight stay will be considered an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. An emergency room visit without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255594] a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent or elective treatment of a pre-existing 
condition that did not worsen from baseline. However, unexpected complications and/or 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255595]. Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239608] (ie, no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]) will 
not be considered inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 An important medical event. 
o NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the 
development of drug dependency.

during monitoring visits. The CRAs will verify data recorded in the EDC system with source 
documents. All corrections or changes made to any study data must be appropriately tracked in an 
audit trail in the EDC system. An eCRF will be considered complete when all missing, incorrect, 
and/or inconsistent data has been accounted for. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_310528] comply with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
(21 CFR Part 11) and other appropriate international regulations. All passwords will be strictly 
confidential. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_310529] be kept in 
the appropriate study files at the site. Source data is defined as all information in original records 
and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_34504], observations, or other activities in a 
clinical study necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical study. Source data are 
contained in source documents (original records or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]). These records will be retained 
in a secure file for the period as set forth in the Clinical Study Agreement. Prior to transfer or 
destruction of these records, the Sponsor must be notified in writing and be given the opportunity 
to further store such records.

Clinical Study Protocol LIB003-010 
Confidential & Proprietary 
Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_310530] of the Study 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for 
designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve human subjects. Compliance 
with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of study subjects 
are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, 
and that the clinical study data are credible. 
11.[ADDRESS_310531] (IRB) will review all appropriate study documentation in order to 
safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of patients. The study will only be conducted at sites 
where IRB approval has been obtained. The protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, informed consent 
form (ICF), advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the patients, safety 
updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB 
by [CONTACT_737]. 
Federal regulations and ICH require that approval be obtained from an IRB prior to participation 
of patients in research studies. Prior to study onset, the protocol, any protocol amendments, ICFs, 
advertisements to be used for patient recruitment, and any other written information regarding this 
study to be provided to a patient or patient’s legal guardian must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 
No drug will be released to the site for dosing until written IRB authorization has been received 
by [CONTACT_1034]. 
11.[ADDRESS_310532] ensure that the 
patient has been informed of his/her rights to privacy. The Investigator will obtain written informed 
consent from each patient before any study-specific activity is performed and should document in 
the source documentation that consent was obtained prior to enrollment in the study. The original 
signed copy of the ICF must be maintained by [CONTACT_255626] a 
representative of the Sponsor, their representatives, auditors, the IRB and/or regulatory agencies. 
A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the patient. 
11.4 Study Monitoring Requirements 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with 
the protocol, Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements, and that 
valid data are entered into the eCRFs. 
To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same time, the 
Sponsor in the maintenance of complete, legible, well organized and easily retrievable data. Before 
the enrollment of any patient in this study, the Sponsor or their designee will review with the 
Investigator and site personnel the following documents: protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, eCRFs 
LIB Therapeutics, LLC 
Clinical Study Protocol LIB003-010 
Confidential & Proprietary 
Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_310533] source 
documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data is entered 
by [CONTACT_779], the CRA will review the data for safety information, completeness, accuracy, and 
logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help 
monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to 
Investigators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor and 
provide any missing information, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigational site by [CONTACT_76775]-specific monitoring log. 
11.[ADDRESS_310534] parties 
other than those noted above is prohibited. 
11.6 Retention of Records 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator 
will keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link 
records, eg, eCRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed ICFs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_64349], SAE forms, 
source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. The records should be retained 
by [CONTACT_255627], local regulations, or as 
specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer. The Investigator must obtain 
written permission from the Sponsor before disposing of any records, even if retention 
requirements have been met. 
If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the Sponsor should 
be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, such 
as another Investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor.   
11.[ADDRESS_310535] consult with the Sponsor before any 
study data are submitted for publication. The Sponsor reserves the right to deny publication rights 
until mutual agreement on the content, format, interpretation of data in the manuscript, and journal 
selected for publication are achieved.

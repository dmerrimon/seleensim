Protocol Number:  4429 -301 
Protocol Title:  A Phase 3 Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Masked Study 
Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Emixustat Hydrochloride with 
Placebo for the Treatment of Macular Atrophy Secondary to Stargardt 
Disease  
Phase:  Phase 3 
Study Objectives  
Primary:  To determine if emixustat hydrochloride (emixustat) reduces the rate 
of progression of macular atrophy (MA) compared to placebo in 
subjects with Stargardt disease (STGD)  
 
 
Study Population:  Subjects who have MA secondary to STGD  

Acucela Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol 4429 -301, Amendment 3 21 May  2020 
Study Design:  This is a multicenter, randomized, double -masked, placebo -controlled 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of emixustat compared to 
placebo in subjects who have MA secondary to STGD.  Subjects will 
be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms in a  2:1 ratio.  
Treatment arms include:  
•Emixustat  10 mg
•Placebo
Subjects will take study drug once daily (QD) in the evening for 
24 continuous months.  
Subjects randomly assigned to the emixustat  arm will start taki ng a 
dose of 5  mg on Day 1 and step -up to 10 mg at the Month 1  visit, 
then maintain that dose for the  remainder of the dosing period, unless 
a dose reduction is taken.    
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Number of Subjects:  Approximately 189 subjects across multiple clinical sites will be 
enrolled in order to obtain approximately 159 evaluable subjects (106 
emixustat and 53 placebo) . 
Inclusion Criteria:  Subjects who meet al l of the following criteria at Screening and 
Baseline (unless otherwise indicated) may be eligible for inclusion in 
the study:  
1.Males or females, age ≥ [ADDRESS_873024] 1 or more pathogenic mutation(s) of the
ABCA4 (ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 4) gene.  If
only one ABCA4 pathogenic mutation  is identified or if two
ABCA4 pathogenic mutations that typi[INVESTIGATOR_650966] (ie, “in cis”) are identified, t he subject must have a typi[INVESTIGATOR_650967] (at least one eye has flecks at the level of the
retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_20092] [RPE] typi[INVESTIGATOR_650968])  and

Study Procedures:  The scheduled visits include Screening (wit hin 45 days prior to 
Baseline), Baseline (Day 1), and Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 
and 24.  The visits conducted at Months 9, 15, and [ADDRESS_873028] dose of study drug.  During the COVID-19 
crisis, visit windows are extended .

Termination visit where safety and efficac y assessments will be 
performe d when study drug is stopped, or as soon as possible after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743].  Subjects who discontinue fr om treatment will 
remain in the study , attending all clinical site visits through Month 
24. 
 
Criteria for  Evaluation 
Variables:  

Acucela Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol 4429 -301, Amendment 3 21 May  2020 
Efficacy  Efficacy variables will include total areas of the definitely decreased 
and questionably decreased autofluorescence MA lesion(s), total area 
of EZ loss, mean ONL thickness, extent  of abnormal near -infrared 
FAF, BCVA letter score, reading speed, contrast sensitivity, photopic 
microperimetry retinal  sensitivity, and QOL instrument s. 
Safety  Safety variables will include the incidence of ocular and non -ocular 
AEs, and the changes from baseline in BCVA  letter score , slit-lamp 
biomicroscopy  and dilated ophthalmoscopy  findings , IOP, spectral 
domain optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT)  and scotopic 
microperimetry  assessments , physical examination findings, vital 
signs, ECG  parameter s, and clinical laboratory tests. Pregnancy tests 
will be conducted in women of childbearing potential.  
An independent D ata Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the 
safety aspects of the study and periodically review safety summaries 
prepared by [CONTACT_650979].    
Study Endpoints:  
Primary Efficacy  The primary efficacy endpoint will be the mean rate of change from 
baseline in the total area of the MA lesion(s) in the study eye (in mm2 
per year) , defined as the area of definitely decreased autofluorescence  
as imaged by [CONTACT_332872] -illuminance FAF.  

Acucela Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol 4429 -301, Amendment 3 21 May  2020 
 
  
Statistical Analyses:  The sample size is determined based on the primary efficacy 
endpoint, the mean rate of change from baseline in area of DDAF in 
the study eye.  Approximately 189 subjects will be enrolled in order 
to obtain approximately 159 evaluable subjects (106 emixustat and 53 
placebo) .  This sample size will provide approximately 90% power to 
detect a difference in means between treatment arms of 0.50  mm2 per 
year (1.00  mm2/year for placebo vs. 0.50  mm2/year for emixustat ), or 
a 50% improvement with emixustat over placebo.  These estimates 
are based on using a Student’s t -test and assuming a common 
standard deviation of 0.[ADDRESS_873029] of emixustat 
compared to placebo.  Efficacy analyses will be performed on the 
intent -to-treat (ITT) and efficacy evaluable (EE) sets of subjects.  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed on the basis of ocular and 
non-ocular AEs, serious adverse events, ophthalmic examination 
findings, vital signs, physical examination findings, ECG findings, 
and laboratory analyses.  Safety assessments  will be summarized 
descriptively.  
Study Duration:  The protocol calls for  up to 45 days between initial Screening and 
Baseline (Day 1), a [ADDRESS_873030] the study drug dose; this yields a total duration of up to  
27 months.  During the COVID -19 crisis, the window for screening is 
extended to up to 59 days, the window for the Month 24 visit is 
extended by 42 days, and the window for follow -up (Study Exit visit)  

Acucela Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol 4429 -301, Amendment 3 21 May  2020 
is extended by 42 days to 102 days;  this yields a total duration of 
up to approximately 31 months.

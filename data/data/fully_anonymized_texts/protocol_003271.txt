Primary 
Statistical 
Hypothesis  A literature search of preoperative biliary drainage with self -expanding 
metal stents in patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer yielded 
eight articles with 305 patients.1-8 
A meta -analysis of the probability for pre -operative, operative and peri -
operative complications was performed.    A rate of 24.2% [95% CI: 13.2%, 
                                                                                                               Confidential

 37.2%] was calculated using th e eight  articles.  
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the  rate of complications 
for the Pre-Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  group is non -inferior 
to the No Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage  group.  The null hypothesis is 
that the complication rate is inferior in the Pre-Operative Biliary Drainage 
with SEMS  versus the No Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage  group : 
𝐻𝑜: 𝜋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡−𝜋𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙  ≥∆  (Inferior)  
 
𝐻𝑎: 𝜋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡−𝜋𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙  <∆  (Non -inferior)  
 
where 𝜋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡  and 𝜋𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 are the probabilities of having pre-operative, 
operative and peri -operative complications in the Pre-Operative Biliary 
Drainage with SEMS  arm and No Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage  arm 
respectively, and ∆ is defined as the non -inferiority margin.  
 
The s ample size was calculated for a one -sided 0.[ADDRESS_376803] 9® . If the P value from the exact Farrington -
Manning test is <0.05 then the Pre-Operative Biliary Drainage with 
SEMS  group will be considered non -inferior to the No Pre -Operative 
Biliary Drainage  group. The expected  probability of complications in the  
Pre-Oper ative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  arm and No Pre -Operative 
Biliary Drainage  arm is 37.2%, which was taken from the upper limit of 
the 95% CI from the meta -analysis described above and from the only 
available Level 1 study comparing no drainage to preoperati ve stenting in 
which the complication rate was reported to be 39% in the no drainage 
arm.9 The non -inferiority margin ( ∆) is 15%.  Given these assumptions 
and a one -sided 5% significance level, 2 x 132 = 264 subjects will 
provide 80 % power to reject the nu ll hypothesis , that the Pre-Operative 
Biliary Drainage with SEMS  group is inferior to the No Pre -Operative 
Biliary Drainage  group.  
To compensate for possible loss of subjects after enrollment and complete 
assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria, an add itional 10% of subjects 
will be enrolled, for a total of 2 x 147 = [ADDRESS_376804] Protoc ol

 1. Introduction  
1.1. Pancreatic and Periampullary cancer  
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the US and worldwide  with 
217,000 new cases/year and 213,000 deaths worldwide .10, 11    Relative 1 -year and 5 -year 
survival rates are 26% and 6% respectively.[ADDRESS_376816] .18  Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can be used complementary to CT  to 
provide add itional vascular invasion information or to evaluate periampullary masses .19, 20 
Although histologic diagnosis is not necessary before surgical treatment, a biopsy can be 
taken using fine -needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_307951] -guidance (preferred) or CT -guidanc e.18    
Diagnostic staging laparoscopy is also utilized, and is mostly valuable when there is a need to 
rule out sub -radiologic metastases (especially for body and tail lesions) .21, 22  
Based on results from imaging studies described above, p atients with pancrea tic cancer can 
be divided into four  prognostic subgroups  (Stages I-IV) to allow for choi ce of proper 
treatment course .  These groups are based on local tumor resectability status and presence or 
absence of distant disease  as defined by [CONTACT_307964] r-node -metastasis (TNM) staging system of 
the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) .23 Patients in whom the primary tumor 
can be removed are classified as localized  resectable ( Stages I and II ), and patients whose 
tumors are unresectable are classifie d as locally advanced (Stage  III) and metastatic (Stage 
IV).24 
Criteria for resectability vary but usually include the absence of distant metastases and no 
tumor inv olvement of major arteries; in cases of venous invasion  of the tumor , there must be 
a suitable segment of portal vein (above) and superior mesenteric vein (below) the site of 
venous involvement to allow for venous reconstruction .25  
1.2. Treatment of Pancreatic /Periampullary  Cancer  
The only potential curative treatment option for patients with resectable 
pancreatic/periampullary cancers is curative -intent -surgery (CIS) by 
[CONTACT_307965] (Whipple procedure)26 with a long -term survival rate of 20% and a 
median survival of 12 -20 months.24 Only 15 -20% of patients presenting with pancreatic 
cancer have potentially resectable tumors.[ADDRESS_376817] Protoc ol  
90914721 /Ver AD 
  Page [ADDRESS_376818] cells24 and 
accounting for over 90% of pancreatic m alignancies .12 
1.3. Biliary Drainage in Patients with Pancreatic /Periampullary  Cancer  
Biliary obstruction associated with  pancreatic/periampullary cancer occurs in up to 70% of 
patients .[ADDRESS_376819] been shown to be superior to plastic stents for 
preoperative biliary drainage in pancreatic cancer1 because of longer patency achieved by a 
greater stent diameter ,31 fewer ERCP procedures, and fewer epi[INVESTIGATOR_307952] s/cholestasis due to stent occlusion while awaiting surgery (15% using SEMS vs 
93% using  plastic stents ).[ADDRESS_376820] -market  (on label) , prospective, multi -center, randomized, non -blinded study.   
Patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_376821] -surgery follow up visit.  
There will be up to 20 participating centers world -wide with anticipated enrollment of 294 
patients, 147 per group.    
At each investigational center, there will be one principal investigator (PI) and at least one 
Co-PI.  At a minimum, there will be one gastroenterologic endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_307953].  Al though more than two investigators 
per center are allowed, it is encouraged that the number be kept small.

 3.2. Treatment Assignment  
Patients will be randomized at baseline in equal proportions of 1:1 ratio between Group 1 and 
Group 2 as follows:  
• Group 1 : No pre-operative biliary drainage (patients will not receive a stent)  
• Group 2 : Pre-operative biliary drainage with a SEMS  
Block randomization through an online database system will be used.  Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_91294].

Stent placement should be such that the proximal end of the stent is minimum [ADDRESS_376833] a stent will 
be made.  If a stent placement is not possible due to non -device related reasons (such as 
inability to cannulate the CBD or reach the papi[INVESTIGATOR_9387], extensive tumor growth at site of papi[INVESTIGATOR_9387], 
etc.),  interventional radiologic (IR) access is allowed and, where possible, should be 
associated with placement of a study stent over a transhepatically inserted guide -wire in a 
"rendez -vous" procedure.  Percutaneous trans hepatic cholangiograpy (PTC) and a subsequent 
internal drainage with a stent placement may be done at the same time (one -stage procedure), 
or PTC with external drainage  may be performed 2 -3 days before stent insertion (two -stage 
procedure) per standard of  practice.  If access to the biliary tree or endoscopic placement of 
the study stent through a “rendez -vous” procedure fails and patient requires percutaneous 
transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), then the patient will exit the study.

 7.2. Screening   
• Informed Consent  
• Eligibility Criteria Assessment   
No study -specific testing will be conducted until the subject has signed the study specific  
informed consent form ( ICF).  
Informed consent must be obtained for all subjects who are potential study candidates. 
Subjects will be asked to sign the ICF before any study -specific tests or procedures are 
performed. The ICF is study -specific and must be approved by [CONTACT_1636] (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) at each center. Study personnel should explain that even 
if a subject agrees to pa rticipate in the study and signs  the study specific  ICF, the screening 
process may demonstrate that the subject is not a suitable candidate for the study.

8. Statistical Considerations  
8.1. Hypothesi s 
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the  rate of complications for the Pre-
Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  group is non -inferior to the No Pre -Operative Biliary 
Drainage group. The null hypothesis is that the complication rate is inferior in the Pre -
Operative Bi liary Drainage with SEMS versus the No Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage group:  
 
Ho: πtest−πcontrol  ≥∆  (Inferior)  
                                                                                                                 Confidential  
20-Oct-[ADDRESS_376846] Protocol  
90914721 /Ver AD 
  Page 25 of 44 
  
Ha: πtest−πcontrol  <∆  (Non -inferior)  
 
where πtest  and πcontrol  are the probabilities of having pre -operative, operative and peri -
operative co mplications in the Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS arm and No Pre -
Operative Biliary Drainage arm respectively, and ∆ is defined as the non -inferiority margin.  
8.2. Sample Size  
A literature search of preoperative biliary drainage with self -expanding me tal stents in 
patients with pancreatic or periampullary  cancer yielded [ADDRESS_376847]-
operative complications was done:  
• A rate of 24.2% [95% CI: 13.2%, 37.2%] was calculated using the [ADDRESS_376848] 9®. If the P value from the exact Farrington -Manning test is <0.05 then the Pre-
Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  group will be considered non -inferior to the No Pre -
Operative Biliary Drainage  group. The expected  probability of complications in the  Pre-
Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  arm and No Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage  arm is 
37.2%, which was taken from the upper limit of the 95% CI from the meta -analysis described 
above and from the  only available Level 1 study comparing no drainage to preoperative 
stenting in which the complication rate was reported to be 39% in the no drainage arm.9 The 
non-inferiority margin ( ∆) is 15%.  Given these assumptions and a one -sided 5% significance 
level, 2 x 132 = 264 subjects will provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis, that the 
Pre-Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  group is inferior to the No Pre -Operative Biliary 
Drainage  group.  
To compensate for possible loss of subjects after enrollmen t and complete assessment of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, an additional 10% of subjects will be enrolled, for a total of 2 x 
147 = [ADDRESS_376849] is considered “enrolled” after signing the study -specific ICF.  Subjects who sign 
the ICF but subsequently do not meet one or more of the eligibility  criteria provided in 
Section  5.2 and Section 5.3  will be considered screen failures and excluded from the study.  
8.3.2.  Intent -to-Treat Cohort  
This cohort consists of those “en rolled” subjects who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and are subsequently randomized.  
                                                                                                                 Confidential

90914721 /Ver AD 
  Page 26 of 44 
 8.3.3.  Per-Protocol Cohort  
The per -protocol cohort is a subset of the ITT subjects who are treated per protocol after 
randomization (Group 1 no stent, and Group 2 receive d a study stent)  and no major protocol 
deviations (ICH E9 definitions) . 
8.4. Data Analyses  
All statistical analyses will be done using The SAS System software, version 8 or higher 
(Copyright © [ADDRESS_376851], Cary, North Carolina [ZIP_CODE], 
[LOCATION_003]. All rights reserved).  
The distribution of prognostic factors between patients  with and without data will be 
examined. Statistical models that account for censored data will be employed in appropriate 
circumstances, e.g. for time -to-event outcomes. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to 
assess the impact of missing data  on the interpretation of the results , e.g. a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_30350].  
 
8.4.1.  Baseline Data  
Baseline data will be summarized.  Subject  demographics, clinical history, risk factors, LFTs, 
tumor diagnosis, and obstruction symptoms  will be summarized using descriptive statis tics 
(e.g., mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum) for continuous variables and 
frequency statistics for discrete variables.  
  
8.4.2.  Post-Procedure Endpoints  
Post-procedure information will be collected at regularly scheduled follow -up examinations 
as detailed in the clinical study event schedule and will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics for continuous variables (e.g., mean, standard deviation, n, min imum, maximum) 
and frequency tables or proportions for discrete variables.  
8.4.3.  Subgroup Analyses  
The subgroup analyses will include tabulating  the primary endpoint and select secondary 
endpoints by [CONTACT_547].  
8.4.4.  Justification of Pooling  
The analyses will be presen ted using pooled data across institutions. An analysis of the 
poolability will be made using logistic regression for binary outcomes, analysis of covariance 
for continuous outcomes, or proportional hazards regression for time -to-event outcomes, to 
assess d ifferences between study institutions and to justify pooling data across institutions.  
                                                                                                                 Confidential

  Page 27 of 44 
 8.4.5.  Multivariable Analyses  
Univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed to assess possible predictors of the 
primary endpoint. Possible predictors may include any but not limited to 
demographic/baseline data and medical history data. Factors from the univariate model with 
p≤0.20 will also be modeled multivariately using a stepwise procedure in a generalized linear  
model  or Cox Proportional Hazards model . The significance thresholds for entry and exit into 
the model will be set to p<0.10.  
8.4.6.  Changes to Planned Analyses  
Any chan ges to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the analyses  will be 
documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan approved prior to performing the analyses.

associated with stent removal during an ERCP procedure include, but are not limited to:  
• Pain 
• Bleeding  
• Fever  
• Nausea  
• Vomiting

• Myocardial infarction   
• Mortality   
9.4. Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, 
performing procedures in the appropriate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84365], adherence to subject 
selection criteria, close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research 
procedures and/or follow -ups and b y promptly supplying BSC with all pertinent information 
required by [CONTACT_3181].   The latter may facilitate inter -center communications regarding 
serious AEs.  
9.5. Anticipated Benefits  
Subjects may not receive any benefit from participating in this study but this study may 
provide a future benefit to medical science and other patients.   To date there is no broadly 
accepted standard of practice pertaining to pre -operative drainage of patients as defined by 
[CONTACT_307968].  
9.6. Risk to Benefit Rationale  
Based on prior BSC’s clinical studies and collected reports in literature to -date, the risk -to-
benefit ratio is within reason for fors eeable risks. However, literature reports do not always 
capture all side effects. Observation and fo llow up of subjects is required as outlined in the 
protocol.

Underlying diseases are not reported as AEs unless there is an increase in severity or 
frequency during the course of the investigation. Death should not be recorded as an AE, but 
should only be reflected as an outcome of a specific SAE (see Table 10.1-1 for AE 
definitions).  
Any AE experienced by [CONTACT_307969], whether during or 
subsequent to the procedure, must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Refer to Section 9 for the known risks associated with the study device(s).  
Adverse e vents that occur during the course of the study will be evaluated against a list of 
pre-specified complication criteria as defined in Section 12.14.  Determination of whether an 
AE meets the definition of a pre-specified complication wi ll be made by [CONTACT_67926].  
10.2. Relationship to Study Device(s)  
The Investigator must assess the relationship of the AE to the study device as related or 
unrelated. See criteria in Table 10.2-2:  
Table 10.2-2: Criteria for Assessing Relationship of Study Device to Adverse Event  
Classification  Description  
Unrelated  The adverse event is determined to be due to a concurrent illness or 
effect of another device/drug and is not related to the investigational 
product.  
Related  • The adverse event is determined to be potentially related to the 
investigational product, and an alternative etiology is equally or less 
likely compared to the potential relationship to investigational 
product.

12.1. Data Management  
12.1.1.   Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
Subject data will be recorded  in a limited access  secure electronic data capture (EDC) 
system.   
The clinical database will reside on a production server. All changes made to the clinical data 
will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review by [CONTACT_307973] ( BSC ) or its representative. The associated software and database have been 
designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system 
compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studies  pertaining to 
the use of electronic records and signatures. Database b ackups are performed regularly.  
The Investigator provide s his/her electronic signature [CONTACT_307985] (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature [CONTACT_307986] [CONTACT_1295]. Changes to data 
previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_307974].  
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data 
discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC system and will 
be issued to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all 
queries in the database.  
                                                                                                                 Confidential

related to protection of subjects.  Investigators, associated IRBs/ECs, and regulatory 
authorities, as applicable, will be notified in writing in the event of study termination.  
12.12.2.    Criteria for Premature Termination of the Study  
Possible reasons for premature study termination incl ude, but are not limited to, the 
following.  
• The occurrence of unanticipated adverse device effects that present a significant or 
unreasonable risk to subjects enrolled in the study.  
• An enrollment rate far below expectation that prejudices the conclusion of  the study.  
• A decision on the part of [LOCATION_011] Scientific to suspend or discontinue development of the 
device.  
12.12.3.    Termination of Study Participation  by [CONTACT_5717]/ 
EC Approval  
Any investigator, or IRB/ EC in the Preoperative Biliar y Drainage RCT  Study may 
discontinue participation in the study or withdrawal approval of the study, respectively, with 
suitable written notice to [LOCATION_011] Scientific. Investigators, associated IRBs/ECs, and 
regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be not ified in writing in the event of these 
occurrences.  
12.12.4.    Requirements for Documentation and Subject Follow -up 
In the event of premature study termination a written statement as to why the premature 
termination has occurred will be provided to all participatin g centers by [CONTACT_5756]. 
The IRB/EC and regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be notified. Detailed information 
on how enrolled subjects will be managed thereafter will be provided.  
In the event an IRB or EC terminates participation in the st udy, participating investigators, 
associated IRBs/ECs, and regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be notified in writing. 
                                                                                                                 Confidential

 Detailed information on how enrolled subjects will be managed thereafter will be provided 
by [CONTACT_5756].  
In the event an i nvestigator terminates participation in the study, study responsibility will be 
transferred to a co -investigator, if possible. In the event there are no opportunities to transfer 
investigator responsibility; detailed information on how enrolled subjects wi ll be managed 
thereafter will be provided by [CONTACT_5756].  
The investigator must return all documents and investigational product to [LOCATION_011] Scientific, 
unless this action would jeopardize the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects.  
12.12.5.    Criteria for Suspending/Terminating a Study Center  
[LOCATION_011] Scientific Corporation  reserves the right to stop the inclusion of subjects at a study 
center at any time after the study initiation visit if no subjects have been enrolled for a period 
beyond  2 months after cen ter initiation, or if the center has multiple or  severe protocol 
violations/nonc ompliance without justification and/or fails to follow remedial actions.  
In the event of termination of investigator participation, all study devices and testing 
equipment , as applicable,  will be returned to BSC  unless this action would jeopardize the 
rights, safety or well -being of the subjects . The IRB/EC and regulatory authorities, as 
applicable, should be notified. All subjects  enrolled in the study  at the center will continue to 
be followed per protocol.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_307960] -up visits unless BSC  notifies the investigational center otherwise . 
12.13.  Publication Policy  
In accordance with the Corporate Policy on the Conduct of Human Subject Research, BSC 
requires disclosure of its involvement as a sponsor or financial supporter in any publication 
or presentation relating to a BSC study or its results. In accordance with the Corporate Policy 
for the Condu ct of Human Subject Research, BSC will submit study results for publication 
(regardless of study outcome) following the conclusion or termination of the study. [LOCATION_011]

Specific PBD (ERCP, PTC) related : 
o Acute pancreatitis   Abdominal pain and a serum concentration of pancreatic 
enzymes (amylase or lipase) three or  more times the upper limit of normal, that 
required more than one night of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]

 Confidential PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS
TITLE A Randomized Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Enzastaurin Plus R-CHOP Versus R-CHOP in Treatment-Naïve Subjects 
with High-Risk Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Who Possess the Novel 
Genomic Biomarker DGM1 (ENGINE Study) 
SPONSOR Denovo Biopharma LLC 
RATIONALE Non-thmost common cancer in the 
[LOCATION_002] with 72,580 new cases predicted to occur in 2016 (SEER 
database). Approximately 20,150 people were predicted to die from this 
disease in 2016. Of these, slightly more than half, approximately 11,450 
will be male, and 8,690 will be female. There are over a half million 
people with NHL living in this country. Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma 
(DLBCL) is the most common of the NHLs, accounting for between 
30%-40% of all cases. The incidence of DLBCL generally increases with 
age and roughly half of all patients are over the age of 60 at the time of 
diagnosis ( Lymphoma Research Foundation, 2018 ).
DLBCL is classified as an aggressive lymphoma meaning that its clinical 
course can progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_824093]. Nevertheless, patients with DLBCL 
can be cured with the appropriate treatment. The current standard of care 
treatment for DLBCL consists of rituximab added to the anthracycline-
containing combination chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (NCCN Treatment Guidelines). 
This regimen is referred to as R-CHOP immunochemotherapy. For 
DLBCL as a whole, R-CHOP immunochemotherapy has resulted in cure 
rates of approximately 60%. However, for individual patients 5-year 
survival rates can range from 90% for low-risk DLBCL patients to less 
than 50% for high-risk DLBCL patients ( Sehn et al., 2015 , Zhou et al., 
2014). 
Most important, for those subjects refractory to R-CHOP therapy less 
than 10% achieve a durable remission with secondary therapy ( Sehn et 
al., 2015). Thus, while R-CHOP remains the standard treatment for high-
risk, advanced stage DLBCL, approximately 30-40% patients fail front-
line therapy with most not achieving complete response or with early 
relapse. An essential step to move forward and improve the outcomes of 
these patients is to increase the rate of complete response to front-line R-
CHOP therapy ( Chiapella et al., 2016 ). 
For this reason, there has been a great deal of effort placed on attempting 
to define disease characteristics that predispose patients to a poorer 
prognosis with R-CHOP therapy. Molecular and gene expression 
profiling of tumors and a variety of clinical prognostic indices have been 
used to identify patients at higher risk of failing R-CHOP 
immunochemotherapy. While this work has identified subgroups of 
patients who do not respond well to R-CHOP, to date these efforts have 
not resulted in substantial gains in response to front-line therapy. 
Denovo Biopharma (Denovo) has pi[INVESTIGATOR_824094]. Denovo has developed a model that employs 
sophisticated pharmacogenomic testing to detect somatic biomarkers that 
identify those subjects who responded to a particular study treatment with 
Denovo Biopharma LLC  Enzastaurin 
DB102-[ADDRESS_1142809], in this case enzastaurin, in an 
enriched population. 
Applying this technology to archived DNA samples from completed 
studies of enzastaurin in subjects with DLBCL, Denovo has identified a 
somatic biomarker that reliably identified subjects for whom the study 
treatment significantly prolonged survival. Enzastaurin is an oral 
serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, that targets the protein kinase C (PKC), 
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT pathways to inhibit 
tumor cell proliferation, induce tumor cell apoptosis, and suppress tumor-
induced angiogenesis. 
The purpose of the current study is to prospectively assess the effect on 
overall survival (OS) of adding enzastaurin to R-CHOP 
immunochemotherapy in the front-line treatment of subjects with high-
risk DLBCL (IPI  3). The detailed rationale for this study is provided in 
greater depth in Section 1.5 . 
STUDY DESIGN This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study intends 
to enroll approximately 235 treatment-naïve subjects with high-risk 
DLBCL. These subjects will be randomized 1:1 to R-CHOP plus 
enzastaurin or R-CHOP plus placebo. All subjects will receive up to 6 
cycles (1 cycle = 21 days) of treatment during combination phase. PET-
CT will be used for staging and to assess radiographic response at the end 
combination phase tumor response assessment. Subjects randomized to 
the enzastaurin arm who have a complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) (at 
(Cheson 2014 ) will have the opportunity to continue in the single-agent 
phase of the study and receive single-agent enzastaurin for up to [ADDRESS_1142810] of care (SOC) 
versus R-CHOP followed by [CONTACT_824115]-naïve subjects with 
high-risk DLBCL who possess the DGM1 biomarker. 
SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVES To determine the effect on OS of adding enzastaurin to R-CHOP in 
treatment naïve subjects with high-risk DLBCL regardless of DGM1 
biomarker status.  To evaluate Event-free Survival (EFS), including EFS rate at 12 
months (EFS12) and EFS rate at 24 months (EFS24), for all subjects, 
and for subjects who are DGM1 biomarker positive.  To compare the combination phase investigator assessed CR rate and 
objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with high-risk DLBCL 
who are DGM1 biomarker positive administered R-CHOP plus 
enzastaurin versus R-CHOP. 
 To further evaluate the safety profile of enzastaurin when 
administered in conjunction with R-CHOP.  
EXPLORATORY 
OBJECTIVES  To determine enzastaurin and enzastaurin metabolite(s) 
concentrations for incorporation into a subsequent population 
pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis.

STATISTICAL PLAN 
 Study sample size was estimated for the primary efficacy objective. 
The primary outcome of this study is OS, with the primary analysis to be 
conducted in DGM1 biomarker positive subjects. 
Study subjects will be randomized 1:1 to R-CHOP + enzastaurin or 
R-CHOP + placebo. This will be an event driven study. 66 events are 
required to provide approximately 90% power to detect a HR of 0.45 for 
OS in subjects who are positive for the DGM1 biomarker, when using a 
stratified log-rank statistic having one-sided alpha of 0.0235 (Section 
7.4). Statistical significance will be achieved with an estimated HR  0.613. 
Assuming control arm subjects have one-year survival of approximately 
60% to 70% and median survival of approximately [ADDRESS_1142824] an approximate sample size of 200 DGM1 biomarker 
positive subjects. If the enrollment period is 12-18 additional months, 
approximately 12 to 24 additional months will be required for 66 events 
to occur. If approximately 15% of trial subjects will be DGM1 biomarker 
negative, the trial would enroll approximately [ADDRESS_1142825] OF ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITION OF TERMS ..................................................14

population of subjects with DLBCL. The detailed rationale for this study is provided in greater 
depth below. 
1.2 ENZASTAURIN 
Enzastaurin, an acyclic bisindolylmaleimide, is a potent and selective inhibitor of PKC- . At 
plasma concentrations achieved clinically, enzastaurin and its metabolites suppress signaling not 
only through PKC, but also through the PI3K/AKT pathway; these pathways promote tumor-
induced angiogenesis, as well as tumor cell survival and proliferation. Accordingly, inhibition of 
signaling pathways by [CONTACT_824119] 3 
beta([COMPANY_004]3 ) at ser9, induces cell death (apoptosis), and suppresses proliferation in cultured cell 
lines from human colon cancers ( Gokmen-Polar et al., 2001 ), glioblastoma ( da Rocha et al., 
2002), and lymphomas ( Shipp et al., 2002 ). Oral dosing with enzastaurin to achieve exposure 
levels similar to that in human clinical studies suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF)-induced angiogenesis and the growth of human colon cancer and glioblastoma 
xenografts. These studies have demonstrated that enzastaurin can suppress tumor growth  through 
multiple mechanisms: the direct effect of inducing tumor cell death, suppressing tumor cell 
proliferation, and the indirect effect of suppressing tumor-induced angiogenesis. 
Enzastaurin was developed by [CONTACT_105410] (Lilly). Lilly performed 51 clinical studies 
and 15 clinical pharmacology studies of enzastaurin: 39 single-agent studies (enzastaurin alone, 
or enzastaurin with drugs other than anti-cancer agents) and 27 combination studies (enzastaurin 
+ another anti-cancer agent). As of September 2013, a total of 4,387 cancer patients and healthy 
subjects wereenrolled in Lilly-sponsored clinical trials, of whom approximately 3,337 subjects 
received enzastaurin. Of the approximately 3,337 subjects who received enzastaurin, 3,149 were 
cancer patients and 188 were healthy subjects in 9 completed clinical pharmacology studies. In 
2014, Denovo completed the transfer of ownership of enzastaurin to enable its further clinical 
development. Denovo has identified a unique subset of patients with DLBCL who responded 
favorably to enzastaurin in a prior trial of similar design to this current study. 
1.3 SUMMARY OF RELEVANT PRIOR ANIMAL AND HUMAN STUDIES 
1.3.1 Absorption, Metabolism and Drug Interactions 
Food significantly increases exposures to enzastaurin and its metabolites in both healthy subjects 
and cancer patients. Patients are required to take enzastaurin in the fed state in order to maximize 
drug absorption. 
Enzastaurin is primarily metabolized in the liver, with minimal renal elimination. However, 
when enzastaurin was given to cancer patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic 
impairment, exposures tended to be lower than exposures observed in patients with normal 
hepatic function in previous studies, and decreased with increasing severity of hepatic 
dysfunction. It is currently not recommended to administer enzastaurin to patients with moderate 
or severe hepatic impairment.

 Confidential The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzyme appears to be responsible for the observed 
routes of enzastaurin metabolism: 
 Plasma exposures of enzastaurin were reduced significantly in patients receiving CYP3A 
enzyme-inducing anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (EIAEDs) compared to patients not receiving EIAEDs. 
Concomitant medications that are potent inducers of CYP3A are expected to significantly 
decrease enzastaurin exposures. 
 Potent CYP3A inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole) resulted in significantly higher exposures to 
enzastaurin in healthy subjects. Concomitant medications that are potent inhibitors of 
CYP3A are expected to significantly increase enzastaurin exposures. 
 In the presence of the weak CYP3A inhibitor cimetidine, the area under the curve (AUC) and 
maximum plasma concentration (C max) of enzastaurin increased approximately 20%, but 
there was no appreciable effect of cimetidine on the AUC or C max of the metabolite 
LSN326020. Concomitant medications that are weak CYP3A inhibitors are not expected to 
cause clinically significant changes in enzastaurin exposures. 
 Enzastaurin is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A in cancer patients and may increase exposures 
to orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates. 
 In vitro studies suggest that enzastaurin and its major metabolite are inhibitors of CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. If this inhibition occurs in vivo, exposures to drugs that are 
substrates of these enzymes may be increased. A warfarin interaction study in cancer patients 
indicates that enzastaurin is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 (area under the plasma 
concentration time curve from time zero to infinity ratio [AUC 0-] of 1.28). 
 In vitro data indicate that enzastaurin may be a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor. However, in 
a drug interaction study with intravenous (IV) digoxin (a P-gp substrate), 500-mg daily doses 
of enzastaurin did not affect the exposures of digoxin in cancer patients; these results suggest 
that enzastaurin has no effect on P-gp activity in vivo. 
 The administration of a proton pump inhibitor had no significant effect on the exposure to 
enzastaurin when enzastaurin was administered in the fed state. 
 In mice, enzastaurin has been observed to produce an increase in hexobarbital-induced sleep, 
which suggests that enzastaurin may enhance the effect of anesthetic agents. 
 
1.3.2 Preclinical and Clinical Toxicity 
[IP_ADDRESS] Liver 
Liver tumors were noted in a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study; the relevance of this finding to 
humans is unknown. 
Transient, mild increases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransaminase 
(ALT) levels were observed in enzastaurin clinical trials.

DB102-02 Protocol Version 6.0_8 July 2021  Page 19 of 79  
 Confidential [IP_ADDRESS] Cataracts
Cataracts occurred in dogs in a 6-month study at approximately 3- to 5-fold the maximum human 
plasma exposures seen in cancer patients given 525 mg enzastaurin. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Retinal Findings 
High doses of enzastaurin (1500 mg/kg) given to transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mice every day for 
6 months caused hypertrophy of the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_20092] (RPE). These changes were not 
seen in mice given lower doses of enzastaurin for 6 months or in a 1-month study in mice given 
higher doses of enzastaurin. The relevance of this finding to humans is not clear. Some cases of 
blurred vision and also some rare but serious cases of retinal detachment/tear, blurred vision, and 
visual impairment have been reported in clinical trials. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombocytopenia 
Enzastaurin-related thrombocytopenia has been reported and is usually mild and reversible.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hemorrhage 
Hemorrhage, possibly related to enzastaurin, was observed, including reports of possibly related 
fatal cerebral hemorrhage in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. 
[IP_ADDRESS] QTc Prolongation 
Nonclinical data suggest a potential for QT/QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) 
prolongation for both enzastaurin and its active metabolite, LSN326020. QTc prolongation has 
also been observed at steady state, following the administration of enzastaurin 500-mg daily 
doses to cancer patients, and a concentration-QT effect has been observed with higher doses. The 
protocol requires careful and frequent ECG monitoring. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnant or Lactating Women 
Enzastaurin has not been evaluated in pregnant or lactating women, as these subjects have been 
excluded from enzastaurin clinical studies. Therefore, women of childbearing potential must 
have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to taking enzastaurin. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
The most frequent ( 5%) AEs seen in single-agent Phase 1b and 2 enzastaurin studies in cancer 
subjects that were considered by [CONTACT_824120] (15.6%), chromaturia (12.3%), diarrhea (9.4%), nausea (9.3%), platelets decreased 
(7.4%), and transaminase elevated (6.4%). The most frequent adverse drug reactions reported in 
subjects receiving enzastaurin in the DLBCL Phase 3 maintenance study (PRELUDE; H6Q-MC-
JCBJ) were diarrhea (20.1%), chromaturia (19.5%), limb edema (15.8%), and prolonged QTc 
interval (11.63%). In general, the events reported for subjects in combination studies occurred at 
frequencies that were not higher than those described for the anti-cancer agents used.  
1.3.3 Pharmacokinetics in Humans 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of enzastaurin was evaluated in a Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label, 
dose- escalating oral doses of enzastaurin from 
20 mg to 700 mg administered to 47 subjects with advanced or metastatic cancer. The data 
Denovo Biopharma LLC  Enzastaurin 
DB102-02 Protocol Version 6.0_8 July 2021  Page 20 of 79  
 Confidential showed that the maximum drug concentration in plasma (C max) of enzastaurin was reached 
within 4 hours of dosing. The half-life of enzastaurin ranged from 12.3 to 26.7 hours and 
accumulated 1.5- to 3.0-fold upon daily dosing. There was temporal linearity since plasma 
concentrations from Day 1 dosing predicted Day 28 concentrations reasonably well. Dose 
escalation proceeded with only three dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of prolongation of QTc by 
>50 msec over baseline. One of these occurred at the 700-mg dose and two others at the 525-mg 
dose. Laboratory and non-laboratory National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria 
(CTC; NCI 1998, CTC Version 2) Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were not observed at any dose level. 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified to be in the dose range [ADDRESS_1142835] 
commonly reported toxicities were fatigue and reddish discoloration of urine and feces 
(enzastaurin is red in color). Overall, enzastaurin was well tolerated in this study. 
In Study H6Q-MC-JCAJ (JCAJ), a Phase 2 trial of enzastaurin as single-agent therapy in 
subjects with recurrent high-grade glioma, subjects on enzyme-inducing anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_006] 
(EIAEDs) such as phenytoin and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_824097]. 
The pharmacokinetics of enzastaurin was evaluated in 25 native Chinese cancer patients who 
each received a fixed dose of 500 mg of enzastaurin. Twenty-one subjects were available for the 
PK analysis. The T max was found to be approximately four hours and the half-life of enzastaurin 
was found to be approximately 14 hours. The mean AUC at steady state was 29,100 nmol.h/L for 
enzastaurin and 21,800 nmol.h/L for the active metabolite LSN326020. These results compare 
favorably with those from studies in other cancer patients in which the mean AUC ss for 
enzastaurin ranged from 23,600 to 44,100 nmol.h/L and for LSN326020 from 15,000 to 23,000 
nmo.h/L. Enzastaurin appeared to be safe and well tolerated in this population ( Li, X et al., 
2016). 
Previous human studies have shown that 14 days of daily oral dosing is needed to achieve steady 
state exposures of enzastaurin. 
1.3.4 Previous Human Studies of Patients With NHL 
The Lilly  Brochure lists seven studies in 899 subjects in which enzastaurin was 
administered to patients with NHL. Of these, four studies administered enzastaurin to 
approximately 673 subjects with DLBCL. These seven studies are summarized in 
Table 1 below.

DB102-[ADDRESS_1142841] of this model was applied to the Prelude trial. This was a multinational, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of high-risk DLBCL (IPI  3) patients with a 
histologic diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and a CR or CRu, or a negative 
FDG-PET scan after 6 8 cycles of R-CHOP. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:[ADDRESS_1142842] initiated 
treatment. 
The study enrolled 758 subjects (enzastaurin, n = 504; placebo, n = 254). Median age at 
enrollment was 64 years (range 2189); at diagnosis, 65% of patients had stage IV disease, 48% 
had B symptoms, and 25% had a mass >10 cm; baseline disease and patient characteristics were 
well balanced between treatment arms. Fifty-seven percent had a negative PET scan following 
completion of R-CHOP. Median follow-up time for all patients was 48 months (range 0.03 80). 
At the time of analysis, 209 events had occurred. The DFS HR for enzastaurin vs placebo was 
0.92 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.22; 2-sided log-rank p = 0.54). DFS at 24 and 48 months were 79% and 
70% for the enzastaurin arm, and 75% and 71% for placebo, respectively. OS at 24 and 48 
months was 87% and 81% for enzastaurin, and 89% and 82% for placebo; HR for enzastaurin vs 
placebo was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.47; 2-sided log-rank p = 0.81) ( Crump et al., 2013 ). 
DNA samples extracted from blood of patients enrolled in the Prelude trial were genotyped using 
whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Approximately 5 million SNPs 
were analyzed. It was found that a specific configuration for two SNPs located on chromosome 
8, Reference SNP ID 309605 (rs309605) and Reference SNP ID 309604 (rs309604), was 
strongly associated with survival in the enzastaurin arm. The p-value for this association was 5.8 
x 10-9 (Note, given the multiple comparisons performed in exploratory pharmacogenomic 
research, a p-value smaller than 5x10-8 is usually considered the threshold for genome-wide 
significance.).This biomarker is now referred to as the Denovo Genomic Marker 1 (DGM1). 
To confirm these findings from the Prelude trial, an analysis of the DGM1 biomarker was 
performed using archived DNA samples extracted from blood specimens from the P2 study of 
enzastaurin added to R-CHOP therapy in the front-line treatment of patients with intermediate or 
high-risk DLBCL. In this study, 101 subjects were randomized 3:[ADDRESS_1142843] line therapy for intermediate or high-risk DLBCL (enzastaurin-
58 subjects, control-43 subjects). Following the initial treatment period, subjects in the 
enzastaurin group received maintenance enzastaurin for up to 3 years or until disease 
progression. The median PFS for patients in the enzastaurin arm was 36.2 months vs 22.6 
months for in the control arm (HR = 0.73; p = 0.151). After adjusting for imbalances in baseline 
IPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] (  2 vs > 2) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS (0 vs 1 or 2), the 
Denovo Biopharma LLC  Enzastaurin

 Confidential HR was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.32, 1.09; one sided p-0.048) ( Hainsworth et al., 2016 ). In a post-hoc 
subgroup analysis, subjects with an IPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] > 2 had a median PFS that was not evaluable in the 
enzastaurin arm compared to 8.9 months in the control arm (HR = 0.50). The 2-year OS was 
75% and 69% in favor of enzastaurin in the overall population and 71% and 55% in favor of 
enzastaurin in the subset of subjects with an IPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] > 2. Conversely, in the post-hoc subgroup 
analysis, subjects with intermediate risk (IPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] 2) had an estimated increase in mortality from 
the addition of enzastaurin; approximately 90% of patients with IPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] 2 in the enzastaurin 
arm were DGM1 positive. 
The Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS ( Figure 1) and OS ( Figure 2) are shown below.

more favorable efficacy in high-risk DLBCL subjects and this efficacy is also observed in 
subjects who possess the DGM1 biomarker ( Figure 4). The mOS for DGM1 positive, high-risk

1.5 STUDY RATIONALE 
The purpose of this study is to prospectively confirm the biomarker analysis results of the Phase 
2 (study H6Q-MC-S028)study of enzastaurin in subjects with newly diagnosed high-risk 
DLBCL. The primary objective will be to analyze the effect on OS of adding enzastaurin to R-
CHOP therapy in high-risk DLBCL (IPI  3) subjects who possess the DGM1 biomarker. This 
study aims to determine whether there is markedly improved survival in this enriched population 
compared to the current standard of care, R-CHOP alone. This study will be conducted in the 
[LOCATION_002], China and possibly other countries with an appropriate incidence of biomarker 
positive patients. The range of biomarker-positive subjects is approximately 68% for subjects of 
African ancestry living in the Southwest [LOCATION_002], approximately 90% for subjects of 
European ancestry, to approximately 95% of subjects living in Beijing, China. (International

Confidential 3.1 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN
This study is designed to confirm the biomarker analysis results of the Phase2 (H6Q-MC-S028) 
study that suggested improved efficacy by [CONTACT_824127] R-CHOP therapy in 
subjects with high-risk DLBCL who possess the DGM1 biomarker. Consequently, most of the 
features of that trial have been maintained in the current protocol. In order to minimize the 
potential for bias, the study will utilize a blinded, placebo-controlled design during the 
combination phase. In order to ensure that subjects are able to make an informed decision on 
their care, the treatment assignment of all subjects will be unblinded following completion of the 
combination phase and subsequent tumor assessment. 
While a number of prognostic indices have been developed for patients with DLBCL, the Phase 
index will be used in th e current study. Thi s index define s 5 variables : age (> 60), tumor stage 
(III or IV), numbe r of extranoda l sites (> 1), ECOG performanc e status (> 1) and serum lactate 
dehydrogenas e (LDH) (> 1 times upper limit of normal). O ne point is assigned for each variable 
and subject s with [ADDRESS_1142849] 3 points in order to be eligible for 
this study (See Appendix B. International Prognostic Index ). 
Because of the small number of biomarker negati ve subjects exposed t o enzastaurin i n Phase 2, 
biomarke r negative subjects, a s well as biomarke r positive subjects, will be enrolled in this 
study.

4.3 RATIONALE FOR KEY EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
This study is designed to confirm the biomarker analysis results of the Phase2 (H6Q-MC-S028) 
study that demonstrated improved efficacy by [CONTACT_824127] R-CHOP therapy in 
subjects with high-risk DLBCL who possess the DGM1 biomarker. Consequently, most of the 
features of that trial have been maintained in the current protocol. Because the number of DGM1 
biomarker negative subjects treated in that study was too small to definitively assess their 
response to enzastaurin, both biomarker positive and negative subjects will be enrolled in the 
current study. 
Because enzastaurin can prolong the QT interval, patients with a personal or immediate family

screening, a history of ventricular arrhythmias requiring medication within [ADDRESS_1142861], 
particularly as the cumulative dose exceeds 300 mg/m2. 
Although subjects with chronic hepatitis B infections may be treated with R-CHOP in 
conjunction with antiviral medication, the lack of PK or safety data with such combinations 
has prompted the exclusion of patients with chronic hepatitis B and C infections from this 
study.

x 109/L if documented bone marrow involvement, delay dose at least 1 week
(maximum delay 21 days) until counts are above these levels. Recommend instituting 
granulocyte-colony stimulating factors if not already done so. 
For patients with symptomatic Grade 3 or any Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity (except 
alopecia, nausea, and vomiting), treatment should bedelayed untiltoxicityresolves to Grade 1
or baseline, then continue with75% doses of offending agents. 
Other toxicity delays of any of the individual chemotherapy regimen drugs (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) are allowed. Other toxicity delays 
for R-CHOP as an unit are allowed to a maximum of two  14-day delays over all the 6 
treatment cycles. 
Even if R-CHOP is discontinued early, subjects who would otherwise qualify for single-agent 
treatment ( Section 5.1.3 ) may move on to the single-agent phase of the study, at the discretion of 
the investigator. 
Rituximab product (Rituxan/MabThera or an FDA-approved rituximab biosimilar) will not be 
dose reduced, but infusion rates should be changed in accordance with the prescribing 
information listed in the package insert. Dose reductions for individual component of CHOP are 
allowed per local institutional practice or package insert. 
Dose modifications for changes in weight may be conducted per institutional practice. It is 
suggested that body weight change of more than 10% from weight used for previous dose 
calculation should lead to recalculation of BSA and dose adjustment if necessary.

5.7.[ADDRESS_1142881] enzastaurin exposure. Concomitant drugs that 
are inducers of CYP3A could result in lower exposures of enzastaurin and its metabolites while 
concomitant drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A may increase the exposure of enzastaurin and its 
metabolite(s) in patients. Potent inhibitors of CYP3A, such as ketoconazole, are expected to 
increase enzastaurin exposure. Based on these considerations, subjects who require therapy with 
a strong inducer or moderate or strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 should not be enrolled into the 
study. If medically justified, subjects may be enrolled if such inhibitors or inducers can be 
discontinued or alternative drugs that do not affect these enzymes can be substituted > [ADDRESS_1142882] of moderate and potent CYP3A inhibitors and potent inducers is found in Appendix A . 
In order to avoid potential drug-drug interaction it is recommended that subjects enrolled in this 
study not use traditional Chinese medications while participating in this study. 
Subjects on enzyme-inducing anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (EIAED) such as phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
and phenobarbital should be switched to non-EIAEDs such as levetiracetam, gabapentin,

doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 4-ketocyclophosphamide or dechloroethyl-cyclophosphamide. 
5.7.3 Colony-Stimulating Factors 
Use of colony-stimulating factors (eg, filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) as primary prophylaxis is

 Confidential 6.3 SAFETY EVALUATIONS
6.3.1 Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event (AE) 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
whether or not considered to have been caused by [CONTACT_33641]. An AE may be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a drug and does not imply any judgment about causality (21 CFR 312.32a). 
Examples include: reactions or side effects, a pre-existing condition that worsens in severity or 
frequency, a concurrent illness, an injury, or a clinically significant laboratory abnormality. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that meets at least one of the following criteria: 
 Is fatal 
 Is life-threatening (A life-threatening AE is an AE that places the subject at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred. It does not include a reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928], excluding 
emergency room visits. (See Section 6.3.5  for other excluded events) 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of an exposed 
subject.(Note: pregnancy in a study subject should be reported promptly to the sponsor on 
the appropriate form, and depending on the regulations for each region, may also need to 
be reported promptly to the regulatory authorities.) 
 Other important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
The onset date of an SAE is defined as the date on which it met the criteria for an SAE; eg, the 
date of admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The end date is the date on which it no longer met the criteria for 
an SAE, eg, the date that the subject was discharged from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Investigational Product 
In this study, some subjects will be receivingboth R-CHOP and enzastaurin; enzastaurin is 
considered the investigational product and the investigator should assess each AE for its possible 
relationship to enzastaurin, not the other medications in this treatment regimen. The relationship 
of an adverse event to the investigational product should be classified by [CONTACT_824139]:

The severity of an AE should be defined according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03. AEs that are not listed in the 
NCI Common Toxicity Criteria should be evaluated using the following guidelines: 
1 = Mild AE: Awareness of symptom, but easily tolerated; usually transient requiring no 
special treatment; does not interfere with usual status or activities 
2 = Moderate AE: May be ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212]; may interfere 
with usual activities 
3 = Severe AE: Incapacitating, inability to perform usual activities

7.4 SAMPLE SIZE AND EFFICACY ANALYSES 
Study sample size was estimated for the primary efficacy objective.  
The primary outcome of this study is overall survival (OS), with the primary analysis to be 
conducted in DGM1 biomarker positive subjects. Study subjects will be randomized 1:1 to R-
CHOP plus enzastaurin or R-CHOP plus placebo. The family-wise type-I error rate will be 
-sided) of 2.5% by [CONTACT_824145]1 biomarker-positive subgroup and the entire ITT population. Since the 
primary objective of the study is to compare the effect of R-CHOP plus enzastaurin versus R-
CHOP on OS in DLBCL subjects who are DGM1 positive, the OS superiority test will be 
conducted at 1-sided significance level of 2.35% in the DGM1 positive subgroup. The alpha 
level allocated to the OS analysis in the entire population will be derived based on the actual 
number of OS events observed in the DGM1 positive subgroup and in the entire population at 
final analysis using the approach presented by (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_190503] B & Debois M, 2010). At the final 
Denovo Biopharma LLC  Enzastaurin 
DB102-02 Protocol Version 6.0_8 July 2021  Page 54 of 79  
 Confidential analysis, if the ratio of observed OS events in the DGM1 positive subgroup over the entire 
population is, as anticipated, 85%, (ie, 66/78 OS events), then statistical significance will be 
achieved in the OS analysis in the entire population at an alpha level (1-sided) of approximately 
1%. 
This will be an event driven study. In the trial 66 events are required to provide approximately 
90% power to detect a HR of 0.[ADDRESS_1142900] on OS, which was supported by [CONTACT_824146] (HR (95% CI): 0.28 (0.1, 0.81) in the same target population, see Section 1.1). 
Assuming control arm patients have one-year survival of approximately 60% to 70% and median 
survival of approximately [ADDRESS_1142901] an approximate sample size of 200 
DGM1 biomarker positive subjects. If the enrollment period is 12-18 months, approximately 12 
to 24 additional months will be required for 66 events to occur. Recognizing that the number of 
66 events is fixed while the sample size is an approximation, the sample size will be re-assessed 
as the enrollment target of 200 DGM1 biomarker positive subjects is approached.  
It is expected that approximately 15% of trial subjects will be DGM1 biomarker negative. Since 
the trial sponsor and investigators will not have access to data on DGM1 biomarker status, the enrollment required to achieve, in the 
projected timeframe, the targeted 66 events in the DGM1 biomarker positive subjects. If, for 
example, the DGM1 biomarker negative rate is approximately 15%, the trial would enroll 
approximately [ADDRESS_1142902] 66 OS events occur from all subjects who are DGM1 biomarker positive 
(DGM1+), AND 
 either 22 OS events (ie
are reached from US DGM1+ subjects, or [ADDRESS_1142903]. This requirement is to ensure a meaningful 
subgroup analysis of OS in each geographic region. 
If the addition of enzastaurin provides a statistically significance improvement in OS in the 
primary analysis in the DGM1 biomarker positive subjects and the entire population, then this 
conclusion of benefit would be extended to the DGM1 biomarker negative subjects if, in that 
subgroup, the estimated HR  0.641, (Rothmann, 2012 ), which is the estimated effect that would

 Confidential Section6.1.3.If significance for the OS analysis is achieved in the DGM1 biomarker-positive 
subgroup and/or in the entire population, then the procedure will proceed to test three secondary 
measures in a pre-specified hierarchical manner using the specific method described below at the 
alpha level that is passed through the significance level for testing OS. During the testing, if any 
endpoint fails at the  level, then the subsequent endpoint(s) will be evaluating in a descriptive 
manner by [CONTACT_824147] p-values. 
1. The analysis of EFS will be performed by [CONTACT_824148]. EFS rate at [ADDRESS_1142905] error, 95% CI of EFS rate and between group comparison will 
be performed using Greenwood method.
2. The CR in DGM1 biomarker positive subjects, will be analyzed using Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method stratified by [CONTACT_441122].
3. ORR (CR+PR) in DGM1 biomarker positive subjects, will be analyzed using CMH 
method stratified by [CONTACT_441122].  
With the sample size derived to properly power the testing for the primary efficacy measure 
(OS), there will be approximately 89% power to detect a treatment difference of 20% in CR rate 
(secondary measure) at completion of the combination phase in DGM1 biomarker positive 
subjects, assuming a control arm CR rate at 18%. 
Approximately 100 EFS events from DGM1 biomarker-positive patients are expected when the 
targeted 66 OS events from DGM1 biomarker-positive patients are reached. A total of 100 EFS 
events would provide 80% and 90% statistical power to detect a treatment effect on EFS when 
the true HR would be 0.[ADDRESS_1142906] will be included in the 
safety analysis. The analysis will include:

1. Perform on all subjects after completion of last R-CHOP cycle; all assessments except PET-CT, BMB and unblinding to be performed 22 days (-1/+3 days) from last 
administration of rituximabproduct. PET-CT, BMBand unblinding occurs as described below (pleasesee footnote #12 and #14).
2. Enzastaurin arm only for those patients with CR (PR at . The initial 
single-agent visit, V9, should occur as soon as possible but no later than 3 days after unblinding. Note: the interval between V11 and V12 is 12 weeks
3. Performed for subjects who discontinue or complete study therapy (-/+ 7 days visit window). If the previous laboratory tests and ECG were performed after last dose of 
study treatment and this was 1 week prior to EOT visit, the laboratory tests and ECG do not need to be repeated. Urinalysis and urine color to be collected if not 
collected at V9 during the single agent phase. 
4. Subjects contact[CONTACT_108229].
5. Submit after randomization, preferably before the end of Cycle 1.  
6. Height will only be performed at V1. 
7. At Visit 1 (C1D2 or C1D3, on whichever day enzastaurin/placebo loading dose is given), C2D1, and C4D1 perform ECG prior to and approximately 4-6 hours after 
enzastaurin/placebo dose. ECG on C6D1, V9, V12-17 and EOT is performed prior to any study treatment if applicable. During treatment, hold enzastaurin if QTc > 500

 Confidential msec; perform triplicate ECGs approximately five minutes apart; see Section 5.5.1 for further guidance. If R-CHOP is expected to be delayed greater than 7 days but 
enzastaurin/placebo is being taken, ECG should be performed as an unscheduled visit at the temporal timepoint and repeated on the appropriate Cycle/Day when cycles 
are restarted (ie, R-CHOP administered). 
8. Perform ECG prior to and approximately 4-6 hours after enzastaurin/placebo first dose on C1D2 or C1D3, whichever day the enzastaurin/placebo loading dose is taken. 
9. V9 only.
10. Collect AE/SAEs as described in Section 6.3.[ADDRESS_1142921] 4 weeks but preferably 6 to 8 weeks after completion of R-CHOP; weeks calculated from last administration of rituximab product. (See Appendix D ) 
15. Preform as medically/clinically indicated by [CONTACT_9518]. 
16. Perform after R-CHOP administration at the end of Cycle 3 (See Appendix D  for further guidance). PET-CT without contrast is acceptable per local SOC. 
17. A bone marrow biopsy (BMB) is not required at screening/baseline unless clinically indicated (eg, to evaluate indeterminant PET-CT findings, cytopenia, or presence of 
discordant lymphoma). BMB is required at end of combination treatment in those patients who have otherwise achieved a CR and had a positive BMB at 
screening/baseline. 
18. For Screening, within 14 days of randomization on study: may be performed 1-2 days prior to R-CHOP administration during combination phase if that is the enrolling 
t of the investigator patient safety is not compromised, C1D1 CBC and chemistry not 
required if Screening CBC and chemistry performed up to 3 days prior to C1D1. 
19. Urinalysis and urine color will be performed using ambient urine sample  by [CONTACT_6626]; Sponsor and clinical sites will be blinded to the results of urine color. 
20. Only for subjects who do not enter into single-agent phase. 
21. For Screening, must be negative within 7 days prior to randomization in women with reproductive potential. Subsequent pregnancy tests may be performed 1-2 days 
prior to R-  
22. PK samples to be collected: C2D1 pre-dose and C4D1 3-[ADDRESS_1142922] enzastaurin/placebo dose. 
23. Whole blood sample collected for DGM1 testing and stored for immuno-typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (includes potential additional biomarker analysis and lymphoma subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]). DGM1 
biomarker testing will be performed by [CONTACT_824166]. Samples will be collected at C1D1 for all 
subjects and at V9 for those subjects who entered single-agent phase and at EOT for all other subjects.  
24. R-CHO administered on Day 1 and prednisone (P) given Days 1-5. A cretion, rituximab product may be given alone on Day 1 with other components 
of CHOP given on Day 2. Prednisone would then be given Days 2-6.  
25. Loading dose given on C1D2 unless R-CHOP is split over two days, then given on C1D3. Loading dose = 3 tabs TID approximately 30 minutes after a meal. Dose on all 
following days: 4 tablets QD taken together daily approximately 30 minutes after a meal. If necessary (eg, because of pause in R-CHOP dosing), study drug can be 
dispensed at an unscheduled visit.

 Confidential APPENDIX D. TUMOR ASSESSMENT
 
Tumor Assessment Criteria  
The determination of response and progression will be based on standardized criteria: Lugano 
Classification ( Cheson 2014 ). 
Method of Assessment  
Imaging-based evaluation will be used in this study as the primary basis of DLBCL response 
assessment. The recommended and preferred method for radiographic tumor assessment for this 
study is fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/computed tomography 
(CT) scan (PET-CT). If PET-CT is unavailable, a contrast-enhanced CT may be substituted; 
contrast material may be omitted in subjects for whom use of a contrast agent becomes medically 
contraindicated. MRI scanning is not advised b
subjects for whom this is a necessary alternative to CT scanning. 
Hybrid PET-CT scanners may be used to acquire the required CT images only if CT produced by 
[CONTACT_824169] (unless medically 
contraindicated). Non-diagnostic CT images acquired for attenuation purposes during the PET-
CT are not acceptable as the only CT scan for the timepoint. Diagnostic CT images with contrast 
(unless medically contraindicated) with a standalone CT scanner must be acquired if PET-CT is 
unable to acquire diagnostic CT images. 
If the diagnostic CT and PET are acquired on the same day, it is strongly recommended that the 
PET is performed prior to the CT with IV contrast. 
Recommended that PET images be converted to SUV maps to support comparison across 
timepoints and to standardize viewing conditions. 
For radiographic assessments, it is highly recommended that the same method of assessment and 
the same technique (eg, scan type, scanner, subject position, dose of contrast, injection/scan 
interval) be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during study 
treatment and follow-up. Whole-body PET-CT scanning should be extended from the base of the 
skull to mid-thigh. If CT is used, images of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be 
performed with cuts of  0.[ADDRESS_1142925] be made available for source verification as requested by [CONTACT_4530]. 
The 5 Point Scale (5-PS) is used for PET interpretation (see table below).

3 Uptake > mediastinum but  liver 
4 Uptake moderately > liver 
5 Uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions 
X New areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma 
Adapted from Cheson 2014  
 
Timing of Disease Assessments  
During screening, imaging-based tumor assessments should be performed within the specified 
screening period. On-study tumor assessments should be performed as indicated in the SOE 
(Table 6) which includes an interim assessment and an end of combination treatment assessment. 
If PET-CT, rather than CT, performed at the interim assessment timepoint (after Cycle 3 R-
CHOP administration), it should be performed as long as possible after the administration of R-
CHOP but before the next cycle (eg, C3D20); interim assessment should not result in a change in 
therapy unless there is biopsy-proven evidence of refractory lymphoma or lymphoma 
progression. 
At the completion of the combination phase, a restaging tumor assessment (PET-CT) will be 
performed at least [ADDRESS_1142926] cycle of 
R-CHOP; weeks calculated from the last administration of rituximab product.

DB102-[ADDRESS_1142928] Based Response Assessment 
All involved areas using 5-Point Scale should be assessed. 
A bone marrow biopsy (BMB) is not required at screening/baseline unless clinically indicated 
(eg, to evaluate indeterminant PET-CT findings, cytopenia, or presence of discordant 
lymphoma). BMB is required at end of treatment in those patients who have otherwise achieved 
a CR and had a positive BMB at screening/baseline. 
CT Based Response Assessment  
Target Lesions 
Up to [ADDRESS_1142929] target nodes, nodal masses, or extranodal lesions that are clearly 
measurable in two diameters (longest diameter [LDi] and shortest diameter) should be selected 
as target lesions that will be used to quantitate the status of the disease during study treatment. 
Ideally, the target lesions should be in disparate regions of the body representative of the overall 
disease burden and include mediastinal, abdominal, and retroperitoneal areas of disease 
whenever these sites are involved. 
Extranodal lesions include those in solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), GI 
involvement, and cutaneous lesions. 
Target lesions will be measured and recorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during 
treatment. 
A measurable node: LDi > 1.5cm 
A measurable extranodal lesion: LDi > 1.0cm 
Non-Measured Lesions 
All other lesions, not selected as measured, dominant disease including nodal, extranodal and 
assessable disease but are still considered abnormal should be followed as non-measured (non-
target) disease (eg, cutaneous, GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural or pericardial effusions, 
ascites). 
Spleen 
The spleen should be measured and recorded at baseline and at stipulated intervals during 
treatment. The spleen will be considered enlarged if > 13 cm in vertical (cranial to caudal) length 
by [CONTACT_4654].

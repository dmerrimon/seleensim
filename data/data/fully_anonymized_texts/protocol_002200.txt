 2. Introduction  
2.1. Background  
Cellulite  is a common condition that occurs in a large  proportion of the female  population. It is a 
benign condition which manifests in lumpy, dimpled flesh on the thighs, hips, buttocks and 
abdomen. Cellulite is a multifactorial disease of the skin, fat, and connective tissues.  The 
anatomical structure of the skin/fat layer includes vertical fibers of connective tissue (fibrous septa) which tether the skin to subcutaneous fascia. When fat cells enlarge and the dermal layer 
thins and loses elastin, the fat layer bulges, causing the undesirable appearance of dimples and 
waviness.  
ZELTIQ Aesthetics has developed and commercialized cryolipolysis technology for non-invasive 
cold- assisted lipolysis.  The CoolSculpting technology is based on the sensitivity of fat cells to 
cold injury in order to selectively eliminate subcutaneous fat tissue. The CoolSculpting System is 
cleared  for use in the United  States  for the indication of cold- assisted  lipolysis  of the thighs, flank, 
abdomen, submental and submandibular areas, bra fat, back fat, and banana roll; as well as temporary reduction of cellulite.  
Mild to moderate improvement in cellulite following the CoolSculpting procedure has been reported in the literature.
[ADDRESS_903614] the appearance of the flanks (DEN090002), the abdomen (K120023), the thighs (K133212), the submental area (K151179), and bra fat, back fat, and banana roll (K160259). Additionally,  the System  has been  cleared  for flexible  treatment parameter  ranges (K142491).  
The device was also previously cleared for cooling as a method to minimize localized pain and thermal injury during laser and dermatological treatments under: K060407 (initial clearance), 
K063715 (clearance for warming  and massage),  K072152 (clearance for flat and belt applicators),

 K080118 (clearance for vacuum applicator),  and K090094 (clearance for commercial  device).  
This study will investigate the use of the FDA -cleared CoolSculpting System for treatment of 
cellulite  in the thigh area.  Results from  this study  will be used in development of future  studies 
for an indication approval. 
2.4 Device Description  
The CoolSculpting System is comprised of a control unit (Figure 1), which houses the system 
controller and power source, and a detachable applicator which is used to apply cooling and/or 
warming to the treatment site.  The study treatments will be performed using the CoolSculpting 
System with either a surface applicator (Figure 2) or a vacuum applicator (Figure 3), depending on applicator conformity and tissue quality of the  treatment area. The surface applicator has a flat 
cooling surface that is placed  on the treatment  area.  The vacuum applicator uses vacuum pressure 
to draw tissue into the cup shaped applicator; tissue is then cooled inside the cup in a controlled 
manner.

6 Statis
tical Methodology and Analyses  
6.1 Primary  Endpoints  
The primary  endpoints of the study are defined  as follows:  
• Safety Endpoint: The frequency of device and procedure- related adverse events (AEs), 
including device- related  serious adverse events (SADEs)  and unanticipated adverse events, 
will be summarized.  
• Efficacy  Endpoint: Comparison of baseline and 12- week  post-final treatment  photographs 
to assess visible changes in the treated areas.  
6.2 Statistical Methods:  Overall Plan 
Data  will be summarized based  on the nature of the data.  Dichotomous (e.g., gender, 
independent photographic review) and ordinal (e.g., Fitzpatrick Skin type) data will 
be tabulated  by [CONTACT_17203]. The mean,  standard  error,  maximum and minimum will be 
tabulated for continuous data (e.g., age). The significance level will be two -sided  
0.[ADDRESS_903624] of all the treated participants with safety evaluation after the 
treatment.  This cohort should be identical to the As Treated  (AT)  cohort. The safety 
data analyses will be performed based on the Safety Cohort. 
6.3.2 Effectiveness Cohorts  
Two groups of subjects will be identified for the analysis of effectiveness endpoints: 
Per Protocol Cohort and the As Treated  Cohort. All analyses  of effectiveness will be

 6.3.4 Missin
g Data  Handling  
In general,  no imputation  for missing  data will be made.  Data  will be analyzed  “as- 
is” where subjects with missing data not being included in the analysis. 
6.3.5 Data  Pooling 
Data are assumed to be poolable across sites due to: 1) use of the same study 
protocol, 2) equivalent training  of all sites in the study protocol and use of the 
investigational device, 3) use of the same CRF at each site, and 4) use of Independent Evaluator(s). 
7 Adverse Events  
Adverse events  (AE)  will be  collected  and assessed  continuously throughout the study. An 
AE is defined in accordance with ISO [ADDRESS_903625] clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in study participants, users,  or other persons temporally  associated  with the use of 
study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. 
Disease signs and symptoms that existed prior to the study treatment are not considered 
AEs unless the condition recurs after the patient has recovered from the pre -existing 
condition or the condition worsens in intensity or frequency during the study. 
Adverse events will be monitored  throughout the study beginning with signing of informed 
consent. At  each post- baseline visit,  the investigator will  begin querying for  AEs  by [CONTACT_668951] a general, non -directed question such as “Have you had any changes to your 
condition since your last visit?” Previous AEs and changes in therapy/concomitant 
medications  are to be updated. Directed  questioning and examination  will then be done as

 appropriate. All AEs and clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings will be 
documented on the appropriate CRF. 
Adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, collecting and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered  related  to the study treatment  or study procedures, or that caused  the participant 
to discontinue the study until the event has resolved  or until [ADDRESS_903626] (ADE)  
Any sign, symptom,  or disease  in a study subject  that occurs during the course of a 
clinical trial that is determined by [CONTACT_95334] a causal relationship or possible causal relationship with the device under investigation. This definition includes any AE s resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device as well as any event resulting from use error (per ISO [ZIP_CODE]) or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_903627]  (SADE)  
A serious adverse device  effect  (SADE)  is defined in accordance with ISO 
[ZIP_CODE] as “an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.”  
7.1.[ADDRESS_903628] ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
An unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) is defined in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] as “any serious adverse device effect which by [CONTACT_5942],  incidence,  severity,  or outcome has not been  identified  in the 
current version of the risk analysis report.” The investigator is to consult the IFU for anticipated risks or anticipated AEs.  
7.1.3 Serious  Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE  is defined in accordance with  ISO [ZIP_CODE] as an AE that: 
1. Led to death  
2. Led to serious  deterioration  in the health  of the patient,  that 
either resulted in:  
a. a life-threatening illness or injury, or 
b. a permanent impairment of a body structure  or a body function, or 
c. inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or

or birth defect 
NOTE: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a 
procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered an SAE. 
7.1.4 Time  Period and Frequency  for Collecting  AE and SAE Information  
All AEs  and SAEs  from the signing of the Informed  Consent Form  (ICF)  until the 
last follow- up visit will be collected  at the time  points specified  in the schedule of 
activities, and as observed or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_19288]. 
Medical occurrences that begin after signing of informed consent and before 
administration  of study treatment  will be recorded as an AE on the appropriate  CRF.  
All SAEs  will be recorded and submitted  to the Sponsor or designee within  24 hours 
of learning about the event using the SAE form. All non- serious AEs related to the 
devices used in the study, as well as Device Complaints, will be submitted to the Sponsor within 7 working days. The investigator will submit any updates on these events to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE in former study 
participants.  However,  if the investigator learns  of any SAE,  including a death,  at 
any time after a participant has completed the final visit of the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly report the event to the Sponsor.  
7.1.5 Method  of Detecting AEs  and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open- ended and non-leading  verbal  questioning of the participant  is the preferred  method 
to inquire about possible AEs. 
7.1.6 Follow- up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization based on investigator’s assessment, the event is otherwise explained, the participant is lost to follow-up or until [ADDRESS_903629] of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_29551]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as

 possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathological examinations,  or consultation  with other  health  care professionals.  
New or updated information will be recorded  in the originally  completed CRF.  
The investigator will submit  any updated SAE  data to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of receipt of the information.  
7.1.7 Reportable  Serious  Adverse Events  (SAEs)  
Serious adverse events (SAEs  and SADEs)  as well as unanticipated  adverse device 
effects (UADEs) /unanticipated serious adverse device effects ([LOCATION_003]DE) must be reported within [ADDRESS_903630] will be 
recorded on the appropriate CRF, irrespective of the relationship to the investigational device used in the study. Medically  significant  adverse events will be 
followed until resolved or considered stable at investigator’s discretion. For each event, the investigator will record a description, dates of onset and resolution, severity, and relationship to the investigational device. The investigator may be required to provide follow -up information as- needed to fulfill requirements for 
regulatory reporting.  
Any adverse event that results in withdrawal  from the study must be reported  to the 
Sponsor after the decision to withdraw the subject is made. 
Any death  occurring during the study  must be reported  to the Sponsor within  24 
hours.  
If an event  is classified  as an SADE  or a UADE/[LOCATION_003]DE,  the Sponsor will determine 
if there is an unreasonable risk to the patients within the study.  In the event a 
UADE/[LOCATION_003]DE  is reported  during this study, it will be reported  to the IRB and to the 
regulatory agencies as appropriate according to the relevant standard operating 
procedures and law of the country where the trial is performed. 
7.1.8 Assessment  of Severity  
Severity  of adverse events will  be determined using the following scale:  
• Mild : Event that is easily tolerated and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
• Moderate: Events that interfere  with usual  activities  of daily  living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant. It is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention.  
• Severe: Event that is incapacitating, with inability  to work  and do

 the usual activities  of daily  living,  or significantly  affects  clinical 
status. This may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
7.1.9 Assessment  of Relatedness 
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship  between  study 
treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A reasonable possibility  of a relationship  conveys that there  are facts, 
evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather 
than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• The investigator will use clinical  judgment to determine  the relatedness.  
• Alternative  causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, 
and other risk factors,  as well  as the temporal relationship  of the  event 
to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. 
• The investigator will also consult the investigator’s brochure and/or product information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE,  the investigator must  document in the medical  notes 
that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE  and has provided an assessment 
of relatedness.  
• For each AE/SAE,  there are 4 levels of  relatedness,  as follows: 
• Not related  
• Possible  
• Probable  
• Definite  relationship  
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is 
very important  that the investigator always make  an assessment  of relatedness for 
every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor. 
• The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_668945] -up information and send an SAE follow -up report with the 
updated relatedness assessment.  
• The relatedness assessment  is one of the criteria  used when 
determining regulatory reporting requirements.

The investigator will determine  the relationship of each adverse event  to the study 
device using the question: "Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may be 
related to treatment with the device? Answer 'yes' or 'no' for each adverse event." 
The guideline below should be used to consider relatedness: 
For a “not related” assessment, the adverse event:  
• May be judged to be due to extraneous causes  such as 
disease or environment or toxic factors 
• May be judged to be due to the subject's clinical  state or other 
therapy being administered  
• Is not biologically  plausible  
• Does  not reappear  or worsen  when  the investigational device is re- 
administered  
• Does  not follow  a temporal sequence from  treatment  with the 
investigational device,  
For an assessment of relatedness (including, probable and possible 
assessments)  there  is a reasonable possibility  that the event  may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_14882], the adverse event:  
• Follows a temporal sequence from treatment  with the device.  
• Is a known response to the device based  on clinical or 
nonclinical data.  
• Could not be explained by [CONTACT_7199]'s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other therapy 
administered.  
• Disappears  or decreases  upon cessation  of the use of the 
device.  
• Reappears or worsens when  the device is re-administered.

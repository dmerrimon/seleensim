A Double -Blind , Placeb o-Controlled  Study of Dronabinol in Trichotillomania  
 
This clinical trial will be conducted in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_863618] (GCP) and in 
accordance with this IRB approved protocol.  No deviation from the protocol will be 
implemented without the pri or review and approval of the IRB except where it may be necessary 
to eliminate an immediate hazard to a research subject.  In  such a case, the deviation will be 
reported to the IRB as soon as possible.  
 
Investigational Agent  and Dosing  
 
 Dronabinol 5mg to  15mg po qday 
 
Population  
 
 The population to be studied for this trial is [ADDRESS_1204266] a 
current DSM -5 diagnosis of trichotillomania  or other body focused repetitive behavior (BFRB) 
(e.g., skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221614]) . 
 
Project Goals  
 
 The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dronabinol  in 
trichotillomania . 50 subjects with DSM -5 trichotillomania  or other BFRB will receive 10 weeks 
of double -blind  dronabinol  or placebo . The hypothesis to be tested is that dronabinol  will be 
effective and well tolerated in patients with trichotillomania  or other BFRBs  compared to 
placebo. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of disabling disorder s 
that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.  
 
Background  
 
Pathological hair -pulling, trichotillomania, has been defined as repetitive, intentionally 
performed pulling that causes noticeable hair loss and results in clinically significant distress or 
functional impairment ( 1). Although discussed in the medical literature for over one hundred 
years, and affecting all strata of society, there have been no epi[INVESTIGATOR_863619]. Behavior al therapy is generally regarded as the first -line treatment but trained 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_221616]. In addition, there is no medication currently approved by [CONTACT_863634].  Trichotillomania is related clinica lly to other 
BFRBs, specifically skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221614]. In fact, it appears that trichotillomania and skin 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_221617] a common neurobiology.  Other BFRBs such as skin ppi[INVESTIGATOR_863620], but evidence suggests that both skin 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_863621].  
 
The Trichotillomania Impact Project survey showed that only 15% of adults in the 
community with trichotillomania  reported experiencing si gnificant improvement with treatment 
of their symptoms  (2). This may be because of the ongoing difficulty of finding a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] 
                                                                                                                      
 3 experienced in trichotillomania  treatments. More than 55% of persons in this survey believed 
that their clinician did not have sufficient knowledge of the disorder, and less than one -third were 
receiving evidence -based treatments for trichotillomania  (2). 
A recent meta -analytic study of randomized treatment trials in adults demonstrated that 
behavioral treatments, mainly habit rev ersal therapy, have the greatest efficacy in treatment of 
trichotillomania  and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_863622] (3).  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are 
the most widely used treatment for adults with trichotillomania  and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221614] , despi[INVESTIGATOR_863623]  (3).   
Instead of using SSRIs, w e conducted an open -label study of dronabinol  a synthetic form 
of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) approved by [CONTACT_863635] , in 14 women with trichotillomania and 
found that 9  (64.3%)  responded to treatment and that the mean effective dose was 11.6 ± 4.1 
mg/day  (4). 
Recent stud ies using diffusion tensor imaging demonstrated that both trichotillomania 
and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221618], pre -supplementary motor area, and temporal c ortices ( 5). These data suggest that the 
disorganization of white matter tracts in motor habit generation and suppression may underlie the 
pathophysiology of the se disorder s (5). Neurochemically, motor habits may rely partially on the 
endocannabinoid syste m. CB1 receptors are highly expressed in the basal ganglia nuclei, the 
hippocampus, cerebellum, and neocortex ( 6-7) and are implicated in attenuating glutamatergic 
exocitotoxic damage by [CONTACT_863636] ( 8-10). The activation of CB1 receptors reduces glutamate release in the dorsal and 
ventral striatum [possibly through an interaction with brain -derived neurotrophic factor ( 11)], 
thereby [CONTACT_863637] ( 12). 
Stress -induced anxious behavior has been associated with the loss of CB1 receptor function in 
the striatum ( 13). 
Glutamatergic dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
trichotillomania ( 14-15). Pharmacotherapie s, such as dronabinol, that target excessive 
glutamatergic drive through its effects on CB1  Receptors may, therefore, be expected to correct 
the underlying pathophysiology and symptoms of trichotillomania.  
In the [LOCATION_003], dronabinol is FDA -approved for the tr eatment of anorexia associated with 
weight loss in patients with AIDS and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer 
chemotherapy. In our previous study examining dronabinol for trichotillomania , doses between 5 
and 15mg /day were well tolerated and benefic ial (4). This lack of significant side effects is 
consistent with other studies of dronabinol where it has been  associated primarily with central 
nervous system -related adverse events (for example, confusion, dizziness, euphoria, and 
somnolence) , but these  adverse events are generally mild to moderate in severity and generally 
reversible upon dose modification ( 16-17). 
Given the serious p ersonal consequences associated with trichotillomania  and skin 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_221614] , and the likelihood of success of dronabi nol in treating both disorder s, the aim 
of the present study was to examine the efficacy and safety of dronabinol  vs placebo in adults 
with trichotillomania  or skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221619] a double -blind, placebo -controlled design .

We hypothesize that dronabinol  will be more effective than placebo in reducing the 
frequency of hair pulling and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_863624] 10 weeks of treatment when compared to baseline.  
 
Primary Aim/Objective  
 
The aim of the present st udy is to examine the efficacy and safety of dronabinol  vs 
placebo in adults with trichotillomania  and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221614] . 
 
Co-Primary Endpoint(s):  
The co -primary efficacy measures will be the change in hair pulling or skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_863625]  (for TTM) or Skin Pi[INVESTIGATOR_221629] (for SPD) ,  reliable and valid clinician -administered  measure s (18-
19), as well as the same scale modified for skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221614], and the change in psychosocial 
functioning over the same time period using the Sheehan Disability Scale ( 20). The co -primary 
efficacy end points will be the change in these measures from baseli ne to week 10. 
 
Secondary Aim/Objective  
 
A secondary aim of the study is to examine the effects of dronabinol  vs placebo on self-
report measure s of hair pulling,  skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_41875],  quality of life, and measures of mood and anxiety . 
 
Secondary Endpoint(s):  
Seco ndary efficacy measures include the  change in number of days per week pulling, the 
Clinical Global Impressions –Improvement Scale (CGI -I) rated global improvement of symptoms 
over time (results will be dichotomized as improved [CGI -I ratings of 1 or 2 very much/much 
improved] or not improved [CGI -I ratings of 3 -7]) (20), the self -report  [LOCATION_005] General 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221628] (22), the Skin Pi[INVESTIGATOR_863626], the Quality of 
Life Inventory  (23), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (24), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating 
Scale  (25), and the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire  
 
 
Methodology  
 
50 individuals with trichotillomania or skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221625] a 
double -blind, placebo -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_863627] l or placebo is administered in a 
1:[ADDRESS_1204267] four weeks and every 3 weeks for the remainder of 
the 10-week period.  
 
Participants will be started at 5mg po qday for 2 weeks, then 5mg po bid for 2 weeks and 
then 5mg TID for the remaining 6 weeks.  Participants will only go up to the full dose if clinically 
needed.  Efficacy and safety measures will be performed at each visit.   
                                                                                                                      
 5  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on 
Harmonization Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, all local ethical and legal requiremen ts, and 
the World Medical Assembly (Declaration of Helsinki). The study protocol and procedures will 
be approved by [CONTACT_161615]’s institutional review board prior to any recruitment. 
Written informed consent will be required for study partici pation.  
 
 Randomization of drug will be conducted in blocks of eight .  The blind will be assessable 
to the study subject at all times by [CONTACT_863638].   
The investigational  pharmacy will follow proper accountab ility procedures in regards to both 
randomization of the study drug and holding of the blind.

Baseline Assessments:   
Those subjects who appear appropriate for the study, based on telephone screening, will 
be invited for a baseline assessment. The duration of the baseline assess ment will be 
approximately 90 minutes and will include the following: informed consent, demographic data, 
concomitant medications (no psychotropic medications will be allowed), and family history data . 
There will also be a physical examination  (including  weight, and vital signs, urine pregnancy test 
for women of childbearing years and urine drug screen, as well as  a baseline blood draw to 
assess nutritional status . The blood draw is optional to the subject and will  administered at the 
PI’s discretion ). Fina lly, the subjects will undergo  a psychiatric evaluation (using the MINI 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview).  
In addition, t he following instruments will be completed at the screening visit: 1) NIMH 
Trichotillomania Symptom Severity Scale  (or the sam e scale modified for skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_41875]) ; 2) 
Sheehan Disability Scale; 3) [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221628] ; 4) the 17 -item

Assessment Measure (BFRB -BAM), a new scale being added for validation purposes . In 
addition, subjects will undergo cognitive assessments at baseline and study endpoint.  
Cognitive Assessments:  Assessme nts of cognitive control will be comprised of  several valid 
paradigms (See below ). These tasks are designed to probe dissociable neural circuitry and 
cognitive processes likely to be implicated in the pathophysiology of addictions. Task o rder was 
chosen ar bitrarily and will be applied consistently across subjects, to minimize possible 
confounding factors of differences in task order across participants.  
 The following tasks will be administered at baseline and final visits:  
  -Stop Signal Task of Inhibitory  Control  (SST)  
  -Intra-dimensional/Extra -dimensional Set Shift Task (ID/ED task)  
  -One Touch Stockings  Task  (OTS)  
  -Rapid Visual Processing Task  (RVP)  
  -Spatial Working Memory Task  (SWM)  
  -Cambridge Gambling Task  (CGT)  
 
Following -Up Visit Assessments  
All follow -up visits will include all psychiatric measures (except the MINI which will be 
done at baseline only) and safety measures (adverse events, vital signs, C -SSRS).  There will be 
four follow up visits for a total of five visits.  
 
Subject Compensatio n 
Subjects will be compensated  $20 per visit, for a total of $100. Compensation will be given in 
the form of a check at the end of the study, as per University of Chicago protocol.  
 
Safety Assessments  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed using spontane ously reported adverse events data, 
Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS ), vital signs, and by [CONTACT_863639]. Safety assessments (C -SSRS, sitting blood pressure, heart rate, adverse effects, and 
concomitant medications) will be  documented at each visit. Subjects who are an immediate 
suicide risk will be removed from the study and appropriate clinical intervention (e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be arranged. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at the initial visit. 
Subjects who h ave a positive urine pregnancy test will be excluded from the study. Assessment 
of side effects will be done at each visit. AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Med - DRA) 
Version11.1. The incidences of all AEs will be summarized descriptively.  In terms of vital signs, 
those subjects with abnormal blood pressures will be assessed for symptoms of hypo - or 
hypertension. Asymptomatic subjects will be evaluated each visit fo r changes in vital signs. In 
the case of hypertensive emergencies (BP greater than 210/120), appropriate referral to the 
emergency room will be made. In the case of hypotension (BP less than 90/60), participants will 
be evaluated for symptoms of hypotensio n and if symptomatic, appropriate interventions will be 
made.  
                                                                                                                      
 [ADDRESS_1204268] a healthcare 
provider immediately if they experience a seizure . 
Although the seizure risk needs to be taken seriously, the occurrence of new seizures 
from dronabinol, when exclu ding patients with a seizure disorder, appears to be fairly low even 
in medically compromised patient ( 25). In the proposed study, our dose of dronabinol is only up 
to a total of 15mg each day and patients with trichotillomania are on average quite healthy . This 
may explain why we saw only a small amount of mild side effects in our previous study ( 4).

and chemotherapy -related nausea as well as not medically compromised sub jects with 
trichotillomania ( 4).

Subject Withdrawal  
If a subject withdraws from the study, all instr uments administered at the screening visit 
will be completed at the final visit.  These will be conducted when the subject is able to come in 
for an early termination visit.  Withdrawn subjects will be given the phone number of the 
principal investigator a s well as the phone numbers of local resources for trichotillomania  and 
skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_41875] .

 A number of elements of the research plan are intended to minimize the risks of 
study participation. If subjects become actively suicidal with intent and plan to 
kill themselves, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_221632] -study 
treatment. Any participant endorsing suicidal thoughts with intent and plan will be  
immediately evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_161602] a higher level of care if clinically 
indicated.  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_221633], as 
such issues arise. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_863628] a written report summarizing any 
decisions that are made pertaining to participant disposition.  
 Data integrity and confidentiality will be safeguarded as discussed above in the 
Data Management and Statistic al Analysis section under Research Methods.  
 
Monitoring Committee  
We will establish a monitoring committee and define in detail its role, its composition, and its 
operating procedures for reviewing patient safety and data from this study.  The monitoring 
committee , comprised of three  individuals independent of personnel involved in the study, 
                                                                                                                      
 [ADDRESS_1204269] s and a statistician, will come together via conference call yearly. The 
committee will use a standardized approach employing contemporary bio  statistical, 
psychiatric/psychological, and ethical principles to review study design and interim data every 
year. The committee will audit the records from the study and will ensure the data are being 
collected, managed and protected. The committee will have the ability to ask for more frequent 
reviews at any time if they deem it necessary. In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_863629].  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_58601] a specific report for the committee in advance of each meeting. Attent ion 
will be given to data quality and timeliness, recruitment, risk versus benefit, adverse events and 
other factors that could affect study outcome.  
3. Reporting Adverse Events  
 Any serious adverse event will be reported to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) at the University of Chicago in a full written report within 10 working days 
of the event. For fatal/life -threatening serious adverse events, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_221636].  
 Any moderate adverse event which appears definitely, pro bably, or possibly 
related to study participation will be reported to the University of Chicago IRB in 
writing within 20 working days.  
 Any mild adverse event will be summarized in the IRB annual progress reports.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
 
Design/Randomization  
The study is a double -blind, placebo -controlled study.  Participants will be randomized (1:1) to 
receive dronabinol  or placebo by [CONTACT_221650], using computer -generated randomization with no cli nical information.  
 
Due to the pandemic of COVID19, study participants can perform their baseline and follow -up 
visits online using encrypted Zoom instead of in person visits. All inventories will be assessed. 
Blood samples and urine toxicology, however, will be at the discretion of the study PI. In cases 
where they are considered medically necessary, the participant can have them drawn locally and 
submitted to the study team.  
 
Efficacy Analysis  
For statistical analysis, the full -analysis set will be defin ed as all participants who took at least [ADDRESS_1204270]-randomization safety assessment.  Participants with 
trichotillomania and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_863630].  
 
We will compare the baseline characteristics of both groups using Fisher’s exact test for 
categorical va riables and the t test for continuous variables. We will calculate adherence to 
treatment, based on the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_221638], as the number of  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_221639] × 100%.  
 
Primary endpoint analysis  
                                                                                                                      
 [ADDRESS_1204271] randomization visit to study 
endpoint in total composite score on the NIMH Trichotillomania Symptom Severity Scale (s) and 
the Sheehan Disability Scale .  
 
The primary analysis of efficacy for continuous m easures will be analysis of variance (ANOVA), 
with terms for treatment to assess differences between treatment groups in the change from  first 
randomization visit  to endpoint using the last observation carried forward. The primary  analysis 
for global impro vement and response categories will be the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test using 
the last observation carried forward. The primary analysis for ≥5% reduction in weight will be 
Fisher’s exact test using the last observation carried forward.  
 
Secondary endpoin ts analyses  
Secondary outcome measures will include the change from first randomization visit to study 
endpoint in CGI severity and improvement scales, self-reported hair pulling behavior using the 
MGH -HPS, self-reported skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_863631]-SAS,  the change in depressive and 
anxiety symptoms , change in quality of life , and impacts on personality markers . We wil l use a 
longitudinal analysis comparing the rate of change of the outcome during the treatment period 
between groups. The difference in  rate of change will be estimated by [CONTACT_221651].  The model for the mean of the outcome will include terms for treatment, time, and 
treatment -by-time interaction. To account for the correlation of observations within participants, 
we will us e SAS procedure MIXED with a first -order antedependence covariance structure. The 
longitudinal analyses will use all available observations from all time points from all participants 
who completed a randomization visit evaluati on.  
 
Safety analyses  
We will  evaluate differences between groups in the incidence of treatment -emergent adverse 
events using Fisher’s exact test. Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate changes in 
laboratory values, blood pressure and heart rate.  
 
Sample Size  
The sample size  was calculated for the co-primary endpoint of change from randomization . For 
80% power to compare the change from randomization , assuming a true effect size of 0. [ADDRESS_1204272] of demographic data, subjective (self -report questionnaires, interview 
responses, ratings), and physiological (weight, heart rate and blood pressure). Access to 
individually identifiable private information about human subjects will be limited to [CONTACT_126825] 
and their staff and will be collected specifically for the proposed research project. All collected 
data will be stored utilizing a [ADDRESS_1204273] been estimated to be 
approximately 3:1 (female:male).   We will also make every effort to include a racially/ethnically 
diverse study population. The year 2 010 Chicago census is 2,695,598 (US Census Bureau, 2011). 
The year 2010 Chicago race distribution is as follows: white 47.1%, African/African -American 
33.9%, Asian/Asian -American 6.2%, Native American 1.0%, or other race/not identified 
(11.8%). A total of 28.9% of the population also identified as Hispanic/Latino allowing for a 
diverse population sample (year 2010, US Census Bureau, Chicago, IL). We will make every 
effort to ensure that members of both genders and diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic 
groups are adequately represented in the proposed study.

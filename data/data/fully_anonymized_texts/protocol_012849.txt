Title: A Long-term Safety Study of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (Btk) 
Inhibitor PCI-[ZIP_CODE] in B Cell Lymphoma and Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia 
Protocol number: PCYC-1103-CA 
Phase: Not applicable 
Indication: B cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
Study drug and 
comparator: PCI-[ADDRESS_35789] Gelatin Ca psule (referred to as PCI-[ZIP_CODE]) 
No comparator is used in this study.  
Objectives: The primary objective is to determine the long-term (> 6 months) safety and tolerability of a fixed daily dosing regimen of PCI-[ZIP_CODE].   
Study design: This is an open-label, monotherapy, multicenter, extension study open to subjects meeting requirements for roll over from their 
parent protocol and want to continue receiving study drug.  
Subjects from PCYC-[ZIP_CODE] who had disease progression may 
enroll in this study at a higher dose level of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (not to exceed 840 mg/day) than dose level in PCYC-[ZIP_CODE] study. 
Subjects enrolled in this study will receive once daily dosing with 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] at the same dose level they were receiving in the parent 
study.  One cycle is 28 days.  Treatment may be continued as long 
as there is no evidence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.   
Safety and efficacy assessments w ill be performed at a minimum 
of every 3 cycles.  At each visit, adverse events (AEs) of Grade [ADDRESS_35790] and ongoing AEs from parent protocol will be recorded.  All serious adverse events (SAEs) must be recorded.  Efficacy assessments will be performed in  accordance with the Guidelines 
for the Diagnosis and Treatment of CLL
9 (Appendix 4), 
International Working Group Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma
10 (Appendix 5 ), and Waldenström's 
Macroglobulinemia (WM)11 (Appendix 6).  If signs and symptom s 
provide evidence of progressive disease (PD), PD must be confirmed by [CONTACT_4654].  
Upon discontinuation of study treatment, a Safety Follow-up Visit 
(SFU) will be performed prior to the start of a new anticancer therapy or approximately 30 (±7) days after the last dose of study drug, whichever occurs first.  If a subject discontinues treatment for reasons other than disease progression, response assessments 
will be continued approximately every [ADDRESS_35791]: PCI-[ADDRESS_35792] blood samples for pharmacodynamics and 
pharmacokinetics analyses (e.g., Btk occupancy and B cell activation) (refer to Section 6.1.)

 1.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Note: for more detailed and comprehensive background information please refer to the 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] Investigator's Brochure (IB). 
1.[ADDRESS_35797] NAME [CONTACT_36112]-[ZIP_CODE] (ibrutinib) is a first-in-class, potent, or all
y administered covalently-binding inhibitor 
of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK).  Inhibition of BTK blocks downstream B-cell receptor (BCR) 
signaling pathways and thus prevents B-cell prolifer ation.  In vitro, PCI-[ZIP_CODE] inhibits purified 
BTK and selected members of the kinase family w ith 10-fold specificity compared with non-BTK 
kinases.  PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (IMBRUVICA®; ibrutinib) is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of: 1) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in patients who have received at least one prior therapy, 2) chronic ly mphocytic leukemia (CLL) in patients who have 
received at least one prior therapy, 3) CLL in patients with 17p deletion, and  4) Waldenstr ӧm’s 
Macroglobulinemia .  PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is currently under investigation in various indications as a single 
agent and in combinations.   
B cells are lymphocytes with multiple functions  in the immune response, including antigen 
presentation, antibody production, and cytokine release.  B cells express cell surface 
immunoglobulins comprising the B-cell receptor (BCR), which is activated by [CONTACT_14178].  Antigen binding induces receptor aggregation a nd the clustering and activation of multiple 
tyrosine kinases, which in turn activate further downstream signaling pathways.

IND No. 102,688 Protocol PCYC-1103-CA Amendment 5 14 May 2015 
 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential Page 12 of 58 Data from Study PCYC-[ZIP_CODE] demonstrate that a lthough PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_36062], once daily dosing with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is adequate to sustain 
maximal pharmacodynamic activity for 24 hours postdose at dose levels ≥2.5 mg/kg. In Study 
PCYC-[ZIP_CODE], the BTK occupancies for the 2.5 mg/kg/day to 12.5 mg/kg/day cohorts and for the 
560 mg continuous dosing cohort, were all a bove 90% at either [ADDRESS_35799] version of the PCI-[ZIP_CODE] IB. 
1.2 BRUTON’S TYROSINE KINASE AND LYMPHOMA 
Several lines of evidence suggest that signa ling through the BCR is necessary to sustain 
the viability of B cell ma lig
nancies.  First,  expression of a functional BCR is maintained 
throughout lymphoma progression even as the non-expressed immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) 
is involved in oncogenic translocations and despi[INVESTIGATOR_36063]-
idiotype therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].2,[ADDRESS_35800] 2 drugs that target BCR signaling (the 
Syk inhibitor, R788, and the PKC β inhibitor, enzastaurin) have shown evidence of anti-tumor 
effects in human B cell lymphomas.7 
1.3 SUMMARY OF RELEVANT NONCLINICAL AND CLINICAL DATA 
1.3.1 Pharmacology  
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] was designed as a selective and covalently-binding inhibitor of th
e Btk protein.8  In 
vitro, PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is a potent inhibitor of Btk activity (IC 50 = 0.39 nM).  The irreversible binding 
of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] to cysteine-481 in the active site of Btk results in sustained inhibition of Btk catalytic activity and enhanced selectivity over other kinases that do not contain a cysteine at this position.  When added directly to human whol e blood, PCI-[ZIP_CODE] inhibits signal transduction 
from the B-cell receptor and blocks primary B-cell activation (IC
50 = 80 nM) as assayed by [CONTACT_14181]-
IgM stimulation followed by [CONTACT_398]69 expression.[ADDRESS_35801]: PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 
IND No. 102,688 Protocol PCYC-1103-CA Amendment 5 14 May 2015 
 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential Page 13 of 58 PCI-[ZIP_CODE] arrested cell growth and induced a poptosis in human B cell lymphoma cell lines in 
vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo in xeno graft models.  In mice, tumor growth inhibition 
was demonstrated at dose levels where no overt  toxicity was observed, as measured by [CONTACT_36080] (BWs).  In addition, PCI-[ZIP_CODE] was e fficacious in a mouse model of collagen-induced 
arthritis, a disease whose pathogenesis involves B cell activation. 
Binding of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] to the active site of Btk (Btk occupancy) was demonstrated in vivo in rat 
and dog blood mononuclear cells, mouse splenoc ytes, and xenograft tumor cells using a 
pharmacodynamic assay, which uses a specially designed Btk-binding fluorescent probe.  The 
probe binds irreversibly to the active site of Btk, enabling fluorescent detection of labeled Btk 
protein.  The presence of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] bound to the Btk active site occludes probe binding thus reducing the fluorescence probe signal.  In mice, 50%  of the Btk active sites in splenocytes were 
occupi[INVESTIGATOR_530] 3 hours after a single oral dose of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] at 5 mg/kg.  Mice orally administered PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 30 mg/kg had complete Btk active-site  occupancy in splenocytes, which persisted 
about [ADDRESS_35802] dose.  In dogs, a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg resulted in complete occupancy of Btk measured in PBMCs.  The complete occupancy persisted for ≥ [ADDRESS_35803] dose. PCI-[ZIP_CODE] adde d to human blood (ex vivo) leads to complete 
Btk occupancy (IC
50 = 100 nM) and inhibition of B cell ac tivation measured by [CONTACT_398]69 expression. 
1.3.2 Toxicology  
In safety
 pharmacology assessments, no treatment-re lated effects were observed in the central 
nervous system or respi[INVESTIGATOR_14128].  Further, no treatment-related 
corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation effect was observed at any tested dose in a cardiovascular study using telemetry-monitored dogs.   
Based on data from rat and dog in cluding general toxicity studies up to [ADDRESS_35804] potential for human toxicity with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is predicted to be in lymphoid tissues 
(lymphoid depletion) and the gastrointestinal tract (soft feces/diarrhea with or without inflammation).  Additional toxicity findings seen in only one species with no observed human 
correlate in clinical studies to date include pancreatic acinar cell atrophy (rat), minimally 
decreased trabecular and cortical bone (rat) and corneal dystrophy (dog).   
In vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies showed that PCI-[ADDRESS_35805] ration was associated with fetal loss and 
malformations (teratogenicity) at PCI-[ZIP_CODE] doses that result in approximately 6 times and 
14 times the exposure (AUC) in patients administer ed the dose of [ADDRESS_35806]: PCI-[ZIP_CODE]

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential Page 14 of 58 [IP_ADDRESS]  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
Carcinogenicity studies ha
ve not been conducted with PCI-[ZIP_CODE]. 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in a 
chromosome aberration assay in mammalian (CHO) cells, nor was it clastogenic in an in vivo 
bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice at doses up to 2000 mg/kg. 
Fertility studies with PCI-[ADDRESS_35807] Metabolism 
Following 
oral administration of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] at doses ranging from 1.25 to 12.5 mg/kg/day as well 
as fixed dose levels of 420, 560, and 840 mg /day, exposure to PCI-[ADDRESS_35808] variability.  The mean half life (t 1/2) of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] across 
3 clinical studies ranged from 4 to 9 hours, with a median time to maximum plasma concentration 
(Tmax) of [ADDRESS_35809] in subjects with 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) approximately doubled the mean systemic exposure 
compared to intake after overnight fasting with median time to T max delayed from [ADDRESS_35810] dose exposure. 
The results of human mass balance study of [
14C]-PCI-[ZIP_CODE] conducted in six healthy male 
subjects demonstrated that less than 10% of the total dose of [14C]-PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is renally excreted, 
whereas approximately 80% is recovered in f eces.  Subjects with mild and moderate renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance >30 mL/min) were eligible to enroll in Study PCYC-1102-CA 
in which pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments were in cluded.  No dose adjustment is needed for 
mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance).  There is no 
data in patients with severe renal impairment or  patients on dialysis.  In a hepatic impairment 
study, data showed an increase in PCI-3276 exposu re.  Following single dose administration, the 
AUC of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] increased 2.7-, 8.2-, and 9.8-fold in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), 
moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment compared to 
subjects with normal liver function.  The safety of PCI-[ADDRESS_35811]: PCI-[ZIP_CODE]

results in a mobilization of tumor cells to the peripheral blood.21   
A reversible increase in lymphocyte counts (ie, ≥50% increase from baseline and above absolute 
count 5,000/µL), often associated with reduction of lymphadenopathy has been observed in most 
subjects (approximately 69% to 75%) with CLL/ SLL treated with single agent PCI-[ZIP_CODE].  This 
effect has also been observed in some subjects (33%) with MCL treated with single agent 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE].  This observed transient lymphocytosis is a pharmacodynamic effect and should not be considered progressive disease in the absence of other clinical findings.  In both disease types, 
lymphocytosis typi[INVESTIGATOR_36064] (median time 1.1 weeks) of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 
therapy and typi[INVESTIGATOR_36065] a medi an of 8.0 weeks in subjects with MCL and

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential Page 17 of 58 Lymphocytosis appeared to occur in lower inci dence and at lesser magnitude in subjects with 
CLL/SLL receiving PCI-[ZIP_CODE] in combination with  chemoimmunotherapy (ie, 27% of subjects 
receiving ibrutinib + bendamustine + rituximab (BR)  in Study 1108) or immunotherapy (ie, 55% 
of subjects receiving ibrutinib + ofatumumab in Group 2 of Study 1109).  
A substantial increase in the number of circul ating lymphocytes (eg, >400,000/µL) has been 
observed in a subset of subjects.  There have been isolated cases of leukostasis reported in 
subjects treated with PCI-[ZIP_CODE].

T ON COMPLIANCE 
This study  wi
ll be conducted in compliance with this protocol, principles of International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) GCP, Declaratio n of Helsinki, and all applicable national 
and local regulations governing clinical studies. 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term safety of a fixed-dose, daily regimen of 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] at dose levels up to 840 mg/day in subjects with B cell lymphoma (including, but not 
limited to, CLL/SLL, Waldenström's macroglobu linemia [WM], mantle cell lymphoma [MCL], 
diffuse large B cell lymphoma [DLBCL], and follicular lymphoma [FL]). 
The primary objective is to determine the long-term (>6 months) safety and tolerability of a fixed 
daily dosing regimen of PCI-[ZIP_CODE].   
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY 
This is an open-label, m onotherapy
, multicente r, extension study open to subjects from prior 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] studies who meet eligibility criteria.  Th is is an open-label study; as such, no blinding 
measures will be taken.   
Subject participation will include a Screening Ph ase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up Phase.   
The Screening Phase will be the last Treatment Phase of the parent protocol.  Subjects will 
complete all safety and efficacy assessments require d by [CONTACT_36081], and roll over to this 
extension study to ensure no interruption of treatment with PCI-[ZIP_CODE]. 
The Treatment Phase will extend from the first dose until study drug discont inuation under this 
protocol.  Subjects roll over from PCI-[ADDRESS_35817] was receiving in the parent study until disease progression.  Please note that if 
the clinical risk benefit ratio favors continuing  PCI-[ZIP_CODE] for a brief period of time (e.g. up to 
4 weeks) while salvage anticancer therapy is a rranged that this may be considered at the 
Investigators discretion.  Regularly scheduled safety and efficacy assessments are required throughout the Treatment Phase.  Furthe r information on dosing is provided in  Section 5.3.

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential Page 20 of 58 The Follow-up Phase will comprise of 2 phases;  a Post-treatment Phase and a Post-disease 
Progression Phase.  The Post-treatment Phase will extend from the discontinuation of treatment up 
until the subject has PD or other criteria listed in Section 4.3.  A Safety Follow-Up Visit (SFU) 
will be performed prior to t
he start of a new anticancer therapy or 30 (±7) days after the last dose 
of study drug, whichever occurs first.  If a s ubject discontinues treatment for reasons other than 
disease progression, response assessments will be  continued every [ADDRESS_35818] survival status should be 
performed once every 3 months.   
This study will be monitored in accordance w ith the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Committee

5.3 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTR ATION OF PCI-3 2765 
Subjects will receive daily administration of a fixed dose of PCI-[ZIP_CODE].  Subjects will continue 
treatment at the same dose level as in the parent study (up to 840 mg) daily.  Subjects whose dose 
level was previously determined on the basis of weight (PCYC-[ZIP_CODE]) will receive a fixed dose 
of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (not to exceed 840 mg/day) that is  comparable to their prior weight-based dose 
level.  PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is intended to  be administered orally once daily with 8 ounces (approximately 
240 mL) of water. Avoid grapefruit juice or Seville oranges due to CYP3A inhibition.  The capsules should be swallowed intact and subjects should not attempt to open capsules or dissolve 
them in water.   
Product: PCI-[ADDRESS_35825] until the next visit should be dispensed.  
Unused PCI-[ZIP_CODE] capsules dispensed during previous visits and all empty bottles should be 
returned and drug accountability records ( Section 9.8) updated according to the schedule in 
Appendix [ADDRESS_35826] diary will be used to aid with study drug administration compliance.  Investigators are 
prohibited from supplying PCI-[ZIP_CODE] to any subjects not properly enrolled in this study or to any 
physicians or scientists except those designa ted as sub-investigators on form Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) 1572.  The investigator must ensure that subjects receive PCI-[ZIP_CODE] only 
from personnel who fully understand the pr ocedures for administering the drug.  
5.4 CRITERIA FOR ADJUSTING STUDY DRUG DOSAGE 
5.4.1 Dose Delay 
Treatment with PCI-327 65 should be hel d
 for any unmanageable, potentially study drug-related 
toxicity that is Grade 3 or higher in severity.  Subjects who require anticoagulant treatment (e.g., heparin and/or warfarin) should have study drug held until stabilized on anticoagulant therapy.  
Study drug may be held for a maximum of 28 co nsecutive days for toxicity.  Study treatment 
should be discontinued in the event of a toxicity  lasting > 28 days, unless reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_7195]. 
5.4.2 Dose Reduction and Discontinuation 
At the discret ion of the investigator, based upon the r ecent FDA ap
provals of IMBRUVICA® 
(PCI-[ZIP_CODE]) for the treatment of MCL and CLL af ter having received at least one prior therapy 
and for the treatment of WM, subjects may have  their PCI-[ZIP_CODE] dose reduced to the approved 
dosage in the absence of toxicity.  Any subsequent dose modifications below the approved label 
dose should follow the dose modification guidelines per protocol for toxicity.  
The actions in Table 1  should be taken for the following toxicities:  
• Grade 4 ANC (< 500/µL) for > 7 da y
s (neutrophil growth factors are permitted per 
ASCO guidelines [ADDRESS_35827] be recorded in CRF).

• Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, if  persistent despi[INVESTIGATOR_36067]/or 
anti-diarrheal therapy. 
• Any other Grade 4 toxicity or any unmanageable Grade 3 toxicity. 
For Grade 3 or 4 atrial fibrillation or persistent atrial fibrillation of any grade, consider the risks 
and benefits of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] treatment.  If clini cally indicated, the use of anticoagulants or 
antiplatelet agents may be considered for the thromboprophylaxis of atrial fibrillation 
(Section 5.6.4 ).

5.4.4 Dose Modification for He patic Impaired Subjects 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE]  is metabolized in the liver.  F
or subj ects who develop mild liver impairment while on 
study (Child-Pugh class A), the recommended dose reduction for PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is to a level of 
280 mg daily (two capsules).  For subjects who develop moderate liver impairment while on 
study (Child-Pugh class B), the recommended dose reduc tion is to a level of 140 mg daily (one 
capsule).  Subjects who develop severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) must hold study 
drug until resolved to moderate impairment (Child -Pugh class B) or better and could be re-treated 
according to resolved hepatic conditions (ie, 140 mg or 280 mg for moderate or mild impairment, respectively).  Monitor subjects for signs of toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as 
needed  Appendix 7.  
5.[ADDRESS_35832] supportive care medications are 
permitted.  Use of neutrophil growth factors (f ilgrastim and pegfilgrastim) or red blood cell 
growth factors (erythropoietin) is permitted pe r the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
(ASCO) guidelines16.  Transfusions may be given in acco rdance with institutional policy.  
Short courses ( ≤14 days) of steroid treatment for non-cancer related medical reasons (e.g., joint

PCI-[ADDRESS_35834], of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] by 29- and 24-fold, respectively.  The 
maximal observed PCI-[ZIP_CODE] exposure (AUC) was ≤2-fold in 37 patients treated with mild 
and/or moderate CYP3A inhibitors when compared with the highest PCI-[ZIP_CODE] exposure in 
76 patients not treated concomitantly with CYP3A i nhibitors.  Clinical safety data in 66 patients 
treated with moderate (n=47) or strong CYP3A inhibitors (n=19) did not reveal meaningful 
increases in toxicities.  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, and nefazadone) should be 
avoided.  If a strong CYP3A inhibitor must be used, reduce the PCI-[ADDRESS_35835] be used, redu ce PCI-[ZIP_CODE] to 140 mg for the duration of the 
inhibitor use.  No dose adjustment is required  in combination with mild inhibitors.  Avoid 
grapefruit and Seville oranges during PCI-[ZIP_CODE] treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors 
of CYP3A (see Section 5.3). 
Co-ad ministration of PCI-
[ZIP_CODE] with a strong CYP3A inducer, rifampin, in healthy subjects 
decreases PCI-[ZIP_CODE] plasma concentrations by [CONTACT_36084] 10-fold.  Avoid concomitant use of 
strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort).  Consider alternative agents  with less CYP3A induction. 
A list of common CYP3A inhibitors and inducers is provided in Appendix 2; a comp rehensiv

response with l
ymphocytosis (PRL), stable di sease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) based on 
the guidelines of each histology (refer to Appendix 4 , Appendix 5 , and Appendix 6 ).  The 
response assessments will be performed once ev ery 3 cycles (±7 days) during the Treatment 
Phase.  All responses must be maintained for at l east [ADDRESS_35862]: PCI-[ADDRESS_35863]’s first dose of study 
drug in the parent study, then every 6 cycles up to cycle 36, then every 12 cycles (annually) 
thereafter.   
• Progressive Disease (PDs) must be confirmed by [CONTACT_3610].  
• Complete responses (CRs) must be confirmed by [CONTACT_36087]/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  For 
subjects who obtain complete response (CR) , subsequent scans are only required to 
confirm disease progression. 
6.3 FOLLOW-UP PHASE 
After study  Treatment Phase is co m
pleted, a ll subjects will enter the Follow-up Phase.  The 
Follow-up Phase will comprise of the following:  
• Safety Follow-up Visit  
• Post-treatment Phase  
• Post-disease Progression Phase   
6.3.1 Safety Follow-up Visit 
The Safety Fo llow-up Visi
t will be conducted prior to the start of a new anticancer treatment or 
30 (±7) days after the last PCI-[ADDRESS_35864], to monitor for ongoing AEs 
(refer to Section 7.0) and to document the occurrence of any new AEs.  The Schedule of 
Assess ments ( Appendix 3
) describes the procedures required for the Safety Follow-up Visits. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_35865] 
has progressive disease or other criteria listed in Section 4.3.  Subjects will be followed 
approxima tel
y every 3 months (±7 days) for disease progression and initiation of any subsequent 
anticancer therapy. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_35866] for survival  status (including cause of death) by [CONTACT_36088], as well as collection of subsequent anticancer therapy once every 3 months 
(±7 days) until the end of study.   
6.4 MISSED EVALUATIONS 
Missed evaluations should be rescheduled and perfo rmed as close 
to the original scheduled date 
as possible.  An exception is made when rescheduling becomes, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649],

7.[ADDRESS_35868] a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (i ncluding an abnormal laboratory finding, for 
example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
For the purposes of this clinical study, AEs include only grade [ADDRESS_35869] (see 
protocol Section 7.2.4).   
The following are exceptions that will be collected as AE’s regardless of severit y grade:  
 
• AE leading to dose reduction  
• AE leading to treatment discontinuation  
• SAE  
• Other malignancies 
• Eye-related adverse events Grade 2 or higher 
Disease progression is not an adverse event; rather it may be the cause of an adverse event.  Adverse events that occur due to disease progression must be reported as all other treatment-emergent adverse events.  “Disease progression” should never be an adverse event term. 
Adverse events may include, but are not limited to: 
• Subjective or objective symptoms provided by [CONTACT_3184]/or observed by [CONTACT_36089]. 
• Any AEs experienced by [CONTACT_36090] [ADDRESS_35870] dose of study drug. 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with the underlying disease that 
were not present before the AE reporting period (refer to Section 7.2.1).

Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential Page 35 of 58 • Complications that occur as a result of prot ocol-mandated interventions (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies). 
The following are NOT considered an AE: 
• Pre-existing condition:  A pre-existing condition (documented on the medical history 
case report form [CRF]) is not considered an AE unless the severity, frequency, or 
character of the event wor sens during the study period. 
• Preplanned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14147], but rather a therapeutic intervention.  
However, if during the pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14148], which prolongs the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14149], the event will be considered an SAE.  
Surgeries or interventions that were unde r consideration but not performed before 
enrollment in the study will not be consid ered serious if they are performed after 
enrollment in the study for a condition that has not changed from its baseline level.  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14150], solely for the administration of chemotherapy, or due to long travel distances are also not SAEs. 
• Diagnostic Testing and Procedures:  Testing and procedures s hould not to be reported 
as AEs or SAEs, but rather the cause for the test or procedure should be reported. 
• Asymptomatic Treatment-Related Lymphocytosis: This event should also not be 
considered an AE.  Subjects with treatme nt-related lymphocytos is should remain on 
study treatment and continue with all study-related procedures.   
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event 
The ter
ms “severe”  and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity (or intensity) refers to the grade 
of an AE (see below). “Serious” is a regulatory definition.  
An SAE (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death) 
• is life-threatening (“life-threatening” is define d as an AE in which the subject was at risk 
of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe. If e ither the investigator or the Sponsor believes 
that an AE meets the definition of life-threat ening, it will be considered life-threatening.) 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] >24 hours or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• is an important medical event that may not result in death, be immediately life-threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered an SAE when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient, or patient may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsion that does not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of  drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Product: PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 
IND No. 102,688 Protocol PCYC-1103-CA Amendment 5 14 May 2015 
 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential Page 36 of 58 Given that the investigator’s perspective may be informed by [CONTACT_36091], 
and the Sponsor is likely to have broader knowledge of the drug and its effects to inform its 
evaluation of the significance of the event, if either the Sponsor or the investigator believes that 
the event is serious, the event will be considered serious. 
7.1.3 Severity 
Definitions found i
n the Common Terminology Criteria for Adve rse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 will 
be used for grading the severity (intensity) of AEs.  The CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_35871] 
experience any AE not listed in the CTCAE v4.03, the following grading system should be used to assess severity: 
• Grade 1 (Mild AE) – experiences which are usually transient, requiring no special 
treatment, and not interfering with the subject’s daily activities. 
• Grade 2 (Moderate AE) – experiences which in troduce some level of inconvenience or 
concern to the subject, and which may interfe re with daily activities, but are usually 
ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212]. 
• Grade 3 (Severe AE) – experiences which are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly 
interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity, and require systemic drug therapy or other 
treatment. 
• Grade 4 (Life-threatening or disabling AE) – experiences which cause the subject to be in imminent danger of death. 
• Grade 5 (Death related to AE) – experiences which result in subject death. 
7.1.4 Causality 
The investigator is to assess the causal r
elation (i .e., whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study drug caused the event)  using the following definitions: 
Unrelated: Another cause of the AE is more plausible; a temporal sequence cannot 
be established with the onset of the AE and administration of the investigational product; or, a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible. 
Possibly Related: There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE 
and administration of the investigational product, but the AE could also 
be attributed to concurrent or underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or procedures. Possibly related should be used when the investigational product is one of several biologically plausible AE causes.

IND No. 102,688 Protocol PCYC-1103-CA Amendment 5 14 May 2015 
 
Pharmacyclics, Inc. Proprietary and Confidential Page 37 of 58 Definitely Related: The AE is clearly related to use of the investigational product. 
7.1.5 Unexpected Adverse Events 
An “unexpected” AE is an AE that is not
 listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed.  For example, he patic necrosis would be “unexpected” (by [CONTACT_36092]) if the IB referred only to elev ated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, 
cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be “unexpected” (by [CONTACT_36093]) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular ac cidents.  "Unexpected" also refers to AEs that 
are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the study drug under investigation. 
7.[ADDRESS_35872] dose of study 
drug should also be reported if considered rela ted to study drug.  If an SAE is present at the 
Safety Follow-up Visit, the SAE (and associated  AEs and concomitant medications) should be 
followed to resolution or until the investigator assesses the subject as stable, or the subject is lost 
to follow-up or withdraws consent.  Resolution/st able means the subject h as returned to baseline 
state of health or the investigator does not exp ect any further improvement or worsening of the 
event. 
If a death occurs within [ADDRESS_35873]: PCI-[ADDRESS_35874]’s medical record and on the AE eCRF and, when applicable, on a SAE Worksheet.   
Each recorded AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), severity, 
regulatory seriousness criteria, if applicable, suspected relationship to the investigational product 
(see following guidance), a nd any actions taken. 
7.2.3 Expedited Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs (initial and follow-up inform ation) w
ill be reported on a SAE Worksheet and faxed to 
Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, within  [ADDRESS_35875] follo w-up and other additional information from the 
investigator (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]/discharge notes, laboratory results).  
All deaths should be reported with the primar y cause of death as the AE term, as death is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_36069], not the ev ent itself.  The primary cause of death on the 
autopsy report should be the term reported.  Au topsy and postmortem repor ts must be forwarded 
to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, as outlined above.   
If study drug is discontinued because of an SAE, this information must be included in the SAE 
report. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_35876] safety monitoring activities

a. Screening tests should be performed within [ADDRESS_35903], height (screening only) and weight, and exa mination of the skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, 
extremities, musculoskeletal system, nervous system, and lymphatic system.  Symptom-directed physical examinations will be perf ormed thereafter. 
d. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature) will be assessed.  Screening vital signs and weight do n ot need to be repeated if performed during a prior PCI-[ADDRESS_35904] 
administration of study drug on this protocol.  Subjects who roll into PCYC-1103-CA Study with < [ADDRESS_35905] hematology performed every 30 days (±7 days) till 
completion of 12 months on study drug and then hematology will be extended to every 3 cycles (±7 days) while on study treatment .  
g. Serum chemistry includes glucose, calcium, albumin, total protein, sodium, potassium,  CO 2, chloride, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, and total bilirubin.  
Screening chemistry does not need to be repeated if performed on prior PCI-[ADDRESS_35906] admin istration of study drug on this protocol.  Serum chemistry will be performed 
every 3 cycles while on study treatment. 
h. One cycle is once daily administration for 28 days.  Dispense sufficient study drug until the next scheduled visit. 
i. Objective response will be categorized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease, or progressive disease  based on the guidelines of each histology (refer to Appendix 4, Appendix [ADDRESS_35907] 2 months to be considered confirmed.  
Complete responses (CRs) must be confirmed by [CONTACT_36087]/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  Progressive disease (PD) must be confirmed by [CONTACT_4654]. T o facilitate lymph node, liver, and spleen assessments in subjects, 
obtain a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, every [ADDRESS_35908]’s first dose of stu dy drug in the parent study, then every 6 cycles up to cycle 36, then every 
12 cycles (annually) thereafter.   
j. Verify concomitant medication use to ensure subjects' eligibility to remain on study.  Record concomitant medications at screening visit and when associated with protocol specified AEs and with SAEs.

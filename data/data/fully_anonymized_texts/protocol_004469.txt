 Page [ADDRESS_468690] difficult to treat symptoms in atopic dermatitis 
(AD; eczema). Many children with eczema suffer from a chronic focus (rumination) o n 
itch. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) intervention is effective in treating rumination 
on pain in other chronic diseases, and would likely be successful to treat itch in eczema. 
In this pro ject we will develop an “Itch CBT” intervention specific for i tch rumination in 
eczema. After developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a standard protocol based on input from patients, parents, 
clinicians and the National Eczema Association, we will then pi[INVESTIGATOR_374398]. The total intervention will last approximately one month . 
The intervention will consist of four 60 -minute telehealth  sessions with children and their 
parent/guardian. The first visit will  be done ~60  directly after  a telehealth clinic visit  to 
assess areas of difficulty  followed by  3 weekly telehealth visits  to assess progress and 
implementation, provide further instruction, and review as necessary. At each time -point, 
we will assess how much the intervention decreased itch , improved medication 
adherence, and improved other quality of  life concerns (anxiety, depression, sleep , and 
stigma ). Future directions will include making the Itch CBT protocol widely available 
and securing an NIH grant to broadly test the efficacy.  
 
2.0 Background  
 
Eczema is characterized  by [CONTACT_374415]. M any childre n develop a chronic focus 
(rumination) on their itch. Rumination is a maladaptive method of responding to distress, 
in which the individual thinks obsessively about  the source of distress, its possible causes 
and correlates. The rumination on chronic itch in eczema can have detrimental effects on 
one’s quality of life, as well as induce significant anxiety about when itch will return, 
how long it will last, and how it will affect physical and social functioning.  
 
            Cognitive -behavioral therapy (C BT) is a frontline treatment for rumination, as it 
focuses on teaching strategies so that the individual can examine distressing thoughts 
objectively and determine their validity, replace negative thinking patterns with more 
adaptive thought patterns, and increase the individual’s awareness to their problematic 
thought patterns. Additionally, CBT helps the individual to implement behavioral 
strategies to cope with possibly anxiety -inducing situations, such as scratching while 
trying to go to sleep. Through  behavioral strategies, such as  mindfulness and meditation 
activities , exposure, or  distraction, the individual can learn to function in spi[INVESTIGATOR_374399].  
 
We propose to create a protocol for Itch CBT that focuses on itch rumination  and 
anxiety  in eczema for children ages [ADDRESS_468691] aim was to develop an I tch CBT protocol specific 
for children with eczema. With the input of children with eczema and their families  as to 
the nature of their symptom -related distress , we create d a brief intervention  and 
questionnaire  to measure itch -related distress and ruminat ion and a set of cognitive, 
Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Treat Itch Rumination “Itch CBT” in Eczema  
 Page [ADDRESS_468692]  formalize d a protocol 
for Itch CBT. In our second aim, we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_374400] a brief ( 4 session) 
intervention as part of an interdisciplinary AD clinic, comparing Itch CBT to usual care 
(our standard educational handouts).  
 
Because each group will have similar levels of eczema severity and will be 
receiving the same level of medical care, we will be able to attribute changes over time 
between the two groups  to this mental health intervention. We predict that patients treated 
with Itch CBT will show signi ficantly less itch  and less severe itch , as well as 
significantly greater quality of life, at follow -up compared to those receiving standard 
treatment. Predicted s econdary outcomes include decreased rumination  on itch , sleep 
disturbance, depression, and an xiety, as well as improved  medication adherence, and 
social /family  functioning . This pi[INVESTIGATOR_374401], its 
effects on children with AD, and the efficacy of Itch CBT in itch rumination. With this 
preliminary data, we can apply for NIH funding to provide more extensive evidence for 
the efficacy of Itch CBT in treating itch rumination; ideally we hope to develop an Itch 
CBT protocol that can easily be implemented by [CONTACT_374416] e tool for patients. The National Eczema Association is the perfect 
partner for our research team to help develop and disseminate this intervention.  
 
 
3.0 Hypothesis and Specific Aims  
 
Hypothesis:  Our overall hypothesis is that a brief CBT intervention to trea t itch 
rumination is an effective adjunctive strategy to improve itch in AD.  
 
Aim 1 : Develop and refine a brief, user -friendly, easily deployable CBT intervention to 
treat itch rumination (Itch CBT) for pediatric AD. We will conduct semi -structured 
interv iews of 20 patient/parent dyads to tailor a CBT rumination intervention for itch in 
AD to determine the best cognitive and behavioral strategies to implement in Itch CBT. 
Both open - and close -ended questioning will be used to allow for patient suggestions for 
new material, as well as input on proposed materials and strategies.  
 
Aim 2:  Determine the efficacy of the itch rumination intervention  in reducing distress 
related to AD and itch, as well as correlates of AD that affect quality of life, such as 
social  concerns and sleep disturbance. Preliminary data will also be collected to 
determine the validity of a child and parent -proxy questionnaire designed to measure 
rumination on itch in AD.

 Page 6 of 16  Patients are referred into this clinic through several “recruitment sites.” The diverse racial 
and ethnic demographics are summarized in Table I. The age group is chosen because all 
measures are validated in this age group, and cognitive interventions are  easiest to 
implement in this narrow age group for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Future work would expand to 
younger age groups.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A strength of this application is the volume and diversity of patients seeking treatment at 
the interdisciplinary pediatric allergy/dermatology clinic Lurie Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
allowing for a wide range of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity.  
 
Participants in the active and control conditions will be matched for age, gender, and 
disease severity. All participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_468694] of transportation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are li sted above in the 
previous section . 
 
5.2 Aim 1 Study Design  
Step 1: Conduct Qualitative Interviews to Develop Itch CBT  
The CBT for itch rumination protocol and measure will be derived from 
qualitative (semi -structured) interviews with patients and families with AD from the 
interdisciplinary clinic at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], as well as via 
expert input fr om the study team. Qualitative interviews will be one -on-one with the 
patient and caregiver separately and will begin with open -ended questions to avoid 
biasing the participants with our own preconceptions of their needs. Example questions 
will include “Wh en are you [your child] thinking about the itch most?” and “What would 
help take your mind off the itch?”. After open -ended questions, we will present 
participants with our conceptualization of itch rumination to ensure it accurately reflects 
their experie nces, as well as questions adapted from the PCS -C for itch to determine 
whether these questions accurately reflect their experiences of itch rumination. 
Participants will also be presented with various options and directed questions about their 
preferences  for strategies to cope with itch rumination. Options for discussion will 
include behavioral strategies, such as pleasant activities to distract from the itch; 
cognitive interventions, such as self -questioning to de -escalate catastrophizing the itch 
(e.g. “The itching will never stop” and fears of the itch returning); and relaxation 
strategies, such as progressive muscle relaxation and diaphragmatic breathing when 
distraction is not possible, such as during the night. These strategies are the primary Table I . Racial and Ethnic Demographics of Recruitment Sites

 Page [ADDRESS_468695] been found particularly beneficial in treating physical 
difficulties, such as chronic pain  25.  
 
For Aim 1, 20 patient -parent dyads (40 participants) of children with moderate/severe 
AD will be recruited for qualitative interviewing  with a research assistant to provide 
feedback on the concept of itch rumination and therapeutic techniques to be included in 
CBT for itch rumination. Sample size for the interviews is based on our study team’s 
experience conducting qualitative research in  support of protocol  development and 
clinical health research. To ensure that qualitative findings are representative, research 
must 1) include key characteristics of the population thought to influence the outcomes of 
interest in the study sample; 2) conf irm that the concepts are adequately described by 
[CONTACT_19288]; and 3) bring participants into the study until no new themes, or 
relevant concepts, are obtained.  This point of redundancy is known as theoretical 
saturation  54,55. It has been suggeste d that 20 patient -parent dyads is generally adequate to 
reach saturation  56-58. 
Step 2: Develop and refine the Itch CBT protocol.  
 Qualitative data from Step [ADDRESS_468696] important 
themes in terms of prevalence and/or impact will be identified. These themes, data 
representing the themes in the words of p atients and families, will form the basis for the 
Itch CBT intervention.  
  The study team and key stakeholder (National Eczema Association) will then 
meet and agree to the best protocol to target and address themes related to itch rumination 
generated duri ng qualitative interviews. The result of Aim [ADDRESS_468697] .  
 Based upon the interviews conducted in Aim 1, patients with atopic dermatitis 
reported significant concerns in addition to preoccupation with itch and scratching, 
specifically regarding social difficulties, anxiety, sleep challenges, and difficulty with 
concentration. Thus, the treatment was expanded to address these mult iple areas of 
concern. Additionally, parents of patients reported significant concerns about scheduling 
office appointments because of absences from work and school due to multiple 
appointments for medical providers. For this reason, it was decided that th e primary 
method of intervention would be provided via tele medicine .   
 
Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Treat Itch Rumination “Itch CBT” in Eczema  
 Page 8 of 16  We plan to recruit 24 patient-parent dyads  (48 total participants) stratified by  
[CONTACT_374419]’s  age ( n =6: 8-12, n = 6: 12-17 years) to the CBT itch rumination intervention. 
Usual care will be provided to 1 2 AD patients , matched on gender and itch  severity . Itch 
severity will be based on the NRS Itch Severity score. Potential participants will be 
recruited from Lurie Children’s Dermatology and Allergy Departments. If patients have 
an upcoming clinic (or remote clinic visit) scheduled, they will be contact[CONTACT_374420] a study coordinator/provider and will be provided with a brief description 
of the study to determine interest in order to allow patients to schedule sufficient  time for 
study activities following their clinic appointment. If patients do not have an upcoming 
clinic visit, they w ill be contact[CONTACT_48671] a  study coordinator/provider and given a 
brief description of the study. If interested, participants will be  screened using the  
inclusion/exclusion criteria (see  Screening Questionnaire ). If eligible, patients will be e-
consented to the study using REDCap e -consent procedures by a study coordinator . A 
study coordinator will email a link to the e -consent form to the participant and then 
thoroughly explain the study, allowing time for participants to ask questions. If 
participant is still interested, they will be instructed to sign the e -consent form using the 
link. After participants have been e -consented, they wi ll be randomized to one of the 
study conditions  (usual care vs. CBT) . Following e -consent, participants will be emailed 
a copy of their signed e -consent form. Following their clinic appointment, all participants 
will complete study questionnaires  (see Tabl e of Assessments below) .  
 
Randomization Procedures:  Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: 
(1) Itch CBT or (2) Usual care. Randomization will occur on a 1:1 ratio and within strata, 
which are gender (male vs. female) and Itch Numerical Rating Scale (4 -6 vs. 7 -10). 
Participants will be randomized to treatment based on a predetermined list within each 
strata created using the  blockrand  package of R. Randomization will occur by [CONTACT_374421], 
with varying block sizes, in accord with recommended me thods for RCTs. The 
randomization key will be linked to a unique study ID number, as well as to a treatment 
condition (Itch CBT vs. Usual Care).  Participants will be aware that there are different 
arms they can be assigned to and will know which randomizat ion group they are 
assigned.  
 
 
For participants randomized to the Usual Care Arm:  
Participants randomized to the Usual Care arm of the study will receive eczema 
educational materials that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_374404] a 
clinic (or telehealth) visit . Examples include an eczema action plan that is created by [CONTACT_374422], handouts on recommendations for dry skin, etc.  
Participan ts in the Usual Care arm will complete the same schedule of study surveys (see 
Table of Assessments below) as participants randomized to the CBT arm.  
 
For participant randomized to the CBT Arm:  
Participants  randomized to the CBT arm of the study will be contact[CONTACT_374423][INVESTIGATOR_374405]  (see Assessment Interview  
document ) about understanding of AD, adherence to medication, strategies they use to

5.4 Statistical Analysis Plan – Aim [ADDRESS_468700] with 
CONSORT guidelines. Although the response profile analysis will be our primary 
approach, we will also explore alternat ive approaches. Latent growth curve models use 
all available data (i.e., they do not discard observations with missing data) and provide 
valid inferences in the presence of missing outcome data under the missing at random 
(MAR) assumption.  
 
The primary out come measures will be the NRS Itch Severity and the CDLQI. All other 
questionnaires will be used as secondary outcome measures.  
Primary outcomes:  
1. NRS Itch Severity  
2. CDLQI  
Secondary outcomes:All other questionnaires listed above.  
 
 
6.0 Data Management  
 
All of the data will be collected at Lurie Children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374408] a secure 
research server that is maintained by [CONTACT_78143]. Survey data will be 
maintained within Northwestern University’s secure REDCap system. Only members of 
the au thorized study team will have access to these systems.  
 
Protected health information (PHI) necessary for study management (subject name [CONTACT_374424]) is separated from the study data and non -PHI clinical data. This 
Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Treat Itch Rumination “Itch CBT” in Eczema  
 Page [ADDRESS_468701] ID and that will be the link between PHI data and 
non-PHI clinical data. PHI will be marked appropriately in REDCap so data will not be 
exported with identifiers. Any review of data outside of the IRB -approved research team 
will be done only using de -identified data and/or summary tables or figures once the 
appropriate data use agreements are in place.  
 
 
Data Storage  for project  
 
The team  will create a central databa se for storage of data  on the FSM research server 
within the Department of Medical Social Sciences . Data will be deidentified with a 
separate coded identifier list with subject IDs.  
 
 
7.0 Risks and Benefits to Subjects  
7.1 Risks : 
Because the study procedures take the form of interviews, there are no safety risks to 
consider in this study. Participation in this study does not involve any physical or 
emotional risk to participants beyond that of everyday life.  
 
Interview s and Questionnaires : Interview participan ts and/or those completing 
questionnaires  can choose to not answer a question, skip a question, request a break, or to 
stop/leave the interview/focus group at any time. Breaks will also be offered to 
participants throughout the interview. There is a very s mall risk of  loss of confidentiality. 
Every measure to safeguard the information will be taken by [CONTACT_5051] , including 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_374409] a locked cabinet and/or password -protected and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_374410] -identified using a st udy ID number.  
 
Audio Recordings: There is a risk of loss of confidentiality with the audio recordings. 
Audio recordings will be destroyed after the study team has reviewed all interview notes 
and confirmed they are complete . In the interim, audio recordin gs will be kept in a 
secure , locked  area to ensure access is only granted to the authorized research personnel.  
 
7.2 Benefits:  
Participants may not have any direct benefit from being in this research study but taking 
part in this research study may enable investigators to create a comprehensive pool of 
items that fully describe the patient experience with AD and itch.  It is possible that 
participants randomized to the CBT arm may receive direct benefit in the form of 
decreased symptom/symptom bother from th e intervention being tested in this study.  
 
Compensation for Arm 2:  
Participants randomized to the CBT arm will be paid up to a maximum of $130 for their 
participation over the course of the study. Participants randomized to the Usual Care arm 
will be pai d up to a maximum of $90 for their participation. Participants will be paid 
according to the following schedule:

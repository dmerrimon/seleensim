Venous Insufficiency  
Investigational Product  Commercially distributed Varithena® (polidocanol injectable foam) 
1% (Approved 25 Nov 2013 NDA 205098)   
Type of Protocol  Phase 4 Registry  
Rationale  The purpose of this registry  is to observe the effects of Varithena® 
on venous leg ulcer (VLU) healing in patients who have symptoms 
of chronic venous insufficiency. The impac t of treatment on rate of 
healing, rate of recurrence, subject ’s pain and quality of life will be 
observed.  
Objective(s)  To evaluate VLU healing rate, recurrence  rate, and patient reported 
outcomes for Varithena® in C6 disease per Clinical Etiologic 
Anatomic Pathophysiologic (CEAP) c lassification  
Primary Endpoint (s)   Rate of epi[INVESTIGATOR_69021]  (mm/week) measured by [CONTACT_794671] 
(DCT) and submitted to Tissue Analytics® for analysi s 
 Wound  closure at 12 weeks  (±1wk)  post-treatment  
 Time from initial treatment with Varithena® to wound closure  
Secondary Endpoint (s)   Percent of wounds remaining closed at [ADDRESS_1096196] -wound 
closure  
 VLU recurrence (at same site) at [ADDRESS_1096197]-
treatment  
 Change  in pain at ulcer location on numeric pain rating scale 
(NPRS) compared to baseline at [ADDRESS_1096198] -treatment  
 Change  on EuroQol  five dimension five level questionnaire  (EQ-
5D-5L) quality of life assessment co mpared to baseline at [ADDRESS_1096199] -treatment  
 Change in Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) of treated leg 
from Screening/ Baseline to [ADDRESS_1096200]-
treatment  
 Number of ulcer free weeks  defined as weeks from closure

(GSV) system and/or anterior accessory saphenous vein (AASV) 
incompetence and resulting VLU using Varithena®. VLU recurrence 
information is collected for those with healed wounds during the 12 
month follow -up period.  
Note: In cases of cluster wounds, Investigator collects data for a 
single, primary wound. If more than one wound meets  eligibility 
criteria, Inves tigator determines which wound to evaluate as the 
primary. All endpoint measurements  are collected for the primary 
wound.  
Population  Patients classified C6 on CEAP  classification  with active VLU 
resulting from venous insufficiency of the GSV system and/or  AASV   
Subject Sample and 
Investigational Sites  Up to  200 subjects scheduled to receive Varithena® for active VLU 
(C6) resulting from venous insufficiency of the GSV  system  and/or 
AASV will be enrolled at up to 40 investigational sites in the United 
States  and Canada . 
Treatment  Subjects scheduled for treatment with Varithena® are treated  in 
accordance with the Investigator’s  standard of care  (SoC) , including 
treatment of varicose tributaries in the proximity of the ulcer bed. 
Administration procedures and volume are per SoC, full prescribing 
information (FPI) and instructions for use (IFU).  Additional  
treatment(s) with Varithena® can be administered  at Investigator’s 
discretion and according to FPI.    
Post-procedure care, including compression dressing, should be 
used and prescribed in accordance with Investigator’s SoC.

Summary statistics of the primary and secondary endpoints will be 
reported with 95% confidence intervals  (CI). CIs will be estimated 
using the Kaplan -Meier me thod for  time to event analyses and the 
exact ( e.g., Clopper -Pearson) method for binomial proportion 
analyses.  
Additionally, distribution of continuous endpoints will be evaluated 
for skewness. Missing data will not be imputed.  
Registry  Procedures  See Ta ble 1: Schedule of Registry  Assessments below  
Data Collection  All Investigator and subject data is collected via a DCT. There are 
two versions of the DCT: physician -facing, referred to as 
Investigator data capture tool  (iDCT), and subject -facing, referred  to 
as subject data capture tool (sDCT).  Investigator data can be 
entered into the iDCT through a n application downloaded on a  
Sponsor -provided tablet  or by [CONTACT_794673]. Subjects collect 
wound photographs  and answer an NPRS question  on a Sponsor -
provided tablet  via the sDCT  at designated time points. This allows 
for photograph  and data collection between clinic visits.  
Data is maintained in a Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) compliant database. Subject data is 
linked to Investigator data by [CONTACT_794674] (SIC).  
Central Imaging  All wound photographs  collected for this registry  are submitted via 
the iDCT and sDCT . Tissue Analytics® analyzes  each photograph , 
or set of photographs for circumferential wounds,  and provides 
wound color and size  data for  statistical analyses.

Page [ADDRESS_1096204] common chronic wounds in ambulatory elderly population accounting for 60-
70% of all lower extremity wounds. There is higher prevalence of VLUs in individuals with fewer 
economic resources and years of education. VLUs also result in reduced quality of life and 
social isolation.[ADDRESS_1096205] high recurrence rates ranging from 54-78%.2 
Symptomatic venous disease prevalence is estimated to be 5% of the population.3 Prevalence 
of VLUs in the population older than 60 years of age is 1- 3%4,5 with annual treatment costs 
reaching $14.[ADDRESS_1096206] compression therapy alone . 
The landmark ESCHAR trial by [CONTACT_794676] (multilayered 
compression bandage wraps) to superficial venous surgery plus compression therapy. There 
was no significant improvement in the ulcer healing between both the groups (89% versus 93%) 
at 48 months.7,8 The ESCHAR trial also reported a reduction in 12-month ulcer recurrence rates 
in the surgery plus compression group versus those with compression therapy alone (12% 
versus 28%; CI 1.78-4.27; p < 0.0001). This difference in ulcer recurrence rates persisted at 4 
years. The recurrence rates with surgery were similar to the results reported earlier by [CONTACT_794677].9 A weakness of the trial was that there was no surgical arm without compression. It is also 
important to note that this study did not include treatment of pathologic perforators. Conversely, 
Scriven et. al. studied patients with normal deep venous system and demonstrated 
improvement in venous ulcer healing with saphenous vein strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], even without compression 
bandaging.10 
The association of incompetent perforators and venous ulcers is well-known. In the 1990s and 
mid-2000s, sub-fascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery (SEPS) was widely used for the 
treatment of perforator reflux.[ADDRESS_1096207] made SEPS obsolete in the western hemisphere. The North

4.2 Varithena® Product Description 
Varithena® (polidocanol injectable foam) 1% is a low-nitrogen, microfoam with uniform density, 
size, and stability, dispensed from a proprietary canister device. It is formulated with a gas 
mixture (carbon dioxide/oxygen) designed to maintain physical foam characteristics while 
allowing rapid bubble absorption following injection. The foam remains coherent, displacing the 
blood in the vein and efficiently delivering the sclerosant to the venous endothelium. It is 
echogenic and therefore can be directed to the intended segments of incompetent vein using 
duplex ultrasound. The net effect is that with a small total dose of active sclerosant, a large vein 
can be emptied of blood . The sclerosant, neither diluted nor de-activated, acts on the 
endothelium and in combination with adequate post-treatment compression can successfully 
sclerose large veins. 
Varithena® is indicated for the treatment of incompetent great saphenous veins, accessory 
saphenous veins and visible varicosities of the GSV system above and below the knee. 
Varithena® improves the symptoms of superficial venous incompetence and the appearance of 
visible varicosities.  
A complete description of Varithena® may be found in the FPI (Appendix C ) and I FU (Appendix 
D). 
4.3 Varithena® Clinical Summary 
Varithena® (polidocanol injectable foam) has been evaluated in 12 clinical studies. The two 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_794640]® were randomized, blinded, multicenter clinical 
trials designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Varithena® 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0% (VANISH-
1) and Varithena® 0.5% and 1.0% (VANISH-2) compared with placebo in the treatment of both 
symptoms and appearance of varicose veins in patients with saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) 
incompetence as evidenced by [CONTACT_794678]. In both studies, a 
Varithena® 0.125% treatment group was included as a control for blinding of the duplex 
ultrasound assessment. Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, 
inability to comply with post-treatment compression due to severe peripheral arterial disease or 
leg obesity, incompetence of the small saphenous vein or deep venous reflux as a major source 
of reflux, reduced mobility, major surgery, pregnancy, or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_794641]. In these clinical trials, the maximum volume of injectable foam or 
placebo to be administered per treatment session was 15mL. 
In VANISH-1, patients received one blinded treatment and in VANISH-2, patients received one 
blinded treatment with an option for a second blinded treatment 1 week later. In VANISH-2, 
patients in the Varithena® 1.0% treatment group received an average of 1.[ADDRESS_1096217]-procedure compression therapy for 14 days following treatment. 
Of the 519 patients randomized into VANISH-1 and VANISH-2, a total of 511 were treated with 
either Varithena® 0.5% (n=111), 1.0% (n=110), or 2.0% (n=63), Varithena® 0.125% as control 
(n=114), or placebo (n=113).

For both VANISH-1 and VANISH-2, treatment with 1.0% was superior to placebo in improving 
symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_794679]® (Varicose Vein Symptom Questionnaire), when either a 
duration or an intensity scale was used to measure patients’ symptoms. 
VCSS is a clinician rating of severity of chronic venous insufficiency ranging from 0 to 30, where 
higher scores indicate more severe venous disease. In VANISH-1 and VANISH-2, the adjusted 
mean changes from baseline in VCSS in the 1% Varithena® treatment groups were 3.70 and 
5.05, respectively, at Week 8 compared with 0.75 and 1.52 points in the placebo groups, 
respectively. For both studies, the differences between these improvements were statistically 
significant (P<0.0001). 
The physiological response to treatment as measured by [CONTACT_136665] (duplex response) 
was defined as elimination of reflux through the SFJ and/or complete occlusion of all 
incompetent GSV and major accessory veins at baseline. The primary comparison for duplex 
response in both studies was the pooled Varithena® groups vs. the Varithena® 0.125% (control) 
group. For both studies, the pooled Varithena® groups were statistically superior to the 0.125% 
(control) group. In VANISH-1 and VANISH-2, in the pooled groups, 75% and 85% of patients 
respectively, compared with 42% of patients and 60% of patients, respectively, in the 0.125% 
(control) groups, met the criteria for response to treatment. These differences were statistically 
significant (P≤0.0002).  
VEINES-QOL (Venous Insufficiency Epi[INVESTIGATOR_516165]) is a 
disease-specific quality of life instrument, ranging from 0 (worst possible quality of life) to 100 
(best possible quality of life). In VANISH-1 and VANISH-2, the adjusted mean changes from 
baseline in VEINES-QOL in the pooled Varithena® treatment groups were 21.2 and 21.6, 
respectively, at Week 8 compared with 7.7 and 7.4 points in the placebo groups, respectively. 
For both studies, the differences between these improvements are statistically significant 
(P<0.0001). 
For efficacy endpoints, Varithena® treatment effects were consistent across subgroups of age, 
sex, BMI (up to 48 kg/m2), CEAP clinical class, GSV diameter (up to 25.9 mm) and VCSS. 
A total of 1333 patients in 12 clinical trials were evaluated for safety when treated with 
Varithena® at dose concentrations of 0.125%, 0.5%, 1.0% or 2.0%, including 437 patients 
treated with Varithena® in placebo-controlled clinical trials. 
The AEs most commonly observed in the clinical studies of Varit hena® are manageable events 
that would be expected in patients undergoing a minimally-invasive medical procedure for the 
treatment of GSV incompetence. These include infusion site thrombosis (retained coagulum), 
injection site hematoma, contusion, pain in extremity, limb discomfort, and superficial 
thrombophlebitis. Post-procedural pain resolved within 1 week in 80% of the cases reported, 
and very few Varithena®-treated patients were treated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_82693] 10 days of 
the study treatment procedure. 
In the 1333 patients treated with Varithena® in the clinical studies, there were no anaphylaxis or 
major hypersensitivity reactions, no deaths or non-fatal SAEs attributed to the study treatment, 
and only a small number of patients with severe AEs or withdrawals due to AE. The following 
venous thrombus AEs occurred: common femoral vein thrombus extension (2.9%), proximal 
DVT (1.7%), distal DVT (1.1%), isolated gastrocnemius and soleal vein thrombosis (1.4%). 
Proximal symptomatic venous thrombi occurred in <1% of patients treated with Varithena®. 
Approximately half (49%) of patients with thrombi received treatment with anticoagulants. 
Neurologic adverse events (e.g., cerebrovascular accident, migraines) have been reported in 
patients following administration of physician-compounded foam sclerosants. None of the 1333 
patients in the Varithena® trials experienced clinically important neurological or visual adverse

events suggestive of cerebral gas embolism. The incidence of neurologic and visual adverse 
events within one day of treatment in the placebo-controlled studies was 2.7% in the pooled 
Varithena® group and 4.0% in the placebo groups.  
Skin discoloration adverse events were reported in 1.1% of the pooled Varithena® group and 
0.7% of the placebo group in the placebo-controlled studies. 
The VANISH- 2 trial (22) compared 0.5% and 1% Varithena® concentration to placebo in 232 
patients (placebo n=57; 0.125% control n=57; 0.5% Varithena® n=60; 1% Varithena® n=58). 
94.8% of the patients enrolled were in the Clinical, Etiological, Anatomical, and 
Pathophysiological (CEAP) clinical class C2 through C4 [C2 (varicose veins) 31.9%; C3 
(edema) 40.1%; C4 (skin changes) 22.8%], while C5 (healed venous ulcer) and C6 (active 
venous ulcer) class accounted only to 5.2%. The primary and secondary endpoints included 
improvement in the varicose vein related symptoms and appearance. These parameters were 
tested with 3 newly validated clinical outcome assessments and patient reported outcome 
measures; the Varicose Vein Symptoms Questionnaire (VVSymQ), a patient self-assessment 
score of [ADDRESS_1096218] important symptoms of varicose veins; the Patient Self-Assessment of Visible 
Varicose Veins (PA-V3); and, the Independent Photography Review of Visible Varicose Veins 
(IPR-V3) by [CONTACT_794680]. At 8 weeks, Varithena® in concentrations of 0.5% and 
1% demonstrated statistically significant superior results when compared to placebo with larger 
improvements of symptoms and greater improvements in physician and patient assessments of 
the appearance as compared to placebo. 60% of the Varithena® patients demonstrated at least 
one adverse event compared with 39% of placebo. However, 95% of these were mild or 
moderate. No pulmonary emboli were detected and no clinically significant neurologic or visual 
adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events with Varithena® were 
retained coagulum, limb pain, and superficial thrombophlebitis most of which resolved at end of 
study. Of the 232 patients that were treated at baseline visit, 230 patients completed the eighth 
week follow-up visit. These 230 patients then entered the one-year extension study. Of these, 
87.9% received additional open label Varithena®, within 2 to 3 weeks after the 8-week follow- up 
visit. These results were reported in a subsequent study (23). At 1 year, there was improvement 
in symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_794681], IPR-V3 and PA-V3. There 
were also reductions in disease severity, as measured by [CONTACT_794682] 
(VCSS) and quality of life measures. There were no new venous thrombotic events. There were 
no clinically important long term adverse sequelae in patients who had thrombophlebitis at the 
8-week visit, including recurrence of thrombosis or evidence of post-thrombotic syndrome at 1 
year. The proportion of patients with a duplex ultrasound response was 89% at 8 weeks and 
73% at 1 year. 
In a separate study (VANISH-1),   Varithena® was tested in patients with patients with moderate 
to severe symptoms of superficial venous incompetence and visible varicosities of the GSV 
system (24). 279 were randomized to either placebo (n=56), 0.125% Varithena® (n=57), 0.5% 
Varithena® (n=51), 1% Varithena® (n=52), or 2% Varithena® (n=63). The primary endpoint was 
similar to the VANISH-2 trial. Patient-reported venous symptom improvement was measured as 
a change from baseline to week 8 in the VVSymQ score. Secondary endpoints included 
appearance measures tested with IPR-V3 and PA-V3 scores. Tertiary endpoints measured 
included duplex ultrasound response, changes in VCSS, and the modified Venous Insufficiency 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_509072]. At week 8, VVSymQ scores for the pooled Varithena® 
group (0.5% + 1% + 2%; p < 0.0001) and individual dose concentrations (p < 0.001) were 
significantly superior to placebo. Mean changes from baseline to week 8 in IPR- V3 and PA-V3 
scores were also significantly greater for pooled Varithena® than for placebo (p < 0.0001). The 
tertiary end point of duplex ultrasound response was defined as the elimination of sapheno-
femoral junction (SFJ) reflux and/or complete occlusion of the incompetent GSV and/or major

saphenous accessory vein. This Duplex ultrasound response rates for patients treated with 
Varithena® 0.5%, 1%, and 2% foam (pooled and individually) ranged from 59% to 83%. There 
were no pulmonary emboli noted. No patient discontinued the study due to an adverse event. 15 
patients (5.5%) had a common femoral vein thrombus extension. 5 patients had proximal DVTs 
(popliteal vein or above), 4 had distal DVTs, and 3 had isolated gastrocnemius and soleal DVTs. 
The total of 27 patients with DVTs accounted for a DVT rate of 9.8% with this technique. In 
summary,   Varithena® has been studied in more than 1300 patients and has demonstrated 
consistent improvement in patient-reported clinical outcomes and in clinical appearance. 
Varithena® has a distinct advantage over other non-thermal techniques in the treatment of 
patients with severe venous disease, as the foam can reach the veins under the diseased and 
lipodermatosclerotic skin as well as the feeder veins in close proximity to the venous ulcers, 
without any concern for nerve injury. Neovascularized veins, tortuous veins, and post-thrombotic 
(scarred) veins are extremely difficult to navigate with thermal technologies and other non-
thermal technologies. Varith ena® is again advantageous in these settings as foam can traverse 
through these areas.  
Varithena® treatment has been shown to result in both hemodynamic and symptomatic benefit 
for patients. The Varithena® studies have had equivalent pooled benefit to alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(surgery and sclerotherapy) so it can be anticipated that, as with other studies, there will be 
improved ulcer healing following Varithena® treatment. Varithena® can uniquely extend therapy 
to the most distal varicose tributaries, close or even under the ulcer bed. It is possible the 
treatment may confer greater advantage, as it did with a few C5 and C6 patients. It is therefore 
appropriate to investigate the benefit Varithena® may provide in accelerating ulcer healing and 
reduction of ulcer recurrence. Given the paucity of treatment availability for this patient 
population, there is great value in better understanding the effects of Varithena® on healing, 
recurrence rates and quality of life for patients with venous insufficiency resulting in VLUs. This 
registry is designed to provide insights into treating this difficult indication.  
5. REGISTRY OBJECTIVE AND PURPOSE 
5.1 Objective(s ) 
The purpose of this registry is to observe the effects of Varithena® on VLU healing in patients 
who have the symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency. The objective of the registry is to 
evaluate VLU healing rate, recurrence rate, and patient reported outcomes for Varithena® in C6 
disease per Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathophysiologic (CEAP) classification 
5.[ADDRESS_1096219] treatment and outcome 
data related to subjects treated with Varithena® for GSV system and/or AASV incompetence 
resulting in VLU. Subjects are treated per Investigator’s SoC and in accordance with the FPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_794642]. For subjects with healed ulcers during the 12 month follow- up period, VLU recurrence 
information is collected. Wound recurrence is defined as the reopening of a wound that was 
previously closed; recurrence must occur at same location.  
Note: In cases of cluster wounds, Investigator collects data for a single, primary wound. If more 
than one wound meets eligibility criteria, Investigator determines which wound to evaluate as 
the primary. All endpoint measurements are collected for the primary wound.

7.1 Varithena® (polidocanol injectable foam) 1% 
Treatment with Varithena® is selected and administered per SoC and the FPI . Varithena® is 
commercially available. As such, investigational product ( IP) accountability and tracking is not 
necessary.  
7.1.1 Dosage & Administration 
Subject is treated on Day 0 with up to 15mL of Varithena®, above and below the knee as 
needed, per Investigator’s clinical judgement and the FPI . Each injection should not exceed 
5mL. Date of treatment, number of injection sites, and volume above and below the knee is 
recorded in the i DCT. Appendix E : Use of Varithena® to manage patients with GSV-derived 
venous hypertension and chronic venous leg ulcer is provided as a guide to best practices in

7.1.2 Additional Treatment 
Additional treatment(s) of Varithena® can be administered at Investigator’s discretion and 
according to FPI . Note that additional treatment should not be administered sooner than [ADDRESS_1096227]-treatment Management 
Following treatment with Varithena®, subjects should be treated with compression dressing per 
Investigator’s SoC. Subjects are referred to a local WCC. The WCC does not need to be 
affiliated with the investigational site . Subjects’ compression dressing is checked and change d 
at the WCC. Subjects are asked to continue to visit the WCC weekly for continuing care until the 
wound is healed. At each WCC when the wound area is exposed, the patient should make 
every effort to take a photograph of the wound, or the wound area if the wound has healed , 
using the sDCT. The pain rating should also be recorded in the sDCT by [CONTACT_794688] . 
The staff at the WCC are not delegated under the investigational site, so the subject should 
understand that they are responsible for collecting the photograph and answering the NPRS 
question independently.

7.1.4 Duration of Treatment and Follow- up 
Following the initial treatment with Varithena®, each subject is followed for 12 months. Additional 
treatment can be administered following the initial treatment; however, it is recommended that 
re-treatment occur as close to the time of the initial treatment as is possible, but not sooner than 
[ADDRESS_1096229]. 
During the follow- up period, subjects are followed for VLU-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], wound

12 months ( ±1wk) post-treatment. Subjects are contact[CONTACT_794689]- up 3 months 
(±1wk) post wound-closure, and 6 months (±1wk) post-treatment. Subjects collect wound 
photographs between follow-up visits when the wound dressing is being changed at the WCC.    
7.1.5 Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_794644] 6 week period prior to enrollment. 
Treatment with heat ablation could confound the outcome of treatment with Varithena®. For 
subjects who have had recent heat ablation treatment (greater than 6 weeks but less than 6 
months), it should be clear to Investigator that ulcer is not healing or would not heal were 
subject not to receive additional treatment. 
It is suggested that heat ablation not be used after treatment until the primary endpoint data 
have  been collected at Week 12 Follow- up visit. This allows for assessment of the effects of 
Varithena® without heat ablation as a confounding factor.

8. MEASUREMENTS AND EVALUATIONS 
8.1 Time and Event Schedule 
8.1.1 Screening /Baseline Visit (can occur up to 14 days prior to treatment) (Clinic)  
The screening phase begins when the ICF is fully signed and dated and ends at the initiation of 
initial treatment with Varithena® (Day 0) .  
The following evaluations are performed at Screening/Baseline: 
 Review and signing of the ICF 
 Review and confirmation of eligibility to participate in the registry 
 Collection of demographic information, wound history (including prior treatments), and 
physical examination to assess venous and wound characteristics 
 Collection of photograph (photographs if wound is circumferential) in iDCT 
8.1.2 Enrollment/Treatment Visit (Day 0) (Clinic)  
Screening/Baseline and Enrollment/Treatment visit measurements and evaluations may occur 
at the same visit if subject is provided adequat e time to consider and have all questions 
answered.  
The following are performed at this visit: 
 Collection of data prior to treatment: 
- Photograph(s) of wound in i DCT 
- VCSS  
- NPRS  
- EQ-5D-5L quality of life assessment 
 Varithena® Treatment – treatment procedure and collection of treatment details 
8.1.3 Week 1 Visit (1st Follow- up Visit Per SoC) (Clinic)  
This visit is not required to occur within first week after initial treatment but should be the first 
follow- up visit per SoC. If retreatment is expected, this visit should occur no sooner than [ADDRESS_1096230].  
The following are performed at the Week 1 visit: 
 Subject is trained to use sDCT  
- Subject collects photograph(s) of wound using s DCT (additional training required 
for circumferential wounds) 
- Subject enters NPRS  response into sDCT

8.1.4 Week 2 through Wound Closure (at WCC)  
The subject does not return to the investigational site at this time. The subject presents to a 
WCC for wound care and dressing changes on about a weekly basis. During each visit to the 
WCC, subject is asked to take a photograph (multiple photographs for circumferential wounds) 
of the wound and answer the NPRS question using the sDCT. It is important that the subject 
understands that the WCC staff may not be aware of the registry, so collection of the 
photograph(s) and answering the NPRS question should be completed independently. The 
subject should refer questions about the sDCT and data collection to the investigational site, or 
contact [CONTACT_205849]® for technical support.  
If the wound is not healed at the Week [ADDRESS_1096231] 
photograph(s) and answer NPRS questions at weekly WCC visits until wound closure.  
8.1.5 Week 12 Visit (±1 wk) (Clinic)  
The following are performed and entered into the iDCT at this visit: 
 Collection of wound photograph(s) or photograph of wound area if wound is healed 
 VCSS  
 NPRS  
 EQ-5D-5L quality of life assessment 
 Assessment of medical compression therapy compliance 
8.1.6 3 Months (±1 wk) Post-Wound-Closure (Telephone)  
Once the subject’s wound is determined to be healed, Tissue Analytics® schedules a reminder 
for Investigator or delegate to contact [CONTACT_794690] 3 months (±1 week) to perform 
the following: 
 Assessment for VLU recurrence 
 Assessment of medical compression therapy compliance 
 Request that subject collects the following using the sDCT : 
- Photograph of wound area, or wound if reccurred 
- NPRS  
8.1.7 6 Months (±1 wk) Post-Treatment (Telephone)  
Investigator or delegate contacts the subject by [CONTACT_794691]:

related evaluations can be performed. 
Investigator or qualified delegate reviews the treatment plans with the patient and the patient 
has an opportunity to ask questions about trial procedures, the follow- up schedule, risks and 
benefits of the treatment and alternative treatment options prior to signature. The patient 
receives a copy of the signed ICF to keep for their records.  
S
ubjects will be informed of any revisions of the ICF and relevant revisions are signed and kept 
in the subject’s file.  
The consenting process, acquisition of the ICF and any revisions should be documented in the 
subject’s medical record and the ICF should be signed and dated by [CONTACT_274978]. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_1096233] Idendification Code (SIC) 
Subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria for the registry are assigned a n SIC by 
[CONTACT_181253]. The SIC is used to deidentify subject data and should be used on 
source worksheets and for data entry purposes. The Investigator or delegate maintains an SIC 
list, a confidential list of subjects’ names and associated SICs which allows Investigator to 
determine identity of all subjects.

screening that the subject is able.    
8.2.8 Varithena® Treatment Record 
The following data is recorded in the iDCT for the initial treatment with Varithena® and any touch 
up treatment: 
 Treatment date 
 Volume injected above the knee 
 Volume injected below the knee 
 Total number of injection sites (for specified treatment date)

8.2.10 Venous Clinical Severity Score (Revised) 
The VCSS  assesses nine common signs/symptoms of venous disease : skin changes and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], inflammation and induration, and ulcers (including number, size, and duration). A 
tenth item assesses compression compliance. Each item is scored individually on a 0-3 point 
scale. The revised VCSS clarifies ambiguities in category descriptions and contains a n 
additional category for compression. Investigator or delegate should complete assessment on 
source worksheet (SW) and enter data into i DCT.  
8.2.11 EQ-5D-5L Quality of Life Assessment 
The EQ- 5D-5L is a validated, widely used quality of life assessment. It is a patient reported 
outcome that provides a simple descriptive profile and single index value for health status . The 
questionnaire consists of 5 questions pertaining to specific health dimensions, including 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and overall health status 
rating scale. Subjects should complete questionnaire on SW and data is entered into iDCT.

9. ADVERSE EVENTS 
9.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event (AE)   any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with the treatment22  
An undesirable event can be, but is not limited to, symptoms experienced by a subject or 
objective findings, such as significant clinical laboratory abnormalities. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)   any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 results in death, 
 is life-threatening (Note: The term “life-threatening” refers to an event in which the 
patie nt was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe), 
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
 is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_794646]22 
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)   a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and 
which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or 
for modification of physiological function.22 
Unexpected Adverse Event  an AE for which the nature or severity is not consistent with 
information in the relevant source document(s).[ADDRESS_1096242] completes the registry or 
withdraws. If Investigator or delegate becomes aware of an AE and wishes to report it to the 
Sponsor/Manufacturer , Investigator or delegate should report the event by [CONTACT_794695] (Apendix H) via email to [EMAIL_15102] . Questions about AEs or other 
safety-related concerns can also be sent via the same email address.  
In some cases, Sponsor/Manufacturer may need additional information from investigational site 
in order to provide a report to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to comply with 
mandatory regulatory reporting. Sponsor will request additional medical information about 
subject as needed.  
If additional safety information becomes available during the course of the registry, Sponsor will 
amend protocol and ICF as necessary.

10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1 Statistical Analysis  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be a separate document and will be updated as required, 
in association with any protocol amendments prior to database lock. The SAP will include 
detailed descriptions of statistical methodology. 
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include number of patients, means, medians, 
standard deviations, standard errors, minima and maxima. For categorical variables, 
frequencies and percentages will be given; 95% CI will be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson 
(exact) method for binary proportions. For time to event variables, the number of patients, 
number of events, the median and 95% CI of the median, and quartiles will be provided by [CONTACT_794696] (KM) method. 
Missing data will not be imputed.  
Baseline is defined as the last available measurement taken before the first treatment. 
10.[ADDRESS_1096243] additional data on treatment of a specific 
indication for which Varithena® is approved but has not been examined in detail. Previous 
feasibility metrics indicate approximately 200 subjects can be enrolled within one year. 
10.2.1 Analysis Populations  
The Efficacy Population will include all patients who are treated with Varithena® and who have 
at least one post treatment primary endpoint assessment. 
10.3 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The three primary endpoints are: 
 Rate of epi[INVESTIGATOR_69021] (mm/week) by [CONTACT_794697] 
 Wound closure at [ADDRESS_1096244]-treatment 
 Time to wound closure 
Summary statistics with 95% CI will be provided for all primary endpoints. The Clopper-Pearson 
method will be used for binary proportions (wound closure at [ADDRESS_1096245]-treatment). 
Additionally, distribution of time to wound closure will be estimated using the Kaplan Meier (KM) 
method and the 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile will be presented along with 95% 
CIs.  
The primary endpoint, rate of epi[INVESTIGATOR_69021], will be evaluated for skewness using the 
Kolmogorov Smirnov test. In the event of significant skewness, the interquartile range will be 
reported in addition to the 95% CI.

10.4 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary endpoints are: 
 Wounds remaining closed at [ADDRESS_1096246]-wound closure 
 VLU recurrence (at same site) at [ADDRESS_1096247]-treatment 
 Change in pain on NPRS compared to baseline at [ADDRESS_1096248]-
treatment 
 Change on EQ- 5D-5L quality of life assessment compared to baseline at [ADDRESS_1096249]-treatment 
 Change in VCSS from Baseline to 12 week and 12 month follow- up 
 Number of ulcer free weeks 
The proportion of wounds remaining closed at [ADDRESS_1096250]-wound closure will be presented 
with frequencies and percentages with 95% CIs based on Clopper-Pearson. Similarly, 
recurrence at [ADDRESS_1096251]-treatment will be presented with frequencies and 
percentages with 95% CIs. 
Change from baseline for pain on the NPRS, the index health state based on EQ- 5D-5L and 
VCSS will be presented by [CONTACT_794698] 95% CIs.  
Summary statistics for the number of ulcer free weeks will be presented along with the 
distribution of the number of ulcer free weeks (time to recurrence) estimated using the KM 
method and the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile will be presented along with 95% 
CIs. 
10.[ADDRESS_1096252] age, wound age, presence of infection, ambulatory method and total wounds/ulcers of 
any type. The NPRS scale will be grouped into categories by [CONTACT_926] (no pain, mild pain, 
moderate pain and severe pain) and presented in a shift table. Similarly, each EQ- 5D-5L 
dimension will be summarized by a shift table. The overall visual analogue scale (VAS) and 
change from baseline will be descriptively summarized. 
The Wound Healing Index (WHI)23 is the predicated probability of a specified wound becoming 
healed and is created from multiplying the logistic regression parameter estimates by [CONTACT_794699] a wound category type. The WHI will be calculated by [CONTACT_794700]-specified parameters into a portal via the US Would Registry to get a score per 
patient. The eight pre-specified parameters are: 
1) Patient age in years at first treatment 
2) VLU age (duration) in days at first encounter 
3) VLU area in cm2 at first encounter 
4) Signs of infection or bioburden 
5) Wound on lateral leg? 
6) Patient’s primary ambulatory method 
7) Total wounds or ulcers of any type 
8) Encounter ends with patient being sent to emergency department or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]

11. DATA MANAGEMENT 
Data from the registry is collected via the Tissue Analytics® tablet application and website , 
collectively referred to as the data capture tool (DCT) . There are two versions of the DCT: 
physician-facing, referred to as Investigator data capture tool (iDCT), and subject-facing, 
referred to as subject data capture tool (sDCT). All data is transferred to Sponsor Clinical 
Development and Data Management (DM) groups in a secured format on a weekly basis, or as 
requested if needed more frequently. All processes are documented in the Data Management 
Plan (DMP). Delegated personnel are trained to use the i DCT and enter data on the 
observations, tests and assessments specified in this protocol and according to the data entry 
instructions. Each user has an individual login and password and is assigned a specific 
permission level, based on their study function. A Clinical Research Associate (CRA) reviews 
the data to check for missing, inconsistent or illogical data.  
Data entered in the DCTs are immediately saved to a central database and changes tracked to 
prov
ide an audit trail. Data validation checks are performed by [CONTACT_794701]
t checks comprised of validated computer programs and manual data review. Any data 
discrepancies are referred back to Investigator .  
When data have been entered, reviewed and edited, as necessary, Investigator is notified and 
asked to sign the data electronically via the Investigator Signature [CONTACT_794737] i DCT. After the 
database has been declared clean, it will be locked to prevent further editing. Editing in the 
database will only be allowed with the proper documentation. Each investigational site will 
receive a copy of the data for each subject they enrolled for archiving.

Some institutions, due to reasons of confidentiality, may not release their roster. In such 
instances, the institution’s General Assurance Number, assigned by [CONTACT_1762], is an acceptable substitute. 
12.4 Informed Consent – Ethical Compliance 
Investigator or delegate provides Sponsor with a copy of the IRB or REB-approved consent 
forms and a copy of the IRB/REB written approval, prior to investigational site initiation. 
Additionally, if the IRB/REB requires modifications to the sample ICF provided by [CONTACT_2728], the 
documentation supporting this requirement must be provided to Sponsor. 
It is the responsibility of Investigator or delegate to obtain written informed consent from 
subjects prior to the conduct of any trial procedures. All consent documentation must in 
accordance with applicable regulations and ICH GCP Guidelines. Each subject or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative is requested to sign the ICF after the subject has received and 
read written information and received an explanation of the registry, including but not limited to: 
the objectives, treatment plan, potential benefits and risk, inconveniences, alternative treatment 
options and the subject’s rights and responsibilities. A copy of the ICF must be given to the 
subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative. If applicable, it is provided in a 
certified translation of the subject’s local language.  
Acquisition of the informed consent should be documented in the subject medical record and 
the ICF should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_794705]. Signed consent forms must remain in each subject’s registry

13.1 Appendix A: CEAP Classification 
 
 
 Revised CEAP Classification of Venous Disorders 
Bo Eklöf, MD et al for the American Venous Forum International Ad Hoc Committee for 
Revision of the CEAP Classification7 
 
The CEAP classification for chronic venous disorders (CVD) was originally 
developed in 1994 by [CONTACT_794713], endorsed by [CONTACT_308859], and incorporated into 
“Reporting Standards in Venous Disease” in 1995. This classification system was 
designed to more clearly and accurately describe the form and severity of the 
venous disease being discussed.  
Rather than allowing it to stand as a static classification system, an ad hoc 
committee of the American Venous Forum recommended a number of changes in 
2004. These included refinement of several definitions; refinement of the C classes 
of CEAP; addition of the descriptor “n” (no venous abnormality identified); 
elaboration of the date of classification and level of investigation; and introduction 
of a basic CEAP version. The authors noted that CEAP is a descriptive 
classification, whereas venous severity scoring and quality of life scores are 
instruments for longitudinal research to assess outcomes.  
The letter "C" is based on the clinical findings, usually easily seen on 
physical examination.   
C0 = no visible or palpable signs of venous disease  
C1 = telangiectasies or reticular veins  
C2 = varicose veins  
C3 = edema  
C4a = pi[INVESTIGATOR_516173] 
C4b = lipodermatosclerosis or strophie blanche 
C5 = healed venous ulcer  
C6 = active venous ulcer 
After this number, the letter "a" is assigned if the patient is asymptomatic, and the 
letter "s" is assigned if the patient experiences symptoms. An additional number 
may follow the "s" to denote the severity of the symptom. More than one number 
may be assigned if the patient has several findings on clinical examination.

Version 1.1,  14Aug2017

The "E" stands for etiology, and the options are "c" for congenital disease, 
"p" for primary disease (not due to another cause), and "s" for secondary 
venous disease (postthrombotic), and “n” is for no venous cause identified.  
The "A" refers to anatomic findings, and is usually based on Duplex 
ultrasound examination. The options are as follows:   
 
Superficial veins (As)   
1. Telangiectasias or reticular veins  
2. Greater saphenous vein - above the knee  
3. Greater saphenous vein - below the knee  
4. Lesser (short) saphenous vein  
5. Nonsaphenous  
Deep veins (Ad)  
6. Inferior vena cava  
7. Common iliac  
8. Internal iliac  
9. External iliac  
10. Pelvic: gonadal, broad ligament, etc.  
11. Common femoral  
12. Deep femoral  
13. Superficial femoral  
14. Popliteal  
15. Crural: anterior tibial, posterior tibial, peroneal  
16. Muscular: gastrocnemius, soleus, etc.  
Perforator Veins (Ap) 
17. Thigh  
18. Calf  
No venous location identified (An) 
"P" refers to the pathophysiologic component, and the notations "r" for 
reflux, "o" for obstruction, or "r,o" for both reflux and obstruction may be 
used.   
To improve the assignment of designations under E, A, and P, a new descriptor, n, 
has been added and is now recommended for use where no venous abnormality is 
identified. The n can be added to E (E n, no venous cause identified), A (A n, no 
venous location identified), and P (P n, no venous pathology identified).  
Using the CEAP classification routinely in your patient records and in the medical literature 
will allow us to compare the efficacy of our treatments and to follow the progress of 
patients in an intelligent and meaningful way. Implementation of this classification is an 
easily achieved goal, and all phlebologists are encouraged to use this tool in their daily 
practice.

13.2 Appendix B: Venous Duplex Assessment 
1.  Guidelines for Duplex Venous Assessment  
1.1 Position of patient : Where possible, patients are assessed while standing, with the 
majority of weight on the opposite limb. The limb being scanned is slightly flexed at 
the knee and the foot is turned outwards. The patient should be observed throughout 
the procedure for possible syncope. When assessing the proximal deep veins for 
compressibility, the patient should be semi-supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (upper body raised to 30o to 
promote vein filling in the leg) ; however, when assessing the distal deep veins the 
patient should be in the sitting position.  
1.2 Ultrasound settings, choice of probes, assessment criteria : The selected 
ultrasound device should have color flow and pulsed Doppler available. The operator 
has the right to select their choice of probe frequency, but a linear array is essential 
for accurate measurements. A venous default setting is selected on the machine, or 
color flow velocity maps are selected to identify low velocity blood flow. 
 Calf compression and release and Valsalva are used to assess venous flow in both 
the deep and superficial veins. The normal color setting is blue for proximal flow and 
red for reflux. All veins should fill from wall to wall ; if the vein does not fill wall- to-wall 
thrombus may be present, but different steering angles and lower color flow velocity 
profiles should be used to optimize color filling. On release of the calf pressure, reflux 
is indicated by [CONTACT_794714] 0.5 seconds. 
1.3  Assessment of deep veins : A transducer is placed in the groin and the common 
femoral vein is identified medial to the common femoral artery. Turning the transducer 
by 90 degrees to view the common femoral vein in a cross-section (grayscale image) 
the patient is asked to perform a Valsalva maneuver. This should result in an increase 
in common femoral diameter. If no increase is seen, a proximal obstruction should be 
considered. Proximal obstruction can be confirmed by [CONTACT_794715] (longitudinal section); common femoral venous flow will be 
continuous and aphasic, a Valsalva maneuver will not result in a movement of blood 
towards the probe (i.e., in the same direction as arterial flow). If there is absence of 
phasicity of flow with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], detailed proximal vein scanning is to be undertaken 
(i.e., iliac veins). 
 The Doppler sample volume is steered to a 60-degree Doppler angle, with the 
common femoral vein flow and the sample volume size increased across the full 
diameter of the lumen. Augmentation of flow by [CONTACT_794716] a negative deflection on the spectral display. On release of the calf 
pressure, reflux will be seen as a positive deflection of greater than 0.[ADDRESS_1096266] of the leg. This procedure is repeated at regular intervals (2-3 
cm) along the length of the common femoral and femoral veins. Failure to fully 
compress the veins indicates the presence of thrombus. The echogenicity of the 
thrombus indicates its age, with fresh thrombus appearing as a similar echogenicity to 
Protocol BTG- 001652 -01 (VIEW-VLU)   
Version 1.1,  14Aug2017

 A BTG International group company   
the blood and old thrombus appearing as a similar echogenicity to the surrounding 
muscle tissue. 
 The transducer is placed over the popliteal fossa and the popliteal vein is identified. 
As before, it is checked for competency and compressibility. It is important to note 
that proximal to an incompetent small saphenous vein, a segment of the popliteal vein 
may appear incompetent. This can be excluded by [CONTACT_794717] ( SSV) is occluded by [CONTACT_794718]. Distally a deep vein just within the fascia may be seen to extend down 
the posterior aspect of the leg this is the gastrocnemius vein. The soleal veins are 
embedded in the soleus muscle and are less easily identified than the gastrocnemius 
veins. Several soleal veins can be present. They are laterally orientated and are lower 
in the calf than the gastrocnemius veins. 
 The anterior tibial vein may be seen as the first deep communication with the popliteal 
vein. Distal to this junction the tibio-peroneal trunk veins divide to form the posterior 
tibial and peroneal veins. It is easier to trace the deep calf veins from the ankle 
proximally. Placing the transducer posterior to the medial malleolus the posterior tibial 
artery and two veins can be visualized. Augmentation of flow by [CONTACT_794719] a hand should result in good color filling. The posterior tibial veins 
should be traced proximally ensuring both are viewed along their length with no 
evidence of deep vein thrombosis. If the probe is angled slightly posterior the 
peroneal artery and veins should be visualized deep to the posterior tibial vessels. 
Placing your thumb and first finger on the anterior-medial and anterior-lateral aspects 
of the ankle and applying pressure can augment the peroneal vein flow. Placing the 
transducer on the anterior aspect of the ankle the anterior tibial artery and veins can 
be visualized and traced to the proximal calf. 
 All deep calf veins should be checked for patency, competency and compressibility 
and details recorded. 
1.4 Assessment of superficial veins : Returning to the groin and moving distally along 
the common femoral vein, the great saphenous vein will appear as a superficial 
medial tributary. Care should be taken to view both color flow and perform Doppler 
assessment to determine whether the saphenofemoral junction is competent or 
incompetent. The sample volume should be placed immediately distal to the SFJ 
within the first 3 cm of the great saphenous vein (GSV). As for the deep veins 
augmentation of flow by [CONTACT_794720] a negative 
deflection on the spectral display. On release of the calf pressure, reflux will be seen 
as a positive deflection of greater than 0.5 seconds. A positive deflection of less than 
0.5 seconds is probably due to valve closure and should be ignored. The great 
saphenous should be traced along its length as isolated segments of incompetence 
and perforators may be identified. Any incompetent tributaries/perforators should be 
noted. The probe should be regularly turned to cross-section as perforators may be 
missed in longitudinal views. The great saphenous vein diameter (mm)) should be 
measured [ADDRESS_1096267]’s lap and the leg is slightly flexed at the knee and relaxed. When 
standing the leg must be slightly flexed and this position makes identification of the 
superior branch and posterior thigh connections and incompetence easier to identify.

Page [ADDRESS_1096268] be viewed proximal and distal to the saphenopopliteal junction 
(SPJ) to determine whether the junction is incompetent. Incompetence can be 
proximal into the superior branch of the small saphenous. In some cases a SPJ may 
not be identified and the SSV may communicate with the vein of Giacomini, which lies 
just beneath the fascia and extends into the proximal posterior thigh. The diameter of 
the SSV should be measured 5cm distal to the junction.

    FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  
1 INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]G E 
Varithena™ (polidocanol injectable foam ) is indicated for the treatment of incompetent great saphenous 
veins, accessory saphenous veins and visible varicosities of the great saphenous vein (GSV) system 
above and below the knee.  Varithena™ improves the symptoms of superficial venous incompetence and 
the appearance of visible varicosities. 
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
For intravenous use only. 
Varithena™ is intended for intravenous injection using ultrasound guidance, administered via a single 
cannula into the lumen of the target incompetent trunk vein s or by [CONTACT_794722] .  Use 
up to 5 ml per injection and no more than 15 mL per session. Physicians administering Varithena™ must be exper ienced with venous procedures, possess a detailed 
working knowledge of the use of the duplex ultrasound in venous disease and be trained in the 
administration of Varithena™ . 
Activate Varithena™ using the Varithena™ Oxygen Canister and Polidocanol C anister (see Instructions 
for Use). Once a Varithena™ Transfer Unit is in place, foam can be generated and transferred to a 
syringe . Discard the syringe contents if there are any visible bubbles.  Administer the injectable foam 
within 75 seconds of extraction from the canister to maintain injectable foam properties. Use a new 
sterile syringe after each injection. Use a new Varithena™ Transfer Unit for each treatment session. 
Local anesthetic may be administered prior to cannula insertion but neither tumescent anesthesia nor 
patient sedation is required.  Cannulate the vein to be treated using ultrasound guidance to confirm 
venous access. 
Inject freshly generated Varithena™ slowly (approximately 1 mL/second in the GSV and 0.5 mL/second 
in accessory veins or varicosities) while monitoring using ultrasound.  Confirm venospasm of the treated 
vein using ultrasound. 
When treating the proximal GSV, stop the injection when Varithena™ is 3 -5 cm distal to the 
Saphenofemoral Junction ( SFJ). 
Apply compression bandaging and stockings and have the patient walk for at least 10 minutes , while 
being monitored. Maintain compression for 2 weeks after treatment . 
Repeat treatment may be necessary if the size and extent of the veins to be treated require more than 15 
mL of Varithena™ . Separate treatment sessions by a minimum of 5 days. 
Retained coagulum may be removed by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_1516] (microthrombectomy) to improve comfort and reduce 
skin staining. 
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 
Polidocanol Solution, 180 mg/18 mL (10 mg/mL) must be activated before use.

   Once activated, Varithena is a white, i njectable foam delivering a 1% polidocanol solution. 
Each mL of Varithena™ injectable foam contains 1.3 mg of polidocanol. 
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS 
The use of Varithena™ is contraindicated in patients with: 
• known allergy to polidocanol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] 
• acute thromboembolic disease 
[ADDRESS_1096269] 10 minutes following injection 
and be prepared to treat anaphylaxis appropriately. 
5.2 Tissue Ischemia and Necrosis 
Intra -arterial injection or extravasation of polidocanol can cause severe necrosis, ischemia or gangrene 
Patients with underlying arterial disease, such as marked perip heral arteriosclerosis or thromboangiitis 
obliterans (Buerger’s Disease) may be at increased risk for tissue ischemia. If i ntra-arterial injection of 
polidocanol occurs, consult a vascular surgeon immediately. 
5.3 Venous Thrombosis 
Varithena™ can cause venous thrombosis [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Follow administration 
instructions closely and monitor for signs of venous thrombosis after treatment. Patients with reduced 
mobility, history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or recent (within 3 months) major surgery, prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_794647]. 
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 
6.1 Clinical Trials Experience 
Because clinical trials are conducted under controlled but widely varying conditions, adver se reaction 
rates observed in clinical trials of Varithena™ cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials 
of other drugs or procedures and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
A total of 1333 patients in 12 clinical trials were ev aluated for safety when treated with Varithena™ at 
dose concentrations of 0.125%, 0.5%, 1.0% or 2.0%, including 437 patients treated with Varithena™ in 
placebo -controlled clinical trials. 
Adverse reactions occurring in 3% more patients receiving Varithena™ 1% than receiving placebo are 
shown in Table 1.

c Common femoral vein thrombus extension (non- occlusive thrombi starting in the superficial vein and extending into the  
common femoral vein). 
In Varithena™ -treated patients, 80% of pain events in the treated extremity resolved within 1 week. 
In the 1333 patients treated with Varithena™, the following venous thrombus adverse events occurred: 
common femoral vein thrombus extension (2.9%), proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1.7%), distal 
DVT (1.1%), isolated gastrocnemius and soleal vein thrombosis (1.4%). 
Proximal symptomatic venous thrombi occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with Varithena™ 49% 
(n=35) of these patients required treatment with anticoagulants.  
Since Varithena™ induces thrombosis in the treated superficial veins, D-dimer is commonly elevated 
post- treatment and is not useful diagnostic ally to assess patients for venous thrombus following 
treatment with Varithena™ . 
Neurologic adverse events (cerebrovascular accident, migraines) have been reported in patients 
following administration of physician compounded foam sclerosants. None of the 1333 patients in the Varithena™ trials experienced clinically important neurological or visual adverse events suggestive of 
cerebral gas embolism. The incidence of neurologic and visua l adverse events within 1 day of treatment

      8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
8.1 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy Category C. 
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of Varithena™ in pregnant women.  Do not use 
Varithena™ during pregnancy.  
Animal Studies Developmental reproductive toxicity testing was performed in rats and rabbits using intravenous 
administration of polidocanol solution.  In rabbits, dose levels up to and including 10 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 12 times the proposed maximum human dose of 15 mL of 1% Varithena™ based on 
body surface area) did not produce any indication of adverse effects on embryo- fetal mortality, fetal 
weight or the incidences of fetal abnormalities and variants.  In rats administered 27 mg/kg/day of polidocanol solution (approximately 13.5 times the human dose based on body surface area), there were 
no adverse effects on pregnancy performance or fetal development. In a peri- and post-natal study in 
rats, dose levels of polidocanol up to 9 mg/kg/day (approximately 4.5 times the human dose based on 
body surface area) were without effects on the development of the conceptus and offspring, and at a 
dose level of 27 mg/kg/day of polidocanol solution (approximately 13.5 times the human dose based on 
body surface area), effects were confined to an equivocal reduction in body weights of first- generation 
males, and an associated equivocal delay in the age o f preputial separation.  
8.2 Labor and Delivery 
The effects of Varithena™ on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. 
8.3 Nursing Mothers 
It is not known whether polidocanol, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Varithena™, is excreted in human milk.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in nursing infants, avoid administering Varithena™ to a nursing woman. 
8.[ADDRESS_1096271] not been established. 
8.5 Geriatric Use 
Of the 1333 subjects in clinical studies treated with Varithena™ , 9.1% (n=121) were ≥65 years of age.   
No clinically important differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger patients in all studies. 
10 OVERDOSAGE 
There are no known cases of overdosage with Varithena™ .  In clinical studies, total volumes of up to 
60 mL of Varithena™ per treatment session have been administered.

 11 DESCRIPTION 
Varithena™ injectable foam contains the sclerosant, polidocanol.  It is intended for intravenous use 
only. 
Chemically, polidocanol is polyoxyl lauryl ether.  The structural formula is represented below: 
Polidocanol structural formula – 9-mole adduct 
Polidocanol has the molecular formula CH 3(CH 2)11 (OCH 2CH) nOH and molecular weight 582.9 when 
the average ethylene glycol moieties is nine (n = 9).  Polidocanol is a white to almost white, waxy, 
hygroscopic solid that is soluble in water and alcohol and melts at temperatures above 20oC. 
Varithena™ is a sterile, injectable foam of an aqueous polidocanol solution (1%) contain ing the 
following inactive ingredients :  ethanol (4.2% w/w), disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (0.24% 
w/w), and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (0.085% w/w) with pH adjustment using 0.1 M sodium 
hydroxide solution and 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution to achieve a pH of 6.0-7.5. 
Activate the Varithena canister to enable foam generation from polidocanol solution, 180 mg/18 mL (10 
mg/mL) . Once activated, Varithena is a white, injectable foam del ivering a 1% polidocanol 
solution. Each mL of Varithena™ injectable foam contains 1.3 mg of polidocanol. A n activated 
canister of Varithena™ generates 90 mL of injectable foam which, following purging instructions 
contained in the IFU, is sufficient to yield 45 mL of usable injectable foam for intravenous injection . 
The polidocanol solution is stored under a carbon dioxide atmosphere in an aluminum canister prior to 
use.  The injectable foam is generated after activation of the polidocanol canister with oxygen from a second 
aluminum canister , result ing in a final gas mixture of oxygen:carbon dioxide in a ratio of 65:35 with low 
(<0.8%) nitrogen content.  At the time of use, Varithena™ is generated as an injectable foam of 
controlled density and bubble size.  The foam is then transferred to a syringe through the Varithena™ 
Transfer Unit .  The injectable foam has a liquid to gas ratio of approximately 1:7 by [CONTACT_8544]. The 
median bubble diameter is less than 100 µm and no bubbles are greater than 500 µm.

  12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG Y 
12.1 Mechanism of Action 
Varithena™ is drug/device combination product that generates injectable foam.  The injectable foam is 
composed of a liquid and gas phase, both of which are necessary to have its therapeutic effect.  
Varithena™ is intended to act as follows: (1) the foam displaces b lood from the vein to be treated, (2) 
thepolidocanol then scleroses the endothelium. 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient of Varithena™ is polidocanol, a non-ionic surfactant sclerosing 
agent. The hydrophobic pole of the polidocanol molecule attaches to the lipid cell membrane of the 
venous endothelium, resulting in disruption of the osmotic barrier, destruction of the venous 
endothelium, and vasospasm. Following exposure to polidocanol, the interior surface of the vein becomes thrombogenic, which leads to thrombus formation and venous occlusion. The occluded vein is 
eventually replaced by [CONTACT_794723]. Polidocanol is deactivated upon contact [CONTACT_794724], thus limiting the sclerosant action to the endothelium near the site of injection. 
12.2 Pharmacodynamics 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Varithena™ is polidocanol.  Polidocanol has a concentration 
dependent damaging effect on the endothelium of blood vessels. 
12.3 Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of Varithena™ (as a weighted su m of 4 oligomers: E5, E9, E12 and E14) were 
evaluated at two concentrations (1% and 2%) randomly assigned within gender in 20 patients with GSV incompetence. 
When administered as an intravenous injectable foam as two fixed 5 mL doses separated by 10 minut es, 
polidocanol was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_794648], reaching maximum concentration of drug in the body after 
dosing (C
max ) within [ADDRESS_1096272] injection and within 5 mins of receiving the second injection 
of Varithena™ 1% or Varithena™ 2%. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) of polidocanol ranged 
from 3 5L to 82L. 
Mean systemic clearance (CL) of polidocanol ranged from 0.2 to 0.4 L/min. The clearance of E5 was 
significantly greater than is that of longer oligomers. Mean terminal elimination half- life (t 1/2 ) ranged 
from [ADDRESS_1096273] plasma samples below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) at the end of 
the 8 hour collection period. The increase in p lasma polidocanol concentrations was less than 
proportional with increasing Varithena™ concentration. Weight normalized data demonstrated no 
consistent differences in C max or AUC between males and females. 
[ADDRESS_1096274] not be en performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential of 
Varithena™ .  No mutagenic activity was observed in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay at non -
toxic concentrations.  No mutagenic activity was observed in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay in the 
absence of S9 mix and was weakly mutagenic in the presence of S9 close to the limit of acceptance for

      the accompanying level of toxicity.  No micronucleus induction was detected in the in vivo assay on 
mouse bone marrow cells up to the maximum tolerated d ose of 80 mg/kg. 
There was no adverse effect on fertility in both male and female rats at 27 mg/kg/day.  This dose level is 
approximately 13.5 times the proposed maximum human dose based on body surface area. 
13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology 
The pharmacological effects of polidocanol solution on the renal function of the rat were evaluated and 
at the highest dose tested (10 mg/kg) hematuria occurred in 67% of animals.  This dose is 5 times higher than the proposed maximum human dose based on body surface area. Blood was no longer detectable in 
urine 24 hours after dosing.  In the 28 day repeated dose toxicity study in rat blood pi[INVESTIGATOR_794649], including male controls, at the end of the 4 week 
treatment period with up to 27 mg polidocanol/kg/day. Following the 2 week recovery period there was still evidence that blood pi[INVESTIGATOR_794650].  There were no histopathological findings in the urinary 
bladder in any study animals.  
In a cardiovascular pharmacology study in the anesthetized dog at 20 mg/kg (approximately 33 times the 
human dose based on body surface area) statistically significantly higher values for P -Q interval were 
measured before and during dosing and at all time points up to 30 minutes after dosing. An increase in 
QRS interval was also measured after dosing of 20 mg/kg and at [ADDRESS_1096275] was short lived and was no longer seen at 15 minutes after dosing.  In addition, there was an 
increase in diastolic pressure with increasing dose of polidocanol.  This increase became significantly greater (p<0.05) than baseline before injection of the final and highest dose (20 mg/kg). 
In a further cardiovascular pharmacology study conducted with a once weekly, for four weeks, 
intravenous bolus injection of Varithena™ in the conscious dog, dose levels of up to 8.0 mL/kg 
(approximately 17 times the human dose based on bod y surface area) to beagle dogs caused only a 
transient, but consistent, effect on respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], evidenced by a decrease in tidal volume and RMV at [ADDRESS_1096276]-dose. Histopathology of the lung at the end of the 3 month follow -up period showed no abnormalities. 
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 
Varithena™ was evaluated in two randomized, blinded, multicenter clinical trials designed to assess the 
efficacy and safety of VARITHENA 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0% ( VANISH -1) and V arithena™ 0.5% and 
1.0% ( VANISH -2) compared with placebo in the treatment of both symptoms and appearance in 
patients with SFJ incompetence as evidenced by [CONTACT_794678]. In both 
studies, a Varithena™ 0.125% treatment group was included as a control for blinding of the duplex 
ultrasound assessment.  Patients with history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, inability to comply with post- treatment compression due to severe peripheral arterial disease or leg obesity , 
incompetence of the small saphenous vein or deep venous reflux as a major source of reflux, or reduced 
mobility, or major surgery, pregnancy, or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] 3 months were excluded. Patients were randomized in an equal distribution to each treatment group; t he primary time point for 
analyses of the primary, secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoints was Week 8 .

higher scores indicate more severe venous dis ease. In VANISH-1 and VANISH -2, the adjusted mean 
change s from baseline in VCSS in the 1% Varithena™ treatment group s were 3.70 and 5.05, 
respectively, at Week 8 compared with 0.75 and 1.52 points in the placebo gr oups, respectively. For 
both studies, the differences between these improvements are statistically significant ( P<0.0001). 
The physiological response to treatment as measured by [CONTACT_136665] (duplex response) was 
defined as elimination of reflux through the SFJ and/or complete occlusion of all incompetent GSV and 
major accessory veins at baseline. The primary comparison for duplex response in both studies was the 
pooled Varithena™ groups versus the Varithena™ 0.125% (control) group. Results are shown 
in Table 4.

Varithena (polidocanol injectable foam) Delivery System IFU  
Page [ADDRESS_1096279].  
 
The Instructions for Use are for the entire Varithena system. There are 2 packaging configurations:  
Option A:   Bi-Canister box and Administration Pack*  
Option B:  Convenience box (Bi -Canister Box + 3 Ancillary Packs + 3 Varithena transfer units)*  
*The components in each packaging configuration are to be used only in conjunction with each other for activation of Varithena. 
Administration Packs can be used for either configuration for further treatment sessions.  
 
Always write the activation date and time on the canister and verify the product has not expi[INVESTIGATOR_794652].  
 
Once the Varithena canister has been activated, the shelf life for t he product is thirty days.  
Rx Only  
A canister of Varithena generates 90mL of foam which, following purging instructions contained in this IFU, is 
sufficient to yield 45mL of usable foam for injection. The gas mix of the foam is 65:35 O
2:CO 2. 
 WARNINGS:  
As the foam fills the syringe and before injecting, inspect the syringe full of foam for any visible bubbles. If 
there are any present, the foam should be emptied into the Varithena transfer unit waste chamber and the 
syringe refilled.  
 Do not shake Varithena canisters.  
 Always use a fresh pair of sterile gloves when handling the Bi -Canister and Varithena transfer unit.  
 A new Varithena transfer unit must be used for each treatment session. 
 
Notes:  Use a new sterile syringe after each injection. Never fill a  syringe until just before the foam is required.  
The activated Varithena canister should always be stored with a Varithena transfer unit in place in the upright 
position at controlled room temperature in an appropriately controlled clean area to limit cont amination. 
 Use foam  within [ADDRESS_1096280] and generate new foam .

  Preparing the Patient  
 
Preparations for treating the patient with Varithena  should include the following steps:  
 
• Position the patient comfortably on the treatment table in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_794653].  
 
• Use ultrasound to find the best site for venous access.  
 
• Using an aseptic technique, infiltrate the skin over the venous access point 
with local anesthetic.  
 
• Obtain venous access under ultrasound guidance. 
 
• IV catheters that are 16 to 22 gauge and 40 - to 50 - mm long or 
micropuncture sets are recommended for venous access. 
 
• Prefill the manometer tube with sterile heparinized  normal saline solution and 
connect to the IV catheter.  
 
• Confirm venous access by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_123062] a syringe, blood should be dark and 
under low pressure.  
 
• Flush the IV catheter and manometer tube with heparinized normal saline and 
secure it to the skin with adhesive tape, leave the saline syringe connected.  
 
• With the IV catheter  in place and secure, place the patient supi[INVESTIGATOR_794654] 45 degrees.

syringe, a process that takes less than [ADDRESS_1096285], gently press down on the Varithena transfer unit to 
begin the purge cycle (Figure 17) . 
 
Visually inspect the flowing foam inside the Varithena transfer unit to make sure the  visible air bubbles have 
been expelled (less than 1 second) before releasing the syringe  plunger and allowing it to fill to the desired 
volume (Figure 18) . 
 
Draw up to 5mL of foam into the syringe.  
 
 
 
Figure 17   
Figure 18  
 
 
   
 Important Note:  Foam must be generated by [CONTACT_794731] (aspi[CONTACT_35254]).

After the silicone- free syringe has filled to the desired volume, 
wait 10 seconds to allow the pressure to equalize before 
removing the syringe from the Varithena transfer unit (Figure 
19). 
 
 
WARNING : As the foam fills the syringe and before injecting, 
inspec t the syringe full of foam for any visible bubbles 
(easily seen with the unaided eye at arm’s length). If there are 
any present, empty the foam into the Varithena transfer unit 
waste chamber and refill the syringe.  
 
[ADDRESS_1096286] it for visible bubbles (Figure 20) .  
 
 
If no visible bubbles are present then the foam is ready for use.  
 
 
Use the f oam within [ADDRESS_1096287] 
and generate new foam.  
 
 
WARNING: The total amount of foam injected in any one 
treatment session must not exceed 15mL, comprised of 
individual injections of up to 5mL each.  
 
After each treatment  session, mark -off on the canister label the 
number of aliquots of up to 5mL of usable foam drawn from the 
canister per step 11 (Figure 21) . 
 
 
Figure [ADDRESS_1096288] a syringe of freshly generated foam to the manometer

 Do not remove Varithena transfer unit if the Varithena canister is to be stored (see Storage)  
 
Change sterile gloves appropriately, to limit any contamination of the Varithena transfer unit and Bi -
Canister.  
 
Compression Pads  
 
15 
Once treatment is complete, the Compression Pads should be used: 
 
The objective of the pads is to focus the compression forces on the treated vein to keep them as free from 
blood as possible,  thus minimizing retained thrombus.  
 
The compression pads supplied should be placed along the course of the treated trunk vein in the thigh, and 
over raised treated varicose veins above and below the knee. The pads may be shaped to follow the course of 
the veins. The pads should be placed outside the first layer of limited stretch bandage and held in place by a 
second layer of bandage.  
 The appropriate length compression stocking is then applied.

Use of Varithena® to manage patients with GSV-derived venous hypertension and chronic 
venous leg ulcer 
 
Abstract: 
Venous leg ulceration (VLU) is increasingly prevalent with advancing age and places a large 
health care burden on western societies approximating to 1% of total health spending . 
Patients with VLU frequently suffer for months and years without adequate investigation or 
treatment of the underlying cause. This is in part a result of the view that ulcers should be 
healed first before intervention. Modern minimally invasive treatment can be delivered with 
little disruption to the patient and will contribute to ulcer healing and very significant reduction 
in risk of ulcer recurrence. Arguably chemical ablation of the trunk and tributary veins is most 
flexible and the least invasive of all technologies and so best suited to the elderly ulcer 
patient with complex vein disease. 
In this report the authors present their consensus opi[INVESTIGATOR_794656] 1% (Varithena®). 
 
Introduction: 
Venous leg ulcer (VLU) is the culmination of years of chronic venous insufficiency. In cases 
of severe venous obstruction this process can be reduced to a few years between the 
thrombotic incident and ulceration. In the majority, however, injury develops over decades 
with incremental damage to the skin until the point at which the skin can no longer be 
sustained and an ulcer develops . Chronic venous disease, whether due to superficial or 
deep system incompetence, is prevalent. In fact, some epi[INVESTIGATOR_794657] 56% of men and 60% of women suffer from superficial venous disease and associated 
sequelae1. The prevalence of VLU is approximately 1-2% of the population, with reports of 
5% of older adults suffering from ulceration2. In Europe and North America venous disease 
has a substantial  healthcare burden in  excess of  $ 14Bn each year (not including out of 
pocket or indirect cost s), and more than 1% of overall health care costs (Bergan JJ)3,4. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_794658] (QoL) on the 
individual , in most countries a systematic approach to reduce the burden of VLU has not 
been adopted even though there is clear evidence that venous interventions designed to 
correct underlying venous insufficiency can significantly reduce the absolute number of 
ulcers and associated cost.5,[ADDRESS_1096294] the underlying superficial venous reflux, established that correction of 
reflux reduced 12-month ulcer recurrence.7 In the [LOCATION_006] the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence reviewed the available data (2013) and concluded that patients with skin 
Version 1.0, 05Jun2017 
changes or active ulcerations should be referred to a venous specialists and to undergo 
correction of the underlying pathology where appropriate.[ADDRESS_1096295] patients fail to receive appropriate 
investigation or if investigated they still fail to receive timely intervention . With the availability 
of modern, minimally-invasive ablative techniques the arguments for delaying intervention 
are misplaced . The use of foamed sclerosant to ablate distal tributaries feeding the ulcer bed 
offers simple, effective treatment at the bedside. Foam allows for a less invasive approach to 
treating venous hypertension above the knee, while ablating distal veins with reflux that lead 
to skin changes below the knee, which may lead to more rapid healing of VLUs.  The use of 
foams to treat patients with VLUs has increased with data to support the efficacy in 
expediting healing and reducing recurrence. 9,10 FDA-approved endovenous microfoam , 
Varithena®, offers improved safety profile and reduced risk of central complications such as 
neurological adverse events compared with air based physician compounded foam.[ADDRESS_1096296] had empi[INVESTIGATOR_794659]® endovenous 
microfoam  to directly address the cause of the venous leg ulcer. 
 
Diagnosis : As with all vein disease, the primary mode of diagnosis is with duplex ultrasound 
and color flow mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
1. Proximal incompetence in the saphenous system is identified and the relative 
contribution to overall incompetence is determined.  
2. It is important to develop a complete venous map down to the ulcer area, noting sources 
of retrograde flow and re-entry perforators.  
a. In instances of leg ulcer it is beneficial for the physician and Registered 
Vascular Technologist ( RVT) to map the routes of incompetence together. 
Veins should be traced towards the ulcer with scanning performed through 
the ulcer bed to determine their termination.  
b. Incompetent and dilated perforators that do not connect to superficial veins 
and conduct blood towards the foot, are re-entry perforators and are not 
contributing to overall venous hypertension.(diagram)  
3. The majority of venous leg ulcers are caused by [CONTACT_794732]. These 
are all within the label treatment for Varithena® chemical ablation. A small number of 
ulcers are caused by [CONTACT_794733], usually occupying the lateral 
aspect of the leg.  
Version 1.0, 05Jun2017 
4. It is important to inspect the deep veins that the perforators connect to for competence. 
The presence of deep vein incompetence is not an absolute contra-indication to 
superficial vein treatment . The relative importance of superficial to deep incompetence is 
based on the duplex findings. If the superficial incompetence is dominant then its 
elimination will still yield benefit and may result in correction of the deep vein 
incompetence when the physiological disturbance and pressure (or ‘overload’) is 
eliminated. Some superficial veins feeding the ulcer are very superficial and can be seen 
visually and palpated. For these veins, ultrasound examination should be conducted with 
ample gel and minimal pressure so as not to occlude the vein with the probe and yield a 
false negative result. 
 
Exclusion of other potential causes : The patient population with leg ulceration are 
predominantly older and have consequentially more co-morbidities. It is important to 
consider the comorbidities when making the diagnosis. Arterial disease is the most common 
co-existing disease. Ankle brachial pressure indices (ABI) should be measured in all cases 
and validated with Doppler pulse wave profiles or photoplethysmography ( PPG ) pulsatility, if 
available, beware of calcified vessels giving erroneously elevated ABI values. Reduced ABI 
may suggest the need for future arterial by[CONTACT_6476]; this should be considered before ablating 
the GSV. ABI as low as 0.[ADDRESS_1096297] of venous insufficiency 
since the calf pump is not engaged to facilitate emptying of the vessels. Patients with 
significant mobility restrictions should be monitored after treatment as per current practice 
since they are at an increased risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   
Rarer causes of ulcer should be considered but not limited to vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis 
and neoplasia.  
Morbid obesity and diabetes should be addressed and should be referred to a specialist 
physician or group for assistance.  
 
Treatment:  Treatment of patients with VLU is similar to patients with saphenofemoral 
junction (SFJ) and trunk vein incompetence, with additional emphasis on following and 
ablating any incompetent tributary varicose veins towards the ulcer. Treatment should be 
Version 1.0, 05Jun2017 
performed with the leg elevated 30-45 degrees before treatment to empty the superficial 
veins.    
Pre-operative marking is important to trace the varicosities towards the site of the ulcer. 
Frequently there may be a single dilated vein which may communicate with a perforator 
under the ulcer bed. The course of the vein(s) is mapped and marked using duplex 
ultrasound with the patient standing immediately before starting the procedure .  The distal 
portion may be more easily mapped with the patient on the table in reverse Trendelenburg 
(foot down) in which case it is important to apply copi[INVESTIGATOR_794660]. When multiple vessels have been identified, venous access should 
be obtained for each of the incompetent tributaries below the knee and towards the 
lipodermatosclerotic (LDS) skin or ulcer . If multiple incompetent vessels are identified they 
should be mapped and multiple venous access points planned. 
 
As with the normal Varithena® procedure, injection of distal varices is accomplished from the 
access point and with a finger applying gentle pressure proximal to the access site. The 
foam is then injected at a steady rate (0.5-1 ml/s) and will travel distally. It remains important 
to monitor the re-entry perforators and not to permit foam to flow freely into the deep system. 
At the moment the foam column reaches the immediate intersection of superficial vein and 
perforator, the skin over the perforator is compressed and pressure above the access point 
is released. If there is significant extension of the incompetent vein beyond this point 
additional access with a butterfly needle will permit more distal filling. Forced dorsiflexion of 
the ankle (e.g. tell the patient to act as if they were pressing a gas pedal) will limit flow into 
the perforators, and repeated pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_794661]. 
 
When all incompetent veins approaching or under the ulcer have been filled, or the 
maximum volume of Varithena® has been administered (15 ml/treatment) the procedure is 
complete . Secondary and additional treatments may be necessary if the condition is bilateral 
or if the varicosities are extensive and extremely tortuous . . As described in the Instructions 
For Use it is important to ensure that the treating physician is able to visualise the column of 
Varithena that is being injected. Varithena is relatively echogenic given the gas fraction and 
so this should be straightforward and this feature also allows close control of the foam 
column to ensure that it only passes along the target vessels. Digital compression or 
dorsiflexion of the ankle can be employed to minimise the risk of unintended passage of 
Varithena into the deep venous system via the perforators.  
 
Version 1.0, 05Jun2017 
Post treatment compression  The wound needs routine care after it has been exposed for 
treatment and should be cleaned with simple non-allergenic fluids, covered by [CONTACT_105]-adherent 
dressings and finally, compression bandaging. The leg should not be lowered before 
application of compression has been completed. The pressure applied by [CONTACT_794734].  The patient should be 
instructed to wear the compression bandaging for 48h. As for most leg ulcers, a once a week 
dressing change is sufficient .  Dressings combined with multi–layer bandage and 20- 30 
mmHg thigh stocking will be adequate. 
 
Special considerations 
Incompetent perforators: Varithena® is not indicated for perforator treatment. However,   if 
the superficial vein above and below the perforator is ablated there should be no flow in the 
perforator. In the rare case where a functionally incompetent perforator persists and is 
contributing to venous hypertension, it may be ablated with other techniques. 
 
Preparation:  Thorough skin prep of the leg and ulcer should take place using iodine, 
starting in the thigh and working distally towards, and including, the ulcer assuming there is 
no known allergy to iodine. Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. 
 
Venous access:  Access of the feeding vein to the ulcer can be made using the device of 
choice. Butterfly needles (21 or 23 G) are preferred and they should have  a long extension 
tube. Alternatively, and when there is a straighter segment of vein, a venous access kit using 
the sleeve will provide secure access.  In some cases, simple IV catheters can be used . 
Small gauge needles (>25G) and catheters should be avoided as they are too flexible and 
result in high velocity jets of foam which encourage mixing of foam and blood. 
 
Follow-up:  Routine follow-up should be provided with an assessment at [ADDRESS_1096298]-
treatment when dressings should be changed. At this time, a duplex assessment for 
completeness of treatment should be conducted. Reflux time and vein patency should be 
documented. Additional Varithena® treatment may be provided at this time if needed. 
Because veins in the ulcerated limb are frequently larger and more extensive, additional 
treatments are more common than for routine varicose vein patients.

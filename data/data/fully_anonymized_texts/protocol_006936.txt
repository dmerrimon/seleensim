Page 2 of 18Revised: January 10, [ZIP_CODE])Objectives*
We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_505368], Multiple Assignment randomized clinical trial 
(SMART) incorporating nicotine replacement treatment (NRT), contingency 
management (CM), and mindfulness training (MT) to identify the optimal 
dynamic strategy to promote biomarker-confirmed smoking abstinence among 
people living with HIV (PLWH). 
2)Background*
Mindfulness training (MT) is an approach that has become more widely used for 
the purposes of smoking cessation. MT can operationalized into two components: 
1) maintaining attention on immediate experience, and 2) maintaining an attitude 
of acceptance toward that experience, which can improve individuals’ ability to 
avoid absorption in maladaptive mental patterns, behaviors, and emotional 
reactions that lead to depression.[1,2] _ENREF_40  MT is effective in reducing 
both self-report and objective indices of negative affect and psychological 
stress.[3,4] MT also can help smokers control craving by [CONTACT_505377].[5] 
The use of MT for smoking cessation, however, has not been tested among 
Hispanics HIV patients who smoke. We, therefore, propose to test the feasibility, 
acceptability, and potential efficacy of a mindfulness smoking cessation 
intervention among Hispanics HIV patients that smoke. CM is an evidence-based 
behavioral intervention where individuals receive escalating tangible 
reinforcement for biologically confirmed substance abstinence.[6] CM has been 
successful in retaining patients in treatment and fostering stable periods of 
abstinence in substance use behavioral research, including tobacco.[7-9] In HIV 
patients, CM was feasible and effective in improving compliance to ART[10] and 
reducing HIV risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, injection drug use).[11] CM 
may as well reduce the economic stressor for smoking cessation (e.g., 
unemployment) in HIV patients. [12,13] Yet, no studies to date tested CM to 
promote smoking cessation among HIV smokers. In our survey among HIV 
smokers, 45.7% were interested in CM to quit smoking. Therefore, CM may serve 
as an ideal adjunct intervention to MT to promote long-term abstinence in HIV 
smokers.

randomized into one of two groups: 1) a group mindfulness training (MT) for smoking 
cessation, or 2) contingency management (CM) for smoking cessation. In Stage 2 non-
-       Study #: 20201296        Effective Date: 5/9/2025
Page 4 of 18Revised: January 10, 2023responders (those who have not quit at 1 month evaluation) will be randomized to: 1) 
Switch to sequentially receive the other intervention (i.e., CM or MI) and complete the 3-
month assessment; or 2) Continue without further intervention and complete the 3-month 
assessment only. 
In stage 1, both groups will do the following:
•Complete a baseline survey. 
•Receive 6 weeks of Nicotine Replacement Treatment (NRT) via mail
•Receive reminder/encouragement calls or texts the day before their quit 
date and 2 weeks after their quit date.
Arm 1:  The MT smoking cessation intervention: 
Participants will attend an orientation session via Zoom or in person to introduce 
them to mindfulness, smoking cessation, and what is covered in the group 
sessions. This orientation will last 60-90 minutes. They will receive twice weekly 
group sessions (eight total during 4 weeks) via Zoom or in person that were 
manualized and will be delivered in Spanish or English by a Hispanic instructor(s) 
experienced in MT (a single therapi[INVESTIGATOR_58452] >4 years of training in MT). We will e-
mail participants study materials ahead of the first group session, such as the 
participant study booklet. We will also communicate with participants using 
WhatsApp to send them reminders and links to mindfulness recordings.
The overarching theme of momentary awareness and acceptance of cravings and 
affect (e.g., stress, anxiety etc.) will be introduced and reinforced in 
complementary ways throughout the training. Each session will last 45-60 
minutes.
a.Session (1): Will introduce participants to the concept of how smoking can 
become a habituated behavior triggered by [CONTACT_505378], physical, or mental 
stimulus through associative learning. It also will explore how cravings feel in the 
body and how MT can help individuals become more aware of these processes. 
b.Session (2): Will examine how thoughts, emotions and body sensations 
become triggers for craving and smoking and introduce a technique to ‘mindfully’ 
work with cravings (Recognize, Accept, Investigate and Note what cravings feel 
like as they arise; acronym: RAIN). 
c.Session (3): Will introduce how difficult emotions perpetuate smoking as well 
as a standard meditation technique called loving-kindness as a way to work with 
them. Loving-kindness is practiced through directed well wishing, typi[INVESTIGATOR_505369] ‘may X be happy.’ 
d.Session (4) (quit date): Will teach participants how cravings thwart long-term 
goals, and reinforce mindfulness techniques as a way to help individuals 
disengage from habitual responding and realign with their goals. 
e.Session (5): Will introduce participants to mindfulness practice in everyday 
life, including “awareness of breath” meditation and mindful walking (“four 
modes of walking”, during which individuals practice systematically noting 
-       Study #: 20201296        Effective Date: 5/9/2025
Page 5 of 18Revised: January 10, 2023objects that they see, and then objects that they hear, then objects that they smell, 
and then tactile objects such as the pressure of their feet on the ground). 
f.Session (6): Will explore the automaticity of thought, and how thoughts can 
lead to habitual behaviors. 
g.Session (7): Will reinforce the concept of acceptance and its role in changing 
habits. It will also explore how both mental and physical actions can “plant seeds” 
for future actions and habits. 
h.Session (8): Will summarize the course tools and explore ways of maintaining 
these in the future. Home practice will be suggested after each session as a 
combination of formal MT meditations (the “body scan” which teaches 
individuals to systematically pay attention to different parts of their bodies as a 
way to reduce habitual mind-wandering and strengthen their attentional 
capacities, loving-kindness, and awareness of breath, which through focused 
attention on the breath also is intended to help individuals retrain their minds from 
habitually engaging in self-related pre-occupations -such as thinking about the 
past or future, or reacting to stressful stimuli- to more present moment 
awareness), and informal practices (four modes of walking, mindfulness of daily 
activities, mindfulness of smoking, RAIN). Participant will receive meditation 
recordings to practice.
Participants will receive a weekly phone call to ask a few questions on their use of 
the mindfulness practices taught in the sessions. This will take about 5 minutes.
Participants will receive $20 for completing the baseline assessment, $10 for 
attending each of the 8 sessions, $10 for the end of the treatment assessment, and 
$25 for the 3-month follow up assessment (a total of $135).
Arm 2:  Contingency Management (CM) Smoking Cessation Intervention
Participants in this arm will attend an orientation session via Zoom that will last 
60-[ADDRESS_652010] 7-day smoking, and provide a sample of CO to 
verify their smoking status after their quit date using a portable CO monitor 
(coVita iCO™ Smokerlyzers®) and/or NicoTests saliva screen test that has been 
mailed to them. Those who proved their abstinence (CO< 8 ppm using coVita 
iCO™ Smokerlyzers®) and/or 30 ng/mL using NicAlert) [14] will receive a cash 
reward. The first successful CO sample earns $[ADDRESS_652011] 
increases by $2 for each consecutive successful CO and/or saliva sample (e.g., $5, 
$7, $9...). Participants also earn $2 bonus for 4 consecutive successful CO and/or 
saliva samples (total=$4). In all, participants can earn a maximum of $176. 
Participant who fail the CO and/or saliva test will not receive reinforcement and 
the value of the next payment will be reset to the one that was missed.
 
-       Study #: 20201296        Effective Date: 5/9/2025
Page 6 of 18Revised: January 10, 2023All participants will be asked to complete an end of treatment assessment 2 weeks after 
the intervention ends, which will be the same as the 3-month follow-up described below. 
Breath CO and/or saliva sample test (for cotinine analysis) will be collected at the end of 
treatment assessment via Zoom for participants who report they have quit.
All participants will be asked to complete a follow-up assessment 3 months after their 
quit date to assess their smoking status as well as get information about concomitant 
smoking and NRT use, use of additional NRT or cessation drugs (e.g., bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]), and 
use of other tobacco methods.  Breath CO and/or saliva sample test (for cotinine analysis) 
will be collected at the 3-month follow-up points for participants who report abstinence. 
The breath sample will be collected with the portable CO monitor (coVita iCO™ 
Smokerlyzers®) and/or NicoTests saliva screening test. A cut-off of [ADDRESS_652012] 
(using coVita iCO™ Smokerlyzers®) and/or ≤ 30 ng/mL for the saliva sample test 
(using NicoTests) will be used to determine abstinence (Benowitz et al 2002).

Page 9 of 18Revised: January 10, [ZIP_CODE])Data and Specimen Banking*
 There will be no data or specimen banking.
7)Data Management*
The analysis of the feasibility and acceptability outcomes will be mainly 
descriptive. We will calculate differences in pre and post intervention 
measures of baseline characteristics, indices of treatment implementation, 
adherence, retention, and treatment perceptions and compare the 
differences between arms [ADDRESS_652014] maximum likelihood estimation and 
multiple imputation will be used to address incomplete data. Univariate 
and multivariable logistic regression models will be used to explore 
baseline predictors of 3-month smoking cessation and the acceptability 
and feasibility of the intervention. Cross-tabulations for ordinal variables 
and mean and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for continuous 
variables will be used to explore secondary outcomes including 
improvement in depression, smoking self-efficacy, craving, quality of life, 
and mindfulness skills. Although we are unpowered to detect differences 
by [CONTACT_547], we will consider exploring the gender effect on our main 
outcomes in our analysis. Data management for preparing data for 
statistical analysis and statistical analysis will be performed with SAS or R 
statistical software.
Qualitative analyses of semi-structured post-intervention evaluation 
interviews will identify emergent themes related to acceptability and 
specific targets for refinement of content and delivery. Interviews will be 
audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using Nvivo. This 
program is designed for the storage, coding, retrieval, and analysis of 
qualitative data. Two complementary coding schemes will be used: 1) 
descriptive, which uses words or short phrases to summarize passages of 
data and 2) in Nvivo, in which actual language from participants is used to 
name [CONTACT_341766]. Extensive analytic memos will be written after 
each interview is conducted, coded, and throughout the analysis process to 
reflect on code choices, emergent themes and patterns, and conceptual 
models. Finally, the data will be themed, in which the final sets of codes 
and their meanings will be transformed into longer and more descriptive 
themes to organize recurrent meanings and patterns. Themes and 
definitions will be compared across interviews to ensure consistency and 
reliability.  
Statistical analyses will be done using SPSS, V21, 
(https://www.ibm.com/analytics/spss-statistics-software). 
All study data will be entered and captured by [CONTACT_61604], which provides secure 
data capture for clinical and non–clinical research studies. 
-       Study #: 20201296        Effective Date: 5/9/2025
Page 10 of 18Revised: January 10, [ZIP_CODE])Risks to Subjects*
The risks to subjects, immediate and long range, are considered minimal. Study 
participants will be asked to complete questionnaires before and after receiving 
advice to quit smoking, either self-help materials to quit or a behavioral 
intervention, as well as nicotine replacement for smoking cessation. It is possible 
that subjects might become psychologically distressed while completing the 
questionnaires or be dissatisfied with the self-help information or intervention. 
They will be provided with transdermal nicotine patches that are available over-
the-counter. Participants will be required to indicate whether they have any health 
conditions that may negatively interact with the patches. 
To minimize the risk of psychological distress due to questionnaire completion, 
the measures do not contain private or potentially embarrassing items, and will 
take about 30-45 minutes for completion time per assessment. To minimize the 
risk of dissatisfaction with the intervention, we will use an established 
intervention that has high efficacy. To minimize risks associated with the nicotine 
patches, subjects will be provided with thorough education of the indications for 
the nicotine patch, possible side effects, and known health conditions that 
preclude patch use. The patches are available over the counter; thus, they do not 
pose a significant health risk to most people. They contain minimal amounts of 
nicotine (which are much less than they get from smoking), and are absent the 
remaining 7,[ADDRESS_652015] personnel, is 
trained to handle situations sensitively and with empathy. All research staff are 
required to complete site mandated training on the Protection of Human Research 
Participants. 
9)Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)
Adverse events for this study may include the following:
EXPECTED:
a. Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, such as headaches, cravings, insomnia, 
anxiety, or depression.
b. Side effects of using the nicotine replacement patches, such as minor skin 
irritation or rash).
These expected AE will be recorded in the participant tracking database. Participants will 
be advised to review the materials they received on nicotine withdrawal and proper 
use of NRT patches. If unmanageable symptoms persist of withdrawal or NRT use 
-       Study #: 20201296        Effective Date: 5/9/2025
Page 11 of 18Revised: January 10, 2023persis, participants will be advised to discontinue use of NRT and see their 
physician.
UNEXPECTED
c. Unexpected negative psychological reactions to practicing mindfulness.
These unexpected AE will also be recorded in the participant tracking database. If 
negative reactions to the mindfulness practice cannot be resolved within the group 
session by [CONTACT_505380], participants will be advised see their 
physician. If severe reactions occur and cannot be resolved, study staff will call 
911. We do not expect this SAE to occur, nor are any other SAE anticipated.
10)Potential Benefits to Subjects*
Individual subjects can potentially benefit from participating in the study because 
they will have the opportunity to make a quit attempt and the possibility of long-
term smoking cessation. This is associated with a number of additional benefits 
including improved health, economic savings, the confidence and happi[INVESTIGATOR_505371]-smoker, and reducing their stress as a result to 
practicing mindfulness.
11)Vulnerable Populations*
This research study does not include vulnerable populations.
12)Setting
The primary study site is the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine 
Campus. Recruitment will mostly take place at UHealth and community clinics, 
social media (e.g., Facebook), and organizations serving people living with HIV. 
The consent process, participant assessments, and group meetings will take place 
via Zoom. 
13)Resources Available

Primary:  
•To determine the overall response rate in patients with advanced esophago-gastric cancer 
to combination pralatrexate and oxaliplatin.
Secondary:
•To examine the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen
•To determine the time-to-progression and overall survival using this regimen

Treatment Plan:
Following Vitamin B12 and folate supplementation, and appropriate anti-emetic therapy (to 
include a 5-HT [ADDRESS_482214] and a steroid), pralatrexate will be administered intravenously in a 
dose of 120 mg/m2 over 3-5 minutes followed by [CONTACT_385454] 85 mg/m2 intravenously over 
2 hours.  Cycles will be repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression, undue toxicity, or patient/physician discretion.  For patients meeting response criteria to continue therapy, oxaliplatin will be discontinued after 12 cycles (maximum cumulative dose = 1020 mg/m
2) to 
reduce the risk of peripheral neuropathy.
The safety lead-in will start at cohort 1 with six patients.  If this is tolerable, then all further 
accrual will be at this starting dose level.  If not, successively decreasing cohorts will be investigated per the following table:

Page 6 of 651. Hypothesis
The efficacy of current chemotherapy options in advanced esophago-gastric cancer has 
reached a plateau.  Investigative strategies should focus on the development of new agents and on predictive markers to tailor the efficacy of drugs to specific patient or tumor characteristics.  We hypothesize the following: 
a. The combination of pralatrexate and oxaliplatin will be efficacious and tolerable in 
patients with advanced esophago-gastric cancer.  
b. Polymorphisms in genes responsible for transport and metabolism of pralatrexate will 
correlate with response and outcome.
c. MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiles generated using cell line data can predict 
response to pralatrexate using expression profiling of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_385423]-capture microdissection (LCM).
2. Background
Cancers of the stomach and esophagus are the second and sixth most common causes of 
cancer-related mortality world-wide.
[ADDRESS_482215] cancers present at 
an advanced stage and the 5-year survival remains less than 20%.  There has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the [LOCATION_002] in the past two decades with a concurrent 7-fold increase in mortality.
[ADDRESS_482216] arise from the distal esophagus, gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) or the proximal stomach, and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_385424]-type.  There is no uniform global standard for the first-line therapy of advanced esophago-gastric cancer (EGC).  Regimens include doublet or triplet- combination chemotherapy agents, usually platinum- or fluorouracil-based with response rates ranging from 15%-50%, achieving an overall survival of 9-11 months.
3-6
Oxaliplatin, a novel antineoplastic platinum is a favorable alternative to cisplatin in terms of toxicity without compromise of efficacy.
7  It is less emetogenic, less nephrotoxic and 
less neurotoxic compared to cisplatin.  It has been widely incorporated into combination treatment regimens in advanced EGC.
8-13  Our group has systematically demonstrated the 
feasibility and efficacy of oxaliplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5FU), and with capecitabine in three successive trials in esophagus cancer (EC), all in combination with radiotherapy.
14-16  This regimen showed an impressive pathologic complete response rate 
of 33% for resectable EC in SWOG 0356, a multi-center phase II trial.[ADDRESS_482217]: 5/5/2017

a phase II trial assessing   pemetrexed (500mg/m2) in combination with oxaliplatin 
(120mg/m2) every 21 days in advanced gastric cancer demonstrated a response rate of 
36%, with four complete responses and an impressive time-to-progression of 6.2 months.
24  With the more conventionally used biweekly regimen of oxaliplatin at 
85mg/m2, pemetrexed can be safely given every 14 days at a dose of 400-500mg/m2 in 
patients without extensive prior therapy.[ADDRESS_482218] that the combination 
of oxaliplatin with the multi-targeted anti-folate pemetrexed is safe and efficacious in several tumor types, including gastric cancer.
Pre-clinical observations of increased cellular uptake and polyglutamylation of 
pralatrexate relative to other anti-folates methotrexate and pemetrexed make this an appropriate drug for study in clinical trials.
27-30  It has demonstrated synergy with 
platinum and taxane compounds.29, 31  Phase I testing has evaluated weekly, biweekly and 
every 3-week dosing with stomatitis being the dose-limiting toxicity.   The documented pre-clinical synergy with platinum makes it an ideal candidate for testing in a combination regimen.  Of note, these trials did not utilize vitamin supplementation to mitigate toxicity.  With this approach, higher doses of pralatrexate are currently being tested in clinical trials.  In a phase I study, pralatrexate at 120mg/m
2 in combination with 
docetaxel at 35mg/m2, both administered every other week was found to be safe and 
tolerable when vitamin supplementation was administered concurrently.31  
Using this information, we propose to use pralatrexate at 120mg/m2 every other week in 
combination with the standard dose of biweekly oxaliplatin (85mg/m2) in this clinical 
trial for patients with advanced EGC.  The lack of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_385425].

Response will be assessed every 8 weeks and treatment will continue until disease progression.  Oxaliplatin will be discontinued after 12 cycles of treatment to reduce the risk of neuropathy with cumulative dosing in patients with responding or stable disease.  The primary clinical end-point is response rate with secondary end-points of describing toxicity and calculating time-to-progression and overall survival. 
Blood (5ml) will be collected on all patients and sent to the Adjei laboratory for single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis.  In addition, pre-treatment primary tumor biopsies will be undertaken by [CONTACT_385455].  This will be sent to the Yendamuri laboratory. See correlative section for

5. Inclusion of Women and Minorities
Women and minorities will be eligible for this study without any alteration in the 
eligibility criteria.  National demographics for esophagus cancer indicate a relative rarity of this disease in women.  Hence only 10-15% of patients enrolled on esophagus cancer trials are women.  African-Americans comprise 5-10% of patients on esophagus cancer trials with most of these patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_385426]-cell cancer.  Our own experience suggests a similar demographic distribution and the current clinical trial would be expected to mirror a similar patient population.

Pralatrexate is a folate analogue that inhibits folate metabolism by [CONTACT_385457] (DHFR). The improved antitumor effects of pralatrexate are likely due to the more effective internalization via reduced folate transport, and the subsequent accumulation in tumor cells through the formation of polyglutamylated metabolites.

Page 9 of 65PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, PHARMACEUTICAL PROPERTIES
Pralatrexate has the chemical name (2 S)-2-[[4-[(1 RS)-1-[(2, 4-diaminopteridin-6-
yl)methyl]but-3-ynyl]benzoyl]amino]pentanedioic acid.  The structural formula is as follows:
Pralatrexate is a 1:1 racemic mixture of S- and R- diastereomers at the C10 position 
(indicated with *)
The molecular formula is C
23H23N7O5 and the molecular weight is 477.48 g/mol. 
Pralatrexate is an off-white to yellow solid.  It is soluble in aqueous solutions at pH 6.5 or higher.  Pralatrexate is practically insoluble in unbuffered water, chloroform, and ethanol.  The pKa values are 3.25, 4.76, and 6.17. 
Pralatrexate is supplied as a preservative free, sterile, isotonic, non-pyrogenic clear 
yellow aqueous parenteral solution contained in a single-use 2 mL-size clear glass vial for intravenous administration.  Each 1 mL of solution contains 20 mg of pralatrexate, 0.6% sodium chloride to achieve an isotonic (280-300 mOsm) solution, and sufficient sodium hydroxide, and hydrochloric acid if needed, to adjust and maintain the pH at 7.5-8.5.  Pralatrexate is supplied as either 20 mg (1 mL) or 40 mg (2 mL) single-use vials at a concentration of 20 mg/mL.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Pralatrexate is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that competitively inhibits DHFR.  In in 
vitro  studies, pralatrexate showed improved cytotoxic activity against a panel of cancer 
cell lines compared with methotrexate.  The improved cytotoxic activity is likely due to pralatrexate being a more efficient permeant for reduced folate transport and it being more efficiently polyglutamylated by [CONTACT_385458] (FPGS).
28, 33 Similar to what has been reported for methotrexate, cellular uptake of 
pralatrexate is thought to occur via the reduced folate carrier-1 (RFC-1) protein.  RFC-[ADDRESS_482221] as a competitive inhibitor for polyglutamylation of natural folates.  Further, it is believed N

life, thus allowing for prolonged drug action in malignant cells. 
Folic acid (folate) is a B vitamin (B 9) and serves as a carrier of 1-carbon groups in many 
metabolic reactions that are critical to the life cycle of cells.  Following absorption into the cell via RFC-1, dietary folate undergoes reduction to dihydrofolate.  Dihydrofolate is then converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF) by [CONTACT_385459].  THF is required for the synthesis and catabolism of several amino acids, formation of creatine and choline, synthesis of purines, methylation of ribonucleic acids (RNAs), and synthesis of thymidine.  Pralatrexate is a competitive inhibitor of DHFR, and thus treatment with pralatrexate will lead to depletion of thymidine and other biological molecules the synthesis of which depends on one carbon transfer.  Depletion of thymidine will result in inhibition of DNA replication and thus interference with cell proliferation.  For detailed information about the general pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), nonclinical toxicology and clinical efficacy studies of pralatrexate, refer to the current pralatrexate Investigator’s Brochure (IB) accompanying this protocol.  
PRECLINICAL INFORMATION
Data from in vitro and in vivo models of human NHL established the superior therapeutic 
activity of pralatrexate compared to methotrexate. In vitro experiments demonstrated that pralatrexate concentrations that result in 50% growth inhibition (IC
50) were consistently 
10-fold lower than that typi[INVESTIGATOR_385428] a library of lymphoma cell lines, and xenograft studies of lymphoma lines in mice consistently showed pralatrexate to be superior to methotrexate.

pralatrexate was found to be superior to both methotrexate (13- to 40-fold lower IC

CLINICAL STUDIES: HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES
Study PDX 02-078
In a “phase 2/1/2” study of pralatrexate in 57 patients with relapsed or refractory lymphomas, the initial phase 2 dose of 135 mg/m
2 every 2 weeks was associated with 
unacceptable mucositis, leading to phase 1/2 evaluation of 30 mg/m2 once weekly for 6 weeks in 7-week cycles. This schedule modification resulted in a 50% reduction in the major hematologic toxicities and abrogation of the grade 3 to 4 stomatitis. Overall response rate among assessable patients with PTCL was 54% (14/26), including 31% (8/26) with complete remission or complete remission unconfirmed, and 23% (6/26) with partial remission.

Seventy-five patients (68%) were male 34 (32%) were female. Most patients (72%) were 
White and other racial origins included: Black (12%), Hispanic (8%), Asian (6%), other and unknown (<1% each).  Patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status at study entry of 0 (39%), 1 (45%), or 2 (17%).  The median time from initial diagnosis to study entry was 15.6 months (range 0.8 – 322.3).The median number of prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 3 (range 1-12).  Approximately one-fourth of patients (24%, n = 26) did not have evidence of response to any previous therapy.  Approximately two-thirds of patients (63%, n = 69) did not have evidence of response to their most recent prior therapy before entering the study.

Overall response rate by [CONTACT_168864] 39% (n = 43). Of the responders, 63% responded by [CONTACT_385462] 1. The median time to first response was 45 days (range, 37–349 days) and the median time to best response was 96 days (range, 37–483 days). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the median duration of response and overall survival were 10.1 months (range, 1-673 days) and 14.5 months (95% CI: 11.2, not evaluable), respectively. 
The mean duration of treatment was 112 days (range, 1–558 days). Most patients (69%, 
n = 77) remained at the target dose (30 mg/m
2 for 6 of 7 weeks per cycle) for the duration 
of treatment and 85% of scheduled doses were administered. The most frequent adverse events in PROPEL, regardless of causality, were mucositis (71% All Grade, 18% Grade 3, 4% Grade 4), thrombocytopenia (41% All Grade, 14% Grade 3, 19% Grade 4), nausea (41% All Grade, 4% Grade 3, 0 Grade 4), fatigue (36% All Grade, 5% Grade 3, 2% Grade 4), anemia (34% All Grade, 16% Grade 3, 2% Grade 4), constipation (34% All Grade, 0 Grade 3, 0 Grade 4), pyrexia (34% All Grade, 1% Grade 3, 1% Grade 4), and edema (31% All Grade, 1% Grade 3, 0 Grade 4). 
There was an additional analysis of treatment responses among patients in the PROPEL

Of the [ADDRESS_482227] recent therapy, 46 (67%) received full-dose therapy and the safety and tolerability in this subset was similar to the overall study population.
The safety and management of pralatrexate treatment in relapsed or refractory PTCL 
patients included in the PDX-008 was evaluated over 3 parameters: to assess safety according to duration of pralatrexate treatment, to evaluate both early- and late- onset pralatrexate toxicities, and to assess the impact of pralatrexate dose modification on toxicities.
41  Patients received pralatrexate 30 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous push 
over 3-5 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks in 7-week cycles. All patients received vitamin B
12 (1 mg) intramuscular injection every 8-10 weeks and oral folic acid (1.0-1.25 
mg) daily. Patients with methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels ≥ 200 nmol/L or 
homocysteine (Hcy) ≥ 10 μmol/L at screening received supplementation > [ADDRESS_482228] pralatrexate dose.  Pralatrexate doses were omitted in patients with platelets <50,000/μL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 500-1,000/ μL with fever, ANC <500 μL, 
Grade 2-4 mucositis and any other Grade 3 treatment-related event. The dose was reduced to 20 mg/m
2 in patients with platelets < 25,000/ μL on 2 occurrences, recurrence 
of ANC 500-1,000 μL with fever, recurrence of ANC <500 μL, recurrence of Grade 2 
mucositis, Grade 3-4 mucositis, or any Grade 4 treatment-related event.  Of the 111 patients evaluated for safety, 109 were evaluable for efficacy. Patients received pralatrexate for a median of 70 days (range 1-696); 19 of these patients received therapy for > 180 days; and 12 received therapy for ≥ 300 days. Two or more cycles were 
delivered in 64 patients, and ≥ 3 cycles were delivered in 43 patients. The median 
cumulative dose was 207.9 mg/m
2 (range 26.7-2108.8). There were 76 patients (68%) 
who needed no dose modification. Of the remaining 35 patients (32%), dose reduction occurred in cycle [ADDRESS_482229] common reason for dose reduction was mucosal inflammation. Prior to dose modification, the frequency of Grade 2-4 mucosal inflammation was 28/35 compared with 15/[ADDRESS_482230] common adverse events in the overall population were mucosal inflammation, 
nausea, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue. There was no evidence of cumulative dose-toxicity effects. 
A additional analysis evaluated the correlation between baseline methylomalonic acid 
(MMA) status and mucositis severity in the PROPEL study, and the implications for vitamin prophylaxis.
42  In addition to MMA, homocysteine (HCY) and red blood cell 
(RBC) folate levels were evaluated to assess the association between these baseline parameters and mucositis and thrombocytopenia.  Mucositis and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse events reported in the PROPEL study. Of the 111 patients evaluated for safety, 109 were evaluable for efficacy. The following percentages of patients had baseline levels available: MMA 89%, HCY 91%, RBC folate 75%. APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

baseline MMA level. (slope estimate = 43.3 nmol/L, P=0.039). In the subset of patients enrolled in PROPEL for whom baseline MMA levels were obtained, those with higher levels of baseline MMA compared to the normal range  experienced increased severity of mucosal inflammation despi[INVESTIGATOR_385431]. Although not significant, there was a trend toward a relationship between increasing severity of thrombocytopenia and increasing MMA levels (slope estimate= 17.6 nmol/L, P=0.267). There were no significant relationships between baseline HCY and RBC folate levels and mucosal inflammation or thrombocytopenia. 
Patients with higher baseline levels of MMA experienced increased severity of mucositis. 
Based on the results of this study, vitamin supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B

pralatrexate.
Study PDX-010
An open-label phase 1 trial was conducted to examine the safety and efficacy of 
pralatrexate in relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).  Results from [ADDRESS_482231] mycosis fungoides stage 1B or higher 
(MF), Sezary syndrome (SS), or primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and progression or relapse of disease after at least 1 systemic therapy and a ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 2. The 31 evaluable patients (22 with MF, 7 with SS, 1 
with primary cutaneous ALCL, 1 with CTCL, NOS) were enrolled into 6 cohorts: pralatrexate 30 mg/m
2 for 3 of 4 weeks (n = 2), 20 mg/m2 for 3 of 4 weeks (n = 3), 20 
mg/m2 for 2 of 3 weeks (n = 7), 15 mg/m2 for 3 of 4 weeks (n = 6), 15 mg/m2 for 2 of 3 
weeks (n = 3), 10 mg/m2 for 3 of 4 weeks (n = 10). All patients received vitamin B 12 and 
folic acid supplementation. These patients were heavily pretreated with a median of 6 prior regimens (range, 1–25), and a median of 4 prior systemic regimens (range, 1–10).
Of the 31 evaluable patients, 12 achieved a response (39%), including complete response 
in 2 patients (1 each with MF/SS and primary cutaneous ALCL) and partial response in 10 patients (all with MF/SS). The ORR at pralatrexate dose intensity ≥ 15 mg/m

week was 61% (11/18). A pralatrexate dose of ≥ 15 mg/m3 seemed to be the threshold for 
substantial activity in CTCL and the optimal regimen was pralatrexate ≥ 15 mg/m3

Study PDX-009
It was demonstrated in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) cell lines in vitro and 
xenografts in vivo that pralatrexate may synergize with gemcitabine in a schedule-dependent manner.
35  pralatrexate in combination with gemcitabine is being evaluated in 
an ongoing clinical study (Study PDX-009) in patients with certain relapsed or refractory lymphoproliferative malignancies, including Hodgkin’s lymphoma and certain types of NHL (www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). (Data on file, Allos Therapeutics) The phase 1 component of the study has been completed.
44  Various doses and schedules 
were evaluated in the following treatment groups:
• Treatment Group A (n=7) : pralatrexate (15 mg/m2) followed the next day by 
[CONTACT_35421] (400 mg/m2-starting dose), administered once weekly. One cycle of 
pralatrexate and gemcitabine was [ADDRESS_482232].  Accrual was closed in this treatment group due to dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
• Treatment Group B (n=10) : pralatrexate (10 mg/m2) followed the next day by 
[CONTACT_35421] (300 mg/m2- starting dose), administered once every 2 weeks. One cycle of 
pralatrexate and gemcitabine is 4 weeks in duration consisting of 2 doses each of pralatrexate and gemcitabine.
• Treatment Group C (n=17) : pralatrexate (10 mg/m2) followed 1 hour later by 
[CONTACT_35421] (300 mg/m2- starting dose), administered once every 2 weeks. One cycle of 
pralatrexate and gemcitabine is 4 weeks in duration consisting of 2 doses each of pralatrexate and gemcitabine.
Patients were enrolled into each treatment group until the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) was determined. The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which ≤ 33% 
of patients experience a DLT. Potential DLTs in the phase 1 portion of the study included: Grade 4 neutropenia for ≥ 7 days, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or any 
thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding, ≥ Grade 3 febrile neutropenia, ≥ 
Grade 3 treatment-related nonhematological toxicity excluding nausea/vomiting in the absence of appropriate antiemetic therapy. Safety information was obtained for all patients, and patients who received ≥ 1 cycle of chemotherapy were eligible for the 
efficacy evaluation.  Of the 35 patients treated in the phase 1 component, 33 were evaluable for response. The median number of prior regimens among the 35 patients was 3 (range 1-11). Lymphoma subtypes included: B-cell (n=15 [DLBCL= 11, follicular-4]), PTCL (n=12), Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n=7), composite B- and T-cell lymphoma (n=1).

Page 16 of 65The MTD in Groups B and C were pralatrexate/gemcitabine 10/400 mg/m2, when given 
on sequential days, and pralatrexate/gemcitabine 15/600 mg/m2, when given on the same 
day. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (with either study drug) occurring in > 2 patients included anemia (29% Grade 3, 0% Grade 4), neutropenia (31% Grade 3, 11% Grade 4 ), thrombocytopenia (11% Grade 3 , 26% Grade 4 ), leukopenia (3% Grade 3, 9% Grade 4 ), and abnormal liver function test (9% Grade 3 , 0% Grade 4 ). In Group B, 33% of patients had DLTs (Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or any thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding 17%, ≥ Grade 3 febrile neutropenia 17%, ≥ Grade 3 
treatment-related nonhematological toxicity 33%). In Group C, 21% of patients had DLTs (Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or any thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding 7%, ≥ Grade 3 treatment-related nonhematological toxicity 14%). 
Response to therapy was evaluated using the International Workshop Criteria a minimum of every 3 cycles. Of the 33 evaluable patients, 8 (24%) had a partial response (Hodgkin’s lymphoma 4/7, PTCL 2/11, B-cell lymphoma 2*/15 [*1 patient with mixed B- and T-cell histology]). The authors concluded that the combination of pralatrexate and gemcitabine can be administered on a q2w schedule with acceptable toxicity. Based on the results of the study, the phase 2 component is actively accruing using the MTD in Groups B (pralatrexate [10 mg/m
2] followed the next day by [CONTACT_35421] [300 mg/m2- 
starting dose], administered once every 2 weeks, one cycle is 4 weeks duration) and C (pralatrexate [10 mg/m
2] followed 1 hour later by [CONTACT_35421] [300 mg/m2- starting 
dose], administered once every 2 weeks, one cycle is 4 weeks duration) of the phase 1 component.
The phase 2 expansions at the MTD will evaluate both sequential dosing (pralatrexate 10 
mg/m2 and gemcitabine 400 mg/m2) and same-day dosing (pralatrexate 15 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 600 mg/m2) in a q2 week schedule.
CLINICAL STUDIES: SOLID TUMORS (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer)Study 97-[ADDRESS_482233] Phase 1 study was conducted exclusively in patients with NSCLC, who had been previously treated with a median of 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Initially, pralatrexate was administered to 6 patients at a dose of 30 mg/m
2 IV weekly for 3 weeks 
out of 4 weeks. Due to the excessive incidence of mucositis/stomatitis/pharyngitis (mucositis) in these patients, which became the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the dosing schedule for the remaining patients was changed to a once every 2 week treatment on a 28-day cycle, starting at 15 mg/m2 q 2 weeks and escalated to a maximum dose of 170 mg/m2 q 2 weeks. Based on these Phase 1 data, the recommended dose for subsequent Phase 2 studies was 150 mg/m2 administered q 2 weeks.

Study 99-053A subsequent single-agent Phase 2 study, in patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC revealed activity of pralatrexate consistent with the activity of other single agents in this setting. Of 38 evaluable patients, 4 patients (11%) experienced a confirmed partial response (PR) lasting 4, 9, 12, and 15 months respectively, while 12 patients (31%) exhibited stabilization of their disease (SD).

SAFETY OVERVIEWThe most common adverse events observed in patients with peripheral t-cell lymphoma 
(PTCL) treated with pralatrexate were mucositis, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and fatigue. Patients receiving pralatrexate should be monitored closely because AEs may occur at any time during therapy. For detailed information about the safety profile of pralatrexate, refer to the current pralatrexate IB. Clinical Trials Experience
The safety of pralatrexate was evaluated in 111 PTCL patients in a single-arm clinical study (PDX-008) in which patients received 30 mg/m
2 once weekly for 6 weeks in 7-
week cycles.  The median duration of treatment was 70 days (range 1-540 days).

Relative Molecular Weight: 397.3Physical Properties: Slightly soluble in water
Very slightly soluble in methanolPractically insoluble in ethanol and acetone
Structural Formula:
Oxaliplatin is a diaminocyclohexane (DACH) - platinum compound, active in several solid tumor types, including some cisplatin/carboplatin refractory diseases, and licensed in the U.S. for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The main mechanism of action of oxaliplatin, like cisplatin, is mediated through the formation of DNA-adducts, but DACH-platinum adducts are bulkier and more hydrophobic than cisplatin adducts.  Oxaliplatin as a single agent has a broad spectrum of in vitro  cytotoxic/antiproliferative 
activity against a variety of murine and human tumor cell lines.  Oxaliplatin was also effective in cell lines with acquired cisplatin resistance.  
Neurotoxicity is considered the dose-limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin. The most common 
acute side effect is a transient peripheral neurotoxicity characterized by [CONTACT_385465], feet and the peri-oral area, triggered and/or enhanced by [CONTACT_385466]. Some patients report laryngo-pharyngeal dysesthesia when swallowing cold food or beverages. The intensity of symptoms is generally mild to moderate. These symptoms are often observed during an oxaliplatin infusion, may last for a few minutes to a few days, and are fully reversible. This acute toxicity, which may be observed at doses as low as (or, occasionally, lower than) 90 mg/m², increases in incidence at higher doses, to affect 75% of patients treated at 200 mg/m².  Chronic neurotoxicity, by [CONTACT_22242], is a function of cumulative oxaliplatin dose, APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

Page 21 of 65with a median time of evolution to grade 3 of 23 weeks, but a high rate of reversibility 
once oxaliplatin therapy is discontinued. Women seem more likely than men to experience severe neurotoxicity. These symptoms disappear within 12 weeks of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_385432] 50% of patients and in the majority after 30 weeks.
At doses higher than 45 mg/m², oxaliplatin induces nausea and vomiting with rapid onset 
in the great majority of patients. This can last for [ADDRESS_482239] anti-emetic measures used for all platinum derivatives. Diarrhea may occur in up to 25% of cycles; when administered with 5-FU/LV, grade 3/4 diarrhea has been reported in 12% of patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal carcinoma. Hematological toxicity is minor and sporadic. In monotherapy studies, 2% of patients experienced grade 3-4 anemia and neutropenia; grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia may also be seen in a small percentage of patients. No significant renal toxicity and <1% ototoxicity were reported with oxaliplatin. A single agent, pharmacokinetic study of oxaliplatin in patients with renal impairment was performed, and demonstrated that single agent oxaliplatin was well tolerated, even in patients with a creatinine clearances as low as 20 mg/mL/min. Allergic reactions to Oxaliplatin may occur in up to 11% of patients, but few are severe (<0.5% anaphylactic), while fever without infection may occur in up to a third of the patients.
Mechanism of Action  
Like cisplatin, oxaliplatin reacts with DNA, forming mainly platinated intrastrand links with two adjacent guanines or a guanine adjacent to an adenine.  However, DACH-platinum adducts formed by [CONTACT_385467]-diammine-platinum adducts formed from cisplatin and carboplatin (21).  The two mechanisms that reproducibly discriminate between cisplatin and oxaliplatin are defects in mismatch repair and enhanced replicative by[CONTACT_6476] (22).  Several studies have demonstrated that the loss of the mismatch repair (MMR) enzyme complex is a contributor to intrinsic resistance to cisplatin, but not oxaliplatin (23).  This resistance can be overcome by a platinum agent with a bulky carrier group, such as oxaliplatin, which can make by[CONTACT_385468].
Oxaliplatin in Colorectal Cancer
The efficacy of oxaliplatin monotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer was evaluated in five phase II trials, two with [ADDRESS_482240]-line therapy averaged 18% while that of oxaliplatin as second-line therapy averaged 10%.  These overall response rates compare favorably with those of cisplatin (3%) and carboplatin (2.4%) resulting from single-agent therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  In addition, these results were achieved with only moderate toxicity. The efficacy of oxaliplatin combined with 5-FU/LV has been evaluated in 614 previously untreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer:  136 patients in two-phase II trials and 478 patients in three phase III trials.  Response rates varied from 29% to 67%.  Median progression-free survival and overall survival ranged from 7.7 to 11 months and 12+ to APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

Page 22 of 6519 months, respectively.  Major toxicities were diarrhea, stomatitis, peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, nausea and vomiting using oxaliplatin/5-FU/LV combination therapy.[ADDRESS_482241] arm.
48, 49  In summary, clinical trials of oxaliplatin combined 
with 5-FU/LV in both chemotherapy-treated and -untreated patients with colorectal cancer have shown the effectiveness and tolerability of the oxaliplatin/5-FU/LV combination.  Oxaliplatin is approved in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and for the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer following complete resection of the primary tumor.
Oxaliplatin in cancer of the esophagus and stomach:Oxaliplatin combinations are active in the treatment of several gastrointestinal cancers 
apart from colorectal cancer, including esophageal, gastric, biliary and pancreatic tumors.  A variety of regimens have been studied in advanced EGC in phase II trials (in combination with 5-FU, capecitabine, irinotecan, docetaxel), with response rates ranging from 40-60%.
8-13, 50  An overview of the treatment options in these diseases is provided in 
reference #4.  The efficacy of oxaliplatin in advanced EGC has been confirmed in two phase III trials.
7, 51  In the REAL-2 trial, therapy-naïve patients were randomized to one 
of four combination treatment arms, aiming to examine the efficacy of oxaliplatin (as compared to cisplatin) and capecitabine (as compared to 5-FU).  There was no significant difference in response rates or progression-free survival between the arms.  Survival in the two oxaliplatin-containing arms was comparable to the cisplatin-containing arms, with less neutropenia, alopecia, thromboembolism and renal insufficiency, but greater neuropathy and diarrhea.  Overall survival for the epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], oxaliplatin and capecitabine (EOX) arm was 11.2 months (significantly longer compared to the standard ECF arm, 9.9 months) on secondary analysis.
7 Similar results of were found in the AIO study 
comparing oxaliplatin with cisplatin, when combined with leucovorin-modulated 5-FU.51  
Oxaliplatin is listed in the NCCN Drugs and Biologic CompendiumTM for the treatment 
of advanced esophageal or gastric cancer and in the pre-operative or definitive treatment of localized disease (with or without radiotherapy).

iv. After dilution with 250-500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, the shelf life is 
6 hours at room temperature [20-25°C (68-77°F)] or up to 24 hours under refrigeration [2-8°C (36-46°F)].
v. After final dilution, protection from light is not required.
Incompatibilities:
Oxaliplatin is incompatible in solution with alkaline medications or media (such as basic 
solutions of 5-FU) and must not be mixed with these or administered simultaneously through the same infusion line. The infusion line should be flushed with D5W prior to administration of any concomitant medication.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration and discarded if present.
Needles or intravenous administration sets containing aluminum parts that may come in 
contact [CONTACT_385469]. Aluminum has been reported to cause degradation of platinum compounds.
Handling and Disposal:As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling 
and preparation of infusion solutions prepared from oxaliplatin. The use of gloves is recommended. If a solution of oxaliplatin contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If oxaliplatin contacts the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water.
Institutional procedures for the handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be 
considered.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

8.1 Premedication
Folic acid (1-1.25 mg/d) will be given orally daily starting at least [ADDRESS_482247] dose of pralatrexate.Please see appendix 1: Diary for folic acid medication   
Vitamin B 12 (1000 mcg) will be administered intra-muscularly no more than [ADDRESS_482248] dose of pralatrexate and repeated every 8-10 weeks thereafter while on treatment with pralatrexate.  Subsequent B
12 injections may be 
given the same day as pralatrexate.  
8.2 Chemotherapy
Following appropriate anti-emetic therapy (to include a 5-HT [ADDRESS_482249] and a 
steroid), pralatrexate will be administered intravenously in a dose of 120 mg/m2 
over 3-5 minutes followed by [CONTACT_385454] 85 mg/m2 intravenously over 2 hours.  
Cycles will be repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression, undue toxicity, or patient/physician discretion.  For patients meeting response criteria to continue therapy, oxaliplatin will be discontinued after 12 cycles (maximum cumulative dose = 1020 mg/m

investigator following discussions with the biostatistician, NCCN and Allos Therapeutics, Inc. 
General Guidelines for Chemotherapy Use:
•The dose of chemotherapy may be rounded off (up or down) to the nearest 
whole number or for purposes of minimizing wastage from a drug vial so long as the dose is within 5% of the actual calculated dose.
•It is not necessary to change the dose of chemotherapy administered in 
successive cycles unless the calculated dose changes by > 10%.
•There is no clearly documented adverse impact of treatment of obese 
patients when dosing is performed according to actual body weight.  Therefore all calculations will be based solely on the patients’ actual body weight for the purpose of determining the body surface area.  This will help minimize calculation errors and possible introduction of variation in dose administration.  Failure to adhere to this will be considered a major protocol violation.
•Patients should be counseled to avoid ice-chips, cold drinks, and exposure 
to cold water or air as the neurotoxicity seen with oxaliplatin is often exacerbated by [CONTACT_385470].  The duration of this cold-related neuropathy is not well defined and patients should exercise caution regarding cold exposure during the treatment cycle.
8.3 Duration of Therapy
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applies:
•Disease progression,
•Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
•Unacceptable adverse events(s),
•Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or
•General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

blood products, antibiotics and anti-emetics where deemed medically appropriate.  The use of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_385433].
9.2. Growth Factor Use
The use of erythropoietin (EPO) and darbepoetin is permitted at the discretion of 
the treating physician.
The use of filgastrim (G-CSF), pegfilgastrim and sargramostin (GM-CSF) is 
discouraged.  They may not be used:
•To avoid dose delays or reductions
•Prophylactically for concern of myelosuppression
•For the routine treatment of febrile neutropenia (except in the following 
circumstances)
However the use of CSFs is permitted per ASCO guidelines, e.g., patients with 
indicators of poor prognosis such as pneumonia, hypotension, multi-organ dysfunction and invasive fungal infection.  In these cases, treating physician discretion will prevail.  The reason and duration for CSF use should be recorded.

11. Safety Lead-In Cohort
This initial portion of the study will be limited to the first 6 patients at cohort 1 for 
purpose of toxicity evaluation of the combination of pralatrexate and oxaliplatin.  This dose level will be considered tolerable following completion of two cycles (28 days) of treatment in 5 out of 6 patients in the absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT).  If > [ADDRESS_482255]: 5/5/2017

Date:  09.01.15
Page 29 of 65cohort -1.  Cohort -1 will be considered tolerable if < 1 patient experiences a DLT.  If so, 
the remainder patients will be accrued at this level.  If this criterion is not met (i.e. > 2 
DLTs observed), then further examination of a lower dose (cohort -2) will be explored at 
the discretion of the investigator following discussions with the biostatistician, NCCN and Allos Therapeutics, Inc.
Dose-limiting toxicity  in this safety lead-in cohort will be defined as any of the 
following conditions related to study treatment occurring within the first 28 days of treatment (2 cycles):1. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days2. Febrile neutropenia, defined as grade 3 or 4 neutropenia associated with a fever of   
> 100.4 F ( = 38.0 C)
3. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia4. Any > grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity with the following exceptions:
a. Grade 3 diarrhea, nausea or vomiting in the absence of optimal anti-diarrheal or anti-emetic treatment, provided toxicity resolves within 7 days and no dose reduction is required.b. Grade 3 hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, or hypophosphatemia which responds to medical intervention, provided toxicity resolves within 7 days and no dose reductions are required. 
5. Treatment delay of > 14 days for toxicity
Hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin will not constitute a DLT – if this adversity 
necessitates discontinuation of the drug within the first [ADDRESS_482256] elapsed following the initiation of therapy for the sixth patient to enable complete evaluation.  Patients enrolled in the safety lead-in part will count towards full accrual, including primary and secondary objectives.  If a patient in this cohort does not complete 28 days of therapy, he/she will be replaced provided the discontinuation was not secondary to toxicity.  The data on the first six evaluable patients and interpretation thereof will be communicated to the biostatistician, RPCI Phase I committee and the IRB before continuation of enrollment commences.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

Page 30 of 6512. Dose Delays and Dose Modifications
A new cycle of treatment may not begin until the ANC is > 1500/mm3 and the platelet 
count is > 100,000/mm3, and any treatment-related non-hematologic toxicity (except 
sensory neuropathy – see below) has resolved to < grade 1.  In this case, weekly 
evaluations (clinical and laboratory) will be required to assess for resumption of therapy.  
Prior to any pralatrexate dose, mucositis must be < grade 1.  Assessment and grading of 
toxicity will be per NCI CTCAE Version 4.0.
Dose modifications and/or delays will be based on laboratory parameters obtained on day 
1 of a given cycle, or based on nadir counts, if obtained (or worst non-hematologic toxicity) during that cycle.  Blood counts obtained within 1 day prior may also be used to determine continuation/modification of dosing.  As an example – a patient enrolled who lives some distance away from RPCI may have counts done closer to home on the day prior to determine eligibility for treatment on a given day.
In the event of adverse events, dose modifications should apply as per this section with 
the following guidelines: 
• For toxicities, which are considered by [CONTACT_385471], or life–threatening events (e.g. alopecia, altered taste etc.), treatment will be continued at the same dose without reduction or interruption. In addition, no dose reductions or interruptions will be required for anemia as it can be satisfactorily managed by [CONTACT_27752].  
• For any event, which is apparent at baseline, the dose modifications will apply 
according to the corresponding shift in toxicity grade, if the investigator feels it is appropriate.  (e.g. if a patient has grade 1 asthenia at baseline which increases to grade 2 during treatment, this will be considered as a shift of 1 grade and treated as a grade 1 toxicity for dose modification purposes).
• If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], a noted toxicity is considered solely due to 
one drug, then the dose of the other drug need not be modified.
If the dose is modified to manage an adverse event, it is recommended that the patient be 
seen by [CONTACT_385472]-starting study drug.  Once a dose has been reduced it 
will not be increased at a later time.   If toxicity or other reason requires a dosing 
delay/interruption of both drugs of more than four weeks, the patient will be withdrawn from protocol therapy and the reason recorded.

without any objective  evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (laryngospasm, bronchospasm or 
hypoxia) has also been observed.  This neurotoxicity may be induced or exacerbated upon exposure to cold and should be distinguished from a hypersensitivity reaction.  If a patient develops LPD, the patient’s oxygen saturation should be evaluated via a pulse oximeter and, if normal, reassurance, a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_385436].  The oxaliplatin infusion may then be continued at a reduced rate, 33% of the original rate.  Because this syndrome may be associated with the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_79866], subsequent doses of oxaliplatin should be administered as 6-hour infusions.  To minimize the risk of LPD, patients will be instructed to avoid ice and cold drinks the day of treatment. 
Hypersensitivity reactions:Oxaliplatin, as is the case with all platinum-containing compounds, is associated with a 
measurable (approximately 11%) incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, usually after multiple doses of treatment. This may present as bronchospasm, hypotension, and even hemolytic anemia.  Pretreatment with glucocorticoids and antihistamines may be useful for some patients, but may not always prevent the development of anaphylactoid reactions, especially in patients with a prior history of hypersensitivity to this agent.  For patients who have experienced a Grade 1 or 2 acute hypersensitivity reaction that is assessed as related to oxaliplatin administration, the following premedication is recommended prior to each subsequent dose of oxaliplatin (patients who have grade 3 or 4 acute hypersensitivity reactions should discontinue oxaliplatin therapy):  
Dexamethasone 20 mg PO or IV, 12 and 6 hours prior to the oxaliplatin dose;
OR
Dexamethasone 20 mg PO or IV, as well as diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and one of the 
following: cimetidine 300 mg IV, ranitidine 50 mg IV, or famotidine 20 mg IV 30-60 
minutes prior to oxaliplatin administration. If these prophylactic measures fail to prevent 
oxaliplatin-related hypersensitivity, therapy with oxaliplatin should be discontinued.  In this case, pralatrexate alone will be continued.
Pulmonary Fibrosis:
In the case of unexplained respi[INVESTIGATOR_385437], dyspnea 
or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, oxaliplatin should be discontinued until further investigation excludes interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.  If interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is confirmed, oxaliplatin therapy should be terminated.

Upon monitoring weekly hematologic and renal parameters, if new onset of renal failure

Laboratory parameters that may be be used to determine whether hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is present include: CBC, differential, platelets, PT, PTT, fibrinogen, FDP, ATIII, VWF, ANA, RhF, C3, C4, CH50, antiplatelet antibodies, platelet-associated IgG, and ciruculating immune complexes.  If oxaliplatin is determined to be the cause of renal failure, hemolytic anemia or HUS, the drug will be permanently discontinued.
13. Endpoints
Primary:  The primary end-point of this phase II trial is the overall response rate (ORR) 
to combination pralatrexate and oxaliplatin in advanced EGC.  This will be determined 
using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.[ADDRESS_482263] documentation of response.Secondary: The toxicity of this regimen will be recorded for all patients who received at 
least one dose of therapy.  Other end-points will include calculation of time-to-progression and overall survival.  Definitions of these variables are in the statistical section.Correlative:  The pharmacogenomic and tissue micro-RNA profiling end-points of this 
trial are outlined in the respective correlative science section.
14. Statistical Analysis
The study is a two-stage, single arm, unblinded Phase II trial allowing for early 
termination in case of futility.  In the standard of care therapy, overall response rates (complete response + partial response) for advanced esophago-gastric cancer are around 0.20.  An exact two-stage design proposed by [CONTACT_385478]-most equal to the standard of care, against an alternative that it is greater.
54  The following study design has 
80% power to detect a 0.40 overall response rate with the study treatment, while controlling to 5% the probability of erroneously finding a truly ineffective treatment as worthy of further research.
Seventeen eligible patients will be enrolled in the first stage of the trial.  If a maximum of

Page 37 of 65Time to tumor progression (TTP) will be measured from the date of study enrollment to 
the first observation of progressive disease.  Overall survival (OS) will be measured from the date of study enrollment to the time of death from any cause.  These variables will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Statistics describing the time to event distributions will be obtained from Kaplan-Meier methods and Proportional Hazards models.  Continuous variables will be summarized with commonly used statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, etc.), with sub-group associations tested using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.  Categorical variables will be summarized in contingency tables, with associations of interest assessed using Fisher’s Exact Test.  Given the exploratory nature of this study, all p-values less than 0.05 will be deemed statistically significant.  No adjustment will be made to the significance threshold to control for the effects of multiple testing on the overall Type I error rate.
The analyses for the correlative science studies are outlined in the correlative study 
section.
15. Correlative Studies
15.1 Background:
Pralatrexate like pemetrexed is a novel antifolate with activity in non small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), Hodgkin’s disease, mesothelioma and bladder cancer. Pralatrexate is an analog of methotrexate and acts as a potent dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor. Studies indicate that pralatrexate selectively enters cells expressing reduced folate carrier (RFC-1) which is encoded by [CONTACT_103095]19A1 ; and its increased retention in cells results from 
its high affinity for folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS). Like pemetrexed, the steady state accumulation of pralatrexate polyglutamates will depend primarily on activation/inactivation processes by [CONTACT_385479].
55-57  In previous studies 
with pemetrexed in NSCLC we identified correlations between haplotype-tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms (ht-SNPs) in SLC19A1 , the gamma glutamyl hydrolase 
gene, GGH , and FPGS  and efficacy as well as toxicity.  In this proposal, we hypothesize 
that functionally relevant polymorphisms in these [ADDRESS_482265] such as MTHFR and TYMS and DHFR either singly or in combination, play a role in the efficacy and/or toxicity of pralatrexate (Correlative Section Specific Aim 1).
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that were first described in the 
nematode C. elegans  more than a decade ago
58, and are now known to regulate the 
expression of protein coding genes in various organisms. Over [ADDRESS_482266]: 5/5/2017
I 169210
Date:  09.01.15
Page 38 of 65
number of miRNA known at this time is smaller, making miRNA profiles more robustly 
analyzable statistically than mRNA profiles. Therefore a microRNA signature [CONTACT_385500]. Limited data exists for the utilization of microRNA signatures for chemosensitivity prediction. As shown in the figure below, cell lines with increasing resistance (increasing IG50) show different microRNA profiles. This difference may be utilized in chemosensitivity prediction.  In 
the Correlative Section Specific Aim 2, we hypothesize that response to pralatrexate can be predicted by [CONTACT_385456][INVESTIGATOR_385422].
 
15.2 Preliminary Data:   
We have resequenced FPGS  and obtained polymorphism (SNP) information.
60  We also 
utilized data from NCBI and HapMap databases to obtain polymorphism information on GGH  and SLC19A1 .  We identified SNPs in these three candidate genes, SLC19A1  and 
GGH and FPGS , and genotyped for the SNPs in two studies with pemetrexed–treated 
patients.
61-63  In these small studies,SNPs in SLC19A1, FPGS  and GGH correlated with 
efficacy and toxicity of pemetrexed. In the pemetrexed-gemcitabine study, patients heterozygous for polymorphisms in FPGS  and GGH had more grades 3/4 adverse events 
including SGPT (ALT) elevation, dyspnea and fatique, although not statistically significant. Similarly, polymorphisms in GGH  associated with confirmed response.
62  As 
well, three SNPs in SLC19A1 predicted for  statistically significant differences in overall 
survival in the study:  IVS4(2117)T>C; IVS5(9148) A>C and Exon6(2522) C>T, p=0.03.  
A similar analysis in our recently completed phase II study (50 patients) of pemetrexed in combination with bevacizumab in second-line NSCLC also identified SNPs in FPGS, 
GGH  and SLC19A1 which correlated with toxicity and efficacy.

Specific Aim 1:  Genotype DNA samples from patients enrolled in the clinical trial 
for tagged SNPs in candidate genes responsible for the activation, inactivation and 
transport of pralatrexate . The genes are FPGS , GGH  and SLC19A1 .  We propose to 
evaluate the possible contribution of pharmacogenetics (PG) to variable molecular responses and toxicity of pralatrexate by [CONTACT_385480] , GGH  and SLC19A1 . The tagged SNPs will be correlated APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

15.3.2 Sample Collection and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  Five (5) ml of blood will be collected into an 
EDTA tube at baseline or at any time during the study (since therapy does not affect gene polymorphisms). Genomic DNA will be extracted and stored till analysis as previously described.

dichotomous genomic events (i.e., homozygote/heterozygote, or presense/absense of polymorphisms, etc.) with adverse avents. If [ADDRESS_482269]. Type I error control will be performed, by [CONTACT_385482] 5 false positives to 5%. Correlations of the haplotype-tagged SNPs with response, OS, and TTP will be explored  by [CONTACT_385483],  to explore the impact of these germline SNPs on binary and time to event outcomes. These exploratory comparisons will be carried out on the entire cohort, as well as within different patient subgroups such as responders, and progression-free and stable patients if feasible.  
15.3.4 Sample Size:  A limitation of the present study is the small sample size (34 patients), 
which lacks the power to make robust associations between SNPs and treatment outcome (toxicity and efficacy). We see these correlative studies as hypothesis-generating. SNPs identified in this study as potentially predictive of efficacy or toxicity will be tested in future studies.  If as many as 5 subjects are observed as homozygous, the design provides for 75% power to detect a true adverse event rate of 37%.  If 6 subjects are observed as homozygous, there will be 75% power to detect an OR of 16.5, and for 10 observed homozygotes, an OR of 9.44.
15.4 Study Design and Methods (MicroRNA profiling)
Specific Aim 2:  MicroRNA expression profiles generated using cell line data can 
predict response to pralatrexate chemotherapy using expression profiling of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_385423]-capture microdissection (LCM).  For these experiments, it is crucial that we use only the epi[INVESTIGATOR_385438]. There is data that strongly suggests that the gene expression of whole tumors is different from that of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_385439]
70.  This 
is especially important when the gene expression measurements are those of miRNA because the changes seen in miRNA expression classifiers typi[INVESTIGATOR_385440]. Network Sites please see Appendix [ADDRESS_482270]: 5/5/2017

Page 41 of 6515.4.1 Experimental plan:  Existing chemosensitivity data of the NCI-60 cell line panel to 
pemetrexed will be used to generate a miRNA signature. The feasibility of using this has been demonstrated using publicly available chemosensitivity data (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/index.html) along with publicly accessible NCI-60 miRNA microarray data
71 in the figure above. Such an analysis will be performed using data from 
an updated miRNA microarray platform (Affymetrix Inc.) using RNA from the NCI-[ADDRESS_482271] successfully profiled RNA from both the epi[INVESTIGATOR_385441] (FFPE) lung cancer tissue. Therefore the methods required to perform the experiment have been standardized. Once the pemetrexed sensitivity signature [CONTACT_385501], the RNA obtained from the LCM-derived epi[INVESTIGATOR_385442]-gastric tumor tissue (FFPE) will be used to generate epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]-specific miRNA profiles of the pre-treatment biopsy specimens using the Affymetrix microRNA microarray platform.  The primary tumor tissue will be obtained by [CONTACT_9256] (those with primary in place) or from the original FFPE block (for those patients who underwent prior resection, or definitive therapy without local relapse).  Non-availability of primary site tumor tissue will not preclude enrollment on this study towards the primary end-point of efficacy.  These patients will be excluded from the micro-RNA correlative study analysis.
  The specimens will then be classified into “sensitive” and “specific” categories. 
This classification will then be compared to the clinical responsiveness of the tumor as judged by [CONTACT_351668]. We use pemetrexed sensitivity data in this proposal because pralatrexate chemosensitivty data of the NCI-60 cell line panel is not available and because of the close approximation of the mechanism of action of both drugs.

rank sum test.  We will have 70% power to detect a [ADDRESS_482272] deviation difference in means, assuming 10 responders and 23 non-responders, bounding the probability of more than 10 false positives to 5%.  We will visually explore the distributions of candidate mir signature [CONTACT_385502], by [CONTACT_305846], for artifacts, outliers, symmetry and spread.  Data transformations,and discretizations will be evaluated for supervised and partially unsupervised prediction performance. We will investigate signature [CONTACT_385503], such as Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Fisher's Discriminant with nested class Partitioning Around Mediods, considering univariate and multivariate variable selection methods.  We will evaluate the prediction performance with ROC and Threshold/Recall Analysis conducted under k-fold monte carlo cross validation.  Significant differences in sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve will be inferred with bootstrap techniques.  Further exploration will include measuring the marginal predictive utility of the miRNA signatures, accounting for known and potential risk factors.
16. Adverse Event Reporting
IDENTIFICATION, RECORDING AND HANDLING ADVERSE EVENTSAdverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  An 
adverse event is any adverse change (developi[INVESTIGATOR_255931]) from the patient’s baseline (pre-treatment) condition, including intercurrent illness, which occurs during the course of a clinical study after treatment has started, whether considered related to treatment or not. All adverse events encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the case report form (CRF).The intensity of clinical adverse events will be graded according to the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, which have recommended grading. 
Adverse events not listed on the CTC grading system will be graded according to the 
following scale:
Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activityModerate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activitySevere: Incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activityLife–threatening: Self–explanatoryAPPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

Date:  09.01.[ADDRESS_482273] changed; but does not include pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385443]-existing conditions.  In addition, the investigator should notify National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network (NCCN)  of any SAE or outcome that may occur after this time period 
that he/she believes to be related to pralatrexate and oxaliplatin .  All SAEs or AEs 
related to study drugs  must be followed to resolution, stabilization or return to baseline, 
or deemed irreversible.  An AE report must contain the following four basic elements:  (1) an identifiable patient; (2) a suspect medicinal product; (3) an identifiable reporting source; and (4) an identifiable event or outcome. All identified AEs must be recorded and described on the appropriate page of the CRF.  If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded in addition to the presenting symptoms.  The following information should be captured for all AEs:  the date of the onset and resolution; the severity of the event (see definitions in National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE] Version 4.0); the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_385444] (certainly/definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, or not related); the treatment required for the AE; information regarding resolution/outcome; and if the AE is serious, a clear identification of the seriousness outcome.   In addition, all Roswell Park Cancer Institute initiated trials will be monitored periodically by [CONTACT_385485].
Definitions An Adverse Event  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment.   
Serious Adverse Events (SAE)
A serious adverse event as defined by [CONTACT_385486]:
•results in death
•is life-threatening (The patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not  
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)
•requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Note: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations; for example, important medical events may APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385445]:
•reasons described in the protocol, e.g., drug administration, protocol-required testing
•social reason in the absence of an AE
•surgery or procedure planned prior to entry into the trial
Nonserious Adverse Events
Any adverse event that is not an SAE is, by [CONTACT_15094], a non-serious AE.
An Unexpected Adverse Event  is an event that is not listed in the current Clinical 
Investigator’s Brochure (CIB) / Package Insert or an event that may be mentioned in the CIB / Package Insert, but differs from the event because of greater severity or specificity.
For SAEs occurring in the current study, the Expectedness of an Adverse Event  will 
be determined by [CONTACT_385487], provided in the latest version of the CIB.  If the term is not contained in the list under the relevant body system, the term is to be considered UNEXPECTED. 
For comparative drugs, expectedness is determined by [CONTACT_385488]: 
the US Package Insert (if marketed drug) or Clinical Investigator Brochure (if Investigational New Drug).
Causality  is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
may have caused or contributed to an adverse event. It includes assessing temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) with underlying diseases, and the presence (or absence) or a lack of one or more likely causes. The Investigator must determine if an adverse event is in some way related to the use of the study drug.  This relationship should be described as follows: 
Unlikely or Unrelated:  The event is clearly due to causes distinct from the use of the 
study drug, such as a documented pre-existing condition, the effect of a concomitant 
medication, a new condition which, based on the pathophysiology of the condition, and the pharmacology of the study drug, would be unlikely related to the use of the study drug.
Possible: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study drug or the event follows a known response pattern to the study drug BUT the event 
could have been produced by [CONTACT_241803], based on the pathophysiology of the condition, and the pharmacology of the study drug, would be APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

Probable: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study drug and the event follows a known response pattern to the study drug AND the 
event cannot have been reasonably explained by [CONTACT_385489] a concomitant medication
Definite: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study drug, the event follows a known response pattern to the study drug and based on 
the known pharmacology of the study drug, the event is clearly related to the effect of the study drug
Unknown: Based on the evidence available, causality cannot be ascribed

Additional Requirements for IND HOLDERS  -----------------------------------------------------------
Expedited IND Safety Reports:
Adverse events meeting certain criteria will require expedited reports to the FDA, IRB, 
and Allos Therapeutics. A case report must be one that is serious AND unexpected AND drug-related (to any degree) to be subject to regulations for expedited safety reports.  
Any adverse event that meets criteria as an SAE (see section entitled "Types of Adverse 
Events") is SERIOUS.
Any adverse event not already described in the study Investigator Brochure is 
UNEXPECTED.  If no formal Investigator Brochure exists, then the current, FDA-approved product label (package insert) will be used to determine expectedness of an event.

If pregnancy is confirmed the patient must not receive study medications and must be withdrawn from the study.
Throughout the entire pregnancy, additional contact [CONTACT_385490], and 
in some cases with the healthcare provider, to identify spontaneous abortions and elective terminations, as well as any medical reasons for elective termination. In addition, the study investigator should include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_482277] abstraction, or a combination of these methods. All serious adverse event reports relating to the pregnancy, including spontaneous abortion, elective abortion and congenital anomalies, should be forwarded to the FDA and the NCCN and a copy sent to Allos Therapeutics.  
17. Criteria for Response and Progression
The primary end-point of this phase II trial is the overall response rate (ORR) to 
combination pralatrexate and oxaliplatin in advanced EGC.  This will be determined 
using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.[ADDRESS_482278]: 5/5/2017
I 169210
Date:  09.01.15
Page 48 of 6517.1 Definitions :
RECIST Version 1.[ADDRESS_482279] to the following:
1. Number of lesions to be assessed decreased to a maximum of 5 (from 10) with a 
maximum of 2 per organ.
2. Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated.  Nodes that 
measure > 15mm in short axis are considered pathologic and measurable.  This should be included in the calculation of tumor response, if applicable.
3. Greater stringency to the definition of progressive disease which requires and 
increase by 20% in sum of the target lesions AND a 5mm absolute increase.
Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.  Note:  Lesions are either measurable or non-
measurable using the criteria provided below.  The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.
Measurable diseaseMeasurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least 
one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_482280] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5mm) or as >10 mm by [CONTACT_385491] > 20mm by [CONTACT_13190] X-ray.  In addition, pathologic lymph nodes measuring > 15mm in 
short axis are also considered measurable.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).
Non-measurable disease
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <[ADDRESS_482281] scan; LNs > 10mm to < 15mm), are considered non-measurable 
disease.  Blastic bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (identified by [CONTACT_385492]) are all non-measurable.  For lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic plus blastic bone lesions that have an identifiable soft tissue component reproducibly measurable by [CONTACT_48928], definitions of measurability above will apply.  For cystic lesions thought to represent malignant disease, similar criteria will apply, though it is preferable to use non-cystic lesions, if present, for the purpose of assessment and response.   
Target lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017
I 169210
Date:  09.01.15
Page 49 of 65measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]).  A sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218].
Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Non-target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the maximum numbers per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non-measurable lesions.  Measurements of these lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable DiseaseAll measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might 
not be considered measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include 
them, the conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol . 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_30574] a treatment.
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. Chest x-ray.  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable. 
Conventional CT and MRI.   These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_482282], abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols.
Ultrasound (US).   When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response 
evaluation, US should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

Date:  09.01.[ADDRESS_482283] normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
Cytology, Histology.   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease can be considered to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.
Response Criteria
Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR):       Disappearance of all target lesions; any pathological 
lymph node (whether target or not) must have reduction in short axis to < 10mm
Partial Response (PR):        At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  In addition, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment startedAPPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

normalization of tumor marker level
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non-
target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, in such 
circumstances the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13387], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463].Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.
Evaluation of best overall responseThe best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Page 52 of 65Notes:
•Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective progression, even after discontinuation of treatment.
•In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status.
Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response
ConfirmationThis is required in the current trial as the primary end-point is response rate.  To be

Duration of overall responseThe duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met 
for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).

18.1 This study will not be initiated until the protocol and informed consent document(s) have 
been reviewed and approved by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC). Each patient (or legal guardian) shall read, understand, and sign an instrument of informed consent prior to performance of any study-specific procedure. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the patient is made aware of the investigational nature of the treatment and that informed consent is given.
The Investigator is responsible for the retention of the patient log and patient records; 
although personal information may be reviewed by [CONTACT_92718], that information will be treated as strictly confidential and will not be made publicly available. The investigator is also responsible for obtaining patient authorization to access medical records and other applicable study specific information according to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations (where applicable).
This study will be conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations of 
the state and/or country and institution where the patient is treated, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, and according to the guidelines in this protocol, including attached appendices.
18.2 Informed Consent
The Investigator is responsible for obtaining written consent from each patient or the 
patient's legally authorized representative in accordance with ICH-GCP guidelines using the approved informed consent form, before any study specific procedures (including screening procedures) are performed. The informed consent form acknowledges all information that must be given to the patient according to ICH-GCP, including the purpose and nature of the study, the expected efficacy and possible side effects of the treatment(s), and specifying that refusal to participate will not influence further options for therapy. Any additional information that is applicable to the study must also be included. Additional national or institutionally mandated requirements for informed consent must also be adhered to. The patient should also be made aware that by [CONTACT_17317], processing of sensitive clinical trial data and transfer to other countries for further processing is allowed.
The Investigator shall provide a copy of the information sheet and of the signed consent 
form to the patient and the signed original shall be maintained in the Investigator File. A copy of the signed consent form must be filed in the patient file. At any stage, the patient may withdraw from the study and such a decision will not affect any further treatment options.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

19.1 Data Collection
Data entry into the database is to be completed in a timely fashion (approximately within 
28 days) after the patient’s clinic visit. If an adverse event is considered serious it is captured on both the Adverse Event page and the Serious Adverse Event Form, which is handled in an expedited fashion (see Section 16)
Data management activities will be performed using eRT.  eRT is a suite of software 
tools that enables the collection, cleaning and viewing of clinical trial data. CRS data management will design the study-specific database and facilitate it’s development by [CONTACT_385494].  Once the database design is approved by [CONTACT_978], Statistician, and Clinical Research Coordinator, the database will be put into production and data entry can begin.  Data can be entered and changed only by [CONTACT_356709] (electronic CRFs). 
eRT is compliant with all relevant technical aspects of relevant GCP guidelines. 
• The system can generate accurate copi[INVESTIGATOR_385446] 
• System access is limited to authorized individuals through the controlled 
assignment of unique ID and password combinations
• The system is designed to periodically force users to change their passwords and 
verifies that user ID and password combinations remain unique. 
• The system automatically generates a permanent time-stamped audit trail of all 
user interactions.
When data entry is complete, data management will review the data and will query any 
missing, incomplete, or invalid data points for resolution by [CONTACT_385495].  Once all queries have been resolved, the data can be released to the statistician for analysis. 
20. Maintenance of Study Documents
Essential documents should be retained per RPCI policy for 6 years from the study 
termination date. These documents could be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_248310]. It is the responsibility of RPCI to inform the investigator/ institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If, for any reason, the Investigator desires to no longer maintain the study records, they may be transferred to another institution, another investigator, or to RPCI upon written agreement between the Investigator and RPCI.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 5/5/2017

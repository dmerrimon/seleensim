Version 3, 11/14/[ADDRESS_778618] SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_590630] -operative pain control in patients undergoing 
laparotomy. It has been associated with better pain control than patient -controlled analgesia 
with intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_590631]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_590632], when a combination 
of a local anesthetic and an opi[INVESTIGATOR_590633]. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_590634], with a continuous dose of medication infused, and patient -controlled bolus 
dosing available. Once bowel function has returned, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_590635] a regimen of oral pain medications.  
 
Recently, the concept of enhanced recovery, in lieu of patient -controlled analgesia, has been 
validated in the colorectal and gynecologic surgical literature. Enhanced recovery pathways 
include pre- operative education, elimination of mechanical bowel prep, limited drain 
placement, early ambulation, and structured use of intra- operative and post -operative anti -
emetics and analgesics. The use of intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_590636].  
 
The role of epi[INVESTIGATOR_590637]. We 
will randomize participants undergoing laparotomy for gynecologic indications to epi[INVESTIGATOR_590638]. no epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892]. All patients will participate in an enhanced recovery 
pathway as described below. We will compare pain scores, opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
post-operative antiemetic use, return of bowel function, patient satisfaction, post -operative 
complications, and readmission rates in both groups. 
 A translational correlate to our clinical endpoint will be examination of stress and inflammation 
response in patients receiving epi[INVESTIGATOR_590639]. There is evidence that 
neuroaxial blockade can decrease cytokine release (a marker for inflammation) and decrease cortisol release (a marker for stress). This is particularly important in patients with cancer, 
where immune function has the capabilit y of affecting the tumor microenvironment.  
 
Protocol UW14030 
Version 3, 11/14/[ADDRESS_778619] -operative patients, nasogastric tube use was 
subsequently shown to increase pneumonia, atelectasis and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (1) and is now used 
only in select patients. New, evidence- based management pathways have been developed to 
attenuate the stress response associated with surgery and accelerate post -operative recovery 
(2,3). Termed ‘enhanced recovery pathways’ by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kehlet, a colorectal surgeon, aspects of 
these pathways have slowly disseminated and have been adapted across different surgical 
Protocol UW14030 
Version 3, 11/14/[ADDRESS_778620] been published demonstrating their benefits.  Key 
elements common to all enhanced recovery pathways include: preoperative patient education, reduction of preoperative fasting, omission of bowel preparation, perioperative normovolemia, 
limited u se of nasogastric tubes and drains, early removal of urinary catheters, aggressive 
multimodal analgesia to minimize opi[INVESTIGATOR_9357], early postoperative mobilization, prokinetics to enhance gastrointestinal motility, and early oral intake. Recently, Kalogera et al. 
published a retrospective cohort study demonstrating the use of an enhanced recovery pathway in a gynecologic patient population (4). Patients undergoing laparotomy for debulking, 
staging and benign procedures (including vaginal prolapse surgery) were included. The 
described enhanced recovery pathway resulted in a [ADDRESS_778621] savings (more than $500,000 in 81 patients). Patient satisfaction scores and 30- day outcomes were similar in both groups (4).  
 
Individual surgeons currently adopt elements of different enhanced recovery pathways at our 
institution, but a rigorous multi- disciplinary system has yet to be enacted.  
 
Many aspects of the enhanced recovery pathway are focused on hastening the return of 
gastrointestinal function after surgery, including minimizing opi[INVESTIGATOR_9357] (5). At our 
institution, return of bowel function after laparotomy is often the rate limiting factor impacting 
length of h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. Like many institutions, we have explored the potential benefit of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_590640]. The benefit of epi[INVESTIGATOR_590641] -
laparotomy pain management has been demonstrated in a number of randomized controlled trials and meta -analyses (6, 7 ). The [ADDRESS_778622] concluded that 
although there was improved pain control with continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_590642]. patient controlled analgesia, there was no statistical ly significan t difference  in the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590643] (8). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_590644], epi[INVESTIGATOR_590645], attributable to regional trends and physician 
preference. In our institution, we do not often utilize epi[INVESTIGATOR_590646], fearing that postoperative hypotension may lead to anastamotic ischemia and subsequent bowel leak. Many surgeons find that the frequency of epi[INVESTIGATOR_590647], and preferentially use patient- controlled analgesia (PCA), typi[INVESTIGATOR_590648]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_590649], dependent on the availability of anesthesia staff. Further, no prospective data have been 
collected regarding the use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_590650].  
 
We will test the hypothesis that patients who receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_590651]. We have identified an exploratory translational endpoint, which examines the role of epi[INVESTIGATOR_590652]. Serum markers of inflammation (IL- 2, IL-6, TNF, CRP ) will  
be compared between the two groups. Salivary cortisol levels (as a marker of stress) will also 
be obtained to make comparisons. This may be of particular interest for our subjects with a 
cancer diagnosis, as stress and inflammation have been shown to negatively affect tumor 
behavior, promoting invasion, angiogenesis and metastases.

telephone script will be used.  If the subject is interested in learning more about the 
study, the study team may mail the subject a consent form and/or invite the subject to 
come in for a research visit. Two attempts will be made to call the potential subject. If 
the subject does not answer the phone , does not return the phone calls , or is not 
interested in participating, the study team will not make additional attempts to contact

Additionally, if a patient is admitted directly to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a laparotomy or was not 
recruited at the pre- op visit, she may be recruited and consented in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This is 
relatively rare in our patient population. Recruitment and consenting would only be considered if the patient were admitted the day prior to surgery and adequate time 
were available to discuss the study and obtain consent. In the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], a member of the clinical/surgical team who is also a member of the research team (e.g., 
resident, surgeon, fellow) would approach the potential subject. Consent would then be obtained by [CONTACT_590700] (e.g., study 
coordinator).  
 
The study staff will provide the anesthesiology team with regular notifications regarding 
consented subjects and their planned surgery dates.  Subjects  will be considered

 dysfunction is common, the catheter will be removed at the physician’s 
discretion.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diet 
 If a gastric emptying device (orogastric or nasogastric tube) was used intraoperatively, it will be removed at extubation. The first meal of low 
residual diet will be ordered 4 hours after completion of surgery (or upon 
arrival to floor). Within the first [ADDRESS_778635] -operative bowel 
function.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Fluid balance 
 
Upon arrival to the floor IV fluids will be infused at 40 mL/h. A nursing 
communication will be sent to peripheral lock IV when patient has had 600 
mL orally intake or at 8:[ADDRESS_778636] -operative day (POD) #1, whichever 
comes first. Fluid boluses will be given at the discretion of the physician.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analgesia  
 
There will be a goal of no IV patient -controlled analgesia. In the epi[INVESTIGATOR_76253], dosing and rate of standardized medication will be managed by [CONTACT_590702][INVESTIGATOR_590674]. This will include the standard order set for patients who receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_590675]. 
Medications will include the epi[INVESTIGATOR_590676], oral narcotic on an as needed basis, scheduled acetaminophen, 
and as -needed anti -emetics. The dose of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_9360] (either the 
concentration or the rate) can be increased on post-operatively  based on 
blood pressures, pain scores and sensory exam. In the non -epi[INVESTIGATOR_590677] 
(and in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_590678]), suggested pain 
medication regimen guidelines are as follows:  
  
Oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_590679] 5–15 mg orally will be administered every 3 hours as needed for 
pain rated 4 or greater or greater than patient stated comfort goal (5 mg for 
pain rated 4– 5, 10 mg for pain rated 6- 7, or 15 mg for pain rated 8- 10). If 15 
mg every 3 hours is inadequate for pain control as evidenced by a need for IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_590680] 
10mg increments.   
 
Scheduled acetaminophen 
Protocol UW14030 
Version 3, 11/14/[ADDRESS_778637] s with 
no or mild hepatic disease (acetaminophen 1,000 mg orally twice daily for 
patients with moderate hepatic disease). Maximum acetaminophen should 
not exceed 3,000 mg/24 hours from all sources  
 
Scheduled NSAIDs  
Ketorolac  15 mg IV will be given every 6 h for four doses (start no sooner 
than [ADDRESS_778638] intraoperative dose). Six hours after last dose of 
ketorolac, ibuprofen [ADDRESS_778639]  is unable to take NSAIDs, Tramadol 100 mg will be given orally 
4 times a day (start at 6:00 AM POD 1) for subject s younger than 65 years 
of age with no history of renal impairment or hepatic disease. The dose of tramadol will be reduced to 100 mg orally twice daily for subjects  65 years 
of age or older or whose creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min  
 All medications above may be substituted for a similar drug in the same 
class if a medication shortage occurs or an allergic reaction is documented.  
 
Breakthrough pain  
If pain is rated greater than [ADDRESS_778640] dose if the pain score 
remains above 5. Patient -controlled analgesia utilizing an IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_590681] 2 IV narcotic doses are deemed insufficient to keep the 
patient's pain score less than 5 using the NRS.  
  
3.3.4  Biological outcome measures  
 
Biological correlates will include assessment of salivary  cortisol levels, systemic levels 
of inflammatory cytokines  (IL-2, IL-6, TNF and CRP), and  changes in the phenotype of 
circulating immune cells, in order to quantify changes in stress and inflammation in patients who receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_590682].  
 Blood samples from enrolled subject s will be collected at the following specific time -
points : prior to surgery  and the [ADDRESS_778641] 3 tubes of blood ( ~30mL) at each time point to 
measure serum markers for inflammation and stress response (IL -2, IL-6, TNF, CRP) . 
Salivary cortisol levels will also be measured three times on the first post -operative day  
(morning, afternoon, evening) .  
    
Protocol UW14030 
Version 3, 11/14/[ADDRESS_778642]-operative data collection 
  
The Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is routinely performed by [CONTACT_590703]. In addition, a member of 
the research t eam will collect a Brief Pain Inventory (short form) on the first post-
operative day.  Missed pain scores will not constitute a protocol violation, though every attempt will be made by [CONTACT_590704]. Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_590683]. Total anti-emetic use and epi[INVESTIGATOR_590684]. Post -operative complications, including infections, bowel obstructions, deep 
vein thromboses, and pulmonary emboli, will be recorded. Time until return of bowel 
function (as defined by [CONTACT_590705]) will be recorded.  
 
Stress and inflammation serum markers will be drawn as part of the standard POD#[ADDRESS_778643] -operative day  (morning, afternoon and night). A Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) 
will be administered on the first day after surgery, to correlate perceived stress with salivary cortisol levels.  Subjects will fill out a patient satisfaction survey related to pain 
control (H CAHPS) at their post -operative visit. BPI [INVESTIGATOR_590685]. If 
the study team is unable to administer the questionnaires at the time of the post -
operative clinic visit, the study team may call the patient to administer the 
survey/questi onnaires over the phone or mail the survey/questionnaires to the subject 
within one month of the postoperative clinic visit.

4.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
4.1 Randomization  
 Simple unstratified com plete randomization will be performed electronically by [CONTACT_590706], as close to surgery as possible, preferably on the day of surgery.  
 
 
4.2 Analyses  
The primary endpoint of relative pain scores between the epi[INVESTIGATOR_590687] -epi[INVESTIGATOR_590688] a two- sided 95% confidence interval on the difference in mean 
scores between the two groups and concluding non- inferiority if this lies entirely below 2 points 
(mean non- epi[INVESTIGATOR_590689], within a 95% confi dence limit, to be at most 2 points 
worse than mean pain score in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_590677]). Secondary outcomes of length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210], patient satisfaction scores, average daily pain score for two days following surgery, length of time until return of bowel  function, total opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and stress and inflammation serum 
markers will be compared using two- sided 95% confidence intervals for their mean differences. 
Superiority tests at the two- sided .[ADDRESS_778645] -operative complications 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_590690] (where applicable).  
 
All analyses will be performed on an intent -to-treat basis, although as stated below 
noncompliance and losses follow -up are expected to be rare.  
  
4.3 Sample Size Calculations 
With 52 patients in each group and using a two- sided 0.5 critical value, there is 87% power to 
detect non- inferiority of the non- epi[INVESTIGATOR_590691] t he epi[INVESTIGATOR_590692] a mean 
difference in post -operative pain scores of [ADDRESS_778646] to follow -up. Therefore, up to 6 additional subjects may be accrued.

aspects of safety will be monitored as described in Section 7.  
 
 
5.0 RECORDS TO BE KEPT  
 All subjects will be entered into OnCore, the UWCCC research database. The following fields will be completed in OnCore: demographics, MR number, insurance type, consent  information, 
study ID#, subject statuses and dates, disease site and histology, enrolling staff .  Subject data 
will be managed by [CONTACT_978], resident researcher s (Co -Investigators)  and the UW Gyn -Oncology 
Research Office.  
  
Each subject will be assigned a unique, study  ID number. Study data will be stored with study 
ID numbers and will be kept indefinitely . Study data w ill be collected and managed using 
REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Wisconsin- Madison, School 
of Medicine and Public Health.  REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-
based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing: 1) an 
intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and 
export  procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common 
statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources.  Once the 
study is complete and REDCap is no longer needed, data will be exported from the sy stem 
and stored on the departmental network, which is secure and password protected. Access is 
limited to the study team and IT support staff.  Data within REDCap is maintained and archived 
per ICTR policy.   
 
Data will be collected directly from subjects, f rom study interventions and from medical record 
review. Data elements to be collected will include demographics, details of the enhanced 
recovery protocol, details of surgery and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779], diagnosis, pain scores, and adverse 
events (a complete data sheet is attached).  
             
Blood and salivary samples are collected as part of this study. Tissue banking is optional for 
study participants.  All specimens will be stored at UW Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590693]. These laboratory areas have limited access and remain locked when no laboratory personnel are present. Subject samples will be coded, removed of all direct 
identifiers, and linked to the password- protected study database.   
Since the UW Gyn- Oncology lab does not have the ability to test for cortisol levels, saliva 
samples will be sent to an outside lab for testing.  The UW lab will extract saliva from the 
collection swabs and then store the samples for batch shipment to the Laboratory for Biological Health Psychology  at Brandeis University where cortisol measurements are 
conducted on a fee -for-service basis.  Samples for shipment will be labeled with study number, 
subject ID number, specimen code (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening) . Brandeis will not have 
access to any direct identifiers or the code that links samples back to identifiers. Salivary 
samples will be exhausted or discarded after testing at Brandeis and only cortisol results will 
be returned to the UW study team.

 Additionally, 1- 2 mL of serum will be sent to an outside laboratory at Brigham and Women’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_297910], MA. Samples for shipment will be labeled with study number, subject ID 
number, specimen code (e.g.,  pre-op or POD#1). The lab will not have access to any direct 
identifiers or the code that links samples back to identifiers. Samples  will be exhausted or 
discarded after testing at Brigham  and only results will be returned to the UW study team. 
Samples will be centrifuged and then frozen at - 70-80°C and held for batch shipment to the lab

[ADDRESS_778647] to withdraw samples at any time by [CONTACT_590707].  
Blood samples will be used to analyze soluble molecules present in the serum and plasma. 
We will isolate immune and other cells present in the blood to determine if epi[INVESTIGATOR_590694]. The soluble molecules present in the blood will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_590708], NMR, ELISA, western blotting, and biochemical 
activity assays. The cells present in the blood will also be used in different immunologi cal 
assays. At the lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], serum will be analyzed for circulating 
microRNAs. Serum cytokine, CRP and cortisol levels may also be evaluated, to ensure results are similar to those collected in our own laboratories.  Salivary samples will be used to 
measure cortisol levels. Cortisol is a marker of physiologic stress, which also may be altered by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_44187].  
Blood collection: 30 mL of blood will be drawn from the patient prior to surgery . We will use this 
blood to examine the patient’s baseline immune response, by [CONTACT_590709]. A second blood draw (again, 30mL) will occur the first day after surgery. 
Whenever possible, blood samples will be drawn in conjunction with other clinically required 
blood tests in order to avoid unnecessary venipuncture.  
Salivary collection: A cotton swab will be brushed against the inside of the mouth (the buccal mucosa) at three different time points (morning, afternoon, and evening) on the first post -
operative day.

7.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
7.1 Oversight and Monitoring Plan  
 
The UWCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring 
data quality and subject safety for all UWCCC clinical studies.  A summary of DSMC activities 
follows:  
• Reviews all clinical trials conducted at the UWCCC for subject safety, protocol compliance, and data integrity.  
• Reviews all Serious Adverse Events (SAE) requiring expedited reporting, as defined in the protocol, for all clinical trials conducted at the UWCCC, and studies conducted at 
external sites for which UWCCC acts as an oversight body.  
• Reviews all re ports generated through the UWCCC DSMS elements (Internal Audits, 
Quality Assurance Reviews, Response Reviews, Compliance Reviews, and Protocol 
Summary Reports) described in Section II of this document.  
• Notifies the protocol Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_164360], if applicable, any requirements for corrective action related to data or safety issues.  
• Notifies the CRC of DSMC decisions and any correspondence from the DSMC to the protocol Principal Investigator.  
• Works in conjunction with the UW Health Sciences IRB in the review of relevant safety information as well as protocol deviations, non -compliance, and unanticipated 
problems reported by [CONTACT_15266].  
• Ensures that notification is of SAEs requiring expedited reporting is provided to 
external sites participating in multi -institutional clinical trials coordinated by [CONTACT_15267]. 
  
 
7.2 Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines  
 
Subjects will be assessed for toxicity throughout the study period. All grade 3 or greater 
adverse events, regardless of caus ality, that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590695]. Data 
Safety Monitoring Protocol Summary Reports will be provided to the UWCCC DSMC annually.

 7.3 Review and Oversight Guidelines  
7.3.1  Serious Adverse Event – Reported Within 48 hours  
Serious Adverse Events requiring reporting within 48 hours (as described in the 
protocol) must also be reported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) 
Chair via an email to [EMAIL_259] within one business day.  A 48 hr. 
initial “SAE Details” Repo rt, generated in the UWCCC database, must be attached to 
the email along with any pertinent information available at the time of initial reporting. 
The Committee Chair will review the information and determine if immediate action is required. Within [ADDRESS_778648] be 
submitted electronically along with a 48 hour follow -up “SAE Details” Report and a 
completed UWCCC SAE Routing Form to [EMAIL_259]. All information is entered and tracked in the UWCCC dat abase.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_15151], the IRB (as necessary) and provides documentation of these notifications to 
the DSMC.  
 See Section 7.4 for detailed instructions on SAE reporting.  
7.3.2  Serious Adverse Event – Reported Within 10 Days  
Serious Adverse Events requiring reporting within 10 days (as described in the protocol) must be reported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) Chair 
via an email to [EMAIL_259].   The OnCore SAE Details Report must 
be submitted along with other report materials as appropriate (any documentation 
available at that time of initial reporting). The DSMC Chair will review the information 
and determine if further action is required. All information is entered and tracked in the 
UWCCC database.  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_357335], the IRB (as necessary) and provides documentation of these notifications to 
the DSMC.  
 See Section 7.4 for detailed instructions on SAE reporting.   
 
7.3.3  Study Progress Review  
Protocol Summary Reports (PSR) are required to be submitted to the DSMC in the 
timeframe determined by [CONTACT_15273] (quarterly; semi -annually; or 
annually). The PSR provides a cumulative report of SAEs, as well as instances of non-compliance, protocol deviations, and unanticipated problems, toxicities and responses 
that have occurred on the protocol in the timeframe specified.  PSRs for those 
protocols scheduled for review are reviewed at each DSMC meeting.  
 
Protocol UW14030 
Version 3, 11/14/2016  
 
21 
 Protocol Summary Reports enable DSMC committee members to assess whether 
signif icant benefits or risks are occurring that would warrant study suspension or 
closure. This information is evaluated by [CONTACT_590710] (e.g., reports from Internal Audits, Quality Assurance 
Reviews , etc.) occurring since the prior review of the protocol by [CONTACT_6802].  
Additionally, the DSMC requires the study team to submit external DSMB or DSMC reports, external monitoring findings for industry -sponsored studies, and any other 
pertinent study -related information.  
 In the event that there is significant risk warranting study suspension or closure, the 
DSMC will notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_590696] (e.g., suspension or closure).  The DSMC ensur es that the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_15161] a clinical trial to the sponsor (e.g., 
NCI Program Director, Industry Sponsor Medical Monitor, Cooperative Group Study 
Chair, etc.) and other appropriate agencies. DSMC findings and requirements for 
follow -up action are submitted to the CRC.

 Study Overview  
This open -label  study is of current Acuvue ® Oasys ® wearers who are satisfied with their current lenses.  
Subjects will be refit into PRECISION1® contact [CONTACT_20930] [ADDRESS_652002] lenses are associated with less lens deposits, which decrease s 
associated comfort issues in lens wearers, including decreasing the risk of triggering Giant papi[INVESTIGATOR_145902] (GPC) and/or ocular allergic responses in patients.
[ADDRESS_652003] lens wear with planned replacement lenses.
3   The subjects in this study are current satisfied wearers of 2 week planned 
replacement lenses (Acuv ue® Oasys ®) and will be fit into PRECISION1 daily disposable contact [CONTACT_13276], 
which are less  likely to be associated with the already minimal risks of daily contact [CONTACT_13279].  
 
 
Key Endpoints:  
• Subjective assessment of P1 with CLDEQ -8  
  Version 4 
  25Jun2020  • Visual Analog Scale survey of lens wear symptoms (comfort, dryness, vision)  
• Assessment via q uestionnaire about qu ality of life , preference, and lens modality experience  
 
Study Time Points:  
A screening visit  will be conducted to consent the subject and determine eligibility.  Subjects should report 
to the exam wearing existing current Acuvue ® Oasys ® lenses with a copy of their current prescription or 
packaging.   Visual acuity and an evaluation of the subject’s ocular health will occur to determine eligibility 
including positively responding to the question, “Are you satisfied with your current Acuvu e Oasys contact 
[CONTACT_13276]?”  Acuvue Oasys lenses will be evaluated and optimized before dispensing a new pair of lenses for 
[ADDRESS_652004] udy when permissible by [CONTACT_505361]. Once the study resumes, patients can be dispensed an additional pa ir of study lenses to wear 
for one  week before their scheduled Visit 2.   
Visit 2: Acuvue Oasys contact [CONTACT_20931] 1 fitt ing visit .  Patient s will be asked if they 
are still satisfied with their current Acuvue ® Oasys ® contact [CONTACT_20932], lens fit 
and ocular health will be assessed.  Subjects will then be fit with PRECISION 1® Contact [CONTACT_505362], initial comfort , and initial vision.  Lenses will be dispensed and a contact 
[CONTACT_20934] -up visit will be scheduled.  
Visit 3: The contact [CONTACT_20935] 2  week s (±3 days) following the initial 
fitting.  Subje cts will have visual acuity, an assessment of ocular health , and lens fit completed.  Subjects 
will then complete surveys about their lens wear experience.  
  
Surveys (which will be deployed and completed in REDCap) will include:  
CLDEQ -8

 Recruitment  
  Version [ADDRESS_652005] of mouth referrals by [CONTACT_505363].  Emails to alumni of the OSU College of 
Optometry may be sent for local doctors to notify eligible potential subjects about t he study.  The use of 
ResearchMatch.org may also be requested as a recruitment method.  
 
Inclusion criteria :  
• Subjects must be current Acuvue ® Oasys ® spherical lens wearers.    
• Subjects must have 20/25 or better distance visual acuity  with current lenses . 
• Good general health (defined by [CONTACT_20937])  
• Ability to give informed consent  
• Willing to spend  time for the study .  Subjects will be required to attend two study visits 
and wear contact [CONTACT_20938].   
• Either gender  
• Any racial or ethnic origin  
Exclusion criteria :  
• No current ocular inflammation or infection as assessed by [CONTACT_505364].  A team member trained in the consent process will 
provide the consent document for the potential subject to read and will review the procedures with 
reference to the consent form. The individual is then provided with time to read the consent form and 
offered the opportunity to ask questions. The participant is explicitly told that they may stop participation 
at any time. All subjects will have the capa city to give informed consent. If there is any doubt as to the 
subject’s ability to consent to the study, the subject will be excluded from the study. If the subject agrees to take part in the screening or measurement, he or she will sign and date the most  recent IRB  approved  
consent form in REDCap.  The subject will be able to save a copy or print a copy of the document to keep 
for their records.   A team member will also sign the informed consent document in the REDCap system.  
The investigator team is tra ined in privacy issues and will be reminded of the importance of patient privacy 
prior to study initiation. Potential study participants will contact [CONTACT_20940], emails or 
hearing about the study by [CONTACT_6063], giving them the choice  of whether or not they wish to 
participate in a study for people with dry eyes.  Privacy is protected by [CONTACT_505365], and no other personal or medical information that should be private to the 
patients. The PHI n eeded is only for the purposes of this study. It is highly unlikely, indeed extremely 
remote that the dry eye symptoms or signs are related to private or personal information that should or 
  Version 4 
  25Jun2020  would be preferred to be kept confidential to the patients. Risk f actors for dry eye rarely relate to matters 
or conditions that would be personal to the patient such as personal relationships, behaviors or diseases 
that one prefers to keep private and confidential.  
 
Statistical Analysis and Power Calculation  
This small sample size was chosen for convenience as this study is not intending to prove superiority, but 
to study the acceptability of the study lens in previous successful Acuvue ® Oasys®  wearers.   
Statistical analysis will be reported with descriptive statistics a s this is not a comparative study.  
 Data Management and Security  
During the active stages of the study (recruitment to last measurement visit), all paperwork (consents, 
questionnaires and data forms) for each subject will reside in a subject folder for eas y access throughout 
the study. The folders will reside in the limited -access research area, in a locked file drawer or cupboard. 
At the completion of the study or disenrollment of a subject the paperwork in the subject’s folders will be 
reorganized into a regulatory binder (consents, W -9s) and a data binder (questionnaire and data forms) 
and will reside in an office in the limited -access research area. When the data analysis is completed and 
the study is considered complete, the binders will be stored in th e secure Department or Office Clinical 
Research Area. Paperwork (questionnaire and data forms) for individuals who participate in the baseline visit but are not eligible to continue the study will be stored in the study regulatory binder in an office in 
the limited -access research area. An electronic file of potential subjects and a file of enrolled subjects with 
their contact [CONTACT_3031], as well as electronic files of collected data with the subject number, will reside 
on a limited -access shared drive wit h firewall and password protection and is restricted to individuals in 
the research team. Any electronic data files that contain PHI will be destroyed at the conclusion of the study.  
 
Risks to Subjects and Mitigation Although rare, a subject could experien ce eye pain, changes in vision, continued redness or irritation of 
the eye when inserting or learning to insert a contact [CONTACT_13293]. More likely transient blurring of vision (less 
than one minute) or mild, transient (less than a minute) stinging may occur.  
 
Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be documented and reported under the guidelines of The Ohio State University 
Event Reporting guidelines, with any serious, unanticipated and related events being reported to the IRB, 
by [CONTACT_978], within [ADDRESS_652006] Dismissal  
  Version 4 
  25Jun2020  Subjects who, after study team member coaching, are not able to provide analyzable data may be 
dismissed from the study. Analyzable data is, for example, that which is obtained for the entire 
measurement interval and provides a readable eye image. Data may not be analyzable if patient isn’t able 
to stand or move freely to util ize the equipment , to name [CONTACT_505366]. These issues are usually 
revealed at the screening assessment visit. Subjects who cannot provide analyzable data will be dismissed 
for the study. Subjects who do not keep scheduled visits within the requir ed time frame will be dismissed 
from the study. Study team members will make reasonable efforts to accommodate subjects’ schedules.  
 
Protocol Violations, Discontinuation  
In the event that a member of the study team or a representative of sponsor becomes aware of a major 
protocol violation, the IRB shall be notified within 10 working days.

 1 OBJECTIVES   
1.1 Primary Objectives  
1.1.1 To determine the proportion of patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) 
and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_141940] (aCML)  who have a hematologic response to 
ruxolitinib (PR, CR, CRp) .  See table [ADDRESS_1126204] (defined in Table 6) 
and the median duration of maximum clinical responses . 
1.2.4 To determine the mean % reduction of spleen size , estimated by [CONTACT_813339] e llipsoid method  as measured  by [CONTACT_813340].  
1.2.5 To determine the mean % reduction of  total symptom score as measured by a 
modified MPN -SAF (see section 13.2)  compare d to start of study (day 1, cycle 1) . 
1.2.6 To determine overall survival in subjects who  complete a minimum of 1 dose of 
study drug.  
1.2.7 To determine the proportion of subjects who discontinue after  completion of  > 3 
cycles but < [ADDRESS_1126205] s who discontinue prior to completion of  
cycle 3.     
 
2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Study Disease  
CNL and aCML are both hematologic neoplasms characterized by [CONTACT_813341], absence of the Philadelphia 
chromosome (t(9;22); BCR -ABL1 ), and absence of platelet- derived growth factor receptor A/B  
(PDGFRA/B)  or fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1 ) gene rearrangements. CNL  is 
diagnosed based on expansion of neutrophils in both the blood and bone marrow (segmented neutrophils and band forms > 80% of white blood cells (WBC)) and is classified as a 
myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) according to World Health Organization ( WHO) diagnostic 
criteria. Cases of aCML  exhibit granulocytic dysplasia and increased numbers of neutrophil 
precursors in both the peripheral blood and the bone marrow (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] ≥ 10% of WBCs) and are 
therefore classified as one subtype of the WHO category  of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative 
 
 
  
Protocol Version 7: December 7, [ADDRESS_1126206] either been operationally defined by 
[CONTACT_813342] (e.g. BCR -ABL1  in CML) or are characterized by a high frequency of 
specific genetic abnorma lities (e.g. JAK2  V617F in polycythemia vera (PV), essential 
thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)6,8-11; KIT D816V in systemic 
mastocytosis12,13), the genetic basis of both CNL and aCML was unknown until recently.  Standard 
of care is not established for CNL and aCML and t he estimated median overall survival is 23.5 
months.14 
2.2 Study Agent(s)     
Ruxolitinib  (Jakafi, INCB018424) is a potent, and selective inhibitor of JAK1 (IC 50 = 3.3 ± 1.2 nM) 
and JAK2 (IC 50 = 2.8 ± 1.2 nM) with modest to marked selectivity against TYK2 (IC 50 = 19 ±  3.2 
nM) and JAK3 (IC 50 = 428 ± 243 nM), respectively.  Ruxolitinib  was FDA- approved in November 
[ADDRESS_1126207] -essential 
thrombocytosis  (ET) or post -polycythemia vera (PV) myelofibrosis.  More recently, a role for 
ruxolitinib for reducing disease burden in CNL and aCML was identified based on characterization 
of oncogenic CSF3R mutations.15  Ruxolitini b has high solubility and permeability. It is designated 
as a Class I molecule in the Biopharmaceutical Classification System and exhibits moderate- to-high 
clearance, volume of distribution and oral bioavailability in preclinical species.  
 
The pharmacology of ruxolitinib has been studied in both healthy volunteers and patients with hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. Ruxolitinib is more than 95% absorbed orally (regardless 
of food ingestion) with peak plasma concentrations occurring 1- 2 hours after dosing. (Investigator’s 
Brochure, Edition 11) The pharmacokinetics are linear and there is 97% plasma protein binding with limited penetrance across the bloodbrain barrier. The majority of drug is excreted in the urine (75%) 
with less than 1% excreted as un changed parent drug. The mean terminal half -life is 3 -5 hours, and 
it is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A4 resulting in oxygenated and 
conjugative metabolites. Twice daily dosing does not result in significant accumulation of the paren t 
compound or its metabolites. The total daily dose should be reduced by 50% when ruxolitinib is administered with moderate or potent  CYP3A4 inhibitors, but not dose -adjusted when given with 
CYP3A4 inducers.  
 
2.3 Other Agent(s)  
  Not applicable.  
2.[ADDRESS_1126208] identified gain -of-function mutations in the receptor for Colony Stimulating Factor 
3 (CSF3; GCSF), CSF3R, in ~60% of patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (BCR -ABL -negative) chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML).
[ADDRESS_1126209] also observed these 
mutations in ~1% of AML patients (Table 1).  CSF3R mutations predict for sensitivity of the 
malignant cells to JAK2 inhibition. These data suggest that JAK2 inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, 
would be beneficial thera peutic agents for the majority of CNL/aCML patients. Demonstration of 
the clinical efficacy of this proposed therapeutic strategy will require a prospective clinical trial 
where CNL and aCML patients are treated with ruxolitinib, and the response of patien ts harboring 
CSF3R mutations is monitored.

Table 1 . Summary of CSF3R 
mutational status by 
[CONTACT_813343]3R mutations in patients 
with CNL and aCML.  CNL – 
Chronic Neutrophilic 
Leukemia; aCML – atypi[INVESTIGATOR_279328], BCR -ABL -negative; AML – Acute 
Myeloid Leukemia; T -ALL – T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia; ETP -T-ALL – Early T -cell 
Precursor T -ALL; B -ALL – B -cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.  
 
CSF3R is the receptor for colony stimulating factor 3  
(CSF3; GCSF), and is thought to play a prominent role in 
the growth and differentiation of granulocytes16,17. CSF3R  
mutations have been described in patients with severe 
congenital neutropenia (SCN), which can evolve into 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML)18-20; it was recently 
reported that an SCN patient developed sequential acquisition of a secondary CSF3R  mutation at the time of 
AML transformation
21. These previously described 
nonsense/frameshift mutations truncate the cytoplasmic tail of CSF3R, impair its internalization, and alter its 
interactions with proteins such as SHP -1/2 and SOCS 
family members
22-24. These structural and functional 
alterations are thought to perturb the capacity of CSF3R 
to regulate granulocyte differentiation and to increase granulocytic proliferative capacity25-27. 
CSF3R signals through the JAK/STAT pathway, the non- receptor tyrosine kinase SYK28,29, and the 
SRC family kinase (SFK) LYN, which was recently shown to be mediated by [CONTACT_813344] -
[ADDRESS_1126210] 
extracellular of the transmembrane 
domain (membrane proximal 
mutations) and a small number 
resulting in truncation of the 
cytoplasmic tail (truncat ion 
mutations) (Figure 1).  By [CONTACT_187237], the 
most prevalent mutations are the 
membrane proximal mutations 
(T618I and T615A), which result in 
ligand independent activation of 
CSF3R signaling. The dominant downstream substrate in this 
context is JAK2. As such, ce lls harboring membrane proximal CSF3R mutations are exquisitely 
sensitive to ruxolitinib, with IC50s of ~100- 200 nM. An index patient with CSF3R T618I -driven 
CNL has been treated with ruxolitinib  for ~8 months and still exhibits a dramatic and durable Diagnosis  Mutation  Estimate of

 response with near normalization of white blood cell counts, and complete normalization of o ther 
blood parameters, including dramatic increases in platelet counts to normal levels (Figure 2).  
 
Finally, although truncation mutations are much less common, data from primary bone marrow 
colony assays suggest that cells harboring truncation mutations of CSF3R may be similarly 
sensitive to ruxolitinib , though these cells are also sensitive to inhibitors of SRC -family kinases 
(Figure 3).  
 
Collectively, these data argue 
strongly that ruxolitinib 
represents a promising 
therapeutic for the majority of  
patients with CNL and aCML  
and that these patients may exhibit 
durable, long- term responses to 
ruxolitinib, similar to the 
responses of CML patients to ABL 
kinase inhibitors. Currently, 
hydroxyurea is the only available 
therapy to control counts and 
sympt oms but does little to change 
the natural history of the disease.  In one report, the estimated median 
overall survival is 23.[ADDRESS_1126211] therapy
14.  Though 
CNL and aCML are not common forms of hematologic malignancy (estimate of several hundred 
cases per year in the U.S.),  the therapeutic benefit may be long- lasting for these patients and could 
convert these diseases into one that patients can live with.  
 
The clinical efficacy results of ruxolitinib  in the treatment of myelofibrosis have emerged from the 
ongoing Phase 1 /[ADDRESS_1126212] whether there is clinical benefit 
(defined in pri mary and secondary objectives) for treatment of these patients with ruxolitinib.  
  In this study, all subjects with a diagnosis of CNL or aCML will begin ruxolitinib  at a total daily 
dose between 5 mg and 40 mg (range from 5 mg qd to 20 mg bid) .  The star ting dose is based on 
the general dosing guideline provided in the ruxolitinib  prescribing information based on platelet 
counts for the treatment of intermediate to high ri sk myelofibrosis (Appendix B).  Within these 
parameters, we have defined specific do ses based on actual start of study (day 1, cycle 1)  platelet 
counts and on concomitant drugs categorized as moderate or potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors.   3

 2.5 Correlative Studies Background  
2.5.1 Correlative study: Correlate hematological responses  (defined in Table 6 and in 
section 13.2)  with  ruxolitinib  therapy to mutant CSF3R allele burden  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale:   Oncogenic CSF3R drives survival and proliferation of CNL and aCML cells in 
preclinical studies.15  Based on these studies, therap ies that specifically inhibit CSF3R or its 
downstream signaling pathways are expected to reduce survival and proliferation of CNL and 
aCML cells.  R uxolitinib  targets JAK1/[ADDRESS_1126213] of 
CSF3R activation, and is the basis for this clinical trial concept and its predicted efficacy in patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis:   We hypothesize that in cases of CNL or aCML that harbor mutant CSF3R, the 
mutant allele burden is reduced compared to start of study (day 1, cycle 1)  values and corre lates 
with hematological  responses to ruxolitinib.   
2.5.2 Correlative study: Identification of novel alternative and cooperating mutations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale:   Some patients who meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for CNL and aCML do not 
harbor mutations in CSF3R.  These patients may have alternative mutations downstream of 
CSF3R or mutations in a parallel signaling pathway that phenocopi[INVESTIGATOR_813307]3R.  Although we expect that most patients will respond to ruxolitinib, there may be cases of 
primary or secondary resistance to ruxolitinib  and these cases represent an opportunity to further 
characterize these alternative and/or cooperating m utations in CNL and aCML.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis:   We hypothesize that the development of CNL and aCML is limited to a few 
oncogenic drivers and the occurrence of primary or secondary resistance to ruxolitinib may 
represent alternative or cooperating mutations that c ould enhance our effort to study early and 
late steps in the pathogenesis of CNL and aCML.  
[ADDRESS_1126214] meet the following inclusion criteria:  
3.1.[ADDRESS_1126215] be newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed with CNL or aCML 
(please refer to  Appendix A) .  All patients must have a bone marrow biopsy completed 
during the screening or baseline period if one has not been done within [ADDRESS_1126216] platelet count greater than 25,000 per microliter at baseline and at 
the start of study (day 1, cycle 1)  visit.   
3.1.[ADDRESS_1126217] be able  to discontinue any drug treatment aimed at lowering disease 
burden in CNL or aCML.  Subjects should discontinue hydroxyurea to treat 
underlying CNL or aCML disease no later than Day - 7 (one week before starting 
ruxolitinib).   For drugs that have more long- lasting effects on the marrow, such as 
thalidomide and its analogs, and interferon, subjects should discontinue these no later 
than Day - 28.

 5 TREATMENT PLAN  
5.1 Agent Administration  
We propose that all subjects with a diagnosis of CNL or aCML (please refer to Appendix A ) will be eligible 
for treatment w ith ruxolitinib  on this study.  Initial doses of  5, 10, 15, or 20 mg BID will be administered 
based on platelet counts at the start of study (day 1, cycle 1) .  The FDA- approved prescribing information 
for ruxolitinib  dosing based on platelet counts is provided as a reference ( Appendix B ).  However, we have 
made additional suggestions where no specific guidance is provided but maintained the suggestions within 
the parameters outlined in the prescribing information.  We highly suggest adjusting the  starting dose if the 
subject is on  concomitant CYP 3A4 inhibitors , according to the table below.  However, whenever medically 
possible, we suggest avoiding potent CYP3A4 inhibitors  and to consult with the main study site for advice .  
Table 2 (below) serves to advise investigators on the initiation  of ruxolitinib on study, but the sponsor and  
site principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_813312].

† Common drugs listed as CYP 3A4 inhibitors and inducers are provided in Appendix D .  Drugs that are 
weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 or are CYP 3A4 inducers require no dose adjustment for the starting dose but 
the investigators may choose to adjust the dose at t heir discretion after observing platelet counts.  
 
‡ The suggested starting doses comply within the guideline provided in the ruxolitinib prescribing 
information.  However, the starting doses are further defined for patients who have platelet counts of less 
than 150,000 per microliter.  
For patients already on a stable dose of  ruxolitinib , when a moderate or potent  CYP3A4 inhibitor is 
to be  co-administered  during the clinical trial, the dose of ruxolitinib should be reduced by 
[CONTACT_3450] 50%.  
 
Treatment will be administered on a planned outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential risks 
associated with ruxolitinib  are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose modifications for ruxolitinib  are 
described in Section 6.  Doses should be taken by [CONTACT_813345], approximately 12 
hours apart, and without regards to food.   
 Subjects will bring all bottles of unopene d, empty, and opened/partially used study drug with them to each 
study visit. Investigative site staff will perform a count of returned pi[INVESTIGATOR_813313]. Study drug, 
including all bottles of unopened, partially opened or empty bottles will then b e returned to research 
pharmacy for storage.   
 
 
 
  
Protocol Version 7: December 7, [ADDRESS_1126225] is taking any agent categorized as a moderate or 
potent CYP3A4 inhibitor  (please see Appendix D ).  Dose adjustment is not required when ruxolitinib is 
co-administered with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers, but these agents should be used with caution in 
combination with ruxolitinib and alternative therapy used if available. U se of  moderate or potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors ( Appendix D ) is discouraged and investigators should seek other options where 
possible. For patients already on a stable dose of ruxolitinib, when a moderate or potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor is to be co- administered during the clinical trial, the dose of ruxolitinib should be reduced by 
[CONTACT_3450] 50%  and extra hematology assessments should be instituted for close monitoring of 
platelet levels.   
 
Anti coagulation/ Anti platelet Medications  
 Anticoagulation is allowed provided that platelet counts are maintained above 50,[ADDRESS_1126226] of care 
and over -the-counter doses of NSAIDs  and acetaminophen.   Subjects receiving over -the-counter NSAIDs 
should not exceed the recommended dose and should be encouraged to use gastroprotective agents (antacids, H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors).   
 
• Prohibited Anticoagulation/Antiplatelet:  
             Subjects requiring therapeutic  doses of anticoagulation or anti -platelet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_438949]                       
81mg daily, plavix or similar agents) AND platelet counts are below 50,000 on two different    
laboratory evaluations, separated by [CONTACT_813346].  Patients wh o meet these criteria 
are excluded from the study and are withdrawn from the study if other drug or dosing alternatives are not possible or if reduction of ruxolitinib dosing does not improve platelets to over 50,000 
per microliter.  
 
Hematopoietic Growth F actor Receptor Agonists  
 
Hematopoietic growth factor receptor agonists ( e.g., erythropoietin (Epo)  may be used at Investigator’s 
discretion in certain circumstances based on the clinical indications and risks/benefit considerations as 
described in the NCCN ESA guideline  
(http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/anemia.pdf ). 
 
• Prohibited Growth Factors  
Romiplostim or eltrombopag are not permitted beginning with the Baseline Visit (Day - 7)      
through the final dose of ruxolitinib.  
 
Other Prohibited Medications and Measures  
• Any prior or concomitant use of a JAK inhibitor  other than ruxolitinib . 
• Any investigational medication other than the study drugs  or any investigational agent

is non -compliant with the study requirements. Subjects may be withdrawn at the discretion of the Food and  
Drug Administration (FDA) or the investigator.  
 
Subjects must  discontinue study drug for the following reasons (investigators will review with the main 
study site appropriateness for continuing or discontinuing subject from study):  
• In the Investigator’s m edical judgment, further participation would be injurious to the subject’s 
health or well being

If the sponsor investigator or regulatory authority discovers conditions during the study that indicate that 
the study or study site should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation with 
the investigators.  The sponsor investigator has the right to terminate the participation of either an individual 
site or the study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the study may include the following:   
• Incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to 
subjects.  
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory.  
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete.  
• Investigator(s) do not adhere to the protocol or applicable regulatory guidelines in conducting the study.  
6 DOSI NG DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
Dose Adjustments  
If subjects experience thrombocytopenia with platelet counts less than 20,000 per microliter, ruxolitinib  
dosing should be held until the  platelet counts are above 25,000 per microliter .  The restarting dose should 
be as follows (Table 4):

Subjects with a grade [ADDRESS_1126235] the option to restart or re -escalate the dose with 
improving pla telet counts and the source of the bleeding has resolved.  
 
Table 5 outlines  the SUGGESTED approach for any grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic toxicity (refer to 
CTCAE for grading, reference in Appendix E ).  The investigators’ assessment of unrelated, possible, and 
definite causality to ruxolitinib guides the degree of dose reduction.  The investigators may choose to 
deviate from this approach or HOLD the study drug, based on safety and other medical considerations.

Protocol Version 7: December 7, [ADDRESS_1126237] is < 90% compliant, 
education on proper dosing will be provided to the subject and documented in source.  
 
Investigators may also decrease the dose for any reason based on their  clinical judgment, including  a more 
conservative approach based on hematologi cal abnormalities or non -hematologic safety findings.  
 
Dosing must be held if any of the following occur:  
• Platelet counts decline below 20,000 per microliter (dosing must be interrupted immediately).   
• ANC declines to less than 500 per microliter.  
• Ongoing Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage event . Ruxolitinib may be continued without hold if 
bleeding event is deemed ongoing from baseline or determined by [CONTACT_126463] [INVESTIGATOR_813314] .  
 
Dose Increases  
 
Dose increases are optional  and are at the discretion of the investigator . The investigator should refer to the 
prescribing information for ruxolitinib (Appendix B ) and Table 2 (Section 5.1) as a general guideline based 
on platelet counts and concomitant moderate and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.  Dose increases of 5mg daily 
or twice daily increments and no more frequent  than every [ADDRESS_1126238] had 
a sub -therapeutic response  (i.e., less than 25% reduction in white blood cells counts and absolute neutrophil 
counts ) can have  their dose increased to 25mg BID.  For most patients, the maximal dose w ill be [ADDRESS_1126239] of care .   
 
Note that when a 5 mg qd increment is added, creating a regimen such as 5 mg/10 mg, it is suggested that  
the higher dose should be taken in the evening and the lower dose in the morning.  
 
No dos e adjustment is recommended when ruxolitinib  is co-administered with a CYP3A4 inducer.  
Patients should be closely monitored and the dose titrated based on safety and efficacy.  
 
For subjects not on the maximum dose allowed for the study (ruxolitinib 25mg t wice daily) but meets the 
WBC and splenomegaly criteria (table 3) for disease progression, the investigator may increase the dose 
of ruxolitinib up to the maximum tolerated dose or maximum dose allowed for the study (subjects must 
maintain platelet counts greater than 20,000 per microliter, section 5.5).  The coordinating center will 
review the source data and provide suggestions to subsite investigators on dosing.   
 
The subject may stay on study if the WBC (>50% reduction) OR spleen size (>25% reduction by 
[CONTACT_2207]) is reduced after the subject is either on the maximum tolerated dose or the maximum dose 
allowed for the study for [ADDRESS_1126240] een size is controlled.     
 
 
 
  
Protocol Version 7: December 7, 2017  Page 19  
 Restarting ruxolitinib  after Recovery of Platelet or ANC Levels or Resolution of Hemorrhage  
• Note that the restarting doses should be reduced by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_1126241] 
was on at the time of the platelet or ANC level or hemorrhagic event that warranted dose 
interruption.  
• When dosing is held for ANC decline to less than 500 per microliter, dosing may be restarted when 
ANC is greater than 1,500 per microliter.  
• For Grade 2 hemorrhage events of any causality ( Appendix E ), dosing may be restarted at the prior 
level once the event is resolved to Grade 0, and its underlying cause has been alleviated or resolved, as long as platelet count and ANC do not preclude a restart at that dose level.   
• For Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage events of any causality ( Appendix E , requires a mandatory dose 
interruption), dosing may only be restarted provided: platelet count >20,000 per microliter and 
ANC  >1,000 per mi croliter , the event has resolved to Grade 0, and the underlying cause has been 
alleviated or resolved, and following discussion with the Study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_813315], resolution of the bleeding and underlying etiol ogy and likelihood of 
recurrence, in order to reach agreement that the potential benefits of a restart at an appropriate dose 
outweigh risks of recurrent hemorrhage.  Re -escalation by 5mg daily or twice daily increments and 
no more frequent  than every 4 we eks are suggested.  Investigators should exercise caution and 
closely monitor platelet counts around the time of the change or dose adjustment.  
  
Use of Platelet Transfusions Platelet transfusions may be used at Investigator’s discretion to treat thrombocytopenia. Dosing restart or 
increase decisions may not be based on platelet count values observed within 7 days of a platelet transfusion.  
 Management of Anemia  
Subjects with a hemoglobin level < 6.5 g/dL must receive red cell transfusion(s) to maintain a level of ≥ 
6.5 g/dL. Erythropoietin (EPO) use is strongly discouraged, but is permitted at the Investigator’s discretion  
in consultation with the Study Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461] , although use is not permitted in lieu of 
transfusions for hemoglobin below 6.5 g/dL.  
 
Optional Dose Tapering Strategy for Any Reason (medical indication, withdrawal from study, end 
of study, etc.)  
In ongoing clinical studies with  ruxolitinib, rapid return of constitutional symptoms and spleen growth has 
been observed in subjects after drug discontinuation.  When a decision is made to permanently discontinue  
ruxolitinib therapy for reasons other than low platelet counts or ANC leve ls, tapering of ruxolitinib dosage 
may be considered , based on evaluati on of the condition of the subject, current dose regimen and the clinical 
judgment of the investigator. Investigators may institute a tapering regimen according to what seems 
medically appropriate.  Doses of ruxolitinib may be very slowly lowered until the subject is completely off 
drug.  If medically indicated, doses of ruxolitinib may be temporarily restarted after they have been 
discontinued. If considered to be medically necessary, t he investigator may use any treatment to manage 
withdrawal from ruxolitinib including, but not limited to, the management of events which may be secondary to discontinuation, and interruption or reduction of dose administered of ruxolitinib. Short -term 
courses of high- dose corticosteroids, equivalent to doses of > 10 mg/day of prednisolone have been used to 
moderate the withdrawal of ruxolitinib and may be considered as part of a tapering strategy. Corticosteroids 
may be started prior to, or concurrent with , ruxolitinib tapering in anticipation of the possibility of 
occurrence of withdrawal symptoms. When a decision has been made to discontinue the subject with 
utilization of a tapering strategy, regardless of the use of concomitant medications, safety data will continue 
to be assessed in accordance with the protocol.  An End of treatment and subsequent Follow -up Visit must 
be scheduled.  
 
 
  
Protocol Version 7: December 7, [ADDRESS_1126242] an unclear relationship to study drug.  Refer to Table 5.  The investigator is 
encouraged to consult with the Study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_813316].  Any AE grade 3 or higher and RELATED to 
ruxolitinib requires mandatory reporting to the OHSU coordinating site within 24 hours of the site’s 
knowledge of the event.  Additionally, the inves tigator must notify the OHSU coordinating site via email 
before restarting study drug that was temporarily discontinued for an AE . 
 
Procedures for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
In the event that any subject discontinues the study drug and subsequently withdraws from the study prior to completion, regardless of reason, reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return for an 
Early Termination visit and have the End- of-treatment procedures completed as described in Section 10.  
 
The date t he subject discontinued the study drug and the specific reason for discontinuation will be 
recorded. This will include reasons such as discontinuation due to treatment failure or withdrawn due to adverse event. This information will be used to summarize th e reasons for study discontinuation and 
treatment failure.  
7 ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. The following list of 
AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristi cs of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event 
requires expedited reporting.   
All AEs grade [ADDRESS_1126243](s)  
Potential Risks:  
No specific findings in nonclinical repeat dose toxicity studies identify clinical risks other than noting that 
consequences of immunosuppression may occur. Hypotension and increases in heart rate were noted at a 
high dose in a cardiovascular preclinical s tudy. However, these findings have not been recapi[INVESTIGATOR_488234] a 
clinical setting.  
 
The primary clinical risks with ruxolitinib  treatment are the potential sequelae of decreased hematopoietic 
proliferation secondary to the inhibition of growth factor pathways by [CONTACT_166527]2 inhibition. Appendix F  lists 
the most common adverse effects.  Dose -dependent, reversible thrombocytopenia has been observed in 
subjects with MF and represents the DLT. The risk of spontaneous hemorrhage in patients as a result of 
thrombocytopenia generally does not become manifest until platelet counts fall below 10,000 per microliter 
(Slichter, 2004 ); platelet counts  below 25,000 per microliter (Grade 4) were not observed in any subjects 
initiating ruxolitinib  at starting doses of 10 mg bid or 15 mg bid in the ongoing phase 1 /[ADDRESS_1126244] had an apparent 
worsening of their pre -morbid disease symptoms following rapid cessation of ruxolitinib  therapy and a 
gradual tapering and use of steroids in fragile s ubjects may be considered when stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_813317].

 7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_1126245] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the 
CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .   
Expectedness: Adverse Events can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ (see Section 7.1 above for expected 
AEs) based on available safety dat a.   
Attribution of the AE : 
− Definite – the AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
− Probable – the AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
− Possible – the AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
− Unlikely  – the AE is unlikely  related  to the study treatment, but a causal relation cannot be 
 completely excluded . 
− Unrelated – the AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
7.2.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure 
specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. Abnormal 
laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute  adverse events only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
7.2.2 Serious adverse event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of 
causality that:  
• Resul ts in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at immediate risk 
of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form . 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a 24-
hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_450605]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur 
durin g the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs 
if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided 
that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery 
perform ed earlier than planned).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
 
 
  
Protocol Version 7: December 7, 2017  Page 22  
 • Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures.  
• Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen.  
• Emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria 
outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission. 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594].  
 
7.3 OHSU IRB Reporting of Unanticipated Problems and Adverse Events  
Unanticipated Problems (UP) and Adverse Events (AE)  will be reported to OHSU IRB  according to the 
policies, procedures and guidelines posted on the OHSU IRB web site:  
http://www.ohsu.edu/research/rda/irb/policies.shtml . 
 
Fatal and life -threatening events must be reported to OHSU IRB within 7 calendar days  after the OHSU 
Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_54813].  If any of these require a change (as determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_127833]) to the 
protocol or consent form, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_813318] y and submit the revised documents to 
the OHSU IRB.  
  All other UP reports will be submitted to OHSU IRB no later than 15 calendar days of notification of the 
event.  If the event requires changes as determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_127833]) to the protocol or cons ent form, 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_570272].  UP and AE reports 
are submitted through OHSU e -IRB and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_127869].  
 
7.4 Central Reporting of Adverse Events for Multicenter Studies  
The SAE/UP reporting for multicenter investigator initiated clinical trials   will follow the guidelines 
outlined in the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute Multi -Center Investigator Initiated Trials Coordinating 
Center Operations Manual.  
 A participating site must r eport an SAE to the  to the institution’s local IRB for action as required, as well 
as to the  OHSU coordinating center study team by [CONTACT_648], fax, or email within 24 hours of learning of the 
event. The participating center will send the coordinating center ma terials regarding the SAE including 
pertinent progress notes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813319], laboratory and radiographic studies, and 
the investigators’ assessment and report of the SAE. 
 
The OHSU coordinating center study team will review and submit SAEs to the FDA, OHSU IRB, and any 
other required contacts as required by [CONTACT_813349], OHSU IRB policy and/or 
federal regulations . The principal investigator [CONTACT_85681] O HSU Coordinating Center is responsible for 
distributing IND Action Letters or Safety Reports, as applicable, to participating institutions for review and 
submission to their institution’s local IRB.  
7.5 MedWatch Reporting  
 For this investigator -initiated stud y, the OHSU Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_593378]. The sponsor -
investigator  is required to report adverse experiences to the FDA through the MedWatch reporting program, 
even if the trial involves a commercially available agent. Adverse experiences to  be reported include any 
unexpected (not listed in the package label), serious adverse experiences with a suspected association to the

8 PHARMACEUTICAL AND/OR IMAGING AGENT INFORMATION  
 
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational or commercial agents administered in this study can be found in Section 7.[ADDRESS_1126246] of the inventor y and disposition of the study agent.  (See the NCI Investigator’s Handbook 
for Procedures for Drug Accountability and Storage).    
http://ctep.cancer.gov/investigatorR esources/investigators_handbook.htm
 
  
Responsibility for drug accountability at the study site rests with the Investigator; however, the Investigator 
may assign some of the drug accountability duties to an appropriate pharmacist or designee. Inventory and 
accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_570314].  
 
The Investigator or designee will be expected to collect and  retain all used, unused, and partially used 
containers of study medication until the end of the study. The Investigator or designee must maintain 
records that document:  
• investigational product delivery to the study site  
• the inventory at the site  
• use by [CONTACT_813351][INVESTIGATOR_4382]/unit counts from each supply dispensed  
• return to the Investigator or designee  
 
 
  
Protocol Version 7: December 7, 2017  Page 24  
 These records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers (if available), and the unique code 
numbers (if available) assigned to the investigational product and study subjects.  
 
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the protocol. The Investigator will also 
maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the correct study medication 
specified.  
 Completed accountability records will be archived by [CONTACT_779]. At the completion of the study, the 
Investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining study drug back to Incyte  for destruction 
according to institutional standard operati ng procedures. If local procedures mandate site destruction of 
investigational supply, prior written approval must be obtained from Incyte  or Incyte’s study drug 
distributor . 
 
Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual located in the separate Study Operations Man ual for details on 
drug supply, ordering and shipment process.  
8.2 Study Agent(s)  
Availability: Ruxolitinib  will be provided by [CONTACT_813352].   Each site will be responsible for contact[CONTACT_813353].  
Route of administration:  Doses should be taken by [CONTACT_813345], approximately 12 
hours apart, and without regards to food.  
Study Drug Packa ging, Labeling and Preparation:  Ruxolitinib  Phosphate tablets will be provided as [ADDRESS_1126247] contain the following language: “Caution: New Drug—Lim ited by [CONTACT_599357].”  
Incyte will be responsible for quality and stability of the drug for shipment to sites. Incyte will also 
communicate any information related to manufacturing issues and expi[INVESTIGATOR_813322]’s shipment.  
Study Drug Storage and Stability :  The bottles of tablets should be stored at room temperature, 15°C to 
30°C (59°F to 86°F).  Stability studies will be conducted on clinical batches to support the clinical trial.  
8.3 Commercial Agent(s) (if applicable)  
 Not applicable.  
9 BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
We will determine the mutational status  of CSF3R, the mutation type  of CSF3R, and the CSF3R mutant 
allele frequency. We will correlate these findings with patient clinical responses.  
 
Refer to the lab manual located in the separate Study Operations Manual  
9.1 Biomarker Studies  
Not applicable.  
9.2 Laboratory Correlative Studies  
Whole exome sequencing will be performed on genomic DNA isolated from patient peripheral blood, bone 
marrow specimens as well as germline skin biopsy specimens that are collected upon enrolment of patients 
on this trial. This will provide both qualitative and quantitative assessment of CSF3R and JAK2 mutational 
status as well as identification of other cooperating mutatio ns such as SETBP134. In addition, specimens 
 
 
  
Protocol Version 7: December 7, 2017  Page 25  
 from any patients exhibiting a clinical response, followed by [CONTACT_813354] -sequenced (whole exome) 
to understand genetic contributions to drug resistance. In this manner, we will be able to study possible 
mechanisms of primary res istance (from initial whole exome sequencing) as well as secondary resistance 
(whole exome sequencing of relapse specimens). Overall, this will involve whole exome sequencing of  
both pre-treatment  and post -treatment specimens in subjects with a response  to treatment and only pre -
treatment  sequencing in non -respondents who discontinue study prior to primary endpoint  (estimate for 
relapse based on experience of ABL inhibitors in CML; germline from enrolment specimen can be used to filter relapse sp ecimens). Finally, genomic DNA from all CSF3R -mutant enrolment and follow -up bone 
marrow specimens will be analyzed to assess CSF3R mutation allele frequency using a customized ion 
torrent CSF3R assay, as discussed below in Section 9.3. S pecial Studies.  
 
After testing exome sequencing is performed  and the subject has consented to the storage of samples for 
this study, remaining materials will be stored in a biorepository for future research . The excess sample will 
be processed and stored in the OHSU laborat ory, which is an NCI -approved biorepository ( OHSU eIRB# 
7267). The repository, which includes banked samples from participants with acute leukemia (AL) , 
lymphoproliferative disorders ( LPD ), myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ), and myeloproliferative diseases  
(MPD ). A primary goal of this repository is to store samples from patients with hematologic malignancies 
that can be made available to researchers at OHSU, the collaborating institutions, and commercial laboratories.
 
 
The b iorepository will include de -identified, coded samples from subjects  who consented to have their 
samples banked on this study; de -identified samples such as those from other institutions and cord blood 
samples, and “medical waste” samples such as left -over samples from the OHSU Clinical Flow Cytometry 
Laboratory and Clinical Leukapheresis Unit.  
 
Coded, de -identified samples will be processed and frozen in liquid nitrogen freezers. Currently, the 
repository has a capacity of 17,[ADDRESS_1126248] possible use, requests for 
samples will be reviewed for scientific merit and IRB compliance. The group assembled to revi ew sample 
requests will include the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_813323]/oncologists and co -investigators. Coded 
samples and the key linking patient identifiers to clinical data will be released to OHSU investigators 
following group review and IRB approva l from OHSU and the institution from which they were received. 
Only coded clinical information will be released.  
 
Samples may also be released to commercial laboratories. These samples will be de -identified and protected 
information will not be released.

10 STUDY PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULE OF EVENTS  
10.1 Screening/Baseline  
Screening and Baseline visit procedures can be combined in one visit or performed on more than one visit 
and will be completed within [ADDRESS_1126249] source data for verification 
of inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to subjects receiving drug on trial. Refer to the Study Operations 
Manual  for specific enrollment  instructions.   
10.2 Study Treatment Visits  
Each patient will be followed for a maximum of 96 weeks (24 cycles, 1 cycle is 4 weeks long) .  If the study 
drug continues to be effective, the patient may be eligible to continue on study drug past [ADDRESS_1126250] of care for CNL and aCML.  The schedule lists the mandatory data collected at each time point for the clinical trial but it is expected that additional tests/procedures or visits may occur as standard of care, 
which is entirely at the discretion of the investigator. Most patients will ha ve additional laboratory studies 
and clinical evaluations outside of this schedule as part of their standard of care.  Frequent monitoring is 
suggested for patients who have severe anemia or thrombocytopenia (f or example, Hgb <7 g/dL and platelet 
counts <30,000 per microliter).  The labs or studies outlined in section 10.8 schedule of events may be 
completed within 7 days of the target week (7 days before or 7 days after).  However, every effort will be 
made to adhere to this schedule as close as possible.  This is the minimum schedule of laboratory studies 
and follow -up visits required for the study
 
10.3 End of Treatment Visit  
Subjects will be evaluated  during Week 4 of Cycle 24 for end of treatment or  within 2 weeks  after 
stopp ing study drug. Every attempt will be made to devise a treatment plan weeks before the patient stops

there is a documented clinical benefit.  See section 6.0 regarding approach for tapering ruxolitinib.   
10.5 Study Assessments and Procedures  
 
Dose adjustments or the occurrence of hematologi c or non- hematologic grade 3 or 4 adverse events will 
require additional clinical evaluations and/or laboratory studies but should not be any less frequent than the 
schedule outlined.  
• Demographics and Medical History:   Demographic data and a complete medical history will be 
collected at visits prior to starting study treatment. Medical history in between visits should be 
documented at each study visit once study treatment has started. All transfusions including date, product 
transfused , number  of units,  and reason for transfusion should also be collected as part of the interval 
medical history.  
 
• Concomitant Medications:   All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the case 
report form (CRF).  Any prior medication received up to [ADDRESS_1126252]’s medical condition 
during the study will also be recorded in the CRF. Prior and/ or ongoing medications will be reviewed during screening to determine subject eligibility.  The medication record will be maintained following 
enrol lment including any changes to the dose or regimen. Prior and concomitant medication including 
any prescription, over the counter or natural/herbal /multivitamin  preparations taken will be recorded.  
 
• Physical Exam :  Physical exams must be performed by a medially qualified individual such as a 
licensed physician, Physician’s Assistant or advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner as local law permits. The physical exam at baseline should include the following organ or body systems per 
institutional standards: skin, hea d, eyes, ears, nose, throat, thyroid, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, 
extremities, lymph nodes. All other physical exams will include an evaluation of any AEs or any 
previously reported symptoms or prior physical examination findings.
 
Physical Exam must include an IPSS score  at each time point as described in the Schedule of Events  
(one point for each criteria , maximum of 5 points total ): 
 Age >65 y/o  
 Hgb <10 g/dL  
 Leukocytosis >25,000 per microliter  
 Peripheral blasts > or = 1%  
 Weight los s of >10%  of average adult weight  prior to leukemia diagnosis , or presence of 
disease- related night sweats or fevers  
 
 
 
  
Protocol Version 7: December 7, 2017  Page 28  
 • Performance Status :  ECOG will be determined and performed at the visits indicated in the schedule 
of events in section 10.8. Refer to Appendix C for ECOG scale . 
 
• Pregnancy Test:   A urine pregnancy test is required for all female subjects during screening for women 
of childbearing potential. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, serum pregnancy tests must be 
performed per institutional standards.  
 
• Weight :  Must be collected at e ach study visit  
 
• Height :  Must be collected prior to day of study treatment.  
 
• Vital Signs :  Vital sign measurements should be taken per institutional standards at each study visit.  
 
• Complete Blood Count :  Local hematology will be collected per institutional standard  of care and 
must include  an extended differential , hematocrit and  MCV . The exact values of the extended 
differential profile is per local institutional standard of care.  
 
• Coagulation panel:  INR /PT and aPTT are required.  
• Chemistry :  Local c hemistry will be collected per institutional standards and must include LDH and 
uric acid.  
 
• Spleen size :  In this study, s pleen size is only estimated by [CONTACT_2207] (limited ultrasound or full 
ultrasound per standard of care ) at the mandatory time points  as indicated in  the schedule of events. 
Spleen volume will be calculated by [CONTACT_813355] e llipsoid method. Measure spleen width, 
thickness and maximum length in centimet res. Multiply width by [CONTACT_813356] 0.[ADDRESS_1126253] dimension (centimetres) in the cranio -caudal axis is  
also recorded.  A percentage of change will be calculated at the mandatory time points as indicated in 
the schedule of events  in cases when only 2 dimensions are available . Studies completed within 2 
months of start of drug date are a cceptable for baseline evaluation. Additional u ltrasounds  may be 
completed during the study per investigator discretion.  Beyond the mandatory ultrasounds to 
estimate spleen size, Investigators  should estimate spleen response  by [CONTACT_813357] t hroughout the study and can be recorded in the clinical evaluation  and in M edidata. .  If the 
clinical assessment suggests disease progression ( refer to table 3), the investigator will perform 
repeat labs, bone marrow evaluation, and ultrasound of the spleen as part of standard of care to 
confirm  the presence or absence of suspected disease progression.  
 
• Bone Marrow Exam:   A bone marrow exam aspi[INVESTIGATOR_813324]. Additional bone 
marrow evaluations may occur if clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator, e.g., at the 
time of suspected disease progression or disease remission.  An independent hematopathologist (s) not 
involved in the study will adjudicate availablebone marrow biopsy slides  to enhance the assignment 
of the diagnostic category for each subject given some existing arbitrary or ill -defined WHO criteria.   
 
If a bone marrow exam  has been done within the last [ADDRESS_1126254] been performed and the sample is of sufficient quality for interpretation . Investigators from other sites may consult with the 
coordinating center (OHSU  Coordinating C enter ) if necessary to help make this determination.

Ruben Mesa to assess total sy mptom score35. A simplified version is based on the [ADDRESS_1126255] common 
symptom s associated with MPNs. The total score is the sum of each symptom scored on a 0 to 10 scale 
(0 describes no symptoms  and 10 is maximal symptoms ). The maximum total score is 100.  If subject 
does not circle a line within the survey (skipped question), the data is considered missing and then the denominator of total symptom score will be changed  to the total number of questions answered. If more 
than one value is circled by [CONTACT_813358] a single value. 
 
 
• Adverse Even t assessment s: Toxicities and adverse experiences will be assessed at each visit using 
the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0.  See Appendix F  for grading of the most 
common adverse events and side effects with ruxoli tinib. Unexpected grade 3 or 4 adverse events 
(according to CTCAE term (AE description)) categorized as definitely or possibly attributed to 
ruxolitnib will also be recorded and reported as indicated in s ection  7. 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
 
 All AEs grade 3 and greater and all SAEs, regardless of grade, will be recorded in the CRF.

§Some  subjects will not perfectly meet all the criteria  (WBC/ANC, marrow findings, or spleen size)  in any 
one of these categories (CR, PR, SD, or progression) .  The coordinating center will confirm each parameter 
separately an d will choose the best category that reflects the overall hematologic response  based on source 
documentation.  Three  or more  reviewers (co-PIs) will review a summarized table of these parameters with 
redacted data  and also assign the category that best fits the hematologic response  in evaluable subjects  at 
cycle 7, week 1 . The overall consensus and rationale for each response assessment will be d ocumented. 
Subjects not reaching cycle 7, week 1 are considered non -responders unless otherwise indicated. In addition 
to overall response , the change in each parameter (WBC/ANC, marrow findings, or spleen size) at cycle 7, 
week 1  and at end of study compa red to baseline will be reported and evaluated separately.

To measure the antitumor effects of ruxolitinib  on CNL or aCML cells, subjects’ white blood cell count 
and absolute neutrophil count will be determined according to the suggested schedule. All of these 
laboratory parameters are expected to be elevated above the standard cut -off for normal control patie nts. 
The mutant CSF3R allele burden is expected to correlate with tumor burden.

12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Study Design     
This is an open label single -arm phase II clinical trial  of ruxolitinib  in patients with CNL and aCML. The 
study is comprised of 4 stages:  
1) Screening:  up to 4 weeks.  
2) Baseline:  up to 2 weeks.  
3) Treatment : up to 96 weeks (extended if benefit to the patient).   
4) Follow -up: and end of treatment visit will occur within [ADDRESS_1126271] some degree of hematologic response with 
ruxolitinib treatment .  Ou r observation that a patient with membrane proximal mutation had an excellent 
clinical response to the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, resulting in a marked decrease in the numbers of white 
cells and neutrophils and an increased platelet count, constitutes a pr oof of concept. Although anecdotal, 
 
 
  
Protocol Version 7: December 7, 2017  Page 40  
 this observation provides an impetus for further investigation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment 
of patients with CNL and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_443839] .15 
 
 
Primary Endpoints:  
 
The primary objective  of this study is to  determine the proport ion of subjects with a hematologic response 
to ruxolitinib  (PR, CR, CRp, as defined in Table 6).  The primary endpoint is the indicator variable of 
whether a patient has achieved.  
 A subject is defined as being responsive if he or she has achieved PR, CR, or CRp, determined at 
the clinical and laboratory evaluations performed at  either  the beginning of cycle #7 and/or at the 
end of treatment visit compare to start of study (day 1, cycle 1) . 
 A subject is defined as a non- responder if he or she does not reach cycle 7, week 1 unless otherwise 
specified.  
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
 We will evaluate safety endpoints, including:  
 The indicator variable for any  hematologic grade III or IV adverse effects for thrombocytopenia, 
anemia, and neutropenia at any time point.  
 The indicator variable for  any grade III or IV adverse events or any effects/toxicities direc tly 
attributed to study drug requiring permanent cessation of drug (refer to Appendix F ). 
 
We will evaluate these other endpoints, including:  
 The indicator variable for whether a patient has achieved  clinical responses of PR  or better at the 
clinical and laboratory evaluations perform ed at the beginning of cycle #[ADDRESS_1126272] a 
more than 25 % reduction in mutant CSF3R allele burden  with ruxolitinib  therapy  compare to start 
of study (day 1, cycle 1) .  
 The indicator variable for drop- off and the time of drop- off since treatment.  
 The indicator variable of droppi[INVESTIGATOR_813332] 3.  
 The indicator variable of droppi[INVESTIGATOR_813333] 3 and 6.  
 The indicator variable that subjects has reached cycle 7.  
 Maximum clinical responses  
 Duration of maximum clinical responses.  
 Reduction of spleen size evaluated by [CONTACT_813369] #7 compare to start of 
study (day 1, cycle 1) . 
 Reduction of  total symptom score as measured by a modified MPN -SAF at the beginning of cycle 
#7 compare to start of study (day 1, cycle 1) . 
 Overall  survival in subjects who complete minimum of 1 dose of study drug.  Verification of status 
(living or deceased) and caus e of death will be attempted , by [CONTACT_813370], up to 5 years after 
enrollment in the study.  
 Clinical benefit and response  analysis  will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_813371].  
2015;125(12):1857- 1865  
12.3 Analysis Populations  
Safety and efficacy analysis will be conducted on every patient who consents and takes study drug, 
regardless of how long they stayed on study drug.  The end of treatment and early termination visit (see 
schedule) includes an evaluation of response at that  visit.   Reason(s) for going off study will be collected 
 
 
  
Protocol Version 7: December 7, 2017  Page 41  
 on every patient.  
12.4 Statistical Analysis Plan   
Descriptive statistical analysis will be conducted for all primary and secondary endpoints.  In particular, we 
will compute proportions with 95% exact con fidence intervals for categorical variables, and report the 
summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range) for continuous variables .  An 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_813334], CSF3R allele burden, spleen size, and total symptom score. Chi -square tests will be used to 
assess the association between hematologic response and mutant CSF3R type, and “≥ 50% reduction mutant 
CSF3R allele burden”. Odds ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  
Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to illustrate and summarize overall survival in subjects who complete 
the study.  
 Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_190060], dura tion and severity of adverse 
events, performing physical examinations, collecting vital signs, collecting laboratory data for hematology, 
serum chemistry, and coagulation parameters.  Proportion of subjects with new onset of Grade [ADDRESS_1126273] functions of time to 
onset of the above two safety measures will be estimated using life table me thod.  
 
Clinical Laboratory Tests  
The clinical laboratory data will be analyzed using summary statistics ( e.g., means and frequencies), and 
no formal statistical comparisons among the treatments are planned.  
12.5 Sample Size and Power  
This study has an  accrual goal of 25 evaluable  subjects who reach cycle 7, week 1. Using the criteria that 
has been generally accepted in  general oncology practice, we consider the therapy promising if it has an 
estimated 30% or more response rate (including CR, CRp, or PR, defined in Table 6 , reference 36 ).  The 
null hypothesis to be tested is 10% response rate36. CNL and aCML are rare diseases with no established 
standard of care or effective drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  As a result, there is no best available therapy to compare to.  
Based on Simon’s two -stage Minimax design, a total of [ADDRESS_1126274] will achieve 80% power at 5 % 
significance level, with an interim look planned upon the available of primary endpoint for the first 15 
evaluable subjects ( i.e., [ADDRESS_1126275] reached the beginning of cycle #7). The trial will be stopped for 
futility if 1 or 0  subjects responded (response is defined as PR or better)  for the first 15 subjects .  Under the 
null hypothesis, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16505] 0.549. The expected sample size is 19.50 for 
the two -stage design. By [CONTACT_124808] (assuming the t rial did not get stopped early for futility), if 6 
or more subjects responded  (out of a total of 25), then the drug will be claimed as effective.  We expect that 
each site will on average accrue [ADDRESS_1126276] that the majority of subj ects will be 
enrolled by [CONTACT_68089] 3.  Considering the drop- off rate of ~ 50%, we may end up accruing [ADDRESS_1126277] s for the 
trial (with only 25 evaluable for the primary endpoint) .  
12.6 Randomization Method  
Not applicable.   
12.7 Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to obtain data at the defined time points as described in the primary and 
secondary endpoints .  The l abs or studies outlined in section 10.3, schedule of events, may be completed 
within 7 days of the target week (7 days before or 7 days after).  H owever, every effort will be made to 
adhere to this schedule as close as possible.    For time points that have no data, we will evaluate whether or 
not the other time points can be used to fulfill the primary and secondary data.  If  the data is not sufficient 
 
 
  
Protocol Version 7: December 7, [ADDRESS_1126278] ’s data may be excluded entirely or partially, depending on the 
specific endpoints in question and in consultation with the biostati stician.

5.1 Thrombocytopeniaa, Anemiab, and Neutropeniac Treatment with ruxolitinib  can cause 
thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia. [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1)]. Thrombocytopenia was 
generally reversible and was usually managed by [CONTACT_813374] . 
Platelet transfusions may be necessary [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2), and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]. 
Patients developin g anemia may require blood transfusions and/or dose modifications of Jakafi. Severe 
neutropenia (ANC less than 0.5 X 109/L) was generally reversible. Withhold ruxolitinib  until recovery 
[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]. Perform a pre -treatment complete blood count (CBC) and monitor CBCs

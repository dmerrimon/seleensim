3 Introduction and  Rationale  
3.1 Acne Vulgaris  Introduction  
Acne vulgaris, commonly referred to as acne, is a very common chronic inflammatory skin 
disease affecting approximately 80 - 90% (50 million) of adolescents and young adults in the 
[LOCATION_002] ( 1, 2, 3). Increased production of sebum and colonization of the bacteria 
Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] (P. acnes ) in the sebaceous glands are key factors in the 
development of acne vulgaris. Retention of sebum results in formation  of comedones which 
may become inflamed and develop into pustules or deep -seated nodules in more severe cases. 
Moderate to severe acne vulgaris can reduce the quality of life and self -esteem and result in 
disfiguring persistent scarring and dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371]  (4, 5). Current available topi[INVESTIGATOR_472068] 3 to 6 months and are 
often associated with some degree of local side effects during  the treatment period (e.g., 
dryness, skin irritation, scaling). This often reduces compliance, and consequently leads to 
disease relapse and disappointing treatment outcomes.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_605163]  
LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel is a novel ingenol deriva tive being developed for field treatment of actinic 
keratosis  (AKs)  on face,  balding  scalp  and treatment  areas  of up to 250 cm2 (40 in2) on the 
chest. LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel is in phase 3 of its clinical development  program.  
 
Please refer to the Investigator's Brochure of [ZIP_CODE] gel in Actinic Keratosis Edition 4 or any 
updates hereof for all relevant non -clinical and clinical information. Refer to the 
Investigator’s  Brochure  Addendum  for Acne  Vulgaris  for additional  information  pertaining  to 
this exploratory  trial. 
 
3.3 Trial  Rationale  
There is an unmet medical need for safe acne vulgaris treatments of short duration with good 
efficacy and the ability to improve the patient’s disease related quality of life.  
 
The clinical rationale for investigating the efficacy of LEO [ADDRESS_605164] of ingenol mebutate gel on the sebaceous gland ( 6) may be  
 
EXP -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 9 of 87  
  
similar to the effects observed for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in combination with 
aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) in the treatment of acne vulgaris ( 7). 
 
The first case indicating beneficial effects of ingenol mebutate involved a female employee at 
an ingenol mebutate manufacturing site suffering from acne. The employee accidentally 
became exposed to a large dose of dry -powder ingenol mebutate in the face. Following 
complete resolution of a severe facial skin response, the pre -existing acne vulgaris also 
cleared. In the second case, a female laboratory technician at an academic research laboratory 
was accidentally exposed in the face to an ingenol containing  extract from the E. peplus plant. 
She also recovered completely from a severe skin response and later reported that her pre - 
existing acne vulgaris had cleared.  
 
The scientific rationale for investigating LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel as a treatment for acne vulgaris is 
based on the observation that ingenol mebutate has a stronger local skin response (LSR) 
around the hair follicles ( 6), suggesting accentuated cell death and inflammation in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_249568] (refer to the Investigator's Brochure of [ZIP_CODE] gel in Actinic Keratosis 
Edition 4 or any updates hereof for details on mode of action). This could reduce the size of 
the sebaceous gland and possibly have a beneficial effect on acne vulgaris similar to the effect 
of PDT with ALA ( 7). 
 
In ALA -PDT the ALA serves as a precursor for the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. This 
molecule has significant phototoxic effects in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_472069] l ight ( 8, 9). Histologically, ALA -PDT therapy 
induces severe cell damage and cell death in the sebaceous gland epi[INVESTIGATOR_472070] a 
reduced gland size and sebum production ( 7). Studies have shown improvement of acne 
vulgaris disease severity for up to 20 weeks after therapy ( 7,10, 11). Clinically the ALA -PDT 
therapy is a ssociated with transient erythema, crusting edema, temporary changes in 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_472071] ( 11) similar to the local skin responses observed after 
treatment with ingenol mebutate.  
 
Based on this, we hypothesi ze that the inflammation and local skin response induced by [CONTACT_82093] 
[ZIP_CODE] gel may improve acne vulgaris by [CONTACT_175404] 1) the size of the sebaceous glands, 2) the 
sebum production and 3) the colonisation of P.acnes . 
 
The objective of this explorative trial is to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of LEO 
[ZIP_CODE] gel in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Efficacy will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_472106]’s global assessment (IGA) of the treatment areas. In 
addition, the effects  of LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel on inflammatory biomarkers, microbiome profile and 
cosmetic skin appearance will be investigated.  
 
EXP -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 10 of 87  
  
3.3.1  Dose  Selection  
LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel has not previously been administered to subjects between 18 and 35 years of 
age with acne vulgaris. Previous clinical trials with field treatment for actinic keratosis (AK) 
in the face included only subjects over [ADDRESS_605165] shown good tolerability and safety of LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel 0.018% when used in a 3 - 
day once daily dosing regimen (refer to Investigator's Brochure of LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel in Actinic 
Keratosis, Edition 4 or any updates hereof) and i s currently under development for AK. In this 
clinical trial the same strength of LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel 0.018% is selected for once daily treatment 
for up to three consecutive days.  
 
It is unknown whether the subjects with acne in this trial will have a different safety profile 
and LSR profile compared to the subjects investigated in the AK clinical trials. To ensure the 
safety of the subjects with acne vulgaris in this trial, additional safety measures (described in 
section 6.1 and se ction 12) have been adapted to ensure early detection of unexpected severe 
adverse events (AEs), LSRs and poor tolerability.  
 
The safety and tolerability data will be reviewed by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) during 
the trial (section 12). 
 
3.[ADDRESS_605166] performed before, during and at End of Trial to ensure 
that no pregnant wom en are exposed to LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel. Female partners of male subjects are 
not required to use contraception as described in section 7.3.6 of the Investigator's Brochure 
of LEO [ADDRESS_605167] signed the informed consent form (refer to 
section 17.3). The informed consent will highlight that LSR and treatment related AEs (such 
as pruritus and pain) are common events. In addition, the subjects will be informed that both 
the acne vulgaris disease severity and skin appearance (including textur e, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scars)  
 
EXP -[ADDRESS_605168] for several months or longer.  
 
As noted in section 3.3.1 , all safety data on LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel stems from studies in subjects 
older than 40 years of age, with Fitzpatrick skin type I -III and the diagnosis of AK. In these 
subjects clinical findings following tre atment are localised application site reactions (e.g., 
pruritus, pain, irritation) and local skin responses (LSRs), particularly erythema, oedema, 
flaking and scaling. These LSRs are transient and typi[INVESTIGATOR_472072] [ADDRESS_605169] few days. No data 
involving young adults or individuals with pre -existing inflammation in the treatment a rea are 
available and it is thus unknown whether the LSRs will be different in this trial.  
 
To limit the number of exposed subjects, this early phase explorative clinical trial is designed 
as a left/right comparison within -subject. This design requires fewer subjects to achieve 
statistical power to detect a difference between treatments than a tr ial with comparison of 
treatments between -subjects. The vehicle gel control serves as an external validity check of 
the trial results and shows what an agent -free therapy contributes in terms of efficacy and 
safety.  
 
Moreover, to mitigate the risk of unexp ected severe LSRs and AEs, the trial includes a small 
treatment escalation cohort with continuous safety review (refer to section 6.1), and 3 
subsequently treated cohorts separated by [CONTACT_472107] a 
Safety Review Comm ittee (refer to section 12). 
 
Subjects participating in this trial will be under the supervision of an experienced investigator 
during the course of the trial. The subject’s safety will be monitored daily (Day 1 to Day 4) 
and closely during the follow up -period until [ADDRESS_605170] bacterial swab, respectively ( Appendix 2 ). 
This will be done at visit 2, 7, 8, 9 a nd 10. Both procedures may cause minor transient redness 
(less than 1 hour) and without long -term risks.  
 
EXP -[ADDRESS_605171] digital photographs taken at Day 1 and 
all subsequent visits ( Appendix 3 ). These are used for documentation.  
 
The FDA guidance for developi[INVESTIGATOR_472073] ( 12) recommends 12 weeks of 
treatment and 4 weeks of follow -up after end of treatment. These recommendations are not 
considered relevant for this trial in which the treatment period is only once daily for up to 3 
days due to the mode of action of LEO [ZIP_CODE]. The efficacy endpoints (total lesion count and 
investigator global assessment) are chosen in accordance with the FDA guideline, but 
evaluated at follow -up after end of treatment at Week 2, 4, [ADDRESS_605172] topi[INVESTIGATOR_472074] [ZIP_CODE] gel, 0.018%, once daily, for one, two or three consecutive days on t he cheeks

whether LEO [ADDRESS_605173] -report ed outcomes using the acne -specific quality of life questionnaire 
(Acne -QoL, ( 13, 14)) and the treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication (TSQM II,

6 Trial  Design  
6.1 Overall Trial  Design  
This is an exploratory clinical (phase 2a), single -centre, prospective, randomised, vehicle - 
controlled, double -blinded, intra -individual comparison, split -face model (left/right design) 
trial. Subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris will be treated with LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel 
0.018% and vehicle gel (i.e. the Investigational Products (IPs)). The IPs are administered as a 
thin wet layer to each treatment area (TA) on the left (TA left) and right (TA right) cheeks of the 
face, each area corresponding to approximately 36 cm2 (refer to section 10.2.1 ). Assessments 
during the trial are outlined in section 8.1. 
 
The subjects will b e enrolled sequentially into 4 cohorts (n=40 total).  
 
Progression from one cohort to the next will be decided after a review of LSRs, safety and 
tolerability by [CONTACT_472108] 2 (Visit 7).  
 
Handling of LSRs, safety or tolerability deemed unacceptable is described in section 12. 
 
Cohort 1 (n=3) : Treatment escalation with once daily application of IPs for one, two and 
three days respectively for each of the first three subjects.  
 
Subjects will enter treatment sequentially such that the second and third subjects only are 
exposed after a safety evaluation of the preceding subject is done. The first subject will be 
dosed for one day only, the second subject up to two days and the thir d subject up to three 
days.  
 
EXP -[ADDRESS_605175] treatment day depends on the following 
criteria:  
 
• The subject not reporting intolerable response to  treatment.  
• The investigator not evaluating LSRs or treatment -related AEs to be  unacceptable.  
• The LSR scores not exceeding predefined criteria (see Table 1, section 6.1). 
 
Subjects not receiving the optional treatment on Day 2 and/or Day 3 due to severe LSRs or 
treatment related AEs will remain in t he trial and attend the scheduled follow up visits.  
 
Cohort 2 (n=6) : Once daily treatment for three days with the second and third day optional 
dependent on predefined criteria (see ‘Treatment Phase’ below) Two subjects may initiate 
treatment per week. The subjects will follow the same scheduled visits as in cohort 1.  
 
Cohort 3 (n=6): Once daily treatment for three days with the second and third day optional 
dependent on predefined criteria (see ‘Treatment Phase’ below). Subjects may be enrolled 
without restrictions to the number of subjects per week. The subjects will fol low the same 
scheduled visits as in cohort 1.  
 
Cohort 4 (n=25) : Once daily treatment for three days with the second and third day optional 
dependent on predefined criteria (see ‘Treatment Phase’ below). Subjects may be enrolled 
without restrictions to the number of subjects per week. The visit on Day 8 will be conducted 
as a phone call visit.  
 
The trial consists of the following phases: 
Screening Phase (Day -28 to Day -1) 
Following careful information about the protocol, LSRs and other risks, the subjects w illing 
to participate in this clinical trial must sign the trial specific informed consent. Screening and 
Day 1 may be combined.  
 
EXP -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 16 of 87  
  
At the screening visit, the diagnosis of acne vulgaris will be confirmed by [CONTACT_941] 
(sub)investigator and the ov erall disease severity will be assessed using the IGA of the full 
face (Table 4 in section 8.15). 
 
Two symmetrically located TAs on the left (TA left) and right (TA right) cheeks of the face will 
be identified by [CONTACT_941] (sub)investigator and documented on individual transparent film(s) using 
a three -point landmark technique as (described in Appendix 10 ). The (sub)investigator will 
assess disease s everity in TA left and TA right by [CONTACT_472109]. In addition, the 
symmetry of the total lesion count when comparing TA left and TA right will be assessed (refer to 
criteria 4 in section  7.2). 
 
The subject’s elig ibility for the trial will be checked according to inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  
 
If a subject is ineligible due only to current or recent use of prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], he/she may 
be re -screened after a washout period . A decision to stop an ongoing therapy should always be 
discussed and approved by [CONTACT_941] (sub)investigator.  
 
If the subject is eligible, assessments listed in section 8.[ADDRESS_605176] performed.  
 
Pre-treatment Phase (Day 1)  
 
If the Day 1 (Visit 2) is not combined with the Screening (Visit 1), eligibility must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_472110]. Following 
randomi zation, the subject must complete the AcneQoL questionnaire before any other 
assessments are undertaken in addition to safety assessments.  
 
Women of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test performed.  
 
In Cohort 2, 3 and 4, non -invasive samples from the skin will be taken for evaluation of 
inflammatory markers, skin microbiome profile (For details see Appendix 2 and Appendix 4 ). 
 
Subjects in C ohort 1, 2 and 3 will be photographed at all site visits from Day 1 and onwards 
for documentation of physical appearance ( Appendix 3 ). Photographs will be taken at 
screening for Cohort [ADDRESS_605177] will be left/right randomised to receive active treatment on TA left or TA right. The 
other side will be treated with vehicle gel.  
 
Treatment Phase (Day 1, 2 and 3)  
 
EXP -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 17 of 87  
  
During the treatment phase, trial visits will be performed on Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3. 
The individual transparent film(s) will be used to locate the TAs.  
LSR scores for the TAs will be recorded and any new or on -going AEs, and changes in 
medication will be recorded.  
 
Criteria for treatment on Day 2 and Day 3 : 
 
• The subject not reporting intolerable response to  treatment.  
• The (sub)investigator not evaluating LSRs or treatment -related AEs to be  unacceptable.  
• The LSR scores not exceeding predefined criteria (see  Table  1). 
 
Table 1. LSR score criteria for not administering second or third treatment.  
 
LSR component(s)  Score on Day 2 and/or 3  
Erosion/ulceration  ≥2 
Vesiculation/pustulation  ≥3 
Any LSR component  =4 
Flaking/scaling + crusting  ≥5 (sum)  
Flaking/scaling + crusting + vesiculation/pustulation  ≥6 (sum)  
 
 
The reason not to treat is recorded in the eCRF. Subjects will remain in the trial and attend the 
follow -up visits according to the protocol.  
The IPs are to be applied to the TAs by [CONTACT_472111] (Visit 2, 3 and 4). Subjects will be carefully instructed in how long the 
IP must remain on the skin and how it can be washed off. Moreov er, the subjects will be 
reminded about the precautions regarding accidental transfer of the IP to eyes and other areas 
(refer to section 10.3.2 ). 
 
Post-treatment assessment (Day 2, 3, 4 and 8)  
 
If the subject is not treated on Day [ADDRESS_605178] a site visit, while subjects in cohort 4 will be 
contact[CONTACT_472112] (i.e. subjective evaluation) , AEs and 
concomitant medication. Should the subjects in cohort 4 express worsening o f LSR or

treatment area for further treatment or assessments of the treated skin.  
 
The following clinical assessments must be ma de at visits as specified in section 8.1: 
 
1. IGA of the full face (see Table 4 for grading) at Screening to determine acne  vulgaris 
severity for inclusion to the trial at  Screening.  
2. IGA and non -inflammatory lesion count (open and closed comedones), and 
inflammatory lesion count ( erythematous papules and pustules) in TA left and TA right at 
Screening and Day 1, Week 2, 4, 8, and  12. 
3. LSR assessments (see 8.13) in TA left and TA right using the LSR Grading Scale at Day 1 
prior to IP application, and on all subsequent site  visits.  
4. Skin photography at Day 1, prior to treatment, and on all subsequent site visits (only 
for cohort 1, 2, and  3). 
5. Skin photography at screening for cohort 3 and  4 
6. All other skin findings than LSRs and acne will be reported as medical history at 
Screening or as AEs at subsequent  visits.  
7. Biomarker and microbiome samplings in Cohort 2, 3 and 4 at Day 1 and at Week 2, 4,

• Classification of adverse events in terms of severity, causality and outcome are defined in  
Appendix [ADDRESS_605208] will be asked a non -leading question by [CONTACT_941] (sub)investigator about 
AEs, for example: “How have you felt since I saw you last?”. No specific symptoms should 
be asked for. It is important that the (sub)investigator als o observes the subject for any 
changes not reported by [CONTACT_73319].  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_605209] be added to the AE form and in addition be reported to 
LEO on the SAE Form (according to “Investigator Reporting Responsibilities”, section 9.4.1 ) 
 
Any treatment for a LSR must be recorded on the concomitant medication page of the eCRF 
with the most important LSR (e.g. swelling should be reported as swelling -LSR).  
 
9.[ADDRESS_605210] or observed by [CONTACT_941] (sub)investigator must be recorded on the 
adverse event form of the eCRF and should be described in the following manner:  
 
The AE term will be in precise English medical terminology (i.e. not necessarily the exact 
words used by [CONTACT_423]) . Whenever possible, a specific diagnosis should be stated (e.g. 
allergic contact [CONTACT_8748]).  
 
For AEs, the location must be part of the adverse event description and may be described as 
“in the treatment areas”, “outside the treatment areas” or “not appl icable”. For adverse events 
in treatment areas the lateral side needs to be specified also.  
 
The duration of the AE must be reported as the start date and stop date of the event. In 
addition, it must be recorded whether the AE started prior to start of trial medication.  
 
AEs must be classified in terms of severity, causality and outcome according to the defini tions 
in Appendix 8 . 
 
9.2.1 Actions Taken as a Consequence of an  AE 
Action taken with trial treatment: Any action taken with trial medication as a consequence of 
the AE must be recorded (dose not changed, dose reduced, dose increas ed, drug interrupted, 
drug withdrawn, not applicable, unknown).  
 
Other action taken: Any other action taken as a result of the AE must be recorded (none, 
concomitant medication, concurrent procedure).  
 
Withdrawn due to AE: It must be recorded whether the A E leads to withdrawal from the trial.

errors fall into four categories: wrong medication, wrong dose (including strength, form, 
concentration, amount), wrong route of administration or wrong subject.  
 
The medication error must be documented on the adverse event form of the eCRF book. In 
addition, AEs originating from a medication error must be documented on a separate line

Any clinically significant aggravation/exacerbation/worsening of any medical condition(s), 
compared to baseline, must be reported as an AE.  
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_605217] for adverse events regarding development of keratoacanthoma (KA) 
or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Moreover, KA can be difficult to distinguish clinically 
and histologically from SCC . Sun -damaged skin is also prone to development of KA as a 
response to local irritation and/or inflammation. The subjects in this trial are not expected to 
have sun -damaged skin due to younger age and are thus considered to have a very low risk of 
developi [INVESTIGATOR_472084].  
 
To ensure that all information relevant for surveillance is collected, SCCs and KAs in the 
treatment area are considered adverse events of special interest (AESI).  
 
For SCCs and KAs in the treatment area, the relevant information will be col lected in the 
eCRF. In addition, histology report should be faxed or emailed to Global Pharmacovigilance, 
once available, using the following fax number or email address:  
 
Fax number: [PHONE_1914]  
 
Email address: drug.safety@leo -pharma.com  
 
SCCs and KAs in the treatment area that meet the criteria for being serious should be reported 
as SAEs (please refer to section 9.4.1 for reporting details).  
 
The pathology slides that have been used for the initi al diagnosis of SCC or KA will be sent 
for central pathology review. Central pathology reports will be distributed to the investigator. 
If there are any discrepancies between the local pathology report and the central pathology 
report, there should not be any changes in the eCRF. For the central pathology review, the 
local pathology laboratory will send the relevant histology slides to the investigator who will 
forward the slides to the pathologist doing the central reading. Only if the original slides 
cann ot be sent is it acceptable to use new slides made from the tissue block.

Route of administration  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_472087] (TA left and TA right ) 
corresponding to approximately 36 cm2 each.  
Application frequency  Once daily for up to three consecutive days  
Daily maximum  Approximately 1/3 of a tube per TA applied by [CONTACT_472114] a thin wet layer.  
Time of day for application  No specific requirements  
Relation of time of application to dietary intake  No specific requirements  
 
The IP will be applied to the treatment areas at the clinic by [CONTACT_310623] .  
 
10.2.1  Trial Medication  Application  
At each application, a thin wet layer of trial medication should be applied evenly within the 
identified TA of approximately 36 cm2 by [CONTACT_941] t rial site staff. The required total amount of IP 
to produce a thin wet layer is approximately 1/[ADDRESS_605223] amount of IP. Prior to application, 
the location of the TA is identified using a transparent film and a three -point landmark 
technique ( Appendix 10 ). 
 
Trial medication should be applied according to the following procedure:  
 
1. Using standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472088], remove the cap from the unit dose tube. Squeeze a 
pea-sized drop of IP from tube onto the index  finger.  
 
EXP -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 39 of 87  
  
2. Spread the trial medication evenly over the assigned treatment areas such that a thin 
wet layer of IP  is applied.  
3. Recap the tube and store for drug account (refer to section  10.7). 
4. Dispose of gloves and wash hands with soap and  water.  
5. Allow the trial medication to dry for at least 15 minutes following  application.  
 
General t reatment guidance:  
 
• Subjects should not shave or trim the treatment areas during the treatment  days.  
• Subjects should not wash the treatment areas on the treatment days prior to IP 
application.  
• Subjects must avoid washing the treatment areas or engaging in activities that cause 
excessive sweating for at least 6 hours following IP  application.  
• When subjects resume their normal washing routine, they should wash the treatment 
areas gently using a mild  soap.  
• Subjects should avoid use of non -medicated/non -irritant salves/emollients on the 
treatment areas during treatment days and within [ADDRESS_605224] treatment 
day. 
• Subjects should avoid use of make -up and sunscreens on the treatment areas from [ADDRESS_605225] IP application. Note: Eye -make - 
up within peri -orbital area and lipstick is  allowed.  
• Subjects should be advised not to allow other persons (including children) and pets to 
come into contact [CONTACT_472115] a period of 6 hours following 
application.  
• Subjects should avoid contact [CONTACT_472116].  
• Subjects should avoid excessive sun exposure (e.g. sunbathing, tanning booths) of the 
treated  area.  
 
10.3 Precautions/Over  dosage  
10.3.[ADDRESS_605226] common LSRs reported in the AK studies with LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel are erythema, 
flaking/scaling, and crusting. Less common LSRs include swelling/oedema, 
vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ ulceration. Completed clinical trials have shown LSRs 
to be tra nsient and normally resolved within two weeks (please refer to the Investigator's 
Brochure of LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel in Actinic Keratosis Edition 4 or any updates hereof for further 
details).

The mean maximum composite LSR score in Part 2 of LP0084 -1013 (face) for the doses of 
LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel that will be used in the  current trial was 8.9 for face. Using the same doses for 
3 consecutive days (LP0084 -1148), mean maximum composite scores were 10.6 for face.  
Peak value in the LP0084 -1013 trial (face) was at Day 3. At Day 15, mean maximum 
composite LSR score was either at  baseline value or close to baseline value in almost all 
subjects treated on face (refer to the Investigator's Brochure of [ZIP_CODE] gel in Actinic Keratosis 
Edition 4 or any updates hereof).  
 
Investigators conducting clinical trials with LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel should ensure that investigational 
site staff is trained in the protocol -specified application procedure(s) and follow appropriate 
precautions. Investigators must monitor their subjects for the emergence and resolution of 
LSRs and AEs  
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_605228] should immediately seek medical attention by [CONTACT_472117] (e.g., in an Emergency 
Room) for assessment and treatment. All treatments are to be administered at the discretion of 
the healthcare professional (in emergency room, ophthalmologist, and/or the investigator).  
Treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_472089]. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_900] -inflammatory agents and eye pads may also be useful for subject comfort. The 
subject should be monitored closely in the first few days following exposure to check for 
secondary infection and to assess visual acuity. Subjects shoul d be warned that vision might 
worsen before improvement occurs.  
 
Any suspected ocular exposure should be documented and brought to the attention of the 
monitor

11 Statistical  Methods  
11.1 Determination of Sample  Size 
With a sample size of 38 subjects the power of observing a difference between active and 
vehicle gel will be 84% in a trial with intrain dividual comparisons, using a paired two -sided t - 
test on a 5% level, assuming an approximate total lesion count of 36 at baseline and 
reductions at end of trial from baseline around 7.3 (20%) and 12.4 (34%) for vehicle gel and 
active respectively, and a s tandard deviation of the difference between treatments at end of 
treatment up to  10.4.  
 
The assumptions on sample size are that all but the two first subjects of the 40 subjects 
randomised are included in the efficacy analyses, and the assumptions on effic acy rely on 
experiences from a previous trial conducted by [CONTACT_472120] -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 43 of 87  
  
(LP0045 -01), together with an expected reduction in standard deviation of the primary 
endpoint of at least 20% due to the intraindivi dual comparisons.  
 
11.2 Definition of Trial Analysis  Sets 
All subjects enrolled in the trial (i.e. subjects for whom informed consent has been obtained 
and who have been registered in the clinical trial) will be accounted for in the clinical trial 
report.  
 
All subjects randomised except the first two subjects with a reduced exposure are included in 
the full analysis set and will be analysed for efficacy. The size of the full analysis set will then 
be [ADDRESS_605234] and/or for whom no post -baseline 
safety evaluations are available.  
 
The decisions regarding inclusion/exclusion of subjects and/o r subject data from the trial 
analysis sets will be documented in the statistical analysis plan update before breaking the 
randomisation code.

11.3.11  General  Principles  
All significance tests will be two -sided using the 5% significance level. All confidence 
intervals will be presented with 95% degree of confidence.  
 
An observed cases approach will be used for tabulations of data by [CONTACT_765] (i.e. involving only 
those subjects who attended each specific visit).  
 
Categorical data will be summarised using the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category. Continuous da ta will be summarised using the mean, median, standard deviation 
(SD), minimum and maximum values.  
 
Any changes from the statistical analysis planned in this clinical trial protocol will be 
described and justified in a protocol amendment or the statistical  analysis plan update and/or 
in the clinical trial report dependent on the type of deviation.  
 
11.3.12  Handling of Missing  Values  
Subjects with missing counts of inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesions at visits 7, 8 and 
9 (weeks 2, 4 and 8) will be excluded fro m the analyses based on FAS and PP for these time 
points, and missing lesion counts will therefore not be imputed for these subjects. For subjects 
with missing lesion counts at visit 10 (week 12), the missing lesion counts of visit 10 will be 
imputed and t he endpoints will be derived afterwards from the imputed values.  
 
A multiple imputation method will be used to handle missing data. The imputation method 
relies on the assumption that the missing data are missing at random (MAR), i.e. the 
probability that an observation is missing can depend on observed data but is unrelated to the 
data not observed. All imputations will be performed by [CONTACT_472133].  
 
Imputation of missing values for subjects with a monotone missing data pattern (i.e. the re 
exist a time point for the subject where all observations before the time point are present and 
all later observations are missing) will be based on the full observed dataset excluding 
subjects with a non -monotone missing data pattern. The missing value s for lesion counts at 
visit 10 will be imputed sequentially from a linear regression model with lesion counts at 
previous visits as covariates and treatment compliance (as identified by [CONTACT_472134]) as factor.  
 
EXP -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 49 of 87  
  
For subjects with a non -monotone missing data pattern, the lesion counts at visit 10 will be 
imputed using data from subjects without a non -monotone missing data pattern based on the 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method including compliance effect, and l esion counts 
at previous visits 7, [ADDRESS_605238] non -negative integer.  
 
Table 5 sh ows seed and numbers of imputations used for the multiple imputations

• Document decision i n the meeting  minutes.  
 
EXP -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 50 of 87  
  
• Convene to review safety and tolerability after the last subject in cohort 1, 2 and 3 has 
completed the Week 2 follow -up visit (Visit  7). 
• Decide whether quality of data is sufficient and whether unacceptable LSRs, safety  or 
tolerability events have occurred necessitating termination of the clinical  trial. 
Prior to dosing of the first subject, the Safety Review Committee Charter will be final ised 
detailing the evaluation procedure and processes for immediate communication between sites.  
 
Unacceptable LSR scores, safety and tolerability events:  
 
Unacceptable safety and tolerability events in an individual subject are defined as 1) clinically 
relevant signs or symptoms observed, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_472091] 2) one or more of the following LSRs:  
 
• Grade 4  crusti ng 
• Grade 4 erosion /  ulceration  
• Grade 4 vesiculation / pustulation extending significantly outside the treatment area 
Or two or more of the  following:  
• Grade 4  erythema  
• Grade 3 crusting  
• Grade 4 swelling extending significantly outside the treatment  area 
• Grade 3 erosion /  ulceration  
• Grade 3 vesiculation /  pustulation  
 
Criteria for terminating the trial : 
 
The trial will be terminated if the perception of the benefit/risk ratio (judged from clinical 
symptoms, signs and/or (S)AEs) becomes unfavorable for the continuation of the trial.  
 
• Any decision regarding premature termination of the entire trial will be m ade after mutual 
agreement between the Investigator and the  sponsor.  
• The sponsor reserves the right to cancel the trial at any  time 
• Due to the design of the trial, there are no statistical criteria for trial  termination.  
• The cumulative frequencies of subjects with unacceptable LSRs, safety and tolerability 
events (as defined above ) that will strongly support the decision for trial termination  are:

13 Electronic Case Report Forms and Data  Handling  
13.1 Electronic Case Report Forms  (eCRFs)  
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_82081] (EDC). The investigator or staff 
authorised by [CONTACT_82082]. Dat a recorded in 
the electronic CRFs must be accessible to site staff through a secure internet connection 
immediately after entry. The eCRFs must be maintained in an up -to-date condition at all 
times.  
 
The investigator must electronically sign all CRFs used.  This signature [CONTACT_3031] (including 
date of signature) will be kept in the audit trail and cannot be altered. Any correction(s) made 
by [CONTACT_472136]. Cha nges to data, already approved, will require the re -signature [CONTACT_94212]. The person making the change and the date, time and reason for the change will 
be identified in the audit trail.  
 
For archiving purposes, each investigator must be supplied with a copy of the eCRFs for all 
subjects enrolled at the trial site via an electronic medium at completion of the trial and before 
access to the eCRF is revoked. Audit trail information must be included. eCRFs must be 
available for inspection by [CONTACT_472137] d representatives from LEO (e.g. audit by [CONTACT_82085]), from regulatory authorities and/or IEC/IRBs.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_605239]’s medical record or other 
defined document normally used at the trial site. Source data not norm ally collected as a 
routine part of the clinical practice at the site may be entered on a worksheet. Clinical 
assessments/safety evaluations must be signed by [CONTACT_82086] (sub)investigators.  
 
• If the worksheet does not become part of the subject’s medical record, the following 
should as a minimum be added to the subject’s medical  record:  
• Date(s) of conducting the informed consent process (date of enrolment) including date of 
provision of subject  information  
• Subject  ID 
• Randomisation code number (if  applicable)  
• The fact that the subject is participating in a clinical trial in acne including treatment arms 
of LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel and vehicle gel once daily for up to three consecutive  days 
• Other relevant medical  information  
13.[ADDRESS_605240] 
Visit (FSFV) and no later than 4 weeks after.  
 
The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the trial site’s recruitment rate, the compliance 
of the trial site with the protocol and GCP.  
 
In order to perform their role effectively, monitors and persons involved in quality assurance 
and inspections will need direct access  to source data, e.g. medical records, laboratory reports, 
appointment books, etc. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the 
investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition, relevant  
 
EXP -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 53 of 87  
  
site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring 
visits (e.g. by t elephone).  
 
14 Handling of an Urgent Safety  Measure  
An Urgent Safety Measure is a measure taken to implement an action/protocol deviation 
under an emergency. This is defined within the EU Directive as “…the occurrence of any new 
event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal 
product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the 
investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to pr otect the subjects against any 
immediate hazard. ” (Article 10(b) of Directive 2001/20/EC).  
 
If the investigator becomes aware of information that necessitates an immediate change in the 
clinical trial procedure or a temporary halt to the clinical trial in order to protect clinical trial 
subjects from any immediate hazard to their health and safety, the investigator can do so 
without prior approval from LEO, regulatory authority(ies) or IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
 
The investigator must immediately inform LEO - by [CONTACT_472138] - 
of this change in the clinical trial procedure or of the temporary halt providing full details of 
the information and the decision making process leading to the implementation of the urgent 
safety measure.  
 
LEO must act im mediately upon receipt of the urgent safety measure notification in 
accordance with the internal procedures.  
 
15 Quality  Assurance/Audit  
The clinical trial will be subject to audits conducted by [CONTACT_472139]/IECs. Audits and inspections may take place 
during or after the trial. The investigator and the site staff as well as LEO staff have an 
obligation to cooperate and assist in audits and inspections. This includes giving auditors and 
inspecto rs direct access to all source documents and other documents at the trial site relevant 
to the clinical trial. This includes permission to examine, verify and reproduce any records 
and reports that are important to the evaluation of the trial.  
 
If the trial site is contact[CONTACT_73350], LEO must be notified 
immediately.  
 
EXP -[ADDRESS_605241] undertake arrangements for the collection 
and disposal of any unused tr ial material that the investigator is not required to keep in his/her 
files.  
 
16.1.1  Criteria for Premature Termination of the Trial and/or Trial  Site 
LEO, the investigator, the IRB/IECs or competent authorities may decide to stop the trial, part 
of the trial or a trial site at any time, but agreement on procedures to be followed must be 
obtained.  
 
If a trial is suspended or prematurely terminated, the investigator must inform the subjects 
promptly and ensure appropriate therapy and follow -up. As specified by [CONTACT_472140], the investigator or LEO must promptly inform IRB/IECs and provide a detailed 
written explanation. Relevant competent authorities must be informed.  
 
The trial must be terminated if the perception of the benefit/risk ratio (ju dged from clinical 
signs and symptoms, (S)AEs and/or remarkable safety laboratory changes) becomes 
unfavorable for the continuation of the trial.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_605242] Care Following Trial  Completion  
After the completion of the trial, the subjects will be treated at the investigator’s discretion or 
referred to other physician(s) according to standard practice.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_605243] make arrangements to s tore the essential trial docu - 
ments including the Investigator Trial File (ICH E6, Guideline for Good Clinical Practice) 
until LEO informs the investigator that the documents are no longer to be retained or longer if 
required by [CONTACT_427].  
 
In add ition, the investigator is responsible for the archiving of all relevant source documents 
so that the trial data can be compared against source data after the completion of the trial (e.g. 
in case of an inspection from regulatory authorities).  
 
EXP -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 55 of 87  
  
The investigator is required to ensure the continued storage of the documents even if the 
investigator leaves the clinic/practice or retires before the end of the required storage period.  
 
The destruction process must ensure confidentia lity of data and must be done in accordance 
with local regulatory requirements.

26 Appendix 2: Tape lifting procedure and biomarker  analyses  
Tape lifting procedure:  
 
Skin contents will be collected from the subjects as described in 8.1Schedule of Trial  
Procedures for inflammatory marker analysis, using D -squame Strippi[INVESTIGATOR_472099] (CuDerm, 
Dallas, TX). Apply the tape strip to the treatment area, smooth side down, pressing down to 
ensure good contact [CONTACT_37381]. Slowly and carefully peel off starting at edges, pulling toward 
center and place the strip immediately in an Eppendorf tube for storage until analysis. For 
further details refer to the Lab Manual.  
 
Biomarker analyses  
 
Expression of inflammatory mediators such as, but not limited to, IL -1, IL -6, IL -8, IL -10 and 
TNF -α will be analyzed from tape strips sampled from the treatment areas. We hypothesize 
that treatment with ingenol mebutate may modulate the levels of pro -inflammatory mediators, 
including IL -1, TNF -α and IL -8. Recently, a non -invasive method of detecting changes in 
cytokine expression in skin has been demonstrated ( 19). Using a similar technique, we will 
compare the changes in expr ession of inflammatory mediators before and after topi[INVESTIGATOR_472100] [ZIP_CODE] gel or vehicle gel as one of the exploratory endpoints. Skin samples 
will be collected using a tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_472101] a psoriasis trial 
(20). Samples will be used to isolate RNA and mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators 
will be determined by [CONTACT_5203] -time PCR using the Fluidigm Platform at AROS Applied 
Biotechnology A/S, Denmark For details, see Lab  Manual.

31.[ADDRESS_605257] a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can the refore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether 
or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. ( ICH Harmonized Tripartite 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, E6 (R1)).  
 
This definition includes:  
 
• accidental injuries, events related to trial procedures, reasons for any unfavourable and 
unplanned change in medication (drug and/or dose), clinically si gnificant worsening of 
pre-existing conditions, or reasons for admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472103]. It also includes AEs commonly observed and AEs 
anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the in vestigational product. In addition, 
any laboratory abnormality assessed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_941] (sub)investigator must 
be recorded as an  AE. 
31.2 Serious Adverse Event  Definition  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that  
 
• results in  death  
• is life-threatening  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]. Planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472104]’s medical  record.  
• results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
or 
 
EXP -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 74 of 87  
  
• is a medically important condition. Events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73250]. Ex amples 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic broncospasm, blood 
dyscrasias and convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], development of drug 
dependency or drug  abuse.

32 Appendix 8: Classification of Adverse  Events  
32.1 Severity  
The severity of the AE should be described in terms of mild, moderate or severe according to 
the (sub)investigator’s clinical judgement.  
 
Mild  An adverse event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere 
with usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate  An adverse event that is usually alleviated with addition al specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily 
living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm 
to the subject.  
Severe  An adverse event that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or 
significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive  therapeutic 
intervention.  
If the severity of an AE worsens, a new AE should be recorded.  
 
EXP -[ADDRESS_605258] should be described in 
terms of probable, possible or not related according to the following:  
 
Probably 
related  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
invest igational product.  
 
Could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455].  
 
Follows a known pattern of response to the investigational product.  
 
Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the 
investigational product.  
 
Reappears or worsens upon re -challenge.  
Possibly 
related  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the 
investigational product.  
 
Could also be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455].  
 
Follows a known pattern of response to the investigational product.  
Not related  Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
investigational product.  
 
Is better explained by [CONTACT_73343]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455].  
 
Does not reappear or worsen upon re -challenge.  
 
Does not follow a known pattern of response to the investigational product.  
 
EXP -1223  15-Sep-2016  Page 77 of 87  
  
32.3 Outcome  
The outcome of the event should be classified and handled as follows:  
 
Recovered/ 
resolved  The event has stopped. The stop date of the event must be recorded.  
Recovering/ 
resolving  The subject is clearly recovering from an event. The event is not yet 
completely resolved.  
Not 
recovered/ 
not resolved  Event is still ongoing.  
Recovered 
with 
sequelae  The event has reached a state where no further changes are expected and the 
residual symptoms are assumed to persist. An example is hemiparesis after 
stroke.  
 
The stop date of the event must be recorded. In case of a SAE, the sequel ae 
should be specified.  
Fatal  The subject has died as a consequence of the event. Date of death is recorded 
as stop date for the AE.  
Unknown  Unknown to (sub)investigator, e.g. subject lost to follow -up.

Identifying and Documenting the Treatment Area  
 
On each cheek of enrolled subjects representative areas of approximately 36 cm2 (6cm ×6 cm) 
are selected as treatment areas by [CONTACT_093].  
 
These TAs area will be documented using a ‘3 -point landmark technique’ on the study 
transparencies.  
 
Instructions are provided below. Transparencies and markers will be provided to the trial sites. 
Three point landmark technique for each study transparency:  
1. Complete information on the transparency usin g a permanent  marker.  
2. Place the transparency over the treatment area and cut a hole for the  nose.  
3. Map and label at least 3 anatomical landmarks on the transparency which are in the 
vicinity of the treatment area. These landmarks should not change during the trial (e.g., 
scars, moles, birthmarks, bony landmarks,  etc.) 
4. Mark the outline of the treatment a rea on the provided  transparency.  
5. Use the transparency to re -locate the treatment area for subsequent trial visits. When 
realigning the transparency, use the documented anatomical landmarks to accurately 
duplicate transparency  placement.  
6. Retain the transpa rency as part of the subject’s source  documents.

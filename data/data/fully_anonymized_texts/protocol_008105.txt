transplant follow-up. 
Purpose and 
rationaleThe large majority of the published clinical experience with treatment of TMA with 
complement blockade has been performed in a single center (Cincinnati), where the 
biology and treatment of TMA is a key research focus. In this protocol we seek to 
establish a treatment regimen that can be generalizable to multiple sites and does not 
require time-intensive individual PK and PD monitoring. In preparation for this study, 
we established prospective screening for TMA, determined high-risk disease markers, 
and performed eculizumab detailed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) 
studies in children receiving HCT. We will perform the current study at multiple centers 
to establish exportability; the regimen is expected to provide satisfactory outcomes for 
a large majority of children without highly specialized monitoring.
Hypotheses 1.  Early intervention with complement blocker eculizumab will double survival in 
HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583185], as compared to historical untreated controls.  
2.  An optimal eculizumab dosing schedule can be determined for this population 
through eculizumab pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) testing. 
Primary 
endpoint Survival at [ADDRESS_766684] the null hypothesis of 18% survival versus 
a projected increase in survival to 45% at [ADDRESS_766685]. The sample size of 21 has a 
greater than 80% power of yielding a significant p-value. The primary analysis will be 
intent-to-treat. A secondary “successfully treated patient analysis” (defined as >4 doses 
of eculizumab administered) will also be performed using a non-relapse mortality 
endpoint. Children who receive 4 or fewer doses of therapy, or who relapse with 
malignancy prior to 24 weeks on the study will be replaced.
Secondary 
endpointsCumulative incidence of organ dysfunction at [ADDRESS_766686], compared with historical controls with high risk TMA 
using MODS definition is shown in APPENDIX II. Organ systems evaluated 
will be:
oRenal 
Includes hypertension evaluation

Study design This is prospective single arm multi-institution study in patients undergoing allogeneic 
(alloHCT) or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHCT). We will 
enroll [ADDRESS_766687] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (plus replacements if needed for early death due 
to inability to receive a minimal level of therapy, or relapse; see statistical section for 
details) diagnosed with high risk TMA using our published criteria (Jodele et al, Blood 
2014). The eculizumab dosing regimen for this study was derived from our clinical and 
PK/PD data in [ADDRESS_766688] five weeks of 
therapy. This allows rapid disease control, which is essential to avoid organ injury. 
Maintenance dosing will continue until all patients complete a total of 24 weeks of 
therapy (Table 1). Survival will be assessed at [ADDRESS_766689], it is 
important to avoid undertreatment of these patients in order to improve chances of 
preventing MODS and death. This dosing regimen should be feasible at institutions that 
don’t have the availability to monitor drug PK/PD in real time. PK/PD testing obtained 
during this study will allow us further optimize the eculizumab dosing schedule and to 
determine patients in whom shorter therapy might be possible. All study patients will 
receive antimicrobial prophylaxis adequate to cover N. Meningitides for the duration 
of the eculizumab therapy plus until the CH50 and eculizumab serum level is 
unmeasurable (<25 µg/ml), when complement should no longer be blocked. 
Eculizumab PK/PD studies will be performed on all study patients and will be used for 
secondary endpoints. After the primary study endpoint is met, patients will be treated 
and monitored as clinically indicated, with final follow-up at [ADDRESS_766690] with:
Histologic TMA diagnosis 
OR clinical TMA diagnosis and presenting with high risk disease features 
including:
elevated plasma sC5b-9 above laboratory normal value (≥244ng/ml). 
AND
proteinuria: measured as ≥30mg/dL of protein on random urinalysis 
x2 or protein/creatinine ratio ≥1mg/mg or patient receiving renal 
replacement therapy.
             TMA diagnostic criteria are shown in APPENDIX I
Minimum weight of ≥ 5kg.
ADAMTS13 Activity lab sample must be drawn during or prior to screening 
(results can be pending and are not required for initial eligibility).  
Development of TMA can be a medical emergency and thus if patient meets 
all other eligibility criteria, patient may proceed with enrollment and study 
treatment even if ADAMTS13 results are not available. If test results confirm 
diagnosis of TTP defined by [CONTACT_439903]13 activity test <10%, then study 
treatment will be immediately halted and patient will be removed from study.
Exclusion 
criteriaKnown hypersensitivity to any constituent of the study medication.
Subjects with unresolved serious Neisseria meningitides infection or 
Progressive severe infection.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Purpose and rationale of the study
Thrombotic microangiopathy or transplant associated atypi[INVESTIGATOR_151258] (aHUS) is an 
important cause of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death after HCT (further in the protocol 
referred as “TMA”). The large majority of the published clinical experience with treatment of TMA with 
complement blocking agent eculizumab has been performed at a single center (Cincinnati), where the 
biology and treatment of TMA is a key research focus. In this protocol we seek to establish a treatment 
regimen that can be generalizable to multiple sites and does not require time-intensive individual 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) monitoring.  In preparation for this study, we established 
prospective screening for TMA, determined high-risk disease markers, and performed detailed eculizumab 
PK/PD studies in children receiving HCT. We will perform the current study at multiple centers to establish 
exportability; with that established, the approach should be able to be adopted more broadly. The regimen 
is expected to provide satisfactory outcomes for a large majority of children without highly specialized 
monitoring. Due to the high mortality observed among patients with high-risk TMA who don’t receive 
targeted anti-complement therapy, a randomized study including untreated control arm is not considered to 
be ethically feasible.
1.2 Significance of the study in relation to human health
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is an 
understudied complication of HCT that significantly affects transplant related morbidity and mortality. 
Over the past several decades, the cause of TMA was unknown, limiting treatment options to non-specific 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_583186]. Our recent prospective studies dedicated to the study of TMA have 
provided new insights into the pathogenesis of, and genetic susceptibility to TMA, raising awareness of this 
important transplant complication and allowing for the identification of novel therapeutic targets. 
Specifically, many patients with TMA develop multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to tissue 
injury through endothelial damage mediated by [CONTACT_583233]. This knowledge has 
led to complement blockade using eculizumab as a therapy directly targeting the cause of the disease. This 
new strategy has the potential to favorably influence clinical practice and change the standard of care for 
how HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583187]. Preliminary data and experience to date suggest that early 
TMA therapy will reduce incidence of MODS after HCT and improve long-term outcomes in transplant 
survivors. The data this study will generate will have importance beyond the field of stem cell 
transplantation in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_583188].
1.3 Background
TMA occurs in 30% of children undergoing HCT, and about half of these children develop MODS that is 
generally lethal if not treated early. TMA affects the endothelium of small vessels, leading to MODS 

CCHMC IRB#: 2018-7119C
      
Page 9 of 43presenting as renal failure, pulmonary hypertension with cardiac failure, polyserositis, and bowel ischemia 
and necrosis. Retrospective literature consistently reports over 80% mortality with TMA/MODS, with the 
large majority of patients dying within [ADDRESS_766692] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. In our earlier study, we showed 9% 
overall survival in patients with high risk TMA and MODS who did not receive TMA targeted therapy with 
82% of patients dying by [CONTACT_5875] 24 after TMA diagnosis (Jodele et al, Blood 2014).[ADDRESS_766693] to this, in a single center prospective study we showed that eculizumab therapy given for TMA and 
MODS improved survival to 62% compared to 9% (p=0.0007) in patients with same risk TMA not receiving 
eculizumab (Jodele et al, BBMT [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE] ). We have extended this experience using complement 
blockade for TMA/MODS, having treated more than 50 patients, optimizing therapy through 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) testing. Our experience and publications indicate that the 
main reason for failure in treating TMA after HCT is late initiation of eculizumab intervention. Once 
TMA/MODS is advanced, severely impaired organ function can’t be salvaged. In our clinical cohort, 
patients were started on eculizumab therapy on average 43 days from TMA diagnosis; those at end stages 
of their disease more often having poor outcome. Our data to date also indicate that eculizumab 
pharmacokinetics in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583189] (aHUS)(Jodele et al, BBMT 2015).[ADDRESS_766694] patients through PK/PD based eculizumab dosing.  
There is a significant need for a prospective, multicenter study that examines eculizumab efficacy in TMA 
after HCT in consistent manner, initiating therapy early in patients at high risk for TMA associated MODS. 
Because of the high mortality observed among patients with high-risk disease who did not receive targeted 
anti-complement therapy, a randomized study with untreated control group is not considered to be ethically 
feasible. Also, we have demonstrated that the HCT population has a much more severe TMA phenotype 
and much higher eculizumab clearance than reported in patients with aHUS and PNH,7,[ADDRESS_766695] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583190] 39% (39/100) of children undergoing 
HCT and identified TMA risk criteria. HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583191] ≥30 mg/dL and 
elevated sC5b-[ADDRESS_766696]-transplant survival (<20%, high risk patients). 
Patients with TMA, but without proteinuria and without elevated sC5b-9, all survived without targeted 
intervention (low risk group). Having one risk factor, proteinuria or elevated sC5b-[ADDRESS_766697] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583192] 34% (mild to severe phenotype). Severe TMA phenotype TMA 
with MODS occurred in 11% of all transplanted patients. All these patients had evidence of terminal 
complement activation and required therapy with eculizumab. 
We also showed that pediatric intensive care unit (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]) admissions for MODS were much higher in 
children with TMA as compared  to those without TMA (46% vs 15%, p=0.01)(Jodele et al Blood 2015).9 
Overall non-relapse mortality in children with TMA and MODS was over 90% without TMA targeted 

CCHMC IRB#: 2018-7119C
      
Page 10 of 43therapy. The historical rate from our prospective study had survival documented in 2/11 (18%) patients 
with high risk TMA with MODS without relapse who did not receive any targeted TMA therapy within [ADDRESS_766698]. Similar rates are consistently reported in retrospective studies showing over 80% non-relapse 
mortality (NRM) with TMA and MODS with patients dying within 6 months of TMA diagnosis.2,3,10-12 Cho 
et al reported 29% incidence of TMA (n=148) 
with <20% survival in patient meeting 
hematologic and renal diagnostic criteria 
(“definite TMA”), and concluded that TMA 
should be treated as soon as it is suspected, to 
avoid irreversible organ damage since therapeutic 
interventions like plasma exchange, defibrotide or 
discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors had the 
greatest benefit if therapy was initiated early, but 
there are no clinical trials evaluating any TMA 
targeted treatment methods. Oran et al reported 55 
of 66 patients (83%) dying at a median of [ADDRESS_766699] TMA epi[INVESTIGATOR_583193]-
responders to plasmapheresis was 1.07 months vs 
7.5 months in responders (p=0.0001). Survival at 
6 months was 0% and 50.7% for TMA non-
responders and responders to plasmapheresis, 
respectively. 
Genetic predisposition to TMA after HCT: We 
performed a hypothesis-driven analysis of 17 
candidate genes known to play a role in 
complement activation as part of a prospective 
study (n=100) of TMA in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. We 
examined the functional significance of gene 
variants by [CONTACT_583234]. 
Sixty-five percent of patients with TMA had 
genetic variants in at least one gene compared 
with 9% of patients without TMA (p < 0.0001) 
(Fig.1). Gene variants were increased in patients of all races with TMA, but nonwhites had more variants 
than whites (2.5 [range, 0-7] vs 0 [range, 0-2]; p <0.0001). Variants in ≥3 genes were identified only in 
nonwhites with TMA and were associated with high mortality (71%). RNA sequencing analysis of pre-
transplantation samples showed upregulation of multiple complement pathways in patients with TMA who 
had gene variants, including variants predicted as possibly benign by [CONTACT_183560], compared with 
those without TMA and without gene variants.  
Kidney injury: Consistent with our previous studies, we observed that proteinuria and hypertension were 
the earliest signs of TMA in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], along with an elevation in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). 
In contrast, kidney dysfunction assessed by [CONTACT_583235] a late marker, highlighting its limitations 
as it remains an insensitive marker to detect impaired renal function in pediatric HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583194].4 In a prospective 94 patient cohort 
we showed that pediatric equations including Cystatin C (Cyst C) performed better than those including 
only creatinine,[ADDRESS_766700] adopted Cystatin C based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) monitoring 
of acute kidney injury (AKI) for children undergoing HCT. In the group of 30 children treated with 
eculizumab for high risk TMA in Cincinnati, the median decline in CycC GFR due to TMA was 75% from 
pre-transplant baseline, indicating severe kidney injury occurs with the microangiopathic process. Thirty 
six percent of these patients progressed to ≥ stage [ADDRESS_766701] patients without TMA are 4 times more likely to develop 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and [ADDRESS_766702] hypertension with kidney function declining 
to as low as 40% of normal [ADDRESS_766703].14,15 

CCHMC IRB#: 2018-7119C
      
Page 11 of 43Cardiac and pulmonary injury: We showed in autopsy specimens that HCT-TMA can be associated with 
significant pulmonary vascular injury. This presents clinically as hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_583195] (PH). Of note, echocardiography can identify vascular injury associated with TMA 
as early as [ADDRESS_766704].16 In our prospective TMA study (n=100) pulmonary hypertension was 
diagnosed exclusively in the TMA group, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_583196] (p<0.01).4 A separate prospective cardiac screening study of 227 patients at our 
institution supported our initial observations, confirming that clinically significant pericardial effusions 
were associated with TMA (p<0.01).
 
Gastrointestinal (GI) injury: In our prospective study severe gastrointestinal bleeding occurred only in 
subjects with TMA; notably only those who received TMA targeted therapy survived.4 Patients with 
intestinal TMA presenting as ischemic colitis who were treated with eculizumab sometimes had intestinal 
strictures requiring surgical resection. A retrospective blinded review of pathology samples we performed 
showed that histologic evidence of TMA can be identified in the bowel of subjects with systemic high risk 
TMA features.17
Blood stream infections (BSI): In a 
prospective analysis of [ADDRESS_766705] at our institution to 
determine the incidence, risk factors, and 
outcomes of patients that developed a 
bloodstream infection (BSI) we showed that 
nearly 50% of all patients with a BSI 
developed sepsis, 25% were transferred to the 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890], and 10% died within 10 days of the 
positive culture. One-year non-relapse 
mortality (NRM) was significantly increased 
in patients with one BSI (34%) and more than 
one BSI (56%) in the first year post-HCT 
compared with those who did not develop 
BSIs (14%) (p ≤ 0.0001). TMA was 
significantly associated with development of 
a BSI in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (OR, 2.94; p < 0 
.0001) likely due to impaired intestinal 
vascular barriers due to microangiopathy.  
TMA risk stratification
Our prospective monitoring study showed 
that children with both proteinuria 
(≥30mg/dL) and terminal complement activation as measured by [CONTACT_583236]5b-9 level 
(>244ng/mL) in addition to hematologic TMA markers (elevated LDH, de novo anemia and 
thrombocytopenia, low haptoglobin and schistocytes) at TMA diagnosis had very poor a 1-year HCT 
survival (<20%), whereas subjects without complement activation (normal plasma sC5b-9) and no 
proteinuria all survived without any interventions (20% vs 100%, p<0.0006).[ADDRESS_766706] elevated sC5b-9 and proteinuria now are stratified 
as “high risk TMA” due to high risk for MODS and death and are offered eculizumab therapy, those with 
normal sC5b-9 and no proteinuria are “low risk TMA” and are closely monitored without interventions.

As we were studying complement blocking therapy in HCT patients with high-risk TMA, we discovered 
that eculizumab pharmacokinetics in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583197] (aHUS and PNH). We measured eculizumab serum concentrations, total hemolytic complement 
activity (CH50), and plasma sC5b-[ADDRESS_766707] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583198]-risk TMA presenting 
with complement activation. Population PK/PD analyses correlated eculizumab concentrations with 
complement blockade and clinical response and determined inter individual differences in PK parameters. 
Our first cohort included [ADDRESS_766708] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583199].5 Two critically 
ill patients died before ever achieving therapeutic drug levels. Eculizumab and total complement activity 
(CH50) levels that were measured at the same time points strongly correlated with each other. Specifically, 
a CH50 level of <10% normal corresponded with an eculizumab concentration >100 mg/mL, considered to 
be the therapeutic target concentration for complete complement blockade. Subsequently, 12 patients were 
treated using PK/PD dose guided regimen.6 In the PK analysis, we found significant interpatient variability 
in eculizumab clearance, ranging from 16 to 237 mL/hr/70 kg in the induction phase. The degree of 
complement activation measured by [CONTACT_583238]5b-9 concentrations at the start of therapy, in addition to actual body 
weight, was a significant determinant of eculizumab clearance and disease response. 
All subjects with elevated sC5b-9 above normal (>244ng/mL) cleared eculizumab below therapeutic of 
100µg/mL in less than [ADDRESS_766709] 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583200]. The clearance progressively declined as the disease was controlled and became 
similar to what is reported in aHUS after the 5th week of therapy. Drug trough levels ≥100µg/mL were 
required to sustain TMA control in maintenance therapy. We validated a more frequent early-dosing 
algorithm in another 11 patients. We also showed that therapeutic eculizumab serum concentrations of 
≥100µg/mL correlated well with total complement activity (CH50) suppression below detectable, <10% of 
normal lab value allowing us to use CH50 as accurate marker for eculizumab dose adjustments. In a 
publication of first 30 treated patients, we reported that 64% of patients had complete resolution of TMA 
and were able to safely discontinue eculizumab without disease recurrence. Overall survival was 
significantly higher in treated subjects compared with untreated patients (62% versus 9%, p =0.0007).[ADDRESS_766710] treated 50 patients with severe TMA using eculizumab therapy at CCHMC with an overall 
survival of 72% (36 survivors, 14 non-survivors). Median treatment time was 10 weeks (range 2-32, 
including survivors and non-survivors). Out of 50 Eculizumab treated patients 94.3% of responders were 
free of TMA with less than or equal to [ADDRESS_766711] eculizumab dose (mg). 
This algorithm was used to develop the dosing schedule for this study.

to 48.5). Study subjects received a median of 14 eculizumab doses (range, 2 to 38 doses) for HCT-associated 
TMA therapy. There were no epi[INVESTIGATOR_583203]. The incidences of bacterial and fungal 
bloodstream infections were similar in patients treated with eculizumab (n=30) as compared with those 
with HSCT-associated TMA who did not receive any complement blocking therapy (n=39). Our data 
indicate that terminal complement blockade in the early post-transplant period can be performed without

(CHLA), Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP), and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI)/[LOCATION_011] 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BCH), all large pediatric transplant centers (~400 transplant/year combined). All 
patients are prospectively monitored for TMA after starting HCT as part of clinical care. Patients with high 
risk TMA2 will be enrolled on this study after meeting eligibility criteria. The eculizumab dosing regimen 
for this study was derived from our clinical and PK/PD data in [ADDRESS_766714] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583185], avoiding 
under treatment that allows ongoing organ damage.  Loading doses are given ≤72h intervals based on ultra-
high clearance during the first 2 weeks of therapy until sC5b-9 normalizes. Induction doses are given 
weekly to sustain therapeutic eculizumab trough level of ≥100µg/mL, since eculizumab clearance in HCT 
patients remains much higher than in aHUS during first [ADDRESS_766715] 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583204], since eculizumab clearance is similar in both 
populations when complement activation is controlled. All patients will receive total of 24 weeks of therapy 
before eculizumab is stopped and patients continue close clinical monitoring (Table 1). Survival will be 
assessed at 6 months from TMA diagnosis as the primary study endpoint. We hypothesize that this dosing 
regimen should be feasible at institutions that don’t have availability of monitoring drug PK/PD in real 
time. PK/PD data obtained during this study will be used to further optimize eculizumab dosing schedule 
and to determine patients in whom shorter therapy might be safe. All study patients will receive 
antimicrobial prophylaxis adequate to cover N. Meningitides while complement is blocked (refer to Section 
6.1).

This study will be conducted at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (CCHMC), Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7723] 
(CHLA), Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP), and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI)/[LOCATION_011] 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BCH) in patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant and have a diagnosis of TMA with high risk disease features.  
2.5 Recruitment
The study will enroll 21 consecutive patients with high risk TMA (see statistics section for details). [CONTACT_583255] or one of the other Bone Marrow Transplant Physicians who are co-investigators at CCHMC or 
investigators at participating sites will consult with the patient and/or the parent/legal guardian to explain 
the procedures, risks and benefits of the study at the patient/parent’s level of understanding. Opportunity 
will be given to consider the study and have questions answered. Information will be given in a written 
format in the form of a description of the study, which will include a signature [CONTACT_583254]. Participation is voluntary, and all subjects/parents/guardians will give informed consent to 
participate. 
2.6 Expected duration of the study
Expected study duration is 4 years: we anticipate enrolling 7-[ADDRESS_766718] the date of TMA diagnosis.  
In our 100 patient prospective observational study, overall TMA incidence was 39% (39/100) with 11 of 
these 39 patients having high risk TMA with MODS (Jodele et al, Blood 2014). The historical survival rate 
for these patients with high risk TMA with MODS from our prospective study who did not receive any 
TMA targeted therapy was 2/11 (18%) children alive 24 weeks from TMA diagnosis and overall survival 
of 9% (1/11) at [ADDRESS_766719]. Similar rates are consistently reported in retrospective studies from others 
showing <20% survival with TMA and MODS with patients dying within 6 months of TMA diagnosis. 
3.2 Secondary study endpoints
Cumulative incidence of organ dysfunction at [ADDRESS_766720], compared with historical controls with high risk TMA using MODS definition is shown in 
APPENDIX II. Organ systems evaluated will be:
oRenal

Histologic TMA diagnosis 
OR clinical TMA diagnosis and presenting with high risk disease features including:
oelevated plasma sC5b-9 above laboratory normal value (≥244ng/ml). 
AND
oproteinuria: measured as ≥30mg/dL of protein on random urinalysis x2 or 
protein/creatinine ratio ≥1mg/mg or patient receiving renal replacement therapy.
             TMA diagnostic criteria are shown in APPENDIX I.  
Minimum weight of ≥ 5kg.
ADAMTS13 Activity lab sample must be drawn during or prior to screening (results can be 
pending and are not required for initial eligibility).  Development of TMA can be a medical 
emergency and thus if patient meets all other eligibility criteria, patient may proceed with 
enrollment and study treatment even if ADAMTS13 results are not available.  If test results 
confirm diagnosis of TTP defined by [CONTACT_439903]13 activity test <10%, then study treatment will 
be immediately halted and patient will be removed from study.
4.2 Exclusion Criteria
Known hypersensitivity to any constituent of the study medication.
Subjects with unresolved serious Neisseria meningitides infection or
Progressive severe infection.
Patients previously treated with eculizumab or other complement blocker for TMA within the [ADDRESS_766723] dose of study treatment.
5. STUDY DRUG
5.1 Eculizumab availability for study
Eculizumab (Soliris) will be provided by [CONTACT_583241]. 
5.2 Eculizumab mechanism of action
Eculizumab, the active ingredient in Soliris, (Alexion Pharmaceuticals) is a monoclonal antibody that 
specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby [CONTACT_29638] C5a 
and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Eculizumab inhibits 
terminal complement mediated intravascular hemolysis in patients with PNH and blocks complement-
mediated TMA in patients with aHUS. It has received regulatory approval in multiple countries for these 
two diseases. At CCHMC eculizumab has been used in [ADDRESS_766724] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583206]/PD based 
dosing regimen and was shown to be safe in HCT population when antimicrobial prophylaxis is provided 
for the duration of complement blockade (Jodele et al, BBMT 2015).6

6. TREATMENT PLAN
6.[ADDRESS_766725] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583200]
Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are recommended 
to be treated as early as possible with eculizumab.
Healthcare professionals who prescribe eculizumab (Soliris) must enroll in the Soliris REMS 
program. 
Vaccination of study subjects with meningococcal vaccine according to current ACIP guidelines 
will be considered if immune response to vaccine is expected based on timing after-HCT. 
Decision to vaccinate study subjects will be based on the primary treating physician’s assessment. 

CCHMC IRB#: 2018-7119C
      
Page 18 of 43All study subjects will be counseled for risk of meningococcal infection due to terminal 
complement blockade.
Beginning with the first dose of eculizumab, all study subjects will be started on antimicrobial 
prophylaxis using an agent with activity against Neisseria meningitides, if not already receiving 
systemic antibiotics providing adequate coverage.
oRecommended agents for patients not receiving broad spectrum antibiotics for other 
clinical reasons that would cover N. meningitis:
Tier 1: Age/weight based therapeutic dosing of ciprofloxacin (PO and IV).
Tier 2: Age/weight based therapeutic dosing of oral amoxicillin.
If local strains of N. meningitis bacteria are resistant to either of these antibiotics 
or the patient is allergic or cannot otherwise tolerate the standard prophylactic 
treatment, the choice of antibiotic will be made upon local guidelines or the 
recommendation of the local Infectious Disease (ID) consultant.
Antibiotic prophylaxis will be continued until eculizumab clearance is documented (serum drug 
concentration <25 µg/ml) and CH50 recovery to normal or above normal levels (based on 
performing laboratory value) is documented.
Eculizumab will be stored and dispensed by [CONTACT_583242] (Soliris USPI [CONTACT_243551] 2016 NH).
Eculizumab will be administered as intravenous infusion (IV) over 60 minutes using dosing 
schedule outlined in Table 1. 
No pre-medications are required, but may be given based on the primary treating physician’s 
decision.
If an adverse reaction occurs during the administration of eculizumab, the infusion may be 
slowed or stopped at the discretion of the study investigator and institute any appropriate 
measures. If the infusion is slowed, the total infusion time should not exceed four hours. The 
adverse reaction must be recorded. 
Patients may remain on current immunosuppressive therapy, including steroids.
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) should NOT be used during 
eculizumab therapy, unless there is a strong clinical indication that may affect patient safety. 
Study subjects who require FFP or TPE for clinical indications will require supplemental doses of 
eculizumab as listed in Table 2. 
Patients may receive fibrinogen, albumin and IVIG and other monoclonal antibodies as clinically 
indicated without restrictions.

CCHMC IRB#: 2018-7119C
      
Page [ADDRESS_766727] the number of doses listed in Table 1 or dose (mg) and dosing 
intervals may be modified if deemed by [CONTACT_583243] 
(for example in patients with intestinal bleeding). Dose modification must be discussed with the Lead PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_583208]. 
Eculizumab therapy may be shortened to less than [ADDRESS_766728] to the patient under the 
following conditions:
where TMA is adequately controlled or resolved and additional eculizumab doses will not 
be of benefit, 
or if continuation of eculizumab would interfere with other clinical interventions deemed 
more essential for patient’s wellbeing.
This does not include study drug discontinuation for safety reasons or therapy intolerance.  These patients 
will remain on study and should complete assessments as per Early Termination visit at the time of 
discontinuation of eculizumab.  Refer to the Schedule of Assessments Table for the list of required 
assessments.  Additionally, V37 (Day 180) and V38 (Day [ADDRESS_766729]-transplant) visits should be complete 
according to original protocol schedule.  
If eculizumab was held because of other therapeutic interventions and there is no clinical concern for active 
TMA, then eculizumab can be resumed at the dosing regimen used prior to holding/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478].
In the event eculizumab is held/stopped early according to the above criteria and the patient has a 
reactivation or progression of TMA, eculizumab study treatment may be resumed at a more intensified 
dosing regimen. The dosing regimen to be resumed should be discussed with the Lead PI. 
6.2.2 Supplemental eculizumab dosing for patients receiving FFP and TPE
Study subjects requiring fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) will receive 
supplemental eculizumab dosing as listed in Table 2.  Subjects receiving FFP or TPE will continue to 
have study assessments performed as per the Schedule of Assessment table.  Eculizumab serum 
concentration (drug level) and CH50 should be performed prior to each supplement eculizumab dose if 
clinically feasible, for at least first 5 FFP/TPE sessions to assure that drug supplementation is adequate. 
Research Biomarker Panel is not required before supplement eculizumab doses. 
 
   
  
  
6.2.3 Patient monitoring during eculizumab therapy
Laboratory monitoring is summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Dose changes will NOT be made in real time

bTMA Test Panel includes CFH autoantibody, plasma sC5b-9 and eculizumab pharmacokinetic panel (eculizumab serum concentration, CH50) and is to be 
performed at CCHMC, as feasible. (Refer to Appendix III for link for test requisition and additional information.) For patients requiring eculizumab serum 
level and CH50 on the same day, testing for both may be ordered as Eculizumab Pharmacokinetic Panel on the CCHMC Test Requisition and performed from 
the same blood sample (1 mL blood in serum tube).  Blood may be collected during routine draws.  On days of eculizumab administration, the eculizumab 
serum concentration sample is to be collected PRIOR to administration of eculizumab, preferably within 90 minutes before eculizumab infusion.    Among 
patients receiving plasma exchange/plasma infusion (PE/PI), dialysis or transfusion, blood will be collected prior to initiation of PE/PI, dialysis or transfusion, 
as feasible.  Eculizumab pharmacokinetic panel (eculizumab serum concentration and CH50) should be performed prior to each supplement eculizumab dose if 
clinically feasible, for at least first 5 FFP/TPE sessions to assure that drug supplementation is adequate. Additional blood samples may be collected at 
scheduled clinical visits or unscheduled visits, at the discretion of the Treating Physician and/or Principal Investigator.  Following discontinuation of

#  During Maintenance phase, study assessments will be performed at a minimum of every 2 weeks, a maximum of every week. Study visit windows during   
   Maintenance phase will be +/- 48 hours for study infusions, eculizumab serum concentration, CH50, and research biomarker panel to accommodate patient   
   scheduling.  All other labs can be collected the same day or any day within the same week of the scheduled study visit. 
* If a patient completes all the Study Visits (Visits 1-38), Visit 38, the last Study Visit, will be the end-of-study (EOS) visit, at which time the patient completes 
the study. 
&If a patient withdraws early from the study, prior to completing Visit 36, an Early Termination (ET) Visit will be performed within one week of 
withdrawal (see Table 4). Any assessments not performed within 7 days of ET visit will need to be completed – any assessments performed within 7 days do 
not need to be repeated or recollected.  
+Unscheduled visits and procedures will be performed at the Investigator’s discretion and results will be recorded on the CRF.
○  Obtain only at Visit 36 or Early Termination Visit if abnormal prior to starting therapy.
§  EOS/Day 365 study visit is to be performed approximately one year, ± [ADDRESS_766735] Panel includes CFH autoantibody, plasma sC5b-9 and eculizumab pharmacokinetic panel (eculizumab serum concentration, CH50) and is to be 
performed at CCHMC, as feasible. (Refer to Appendix III for link for test requisition and additional information.) For patients requiring eculizumab serum 
level and CH50 on the same day, testing for both may be ordered as Eculizumab Pharmacokinetic Panel on the CCHMC Test Requisition and performed from 
the same blood sample (1 mL blood in serum tube). Blood may be collected during any routine draws before eculizumab administration.  On days of 
eculizumab administration, the eculizumab serum concentration sample is to be collected PRIOR to administration of eculizumab, preferably within 90 
minutes before eculizumab infusion. Among patients receiving plasma exchange/plasma infusion (PE/PI), dialysis or transfusion, blood will be collected prior 
to initiation of PE/PI, dialysis or transfusion, as feasible. Eculizumab pharmacokinetic panel (eculizumab serum concentration and CH50) should be performed 
prior to each supplement eculizumab dose if clinically feasible, for at least first 5 FFP/TPE sessions to assure that drug supplementation is adequate. Additional 
blood samples may be collected at scheduled clinical visits or unscheduled visits, at the discretion of the Treating Physician and/or Principal Investigator. 
Following discontinuation of eculizumab treatment, eculizumab serum concentration and CH50 will be monitored weekly until normalized or above 
normal as per protocol section 6.2.4.
b Eculizumab will be administered by [CONTACT_12781] 60 minutes according to the dosing information on Table 1. For patients receiving PE/PI, supplemental 
eculizumab doses should be administered according to Table 2. If supplemental eculizumab doses are given on a day in which eculizumab is not scheduled to

CH50 will be monitored weekly until normalized or above normal as per protocol section 6.2.4.
c Research Biomarker Panel: plasma and serum samples for measures as outlined in the research laboratory manual will be collected for shipment to an Alexion 
designated laboratory. (Refer to lab manual for biomarker collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_22026].) Among patients receiving PE/PI, dialysis or transfusion, blood 
will be collected prior to initiation of PE/PI, dialysis or transfusion, as feasible. On days when eculizumab is administered, blood samples should be collected 
prior to administration of eculizumab, preferably within 90 minutes before eculizumab administration.  Research Biomarker panel samples are not required 
before supplemental eculizumab doses.  
d Safety assessments (i.e., vital signs, physical examinations) will be performed as per SOC. Weight and height (height for baseline may be pre-transplant value) 
   will be collected for all patients at Screening and at the end of study.  Use vital signs collected at the start of day shift, i.e., at approximately 8 AM.
e AEs will be collected for 60 days (5 half-lives) after the last eculizumab infusion and all SAEs will be collected (see protocol section 8.3 for additional details).  
fOther laboratory tests will include, but are not limited to full panel blood chemistry, serum creatinine, cystatin C GFR, haptoglobin, urinalysis and random 
urine protein creatinine ratio, as per institutional SOC.   
g Clinical assessments of renal, cardiac, gastrointestinal, pulmonary and neurological signs and symptoms will be assessed as part of SOC, approximately once a 
week using the MODS form in Appendix II. MODS Assessments must be completed for [ADDRESS_766736] dose of eculizumab.

Weekly CH50 levels will be checked until they return to normal or above normal values (see normal 
CH50 values for performing laboratory) to document that patients have recovered from 
complement suppression.
Weekly serum eculizumab serum concentration will be checked until it is documented to be below 
measurable (<25 µg/mL) to document that drug is completely cleared from the blood. 
Weekly sC5b-9 will be monitored until normalization of CH50 levels (levels may also be above 
normal) and eculizumab drug clearance is documented (eculizumab serum concentration is <25 
µg/mL) to assure that terminal complement does not get activated again after the eculizumab is 
cleared, then as clinically indicated.
Anti-meningococcal prophylaxis will continue until the CH50 level is normal and eculizumab 
serum concentration is unmeasurable (<25 µg/mL). 
MODS assessments are to be completed weekly through [ADDRESS_766741] eculizumab 
infusion, either weekly as inpatient or if outpatient, then with each clinic visit, but not more than 
once a week.
Patients are to be monitored for adverse events through [ADDRESS_766742] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (section 1.4).18 Because of the risk of 
meningococcal infections (black box warning), eculizumab is available only through a restricted program 
under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the Soliris REMS, all eculizumab 
prescribers will be enrolled in the REMS program.
7.[ADDRESS_766743] occurred in patients with aHUS treated with 
eculizumab and may be fatal if not recognized and treated early. The Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices (ACIP) recommends meningococcal vaccination in patients with complement deficiencies. It is 
recommended that patients are immunized with a meningococcal vaccine at least [ADDRESS_766744] dose of eculizumab, unless the risks of delaying eculizumab therapy outweigh the 
risks of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a meningococcal infection. Patients on this trial will not be able to respond to vaccine, 
and will instead receive antimicrobial prophylaxis (section 7.3). Patients should be monitored for early 
signs of meningococcal infections, and evaluated immediately if infection is suspected. For this reason,

(REMS). Under the eculizumab (Soliris) REMS, prescribers must enroll in the program. 
7.[ADDRESS_766745] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583202]-risk TMA without meningococcal vaccine. All patients received 
antimicrobial prophylaxis adequate for Neisseria meningitides during eculizumab therapy and for 8 weeks 
after discontinuation of the drug. Median time to TMA diagnosis was 28 days after transplant (range, 13.8 
to 48.5). Study subjects received a median of 14 eculizumab doses (range, 2 to 38 doses) for HCT-associated 
TMA therapy. There were no epi[INVESTIGATOR_583203]. The incidences of bacterial and fungal 
bloodstream infections were similar in patients treated with eculizumab as compared with those with HCT-
associated TMA who did not receive any complement blocking therapy. There were no other clinically 
significant side effects attributed to eculizumab. Our data indicate that terminal complement blockade in 
the early post-transplant period can be safely performed without meningococcal vaccination while using 
appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis until complement function is restored after therapy completion 
(section 1.4).
All study subjects will be counseled regarding risk of meningococcal infection due to terminal 
complement blockade.
All study subjects will be started on antimicrobial prophylaxis using an agent with activity against 
Neisseria meningitides if not already receiving systemic antibiotics providing adequate coverage 
beginning with the first dose of eculizumab (refer to Section 6.1). 
Anti-meningococcal prophylaxis will continue until the CH50 level is normal and the eculizumab 
serum concentration is unmeasurable (<25 µg/mL). 
7.4 Risk to an unborn fetus
While eculizumab had been used in pregnant women with preeclampsia, PNH, and aHUS, this drug is 
listed as Category C (not enough research has been done to determine if these drugs are safe). 
8. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
8.1 Study monitoring and auditing
Monitoring and auditing procedures will be followed to ensure that the study is conducted, documented, 
and reported in accordance with the IRB approved protocol, all applicable federal regulations and 
guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements at participating institutions. 
Verification of eligibility will be performed and appropriate documentation of informed consent will be 
documented for all subjects enrolled into the study. The timeliness of Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event reporting will be monitored to ensure regulatory compliance. All case report forms (CRF) for the 
first subject enrolled into the study will be monitored for completeness and quality by [CONTACT_583244]. Thereafter, a minimum of 10% of enrolled subjects’ 
CRFs will be monitored for completeness and quality by [CONTACT_583245].
The extent of monitoring activities will be subject to change based on enrollment, the degree of risk or 
significance of monitoring findings, and other study management issues.

comprised of qualified physicians, not associated with this protocol. The DSMB will meet with the Lead 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_583212]/progress a minimum of approximately every 6 months or more 
often at the discretion of the Lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or DSMB.
The DSMB will be notified immediately and will review all unanticipated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others, unanticipated serious adverse events and all subject deaths associated with the protocol 
and provide an unbiased written report of the review. Based on the review of these events, the DSMB should 
make a recommendation regarding study continuation.
8.3 Adverse events (AE)
8.3.[ADDRESS_766748] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related.
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, 
and does not imply any judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., 
off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or 
dose, including an overdose.
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
A serious adverse event is an undesirable experience that results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
A life-threatening adverse event 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583213]: 
oNon-life-threatening hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583214], initiation or adjustments of care of transplant-associated 
complications, diagnostic evaluations, or social reasons. 
oNon-life-threatening hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583215]’ primary medical condition, therapy targeting primary medical condition, or for 
initiation or adjustments of care associated with primary condition management, 
diagnostic evaluations or social reasons. 
oHospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a planned diagnostic workup/procedure/disease treatment.
oAdmission for known complications of TMA will be recorded on the MODS assessments 
and not upgraded to a serious adverse event solely on the basis of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions

intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above 
Note: Events that may not meet criteria as serious should be reviewed and captured as a non-
serious adverse event according to the requirements for reporting AEs (see section 8.3.2).
Attribution to the study drug:
Unrelated: The AE is clearly NOT related to the intervention
Unlikely: The AE is doubtfully related to the intervention
Possible: The AE may be related to the intervention
Probable: The AE is likely related to the intervention
Definite: The AE is clearly related to the intervention
Expected and Unexpected Event:
Expected: Any experience previously reported (in nature, severity, or incidence) in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure or as specified in the protocol.
Unexpected: Any experience not previously reported (in nature, severity, or incidence) in the 
current Investigator’s Brochure or as specified in the protocol.
8.3.2 Adverse event reporting
Safety and tolerability for the study drug will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events v5.0 (CTCAE published November 27, 2017). The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_583216]’s relationship to study procedures to 
determine whether the event is unrelated or, unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely related to the study 
procedures, especially in relation to the underlying disease and baseline lab values for the patient.
All expected and unexpected Grade [ADDRESS_766749] been previously identified as resulting from administration of the 
protocol therapy, those that can be attributed to the underlying condition, and/or those associated with 
transplant. An adverse event is considered unexpected, for reporting purposes only, when either the type of 
event or the severity of the event is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, consent and/or protocol.
Additionally for this study, events previously identified as resulting from administration of a stem cell 
transplant procedure will be considered as expected. The transplant regimen is well known to commonly 
affect multiple systems such as the hematologic, immunologic and, pulmonary, gastrointestinal systems. 
The following are known complications of transplant- graft failure, graft versus host disease, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, febrile neutropenia, viral, bacterial and fungal infections, hemolysis, septic 
shock, thrombotic microangiopathy, veno-occlusive disease of liver, adrenal insufficiency, diarrhea, 
enterocolitis, gastrointestinal pain and bleeding, malabsorption, mucositis, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting, 
dyspepsia, fever, pain, cholecystitis, allergic reaction, serum sickness, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], urinary

urgency, irregular menstruation, pruritis, hypertension, purpura, and petechiae, polyserositis, seizures, 
multi-organ failure, death.

CCHMC IRB#: 2018-7119C
      
Page 31 of 43Hematologic toxicities of any grade which are attributable to the underlying hematological disease and/or 
HCT preparative regimen will not be considered adverse events. In the event that any of these known 
complications of transplant or hematologic toxicities are thought to be at least possibly attributable 
to the study drug, the event will be recorded and subsequently reported to the IRB and FDA 
according to current reporting requirements, as outlined in the preceding paragraphs.
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they 
worsen after starting study drug. This excludes TMA since disease progression is anticipated in some 
patients after initiation of complement blocking therapy and TMA is the subject of this study. Please refer 
to APPENDIX V for AE reporting requirements for TMA associated conditions. Abnormal laboratory 
values or test results constitute adverse events only if they are outside expected laboratory abnormalities 
seen during HCT process, induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require 
therapy as determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_583217]. 
Each site will be responsible for reporting all SAEs to their IRB according to institutional guidelines, current 
regulations and applicable federal regulations. All SAEs will be reported to the Lead PI/Sponsor or designee 
via fax or e-mail within 2 business days of the site principal investigator’s knowledge of the SAE.
If any serious adverse events occur, current guidelines will be followed for expedited reporting to the IRB, 
DSMB, and FDA.  
All serious and medically significant adverse events considered related to eculizumab by [CONTACT_583246].  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting Guidelines for External Site 
Any SAE must be reported to CCHMC as soon as possible but no later than 2 business days of the site 
principal investigator’s knowledge of the SAE. The SAE report (CRF) along with applicable source

Page 32 of 439. RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS
This study will be more than minimal risk but with potential for direct benefit to participants. 
9.1 Potential benefits
Prevention of or treatment resulting in better outcomes after TMA associated multi-organ dysfunction 
syndrome (MODS) is a potential direct benefit of the study.
9.2 Potential risks, discomforts, and inconveniencies 
Risk associated with study therapy:  There are risks to the patients which include acute allergic reaction to 
the drug and increased risk of meningococcal meningitis. There are single case reports of meningococcal 
meningitis with long-term use of eculizumab in patients who received meningococcal vaccine. We have 
reported that eculizumab was safe to use in HSCT patients who are unable to receive vaccines but are on 
antibiotics prophylaxis for the duration on complement blockade by [CONTACT_151305], there were no cases of 
meningococcal infection in the HCT patients treated with eculizumab at CCHMC.
Potential risks, discomforts, inconveniences, and precautions with study blood draws: Any research 
samples will be obtained in accordance with institutional standards to ensure patient safety and without 
compromising needed diagnostic/clinical blood samples or patient health.  The total amount of blood drawn 
will not exceed 5% of the estimated blood volume in any 24 hour period.  The total volume of blood in any 
24 hour period will include blood drawn for clinical testing, research and waste samples combined. Blood 
will be drawn through patients’ existing central lines whenever possible.  Peripheral needle sticks will only 
be required in the event of no central access. Since patients undergoing HCT have daily laboratory studies 
performed as routine clinical care, additional study-related tests will be added-on to already collected blood 
samples whenever possible. Extra blood would only be drawn if specific collection tubes are required. 
Whenever possible, study blood samples will be obtained at the same time as routine blood draws to 
eliminate or minimize additional central line access. Urine will be collected by [CONTACT_583247]. 
However, if a catheter is inserted for clinical indications, urine from the Foley bag will be obtained.
10. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical Analysis for primary endpoints
This prospective single arm study will test the null hypothesis of 18% survival against an alternative of 
increasing survival to 45% at 24 weeks from TMA diagnosis, resulting in a 2.5 times increase in survival 
rate in patients (18% vs. 45%) in this high risk population by [CONTACT_583248]. The 
level of significance will be set to 0.05. The primary endpoint will be assessed using a [ADDRESS_766750]. The sample size of 21 has a greater than 80% power of yielding a significant p-
value. The primary analysis will be based upon intent-to-treat. A secondary “successfully treated patient 
analysis” (defined as > 4 doses of eculizumab administered) will also be performed using a non-relapse 
mortality endpoint, including all children receiving >4 doses of therapy. Children who receive 4 or fewer 
doses of therapy, or who relapse with malignancy prior to 24 weeks on the study will be replaced. This is 
based on preliminary data showing that it takes 11-13 days to control complement activation with 
therapeutic eculizumab trough level (≥100µg/mL) in patients with severe TMA before clinical response 
can be anticipated. (Jodele et al, BBMT 2016).
Statistical analysis for secondary endpoints will be descriptive. Eculizumab PK/PD analyses and modeling 
will be performed as previously published by [CONTACT_27156] (Jodele et al, BBMT 2015).6 Interim analysis of 
eculizumab PK/PD study will be performed after the first 5 subjects complete the loading and induction

2. Completed registration case report form (CRF)
3. Completed eligibility checklist and relevant de-identified source documents 
Eligibility documents will be reviewed by [CONTACT_95702]/Sponsor or designee. Once eligibility has been 
established, the patient will be assigned a unique study ID number. This number is unique to the patient 
and must be written on all data forms and correspondence for the patient. The study ID number will be 
relayed to the site via email and will serve as the enrollment confirmation. 
12. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PARTICIPATING CENTERS
Prior to opening the study at each center, the Lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_583218] a 
teleconference to orient and train local PIs and research coordinators on study procedures related to data 
collection and patient monitoring. When the study is open and enrolling at other centers, the Lead PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Sponsor will conduct regularly scheduled calls with the PI/designee and/or study coordinator/nurse 
from each site. Patient eligibility, subject enrollment, study status and patient safety will be discussed 
during each call, as applicable.
13. DATA MANAGEMENT

Page 40 of 4320. APPENDIX IV: STUDY SAMPLE COLLECTION FOR REPOSITORY
Research samples as described below will be collected from study participants who are not currently 
enrolled onto the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) Tissue Repository (CCHMC Study #: 2012-
1156) or a similar repository study at participating sites. Blood samples collected from the tissue repository 
will include testing to assess the immunogenicity of eculizumab.
Peripheral blood [including plasma, serum and nucleated cells (MNCs or PBMC)],  and urine samples will 
be collected weekly through [ADDRESS_766759]-transplant (blood twice weekly), approximately monthly for the 
first year or at follow-up visits, or during scheduled clinical visits, if less often, till the first year after 
transplant, and at the time of any transplant complications. Stool samples will be collected weekly as 
feasible at the site PI’s discretion. Other tissue samples (like tissues from clinically obtained biopsies or 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_128905]) will be collected as available. If a pre-transplant DNA sample is available, 
it may be requested for a TMA-associated genetic panel. 
These samples will be processed, frozen, and stored at the site where they were collected. Then samples 
will be shipped in batches to CCHMC. These samples may be used in current and future research studies.
Procedures
1) Peripheral Blood Draw*
Patients undergoing a peripheral blood draw will undergo venipuncture after an appropriate site 
has been identified and cleaned per standard procedure. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_583226]. A central line would be used in patients who 
have this access. 
*Blood volumes will be based on patient weight and estimated blood volume. No more than 5 
ml/kg of the patient’s body weight will be taken for both clinically indicated and research purposes 
(per standard transplant practice). The first priority will be clinically indicated volumes. 
2) Urine
Urine is to be collected, stored and shipped in batches to CCHMC. 
3) Stool
Stool will be collected as per institutional standard of practice. 
4) Leftover Clinical Samples
Blood, tissue and body fluids that are leftover after clinical testing (peripheral blood, urine, stool, 
bone marrow, tumor specimens, immortalized B-cell lines, oral specimens, DNA), that would 
otherwise be discarded, may be stored. 
5) Database
Access to study database will be limited to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_583227]. Each specimen collected will be entered into the specimen 
database, along with all information collected.
6) Release of Specimens to Investigators
Release of any specimen to investigators must be approved by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_126985]. The procedures for release of specimens are described below.
a. CCHMC investigators
In order for a CCHMC investigator to receive specimens and/or data, the following must 
be submitted to CCHMC study staff: 
1) Completed application 

CCHMC IRB#: 2018-7119C
      
Page 41 of 432) Documentation of CCHMC IRB approval (IRB #) for the proposed research 
project if the use of the samples and/or data released from the repository 
constitutes human subjects research per 45 CFR 46 or genetic research.
Upon receipt of the above application and approval by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_126985], the specimen(s) will be released to the CCHMC investigator. 
b. External investigators
As this will become a valuable resource for potential research, it is anticipated that it will 
serve as a tissue repository for investigators at other centers. The external investigators can 
apply for de-identified specimens alone, and/or de- identified patient clinical information. 
No identifying information will be released to external investigators at any point.
In order for an investigator at another center to receive any data or specimens, the following 
must be submitted to CCHMC study staff: 
1) Completed application
2) Local IRB or Ethics Committee (country specific IRB equivalent) approval 
document if the use of the samples and/or data released from the repository 
constitutes human subjects research per 45 CFR 46 or genetic research. (If this 
document is in a language other than English, it must be translated and verified 
by a CCHMC employee fluent in that language. This can be a member of the 
CCHMC interpreter team).
Upon receipt of the above documents and approval by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_126985], the specimen(s) will be shipped to the external investigator. 
Special considerations:
Genetic studies: There is potential for genetic studies involving these specimens, including, but not 
limited to complement genes and other genetic pathways possibly implicated in TMA or organ 
dysfunction after HCT. 
Other Repositories: Additional samples may be collected from other repositories, if available, in 
special circumstances (i.e. in the event pre-transplant samples are needed for genetic testing).

Page 42 of 4321. APPENDIX V: ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING OF TMA ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS
TMA associated conditions that will not be reportable as AEs
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they 
worsen after starting study drug. This excludes TMA since disease progression is anticipated in some 
patients after initiation of complement blocking therapy and TMA is the subject of this study.
Below is a list of conditions/symptoms that are considered part of TMA for which sites would not have to 
report as AEs if they worsen after start of eculizumab (i.e., are considered worsening or progressive 
TMA). Conditions/symptoms, that in and of themselves would be considered serious, as per the criteria in 
section 8.3.1, will need to be reported immediately as SAEs.
Please contact [CONTACT_583253].

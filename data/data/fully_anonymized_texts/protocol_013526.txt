ABSTRACT  
 
Relapsed/refractory pediatric solid and CNS tumors are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric 
oncology with few effective treatment options. Both preclinical and clinical studies involving pediatric solid 
and CNS tumors have shown an aberration of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. In 
addition, these studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the mTOR pathway has significant efficacy impeding growth of these tumors. ABI -009, also known as nab- Rapamycin, is a novel human albumin-bound 
preparation of rapamycin, a potent mTOR inhibitor. Albumin nanoparticle technology encapsulates lipophilic 
drugs into nanoparticles by [CONTACT_527308] a water -based solvent under high 
pressure. This technology enha nces permeability and retention (EPR), allowing accumulation of 
macromolecules in solid tumors. In the adult phase [ADDRESS_684439] a phase 1 trial of ABI -009 in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide in children with 
recurrent solid and CNS tumors using the Rolling Six design. The aims of the trial will be to establish the 
maximum tolerated pedia tric dose of ABI -009, and to investigate the toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics of ABI-009 in children with these tumors.

2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_684440] 
ABI-009, also known as nab-Rapamycin, is a novel human albumin- bound preparation 
of rapamycin, a potent mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. Rapamycin 
interacts with the 12 kDa FK506- binding protein (FKBP12) and forms a gain-of-
function complex, resulting in inhibition of mTOR function.[ADDRESS_684441] occurs in numerous adult and pediatric cancers as a result of gain-of- function 
mutations in oncogenes and/or loss -of-function mutations in tumor suppressors.[ADDRESS_684442] is not only confined to cancer, but also observed in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegeneration.

mTOR, a serine/threonine protein kinase, belongs to the phosphoinositide 3- kinase 
(PI3K) -related protein kinase family because of the homology its C -terminus shares 
with the catalytic domain of PI3K.2 It is composed of two functionally separate protein 
complexes , mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2), that have varying 
upstream inputs and downstream outputs as well as sensitivity to rapamycin, with 
mTORC1 being the more sensitive complex.3 Once activated, mTORC1 directly 
phosphorylates the translation regulators p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic inhibition factor eIF4E binding protein 1 (4E -BP1) resulting in nucleotide 
and protein synthesis.
4 Additionally, phosphorylation status of S6K and 4E -BP1 are 
frequently used to assess mTORC1 activity in vivo.3 Conversely, the underpi[INVESTIGATOR_527286]2 role and function are yet to be fully understood. mTORC2 is thought to be 
rapamycin insensitive; however, long -term exposure in certain cell types reduces 
mTORC2 signaling.[ADDRESS_684443], either by [CONTACT_83141] -of-function mutations in oncogenes and/or loss -of-
function mutations in tumor suppressors, results in tumor growth, angiogenesis, resisting cell death, and metastasis.
[ADDRESS_684444] altered in multiple cancer 
types is the PI3K/AKT kinase cascade, which is the key kinase acting upstream of both 
mTORC1 and mTORC2. The PI3K/AKT signaling cascade is deregulated by [CONTACT_527310]3K, mutations or amplifications of 
AKT, overexpression of growth factor receptors human epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] 2 (HER -2), insulin- like growth factor receptor (IGFR), and platelet- derived 
growth factor receptor (PDGFR), or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) 
funct ion.3,6 mTOR downstream effectors S6K1, 4EBP1, and eIF4E are also implicated 
in tumor igenesis; however, their exact mechanisms of tumori genesis are yet t o be 
elucidated. Tumor formation is not only a consequence of aberrant activation of the 
mTOR pathway, but is also a result of familial cancer syndromes that interact upstream 
from this pathway; specifically, Peutz -Jeghers syndrome (mutation of the serine 
threonine kinase 11 (Lkb1)), Tuberous Sclerosis (mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2), and 
Cowden disease (loss of PTEN function).3 
 The overall survival for advanced stage or refractory pediatric intracranial and extra -
cranial solid tumor malignancies remains dismal.
7 The PI3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway has 
been implicated in several pediatric solid tumor malignancies. These findings are outlined below: 
 
• Neuroblastoma (NB):  Overexpression of PI3K p85, PI3K p110, p- Akt, and 
p-mTOR, and decreased PTEN expression, as well as, Akt activatio n have 
been identified as poor prognostic indicators.
8,9  
 
• Osteosarcoma  (OS): The PI3K/AKT pathway has been shown to be 
deregulated in a majority of localized OS and in 100% of advanced -stage 
disease.10 In addition amplification of the oncogene c -Myc is seen in 
approximately 10% of OS and upregulated by [CONTACT_527311], while cyclin D1 is overexpressed in 20% of OS and is a downstream target of 
mTORC1.
[ADDRESS_684445] also shown that in vitro  mTOR inhibition 
decreases proliferation, while in vivo  delays tumor progression and pulmonary 
metastasis.12

• Ewing Sarcoma (EWS):  EWS has a distinctive karyotypic abnormality 
involving the EWSR1 locus forming a fusion product with Fli -1, ERG, ETV1, 
or E1AF. These fusion proteins act as aberrant transcription factors and in in 
vitro  studies have been shown to interact with insulin like growth factor 1 
(IGF -1). IGF -1 indirectly activates PI3K through Ras signaling and via insulin 
receptor substrate 1 (IRS -1) leading to downstream activation of mTOR 
signaling.13 All EW S family of tumors express the IGF -1 receptor and this 
suggests a potential role for IGF -1 in tumori genesis.13 
 
• Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS): The chromosomal translocation involving the 
FOXO1 gene and the PAX3 or PAX7 gene occur in approximately  80% of 
alveolar RMS (ARMS), and are known to play a vital role in cell cycle 
dysregulation and tumorgenesis.14 The PAX3 -FOXO1 translocation decreases 
PTEN expression resulting in PI3K/Akt activation.13 The Children’s Oncology 
Group analyzed 64 primary RMS tumors via microarray and noted phosphorylated mTOR levels were increased in 60% of ARMS and 68% of 
embryonal RMS (ERMS) cases.
13  
 
• Medulloblastoma (MB):  Recent studies have linked the sonic hedgehog 
(SHH) signaling pathway as an important mediator in the activation of the 
mTOR pathway and its downstream effectors S6K and eIF4E.15   
 
• Gliomas: The signaling pathways that trigger the pathogenesis of pediatric 
gliomas have yet to be understood. Mueller et al. investigated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in low - and high- grade pediatric gliomas. Their 
study revealed that 80% of high -grade pediatric gliomas and 40% of low -grade 
gliomas showed activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and also 
suggested the tumor grade correlated negatively with PTEN expression.
16 
 
• Renal Tumors:  Currently, initial treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
involves mTOR inhibition.17 mTOR’s role in Wilms’ tumor is less defined; 
however, one study did reveal activation of the mTOR -signaling pathway in a 
metastatic lung lesion in a patient with Wilms’ tumor.18 
 
• Hepatic Tumors:  Both hepatoblastoma and he patocellular have deregulation 
of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways resulting in tumorgenesis.19,20 
 
2.1.3 Rapamycin vs. ABI -009 ( nab-Rapamycin) 
Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a potent allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1; yet, it has low oral bioavailability, poor solubility, and dose -limiting intestinal toxicity.
1,21 Temsirolimus, 
a prodrug of rapamycin and the only current intravenous “rapalog” preparation, has 
low water -solubility requiring formulation in surfactants and solvents; when infused, 
temsirolimus can potentially cause hypersensitivity reactions and decreased drug 
efficacy.21 ABI-009, nab-Rapamycin, is a novel human albumin- bound intravenous 
preparation of rapamycin. Albumin nanoparticle technology encapsulates lipophilic 
drugs into nanoparticles by [CONTACT_527308] a water based 
solvent under high pressure, resulting in nanoparticle size in the range of 100-200 
nM.22 This technology enhances permeability and retention (EPR) allowing 
accumulation of macromolecules (i.e.  drug albumin nanoparticles) in solid tumors.

THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
12 
Version Date: 06/19/2020 
 
This increased permeability and retention is important due to the underlying 
pathophysiology of tumor tissue defined by [CONTACT_241653], defective lymphatic 
drainage, and abnormal vascular architecture.22 ABI-009 is formulated in saline, has 
low anaphylaxis potential, and may improve drug delivery and efficacy.21 
 Proof of this concept has been demonstrated in preclinical studies comparing albumin -
bound paclitaxel nanopar ticles (nab - paclitaxel or ABI -007) vs. paclitaxel. Improved 
drug accumulation and antitumor response, as well as, enhanced biodistribution and 
increase in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was observed in the ABI -007 treated 
mice compared to those treated with paclitaxel.
22 Adult phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies 
of ABI -007 showed no hypersensitivity reactions when compared to paclitaxel; ABI -
007 showed increased response rates (33% vs. 19%) and prolonged tumor progression 
(22 vs.  16.9 weeks) in patients with metastatic breast cancer.[ADDRESS_684446] been numerous clinical trials evaluating mTOR inhibition in combination 
with a variety of chemotherapy backbone regimens in both adult and pediatric trials. 
Specifically, COG has investigated mTOR inhibition in combination with 
cyclophosphamide and vinorelbine (ARST0921) and in combination with irinotecan 
(IRN) and temozolomide (TMZ) (ADVL0918).23,[ADDRESS_684447] investigated this backbone in relapsed Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and other difficult to treat solid tumors suggesting its 
feasibility in children.  
 These studies contributed to the development of a COG Phase 1 trial (ADVL0918) 
evaluating temsirolimus (TEM) in combination with IRN and TMZ. This was a dose finding study evaluating escalating doses of intravenous TEM, oral TMZ, and oral 
IRN. Seventy- one eligible patients were enrolled with a var iety of solid tumor 
diagnoses, including CNS. Dose limiting toxicities included elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and triglycerides, anorexia, and thrombocytopenia. The MTD was 
identified as TEM 35 mg/m
2 weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 with IRN 90 mg/m2 and 
TMZ 125 mg/m2 on Days 1-5 of a 21- day cycle. Of the seventy -one patients enrolled, 
six patients had objective responses with three of those having sustained responses for ≥ 14 cycles of therapy.
23 
 To further delineate a starting dose of ABI -009, a review of published adult PKs of 
temsirolimus
26 and ABI -[ZIP_CODE] noted a starting dose of 45 mg/m2. When administered 
temsirolimus produces the sirolimus metabolite, and the AUC of temsirolimus + sirolimus metabolite from temsirolimus at a dose of 45 mg/m
2 is 3414 + [ZIP_CODE] = 
15,154 ng •h/ml. Since the molecular weight of temsirolimus (1030 g/mol) is similar to 
the molecular weight of sirolimus (914 g/mol), AUCs were summed without 
adjustment. The AUC of sirolimus from ABI -009 at 45 mg/m2 is 24,564 (ng •h/ml) 
which is at least twice the total exposure compared to temsirolimus based on sirolimus 
alone. Thus the A UC of sirolimus from ABI -009 is substantially higher than that from 
temsirolimus at an equal dose (45 mg/m2) of both drugs. A similar higher exposure of 
sirolimus with ABI -009 compared to temsirolimus would be expected at the lower dose

13 
Version Date: 06/19/2020 
 
of 35 mg/m2. Given that in the ADVL0918 study, the dose of 35 mg/m2 of temsirolimus 
was well tolerated in combination, the starting dose for ABI -009 was extrapolated to 
start at 35 mg/m2, understanding that this would roughly double the exposure of 
temsirolimus.  
 
Furthermore, the phase 1 trial evaluating ABI -009, determined that the majority of 
missed doses (83%) occurred on day 15 (the 3rd dose of every 4 -week schedule) (data 
unpublished). As a result, AADi has recently started two new phase [ADDRESS_684448] cancer, and multiple 
myeloma.27-30 Significant antitumor activity was observed across all tumor models 
tested at 40 mg/kg.[ADDRESS_684449] and colon xenograft models 
at dose levels of 0, 15, 30, 45, 90 and 180 mg/kg on an every 4 days times 3 schedule; pharmacokineti c properties were evaluated at dose levels of 1, 15, 30, and 45 mg/kg,

nausea (19%), anemia (19%), hypophosphatemia (19%), neutropenia (15%), and 
hypertriglyceridemia (15%). The study initially dose escalated from 100 mg/m2 to 150 
mg/m2 which resulted in 4 dose -limiting toxicities (D LTs), two at 150 mg/m2 and two 
at 125 mg/m2; these were grade [ADDRESS_684453] elevation and grade 4 thrombocytopenia and 
grade 3 suicidal ideation and grade 3 hypophosphatemia, respectively  (CTCAE v.4) . 
The MTD had only 1 grade 3 non- hematologic event (dyspnea) and 1 grade 3 
hematologic event (anemia) after cycle 1  (CTCAE v4) . Twenty -seven patients were 
enrolled on this trial; however, only 19 were evaluable for efficacy. There was 1 patient 
with adenocarcinoma of the kidney with a partial response, two patients with stable 
disease (mesothelioma and neuroendocrine tumor) with prolonged stabilization for [ADDRESS_684454] been conducted to date.  
2.3.3 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies 
The pharmacokinetic analysis showed an almost proportional increase of the maximum concentration (C
max) and area under the curve (AUC) with the outlier being a 
moderately low AUC at 125 mg/m2. The C max of ABI -009 was 3227.61 ng/mL that is 
significantly higher than levels achieved in other studies evaluating oral rapamycin and intravenous temsirolimus.
31,32 The half -life was 40 –91 hours across the tested dose 
range and was 63 hours at the MTD of 100 mg/m2. Circulating levels of the biomarkers 
S6K1 and 4EBP1 were significantly inhibited by [CONTACT_527312] -009 and inhibition was 
maintained for several days after administration at dose levels greater than 56.25 
mg/m2.

Program (PPTP) evaluated rapamycin in their xenograft models and noted a broad antitumor 
activity, with a significant activity in sarcoma models.33 The Children’s Oncology Group 
(COG) evaluated, in a Phase 2 trial (ARST0921), bevacizumab and temsirolimus in combination with vinorelbine (V) and cyclophosphamide (C) for initial relapse/progression 
for patients with RMS. Patients were randomized between the bevacizumab plus VC arm vs. 
temsirolimus plus VC arm. Patients that were randomized to the temsirolimus arm had a 
significantly improved EFS compared to the bevacizumab arm, 65% vs. 50%, respectively.

cycle. Additionally, Cycle 2+ will aim to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of ABI -009 in 
combination with temozolomide and irinotecan. The ABI -009 starting dose will be 35 mg/m2 
as a single agent during Cycle 1, while Cycle 2+ dosing a nd scheduling in combination with 
irinotecan (90 mg/m2) and temozolomide (125 mg/m2) will mimic the Phase 1 pediatric trial 
ADVL0918.23 
 
2.6 Rationale for Amendment # 4 (Addition of Dose Level -2 and modification of the 
definition of hematological DLT)  
With Amendment #4, an additional Dose Level -2 of 15 mg/m2 has been added. To date  
(08/21/19) , [ADDRESS_684457] enrolled onto the study. Five patients enrolled at Dose Level 1 
(35 mg/m2); two of these patients experienced a DLT of platelet count decrease within the 
first one to three cycles of protocol therapy. An additional 13 patients enrolled at Dose Level 
-1 (20 mg/m2) of which 7 patients are inevaluable. There were 2 DLTs (platelet count 
decrease) observed among the 6 evaluable patients.  This amendment will provide a dose 
reduction to 15 mg/m2 (Dose Level -2). We have reviewed our PK data for both Dose Level 
1 (35 mg/m2) and Dose Level -1 (20 mg/m2). The data notes the median AUC for Dose Level 
1 and Dose Level -1 to be 11,561 ( ng•h/m L) and 8,599 ( ng•h/mL), respectively. These 
median AUCs at these dose levels are well above the published AUCs for both temsirolim us 
and sirolimus. A Pediatric phase 1 trial evaluated weekly tem sirolimus in refractory/recurrent 
solid tumors at doses of 10, 25, 75, and 150 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15.34 The reported PK 
data indicates a median AUC for temsirolimus at doses of 10, 25, 75, and 150 mg/m2 to be 
1670, 3570, 2810, and 5190 (ng•h/m L), respectiv ely.34 In addition, sirolimus PK data was 
also investigated in this trial as following administratio n temsirolimus produces the sirolimus 
metabolite.34 The median AUCs for sirolimus in this study at the above doses were 2560, 
4520, 7670, and 8660 (ng•h/mL), respec tively .34 Review of the nab -rapamycin 
pharmacokinetics in adults demonstrates high variability (% coefficient of variation (CV), 
up to 40%) in both C max and AUC.21 In addition, for children and adolescent who received 
nab-rapamycin on this trial, PK parameters also had significan tly variability (CV at least 
35%). At Dose Level -1 (20mg/m2) : C max (mean 374 µg/L , median 368 µg/L , CV 39%) ; 
AUC inf (mean [ZIP_CODE]  µg•h/L, median 9749 µg•h/L, CV 37%); Clearance (mean 2.2 
L/h/m2, median 2 L/h/m2, CV 35%).  As noted previously, initial dosing for this study 
mimic the MTD  in ADVL0918.23 This stu dy evaluated temsirolimus  at 15mg/m2 in 
combination with irinotecan and temozolomide , thus further validating this suggested dose 
reduction.23 In addition, Raymond et al, noted in their trial evaluating the safety  and eff icacy 
of CCI -779, a nov el mTor i nhibitor, a partial response in a patient with renal cell carcinoma 
at a dose of 15 mg/m2. Thus, based upon the information, above, a dose reduction of ABI-
009 to 15 mg/m2 is likely to yield  a higher AUC then noted in the previous pediatric phase 1 
trial of temsirolimus  and that this dose would be in the therapeutic range. Given the 
significant variability in e xposures as dose reduction to 15 mg/m2 (Dose Level -2) ensures 
an adequate margin of safety with potential for clinical benefit. 
 
In addition, careful review of the dose limiting thrombocytopenia experienced during the trial 
to date, indicates that the platelet threshold (>75,000/mm3) for administration of day 8 
protocol therapy is the primary reason for declaration of DLT.  Based on the platelet nadir and recovery of patients with dose limiting thrombocytopenia, the platelet threshold for 
administration of day 8 protocol therapy has been modified to platelet count > 50,000/mm
3.  
In addition, grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) ≥ 7 days duration and grade 3 
thrombocytopenia (platelet count > 25,000/mm3 and <50,000/mm2) with clinically

* Pre -Amendment #4: Starting dose level is the RP2D from COG study 
ADVL0918. 
** Maximum temozolomide dose = 250 mg/dose 
^ Amendment #4: Starting dose level 
 
There will be no planned escalations beyond dose level 3 (55 mg/m2), as previous 
pediatric Phase [ADDRESS_684487] rarely defined an MTD greater than 160% of the adult MTD.  However, if evaluation of PK and toxicity data as well as additional data from 
adult studies suggest higher doses are required to achieve maximal potential benefit, 
an amendment to the trial will be considered to add additional dose levels.  
 
Amendment #4: 
DL- 2 will be evaluated with modified definitions of hematological DLT, and there 
will be no planned escalations beyond dose level -2. If DL  -2 is not well tolerated 
further de-escalation will not occur. The s tudy will be close d to accrual .  
 
5.3.2 Intra -Patient Escalation  
Intra -patient dose escalation is not allowed.  
 
5.4 Grading of Adverse Events  
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 5.0.  All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE  version 5.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP websit e (http://c tep.cancer.gov). Any suspected or confirmed 
dose-limiting toxicity should be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the St udy Chair.

Version Date: 06/19/2020 
 
 
5.5 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to protocol therapy. The DLT observation period for the purposes of dose -
escalation will be Cycles 1 and 2 of therapy.  
 
Dose limiting hematological and non- hematological toxicities are defined differently.  
 
5.5.1 Non-hematological dose -limiting toxicity  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Any Grade 3 or greater non- hematological toxicity attributable to the 
protocol therapy with the specifi c exclusion of:  
 
• Grade 3 nausea and vomiting < 3 days duration 
• Grade 3 liver enzyme elevation, including ALT/AST/GGT, that returns 
to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline prior to the time for the next treatment cycle. 
Note:   For the purposes of this study the ULN for ALT is defined as 45 
U/L and the ULN for AST is defined as 50 U/L , regardless of baseline . 
See Appendix XV  for values that represent thresholds between CTCAE 
grades for ALT, AST, GGT and bilirubin. 
• Grade 3 fever  
• Grade 3 infection  
• Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or 
hypomagnesemia responsive to supplementation. 
• Grade 3 or 4 hypertriglyceridemia that returns to Grade ≤ 2 prior to the start of the next treatment cycle. The severity (grade) of 
hypertriglyceridemia is based upon fasting levels. If Grade 3 or 4 
triglycerides are detected when routine (non -fasting) laboratory studies 
are performed, the test should be repeated within 3 days in the fa sting 
state to permit accurate grading  (see Section 6.4
). 
• Grade 3 hyperglycemia that returns to a fasting glucose value ≤ 250 
mg/dL or a fasting glucose of value ≤ 13.9 mmol/L (with or without the 
use of insulin or oral diabet ic agents) prior to the start of the next 
treatment cycle. Medical management of hyperglycemia should be based 
on fasting levels.   If routine (non -fasting) laboratory studies are 
performed and indicate the potential for intervention, the test should be 
repeated within 3 days in the fasting state to permit accurate medical 
management and grading  (see Section 6.6 ).  
• Grade 3 or 4 hypercholesterolemia that returns to ≤ Grade 2 after 
initiation of lipid lowering medication prior to the next treatment cycle. 
The severity (grade) of hypercholesterolemia is based upon fasting levels. 
If Grade 3 or 4 hypercholesterolemia is detected when routine (non-fasting) laboratory studies are performed, the test should be repeated 
within 3 days in the fasting state to permit accurate grading  (see 
Section 
6.5). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-hematological toxicity that causes a delay of > 21 days between 
treatment cycles.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Note: Allergic reactio ns that necessitate discontinuation of study drug will

not be considered a dose -limiting toxicity.  
 
5.5.2 Hematological dose limiting toxicity  
In patients evaluable for hematological toxicity (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), hematological 
dose- limiting toxicity is defined as:  
• Day 8:  
o Grade 4 neutropenia or platelets < 50,000/mm3 on Day 8 that does 
not resolve to ANC ≥ 750/mm3 and platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3 
(transfusion independent) by [CONTACT_2006] 11 will be considered dose -
limiting (see Section 6.1 ). 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25,000/mm3) for ≥ 7 days  
• Grade 4 anemia, not due to malignant infiltration. 
• Grade 4 neutropenia that lasts for > 7 days 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding, petechiae 
or purpura , o r  t h a t  p e r s i s t s  f o r  ≥  7  d a y s , and/or that requires platelet 
transfusion. 
• Myelosuppression that causes a delay of > 21 days between treatment 
cycles.

• Resume ABI -009 at same dose IF patient is asymptomatic, AND 
fasting serum glucose is consistently ≤ 250 mg/dL or  ≤ 13.9 
mmol  ) without glycosuria. The patient may continue to receive 
concomitant i nsulin or an oral diabetic agent for the management 
of hyperglycemia while receiving ABI -009. 
• If the fasting serum glucose value of   ≥ 250 – 500 mg/dL  or > 
13.9 – 27.8 mmol/L  recurs and does not return to a fasting value 
≤ 250 mg/dL or ≤ 13.9 mmol/L despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a stable dose of insulin 
and an oral diabetic agent Insulin and ano ral diabetic agents 
should be tried before declaring a patient’s hyperglycemia

value ≤ 250 mg/dL or ≤ 13.9 mmol/L  despi[INVESTIGATOR_527292], subsequent doses of ABI -009 should 
be decreased to the next lower dose level.  
• If a patient experiences recurrence of a fasting serum gluc ose ≥ 
250 mg/dL or > 13.9 mmol/L   which does not return to ≤ 250 
mg/dL or  ≤ 13.[ADDRESS_684502] dose

recurred despi[INVESTIGATOR_527293] -[ADDRESS_684503] dose level, 
the patient should be taken off protocol therapy.  
Grade 4  • Hold ABI -009 until resolution to fasting serum glucose is 
consistently ≤ 250 mg/dL or  ≤ 13.9 mmol. 
• Resume ABI -009 with one dose level reduction IF patient is 
asymptomatic AND serum glucose is consistently consistently ≤ 
250 mg/dL or  ≤ 13.9 mmol  without glycosuria. The patient may 
continue to receive concomitant insulin or an oral diabetic agent 
for the management of hyperglycemia while receiving ABI -009. 
• If Grade 4 hyperglycemia recurs and does not return to 
consistently ≤ 250 mg/dL or  ≤ 13.9 mmol ( despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a stable dose 
of insulin, an oral diabetic agent, and dose reduction to the next lower dose level, then subsequent doses of ABI -009 should be 
reduced again so that the new dose is two dose levels below the patient’s starting dose. If the patient was already being treated at 
the lowest dose level, or if the fasting serum g lucose is >  250 
mg/dL or  > 13.[ADDRESS_684504] dose level, the patient should be taken off 
protocol therapy.  
*Recommended guidelines for use of oral diabetic agents:  
Initiation of treatment for hyperglycemia should occur under the guidance of a pediatric 
endocrinologist at the local institution.  Metformin or other oral anti -hyperglycemia agent may 
be used per local endocrinologist’s recommendations. Insulin therapy should be directed by 
[CONTACT_458366], with the goal of normal fasting blood sugars < 126 mg/dL and 
HgbA1C < 8%. 
 
7.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE AND OTHER CONCOMITANT THERAPY

Version Date: 06/19/2020 
 
7.1 Concurrent Anticancer Therapy  
Concurrent cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or 
biologic therapy may NOT be administered to patients receiving study drug. If these treatments are administered the patient will be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
7.2 Investigational Agents 
No other investigational agents may be given while the patient is on study.  
 
7.3 Supportive Care  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics (except aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]), fluids, electrolytes and 
general supportive care are to be used as necessary. See Appendix VIII
 for information on 
management of i rinotecan -induced diarrhea. See Appendix X , Appendix XI II, and Appendix 
XIV for drugs that should not be used concomitantly due to potential interactions with ABI -009, 
irinotec an, or temozolomide.  
 Please refer to COG Supportive Care Guidelines found under the Protocol Reference Materials 
tab under Standard Sections for Protocols at 
https://childrensoncologygr oup.org/index.php/cog -supportive -care-guidelines. 
 
7.4 Growth Factors  
Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function can only be administered in accordance with Section 6.2
 or for culture proven bacteremia or invasive 
fungal infection. The Study Chair should be notified before growth factors are initiated. 
 
7.5 Concomitant Medications (Study Specific)  
 
a. HMG- CoA reductase inhibitors may be used to treat elevated fasting triglycerides  
and cholesterol . See  Section 6.4 and Section 6.5 . 
 
While on study, the following BCRP inhibitors (cyclosporine, eltrombopag, 
gefitinib) should be avoided if possible, and concomitant use of UGT1A1 
inhibitors, such as diclofenac, ketoconazole, probenecid, silibinin, nilotinib and atazanavir, should be avoided because of potential for increased irinotecan toxicity.  
 
Because rapamycin is a substrate for both CYP3 A4 and P-gp, concomitant 
administration with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and P- gp may alter the 
pharmacokinetics of ABI-009. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 may decrease the metabolism 
of rapamycin and increase rapamycin concentrations, while inducers of CYP3A4 
may increase the metabolism of rapamycin and decrease rapamycin concentrations. 
Drugs that may increase rapamycin blood concentrations include antifungal agents 
(e.g., voriconazole , itraconazole , posaconazole ), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., 
clarithromycin, telithromycin ), and other drugs (e.g., HIV -proteas e inhibitors). 
Drugs that may decrease rapamycin concentrations include anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin), and antibiotics (e.g., rifabutin, 
rifampin). See Appendix XIV
 for more information on CYP3A4 inducers and 
inhibitors.

Teratogenic effects were not observed in animal 
reproduction studies. Cefixime crosses the placenta and 
can be detected in the amniotic fluid. There are no well -
controlled studies of cefixime in pregnant women; 
effects of cefixime on the fetus are unknown. An increase 
in most types of birth defects was not found following 
first trimester exposure to cephalosporins. It is not known 
whether cefixime is excreted in human milk. 
 
9.2.3 Formulation and Stability  
Cefixime is available in scored 400 mg film coated tablets, 400 mg capsules, 100 mg 
chewable tablets, and 200 mg chewable tablets.  The chewabl e tablets are tutti- frutti 
flavor and contain aspartame and fd&c red #40 aluminum lake.  Cefixime is also 
available in two strengths as a powder for oral suspension, which when reconstituted, provides either a 100 mg/5mL or 200 mg/5 mL suspension. The powder for oral 
suspension is strawberry flavored and contains sodium benzoate, sucrose, and xanthan 
gum.  After reconstitution, suspension may be stored for 14 days at room temperature 
or under refrigeration.  
 Cefixime tablets and powder for oral suspension are stored at 20 - 25°C (68 - 77°F). 
Do not freeze. The suspension bottle should be kept tightly closed.  
 
9.2.4 Guidelines for Administration 
See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the protocol.  
 
Cefixime may be administered with or without food. Administration with food may

camptothecin), Camptosar®], NSC #616348    (03/0 7/17) 
 
9.3.1 Source and Pharmacology 
Irinotecan is a semisynthetic water -soluble analog of camptothecin (a plant alkaloid 
isolated from Camptotheca acuminata) . Irinotecan is a prodrug that requires 
conversion, by [CONTACT_99230]- I inhibitor, 
SN-[ADDRESS_684520] with the ternary complex formed by [CONTACT_99231] I, DNA, and either irinotecan  or 
SN-38. Renal excretion is a minor route of elimination of irinotecan. The majority 
of the drug is metabolized in the liver. SN-38 is conjugated to glucuronic acid and this metabolite has no anti- tumor activity. The extent of conversion of SN -38 to its 
glucu ronide has been inversely correlated with the risk of severe diarrhea, because 
the other major route of SN-38 excretion is biliary excretion by [CONTACT_99232] (cMOAT) which presumably leads to 
mucosal injury. In addition, APC and NPC are oxidative metabolites of irinotecan 
dependent on the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. After intravenous infusion of irinotecan  in 
humans, irinotecan  plasma concentrations decline in a multiexponential manner, 
with a mean terminal elimination half -life of about 6 to 12 hours. The mean 
terminal elimination half -life of the active metabolite SN -38 is about 
10 to  20 hours. Irinotecan  is 30% to 68% bound to albumin and SN-38 is 
approximately 95% bound to albumin.

Pregnancy & 
Lactation Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of irinotecan have been noted in animals at 
doses similar or less than those used in humans. Toxicities include: decreased 
skeletal ossification, multiple anomalies, low birth weight and increased fetal 
mortality. It is not known if irinotecan is excreted into breast milk but it is 
excreted into rat milk.  
(L) Toxicity may also occur later  
 
 
9.3.3 Formulation & Stability 
Each mL of irinotecan injection contains 20 mg irinotecan  (on the basis of the 
trihydrate salt), 45 mg sorbitol,  and 0.9 mg lactic acid. When necessary, pH has been 
adjusted to 3.5 (range, 3.0 to 3.8) with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. 
Irinotecan is available in single- dose amber glass vials in 40  mg (2  mL),100 mg 
(5 mL), 300 mg (15 mL), and 500 mg (25 mL). Store at controlled room temperature 
15°-30°C (59° -86°F). Protect from light. It is recommended that the vial (and 
backing/plastic blister) should remain in the carton until the time of use.  
9.3.4 Guidelines for Administration 
See Treatment and Dose Modifications sections of the protocol.  
 For oral use, the appropriate volume of irinotecan solution (20 mg/ml) is dr awn up 
undiluted into a plastic oral syringe. Each dose is to be mixed with juice (crangrape, cranapple, cranberry, or other “cran” juice or juice cocktail) immediately before 
administration. The oral syringes containing undiluted irinotecan are stable for  21 days 
when stored in a refrigerator. Irinotecan has a very unpleasant flavor, therefore, the juice will be used to mask the drug taste (See Appendix VI
). See protocol for pre -
medication and supportive care measures.

9.4 TEMOZOLOMIDE - ORAL  
(Temodar, Temodal) NSC #362856     (06/26/18) 
 
9.4.1 Source and Pharmacology: 
An orally administered alkylating agent, a second generation imidazotetrazine. A 
prodrug of MTIC, temozolomide spontaneously decomposes to MTIC at physiologic 
pH. Exerts its effect by [CONTACT_12783] -linking DNA. This is  likely a site -specific alkylation at the 
O6-position of guanine with some effect at the N7-position. Temozolomide reaches its 
peak concentration in 1 hour. Food reduces the rate and extent of absorption. It has an 
elimination half -life of 1.13 hr (intra peritoneally) and 1.29 hr (orally) with an oral 
bioavailability of 0.98. Total apparent body clearance is 100  mL/min/m2 and plasma 
elimination half -life is ~  100 minutes.

Pregnancy & 
Lactation Pregnancy Category D  
Adequate, well-controlled studies have not been conducted in humans. Women of 
childbearing potential should be advised against becoming pregnant w hile taking 
temozolomide and for at least 6 mo nths following the end of therapy. 
Temozolomide administration to rats and rabbits at 3/8 and 3/4 the human dose 
resulted in the development of malformations of the external organs , soft tissues, 
and skeleton. These animal studies also demonstrated embryolethality (increased 
resorptions) at similar doses. There is no information available regarding the 
transmission of temozolomide during lactation; women should avoid breastfeeding 
while receiving temozolomide.  
 
9.4.3 Formulation and Stability 
Temozolomide capsules are available in six different strengths (5, 20, 100, 140, 180, 
250 mg). The capsules vary in size, color, and imprint according to strength. In the US, capsules are packaged in [ADDRESS_684521] been caused by [CONTACT_95431]/taking the wrong number of capsules per day and/or product usage exceeding the prescribed dosing

When dispensing, it is extremely important that prescribing and dispensing include 
clear instructions on which capsules, and how many of each capsule(s) are to be taken per day. Only dispense what is needed for the course, and clearly indicate how many 
days of dosing the patient will have and how many days are without temozolomide 
dosing. When counseling patients, it is important for each patient/parent to understand the number of capsules per day and the number of days that they take temozolomide. 
It is al so important for the patient/parent to understand the number of days that they 
will be off the medication.  
 Each strength of temozolomide must be dispensed in a separate vial or in its original 
container (e.g., bottle or sachet). Based on the dose prescribed, determine the number 
of each strength of temozolomide capsules needed for the full course as prescribed by 
[CONTACT_099]. For example, 275 mg/day for 5  days would be dispensed as five 250 mg 
capsules, five 20 mg capsules, and five 5 mg capsules. Label  each container with the 
appropriate number of capsules to be taken each day. Dispense to the patient/parent, making sure each container lists the strength (mg) per capsule and that he or she 
understands to take the appropriate number of capsules of temozolomide from each 
bottle or vial to equal the total daily dose prescribed by [CONTACT_099]. Institutions that 
have the capability to dispense temozolomide as daily doses in a blister pack may do so, taking specific precautions to ensure that the appropriate dose is provided and that 
the patient is educated to understand the daily dosing regimen.  
 For children unable to swallow the capsules whole, the oral capsules may be formulated 
into a suspension. To prepare a 10 mg/mL suspension triturate the contents of  ten 100 
mg capsules (1000 mg), 500 mg povidone K -30 and 25 mg anhydrous citric acid 
dissolved in 1.5 mL purified water in a glass mortar to form a uniform paste. To the paste add 50 mL of Ora -Plus
® by [CONTACT_1583] a small amount, mixing, and then adding the bal ance. 
Transfer to a glass graduated cylinder. Add Ora -Sweet® or Ora -Sweet® SF to a total 
volume of 100 mL by [CONTACT_439227] (Ora -Sweet® 
or Ora -Sweet® SF). Rinse at least four times. Package in an amber plastic prescripti on 
bottle. The packaged suspension should be stored in the refrigerator at 2°-8°C (36 -46°F) 
for no more than [ADDRESS_684522] be used in 2 hours after mixing  (See

i) Pregnancy  
 
Patients who are removed from protocol therapy during cycle [ADDRESS_684523] resolved per Section 13.4.4 , whichever happens LATER. 
The only exception is with documentation of the patient’s withdrawal of consent. Patients who are removed from protocol therapy in subsequent cycles should  have the 
necessary observations to ensure adequate clinical care.  
 
Patients who are off protocol therapy are to be followed until they meet the criteria for Off 
Study (see below). Ongoing adverse events, or adverse events that emerge after the patient 
is removed from protocol therapy, but within [ADDRESS_684524] and CTEP -AERS (if applicable).  Follow -up data 
will be required unless consent is withdrawn. 
 
10.2 Off Study Criteria  
 
a) Thirty days after the last dose of the investigational agent.  
b) Death  
c) Lost to follow -up 
d) Withdrawal of consent for any required observations or data submission.

11.1.1  Amendment #4  
The projected maximum number of additional (i.e., in addition to the 18 already 
enrolled) evaluable patients required to complete the study with this amendment is 
12. This includes 6 evaluable patients at DL -2 and 6 additional evaluable patients 
in a PK expansion cohort. Therefore, the projected maximum number of addition al 
patients enrolled into the study  allowing for 30% inevaluability is 18, and this 
number is expected to be accrued over 9-[ADDRESS_684526] an 
expected maximum of 36 patients.  
The study design includes several contingencies that may increase the maximum 
sample size if all contingencies are needed to estimate the MTD. A maximum of 26 
additional patients may be possible in the unlikely scenario that DL-2 requires 
expansion to 12 patients plus 6 additional patients for pharmacokinetic analysis and 
a 30% inevaluable rate. The maximum sample size of [ADDRESS_684527] one dose of the study drug(s) or who experiences a dose -limiting toxicity is considered evaluable for Adverse E vents. In addition, for 
the dose -escalation portion during Cycle s [ADDRESS_684528] 85% 
of the prescribed dose of protocol therapy per protocol guidelines in Cycle 1 and 
85% of the prescribed dose of protocol therapy in Cycle 2, and must have the 
appropriate toxicity monitoring studies performed to be considered evaluable for 
dose limiting toxicity. Patients who do not have DLT and are not considered evaluable for toxicity will be replaced.  
 
11.2.2  Maximum Tolerated Dose 
• The MTD will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one -third of patients 
experience a DLT (See Section 5.5 ) during Cycle s 1 and 2 of therapy.  
 
• In the unlikely event that two DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable patients are 
different classes of Adverse Effects (e.g. hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression), 
AND all of the following conditions are met, expansion of the cohort to 12 
patients will be considered:  
 
•  One of the DLTs does not appear to be dose- related  
•  The Adverse Effects are readily reversible  
•  The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice chair, and IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable  
 
If fewer than 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose- limiting 
toxicities, the dose escalation can proceed.  
 
• The DLTs observed in the pharmacokinetic (PK) expansion cohort will be 
counted towards the total number of DLTs observed at the MTD during the dose escalation portion of the study. If ≥ 1/3 of the cohort of pat ients at the MTD 
(during the dose escalation plus the PK expansion) experience DLT then the MTD will be exceeded.

Version Date: 06/19/[ADDRESS_684529] of this study36. Two to six 
patients can be conc urrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the number of 
patients enrolled at the current dose level, (2) the number of patients who have experienced 
DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the number of patients entered but with tolerability 
data pending at the current dose level.  Accrual is suspended when a cohort of six has enrolled or when the study endpoints have been met.  
 
Dose level assignment is based on the number of participants currently enrolled in the cohort, 
the number of DLTs observed, and the number of participants at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a DLT 
(i.e., participants enrolled but who are not yet assessable for toxicity). For example, when three participants are enrolled onto a dose cohort, if toxicity data is available for all thr ee 
when the fourth participant entered and there are no DLTs, the dose is escalated and the 
fourth participant is enrolled to the subsequent dose level. If data is not yet avail able for one 
or more of the first three participants and no DLT has been observ ed, or if one DLT has been 
observed, the new participant is entered at the same dose level. Lastly, if two or more DLTs 
have been observed, the dose level is de- escalated. This process is repeated for participants 
five and six. In place of suspending accru al after every three participants, accrual is only 
suspended when a cohort of six is filled. When participants are inevaluable for toxicity, they are replaced with the next available participant if escalation or de- escalation rules have not 
been fulfilled at the time the next available participant is enrolled onto the study.

used in the RECIST v 1.1 criteria. 
 
12.2.1  Definitions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable for objective response : Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle [ADDRESS_684535] had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for 
response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response: Patients who have lesions 
present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target 
disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
12.2.2  Disease Parameters  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable disease : Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_684536] x -ray, as ≥ [ADDRESS_684537] scan, or ≥ [ADDRESS_684538] be 
recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note :  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area must 
show definitive evidence of progression to be considered 
evaluable.

[IP_ADDRESS] Malignant lymph nodes: To be c onsidered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_684539] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline 
and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 
≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-
measurable.  
 
Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither 
measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], 
simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if t hey meet the definition 
of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions 
are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per  
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be represe ntative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the  
next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only 
the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
  
12.2.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
   ADVL1514 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY

Version Date: 06/19/2020 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_99237](s) being  followed cannot be image d but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when 
they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 
10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, 
CT is preferable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Conventional CT and MR I:  This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slic e thickness is [ADDRESS_684540] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body  scans). Ideally, 
the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol 
should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of 
a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT  quality for 
use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the  site can document that 
the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for REC IST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investig ator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone  cannot be used to assess response.  
If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cytology, Hi stology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases 
(e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where 
known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 
 Cytology should be obtained if an effusion appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease.

66 
Version Date: 06/19/2020 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] FDG -PET:  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, 
it is sometimes reasonable to inco rporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to 
complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly 
possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can 
be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the 
positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease 
confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the  positive FDG -PET at follow -up is 
not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT 
scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at 
that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to 
a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis 
of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
 
Note :  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid with 
an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the 
attenuation corrected image.  
  
12.2.4  Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumor and Measurable Disease  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target an d non- target lesions. 
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <[ADDRESS_684541] be detected by [CONTACT_6777].  
Normalization of urinary catecholamines or othe r 
tumor markers if elevated at study enrollment (for patients with neuroblastoma).  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline 
sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest 
sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that 
is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Note:  in presence of SD 
or PR in target disease but unequivocal progression in non- target or non- measurable disease, the patient

has PD  if there is an overall level of substantial 
worsening in non- target disease such that the 
overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to 
merit discontinuation of therapy  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on study 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis) 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non- target 
lesions. Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.

analysis of treatment effect. Best response is determined as outlined in  Section 12.[ADDRESS_684545] show viable 
neuroblastoma.  
12.4.2  The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by [CONTACT_6778]:  
 
Complete response :  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Parti al Response :  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persistence of other MIBG positive lesions  
Stable disease :  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions 
Progressive disease: Development of new MIBG positive lesions 
 
12.4.3  The response  of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
   ADVL1514

scale14 as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess efficacy 
for study endpoint. See Section 8.2 for details on transferring images to the Imaging 
Research Center.  
 NOTE: This scoring should also be done by [CONTACT_527320].  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10
th 
general sector allocated for any extra- osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded as:  
0 = no site per segment,  1 = 1 site per segment,  
2 = more than one site per segment,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score is obtained by [CONTACT_6780]. See diagram 
of sectors below:  
 
 
The relative score is calculated by [CONTACT_527321]- treatment absolute score. The relative score of each patient is 
calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and classified as below:  
 
1. Complete response: all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved. If 
morphological evidence of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_431649], no tumor cells can be detected by [CONTACT_527322][INVESTIGATOR_6714] 21 days 
apart to be considered a Complete Response . 
2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced). 
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).  
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.

12.5 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement  
 
12.5.1  Bone Marrow Involvement  
Bone marrow obtained within 28 days prior to study enrollment with tumor cells 
seen on routine morphology (not by [CONTACT_442837]) of bilateral 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_99203]. 
 Bone Marrow responses are determined by H&E Staining of bilateral bone marrow 
biopsies and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026].  
 
Complete Response :  No tumor cells detectable by [CONTACT_6785] [ADDRESS_684547] 21 days apart. Normalization of urinary 
catecholamines or other tumor markers if elevated at study 
enrollment.  
 
Progressive Disease :  In patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone marrow 
by [CONTACT_527323] a 
doubling in the amount of tumor in the marrow AND a 
minimum of 25% tumor in bone marrow by [CONTACT_5293]. (For example, a patient entering with 5% tumor in marrow 
by [CONTACT_6787] ≥ 25% tumor to have progressive disease; a patient entering with 30% tumor must 
increase to > 60%).

72 
Version Date: 06/19/[ADDRESS_684548] 21 days apart.  
 
Stable Disease: Persi stence of tumor in bone marrow that does not meet the 
criteria for either complete response or progressive disease.  
 
12.5.[ADDRESS_684549] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as described in Section 12.[ADDRESS_684550] CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered a 
“target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. If multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should be selected as “target” 
lesions. Target l esions should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for 
accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non -target 
lesions. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the thickness of the slices s howing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect (e.g., 
8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice).  
 
Any change in size of non- target lesions should be noted, though does not need to be 
measured.  
 
12.6.[ADDRESS_684551] perpendicular diameter. Development of new disease or progression in any established lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response in other lesions – e.g., when multi ple lesions show opposite responses, the progressive 
disease takes precedence. Response Criteria for target lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
• Partial response (PR):  ≥ 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the initial baseline measurements.  
   ADVL1514 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
73 
Version Date: 06/19/2020 
 
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of 
the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify  for PR, nor 
sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  25% or more increase in the sum of the products of 
the perpendicular diameters of the target lesions, taking as reference the smallest 
sum of the products observed since the start of treatment, or the appearance of 
one or more new lesions. 
 
12.6.5  Response Criteria for Non- Target Lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
• Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  The persistence of one or more 
non-target lesions.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  
 
12.6.6  Response criteria for tumor markers (if available):  
Tumor markers will be classified simply as being at normal levels or at abnormally high 
levels.  
 
12.6.7  Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and non -
target lesions, the appearance of new lesions and normalization of markers (where 
applicable), according to the criteria described in the table below. The overall 
response assessment is shown in the last column, and depends on the assessments of 
target, non-target, marker and new lesions in the preceding columns.

Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until 
the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking 
as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are f irst 
met for CR unti l the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.  
 
 
 
13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done 
to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies 
using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a 
trial. (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the Case Report Forms for this 
protocol). Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for 
optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information about 
   ADVL1514 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
75 
Version Date: 06/19/2020 
 
expedited reporting. 
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received 
an investigational or com mercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered serious; 3) the 
grade (severity); and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60778].  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but 
is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label. 
 
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source.  The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
13.1 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  version 5.0. The descriptions 
and grading scales found in the CTCAE  version 5.[ADDRESS_684554] access to a copy of the CTCAE  version 
5.0. A copy of the CTCAE  version 5.0  can be downloaded from the CTEP website  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ ctc.htm .). 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  version 5.0. 
 
Step 3 :  Review Table A in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol- specific exceptions to the reporting requirements.  
 
Note:  This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_684555] dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be reported according to the instructions in the table below. 
Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, 
Probable, and Definite.

during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP -AERS reporting unless (1) the Grade increases; or (2) 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205].  
 
13.2 When to Report an Event in an Expedited Manner  
 
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A ) to NCI via the 
web at http://ctep.cancer.gov ( email the ADVL1514 COG S tudy Assigned Research 
Coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event if the CTEP -AERS 24 -Hour 
Notification web -based application is unavailable) and by [CONTACT_99243]. 
Once internet connectivity is restored, a [ADDRESS_684560] be entered 
electronically into CTEP- AERS by [CONTACT_433].  
 
• When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within 5 or 7 
calendar days  of learning of the event (refer to Table A ). 
 
• Expedited AE reporting for this study must only use CTEP -AERS (Adverse Event Expedited 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP home page https://eapps-
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers.  
13.3 Expedited Reporting Methods  
 
13.3.1  CTEP -AERS Reporting 
To report adverse events in an expedited fashion use the NCI’s Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System (CTEP -AERS) that can be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov. 
 
A CTEP -AERS report must be submitted electronically via the CTEP -AERS Web -
based application locat ed at  https://cte pcore.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers . If prompted to 
enter a sponsor email address, please type in: 
[EMAIL_1961] . 
 Email supporting documentation to the ADVL1514 COG Study Assigned Research 
Coordinator. ALWAYS include the ticket number on all faxed and emailed 
documents . 
 
 
13.4 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events  
  
Note:  These guidelines below are for repor ting adverse events on the COG case report 
forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP- AERS reporting.  
   ADVL1514 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
79 
Version Date: 06/19/2020 
 
 
13.4.1  If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the 
most severe grade of the event should be reported.  
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_684561] (most severe) grade of the Adverse Effects.  
 13.4.4  The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
baseline or less than or equal to Grade 1, whichever level is higher (note that the resolution date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the AE 
decreased from its highest grade) .  If the AE does not return to baseline the resolution 
date should be recorded as "ongoing."   
 13.4.[ADDRESS_684562] be reported each course it recurs.  
 
13.5 Other Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_6681]  
 
13.5.1  Events that do not meet the criteria for CTEP- AERS reporting ( Section 13.2
) should 
be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the CRF packet (See 
Section 14.1 ). 
 13.5.[ADDRESS_684563] reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair, to the 
FDA (when COG holds the IND) and to the pharmaceutical company (for industry 
sponsored trials).  
 
13.5.[ADDRESS_684564] responsible for 
oversight of the patient.  
 
13.6 Reportin g Secondary AML/MDS 
All cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that 
occur in patients following their chemotherapy for cancer must be reported to the NCI Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) via CTEP -AERS and included as part of the second 
malignant neoplasm reporting requirements for this protocol (see data submission packet). Submit the completed CTEP -AERS report within 14 days of an AML/MDS diagnosis 
occurring after protocol treatment for cancer.  
  
 Secondary Maligna ncy:  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
   ADVL1514 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
80 
Version Date: 06/19/2020 
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under 
an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP- AERS. Three options are available to describe the 
event:  
1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic  
leukemia [AML])  
2) Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
3) Treatment -related secondary malignancy.  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. 
Second Malignancy :  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine 
reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified. 
 
13.7 Reporting Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss , and Death Neonatal  
When submitting CTEP -AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal 
loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed and emailed to the ADVL1514 
COG Study Assigned Research Coordinator along with any additional medical information 
(Appendix III
). The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent should 
be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP- AERS report.  
 
13.7.1  Pregnancy  
• Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents which may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy 
occurring on study or within [ADDRESS_684565] dose of study therapy should be reported in an expedited m anner via CTEP -AERS as 
Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(Pregnancy) under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC 
and reported as Grade 3. 
 
• Pregnancy should be followed until the outcome is known. If the baby i s 
born with a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS report is 
required. 
 
13.7.2  Fetal Death  
• Pregnancy  loss is defined in CTCAE version 5.0 as “Death in utero.” 
 
•  Any pregnancy loss  should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 
“Pregnancy  loss” under the  Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions 
SOC. Do NOT report a pregnancy loss as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS 
recognized any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
 
13.7.3  Death Neonatal  
• Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE version 5.0 as “ Newborn deaths 
occurri ng during the first 28 days after birth” that is felt by [CONTACT_527324]/intervention, should 
be reported expeditiously. 
   ADVL1514 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
81 
Version Date: 06/19/2020 
 
 
• A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as  “Death neonatal” 
under the “general disorders and administration” SOC when the death is the 
result of a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study. 
 
• Neonatal death should NOT be reported as “Death neonatal” under the 
General disorders and administration SOC, a Grade 5 event. If reported as 
such, the CTEP -AERS interprets this as a death of the patient being treated.  
 
Pregnancy should be followed up until the outcome of the pregnancy is known at intervals deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_6795]. The “Pregnancy Information Form” should be used 
for all necessary follow-ups. This form is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/PregnancyReport
Form.pdf .  
 
14.0 RECORDS, REPORTING, AND DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN

This study is supported by [CONTACT_6818] (CTSU).  
 
IRB Approval:   
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this protocol and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office before they can be approved to enroll patients.  
Assignment of site registration status in the CTSU Regulatory Support System (RSS) uses extensive data to make a 
determination of whether a site has fulfilled all regulatory criteria including but not limited to the following: 
• An active Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number 
• An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization 
• A valid IRB approval 
• Compliance with all protocol specific requirements. 
 
In addition, the site- protocol Principal Investigator (PI) must meet the following criteria:  
• Active registration status  
• The IRB number of the site IRB of record listed on their Form FDA 1572 
• An active status on a participating roster at the registering site.  
 Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that are approved by [CONTACT_527333]. For sites using the CIRB, IRB approval information is received 
from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in an automated process. Signatory Institutions must submit a Study Specific 
Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB via IRBManager to indicate their intent to open the study locally.  The 
CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then communicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office.  In order for the SSW appr oval to be 
processed, the Signatory Institution must inform the CTSU which CIRB-approved institutions aligned with the Signatory Institution are participating in the study.  
 
Requirements for ADVL1514  Site Registration:  
 
• IRB approval (For sites not particip ating via the NCI CIRB; local IRB documentation, an IRB- signed CTSU IRB 
Certification Form, Protocol of Human Subjects Assurance Identification/IRB Certification/Declaration of Exemption 
Form, or combination is accepted ) 
• For applicable studies with a radiation and/or imaging (RTI) component, the enrolling site must be aligned to a RTI 
provider.  To manage provider associations access the Provider Association tab on the CTSU website at https://www.ctsu.org/RSS/RTFProviderAssociation
, to add or remove associated providers.  Sites must be linked to at 
least one IROC credentialed provider to participate on trials with an RT component. Enrolling sites are responsible for ensuring that the  appropriate agreements are in place with their RTI provider, and that appropriate IRB approvals are 
in place.   
 
Submitting Regulatory Documents:  
Submit required forms and documents  to the CTSU Regulatory Office, where they will be entered and tracked in the 
CTSU RSS.  
 
Regulatory Submission Portal: www.ctsu.org   (members’ area)  Regulatory Tab Regulatory Submission  
When applicable, original documents should be mailed to: 
CTSU Regulatory Office  
[ADDRESS_684586]

Study 
Doctor:       Study 
[CONTACT_25566] #:        Study 
Drug(s):  ABI-009 
 
 
Please show this paper to all your healthcare providers (doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists), 
and tell them you are taking part in a clinical trial sponsored by [CONTACT_29630].  
 
These are the things that your healthcare providers need to know:  
ABI-009 interacts with certain specific enzyme(s) in your liver or other tissues like the gut, AND certain transport 
proteins that help move drugs in and out of cell. 
 
 Explanation  
CYP 
isoenzymes   The enzyme(s) in question is  CYP3A4 . ABI-009 is broken down by [CONTACT_527334].  
 
Protein 
transporters    
The protein(s) in question is P -glycoprotein. ABI-009 is moved in and out of 
cells/organs by [CONTACT_527335].  
 
These are the things that you need to know:  
The study drug ABI -009, may interact with other drugs which can cause side effects. For this reason, it is very important 
to tell your doctors about all your medicines, including: (a) medicines you are taking before this clinical trial, (b) 
medicines you start or stop taking duri ng this study , (c) medicines you buy without a prescription (over-the-counter 
remedy) , (d) herbals or supplements (e.g. St. John’s Wort). It is helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated 
medication list with you.  
 
Before you enroll onto the clinical trial, your study doctor will work with your regular health care providers to review any 
medicines and herbal supplements that are considered strong inducers/inhibitors of CYP3A4 enzyme and P-glycoprotein. 
• Please be very careful!  Over-the-counter drugs (including herbal supplements) may contain ingredients that could 
interact with your study drug.  Speak to your doctors or pharmacist to determine if there could be any side effects.  
o St. John’s Wort, graperf ruit or grapefruit juice  
• Make sure your doctor knows to avoid certain prescription medications.  
o Antofungal agents (e.g., voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, 
telithromycin), anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin), and antibiotics (e.g., 
rifabutin, rifampin) and other drugs (e.g., HIV-protease inhibitors, amiodarone, dronedarone, carvedilol).  
• Your regular health care provider should check a frequently updated medical reference or call yo ur study doctor 
before prescribing any new medicine or discontinuing any medicine.

  Skin and soft tissue infections  (SSTIs) are an extremely common reason for children to seek care .  
Four in 100 children will experience a medically attended SSTI  annually , resulting in over 2 million  visits to 
doctors’ office s and emergency departments annually among children  in the U.S . Among the general 
population, c hildren are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_28474]-S. aureus  SSTIs. SSTIs can lead to severe 
disease that can cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], bacteremia, disseminated  disease , critical illness, and death.  
The most common ly identified  cause of SSTIs is Staphylococcus aureus , including  methicillin -
resistant S. aureus  (MRSA) . S. aureus ’ success as a bacterial infection is related to its ability to 
asymptomatically colonize patients and later cause disease.  Another aspect of its success is its ability to 
cause infection in both immunocompromised and non -immunocompromised hosts. Most SSTIs  in children 
occur  in otherwise healthy children.  Of great concern is that, a fter an initial S. aureus  SSTI, recurrence rates 
of S. aureus  skin infections can exceed 50%.  
Because of the large burden of S. aureus SSTIs  in the community, there is a large interest in SSTI 
prevention.  However,  clinical trials  of S. aureus SSTI prevention have been very disappointing.  Fritz et al. 
found that skin d ecolonization  with chlorhexidine  (CHG) of  affected children and their  household members 
has been found superior to decolonizing just the affected child. However, the magnitude  of decrease was 
minimal and 52% of children in the more aggressive  decolonization regimen  experienced  a SSTI during the 
[ADDRESS_1087818] focu sed on removing colonization in 
the anterior nares (nose) and skin.  A recent investigation by  [CONTACT_789751] S. 
aureus SSTI  and their household members , the most common site of colonization of S. aureus  on the 
human body is not the anterior nares, but the orophary nx (26% vs. 24%) , with overlap of  colonization far 
from universal. In fact, 50% of oropharyngeally colonized persons were not nasally colonized . Other 
investigations show a similar magnitude  of S. aureus orpharyngeal colonization.  There are mounting data 
that decolonization regimens that ignore the pharynx are not effective at preventing recurrent S. aureus  
SSTIs.  However, prospective  data on oropharyngeal decolonization of S. aureus in children  are lacking . 
We hypothesize that subop timal S. aureus prevention efforts stem from previous  inattention to 
eradication  of S. aureus  oropharyngeal colonization . To this end, w e will conduct a clinical trial on 
eradication of oropharyngeal S. aureus  colonization . Data from our “proof of principle” study will form the 
foundation of more comprehensive efforts to prevent recurrent S. aureus  infections in children.  
We will perform a prospective, double blind , randomized controlled clinical trial of 0.12% 
chlorhexidine (CHG)  oral rinse versus placebo  oral rinse  for children age 5-17 with S. aureus  orophary ngeal 
colonization. We hypothesize that , compared to placebo,  0.12% CHG rinse will reduce oral S. aureus  
colonization.  We choose CHG given its wide avail ability , excellent safety  profile , and low cost. W e will enroll 
[ADDRESS_1087819] S. aureus orophary ngeal colonization during a screening visit, are able to gargle, and can be 
followed for 28 days. CHG oral rinse will be used twice daily for 7 days total.  
Our primary outcome is S. aureus  eradicatio n at 7 days (test of cure (TOC)). Secondary outcome 
is eradication at 1 month (long term follow up). Study staff will administer surveys to subjects and/or their 
parents about risk factors hypothesized to  predict treatment success. S econdary outcomes inclu de safety, 
tolerability, and adherence to oral CHG.  We will also examine predictors of eradication, including pathogen 
level factors . Pathogen -level factors will be  examined using  S. aureus  whole genome sequencing , which will 
allow us to quantify the presence or  acquisition  of the qacA/B gene, which is associated with CHG 
resistance . WGS will also allow us determine if stains associated with persistence after CHG use represent 
pre-existing colonizing strains or acquisition of new strains.  
If CHG oral rinse is efficacious at eradication , our findings will form the foundation for a larger, 
more comprehensive intervention to prevent recurrent SSTIs  in children . If CHG oral rinse cannot 
decolonize the oropharynx , then investigations may need to focus on other strategies to prevent  S. aureus  
disease . Regardless  of results , our trial will forward  the field of prevention of this extremely common and 
potentially deadly infection.Scientific

Describe the medical problem as it relates to children  
• Community -associated (CA) Staphylococcus aureus , including  methicillin -resistant S. aureus  
(MRSA), is the most common ly identified  cause of skin  and soft tissue  infections  (SSTIs).  
and affects  children disproportionately . 
 
State the incidence/prevalence of problem in children  
• Four in 100 children in the U.S. will experience a SSTI  annually , resulting in over one million 
infections  annually , a problem further complicated in that  over 50% of children who have a S. 
aureus skin infection will develop a recurrent infection.  
 
Background that will lead to the research gap ( may use 2 sentences )  
• Our group found that, despi[INVESTIGATOR_789715], the most common site of colonization of S. 
aureus on th e human body is not the anterior nares (nose), but the orophary nx. There are 
mounting data that decolonization regimens that do not eradicate oropharyngeal colonization 
are ineffective at preventing recurrent S. aureus  SSTIs. 
 
State the primary research gap this study will address  
• Because trials on prevention of recurrent S. aureus  infections have been disappointing, w e 
will examine the efficacy of  orophary ngeal S. aureus  decolonization with 0.12% chlorhexidine 
gluconate (CHG)  oral rinse , a widely available commercial product with an excellent safety 
profile .  
 
Hypotheses  
• Oral CHG rinse (0.12%)  will be more effective than placebo at eradiating  S. aureus  
orophary ngeal colonization  after treatment completion . 
 
Specific Aims  
• To determine if CHG oral rinse can decolonize S. aureus  orophary ngeal colonization  better 
than placebo  in children. 
 
Study design  
• Randomized, prospective, double- blind , placebo -controlled clinical trial  of 0.12% CHG oral 
rinse vs. placebo oral rinse to decolonize the oropharynx among children.  
 
Describe study population or sample material  
• Subjects 5-[ADDRESS_1087821] confirmed colonization of the orophary nx with S. 
aureus and who are able to garg le. 
 
Sample size/power of primary endpoint  
• The primary endpoint is eradication of S. aureus  orophary ngeal colonization. To have 85% 
power to detect a 40% absolute difference in eradication between groups (10% for placebo and 50% for CHG), we will require 5 4 subjects total who complete the trial.  We will need to 
screen potentially eligible children with rapid molecular tests for S. aureus  oropharyngeal  
colonization to  find eligible subjects . Estimating 25% of screened children will be eligible , and 
accounting for a 10% attrition  rate, we will need to enroll [ADDRESS_1087822] to clinical applicability  
• A randomized, prospective, multi- center, clinical trial of children of prevention of  S. aureus  
skin infection that includes CHG oral rinses  (in addition to body and nasal disinfectants ) with 
a comparator group that will depend on standard of care at the time of development of the 
clinical trial protocol.

  Tested 	
  
 
Our primary  hypothesis is 0.12% CHG  oral rinse will be superior to placebo at  eradicating  S. aureus  from 
the oro pharynx  of children age [ADDRESS_1087823] several s econdary hypothes es: a) decolonization of oropharyngeal S. aureus  colonization  with 
0.12% CHG will be sustained at 28 days; b)  recolonization of the oropharynx will come from isolates that 
colonize patients nose and not from development of antimicrobial resistance, including the emergence of 
CHG -resistant S. aureus  strains that cont ain the qac A/B genes ; and c)  predictors of failure to decolonize 
with CHG will include poor treatment adherence, nasal S. aureus  colonization, a nd younger age . 
 
If our primary hypothesis is correct , findings will form the foundation for a larger, randomized, prospective, 
multi -center, placebo -controlled clinical trial comparing skin , nasal , and oropharyngeal  decolonization  vs. 
standard of care decolonization regimen for the prevention of recurrent S. aureus  skin infections . If oral 
CHG rinse is una ble to decolonize the oropharynx , then other more aggressive oropharyngeal S. aureus  
colonization eradication strategies in children will need to be tested.

  Specific	
  Aim(s)	
  of	
  the	
  Project 	
  
	
  
1) Determine the efficacy of oropharyngeal decolonization among children with a history of  CA-
MRSA , CA-S. aur eus or skin and soft tissue infection  (SSTI). To determine if orophary ngeal S. aureus  
colonization can be eradicated, we will perform a randomized , double blind placebo -controlled controlled 
clinical trial comparing  0.12% oral chlorhexidine (CHG) oral rinse  to placebo among children age 5 -17 with 
S. aureus  orophary ngeal colonization. We hypothesize that 0.12% CHG rinse will reduce oral S. aureus 
colonization better than placebo treatment. Our findings will provide “proof of principle” data on the ability of 
oral antiseptics to eradicate orophary ngeal S. aureus  colonization in children.  
 
2) Assess the safety, tolerability, and compliance of orophary ngeal decolonization among children 
and their caregivers. Using a structured instrument, w e will survey trial participants and their 
parents/guardi ans on side effects, tolerability , and adherence of the 0.12% oral CHG rinse and placebo . 
Findings will serve as a counterpoint to any benefits derived from oral decolonization . 
 
3) Determine the S. aureus  genetic backgrounds associated with breakthrough oropharyngeal 
colonization. We will molecularly characterize all baseline S. aureus isolates and “breakthrough” (failure) 
isolates using whole genome sequencing (WGS)  for key S. aureus  molecular markers , including emergence 
of S. aureus  isolates with the qacA/B gene , which is associated with CHG resistance .

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are an extremely common cause of visits to healthcare 
practitioners. Among U.S. children, there are over 2 million visits to doctors’ office and emergency 
departments annually for SSTIs .1 SSTIs can results in significant morbidity, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], bacteremia, and 
death. Children are disproportionately affected by S. aureus  SSTIs in the U.S., with a relative risk of  1.51 
[1.19 -1.92]  higher relative risk compared to adults.[ADDRESS_1087824] of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_789716] $[ADDRESS_1087825] Century , there has b een a dramatic rise  methicillin -resistant S. aureus  
(MRSA) incidence . Between [ADDRESS_1087826] common identified cause of SSTIs is Staphylococcus aureus6 and t he majority of CA-
MRSA skin infections in the U.S. are  caused by S. aureus  isolates from the [LOCATION_003]300 genetic background. 
This strain is particularly problematic  as it is associated with high rates of household transmission and 
recurrent disease .7 Approximately 20 -70% of children with a S. aureus SSTI will develop a recurrent 
infection in the following year.8 And approximately 13% of hou sehold contacts of persons with CA -MRSA 
will experience a similar skin infection in the subsequent [ADDRESS_1087827].12 In one military study, 38% 
(9/24) o f recruits who were nasally MRSA colonized suffered a subsequent SSTI in the next 2 months 
compared  to 3% (8/229) with MSSA colonization (P <0.001).13 In a study of ambulatory children,  Fritz et al. 
found that 32% (7/22) o f children who were nasally MRSA colonized suffered a subsequent SSTI in the next 
12 months compared  to 10% (14/142) with MSSA colonization and 9% (33/370) in those without baseline S. 
aureus colonization (P=0.03).[ADDRESS_1087828] involved 
combined nasal and skin decontamination. For example, Fritz et al. randomized children with SSTIs to 
either skin d ecolonization  with chlorhexidine  (CHG) and nasal decolonization with mupi[INVESTIGATOR_789717] + mupi[INVESTIGATOR_789718].8 While decolonization the 
whole house hold was superior (54% SSTI recurrence rate vs. 72%  during the 12 month follow up period ), 
the trial had disappointing results in that even in the more aggressively treated group, recurrence ra tes of 
SSTIs in the affected children exceeded 52%. The results suggest that even skin and nasal decolonization 
is insufficient to prevent recurrent SSTIs in children. Another recent study by [CONTACT_28981]. randomized 
children with  SSTIs, most caused  by [CONTACT_28474]-S. aureus  infections to bleach baths versus routine daily hygienic 
measures.16 Unfortunately, the skin decolonization afforded by [CONTACT_789752] a decrease 
rate of recurrent SSTIs  compared with routine daily hygienic me asures (17% vs. 21%, P=0.15) .[ADDRESS_1087829] common body site of S. aureus  colonization on the human body is 
not the anterior nares (nose) but the orophary nx.18 In this study, conducted in Los Angeles and Chicago, 
30% of household contacts  were colonized with S. aureus in the oropharynx, but on 25% in the nares. 
9 
 
 
  Among thi s subset of 268 household contacts of persons with CA -MRSA skin infection, 31% were 
oropharyngeally colonized with S. aureus, but on 23% in the nares.  Orophary ngeal S. aureus colonization 
has been found in other populations  with a prevalence  similar or higher than nasal colonization .17-[ADDRESS_1087830] -eradication re -colonization and recurrent S. aureus disease.  
 Chlorhexidi ne gluconate (CHG) is an ideal treatment for eradication of S. aureus on the skin and the 
oropharynx . CHG has been safely used for bathing, showering and dental hygiene for over [ADDRESS_1087831] as a 4% topi[INVESTIGATOR_789719]. CHG is associated with  marked reductions in skin bacteria following serial CHG 
bathing or showering,20-[ADDRESS_1087832] of who  were elderly, with S. 
aureus infection or colonization after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85636] S. aureus . In this investigation,  oral CHG rinses 
eradicate d over 50% of S. aureus  oropharyngeal colonization compared to no oral CHG rinses  (no placebo 
was used in this study) .19 No data on CHG oral rinses for S. aureus colonization are available in children  
and examination of recolonization after a course of oral CHG rinses are lacking.  
 One concern with antibiotic use is the emergence of antibiotic resistance.  Decreased susceptibility to 
CHG in S. aureus has been recently associated with a plasmid -mediated biocide resistance gene qac A/B, 
which encodes an energy -dependent export system that pumps chlorhexidine from the bacterial cell.30 
Although the clinical significance is not fully elucidated  with large studies , qac A/B has been identified in a 
small percent of S. aureus  isolates  in the US, Europe , and Asia  and there is interest in correlating the 
presence  of the qac A/B  gene  with clinical outcomes, such as failure to eradicate colonization .30-34 In a 
recent investigation among adults and children with SSTI , 1% of adults and children  with SSTIs harbor the 
qac A/B  gene.35 Another study of 281 MRSA isolates from a children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 18.5% harbor ed the qac 
A/B gene ,36 suggesting that prevalence of this resistance gene among S. aureus  may be high in selected 
populations . There are no data  about the emergence  qac A/B  containing  S. aureus  after exposure to CHG 
products.  Because of the  concern  of emerging resistance in trials  of antibiotic  treatment37 studies  using 
CHG products for decolonization purposes should  to perform careful monitoring for the development of 
resistance .33,38,[ADDRESS_1087833] such an

Oropharyngeal  colonization is common but its role as a predictor of recurrent SSTIs is unexplored  
The body site of greatest S. aureus  colonization has traditionally been believed to be the anterior 
nares.40,41 S. aureus  has be en known to colonize the axilla , perineum, rectum, vagi na, and the throat 
(oropharynx) .42-[ADDRESS_1087834] data regarding the importance and scale of non-nasal 
colonization been appreciated .42-45 An investigation conducted by [CONTACT_789753] S. aureus  SSTIs cultured at the anterior nares, oropharynx, and 
inguinal region, S. aureus colonized 40% (137/350) and 50% (405/812) of their household contacts.[ADDRESS_1087835] missed 48% of S. aureus  and 51% of MRSA colonized persons.18 Among the 
subset of patie nts with CA -MRSA infection, the proportion of oropharyngeal -only colonization was 12%, 
suggesting nasal -only screening for S. aureus  colonization misses a sizable proportion of colonized patients 
with community onset SSTI. In fact oropharyngeal colonizatio n was more prevalent  than nasal colonization 
(26.0% vs. 24.0 %) in our cohort of >[ADDRESS_1087836] 
employed mupi[INVESTIGATOR_789720] (or bleach).8,[ADDRESS_1087837] are 
from adults, largely elderly adults;[ADDRESS_1087838] that the oropharynx  can be  reservoir of S. aureus  colonization . 
 Traditional methods to eradicate S. aureus  colonization in the skin and nose do not appear  to 
eradicate oropharyngeal colonization. In a Dutch study, two hospi[INVESTIGATOR_789721] (skin) and nasal decolonization regimens. However, this traditional regimen, similar to regimens used for eradication of children with S. aureus  infections, did not eradicate pharyngeal S. 
aureus colonization.
56 Only after systemic eradication with oral antibiotics was performed, were these 
persons’ throats decolonized. The authors suggested that MRSA throat (oropharyngeal) colonization might 
be a reason why MRSA eradication fails in otherwise healthy persons .[ADDRESS_1087839] CLEAR,60 is an  ongoing trial of decolonization of recently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_789722] S. 
aureus infection and/or colonization . In this  ongoing clinical trial of over [ADDRESS_1087840] of care (education) or decolonization with nasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190], topi[INVESTIGATOR_789723], and 
11 
 
 
  0.12% oropharyngeal CHG oral rinse . Data from the first 976  subjects demonstrated that oropharyngeal 
colonization decreased over 50% (from a baseline of 2 1% to 10%)  by 1 month  with only a 22% to 19% 
decrease in the control group (P<0.05) . (Figure 1) This data provides proof of principle that oropharyngeal 
S. aureus  can be eradicated with 0.12% chlorhexidine. However data  in other populations, especially  
children , are lacking.  It is important to investigate S. aureus  oropharyngeal eradication in children given 
results of studies in adults cannot simply be generalized or extrapolated to children, and adolescents.61 
 
 
Rapid diagnostic testing can identify 
extra- nasal S. aureus  colonization  
 To identify children and patients 
with oropharyngeal colonization  who are to 
be target for decolonization , a simple and 
rapid identification system is required.  
Several r apid molecular diagnostic 
technologies to directly identify S. aureus , 
including MRSA, for the detection of S. 
aureus in oropharyngeal and nares 
specim ens. Rapid molecular S. aureus  tests 
employ real -time polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) technology that targets spa , 
mecA , and SCC mec genes found in MRSA. 
They have a turn -around- time of ~ [ADDRESS_1087841] these rapid molecular tests are of high clinical utility. 
Our group has used rapid molecular tests to identify patients with extra -nasal (inguinal) colonization.[ADDRESS_1087842] used rapid molecular tests for identifying S. aureus oropharyngeal colonization .49,64 
 Whole genome sequencing  has high level discriminatory power to distinguish small changes 
among S. aureus  isolates  
 With advances in sequencing technologies and the availability of large computing power and 
bioinformatics, whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) is becoming a method of choice to characterize emerging 
phenotypes and virulent subtypes of microbial pathogens. A comparative WGS can identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indels, small genetic rearrangements, and the acquisition and loss of 
mobile genetic elements in S. aureus  strains associated with disease phenotypes.
67 WGS  can distinguish 
differences in strains that cannot be appreciated by [CONTACT_789754] (PFGE), multilocus sequence typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (MLST), and spa typi[INVESTIGATOR_007],68-[ADDRESS_1087843] recurrence of colonization or 
failures of decolonization regimens.  Given the very high discriminatory power of WGS for S. aureus , and the 
observation that colonizing strains within a given individual even with l ow discriminatory ability are 
frequently different,18 we hypothesize that in patients using CHG oral rinses, isolates that are associated 
with recolonization after initial decolonization success will represent new strains or be related to nasal

(skin) chlorhexidine, and orophayngeal chlorhexidine  
[ADDRESS_1087844] behind a critical reservoir of S. aureus . This reservoir can then serve as a persistent 
source of S. aureus colonization that can be the nidus for subsequent infections. Because recurrence  rates 
of S. aureus  skin infection are so high, there is an urgent need to study the efficacy of oropharyngeal 
decolonization regimens for S. aureus in children before they can be used in more compre hensive 
decolonization regimens.

This investigation is a r andomized, prospective, multi -center, placebo -controlled clinical trial  to 
examine eradication of S. aureus  from the oropharynx  of children age [ADDRESS_1087845] proven oropharyngeal  S. aureus colonization. We will compare eradication of oropharyngeal  
S. aureus  colonization  among those randomized to oral chlorhexidine (C HG) oral rinse compared to those 
randomized to placebo . Our investigative team has ex perience in S. aureus  treatment and prevention, 
Pediatrics, Infectious Diseases, Emergency Medicine , Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Infectious Diseases 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and Health Services Research. We have ample experience enrolling subjects in the Pediatric 
Emergency Department (P ED) setting. Over the last [ADDRESS_1087846]. Miller’s group has enrolled over 3, [ADDRESS_1087847] collaborated on a National Institutes of Health (NIH) multi -
center clinical trial comparing TMP -SMX and clindamycin for  the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections 
in children and adults  in the ambulatory care setting .[ADDRESS_1087848]. Miller for over seven  
years on multiple  federally -sponsored investigations including  clinical trials sponsored by [CONTACT_133815], Centers 
for Disease  Control and 
Prevention (CDC) , and the 
Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality 
(AHRQ).  18,75,[ADDRESS_1087849] them with the

team. The study ac tivities  
and milestones  are outlined  
in Figure 2. 
 
 
Enrollment of a cohort of pediatric patients  with S. aureus  skin and soft tissue infection 
 
Enrollment  
We will enroll 240 subjects with a history of SSTI in the Pediatric Emergency Department  (PED) at 
Harbor -UCLA Medical Center . Subject s who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined below will 
undergo rapid screening for oropharyngeal S. aureus  colonization. Assuming a 25% oropharyngeal 
colonization prevalence,[ADDRESS_1087850] oropharyngeal  coloniz ation  with a S. aureus  and be eligible 
for the trial’s decolonization regimen  (Figure 3) .  

13 
 
 
  All patients  who participate in the 
clinical trial will be followed for 28 days  for 
the purpose of determining which  
subjects  achieve and maintain 
eradication . Participants will be enrolled 
regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender. 
While younger children commonly suffer 
from SSTIs , for this investigation we will 
only enroll children  5 years of age and 
older, as younger children may not be able to gargle . In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 64 
children  from a general dentistry practice  
asked to gargle , among the 12 children 
ages 3 -4, only 2  (17%) could complete a 
30 second gargle, whereas 51/52 (98%) 
of those ages 5 -8 could gargle 
successfully ( Mitra Evans, DDS, personal 
correspondence).   
 To recruit subjects , study 
coordinators will screen the PED three 
times  daily. During screening , they will 
query PED physicians , and nursing staff about potentially interested  patients (e.g., those with a history of 
SSTIs) whose parents/guardians are willing to discuss possible  participation in a study. PED staff will also 
be in -serviced about the study and encouraged by [CONTACT_789755] -Investigator  to call study 
coordinators as needed. To complement these efforts, flye rs will be placed in the PED advertising to 
medical staff to call or page study coordinators about potentially eligible patients . These strateg ies have 
been highly successfully at each of the sites for enrolling subjects with SSTIs in the PED for our previous 
investigations. Once an interested patient is identified, the study coordinator will complete the informed 
consent process in a private setting in the patient’s  parent/guardian  preferred language (English or 
Spanish).  
 
Inclusion and Exclusion criteria  
For this investigation, we will use strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria will include:  
a) History of skin or soft tissue infection, as per patient report  
b) Age >
 5 years and < 18 years.  
c) Able to gargle  (if needed , ability to gargle  can be assessed at screening using water ). 
d) Willing and a ble to undergo nares and oropharyngeal  swabbing.  
e) Able to come to the research clinic for study follow -up visits for the study period.  
 Exclusion criteria for subjects will include: 
a) Suspected or confirmed infection requiring systemic antibiotics . 
b) Receipt of s ystemic antibiotics in the prior 28 days.  
c) Plans for administration or likely receipt of systemic antibiotics in the next 28 days  (e.g., if the patient 
suffers from recurrent infections such as otitis media  or has a planned surgery that requires 
prophylactic antibiotics ). 
d) Plans for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_789724] 28 days (e.g., if the patient su ffers from 
recurrent infections ). 
e) Any of the following in the prior 6 months: hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, central venous catheter placement, and systemic chemotherapy for cancer , any immune compromising condition . These 
criteria ensure that subjects enrolled with have CA -S. aureus  infections and are likely coloniz ed with 
[LOCATION_003]300 S. aureus , the most common cause of SSTIs in the U.S .  
f) Previous participation in the study.

assistant will then process the swab for rapid molecular testing (GeneXpert MRSA/SA platform) to 
determine if the purulent fl uid has MRSA, MSSA,  or neither. T he sensitivity and specificity of this FDA 
approved assay in the nares are 97 and 96%, respectively ;65 sensitivity for throat specimens is 75% -81% 
with a very high sensitivity of 98%.87,88 The specimen will be processed in the Miller Laboratory on the 
Harbor -UCLA Medical Center campus, which is a <[ADDRESS_1087852] positive for S. aureus  
and later using clinical microbiology lab testing with culture -based methods are found to be negative for S. 
aureus will not be included in the analysis , although g iven the very high sensitivity of the GeneXpert assay 
in throat specimens (98%), we think t his is an unlikely event87 and these events are built into our expected 
attrition rate (see below). For ethical purposes, all subjects, regardless of rapid testing results, will receive 
educational materials regarding optimal hygienic practices to reduce risk of transmission, basic  education 
about S. aureus , SSTI, and recognition of warning signs of serious skin infections . These materials were 
developed for previous investigations and available in English and Spanish.  
 Based on previous investigations of patients with a history of  skin infection from our group,18 we 
estimate 33% of children with a history of SSTIs will be positive for S. aureus (n=80, Figure 2). Assuming a 
75% sensitivity of the GeneXpert assay, and 75% of those participants (n=60) will be positive at the 
oropharynx (see section on Power and Sample size, below). Study coordinators will complete the baseline visit for participants who are S. aureus  positive on rapid molecular testing.  
Subjects will also be swabbed for S. aureus  and MRSA colonization at the anterior nares and 
oropharynx. Testing will be performed using two methods: direct microbiology cultures and rapid molecular 
testing. Microbiologic cultures will be performed by [CONTACT_789756] S. aureus 
and MRSA carriage will be transported to the research microbiology laboratory at LA BioMed at Harbor -
UCLA and plated within 24 hours of collection. Swabs will be processed for S. aureus  using blood agar and 
CHROMagar plates for rapid identificati on of S. aureus and MRSA. All S. aureus  and MRSA isolates will be 
banked for pulse -field typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], determination of SCC mec type, and presence of the PVL locus ( lukF-PV and 
lukS-PV). Rapid molecular testing will be performed using the GeneXpert MRSA/SA platform, which is 
currently available at our site .  
Upon confirmation of eligibility, the study coordinators will call the pharmacy to randomize the 
participant and obtain the oral rinse.  The randomization assignment list will be generated in advance by 
[CONTACT_966].  Randomization procedures by [CONTACT_789757] a computer method. To 
ensure adequate balance of subjects between the CHG and placebo groups, treatment allocation will be 
assigned using a random number generation with randomiza tion of blocks of four subjects each. The 
randomization list will be kept by [CONTACT_789758]. The research pharmacists will dispense the appropriate oral rinse t o 
the participant and their parent/guardian.  Placebo will be created using  the inert vehicles components of 
CHG, as has been done previously.
89 Participants and their parent/guardian will be given detailed 
instructions on the use of the oral rinse both verbally and in a handout in either English or Spanish as 
preferred by [CONTACT_728875]/guardian.  
Subjects randomized to oral  CHG will be provided verbal and written instruction on use of CHG oral 
rinse . Subjects will be asked to use CHG oral rinse  twice daily for 7 day s. Subjects will be educated to rinse 
their mouth and gargle with CHG oral rinse for 60 seconds twice  a day. Subjects will be instructed to use a 
watch or other timing device (e.g., smartphone)  to ensure that at least [ADDRESS_1087853] elapses. Research 
staff will demonstrate the technique for all subjects using drinking water. All subjects randomized to the 
CHG ar m will be provided a new soft bristle  toothbrush to prevent recontamination of the oropharynx with S. 
aureus from a contaminated toothbrush. Subjects randomized to usual care will not be provided with any of 
the above.  Regardless of treatment allocation, study staff will educate all subjects ’ parent/guardian, and 
subject (if of sufficient age)  with the clinical significance of the results  of their positive  test for oropharyngeal 
[ADDRESS_1087854] concern that oral rinses/ gargling with placebo or an inert substance may affect S. aureus colonization. 
However, a [ADDRESS_1087855] information about demographics, 
medical history, antibiotic use, and behavioral risk factors  for S. aureus  infection and colonization. 
Participants and their parent/guardian will be given phone numbers of the study coordinator for questions. 
Participants and their parent/guardian will be compensated for their time for this and all study visits.  
 Follow- up visits  
 Participants will be asked to come to the research clinic 7 days after initiation of oral CHG, i.e., at the 
end of their treatment (Visit 2) . A subsequent visit will occur  at 28 days (Visit 3 ). The purpose of these visits 
is to ascertain oropharyngeal eradication of S. aureus  both short term (primary study outcome) and longer 
term. Based on previous investigations conducted at our center(s), we estimate a 10% attrition 
rate.75,77,78,81,82 At Visit 2, participants  will be swabbed the nares and oro pharynx for the presence of S. 
aureus and to complete  a follow -up survey about any recurrent  infections , new medical history, or receipt of 
antibiotics . At Visit 3, participants  will return to the research clinic to complete a follow -up survey. Study staff 
will also call all subjects remind them of their upcoming study appointments  and at days 14 and 21 to 
address any questions the participant or their parent/guardian may have ab out the study . Adverse events 
will be measured at each scheduled and unscheduled (see below) follow -up visits. Adverse events will be 
measured using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA) version 14.0 or 
later terms .  
 
Unsche duled visits  
 If participants or their parent/guardian experience potential  adverse drug events  that occur during 
the follow up period , subjects or their  parent/guardian will  be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_464]. If the event 
may be of clinical concern,  the event will be referred to  a study physician and the oral rinse discontinued , if 
applicable . If deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_789759] ’ primary physician , participants will 
be asked to return to the research clinic for evaluation by a study investigator.  
 
Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of oropharyngeal decolonization among children suffering from CA -
MRSA and other S. aureus  skin infections  
To determine if orophary ngeal S. aureus  colonization can be eradicated, we will perform a prospective, 
double blind randomized controlled clinical trial of 0.12% oral chlorhexidine (CHG) oral rinse  versus placebo 
for children age 5 -17 with S. aureus  orophary ngeal colonization. We hypothesize that 0.12% CHG rinse will 
16 
 
 
  reduce oral S. aureus  colonization better than placebo treatment. The findings from this Aim will provide 
“proof of principle” data on the ability of oral antiseptics to eradicate orophary ngeal S. aureus  colonization in 
children. 
 
Power  and Sample Size  
Using an alpha of 0.05 and expected cure rates of 50% and 10% in the CHG and placebo arms 
respectively, 54 subjects (27 per group) would be needed for 85% power to detect a 40% absolute difference i n cure (p<0.05) between groups.  Correcting for a 10% attrition rate, 60 enrolled subjects would 
be needed. To identify 60 subjects with oropharyngeal colonization, and assuming 33% of patients who are high risk for S. aureus  colonization will have orophar yngeal colonization, 240 subjects will need to be 
screened to obtain 80 patients that are oropharyngeally colonized with S. aureus . Of these, 75% (n=60) will 
have S. aureus  detected by [CONTACT_789760].  
 
Data Analyses  and Data and Safety Monitoring  
The decolonization  rate will be calculated as the number of subjects who remain decolonized  divided 
by [CONTACT_14458], and treatment group differences as differences in these rates. The precision of 
estimated rates and rate differences will be expressed with two -sided confidence intervals calculated as 
asymptotically normal approximations to binomial or differences  in binomial random variables. The level of 
confidence for these intervals will be 95%. Statistical sign ificance for differences between treatment groups 
in cure rates will be determi ned from Fisher’s exact tests. The level of significance for these tests is 0.05.  
Factors associated with failure of decolonization in the CHG treatment group will also be exami ned. Based 
on prior investigations of S. aureus colonization from our group and others, these will include demographics 
(age, gender, race/ethnicity), co -morbidities, measures of hygiene, number of prior skin infections in the 
prior year, antibiotic use in  the prior year, household history of skin infection, adverse effects and tolerability 
(see Aim 2, below), and treatment adherence. Additionally, we will examine pathogen level predictors of decolonization failure, based on molecular characterization of ba seline isolates (see Aim 3). These factors 
will include baseline colonization with [LOCATION_003]300 strain, presence of qac A/B gene, presence of nasal colonization, presence of nasal colonization with a strain identical to the oropharyngeal colonizing strain, 
and presence of nasal colonization with a strain differing from the oropharyngeal colonizing strain. 
Associations will be examined using Chi -squared, Fisher Exact test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, or T -test, as 
appropriate. Small sample size will preclude multivari able analyses of factors independently associated with 
failure to decolonize. This analysis will be key to identifying factors associated with decolonization failures. 
Identification of mutable factors associated with decolonization failure will be key tow ards improving the 
success of future efforts at oropharyngeal eradication of S. aureus. Identification of non -mutable factors will 
be key towards identifying groups that may need more intense intervention and or education.  
 Given this investigation is min imal risk, Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) will be performed by [CONTACT_789761]. DSM will be performed according to standards of The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National 
Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Policy for Data & Safety Mo nitoring .
[ADDRESS_1087856] to follow up, adverse events (AEs), 
and serious adverse events (SAEs) (See Aim 2, below for further details). Subjects that report treatment 
related adverse events will dis continue the oral rinse and come to the research clinic for an unscheduled 
visit. 
 Aim 2:  Assess the safety, tolerability, and compliance of oropharyngeal decolonization among 
children and their caregivers. We will administer a detai led and systematic survey of side effects, 
tolerability and compliance of the orophary ngeal decolonization regimen to determine the effects, concerns, 
and usability of this regimen in children for both the child participants and their parent s/caregivers. Findings 
will identify adverse effects and barriers to use to be considered when possibly administering this regimen in the future.  
Data Analyses  
Adverse events will be coded to a Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology 
(MedDRA) version [ADDRESS_1087857] data listings. A separate listing sorted 
17 
 
 
  by [CONTACT_789762]. 
Data for adverse events will be analyzed using the treatment -emergent signs and symptoms philosophy.   
 
Treatment emergent signs and symptoms are defined as adverse events where:  
• onset occurs dur ing exposure to study medication or within [ADDRESS_1087858] dose of study 
medication, having been absent prior to receiving study medication, or  
• onset reoccurs during exposure to study medication or within [ADDRESS_1087859] dose of study 
medica tion, having been present but stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_789725], or  
• worsening in severity occurs during exposure to study medication relative to the pre -treatment state, 
when the adverse event is continuous.  
 All reported adverse events (regar dless of treatment -emergent or not) will be included in a by -subject 
adverse event listing. Only treatment -emergent adverse events will be included in summary tables. The 
number of subjects (incidence) of treatment -emergent adverse events will be presented  as well as the 
frequency of all adverse events reported.  
 
Summary tables of adverse events will include the following:  
• Summary of adverse events by [CONTACT_42564]  
• Summary of related adverse events  
• Summary of Serious adverse events  
• A listing of any on -study pregnancies  
 
Percentages of subjects who reported adverse events will each be compared separately among each group 
using Chi -Square or Fisher Exact tests, as appropriate . 
 
Aim 3:  Determine the S. aureus  genetic backgrounds associated with breakthrough oropharyngeal 
colonization.  
Advances in sequencing technologies and the availability of large computing power and bioinformatics  have 
allowed WGS to become the  method of choice to characterize emerging  phenotypes.
72 WGS also allows 
examination of the relationship between presence of the qac A/B gene in S. aureus  at baseline and 
treatment response. WGS allows detection of this plasmid -based resistance gene for comparative analysis 
among a subset of S. aureus  isolates from our population, as described below.  
We will molecularly characterize all baseline S. aureus isolates and “breakthrough” (failure) isolates 
using whole genome sequencing (WGS) for identification of breakthrough S. aureus  isolates. We will 
compare break through isolates with baseline nasal and orophangyeal isolates to determine if breakthrough 
isolates represent either: a) recolonization with the original oropharyngeal isolate, b) recolonization with the 
baseline nasal isolate, or c) acquisition of a new S. aureus  strain. Additionally, we will investigate whether S. 
aureus associated with treatment failures have acquired or possess the qac A/B gene.   
 
Sample Size 
Data Analyses  
WGS will be done in the laboratory of Barry Kreiswirth, PhD (see Letter of Support), using 
established techniques.92,93 [CONTACT_789769]’s lab has ample experience performing WGS on S. aureus  and 
other bacterial pathogens .92-94 [CONTACT_789770]’s lab will also supply analytic support to assist with 
interpretation of findings.  
WGS sequencing will addresses several hypothesis in those subjects randomized to CHG oral 
rinses, specifically: a) strains that are found in the oro pharynx at end of treatment (Day 7) will be identical 
genetically to those at baseline and not represent acquisition of new S. aureus  strain; b) recolonizing S. 
aureus strains at Day 28 among subjects successfully eradicated at Day 7 will represent (re)col onization 
with the original isolate that colonized the nasopharynx from the same individual (if present at baseline) or a 
new S. aureus  strain not present at baseline and; c) nasal isolates found at baseline and follow up will be 
identical to synchronously  identified oropharyngeal S. aureus  isolates.  
18 
 
 
  Based on data in older adults,19 we estimate that of the 30 subjects randomized to the CHG arm, 
50% will be decolonized, leaving 15 subjects who will be S. aureus  positive at the oropha rynx at the end of 
treatment. Based on data of re colonization  after decolonization in which recolonization can occur after the 
decolonization regimen is completed,10 we estimate that a 10% increase in colonization wi ll be seen at Day 
28, i.e., [ADDRESS_1087860] results in 33 pairs of oropharynx isolates (15 between baseline and Day 7, and 18 between baseline 
and Day 28, for a total of 66 isolates total). Additionally we will conduct whole genome sequencing on 
baseline nasal S. aureus  isolates associated with the subsequent oropharynx isolates identified at Day 7 
and/or Day 28. Based on previous data suggesting that ~45% of those colonized at the oropharynx will be 
colonized at the anterior nares,18,46,95 we estimate an additional 30 (45% x 66) nasal S. aureus isolates from 
baseline and follow -up will be present synchronously with oropharyngeal isolates.  
In total 96 isolates will undergo whole genome analysis to address the hypotheses outlined abov e. 
Specifically, we will examine if decolonization failure of the oropharynx is due to any of the following: 1) a 
new and distinct S. aureus strain; 2) an isolate found at the nares at baseline; 3) an isolate found in the 
oropharynx at baseline; or 4) an i dentical strain from baseline but that has acquired with new resistance 
genes to CHG, specifically qac A/B . WGS typi[INVESTIGATOR_789726] S. aureus isolates also allows us to 
determine if “breakthrough” oropharyngeal strains at Day 7 and/or [ADDRESS_1087861] in 
determination if resistance genes to CHG, specifically qac A/B , emerged after treatment in non -
oropharyngeal, specifically nares  sites, as it is known that antimicrobial therapy is associated with collateral 
damage among strains not specifically targeted by [CONTACT_789763].37 I.e., oral CHG may result in the 
emergence of qac A/B  containing S. aureus  strain in the nares. Analytically, the above analyses will be 
descriptive thus there are no power calculations for this aim.   
 
Limitations  
 This investigation is limited as it is a single center study. However, our center serves a ethnically  and 
socioeco nomically diverse population and findings from our investigations have been comparable to similar 
investigations in other populations.18,96,97 Our intervention is also singular in decolonization efforts 
(oropharynx o nly). However, no investigation has looked at the effect of S. aureus eradication on the 
oropharynx in children, so the addition of other decolonizing agents would prevent us from determining the 
efficacy of CHG oral rinse. Additionally, our trial is a “pr oof of principle” study that is required prior to a more 
comprehensive trial on S. aureus  decolonization as a means for SSTI prevention. Finally, we are not 
performing WGS typi[INVESTIGATOR_789727] S. aureus  isolates at all study time points, as it is known  that S. 
aureus can colonize not only the nares and oropharynx, but the axilla, inguinal fold, perirectal area, vagina, 
and areas of skin that have lost integrity.42,47,98,[ADDRESS_1087862] commonly found (nares, oropharynx).  
 
Future Directions  
Investigation on  prevention of recurrent S. aureus  SSTI have been extremely disappointing, 
suggesting more comprehensive decolonization regimens need to be developed, especially those that focus 
on sites of colonization not previously targeted in clinical trials. Our inve stigation will be the first study to 
examine the efficacy of CHG to eradicate S. aureus  from the oropharynx of children. [CONTACT_10017] and his team 
provide ample experience in the area of MRSA infection and colonization, infectious disease expertise, 
clinical  trials, and pediatrics. Besides the aims addressed for this investigation, our team is poised to 
address future aims related to S. aureus decolonization efforts and SSTI recurrences by [CONTACT_789764]. In summary, the results of this investigation will provide the critical 
foundation for the development of future clinical trials. Data generated from our investig ation will further 
investigative work on prevention of recurrent S. aureus  SSTIs, which remain an extremely common and 
vexing clinical problem for clinicians, and more importantly, patients.

For this investigation, Harbor -UCLA Medical Center pediatric emergency department  providers (MD, 
NPs) will refer patients agreeable to  being approached by [CONTACT_789765] . If patient 
and their  guardian are  agreeable,  research staff will approach patients and  initiate the informed consent 
process . If the patient and/or their parent or guardian consent and the patient is eligible , the patient will 
undergo the  first part  of the study  (oropharyngeal screening for S. aureus , which will be evaluated  using the 
GeneXpert platform ). Study staff will explain the study to the potential subject’s  parent or guardian.  The 
informed consent process will be conducted by a study team member  in their p referred language (English or 
Spanish) . Written informed consent will be sought, obtained , and documented by a research coordinator 
and the site’s PI [CONTACT_2329] a form approved by [CONTACT_8236]’s IRB . Subject’s who are capable will  participate in 
the informed consent process  and those [ADDRESS_1087863]’s older than 12 
will co- sign the consent form with their parent/legal guardian . The informed consent process will explicitly 
state that if the orophar yngeal screening for S. aureus  is positive, they agree to participate in the clinical trial 
and that if the oropharyngeal screening for S. aureus  is negative, they are not eligible for the clinical trial.  
All subjects who have  consented will have the rapid S. aureus  test performed with results shared  
with the subject’s parent/guardian, the subject, and the clinician , if approved by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian . Study 
staff will educate and the subject’s parent/guardian, and subject (if of sufficient age ), the clinical significance 
of the results, either positive or negative. More specifically, they will be educated that currently testing for S. 
aureus oropharyngeal colonization is considered experimental and that if the test is positive, the clinical 
signif icance is unclear. They will also be educated that tens of millions,  perhaps over [ADDRESS_1087864] will u ndergo 3 study visits total:  baseline /enrollment visit (Visit 
1), Day 7 (Visit 2), and Day 28 (Visit 3). Consenting subjects  will have their  anterior nares  and oropharynx 
swabbed at Visits 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_1087865] information about 
demographics, medical history, and behavioral risk factors for skin and soft tissue infection and coloni zation. 
Subjects will be randomized to 0.12% CHG oral rinse or placebo use for [ADDRESS_1087866] information about (late) adverse 
events, changes in household dynamics and individual behavior  (e.g., hygiene) that may affect  results of 
Visit 3 nasal and oropharyngeal colonization studies .  
Patients at Harbor -UCLA Medical Center come from a diverse racial and ethnic background, with 
approximately 51% Hispanic, 26% Caucasian, 18% African -American, and 6% “other ” (largely Asian and to 
a lesser extent, mixed race ). Two hundred and forty patients  are anticipated to be enrolled over [ADDRESS_1087867] confidentiality, which will be mitigated by [CONTACT_789766]/or on a password -protected computer file. This 
likelihood of subject confidentiality being b roken is minimal.  Risks to confidentiality will be protected by 
[CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_789728] a locked office with access restrict ed to study personnel. All identifiers will be 
removed and destroyed when data is l ogged into an Access database. We will protect against psychological 
risk to the patient by [CONTACT_789767], the risks, current treatments, the lack of acceptance of routine treatments, and the ability to 
attempt treatm ent in th e case of recurrent infections.  If a subject suffers psychological harm, they may 
contact [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_789729]. Subjects will be told that their 
information will not be shared with any persons except for  study personnel unless the subject provides 
[ADDRESS_1087868] on the care they will receive from their treating physicians o r at 
their treating institutions.  
 Risks associated with study medication  is believed to be minimal.  Chlorhexidine -gluconate (CHG) 
oral rinse is an FDA -approved medication for the treatment of gingivitis . The known side e ffects of oral CHG 
oral rinse  inclu de staining of teeth and other oral surfaces , an increase in calculus formation; and an 
alteration in taste perception .[ADDRESS_1087869] oral hygienic practices (e.g.,  tooth brushing ).  All subjects will be educated on 
the proper use of the oral r inse. Subjects will be asked to report any adverse events to study personnel and 
to stop the use of the oral rinse  if any severe side effects develop ( swelling , pain, etc. ). Staff will also be 
able to counsel subjects about the risks and benefits of the oral rinse  to decolonize the oropharynx . Study 
personnel will also have cell phones, which subjects can call to ask questions about the study, use of the 
intervention oral rins e, and report adverse events. Subjects that report serious adverse events or other 
medical needs will be referred to the Harbor -UCLA Medical Centers’ Pediatric E mergency Department.   
 
An Investigational New Drug (IND) application will not be required , as a  clinical investigation of a  
marketed  drug is exempt from IND requirements if  all of the criteria for an exemption in § 312.2(b) are met:  
 
• The drug product is lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002].  
• The investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well -controlled study in  support of a new 
indication and there is no intent  to use it to support  any other significant  change in the labeling of the 
drug.  
• In the case of a prescription drug, the investigation  is not intended to  support a significant  change in the 
advertising for the drug.  
• The investigation does not involve a route of  administration, dose,  patient population, or  other factor that 
significantly  increases the risk (or decreases  the acceptability of the risk)  associated with the use of th e 
drug product (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)).  
• The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by [CONTACT_2717]  (21 CFR part 
56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50).  
• The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements of § 312.7 (i.e., the  investigation is 
not intended to promote or commercialize the drug product).  
 
Because t he use of 0.12% CHG oral rinse in this investigation meets all of the above criteria for required 
for an IND exemption .  
 
Data and safety monitoring will be conducted as described in Aim 2.

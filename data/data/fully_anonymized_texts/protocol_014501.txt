CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 7 of 132 Template 18.03 Follow-up period: Safety, sustained efficacy, and the need for rescue therapy will be assessed in the 
follow-up period. Subjects will be required to apply moisturizers twice daily through to the end of the 
follow-up period at Visit 12 (Week 24), and will not be permitted to use TCSs and TCIs, except if 
medically necessary.
The primary analysis will occur once all subjects have either completed the Visit 10 (Week 16) assessments or 
have withdrawn from the study. The final analysis will occur when all subjects have completed the follow up period at Visit 12 (Week 24) or have withdrawn from the study.
TARGET SUBJECT POPULATION
Subjects aged 18 to 65 years inclusive with chronic, moderate-to-severe AD; with documented recent history of 
inadequate response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_635239], intolerance to treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_635239], or 
for whom topi[INVESTIGATOR_635240].
TREATMENT GROUPS AND REGIMENS
At Visit 3 (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomized to receive SC investigational product  
 as follows:
• MEDI3506 58 subjects),
• MEDI3506  (18 subjects),
• MEDI3506  (18 subjects),
• Placebo  (6 subjects), or
• Placebo  (52 subjects).
STATISTICAL METHODS
General Considerations:
The placebo  groups will be pooled for planned analyses, except where stated otherwise. 
Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_96776]. Continuous 
variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_635271], mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.The study populations that will be used in the reporting of the study include the intent-to-treat (ITT), As-treated,
and PK populations. The ITT population will be used to summarize demographic and baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, and efficacy endpoints. The As-treated population will be used to summarize safety 
endpoints (adverse events [AEs], laboratory tests, electrocardiograms [ECGs], left ventricular ejection fraction, 
and vital signs), and will be used for other endpoints unless otherwise stated. The PK population will be used to summarize PK endpoints.
Sample Size:
A sample size of 144 subjects in an over all 3:1:1:3 ratio of MEDI3506 :MEDI3506 :MEDI3506 
: pooled placebo, will provide at least 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference in the 
percent change from baseline to Week 16 in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score between the highest 
dose of MEDI3506 and pooled placebo in a responder subgroup, assuming a 35% point difference between 
placebo and MEDI3506 at the highest dose, based on a SD of 40% points, a two-sided 10% alpha level, and 
50% of subjects in the responder subgroup. Based on identical assumptions, the sample size provides > 99% power to detect a statistically significant dose response in percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI 
score in all-comers.
The calculations for dose response assume that percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI score will 
increase monotonically with the administration of higher MEDI3506 doses. The power was calculated using a 
multiple comparison procedure with modelling techniques (MCP-Mod) with 4 candidate models for the dose 
response (linear, maximum effect attributable to the drug [E
max], and 2 Hill-E maxmodels). Randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_635272] E (IgE) (< 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L) at screening.
To allow for the possibility that ≤5% of the subjects per treatment group may be ineligible for the ITT 
population, the total sample size will comprise  approximately 152 subjects (58 for MEDI3506 , 18 for 
MEDI3506 , 18 for MEDI3506 , and 58 for pooled placebo) randomized approximately to 
3:1:1:3 ratio overall to the treatment groups.CCI

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 8 of 132 Template 18.0Statistical Analyses:
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI score. To assess the 
dose response at Week 16, percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI score will be analyzed using the mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) including data from visits up to Week 16. The model will include treatment group, randomization stratum (total IgE level < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L), visit, and treatment 
group by [CONTACT_635273], with baseline EASI as a covariate and the baseline*visit interaction term. Visit will be a repeated factor within a subject and unstructured variance-covariance matrix 
will be used to describe the correlations between observations on a subject between visits. The coefficient of the 
treatment effects at Week 16 obtained from the MMRM will then be incorporated into an MCP-Mod, with 
4 candidate models (linear, E
maxand 2 Hill-E maxmodels) to determine the dose response profile. The estimand of 
primary interest is the difference in mean percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI score between 
MEDI3506 and placebo in the ITT population. Data that ar e collected after withdrawal from the study or the 
use of rescue therapy will be treated as missing and excluded from the analysis.Secondary Efficacy Analyses:
A key secondary efficacy endpoint is the percentag e of subjects achieving an IGA response of 0 (clear) or 
1 (almost clear) and at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at Week 16. IGA response at Week 16 will be 
analyzed for the ITT population using logistic regression including treatment group, randomization stratum 
(total serum IgE level < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L), and baseline IGA as categorical factors. The coefficient of 
the treatment effects at Week 16 obtained from the logistic regression will then be used in an MCP-Mod 
analysis with 4 candidate models for the dose response (linear, E max, and 2 Hill-E maxmodels). As part of the 
MCP-Mod model, the testing of the [ADDRESS_848631] is defined as achieving a 50% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI 50), a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI 75), or 90% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI 90) response if they have at least a 50%, 75%, or 90% reduction from baseline in EASI score, respectively. EASI 50, EASI 75, and EASI 90 response at Week 16 will be analyzed using a logistic regression model including treatment group and randomization stratum (total serum IgE level < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L) as categorical factors, and baseline 
EASI score as a covariate for each endpoint. In add ition, the percentage of sub jects ach ieving an EASI 75 
response at Week 16 will be analyzed for the ITT population using logistic regression followed by a dose 
response model similar to that described above for IGA response at Week 16.Change from baseline to Week 16 in % body surface area affected by [CONTACT_635274], 5-D itch, 
Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, Dermatology Life Quality Index; and percent change from baseline to 
Week 16 in SCORing Atopic Der matitis; will be summarized descriptively and analyzed for the ITT population 
using a MMRM, including data from visits up to Week 16. Details of the model for each endpoint are similar to those described above for the primary efficacy endpoint.
Daily peak pruritus N umerical Rating Scale (NRS) assessments will be summarized as weekly means. The 
weekly mean score will be set to missing if > 3 assessments are missed in that 7-day period. The percentage of subjects achieving a ≥3 point reduction from baseline to Week 16 in weekly mean of daily peak pruritus NRS 
will be analyzed using a logistic regression model including treatment group and randomization stratum (total serum IgE < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L), and baseline weekly mean of daily peak pruritus score as a covariate.
Furthermore, change from baseline to Week 16 in the weekly mean of daily peak pruritus NRS will be analyzed using a MMRM, using a model similar to those described above for the primary efficacy endpoint.
Daily peak skin pain NRS assessments will be summarized as weekly means. The weekly mean score will be 
set to missing if > [ADDRESS_848632] as described above for the primary 
efficacy endpoint.
Patient Global Impression of Severity will be summarized with descriptive statistics including number of 
subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum at each visit. In addition, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be summarized by [CONTACT_765].

Vital signs, ECG parameters and left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by [CONTACT_635276].
Analysis of Immunogenicity and PK:
The incidence rate of positive antibodies to MEDI3506 and anti-drug antibody (ADA) titer will be reported by 
[CONTACT_1570]. Depending on the incidence of ADA, further analysis of ADAs effects may include assessment of the relationships between ADA titer and:
• MEDI3506 exposure.
• Biomarker endpoints.
• Occurrence of AEs.
MEDI3506 serum concentrations will be tabulated and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Additional PK 
analyses may be conducted as appropriate. If the data allow, population PK analysis will be performed but will not be reported in the Clinical Study Report.
Primary and Final Analyses:
No formal interim analyses are planned for this study. The primary analysis will occur once all subjects have 
either completed the Visit 10 (Week 16) assessments or have withdrawn from the study and will include all 
available data. The final analysis will occur when all s ubjects have completed the follow-up period at Visit 12 
(Week 24) or have  withdrawn from the study.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 20 of 132 Template 18.01 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Disease Background
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease commonly referred to as 
eczema. In severe AD, there is widespread skin involvement. Affected skin may be red, itchy, swollen, cracked, weepi[INVESTIGATOR_635242], and/or scaling. Pruritus is frequently intractable and 
with breakdown of barrier function there is an increased risk of bacterial, viral, and/or fungal 
skin infections. There may also be scarring in the form of lichenification, excoriation, papulation, or induration, due to chronic disease, the effects of treatment, or infective complications.
Up to 25% of children (DaVeiga, 2012) and 5% of adults (Barbarot et al, 2018) are affected 
by [CONTACT_22802]. Of the adults, 20% to 37% have moderate disease with 10% to 34% reported with severe disease (Kim et al, 2016; Pawankar, 2013) . Patients with moderate-to-severe AD have 
a poor quality of life through a combination of symptoms, emotional stress from poor self-image, the burden of applying topi[INVESTIGATOR_635243], sleep disturbance, and 
reductions in work productivity ( Kiebert et al, 2002) . Treatment recommendations for AD 
include liberal use of emollients, dry skin care protocols, topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] (TCSs), and topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726] (TCIs).
For many patients with moderate-to-severe AD, TCS therapy has inadequate efficacy. In 
addition, long-term TCS use is associated with si de effects such as thinning and discoloration 
of the skin, increased risk of skin infection, contact [CONTACT_8748], decreased bone density, and 
slowing of growth in children ( Ring et al, 2012) . A high proportion of patients have a partial 
or no clinical response to TCI therapy. Moreover, long-term safety of TCIs has not been 
established, and continuous, long-term use should be avoided (Elidel, 2017; Protopic, 2012) . 
Off-label use of systemic immunomodulatory agents including cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil is reserved for patients with poor AD control despi[INVESTIGATOR_635244] ( Sidbury et al, 2014) . Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 
(Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12460]®), an anti-interleukin (IL) 4R α monoclonal antibody (mAb), is approved as an 
add-on therapy for adults and adolescents with  moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not 
adequately controlled with topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491] . However, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_635245]. Consequently, there is an unmet need for new therapeutic agents for AD that improve outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe disease.
1.2 MEDI3506 Background
MEDI3506 is briefly described below. Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for details.
MEDI3506 is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 mAb that binds to human IL-33. MEDI3506 
neutralizes the pro-inflammatory actions of IL- 33 by [CONTACT_635277]-33 to its 
[COMPANY_008] Protocol D9182C00001 Amendment 9
MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_848646] in murine models of AD ( Imai et al, 
2013; Peng et al, 2018) . Clinical data also support a role for anti-IL-33 therapy in AD. An 
uncontrolled (ie, no placebo group), Phase 2a clinical study of a single intravenous (IV) dose 
of etokimab (ANB020; anti-IL-33 neutralizing antibody) showed efficacy of etokimab in 
adults with moderate-to-severe AD, indicating the potential of anti-IL-33 therapy for treating AD ( Ogg, 2018) . As both MEDI3506 and etokimab have a similar mechanism of action, the 
Phase 2a etokimab clinical study data provide  support for investigating the therapeutic 
potential of MEDI3506 in AD. However, a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study of multiple doses of etokimab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD has, according to a preliminary report, not met its primary endpoint of statist ically si gnificant improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) compared 
with placebo at Week 16 (AnaptysBio, 2019) .

1.4 Summary of Clinical Experience
One Phase 1 clinical study of MEDI3506 (S tudy D9180C00001) has been completed to date.
Study D9180C00001 was a Phase 1, first time in human, randomized, blinded (investigator 
and subject blinded; sponsor unblinded), pla cebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity of single and repeated doses of MEDI3506. The 
study had 3 parts. Part I involved single ascending dose administration of MEDI3506 either 
SC or IV to healthy adult subjects with a hi story of mild atopy, Part II involved multiple 
ascending dose administration of MEDI3506 SC to adult subjects with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) I to II chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Part III involved single dose administration of MEDI3506 IV to healthy adult Japanese subjects.
In healthy subjects with a history of mild atopy in Part I of the study, a similar proportion of 
subjects experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE; ie, adverse events 
[AEs] occurring after the first dose of investigational product [MEDI3506 or placebo]) in the 
MEDI3506 and placebo groups. All reported TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 (mild or moderate) in severity. There were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation of investigational product, treatment- emergent serious a dverse events (TESAEs), or deaths.
In subjects with GOLD I to II COPD in Part II of the study, a similar proportion of subjects 
experienced at least 1 TEAE in the MEDI3506 and placebo groups. A maj ority of reported CCI

MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_848648], and 2 subjects experienced 2 TESAEs ([ADDRESS_848649]). There was [ADDRESS_848650] order elimination for single doses of 1 to 300 mg SC. There was no evidence of an antigen sink. For multiple every 2 weeks (Q2W) SC doses in subjects with GOLD I to II COPD, slight 
accumulation was observed, based on the trough concentration, following the first and third 
dose. The multiple and single dose half-lives were consistent.
Nine out of 88 subjects were anti-drug antibody (ADA)-positive at any time point. 
Treatment-emergent ADA were detected in 4 out of 66 subjects in the MEDI3506 groups. No subjects in the placebo groups (N = 22) had treatment-emergent ADA. TEAEs were similar in frequency and severity for ADA-positive and ADA-negative subjects. No impact of ADA on MEDI3506 PK was observed, except in [ADDRESS_848651] where the onset of treatment-emergent ADA coincided with a decrease in MEDI3506 serum concentration.
Please refer to the IB for further details.
1.5 Rationale for Conducting the Study
IL-33 is a cytokine constitutively expressed at endothelial and epi[INVESTIGATOR_635246]. On release, IL-33 induces Type 2 (T2) inflammation, stimulating production of IL-[ADDRESS_848652] found increased 
concentrations of IL-33 mRNA, and ST2 mRNA and protein, in the skin lesions of patients with AD and in the skin of mice induced to develop AD (Dickel et al, 2010; Savinko et al, 
2012) . In addition, IL-33 impacts skin barrier in tegrity by [CONTACT_635278], a structural protein that plays a key role in AD skin barrier function ( Salimi et al, 
2013; Seltmann et al, 2015) . Genetic studies also support a role for IL-[ADDRESS_848653] been linked to protection from allergic disorders (Smith et al, 2017) . Genetic 
polymorphisms within the ST2 gene region are associated with AD ( Shimizu et al, 2005) .

MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_848654] particular 
significant risk factors for COVID-19 should be  included during the pandemic, per Exclusion 
Criterion  10. Subjects older than 65 years are additionally excluded as they are at greater risk, 
per Inclusion Criterion  2.
Subjects who are suspected (or known) to have COVID-[ADDRESS_848655] to attend a study visit, th en the patient should be contact[CONTACT_635279], changes in concomitant medications, and other assessments that 
may be performed entirely verbally. Polymer ase chain reaction testing for severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the virus causing COVID- 19) is not 
mandated for this study, as a subject with a negative result may become infected at any time 
after the sample was taken. Testing for COVID- 19 may and should be performed, if required, 
by [CONTACT_5737] / national guidelines.
It is recognized that depending on the location and facilities of a clinical site, study visit 
attendance may place subjects at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, it is recognized that more general p opulation level measures to reduce infection r ates (eg, travel 
restrictions) may inhibit the ability of subjects  to attend study visits. Necessary healthcare 
responses to the pandemic at sites (eg, additional infection control measures) may also inhibit the ability of a clinical site to  effectively and properly conduct the study. Study visit 
attendance for dosing and for clinical assessments of treatment response are crit ical for the 
scientific value of the study.
Therefore, investigators should not enrol subjects unless they have reasonable confidence that 
throughout the duration of the study:
∀Subjects will be able to attend study visits, whilst avoiding contact [CONTACT_635280]-19 patients (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_635247]) and
∀The site will be able to effectively and sa fely conduct the study, considering relevant 
national and local factors.
The sponsor will conduct risk-based enrolment asse ssments on a country and site level, on a 
regular basis during the pandemic phase, and decisions will be documented.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 27 of 132 Template 18.0All site staff should wear personal protective equipment in accordance with local or national 
guidelines.
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) which, in the event of missing data, uses all data that are available. The sponsor will monitor the number of discontinuations, withdrawals, missed visits, and other missing data.
Given the limited additional risks to the study population re lated to COVID- 19, from study 
participation, beyond those they would experience in everyday life, the mitigations described 
above are considered sufficient to ensure a favorable benefit-risk balance.
[IP_ADDRESS] Vaccination Against COVID-19
There are no clinical data available to assess the interaction (if any) of MEDI3506 with any 
COVID-[ADDRESS_848656]’s best interest. Consequently, vaccination during the study is, in general, permitted and any delays in 
vaccination due to study participation should be minimized.
To help ensure the interpretability of safety d ata, receipt of COVID-19 vaccine (either first or 
subsequent dose) is prohibited within [ADDRESS_848657] (Section  4.7.3) . Receipt of, at least, the first dose of 
COVID-[ADDRESS_848658]. If the (approximate) date of a subsequent dose of 
COVID-[ADDRESS_848659] does (unexpectedly)

3.1.1 Overview
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double- blinded, placebo-cont rolled, pa rallel-group, 
proof-of-concept study to evaluate the efficacy, safety , PK, and immunogenicity of 
MEDI3506 in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe AD (Figure 1) . Approximately

≥150 kU/L) at screening. The study will be  conducted at approximately 40 to 50 study sites in 
Australia, Europe, and North America.
Subjects will be enrolled in this study for approximately 7 months (28 weeks), comprising a 
screening and TCS/TCI wash out period of up to 4 weeks, a 16-week treatment period, and an 
8-week follow-up period (Figure 1) :

subjects will be assessed for study eligibility (Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 ) at screening 
Visit [ADDRESS_848665] occur 7 or more 
days prior to randomization. Subjects who meet the eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) 
criteria will discontinue use of TCSs and TCIs  at Visit 2. Subjects will be required to 
apply moisturizers twice daily for at least 7 days before randomization at Visit 3 (Day 1) with a minimum of 85% compliance.
2 Treatment period: To be randomized at Visit 3 (Day 1), subjects must meet all the 
eligibility criteria (Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3) before receiving investigational product by 
[CONTACT_10530] . Subjects will be required to apply moisturizers twice daily throughout 
the treatment period, and will not be permitted to use TCSs and TCIs, except if medically 
necessary (Section 4.7.4) .  
and the primary endpoint assessment will occur at Visit 10 
(Week 16).
The first 72 subjects randomized will attend Visit 4a, whereas the remaining subjects will 
attend Visit 4b instead (Table 7) .
Following provision of informed consent, skin punch biopsies at Visit 3 (Day 1) and 
Visit 10 (Week 16) will be collected from a subset of subjects (ie, approximately 45 subjects in total). Subjects with comorbid chronic inflammatory conditions of the nasal mucosa and/or paranasal sinuses (eg, chronic rhinitis/rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, allergic 
rhinitis) will complete the Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT)-22 questionnaire. Similarly, 
subjects with comorbid asthma will complete the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-6 questionnaire.
3 Follow-up period: Safety, sustained efficacy, and the need for rescue therapy will be 
assessed in the follow-up period. Subjects will be required to apply moisturizers twice 
daily through to the end of the follow-up period at Visit 12 (Week 24), and will not be permitted to use TCSs and TCIs, except if medically necessary (Section 4.7.4) .

The nature and severity of disease in the study population are not exp ected to significantly 
impact the overall exposure nor clearance. The published PK data for a monoclonal antibody licensed for use in AD indicate that the disease status (ie, healthy subjects vs subjects with AD) had no significant impact on exposure or clearance (Kovalenko et al, 2016) . Hence, we 
anticipate that MEDI3506 exhibits similar PK prof iles for both h ealthy subjects and subjects 
with AD.

exploratory endpoints to investigate if these comorbidities might be improved by [CONTACT_514266]3506 (Silverberg and Simpson, 2013; Spergel, 2010) .
3.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is percent change from baseline in EASI score. The EASI is a valid and 
reliable quantitative tool for assessing AD severity over time ( Schmitt et al, 2013)
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]) .
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints will provide information to support the interpretation of the 
primary endpoint.
Clinical scientific experts advise that an EASI score ≥16 at randomization and an 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥3 reliably identify subjects with 
moderate-to-severe AD, so cut-off values for EASI and IGA were included as inclusion 
criteria (Section 4.1.2) .
Standard safety, PK, and immunogenicity endpoints will be evaluated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Endpoints
Blood samples will be collected from subjects for the assessment of biomarkers that are 
relevant to disease pathology and/or the mechanism of action of MEDI3506.
Skin punch biopsies and skin tape strips will allow biomarker analyses directly from the target 
tissue.
Skin swabs will be collected  from subjects to evaluate Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) 
colonization. Levels of S aureus have been correlated with disease severity (Simpson et al, 
2018) .
Many patients with AD have comorbid c hronic rhinosinusitis. SNOT-22, a measure of nasal 
symptoms, will be performed and evaluated in subjects with comorbid chronic rhinos inusitis.

4.1.[ADDRESS_848682] Enrollment and Randomization
Study participation begins (ie, a subject is “enrolled”) once written informed consent is obtained. Once informed consent is obtained, a subject identif ication (SID) number w ill be 
assigned by a central system (ie, an interactive voice/web response system [IXRS]) and the screening evaluations may begin to assess study  eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria. The 
SID number will be used to identify the subject during the screening process and throughout study participation. At Visit 3 (Day 1), once a subject has been fully assessed as meeting the 
eligibility criteria, the central IXRS system will be used to randomize the subject (Section 4.6.1) .
A log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all screening 
failures (ie, subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria and/or are not 
randomized), including the reason(s) for screening failure. Rescreening of subjects who fail to

key disease signs and focuses on the acute and chronic signs of  inflammation (ie, erythema, 
edema, papulation, excoriation, and lichenificatio n). The maximum score is 72, with higher 
values indicating more severe disease.
The EASI including percentage BSA affected by [CONTACT_635287] (Table 6, Table 7,  and Table 8) . The EASI will be completed by 
[CONTACT_635288], which will calculate the domain and total scores for the subject. Additional instru ctions for the investigator are described in 
Section 4.2. The percentage of subjects achieving a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema 
Area and Severity Index score (EASI 75), 50% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI 50), and 90% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and 
Severity Index score (EASI 90) will be calculated from the EASI scores. The percentage BSA 
affected by [CONTACT_635289] a component of EASI and will be analyzed separately from the composite 
EASI score.
[IP_ADDRESS] IGA
The IGA allows investigators to assess overall AD disease severity at 1 given time point and 
consists of a 5-point severity scale from cl ear to very severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost 
clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, and 4 = severe disease;  Appendix H) . The IGA 
uses clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation, oozing, and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity assessment.
The IGA will be assessed according to the schedule of study procedures (Table 6, Table 7,  and 
Table 8) , and will be completed by [CONTACT_635290]. Additional instructions for the investigator are described in Section 4.2.

intensity of AD lesions, in addition to subjective symptoms ( Kunz et al, 1997) . The maximum 
total score is 103, with higher values indicating more severe disease.
A suitable area of non-lesional skin will be designated at screening for SCORAD assessments 
of skin dryness at Visit 1. To allow for the assessment of skin dryness, moisturizers should not be applied to the designated area for ≥8 hours before visits when SCORAD will be assessed. 
This should be explained to subjects at Visit 1.
SCORAD will be assessed according to the schedule of study procedures (Table 7 and 
Table 8) . SCORAD will be completed on an electronic device supplied to the site, which will

Whole blood for RNA PAXgene will be collected according to the schedule of study 
procedures (Table 7 and Table 8) . RNA PAXgene will be used for the collection, transport, 
and storage of whole blood, and the stabilization of intracellular RNA. RNA transcript profiling analyses (Section [IP_ADDRESS])  will be performed on RNA PAXgene samples.
[IP_ADDRESS] Skin Punch Biopsies
Following provision of informed consent, skin punch biopsy samples will be collected from a 
subset of subjects according to the schedule of study procedures (Table 7) .
Local anesthesia may be used in accordance w ith local practices. Skin punch biopsy samples 
will be collected from areas of lesional and non -lesional skin that are close in distance 
(≤5 cm) to each other. If possible, a 3 mm skin punch should be used. For the evaluation of 
the proinflammatory gene signature [CONTACT_77433], RNA transcript profiling (Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
analyses will be performed on skin punch biopsy samples. For the evaluation of gross inflammation, hematoxylin and eosin staini ng analyses will be performed on skin punch 
biopsy samples. 
At Visit 10, lesional and non-lesional skin biops y samples should be taken from areas close in 
distance to where the lesional and non-lesional samples, respectively, were taken at Visit 3.
[IP_ADDRESS] RNA Transcript Profiling of RNA PAXgene and Skin Punch Biopsy Samples
Intracellular RNA will be isolated and purified from whole blood RNA PAXgene 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS])  and skin punch biopsy (Section [IP_ADDRESS])  samples. Proinflammatory gene 
signatures will be quantified from the RNA. The expression levels of genes associated with 
disease activity, specific cell types, and signaling, including the IL-33/ST2 pathway will be quantified. The analyses will retrospectively ev aluate transcript biomarkers predictive of 
subject response at baseline, prior to investigational product administration, as well as potentially identify additional biomarkers. In add ition, these biomarker measurements will aid 
in the determination of which biological path ways are affected by [CONTACT_514266]3506.
[IP_ADDRESS] S aureus Colonization
S. aureus has the potential to exacerbate AD skin disease through colonization, 
super-infection of the skin, and production of inflammation-inducing toxins. Skin swabs will be collected from subjects to assess S. aureus colonization and infection according to the 
schedule of study procedures (Table 7 and Table 8) . Swabs will be rotated across non-lesional 
and lesional skin that are close in distance ( ≤5 cm) to each other. S. aureus colonization and 
infection will be characterized to determine whether differential benefit is observed among subjects in relation to S. aureus abundance, and if S. aureus colonization and infection are 
impacted by [CONTACT_46054]3506 treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 72 of 132 Template [IP_ADDRESS] Methods for Unblinding
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding in the Event of a Medical Emergency
In the event of a medical emergency, the investigator may unblind an individual subject’s 
investigational product allocation. Instructions for unblinding an individual subject’s 
investigational product allocation are contained in the IXRS manual. In general, unblinding 
should only occur if management of the medical emergency would be different based on the subject having received MEDI3506. In the majority of cases, the management of a medical emergency would be the same whether or not investigational product was received by [CONTACT_423]. If this were the case, the investigational product allocation should not be unblinded. In the event there is unblinding, the investigator should promptly document and explain to [COMPANY_008] the reason for any premature unblinding.
[COMPANY_008] retains the right to unblind the treatment allocation for serious adverse events 
(SAEs) that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an investigational 
product and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding for DSMB Purposes
If unblinding is required by [CONTACT_4318] (Section 3.1.3) , details of the methods for unblinding 
(sponsor will remain blinded) will be provided in a separate DSMB charter.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding for Primary Analysis Purposes
The primary analysis (Section 4.8.7)  will be performed after all subjects have completed 
Visit 10 (Week 16) or have withdrawn from the study. The sponsor staff will be unblinded 
following database lock for the primary analysis. Investigators and site staff will not be made 
aware of unblinded treatment assignments for individual subjects who are in the follow-up period until these subjects have completed the study.
4.7 Restrictions During the Study and Concomitant Treatment(s)
The investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from the time of screening until the final study visit. Any concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF.
4.7.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide ade quate supportive care except for prohibited medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]

4.7.4 Prohibited Concomitant Medications as Rescue Therapy
As this is a study of the effects of MEDI 3506 in patients with AD not using TCS or TCI, 
inappropriate use of TCS, TCI or other prohibited concomitant medications as rescue therapy could undermine the validity/integrity of the tri al. For example, use of rescue medication by a 
patient, before sufficient time has passed since first dose, to allow the opportunity for the investigational product to demonstrate beneficial effects on AD severity, may lead to those beneficial effects being undetected. Therefore, the following restrictions on the use of rescue 
therapy must be observed to ensure appropriate use.
If medically necessary for intolerable AD symptoms that occur throughout the study, rescue 
therapy with otherwise prohibited concomitant medications or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Section 4.7.3)  may 
be prescribed to subjects . In all other circumstances, rescue therapy should be restricted to 
subjects at or after Visit 7 (Day 29), who have:
∀A worsening of EASI by ≥50% from baseline, or
∀A clinically significant, dis proportionate w orsening of pruritus sustained for at least 
[ADDRESS_848728] despi[INVESTIGATOR_635264] 
(Section 4.7.1)  and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_635265].
Rescue therapy should only be prescribed after assessment of the subject in the clinic, either at 
a scheduled or unscheduled visit. A justification for each subject who commences rescue therapy must be documented by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator in the clinical notes.
Rescue therapy should initially be restricted to topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491] (ie, TCSs or TCIs, or any 
other topi[INVESTIGATOR_900]-inflammatory treatment [eg, crisaborole]). TCSs should be prescribed at the lowest potency appropriate for the situati on. TCIs should be reserved for problem areas only

(SAP).
4.8.2 Sample Size
A sample size of 144 subjects in an overall 3:1:1:3 ratio of MEDI3506 :MEDI3506 
:MEDI3506 :pooled placebo, will provide at least 90% power to detect a 
statist ically si gnificant difference in the percent change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_848733] dose of MEDI3506 and pooled placebo in a responder subgroup, assuming a 35% point difference between placebo and MEDI3506 at the highest dose, based on a SD of 40% points, a two-sided 10% alpha level, and 50% of subjects in the responder subgroup. Based on identical assumptions, the sample size provides > 99% power to detect a statist ically si gnificant dose response in percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI 
score in all-comers.
The calculations for dose response assume that percent change from baseline to Week 16 in 
EASI score will increase monotonically with the administration of higher MEDI3506 doses. 
The power was calculated using a multiple comparison procedure with modelling techniques (MCP-Mod) (Bretz et al, 2005) with 4 candidate models for the dose response (linear, 
maximum effect attributable to the drug [E
max], and 2 Hill-E maxmodels). Randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_635297] (< 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L) at screening.
To allow for the possibility that ≤5% of the subjects per treatment group may be ineligible for 
the ITT population, the total sample size will comprise approximately 152 subjects (58 for 
MEDI3506 , 18 for MEDI3506 , 18 for MEDI3506 , and 58 for pooled 
placebo) randomized approximately to 3:1:1:3 ratio overall to the treatment groups.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 77 of 132 Template 18.0To assess dose response at Week 16, percent change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI score 
will be analyzed using an MMRM including data from visits up to Week 16. The model will include treatment group, randomization stratum (total serum IgE < 150 kU/L or ≥ 150 kU/L), 
visit, and treatment group by [CONTACT_635273], with baseline EASI score as a covariate and the baseline*visit interaction term. Visit will be a repeated factor within a 
subject and an unstructured variance-covariance matrix will be used to describe the 
correlations between observa tions on a subject between visits. If the unstructured 
variance-covariance matrix will not fit, then suitable alternatives will be considered, with details provided in the SAP. The coefficient of the treatment effects at Week 16 obtained from the MMRM will then be incorporated into an MCP-Mod (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_577033], 2014) , with 
4 candidate models (linear, E
max, and 2 Hill-E maxmodels) to determine the dose response 
profile. As part of the MCP-Mod model, the testing of the [ADDRESS_848734] is the difference in mean percent change from baseline to 
Week 16 in EASI score between MEDI3506 and placebo in the ITT population. Data that are collected after withdrawal from the study, or the use of rescue therapy will be treated as missing and excluded from the analysis. From the final model obtained from the MCP-Mod 
dose response analysis, the adjusted difference in mean percent change from baseline in EASI score between the placebo group and each MEDI3506 group at Week 16 will be estimated 
along with the 90% confidence inte rval (CI) and two-sided p-value. In addition, an estimate of
the adjusted difference in mean percent change from baseline in EASI at each visit for each treatment group will be summarized together with a two-sided 90% CI, and p-value.

A supplementary analysis using the ITT population will be done using all available data from 
subjects irrespective of whether or not they completed treatment, including data collected after 
subjects received rescue therapy. A MMRM followed by a MCP-Mod dose response model 
will be used for the analysis as described above for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) .
A second supplementary analysis will be performed using the ITT population. Data from 
assessments performed after prohibited medications (eg, rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) are received will be excluded and a last observation carried forward approach will be applied for the missing data. An ANCOVA followed by a MCP-Mod dose response model including treatment group and randomization stratum (total serum IgE level < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L) as categorical factors 
and baseline EASI score as covariate, with 4 candidate models for the dose response (linear,

[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Analyses
IGA Response at Week 16
A key secondary efficacy endpoint is the per centage of subjects achieving an IGA response of 
0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at Week 16.
IGA response at Week 16 will be analyzed for the ITT population using logistic regression
including treatment group, randomization stratum (total serum IgE level < 150 kU/L or ≥150 kU/L), and baseline IGA as categorical factors. The coefficient of the treatment effects 
at Week 16 obtained from the logistic regression will then be used in an MCP-Mod analysiswith 4 candidate models for the dose response (linear, E
max, and 2 Hill-E maxmodels). As part 
of the MCP-Mod model, the testing of the [ADDRESS_848736] is the difference in IGA response rate at Week 16 
between MEDI3506 and placebo in the ITT population. Subjects who withdraw from the study or require rescue therapy will be considered as non-responders. From the final model obtained from the MCP-Mod dose response analysis, the difference in IGA response rate between the placebo and each MEDI3506 group will be estimated along with the 90% CI. For each MEDI3506 group versus placebo, the results will be presented as the difference in 
response rates, the 90% CI for the difference in response rates, and two-sided p-value.
Additional Analyses of the IGA Response at Week [ADDRESS_848737] or withdraw

The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a

run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to

will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
5.4.12 Hy’s Law
Cases where a subject shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with TBL ≥2 × ULN may need to be
reported as SAEs. Please refer to  Appendix E for further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry and evaluation of HL.
5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by [CONTACT_635307] a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify bot h the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country-specific regul atory requirements relating to safety reporting 
to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and investigators.
For all studies except those utilizing medical devices investigator safety reports must be 
prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the IB or and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system, an automated email aler t is sent to inform the designated sponsor 
representative(s).
If the EDC system is not available, then the i nvestigator or other study site personnel reports 
an SAE to the appropriate sponsor representative by [CONTACT_756]. The sponsor representative will advise the investigator/study site personnel how to proceed.

∀An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
∀An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] investigational product occurs during the course of the 
study, then the investigator or other site personnel should inform appropriate sponsor 
representatives immediately, but no later than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.
The designated sponsor representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is provided to the sponsor’s Patient Safety data entry site.
For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply; see Section 5.5. 
For other overdoses (ie, those not associated with an AE or SAE), reporting must occur within [ADDRESS_848752].
[IP_ADDRESS] Maternal Exposure
If a subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study, investigational product should be 
discontinued immediately.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_429001] a contraceptive medication. Congenital anomalies/birth defects and spontan eous miscarriages should be reported and 
handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital anomaly) should be followed  up and documented even if the 
subject was discontinued from the study.

Medication error includes situations where an error:
∀Occurred.
∀Was identified and intercepted before the subject received the investigational product.
∀Did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error.
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
∀Drug name [CONTACT_2976] (ie, instead of receiving the investigational product, the subject 
received a medication that has a similar-sounding name).
∀Dispensing error, eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to

Section of the Protocol Affected Reason for Amendment
Synopsis, Table 7 (Schedule of Treatment Period 
Study Procedures) and Section 3.1.1 (Overview)An additional PK sampling timepoint has been added 
for the 73rd and subsequent randomized subjects. 
This is to better characterize the pharmacokinetics 
(absorption phase) of MEDI3506 with the current 
formulation. The additional timepoint requires an 
additional visit to site early after the first dose, this 
(in addition to the clinical experience gained by [CONTACT_87335]) leaves the telephone call with the subject on Day 2 unnecessary and so it has been removed for applicable subjects.

Women are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they meet either of the criteria, 
as follows:
∀Surgically sterilized (including bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or 
hysterectomy), or
∀Post-menopausal.
For women aged < [ADDRESS_848774]-menopausal is defined as having both:
∀A history of ≥12 months amenorrhea, without an alternative cause, following cessation of 
exogenous sex-hormonal treatment and,
∀A follicle-stimulating hormone level in the post-menopausal range.
For women aged ≥[ADDRESS_848775]-menopausal is defined as having a history of ≥12 months 
amenorrhea, without an alternative cause, following cessation of exogenous sex-hormonal treatment.
A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate 
(ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. The acceptable methods of 
contraception are described in  Table A1.
Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of 
contraception.

! Injectable
! Transdermal (patch)
Progestogen-only hormonal contraception
! Desogestrel
aThis is also considered a hormonal method.
bWith appropriate post-vasectomy medical testing of surgical success (ie, absence of sperm in ejaculate).
cSexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of the study and if it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 115 of 132 Template 18.0Appendix B Additional Safety Guidance
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from an adverse event 
(AE) as it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the subject’s death. ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hep atitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169939] a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not  considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study.
Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability or incapacity bu t may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_848776] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.
Examples of such events are:
∀Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous (IV) 
hydrocortisone treatment.
∀Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine.
∀Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm.
∀Blood dyscrasias (eg, neut ropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion) or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

Assessment of Severity
Assessment of severity is one of the responsibilities of the investigator in the evaluation of 
AEs and SAEs. The determination of severity should be made by [CONTACT_469063] 1 to 5 as defined below.

Grade [ADDRESS_848778]. The followi ng factors should be considered when deciding if there is a 
“reasonable possibility” that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].
∀Time Course. Exposure to suspect investigational product. Has the subject actually 
received the suspect investigational product? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect investigational product?
∀Consistency with known investigational product profile. Was the AE consistent with the 
previous knowledge of the suspect investigational product (pharmacology and toxicology) or products of the same pharmacological class? OR could the AE be anticipated from its 
pharmacologi cal properties?
∀De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_469027]?

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 117 of 132 Template 18.0∀No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_230614], other drugs, or other host or environmental factors.
∀Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected investigational product was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally recommend or 
support a re -challenge.
∀Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship?
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
∀Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the investigational product?
∀Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of “related” is made if following a rev iew of the relevant data, there is evidence for 
a “reasonable possibility” of a causal relations hip for the individual case. The expression 
“reasonable possibility” of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is  performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as “not related.”
Causal relationship in cases where the diseas e under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.
Relationship to Protocol Procedures
The investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relationship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes nontreatment-emergent SAEs (ie, SAEs that occur prior to the administration of investigational product) as well as treatment-emergent SAEs. A protocol-related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required 
during the study (eg, blood collection, washout of an existing medication). The following 
guidelines should be used by [CONTACT_95108]:
Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure/intervention that was described 
in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the subject’s medical record.
Not protocol related: The event is related to  an etiology other than the procedure/ 
intervention that was described in the protocol (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record).

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NAID) and Food Allergy and 
Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. They recognize 3 categories of anaphylaxis, with criteria 
designated to capture from 80% of cases (category 1) to > 95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for 
all 3 categories). 
1 Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)
AND AT LEAST 1 OF THE FOLLOWING:
(a) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 121 of 132 Template 18.0Appendix E Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver Biochemistry 
and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
E1 Introduction
This appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately 
report potential Hy’s Law (PHL) cases and Hy’s Law (HL) cases. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. Specific guidance 
on managing liver abnormalities can be found in Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_848784] meets PHL 
criteria at any point during the study.
All sources of laboratory data are appropriate for the determination of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study vi sits and other visits including central and all 
local laboratory evaluations even if collected outsi de of the study visits; for example, PHL 
criteria could be met by [CONTACT_635314] (ALT) from a central laboratory and/or elevated total bilirubin (TBL) from a local laboratory.
The investigator will also review AE data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations 
in liver biochemistry) for possible PHL events.
The investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alternative exp lanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry 
other than drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_7198]. 
The investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.
E2 Definitions
E 2.1 Potential Hy’s Law
Aspartate transaminase (AST) or ALT ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) together with TBL 
≥2 × ULN at any point during the study following the start of investigational product
irrespective of an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP).
E 2.2 Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than 
the investigational product, can be found to explain the combination of increases; eg, elevated 
ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, or another drug.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_848785] precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
E3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to identify cases of PHL, it is impor tant to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any subject who meets any of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination:
∀ALT ≥ 3 × ULN.
∀AST ≥ 3 × ULN.
∀TBL ≥ 2 × ULN.
When a subject meets any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the 
central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the investigator (also sent to sponsor study 
representative).
The investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the 
identification criteria are met, where th is is the case the investigator will:
∀Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by [CONTACT_591354].
∀Complete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory case report form (CRF) module(s) with 
the original local laboratory test result.
When the identification criteria are met from cen tral or local laboratory results the investigator 
will wit hout delay:
∀Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria (see Section  E2 )  by [CONTACT_593298] (including both central and local laboratory 
results).
E4 Follow-up
E 4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Not Met
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the investigator will:
∀Inform the study representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria.
∀Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory re sults according to the guidance provided in 
the study protocol.

MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 123 of 132 Template 18.0E 4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met
If the subject does meet PHL criteria the investigator will:
∀Notify the sponsor study representative who will then inform the study team.
∀Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the investigator will report the case as an SAE of 
PHL; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causality assessment ‘yes/related’ 
according to clinical study protocol process for SAE reporting.
The medical monitor contacts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree on an 
approach for the study subjects’ follow-up (inc luding any further laboratory testing) and the 
continuous review of data. Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_280886]:
∀Monitor the subject until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. Complete follow-up SAE Form as required.
∀Investigate the etiology of the event and perfo rm diagnostic investigations as discussed 
with the medical monitor. This includes deciding which the tests available in the HL lab 
kit should be used.
∀Complete the relevant CRF Modules  as information becomes available.
E5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this section should be fo llowed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormality was initially  detected, th e medical 
monitor will contact [CONTACT_635315], to ensure timely analysi s and reporting to health authorities per local 
requirements from the date PHL criteria were met. The medical monitor and global safety physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate.
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the investigator will follow the 
instructions below.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for an SAE:
∀If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF.

MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 124 of 132 Template 18.0∀If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, update the previously submitted PHL SAE 
and AE CRFs accordingly with the new information (reassessing event term; causality 
and seriousness criteria) following the sponsor’s standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the investigational product:
∀Send the updated SAE (report term “Hy’s Law”) according to the sponsor’s standard 
processes.
#The “Medically Important” serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply.
#As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
“related” should be assigned.
If, there is an unavoidable delay of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the information 
necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:
∀Provide any further update to the previously submitted SAE of PHL (report term now 
“Hy’s Law case”), ensuring causality assessment is related to the investigational product 
and seriousness criteria are medically important,  according to the clinical study protocol 
process for SAE reporting.
∀Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following clinical study protocol process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of 
the review and amend the reported term if an alternative explanation for the liver 
biochemistry elevations is determined.
E6 Actions Required for Repeat Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33099]’s Law
This section is applicable when a subject meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has 
already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.
The requirement to conduct follow-up, review, and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.
The investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the following question:
∀Was the alternative cause for the previous o ccurrence of PHL criteria being met found to 
be the disease under study eg, chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe infection, 
or liver disease.

MEDI3506 15Jun2022; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 125 of 132 Template 18.0If No: follow the process described in Section  E 4.2,  for reporting PHL as an SAE.
If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant change in the subject’s condition compared 
with when PHL criteria were previously met:
∀If there is no significant change no action is required.
∀If there is a significant change follow the process described in Section  E 4.2,  for reporting 
PHL as an SAE.
A “significant” change in the subject’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator; this may be in consultation with the medical  monitor if there is any uncertainty.
E7 Laboratory Tests
The list below represents the standard, comprehensive list of follow-up tests which are 
recommended but not mandatory when using a central laboratory. For studies using a local laboratory, the list may be modified based on clinical judgment. If required, for additional assistance on which tests could be used to evaluate other potential causes of liver dysfunction, consult with the Hepatic Safety Knowledge Group. Any test results need to be recorded.

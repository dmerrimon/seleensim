statistical analysis plan. 
Sample Size and Power This study aims to evaluate the patient experience with new data 
collection methods and the association between new methods and 
the EHR-defined variables regarding disease severity and healthcare 
resource utilization, therefore no comparisons or hypothesis testing 
will be performed. In order to collect adequate information about 
the feasibility of these new data collection methods, approximately 
200  patients from the integrated 
delivery network (ION) will participate in the study (100 in each 
group COPO and asthma). If we assume a dropout rate of at most 
25%, we will have complete data on at least 150 patients, which will 
be sufficient to address feasibility of the new collection methods in 
two different cohorts. In addition, since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_217729], a formal power calculation is not required. 
Limitations Participants included in this study will be selected from among 
those within the  ION, therefore may not be 
representative of a sample of all COPO and asthma patients from 
the US. There will likely be a selection bias based on which 
patients are willing to participate in a study with multiple devices 
and due to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. Medication use 
and activity will be monitored using sensors so there is a risk that 
the patient's behavior may be altered.

1 INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND 
Flectronic health records (EHR) are becoming more common in clinical practice in the United 
States. This study aims to assess the feasibility of collecting increasing amounts of clinical study 
data from patients (e.g. sensor and web/app based methods) and their EHR to facilitate more 
efficient and meaningful research with acceptable quality. 
2 OBJECTIVES 
2.1 General Objective 
To recruit small cohorts (n=lO0 each) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 
asthma patients from their usual healthcare environment to gain experience with novel, digital 
data collection methods combined with EHR extraction to explore feasibility of larger real-world 
studies. Overall, we hope to assess how the use of EHR may be beneficial in recruiting 
populations for future clinical trials. 
2.2 Specific Objectives 
• To evaluate how representative the consented, study population is when compared to 
the eligible population. 
• To develop a monitoring dashboard for integration of data from various devices 
• To evaluate patient experience, data quality and consistency with novel, patient-data 
collection methods: 
o Mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] 
o Sensor for monitoring rescue medication use 
o Sensor for monitoring maintenance medication use 
o Physical activity monitor 
o Electronic patient reported outcomes (ePROs) -monthly CAT (COPD cohort), 
ACT (asthma cohort) 
• monthly PROactive -using the C-PPAC 
• For COPD only: EXACT PRO daily symptoms [ERS-COPD] 
• To assess the relationships between EHR-based healthcare utilization (ambulatory care 
visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217730]) and lab measures 
(specified below) with patient data remotely collected via methods outlined in previous 
bullet, for example. 
o EHR spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] 
o Blood WBC, eosinophils, neutrophils (number and%) 
o Other blood biomarker samples if available (e.g. fibrinogen, CRP, periostin, 
sRAGE etc) 
2.3 Information regarding devices 
All the data collected from the devices in this study listed above (i.e. mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_217731]) are for research use only. This means that the data cannot be used for clinical 
patient management or as a primary clinical outcome measure.

3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
3.1 Study Design 
This is a prospective study that will include two cohorts of patients (COPD and asthma) 
identified via EHR database analyses, study provider referral (COPD and asthma diagnoses with 
and without specialist confirmation), or recruited from sites of usual care. Participants will 
attend two visits with study team members at O and approximately [ADDRESS_261226] data will 
be captured either remotely via sensors and devices provided by [CONTACT_217738] a 
data pull of EHR data. At the baseline visit, study team members will obtain written informed 
consent, distribute study devices, and provide instruction for proper use of study devices and 
platforms. Approximately six months later, at the second visit, the patient will return study 
devices. Patients will then be called to complete an exit interview to provide relevant feedback 
on the study.

3.2.2 Sampling 
 located in  has a service area that is 
largely rural, mostly Caucasian, remarkably stable population (i.e., a very low out~migration 
rate), and a higher percentage ·of elderly patients (aged 65+) than the national average. 
 catchment area is one of the oldest and sickest in the nation in terms of multiple co-
morbidities. 
Patients will be selected based on the criteria previously described. 
[ADDRESS_261233] a Phenomic 
Analytics Clinical Data Core (PACDC) data broker identify potential participants through a data 
pull of EHR data or by [CONTACT_217739]. The second method is for study providers to refer eligible patients to the study 
team. The third method will have a study team member review the pulmonary clinics schedules 
and identify eligible patients. Potential subjects will be invited to participate. 
3.3.2 Baseline Visit 
A baseline clinic visit will be scheduled with interested patients and a study team member. At 
the visit, the potential participants will be informed of all pertinent details, risks, and benefits of 
the study via the study consent form. A study team member will answer any patient questions 
and patients will be given adequate time to consider participation. Written informed consent 
will be obtained using the study consent form. After consent, the participant will receive study 
devices and training on proper use ofthe devices. Patient vitals including height and weight will 
be collected by [CONTACT_464]. Participants will complete a baseline questionnaire. Data will be 
collected remotely from the devices and platforms for six months. 
3.3.3 Six Month Visit 
After six months(+/- 2 weeks), a second visit will be scheduled with the participant and a study 
team member. At the second visit, the participant will return the study devices and will 
complete an exit interview to obtain relevant feedback from the patient's perspective on the 
study. Exit interviews will be performed by  [CONTACT_6404]. 
3.[ADDRESS_261234] Participation 
Subjects will participate in the study for approximately 6 months. 
3.4.2 Approximate Duration of Study 
200 patients will be enrolled over an eight-month period, including 100 in the asthma cohort 
and 100 in the COPD cohort. Each patient will be followed for approximately six months after 
consent and enrollment into the study. 
3.5 Data Source / Data Collection 
Integrated EHR records (primary and specialty care) are the key source for retrospective 
analysis and for identifying patients. Digital data collection from patient reports, devices, 
sensors, and EHR records over six months are the key sources for the prospective analysis. The 
full data integration will happen in two stages and a summary of variables to be extracted in 
each stage is included in Section 6.4. The study database will be housed on a third-party 
vendor's secure network. In the initial data integration stage and at the baseline visit, the study

[COMPANY_003]
team member will manually enter patient information (including name, MRN, date of birth, 
gender, ethnicity, date of consent, height, and weight) into the study portal built into the study 
tablet. The information entered into the study portal will calibrate the predictive formulas in 
the study devices and flow to the study database on the third-party vendor's secure network. 
Patients will then take the study devices home and use them as instructed. Data from the study 
devices, including the mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_201992], the sensors for rescue and maintenance 
medications, activity monitors, and the ePRO platform will flow directly to the database on 
Vendor A's network. During stage one of the data integration, no EPIC data will be sentto the 
study database on the third-party vendor's secure network. 
During stage two of the data integration, EHR data will be extracted and combined with device 
data in the database housed on Vendor A's network. Vendor A will de-identify the study 
dat.ibase and send the data set to Vendor 8.  staff will administer a study Exit 
Interview at the follow-up visit asking participants to provide feedback on the study, the study 
devices, and ePRO platform. 
 data is part of the mini-sentinel monitoring system which means their 
data set meets standard criteria for data integrity and quality. 
3.6 Endpoints 
We will be measuring the following: 
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] 
• Activity (Steps and daily activity) 
• Patient experience of physical activity 
• COPD symptoms Exacerbations {COPD cohort only) 
• Rescue and maintenance medication use 
• Primary care and secondary care visits specific to each cohort and in general, 
• Number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], new prescriptions, number of albuterol inhalers specific to 
each cohort 
• CAT (COPD cohort) and ACT (asthma cohort) 
• Exit Interviews 
3.7 Sample Size/ Power Calculation 
This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of measuring patient experience with new data 
collection methods and the association between new methods and the EHR-defined variables 
regarding disease severity and healthcare resource utilization, therefore no comparisons or 
hypothesis testing will be performed. In order to collect adequate information about the 
feasibility of these new data collection methods, approximately 200  
 patients will participate in the study (100 in each group COPD and asthma). If we assume 
a dropout rate of at most 25%, we will have complete data on at least [ADDRESS_261235] 
deviations, medians and interquartile range (IQR), and for categorical variables, normally 
distributed and non-normally distributed continuous variables, respectively. Spearman 
correlations will also be assessed between endpoints. The following will be analyzed over the 
study period: 
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (mobile and clinic) 
o Change from baseline irr FEV1 
• Activity 
o Median/mean steps per day 
o Median/mean daily activity level based on vector magnitude units (VMUs) 
• PROactive total score and subdomains Symptoms 
• E-RS:COPD symptoms Exacerbations (COPD cohort only) 
o EXACT-defined events 
• HCRU 
o Median/mean number of primary care visits for COPD/asthma conditions 
o Median/mean number of secondary care visits (inpatient, urgent care and ED 
visits) for COPD/asthma conditions -
o Median/mean number of all primary care visits 
o Median/mean number of all secondary (inpatient, urgent care and ED visits) care 
visits 
o Summary of new prescriptions for any COPD/asthma treatments 
o Number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217733]/asthma 
o Number of albuterol inhalers (adjusted to equivalence of 200 actuations) 
prescribed 
• ePRO 
o Mean change from baseline in CAT (COPD cohort) 
o Mean change from baseline in ACT (asthma cohort) 
All analyses will be described in more detai l in the full statistical analysis plan. 
S LIMITATIONS 
Participants included in this study will be selected from among those within the  
 {ION), therefore may not be representative of a sample of all COPD and asthma 
patients from the US. There will likely be a selection bias based on which patients are willlng to 
participate in a study with multiple devices. Medication use and activity will be monitored 
using sensors so there is a risk that the patient's behavior may be altered. 
[ADDRESS_261236], MANAGEMENT & ETHICS 
6.1 Ethics Committee/I RB Approval 
The study will be submitted for Institutional Review Board (IRB) review. 
6.2 Informed Consent 
All participants will provide signed and dated informed consent prior to initiation of any study 
activities via the study consent form. 
6.3 Data Protection 
All data collected in this study will be strictly confidential in accordance with all appropriate 
legislation. Data from study devices and ePROs will be encrypted and automatically transmitted 
to Vendor A. The portal that the study staff will enter patient information into during stage one 
of the data integration, including dates, participant names, MRNs, date of birth, gender, and 
ethnicity will be reviewed and approved by  [CONTACT_217740], 
including PHI such as names, dates, and MRNS, will be encrypted and sent to Vendor A via a 
 approved, secure portal. Vendor A's Insight Platform maintains a HITRUST 
certification to protect patient data . Vendor A will integrate the data from study devices, 
ePROs, and  on their secure network. Vendor A will de-identify the integrated 
study data set and transfer the de-identified data set to Vendor B. 
Study staff will be instructed to maintain complete confidentiality of all collected data. Patient 
files will be kept on secure servers. The final study report will not contain any patient 
identifying information. Participants will be assigned a unique participant number in the final 
data set to ensure confidentiality and anonymity. Interview transcripts will be identified by [CONTACT_217741]. 
6.4 Personally Identifiable Information (PII) 
The final data set will be de-identified and will not contain PHI. However, Vendor A will have 
access to participant names, dates, date of birth, and MRNs to integrate data from multiple data 
sources including study device data, ePRO, EHR data, and Exit Interview transcripts. Vendor A will 
remove PHI elements from the dataset. PHI accessed for recruitment will only be seen by 
 [CONTACT_3655]. The final data set, housed by [CONTACT_217742] B, will be de-identified. 
The data in the table below, including relevant dates, will be collected. The table also outlines

6.5 Adverse Event (AE), Pregnancy Exposure, and Incident Reporting 
While this study does not involve the direct solicitation of adverse experience information, it is 
possible that participants could spontaneously describe potential adverse events that occurred 
during the course of their normal clinical care. 
As part of the site orientation process, study team members will be trained in the recognition of 
potentially-reportable adverse events.

If an AE (serious or non-serious) or product complaint is reported spontaneously by a subject 
during the course of the study and the subject associates the AE with any specifically named [COMPANY_004] 
product, the following AE reporting process will be completed: 
• The site staff will complete the AE reporting form (including the patient study ID 
number, their age and sex, the patient's description of the adverse event, and the 
product the patient named). 
The site staff will transmit the report to the [COMPANY_004] study team within 24 hours of being made aware 
of the AE. 
Patients will be asked about adverse events related to the use of the devices provided during the 
study (mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007], device sensor, activity monitor and tablet) at regular intervals via the 
study provided tablet. These data will not be monitored in real time and patients will be educated 
on the need to contact [CONTACT_217743].

resource utilization, therefore no comparisons or hypothesis testing 
will be performed. In order to collect adequate information about 
the feasibility of these new data collection methods, approximately 
200  patients from the integrated 
delivery network (IDN) will participate in the study (100 in each 
group COPD and asthma) . If we assume a dropout rate of at most 
25%, we will have complete data on at least 150 patients, which will 
be sufficient to address feasibility of the new collection methods in 
two different cohorts. In addition, since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_217737], a formal power calculation is not required. 
Participants included in this study will be selected from among 
those within the  IDN, therefore may not be 
representative of a sample of all COPD and asthma patients from 
the US. There will likely be a selection bias based on which 
patients are willing to participate in a study with multiple devices 
and due to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. Medication use 
and activity will be monitored using sensors so there is a risk that 
the patient's behavior may be altered.

1 INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND 
Electronic health records {EHR) are becoming more common in clinical practice in the United 
States. This study aims to assess the feasibility of collecting increasing amounts of clinical study 
data from patients (e.g. sensor and web/app based methods) and their EHR to facilitate more 
efficient and meaningful research with acceptable quality. 
2 OBJECTIVES 
2.1 General Objective 
To recruit small cohorts (n=100 each) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease {COPD) and 
asthma patients from their usual healthcare environment to gain experience with novel, digital 
data collection methods combined with EHR extraction to explore feasibility of larger real world 
studies. Overall, we hope to assess how the use of EHR may be beneficial in recruiting populations for 
future clinical trials. 
2.2 Specific Objectives 
• To evaluate how representative the consented, study population is when compared to the 
eligible population . 
• To develop a monitoring dashboard for integration of data from various devices

methods: 
o Mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] 
o Sensor for monitoring rescue medication use 
o Sensor for monitoring maintenance medication use 
o Physical activity monitor 
o Electronic patient reported outcomes {ePROs) -monthly CAT {COPD cohort), ACT 
(asthma cohort) 
• monthly PROactive -using the C-PPAC 
• For COPD only: EXACT PRO daily symptoms [ERS-COPD] 
• To assess the relationships between EHR-based healthcare utilization (ambulatory care visits 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217730]) and lab measures (specified below) with 
patient data remotely collected via methods outlined in previous bullet, for example. 
o EHR spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] 
o Blood WBC, eosinophils, neutrophils (number and%) 
o Other blood biomarker samples if available (e.g. fibrinogen, CRP, periostin, sRAGE etc)

3.[ADDRESS_261268] Participation 
Subjects will participate in the study for approximately 6 months. 
3.4.2 Approximate Duration of Study 
200 patients will be enrolled over an eight-month period, including 100 in the asthma cohort 
and 100 in the COPD cohort. Each patient will be followed for approximately six months after 
consent and enrollment into the study. 
3.5 Data Source/ Data Collection 
Integrated EHR records (primary and specialty care) are the key source for retrospective 
analysis and for identifying patients. Digital data collection from patient reports, devices, 
sensors, and EHR records over six months are the key sources for the prospective analysis. A 
summary of variables to be extracted is included in Section 6.4. The study database will be 
housed on a third-party vendor's secure network. Data from the study devices, including the 
mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_201992], the sensors for rescue and maintenance medications, activity 
monitors, and the ePRO platform will flow directly to the database on Vendor A's network . EHR 
data will be extracted and combined with device data in the database housed on Vendor A's 
network .'Vendor A will de-identify the study database and send the data set to Vendor B. 
Participants will provide  staff with feedback on the study, the study devices, and 
ePRO platform during the study Exit Interview. 
 data is part of the mini-sentinel monitoring system which means their 
data set meets standard criteria for data integrity and quality . 
3.6 Endpoints

3.7 Sample Size/ Power Calculation 
This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of measuring patient experience with new data 
collection methods and the association between new methods and the EHR-defined variables 
regarding disease severity and healthcare resource utilization, therefore no comparisons or 
hypothesis testing will be performed. In order to collect adequate information about the 
feasibility of these new data collection methods, approximately 200  
 patients will participate in the study (100 in each group COPD and asthma). If we assume 
a dropout rate of at most 25%, we will have complete data on at least [ADDRESS_261269] 
deviations, medians and interquartile range (IQR), and for categorical variables, normally 
distributed and non-normally distributed continuous variables, respectively. Spearman 
correlations will also be assessed between endpoints. The following will be analyzed over the 
study period: 
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (mobile and clinic) 
o Change from baseline in FEVl 
• Activity 
o Median/mean steps per day 
o Median/mean daily activity level based on vector magnitude units (VMUs) 
• PROactive total score and subdomains Symptoms 
• E-RS:COPD symptoms Exacerbations (COPD cohort only) 
o EXACT-defined events 
• HCRU 
o Median/mean number of primary care visits for COPD/asthma conditions 
o Median/mean number of secondary care visits (inpatient, urgent care and ED 
visits) for COPD/asthma conditions 
o Median/mean number of all primary care visits 
o Median/mean number of all secondary (inpatient, urgent care and ED visits) care 
visits 
o Summary of new prescriptions for any COPD/asthma treatments 
o Number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217733]/asthma 
o Number of albuterol inhalers (adjusted to equivalence of 200 actuations) 
prescribed 
• ePRO 
o Mean change from baseline in CAT (COPD cohort) 
[ADDRESS_261270] (asthma cohort) 
All analyses will be described in more detail in the full statistical analysis plan. 
5 LIMITATIONS 
Participants included in this study will be selected from among those within the  
 (IDN), therefore may not be representative of a sample of all COPD and asthma 
patients from the US. There will likely be a selection bias based on which patients are willing to 
participate in a study with multiple devices . Medication use and activity will be monitored 
using sensors so there is a risk that the patient's behavior may be altered. 
[ADDRESS_261271], MANAGEMENT & ETHICS

activities via the study consent form. 
6.3 Data Protection 
All data collected in this study will be strictly confidential in accordance with all appropriate 
legislation. Data from study devices and ePROs will be encrypted and automatically transmitted 
to Vendor A. EHR data, including PHI such as names, dates, and MRNS, will also be encrypted 
and sent to Vendor A via a  approved, secure portal. Vendor A's Insight Platform 
maintains a HITRUST certification to protect patient data. Vendor A will integrate the data from 
study devices, ePROs, and  on their secure network. Vendor A will de-identify 
the integrated study data set and transfer the de-identified data set to Vendor B. 
Study staff will be instructed to maintain complete confidentiality of all collected data. Patient 
files will be kept on secure servers. The final study report will not contain any patient 
identifying information. Participants will be assigned a unique participant number in the final 
data set to ensure confidentiality and anonymity. Interview transcripts will be identified by [CONTACT_217741].

· 6.4 Personally Identifiable Information (PII) 
The final data set will be de-identified and will not contain PHI. However, Vendor A will have 
access to participant names, dates, and MRNs to integrate data from multiple data sources 
including study device data, ePRO, EHR data, and Exit Interview transcripts. Vendor A will remove 
PHI elements from the dataset. PHI accessed for recruitment will only be seen by  [CONTACT_3655]. 
The final data set, housed by [CONTACT_217742] B, will be de-identified. 
The data in the table below, including relevant dates, will be collected. The table also outlines

6.5 Adverse Event {AE), Pregnancy Exposure, and Incident Reporting 
While this study does not involve the direct solicitation of adverse experience information, it is 
possible that participants could spontaneously describe potential adverse events that occurred 
during the course of their normal clinical care. 
As part of the site orientation process, study team members will be trained in the recognition of 
potentially-reportable adverse events. 
If an AE (serious or non-serious) or product complaint is reported spontaneously by a subject 
during the course of the study and the subject associates the AE with any specifically named GSI< 
product, the following AE reporting process will be completed: 
• The site staff will complete the AE reporting form (including the patient study ID 
number, their age and sex, the patient's description of the adverse event, and the 
product the patient named). 
The site staff will transmit the report to the GSI< study team within 24 hours of being made aware 
of the AE. 
Patients will be asked about adverse events related to the use of the devices provided during the 
study (mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007], device sensor, activity monitor and tablet) at regular intervals via the 
study provided tablet. These data will not be monitored in real time and patients will be educated 
on the need to contact [CONTACT_217743].

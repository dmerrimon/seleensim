[CONTACT_760748]  24, [ADDRESS_1041803] clinical settings. However, a low oxygen carrying capacity from moderate anemia may be 
deleterious in patients with cardiac ischemia.  The potential for harm associated with anemia in 
patients with acute symptomatic coronary disease is supported by [CONTACT_760708]. 
Systematic reviews of clinical trials evaluating transfusion strategies in patients with known ischemic 
heart disease document the absence of high quality data, which has resulted in an ongoing 
controversy.  The lack of  high quality  evidence  to guide  transfusions  in patients  with acute  myocardial 
infarction has been cited in several major guidelines as well as by [CONTACT_760709].  
This multicenter trial, the Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion (MINT) trial, randomly allocates 3500 
patients with acute myocardial infarction and a hemoglobin concentration less than 10 g/dL to be 
treated either according to a liberal or restrictive blood transfusion strategy.  Patients assigned to the 
liberal transfusion strategy receive one unit of packed red blood cells following randomization and 
enough  blood  to raise  the hemoglobin  concentration to  10 g/dL or above  any time a concentration  less 
than 10 g/dL is detected. Patients assigned to the restrictive transfusion strategy are permitted to 
receive a transfusion if the hemoglobin concentration falls below 8 g/dL or if angina symptoms clearly 
related  to the anemia  occur  and are not controlled  with anti-anginal  medications.  Only enough  blood  is 
given to reach a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dL or relieve the symptoms. Transfusion is strongly 
recommended if the hemoglobin concentration falls below 7 g/dL.  
The transfusion  protocol  is followed  during  the index  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (up to 30 days).  Each  patient is 
contact[CONTACT_6811] 30 days for a comprehensive follow -up for assessment of several relevant clinical 
outcomes.  Patients are  contact[CONTACT_760710] 180  days to ascertain vital status  for assessment of six - 
month mortality . 
A3 Primary  Hypothesis  
The primary  hypothesis is that among patients  with an acute  myocardial  infarction and  a hemoglobin 
concentration  less than 10 g/dL, a  liberal  transfusion  strategy  with a threshold  of 10  g/dL reduces  the 
rate of the  composite outcome of all -cause  mortality  or recurrent  nonfatal acute  myocardial  infarction 
through 30 days following randomization compared to a restrictive transfusion strategy with a 
threshold of 7 to 8 g/dL.

A4 Purpose  of the Study  Protocol  
The purpose of the trial is to assess red blood cell transfusion strategies that are currently used in 
clinical practice and important medical events.  Red blood cells are a limited and expensive medical 
therapy.  Physicians  frequently  transfuse  patients  to maintain  specific  (and often  differing)  hemoglobin 
levels, despi[INVESTIGATOR_760643]. The study results, which will determine 
the benefit (or risk) of a liberal transfusion strategy, will influence the allocation of red blood cells 
worldwide.

B1 Prior  Literature  and Studies  
Blood transfusion is a common medical intervention.  In the [LOCATION_002], more than 16 million red 
blood cell units are  transfused annually  to 3.4  million patients.(1)  Worldwide 108  million units of blood 
are collected per year.(2) Of all transfusions, approximately 25% of all red cells transfused are given 
to patients with a primary diagnosis of cardiac disease(3) and 8% of all cardiology admissions are 
transfused  with RBCs.(4)  The economic  ramifications  of this frequent  intervention  are significant.  The 
latest estimates of the cost of a red blood cell unit range from $522 to $1183 (mean, $761 +$294).(5) 
The safety of transfusion with respect to transmission of infectious agents has increased greatly 
throughout the past two decades, and complications are rare.(6, 7)  
Anemia and Cardiac Disease: Generating evidence to guide transfusion threshold decisions in 
patients with myocardial infarction is especially important because coronary artery disease is so 
common,(8) anemia is  present frequently  in this setting, and is  associated  with increased  mortality. A 
study of 44,[ADDRESS_1041807] segment elevation myocardial infarction from 400 US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760646]  22.2%  of patients  had a hematocrit  <30%  (Hgb  <10 g/dL).(9)  In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69426] 10.4%  in 
patients with Hgb <10 g/dL compared to 2.7% in patients with Hgb >10 g/dL.(10)  In a second study 
involving 17,676 patients with acute myocardial infarction, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired anemia (Hgb <11 g/dL) 
developed in 20.1% of patients during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Patients with Hgb <9 g/dL had a strong 
association with mortality (odds ratio=3.39).(10) The mechanism of early mortality in patients with 
acute cardiac injury and anemia may be related to a low ischemic threshold leading to myocardial 
injury, congestive heart failure and ventricular arrhythmia.  
Accumulating evidence from clinical trials suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy is safe in 
most  clinical  settings(11 -14) with the possible  exception  of patients  with acute  coronary  syndrome.  
BBackground  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, [ADDRESS_1041808]  reviews  and guidelines  define  a restrictive  transfusion  strategy  as the administration  of red cells 
once hemoglobin falls below either 7 or 8 g/dL while a liberal strategy is most often suggested as a 
transfusion trigger of 10 g/dL.  
Pathophysiology: The AABB (formerly called the American 
Association of Blood Banks) guidelines on Red Blood Cell 
Transfusion recently recommended the use of restrictive 
transfusion triggers in most patients with the exception of 
those with an acute coronary syndrome.(15, 16) Their 
rationale  – in the absence  of randomized  trial evidence  – was 16

Preoperative  Hemoglobin  g/dL 
the large body of basic physiology and observational data would suggest that a restrictive strategy 
may be deleterious.  This is because oxygen delivery to the myocardium is flow dependent since the 
heart extracts a high percentage of oxygen.  Therefore, myocardial ischemia may be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_760647], especially in patients with coronary stenosis or active 
plaques.  Studies  performed  in canines  suggest  a decreased  ability  to tolerate  anemia  in the presence 
of coronary artery disease.(17 -19) Electrocardiographic changes consistent with ischemia are seen 
at hemoglobin concentration below 5 g/dL in normal animals but at 7 -10 g/dL with experimentally 
induced coronary artery disease.  
Data from patients who decline blood transfusion for religious reasons were congruent with animal 
data. In a retrospective cohort study that included 1,[ADDRESS_1041809] to death (p=0.03).(20)  In patients with underlying 
cardiovascular disease the adjusted odds of postoperative death began to rise sharply at Hgb level  
<10 g/dL while in patients without underlying cardiovascular disease there was a more subtle rate of 
increasing  risk below  10 g/dL (see Figure  1). This study  does  not address  whether  transfusion  would 
improve outcome.  
Transfusion could be harmful by [CONTACT_760711].  Transfusion has 
been shown to increase platelet reactivity and increase procoagulant proteins.(21) Stored red blood 
cells take time to replenish  2, 3 DPG levels  impairing  release  of oxygen(22, 23) and  have  low levels  of 
nitrous  oxide  impairing oxgen  delivery  and vasodilation.(24)  The membranes  of stored  red blood  cells 
may become deformed and plug microvascular vessels.(25, 26)

Systematic Reviews, Observational Studies:  We have identified or conducted systematic reviews 
of both observational studies and clinical trials.  As expected, a systematic review of observational 
studies in all patients found that blood transfusion was associated with increased mortality and 
morbidity.(27) Two recent systematic reviews focusing specifically on patients with myocardial 
infarction  identified  10 studies  (9 observational  and 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]) reporting  the effects  of transfusions  on 
mortality.(28, 29) Nearly all observational studies demonstrated an association between transfusion 
and higher mortality. The one exception was in a large study using Medicare billing data in 79,000 
patients with acute myocardial infarction.(30)  Transfusion was associated with a lower risk of death 
when patients had an admission hematocrit below 0.33 (equal to a hemoglobin concentration of 11 
g/dL)  (odds  ratio=  0.69;  95% CI, 0.53-0.89)  and relationship  between  transfusion  and better  outcomes 
increased as the hematocrit fell. Indeed, based on subgroup analyses, the authors of the systematic 
review report that the adverse effects of transfusion appear to be mitigated in patients with a 
hematocrit less than 0.33.  Unfortunately, observational studies cannot be used to evaluate the effect 
of red blood cell transfusion since the use of blood transfusion is a marker for illness burden.(29, 31) 
Thus, no matter how refined the adjustment is for differences in illness burden, it is difficult, if not 
impossible, to completely adjust for differences between patients receiving and not receiving blood 
transfusion.  
Systematic Reviews, Clinical Trials:  We have performed a systematic review of clinical trials 
evaluating transfusion triggers in a variety of populations that were published in the Cochrane 
database(32) and JAMA.(33) We have updated the review (34) and found that compared with higher 
hemoglobin transfusion thresholds (~10 g/dL), a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 or 8 g/dL is 
associated with fewer red blood cell units transfused (mean difference, -1.22 units per patient), 
without adverse associations with mortality, cardiac morbidity, functional recovery, or length of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836].  The relative  risk for the association  of restrictive  versus  liberal  transfusion  on 30-day all- 
cause mortality was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.20).  
A recent meta -analysis of 11 selected trials enrolling patients with cardiovascular disease (including 
data obtained from authors from four trials) was recently reported. The risk ratio for the association 
between  transfusion  thresholds  and 30-day mortality  was 1.15 (95%  confidence  interval  0.88 to 1.50), 
but the  risk of acute  coronary  syndrome in patients in the  restrictive compared with liberal transfusion 
group was increased in nine trials (risk ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.70).(35).  This 
analysis is limited by  [CONTACT_760712] 27% of the  eligible trials.  The results  of 
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 16  
  
a meta -analysis in cardiac surgery patients reports trend favoring liberal transfusion (36) but the 
results  conflict  with another  analysis  in cardiac  surgery  patients  in which  no trend  was evident.  (34) 
Clinical  Trials  in Acute  Coronary  Syndrome : Our systematic  review  identified  two pi[INVESTIGATOR_760648].  The first was a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_760649] 
45 patients with acute myocardial infarction.(37)  Patients with hematocrit less than 30% were 
randomly allocated to a liberal (hematocrit <30%) versus restrictive (hematocrit < 24%) transfusion 
threshold.  The primary clinical safety measurement of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473], recurrent myocardial 
infarction, or new  or worsening congestive heart failure occurred in 8 patients in the liberal arm and 3 
in the restrictive arm (p< 0.046). There were [ADDRESS_1041810],  the MINT  pi[INVESTIGATOR_760650]  110 patients  and found  the pre-defined  primary  outcome  of death, 
myocardial  infarction, or  unscheduled  revascularization  within  30 days  occurred  in 6 patients  (10.9%) 
in the liberal -transfusion strategy and 14 (25.5%) in the restrictive -transfusion strategy p=0.054).  
Death  at 30 days  was less frequent  with liberal  transfusion  1 (1.8%)  compared  to restrictive 
transfusion 7 (13.0%); p=0.032.  
Overall, there were 2 deaths in the liberal transfusion strategy and 9 deaths in the restrictive 
transfusion  strategy  (relative  risk=  3.74,  95% CI 0.80-17.49;  p=0.09)  when  the two trials  in acute 
coronary syndrome are combined.  
Other Trials (38) with Signal of Harm from Restrictive Transfusion : The two most recently 
published trials also found a higher mortality in patients in the restrictive transfusion group in patients 
with ischemic heart disease.  The Titre2 trial contrasted liberal transfusion (9 g/dL) and restrictive 
transfusion  (7.5 g/dL)  in postoperative  patients  undergoing  cardiac  surgery.  The short -term outcomes 
were comparable between the transfusion strategies, but at 90 days follow -up, overall mortality was 
higher in the restrictive transfusion strategy than the liberal transfusion strategy (hazard ratio=1.64; 
95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 2.67, p=0.045).  In a cluster randomized trial in 939 patients with GI 
bleeding, the mortality was trending higher in subgroup of patients with underlying ischemic heart 
disease; liberal transfusion strategy was 3% and in the restrictive transfusion strategy was 12% 
(difference =10.7%; 95% confidence intervals -9.8 to 31.2; interaction p=0.11)  
Variation in Transfusion and Guidelines : The systematic reviews of observational studies and 
randomized  trials  evaluating  the impact  of anemia  and transfusion  highlight  the lack of  any study  with 
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, [ADDRESS_1041811] segment elevation 
myocardial infarction from 400 US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600](9) and 17,676 patients with acute myocardial infarction 
demonstrate substantial variation in transfusion.(10) Similar variation was observed in over 19,315 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9645] a discharge diagnosis of myocardial infarction during 2009 -2012 from the 
[LOCATION_004]  Kaiser  Permanente  Health  System  (Percent  transfused  at nadir  hemoglobin  level >10 g/dL, 
0.2%; 9 -9.9 g/dL, 12.5%; 8 -8.9 g/dL, 48.9%; 7 -7.9 g/dL, 78.3%; < 7 g/dL, 91.5%). (39)  A significant  
proportion of patients had transfusion thresholds at every cut -off from 7 to 10 g/dL. An updated 
analysis demonstrates variation in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760651] 17,676 patients with myocardial 
infarction (40) and transfusion among 34,937 patients with a myocardial infarction hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107831] 2000 -2008 in 57 centers. (41)  In a retrospective cohort study based on the CathPCI 
Registry  data from 2009  to 2013,  the risk adjusted  rates  of transfusion  by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_760652] 0.3%  to 
9.3%.  (42) The high transfusion  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760653]  a threshold  between  9 to 10 g/dL, and  low transfusion 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760654] a threshold between 8 to 9 g/dL.  More contemporary data in cardiac surgery patients 
from 2013 show continued variation in transfusion practice. (43)  
The variation in transfusion practice may further be exacerbated by [CONTACT_760713].  While  all conclude  that there  are too few high-quality  studies, 
recommendations vary widely among organizations. The American Red Cross, AABB, British 
Committee for Standards in Haematology were not able to recommend a course of action,(44, 45) the 
American College of Physicians recommends 7 -8 g/dL in patients with heart disease but is silent in 
acute coronary syndrome patients;(46) the American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association suggests avoidance of transfusion unless hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL(47, 48); National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends 10 g/dL threshold in patients with coronary heart 
disease including patients with acute coronary syndrome (49), National Blood Authority of Australia 
recommends 8 g/dL threshold (50), and the European Society of Cardiology recommends transfusion 
only in case of compromised hemodynamic status and hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL.(51) The recently 
published guidelines from the AABB concluded that there was insufficient evidence in patients with 
acute MI and did not provide a specific recommendation,  (52) while the [LOCATION_006] National Clinical 
Guidelines Centre  recommended  transfusion  at 8 g/dL (53).  Given  the lack of high  quality  evidence  to 
guide transfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction, it is not surprising that there is variation 
in recommendations emanating from different organizations.

Version  7.1 18  
 
CStudy  Objectives   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_760655], there 
has been  a strong  and consistent  trend  towards reducing  the use of blood  transfusion  in the US. For 
example, red blood cell transfusions per 1000 US population fell by 13.9% between 2013 and 2015.  
(54) Data  from [LOCATION_004]  Kaiser  Permanente  Health  System  show  that in 70,189  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760656], the  frequency  of transfusion fell 25% between 2009 and  2013. (55)  The 
pre-transfusion  hemoglobin  in patients  with cardiovascular  disease  declined  from 8.1 to 7.6 g/dL.  This 
change in clinical practice may be due to the widespread implementation of blood management 
programs (54) and Choosing Wisely Campaigns which targeted “unnecessary” transfusions. (56)  
B2 Rationale  for this Study:  Equipoise  
Every day, clinicians encounter anemic patients who have acute ischemic heart disease where a 
decision to transfuse must be made.  However, clinicians do not know what to do because:  1) 
Observational studies and randomized trials have come to different conclusions and are flawed; 2) 
Pathophysiological arguments  can be made  for liberal and  restrictive strategies; 3) Some  clinical trials 
in other settings suggest  a restrictive transfusion approach is safe but other trials signal  the possibility 
of reduced mortality with liberal transfusion in patients with cardiac disease; 4) Guidelines provide 
conflicting  advice.  This has led to practice  variation(9,  57) and confusion  in the clinical  community  with 
no clear guidance on when to transfuse.  Thus, the NHLBI State of the Science expert panel 
concluded in March 2015 “equipoise  for transfusion thresholds persists  in patients with ischemic heart 
disease.” (58) The ACC/AHA guidelines for management of STEMI concluded, “the optimal 
hemoglobin level in the transfused patient is not known.”(47, 48)  Furthermore, the recently published 
guidelines by [CONTACT_760714] 
“judged to be insufficient” to recommend transfusion threshold.(16) Based on these findings and 
existing data there clearly is equipoise. For all these reasons, a high quality randomized trial to guide 
transfusion is urgently needed to answer this clinically relevant question.

10 To determine  whether  a liberal  (10g/dL)  transfusion  strategy  reduces  all-cause  mortality  at 6- 
months following randomization, compared to a restrictive strategy.  
C4 Rationale  for the Selection  of Outcome  Measures  
The study outcomes assess the clinically important benefits and harms of transfusion and anemia in 
vulnerable individuals with compromised myocardium. Blood transfusions may decrease ischemic 
injury and improve myocardial performance by [CONTACT_760715] - 
risk patients. However, transfusions may also harm patients. Blood transfusions acutely increase 
blood  volume  in patients  who may not adapt  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_760661]. The increased blood volume could also lead to higher risk of bleeding from 
increased intravascular pressure.  Blood transfusion is also associated  with immunosuppression and 
may lead to infection.  In addition, laboratory  data suggest  that transfusions  may not enhance  oxygen 
delivery and may be associated with increased platelet aggregation.  
If transfusion to maintain the hemoglobin concentration >10 g/dL does mitigate the clinical 
consequences of anemia in ischemic cardiac injury, there will be a reduction of mortality and 
reinfarction.  Higher hemoglobin concentrations might also reduce other sequelae of decreased 
oxygen  delivery  to the myocardium; unscheduled  coronary  revascularization,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760662], unstable angina, and cardiovascular mortality.

D1 Overview  or Design  Summary  
This is a randomized, unblinded, two group multicenter clinical trial.  Eligible study patients are 
randomized to receive either the liberal or the restrictive transfusion strategy.  Transfusion strategy 
assignment  is not blinded.  The transfusion  protocol is  followed  during the  Index  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (for up 
to 30 days).  Each patient will be contact[CONTACT_6811] [ADDRESS_1041813] occurred within the 30 days are identified and medical records will be obtained. The Clinical 
Events Committee, masked to treatment allocation, will adjudicate occurrences of myocardial 
infarction within the 30 -day window.  
Each of the transfusion strategies in this trial is routinely used in current medical practice.  Study 
patients will be followed while they are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (for up to 30 days) during which time 
hemoglobin  levels,  cardiac  biomarker  of necrosis  levels,  electrocardiograms,  and number  of units  of 
red blood cell transfusions administered will be collected.  
The transfusion  strategies  will be compared  for differences  in mortality,  cardiac  events  and other 
important morbidity, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134577] -admissions, and patient perceived quality of life.  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, [ADDRESS_1041814]  Selection  and Withdrawal  
 
2.a Inclusion  Criteria  
The eligible  study  population  includes  patients  who meet all  of the following  criteria: 1)  18 years  of age 
or older; 2) with either ST segment elevation myocardial infarction or Non ST segment elevation 
myocardial infarction consistent with the 3rd Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction criteria (38) 
that occurs on admission or during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 3) with a hemoglobin concentration less 
than 10 g/dL at the time of random allocation, and 4) the patient’s attending physician, with expertise 
in cardiovascular care, believes that both of the transfusion strategies are consistent with good 
medical care for the patient as determined by [CONTACT_5657]/her clinical judgement.  
To simplify the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, we will require a rise in cardiac biomarker 
values  [preferably  cardiac  troponin  (cTn)]  with at least  one value above  the upper  reference  limit of 
normal of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We anticipate (and will confirm) that the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760663] 99th percentile upper reference at all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
In addition to evidence of myocardial necrosis, we require patients to have at least one of the 
following: (1) symptoms of ischemia; (2) new/presumed new ST segment or T wave (ST -T) changes 
or new left bundle branch block (LBBB); (3) development of pathological Q waves; (4) imaging 
evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality; and/or (5) 
identification of an intracoronary thrombus by [CONTACT_89320]. (37)  We will include patients with Type 1 
(i.e., spontaneous MI presumably related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissuring, 
erosion, or dissection with resulting intraluminal thrombus in one or more of the coronary arteries, 
leading to decreased myocardial blood flow or distal platelet emboli with ensuing myocyte necrosis), 
Type  2 (i.e., secondary  to an ischemic  imbalance  such  that myocardial  injury  with necrosis  occurs  due 
to myocardial oxygen supply and/or demand mismatch),Type 4b (i.e., stent thrombosis at 
angiography), and  Type 4c (i.e., severe in -stent restenosis without evidence of thrombus).

Version  7.1 23  
  
2.b Exclusion  Criteria  
Patients will be excluded if any of the following criteria are met 1) uncontrolled acute bleeding at the 
time of randomization defined as the need for uncrossed or non -type specific blood; 2) decline blood 
transfusion; 3) scheduled for cardiac surgery during the current admission; 4) are receiving only 
palliative treatment; 5) if known that follow -up will not be possible at 30 days; 6) if previously 
participated  in MINT 7)  if currently  enrolled  in a competing  study  that interferes  with the intervention  or 
follow -up of MINT or enrolled in a competing study that has not been approved by [CONTACT_1036]; or 8) 
if the attending physician does not believe the patient is an appropriate candidate for the trial for any 
reason.  
Patients  who have  had an epi[INVESTIGATOR_760664] 10 g/dL, they are no longer actively bleeding, and they are otherwise still eligible.  
2.c Ethical  Considerations  
Both transfusion strategies assessed in this trial are widely used in clinical practice.  There is 
uncertainty about which strategy is better, and therefore there is clinical equipoise to conduct this 
study.  Furthermore,  at the time of recruitment,  the investigator  will request  permission  of the patient’s 
doctor to seek the patient’s consent and randomly allocate them to one of the transfusion arms.  
At the time consent is obtained, the clinical site study staff will also request the names and contact 
[CONTACT_760716] -up time points.  This will minimize loss to follow -up. This 
information will be retained at the clinical site and destroyed at the end of the trial.  
2.d Randomization  Method  and Blinding  
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will prepare the randomization schedules. Allocation of the 
transfusion intervention strategies will be in a 1:1 ratio.  Given the diverse patient mix among 
participating  clinical  sites,  the randomization  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_698010], and a permuted  block 
design  with random  block  sizes  will be used  to balance  treatment  assignments  within  each  clinical 
site. 
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 24  
  
Study  patients  and physicians  caring  for the patient cannot be  masked  to treatment  assignment  (i.e., 
administration of red blood cell transfusion). However, the central classification of the myocardial 
reinfarction component of the primary outcome is performed masked to assignment.  
2.e Subject  Recruitment  Plans  and Consent  Process  
The study recruits hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760665] (Type 1, Type 2, 
Type 4b, or Type 4c).  Prior to study initiation, each cardiologist at the clinical site will be personally 
contact[CONTACT_760717] [INVESTIGATOR_760666].  Patients  of physicians  who do not wish to participate  in 
the trial will not be approached for recruitment.  
Study  staff will identify  potential  study  patients,  confirm  that the physician  agrees  that the patient  can 
be randomized into the study (see script in Appendix 1) and approach the patient for consent.  
Surrogate consent, in accordance with local IRB rules, will be sought for each eligible patient who is 
not able  to grant  consent. A  substantial  number  of patients  eligible  for this trial are likely  to be critically 
ill, medicated, and/or cognitively impaired and unable to grant consent.  It is essential that these 
patients be included as physicians routinely face the dilemma of whether or not they should be 
transfused.  
2.f Risks  and Benefits  
In patients with heart disease, risks and benefits are considerably different than most other patient 
populations.  Oxygen delivery to the myocardium is flow dependent since the heart extracts a high 
percentage of oxygen and myocardial ischemia may be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_760667], especially in patients with acute myocardial infarction.  Anemia, if untreated may 
result in increased risks of further myocardial ischemia and injury. Transfusions, on the other hand, 
may result in increased risks of pulmonary edema and heart failure (Transfusion -Associated 
Circulatory  Overload),  from the significant amounts of volume  given  to patients with  impaired  ability of 
the heart  to pump  (systolic  dysfunction)  or ability  to relax  and fill (diastolic  dysfunction).  Other  adverse 
effects of allogeneic blood transfusion were also a concern: immunologic (transfusion -related acute 
lung injury [TRALI],(59) and transfusion -related immune modulation [TRIM] possibly leading to 
increased bacterial infections).(60) Thus, there is clinical equipoise because it is unclear whether the 
benefits of immediate correction of anemia with transfusion are outweighed by [CONTACT_760718].

Version  7.1 25  
  
2.g Early  Withdrawal  of Subjects  from  Transfusion  Strategy  and Trial 
Procedures  
The study  participant  (i.e. patient)  can be withdrawn  from the transfusion  strategy  (liberal  or restrictive 
transfusion allocation) at any time, either at the request of the treating physician or the patient 
themselves.  The clinical site director may also withdraw a patient. Following the withdrawal, all 
transfusion decisions will be per treating physician.  The patient or physician may also request 
withdrawal from any trial procedure or follow -up. 
2.h When  and How  to Withdraw  Subjects  
There are few reasons why a patient or physician might want to withdraw from the trial.  If the patient 
has an adverse  effect  from a  prior transfusion or proves to be  difficult to cross match, the physician  or 
patient may choose to withdraw from the study.  However, the most common reasons are likely to be 
patient’s preference not to participate in research or desire not to have extra blood tests or be 
contact[CONTACT_51095] -up. If a concern is raised and a request for withdrawal is made by [CONTACT_760719], study staff will confirm the issue (e.g., transfusion strategy, study required 
measurements and/or telephone follow -up) and try to address the concern.  Study staff will be 
required  to contact [CONTACT_760720] [INVESTIGATOR_760668].  If appropriate, the patient  will 
be given the opportunity  to refrain  from the objectionable study  procedure(s) and  remain in  the overall 
study. All efforts will be made to avoid a participant feeling unduly pressured to remain in the study. If 
no intermediate solution is acceptable to the patient and/or treating physician, the patient will be 
withdrawn from the study.  The study staff will document the date of withdrawal, any known reasons 
for withdrawal  and whether  the patient will  continue  with any of the study  procedures and/or  follow -up. 
All treating  physicians  will be immediately  notified  of a withdrawal  from the transfusion  strategy  (liberal 
or restrictive transfusion allocation).  
2.i Data  Collection  and Follow -up for Withdrawn  Subjects  
At the time of withdrawal, the study staff will request permission to continue with data collection and 
follow -up through  the 6-month  study  time window.  However, the  exact  amount  of follow -up performed 
will vary in accordance with the patients’ authorization.  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 26  
  
D3 Trial  Transfusion  Strategies  
 
3.a Description  
We are comparing two commonly used approaches to transfusion therapy, both of which can be 
considered  as “standards  of care.” For  both strategies,  blood  must  be administered  one unit at a time 
followed by a hemoglobin measurement. The transfusion strategy will be followed throughout the 
index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83263] 30 days, discharge, or death.  
3.b Transfusion  Strategies  
Restrictive Transfusion Strategy : Patients randomized to the restrictive transfusion strategy will be 
permitted to receive a transfusion if the hemoglobin concentration falls below 8 g/dL and will be 
strongly recommended to receive transfusion if the hemoglobin concentration is below 7 g/dL. 
Transfusion  is also permitted  if angina  symptoms  (i.e., retrosternal  chest  discomfort,  chest  discomfort 
described as pressure or heaviness) that are thought by [CONTACT_760721] -anginal medications (sublingual nitroglycerin or equivalent therapy). 
Blood will be administered one unit at a time and enough blood given to increase the hemoglobin 
concentration above 7 to 8 g/dL or to relieve symptoms of uncontrolled angina.  
Liberal Transfusion Strategy : Patients randomly allocated to the liberal transfusion strategy will  
receive  one unit of packed  red cells following  randomization  and will receive  enough  blood  to raise  the 
hemoglobin concentration to 10 g/dL or above any time the hemoglobin concentration is detected to 
be below 10 g/dL. A post transfusion hemoglobin measurement showing a hemoglobin level of at  
least 10 g/dL must be obtained.  
A patient in either group may be transfused at any time without a hemoglobin level if the patient is 
actively bleeding (e.g., brisk gastrointestinal bleeding) and the physician believes an emergency 
transfusion  is needed.  A patient  in either  group  with history  of congestive  heart  failure  or low ejection 
fraction may receive diuretics prior to or after transfusion.  
3.c Rationale  for Transfusion  Thresholds  
The restrictive  transfusion  group  reﬂects  many  current  guidelines  (including  European  guidelines)(51, 
61). A blood transfusion will be permitted in the restrictive group if the hemoglobin concentration is 
less than 8 g/dL. Discussions with many cardiologists suggested that many clinicians are not  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 27  
  
comfortable  with a threshold  as low as 7 g/dL (as  used  in TRICC);  however,  individual  clinicians  may 
choose to use  a threshold of less  than 7  g/dL to trigger transfusions.  Patients may  be transfused  for 
signs or symptoms when the clinician believes it is necessary although this did not occur in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_760669].  
In the liberal transfusion group, a threshold of less than 10 g/dL was chosen because oxygen delivery 
to the myocardium is flow dependent and myocardial ischemia may be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_760670].  Studies 
performed  in canines found electrocardiographic  changes  consistent  with ischemia as  high as 10  g/dL 
with experimentally induced coronary artery disease. Data from patients who decline blood  
transfusion  for religious  reasons were  congruent  with animal  data and found  the odds  of death  rose as 
the hemoglobin fell below 10 g/dL.  
3.d Method  for Assigning  Subjects  to Treatment  Groups  
Clinical site staff will obtain the randomly assigned transfusion strategy for each eligible consented 
patient using the  MINT website. The  randomization system  will be available via a secure  area of the 
MINT project website with access restricted to those clinical site personnel with permission to 
randomize patients.  Those who are certified to use the randomization system will be trained to 
adhere to a strict randomization protocol.  In particular, the clinical site personnel must confirm the 
patient’s eligibility status in the system before a transfusion strategy assignment is provided.  If the 
web-based  randomization  system  is not accessible,  clinical  site personnel  will be instructed  to follow 
back -up procedures in order to ensure that the clinical centers are able to randomize patient 24/7.  
3.e Preparation  and Administration  of Red Blood  Cell Transfusions  
All red blood cell units are maintained and ordered through the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449057].  The storage 
solution and storage time will be at the discretion of the blood bank, but only leukoreduced red blood 
cell transfusion will be used.  The transfusions are administered by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_760671].  Study  staff will  alert the nursing  and medical  staff to the assigned  transfusion  strategy 
each time a new  patient has been enrolled in the  study. Treating staff will order (or not order) red cell 
transfusions in accordance with the protocol.  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, [ADDRESS_1041815]  Compliance  Monitoring  
There  are two primary  site based  mechanisms  to ensure  adherence  to the assigned  transfusion 
strategy 1) study staff review  of the medical record and, if necessary, direct discussion with the 
treating physicians and, 2) direct assistance from the blood bank.  
The clinical site is to obtain a daily hemoglobin level for each randomized patient for the first three 
days following randomization (or through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], if sooner). Additional hemoglobin levels 
are measured as clinically indicated.  Study staff will closely monitor each patient to ensure that each 
of the required hemoglobin levels are drawn, review the results, and confirm that the transfusions 
have been ordered (or not ordered) in accordance with the transfusion assignment.  If there is a 
hemoglobin value that should trigger a transfusion and none is ordered or, as the alternative, a 
transfusion ordered without a hemoglobin value to trigger the transfusion, study staff will discuss the 
case with the treating physician.  Likewise, if a required hemoglobin level has not been ordered, the 
study  staff will alert the physician.  The required  hemoglobin measurements  are of primary  importance 
to verify that patients in the liberal strategy maintain a level of at least 10 g/dL.  
The clinical  site will also request assistance  from the blood bank  to help prevent protocol  violations in 
the restrictive strategy.  Study staff will notify the blood bank each time a patient is assigned to the 
restrictive strategy and request notification prior to the release of any red blood cell transfusions that 
are ordered.  The study staff will then review the medical record to verify that the transfusion is in 
accordance with the protocol.  If administration of blood is a violation of the protocol, study staff will 
contact  [CONTACT_760722].  However, 
study staff do not approve or disapprove the transfusion. The final decision on the transfusion is 
always the treating physician’s.  
Study wide, the DCC will centrally monitor transfusions and hemoglobin levels on an ongoing basis. 
Transfusion  rates  for each  strategy  will be measured  overall  and by [CONTACT_698010]. Specifically, the  DCC 
will identify  instances  when  1) patients  randomized  to the liberal  strategy  do not receive  a transfusion,  
2) patients  randomized  to the liberal  strategy  are discharged  with a hemoglobin  level < 10 g/dL and, 
3) patients  randomized  to the restrictive  strategy  without  anginal  symptoms  and a hemoglobin  level ≥ 
8 g/dL receive a transfusion. Reports of the protocol violations will be prepared by [CONTACT_15791]. The 
Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) will review these reports and discuss as necessary with the 
clinical sites.  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 29  
 
EStudy  Procedures   
3.g Prior  and Concomitant  Therapy  
Transfusion prior to randomization is at the discretion of the clinicians.  An otherwise eligible patient 
may be randomized  as long as the hemoglobin  level is <10g/dL,  regardless  of prior transfusions at  the 
time of randomization.  Once the patient has been randomized all red cell transfusions are 
administered per the study protocol.  The protocol will not control the administration of other blood 
products including platelets or fresh frozen plasma. Similarly, it will not mandate specific medical or 
procedural treatments to manage these patients.  
3.h Blinding  of Study  Intervention  
Due to the nature of the interventions, study patients and physicians caring for the patients cannot be 
blinded  to transfusion  assignment.  However,  transfusion  strategy  assignment  will be concealed  during 
the central classification of the myocardial reinfarction component of the primary outcome.  
 
E1 Screening  for Eligibility  
Several  approaches  to screening  for study  patients will  be used.  Study  staff will  review  the results  of 
all troponin levels daily.  Medical records for patients with values above the upper reference limit of 
normal are reviewed and assessed  for eligibility. Study staff will screen all admissions to the cardiac 
care unit, and scheduled for cardiac catheterization. The physician of each eligible patient with a 
hemoglobin level <10 g/dL will be contact[CONTACT_760723]  a standardized  script  (Appendix  1), and consent  will be sought.  Study  staff will follow  otherwise 
eligible patients with hemoglobin levels ≥ 10 g/dL and consent the patient if the hemoglobin level 
drops to the entry level.  
E2 Schedule  of Measurements  
Each randomized patient is required to have hemoglobin levels, troponin levels, and 
electrocardiogram  readings  at specified  time points  (while  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  The blood  samples  will 
normally be drawn with the daily morning blood phlebotomy.  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 30  
  
The required time points for hemoglobin levels  are: 1) within 24 hours prior to randomization 
(eligibility  hemoglobin  level),  2) day [ADDRESS_1041816] randomization,  3) day [ADDRESS_1041817] randomization,  4) day [ADDRESS_1041818] 
randomization.  
The required  time points  for the troponin  levels  are: 1) within  24 hours  prior to randomization, 2)  12 
hours following randomization, 3) day [ADDRESS_1041819] randomization, 4) day [ADDRESS_1041820] randomization, 5) day [ADDRESS_1041821] randomization.  
The required  time points  for the ECGs  are: 1)  within  24 hours  prior to randomization, 2)  day [ADDRESS_1041822] 
randomization, 3) day [ADDRESS_1041823] randomization, 4) day [ADDRESS_1041824] each patient at 30 days following randomization.  In 
general, the 30 -day follow -up will be administered by [CONTACT_756], but the follow -up questions could be 
administered in person.  The follow -up interview will include questions about the patient’s health and 
quality  of life  during  the follow -up interval  and will determine  if there  have  been  any re-admissions  to a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79638] 30 days of randomization.  Local site staff will obtain the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760672] - 
admission.  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 31  
  
There will be a 30 -day window (from 30 days to 60 days following randomization) for study staff to 
obtain  the 30-day follow -up information.  In the event  they are not able  to contact  [CONTACT_174203], 
they will try to reach the alternate contacts that have been provided, and a letter will be sent to the 
patient if needed.  
E5 Follow -up at [ADDRESS_1041825] at 6 months following 
randomization  to determine  the patient’s  vital status.  There  will be a 30-day window  (from  180 days  to 
210 days  following randomization)  to obtain  the 6-month  information.  In the event that  study  staff are 
not able to contact [CONTACT_760724] 6 -month time point, they will follow the same procedure outlined 
at the 30 -day follow -up. 
E6 Safety  and Adverse  Events  
 
6.a Safety  and Compliance  Monitoring  
The DCC will monitor key aspects of protocol compliance, and reports will be developed and 
disseminated to monitor the ongoing progress of the study.  Protocol safety and compliance reports 
will include enrollment of ineligible patients, follow -up data collection outside of protocol -defined 
windows, deviations from the protocol, and adherence to established adverse event reporting and 
event  adjudication  procedures.  Reports  will be provided  to the CCC,  the Steering  Committee,  and the 
DSMB on a systematic basis.  
6.b Medical  Monitoring  
The DCC  is responsible  for tracking  the Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs)  reported  by [CONTACT_760725].  The DCC will track the time for each step of the process to ensure that turnaround 
times  adhere  to acceptable  reporting  practices  specified  by [CONTACT_760726]. The current  reporting 
guidelines from NHLBI ( https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/funding/human -subjects/adverse -event ) 
will be followed, and the timelines are included in Appendix 3.  
i Investigator  Only  
The clinical  site will submit a  SAE form to the DCC  for unexpected  serious  adverse events  occurring 
within [ADDRESS_1041826]  MINT in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760673] -up data collection  forms.  
ii Independent  Expert  to Monitor  
The DCC  will notify  the MINT Medical  Safety  Officer of unexpected  SAEs  submitted  by a clinical  site 
and make  the relevant  information  available  to the officer.  The Medical  Safety  Officer  will determine  
a) the severity of the event, b) the unexpectedness, and c) the relatedness to the study protocol.  In 
accordance with safety reporting regulations, all SAEs that are determined by [CONTACT_760727], probably  or definitely related  to the  study  protocol will be 
subject to expedited reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), NIH, and any other 
oversight entities as appropriate.  The NIH Project Officer and the DSMB chairperson will review 
these  documents  and may decide  to convene  the DSMB  to discuss  issues  related  to monitoring  such 
events.  
iii Independent  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  
An external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of members appointed by [CONTACT_729468], Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) will monitor the study, advise the NIH Program 
Office and provide input to the Steering Committee.  The MINT DSMB will include experts in 
cardiology, transfusion medicine, biostatistics and ethics.  The DSMB will review the study protocol 
and provide  NHLBI  with recommendations  including  whether  the protocol  and patient  recruitment  can 
be initiated.  NHBLI will approve the study protocol based on the DSMB recommendations before 
patient recruitment is initiated. Throughout the course of the trial, the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) will review recruitment, retention, data completeness, and protocol deviations on a 
semi -annual basis and will provide recommendations to NHLBI.  
Adverse events will be monitored in four distinct ways: 1) the DSMB will review all reported adverse 
events and monitor the incidence rates of adverse events on a semi -annual basis, 2) the expedited 
review of unexpected Serious Adverse Events (SAE) that are related to the MINT protocol and 
unanticipated problems (UP), 3) all study  outcomes will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_760728] -annual  basis,  and 4) a formal  statistical  interim  monitoring  of the efficacy  of the primary  outcome 
by [CONTACT_760729].  If unexpected safety concerns 
arise from the trial data or from external research or literature, safety data will be examined on an ad 
hoc basis. The DCC will work with the NIH and with the DSMB to make certain that the board  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, [ADDRESS_1041827] its primary aims, the DSMB will 
review  an interim  sample  size/power  analysis  after half of the patients  complete  the 30-day follow -up. 
Revised sample size estimates will be calculated based on the observed overall event rate (i.e. the 
two transfusion groups combined) and the proposed power and effect size.  
6.c Definitions  of Adverse  Events  
An adverse event is defined as an untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human 
participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom , or disease, temporally associated with a person’s participation in the research, whether or 
not considered  related  to a person’s  participation  in the research.  A Serious  Adverse  Event (SAE)  is 
defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:  
• results  in death;  
• is life-threatening  i.e. places  a participant  at immediate  risk of death  from the event  as it 
occurred;  
• requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088];  
• results  in a persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity;  
• results  in a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect;  OR 
• any other  adverse  event  that, based  upon  appropriate  medical  judgment,  may jeopardize  the 
participant’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
An Unanticipated  Problem  (UP) is defined  as any incident,  experience,  or outcome  that meets  all of 
the following criteria:  
• Unexpected  in terms  of nature,  severity,  or frequency,  taking  protocol  research  procedures 
and participation population characteristics into consideration.  
• Related  or possibly  related  to a person’s  participation  in the research.  
• Places  participants  or others  at a greater  risk of harm  (including  physical,  psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 34  
  
6.d Classification  of Events  
 
i Severity  
The severity of the adverse event refers to the intensity of an event and is categorized as 1) Mild; 
asymptomatic or  mild symptoms; clinical  or diagnostic  observations  only; intervention  not indicated, 2) 
Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental 
activities of daily living, 3) Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3526];  disabling;  limiting  self-care activities  of daily 
living, 4) Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated, 5) Death related to AE.  
ii Relationship  
Relatedness refers to the extent to which an adverse event is considered to be related to the 
intervention or study procedures. An adverse event is considered related if there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the  event  may have  been  caused  by [CONTACT_164532].  Note  that the term “suspected ” is 
also means possibly, probably or definitely related to the intervention or study procedures.  
The following  definitions  apply  to relatedness:

iii Expectedness  
An unexpected event is one that has not been documented previously as an established adverse 
reaction  to the study  intervention and that is not recognized as part of the  natural progression of the 
disease.  A particular  event  may also be considered  unexpected  if it has a higher  severity  grade  than 
what has been documented or identified previously.  
6.e Data  Collection  Procedures  for Adverse  Events  and Unanticipated 
Problems  
The clinical  site staff will report all  serious  adverse  events  and unanticipated  problems  on the trial data 
collection forms.  These events include those related to red blood cell transfusion including those 
specified in the informed consent form and those that are related to recent myocardial infarction.  All 
of the expected SAEs are recorded on the in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597871] 30 -day follow -up data collection  
forms.  Site personnel are required to report and document all unexpected SAEs and unanticipated 
problems to the DCC. The DCC will send all unexpected SAEs (as reported by [CONTACT_779]) to the study 
Medical  Monitor  for final assessment  of severity,  relatedness,  and expectedness.  The Medical  Monitor 
will remain masked to the transfusion strategy while making his/her evaluation of the SAE.  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 36  
  
6.f Reporting  Procedures  
All reported  SAEs  and unanticipated  problems  will be included  in systematic  reporting  to the DSMB  on 
a semi -annual basis. This includes adverse events and problems previously transmitted through 
expedited reporting.  
The following three classes of events need to be reported to the NHLBI, the DSMB and the Local IRB 
in an expedited manner:  1) Fatal or life  threatening unexpected suspected  SAE, 2) Non -fatal, non -life 
threatening unexpected suspected SAE, and 3) Unanticipated problem. Fatalities that are related to 
blood transfusions must also be reported to the FDA within 7 days according to the guidelines 
(http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/B  
lood/ucm074947.htm ). 
The site personnel will compete and submit a SAE form to the DCC within 72 hours of learning of the 
event whenever the event is both serious and unexpected.  In cases where the event is not serious 
but places the patient at greater risk of physical, psychological, economic, or social harm, and is both 
unexpected and related to the study, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_760674] 14 
days of learning about the problem.  SAE forms are  forwarded along with relevant patient history data 
to the Medical  Monitor  for review. The  study  Medical  Monitor will  assess  the severity,  relatedness,  and 
expectedness of the event within 48 hours.  Following the Medical Monitor’s feedback on the 
expectedness and relatedness of the SAE, the DCC will complete an SAE report categorized as 
serious, unexpected and related.  A report will also be sent for unanticipated problems. The DCC will 
send the reports to the NHLBI DSMB Executive Secretary and the NHLBI Medical Monitor for review. 
All reporting (from the time that the Site learns about the event until it is reported to the NHLBI,  
DSMB, FDA and IRBs) will follow the NHLBI DSMB established timelines as specified in 
(https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/funding/human -subjects/adverse -event ) as shown in Appendix 3. 
If other SAEs are noted  to occur  with abnormally  high frequency  during the trial, these will be reported 
promptly by [CONTACT_760730], and the NHLBI DSMB Executive Secretary and the NHLBI 
Medical Monitor.  Upon receipt of an expedited report, the DSMB chair will decide whether the event 
should be discussed at the next scheduled DSMB meeting or discussed  as soon as possible at an ad 
hoc meeting.  
IRB actions  regarding  the MINT  trial will be communicated  to the NHLBI  Project  Officer  and NHLBI 
Executive Secretary in an expedited fashion.  If the IRB or ethics board at any MINT site, CCC or  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 37  
  
DCC takes action regarding the MINT trial (e.g., the IRB places a hold on the trial or suspends the 
trial), the site will report this to the CCC within [ADDRESS_1041828]  or report  information  about  adverse  events  that occur  more  than 30 -days  after 
randomization with the exception of death which will be reported through 6 months after 
randomization.  Reporting of Adverse events will cease at the conclusion of the MINT trial.  
E7 Study  Outcome  Measurements  and Ascertainment  
 
7.a Definitions  of Outcomes  
 
i Myocardial  Reinfarction  
Myocardial reinfarction will be classified by [CONTACT_760731]/American College of Cardiology Committee definitions. (47) Patients with 
reinfarction  will need  to demonstrate  a fall in the troponin  value  and then a subsequent  rise of at least 
20% with additional evidence (new ECG changes, imaging evidence, clinical history) as in the MI 
definition to  diagnose a  new event. Myocardial reinfarction will be classified as ST -segment  elevation 
or non -ST Segment elevation.  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 38  
  
ii Death  and Cause  of Death  
For each  death,  the cause will be determined by  [CONTACT_760732]  (47): 
cardiovascular death (e.g., congestive heart failure, dysrhythmia), noncardiovascular death (e.g., 
infection,  cancer),  or undetermined  cause  of death.  Information  about  the specific  cause  of death  will 
also be collected.  
iii Unscheduled  Coronary  Revascularization  (unstaged)  
Ischemia driven, unscheduled coronary revascularization (coronary artery by[CONTACT_760733]) 
within [ADDRESS_1041829]  if a coronary  revascularization  is planned  (staged).  All coronary  revascularization  procedures 
will be recorded, but an elective planned staged procedure will not be included as an outcome.  
Information  about  the reason  for the procedure  will also be collected  to ensure that  the 
revascularization was done to treat ischemic heart disease.  
iv Readmission  to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  overall  and for primary  cardiac  diagnosis  
All re-admissions  to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760675], 
and the primary diagnosis for each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468988]: ischemic cardiac diagnosis 
(e.g.,  myocardial  infarction,  unstable  angina),  non-ischemic  cardiac  diagnosis  (e.g. heart  failure)  or 
non-cardiac.  
v Unstable  Angina  
The MINT trial sites will use 2014 ACC/AHA Key Data Elements and Definitions for Cardiovascular 
Endpoint Events in Clinical Trials to define unstable angina. (47) To diagnose unstable angina 
requires  that four criteria  be met: 1) worsening  ischemic  discomfort,  2) unscheduled  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
3) negative  cardiac  biomarker,  4) objective  evidence  of myocardial  ischemia.  
 
vi Congestive  Heart  Failure  
Sites personnel will use 2014 ACC/AHA Key Data Elements and Definitions for Cardiovascular 
Endpoint  Events  in Clinical  Trials  to define  congestive  heart failure.  (47) New or worsening  symptoms 
of congestive heart failure on presentation (increasing dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, 
orthopnea), has objective evidence of new or worsening heart failure, and receives initiation or 
intensification of treatment specifically for heart failure.  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 39  
  
vii TIA or Stroke  
The 2014 ACC/AHA Key Data Elements and Definitions for Cardiovascular Endpoint Events in 
Clinical Trials will be used to define stroke. (47) A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as “a 
transient  epi[INVESTIGATOR_760676],  spi[INVESTIGATOR_127102],  or retinal  ischemia, 
without acute infarction.”  Stroke is defined on the basis of the presence of acute infarction as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_760734] 24 hours.  
viii Deep  Venous  Thrombosis  or Pulmonary  Embolism  
Deep  vein thrombosis  will be diagnosed  if duplex  ultrasound,  magnetic  resonance  venogram  (MRV), 
or venogram is definite or probable positive. Site investigators will record if location is proximal or 
distal. Pulmonary  embolism will be diagnosed  with a high probability  ventilation perfusion lung scan, 
CT scan, or pulmonary angiogram.  
ix Bleeding  
Major bleeding will be defined  as 1) fatal bleeding, and/or 2) symptomatic  bleeding in a  critical area  or 
organ, such as intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra - articular or pericardial, or 
intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or 3) bleeding causing a drop in hemoglobin 
concentration of 2 g/dL or greater (62) from the last hemoglobin concentration prior to randomization 
to the nadir  hemoglobin  concentration  during  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760677] [ADDRESS_1041830] randomization.  The 
drop in hemoglobin concentration will account for  each unit of red blood cell transfusion transfused by 
[CONTACT_18647] 1 g/dL for each unit administered.  
x Infections  
 
x.1 Pneumonia  
Pneumonia  will be diagnosed  using  CDC  criteria  (48) which includes  radiographic  abnormalities  and 
combination of symptoms (i.e.,  cough),  signs  (i.e., fever, tachypnea, or laboratory  abnormalities  (i.e., 
white blood cell count, hypoxemia).  
x.[ADDRESS_1041831] 1 of the following signs or symptoms: fever, chills, or hypotension and signs  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, [ADDRESS_1041832]  Infection  will be defined  using CDC  criteria  (48) which  include  one of the following signs 
or symptoms: fever (>38.0°C) or localized pain or tenderness, and laboratory evidence for infection.  
xi Length  of Stay  and Intensive  Care  Unit Days  
The trial will collect  the number  of days  post randomization  that patient is  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760678].  
xii Quality  of Life 
The EuroQol questionnaire (EQ -5D), a standardized instrument that measures health related quality 
of life  in 5 dimensions:  mobility,  self-care,  usual  activities,  pain/discomfort  and anxiety/depression,  will 
be used as a measure of patient perceived global health status [ADDRESS_1041833] 3 days  following  randomization  (or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760679])  active surveillance  is performed 
to ensure all occurrences of myocardial reinfarction are detected. It is required that the site obtains 
troponin  levels  (every  12 hours  for 1 day, and  then daily for the next 2  days)  and electrocardiograms 
(daily for the first 3 days).  These results, in combination with any additional cardiac biomarkers for 
necrosis and electrocardiograms and medical findings, will be reviewed by [CONTACT_760735], irrespective of a site identified event.  We will therefore be 
able to identify  myocardial  reinfarction  events  that were  not clinically  recognized,  in addition  to those 
had been.  
Study staff will contact [CONTACT_62086] [ADDRESS_1041834] cardiac  event the staff will submit de -identified copi[INVESTIGATOR_760680]  (from  either  the index  admission  or the readmission)  for the Clinical  Events Committee  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, [ADDRESS_1041835]  at 6 months  following randomization  to 
ascertain the patient’s vital status.  
 
 
 
E8 Baseline  and Intervention  Clinical  Characteristics  
Baseline demographic (e.g., age, gender, race), co -morbidity (e.g. cardiovascular risk factors), 
characteristics of cardiac disease (e.g., left ventricular function, number of coronary vessels 
obstructed),  renal  disease,  and medications  (e.g.,  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248],  P2Y12  receptor  inhibitor,  anticoagulant, 
beta-blocker statins) will be collected to reflect patient status at the time of randomization.  
Characteristics  describing  the study  intervention including  red blood  cell transfusion  information  (e.g. 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], leukoreduction, storage solution, ABO) will be recorded. In hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], hemoglobin 
levels and the number and timing of transfusions will be recorded for the two assigned transfusion 
strategies.  
 
 
 
F1 Sample  Size Determination  and Power  
In the MINT pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], the composite 30 -day rate of death and myocardial infarction was 16.4%.  
Higher  rates  were  observed  in the Kaiser  System  preliminary  data.  Thirty -day rates  of 16.4%,  18%, or 
20% are reasonable for this trial since the proposed study population will not exclude the sickest 
patients as was done in the MINT pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Using a two -sided inequality test and a simple chi - 
square statistic with alpha=0.05, we determined the samples sizes required to provide 80% and 90% 
power to detect varying relative reductions in the 30 -day event rates for death and myocardial 
infarction between the two assigned treatment groups. Based on these estimates, we plan to enroll a 
sample of 3500 patients. If the rate of missing outcome data is no more than 5%, the trial would have 
3324 patients with analyzable outcome data at 30 -days. Assuming an  overall event rate of 16.4%, the 
trial will have  80% power  to detect a  20% relative  reduction  (i.e. 18.2%  vs. 14.6%)  and >90%  power  to 
detect a 25% relative reduction. If the overall event rate  is 18%, then  the trial will have >80% power to 
detect a 20% relative reduction (i.e. 20% vs. 16%), and if the overall event rate is 20%, the trial will 
have close to 90% power to detect 20% relative reduction (i.e. 22.2% vs.  17.8%).  We also performed  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 42  
  
a simulation  study  to compute  the power  for a log binomial  model  with a  random  intercept  for site and 
a final alpha -level=0.045 to account for the interim monitoring.  We simulated 1000 trials where each 
trial had 60 strata representing the sites, 56 participants within each stratum (i.e. N=3360 patients in 
total), and a mean intra -class correlation (ICC) of 0.[ADDRESS_1041836] 81% power to 
detect a 20% relative reduction from 18.2% to 14.6%, and 90% power to detect a 25% relative 
reduction from 18.2% to 14.0%. In addition, the trial will have 85% power to detect a 20% relative 
reduction  from 20% to 16%,  and 89% power  to detect  a 20% relative  reduction  from 22.2%  to 17.8%.  
This pragmatic randomized clinical trial has excellent power to detect clinically meaningful differences 
between the two transfusion strategies with respect to the critical [ADDRESS_1041837] with either treatment strategy 
while maintaining the overall type I error at the pre -specified level.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_760681] (i.e. number of primary outcome events) that has accumulated by [CONTACT_760736] -spending function.  We recommend that the Lan -DeMets 
approach be used to allocate the type 1 error (i.e. alpha -level) at each interim time point and use of 
O’Brien  Fleming monitoring  boundaries.  The DSMB  may advise  early  termination  of the trial for safety 
reasons or make other recommendations regarding modifications to the protocol.  
The MINT trial will have 4 years of recruitment with a  goal of enrolling N=[ADDRESS_1041838] or 
September  of 2018, 2019, and  2020  based  on N=298  patients  enrolled  through June  1, 2018,  N=872 
patients enrolled through June 1, 2019, and N=[ADDRESS_1041839] statistic  is calculated  based  on the 
estimated relative risk from the log -binomial model which includes assigned transfusion strategy 
(according to the intention to treat principle) as the independent variable.  If the observed Z -test 
statistic crosses the boundary the difference is considered statistically significant at that monitoring 
time.  The “α spending function approach” allows the number and  frequency of monitoring times to  be 
changed at any point during the trial.  
Based  on the anticipated  accrual  shown  in Appendix  4, below  is the table  of the  expected  percent  of 
information, estimated number of participants, the Z -test statistic boundary level and the 
corresponding alpha spent based on the O’Brien -Fleming boundaries.

The O’Brien and Fleming (1979) repeated significance tests combined with the Lan and DeMets 
(1983) flexible alpha -spending curves are proposed due to their common usage and their 
conservative  nature  when  the amount of accumulated  data in the trial is small.  They  are designed  to 
stop earlier in the trial if there is overwhelming evidence that there is a difference between the two 
treatment groups.  The ability to detect a difference between the groups becomes easier as the 
amount of information in the trial increases.  
The form of the O’Brien -Fleming  alpha  –spending  function  is: 
𝜶(𝒌) = 𝟐 − 𝟐𝝓 (𝒁𝜶⁄𝟐) 
√𝒊𝒌 
where:  α(k) = cumulative  alpha  at inspection  k 
k = inspection number  
ϕ(x) = the cumulative  distribution  function  of the standard  normal  curve  evaluated  at x.

size estimates  from the trial hypothesis  (80%  power  to detect  a RR=0.80)  and on the observed  overall 
event rate (i.e. the two transfusion groups combined).  The DSMB will evaluate whether the trial 
sample size needs to be increased in order to restore power to maintain the ability to detect a  
clinically meaningful effect size.  

MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, [ADDRESS_1041841] 
implications, a null result from a well -powered trial would be important for establishing treatment 
guidelines and policy.  Thus, no interim futility analyses will be conducted in the MINT trial.  
F3 Analysis  Plan 
A Screening Log will be developed to include the number of patients with acute myocardial infarction 
and hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, eligibility and enrollment status. Proportions of eligible and enrolled 
patients will be presented, and reasons why patients are not eligible or enrolled in the trial will be 
tabulated.  Enrollment patterns will be compared across clinical sites and patient groups defined by 
[CONTACT_154329]/ethnicity.  The baseline characteristics and co -interventions of the patients who are 
randomized in the MINT trial will be described, and characteristics of patients in the two assigned 
treatment groups will be compared.  The proportion of enrolled patients who adhere to the assigned 
intervention will be ascertained by [CONTACT_760737][INVESTIGATOR_059]. The  intention -to-treat principle  will be used  to compare  the 
primary outcome (the composite of all -cause mortality and myocardial infarction by 30 days from 
randomization) and each pre -specified secondary outcome by [CONTACT_760738].  A select number of subgroup  analyses will be performed based  on baseline  factors identified 
prior to the initiation of the trial.  
F4 Statistical  Methods  
 
4.a Baseline  Characteristics  of the Enrolled  Patient  Sample  
Descriptive statistics will be examined for all relevant baseline measures collected on the MINT 
randomized patients. Transformations of measures will be considered on the basis of distribution 
diagnostics and outlier analysis.  The baseline characteristics and co -interventions of the patients in 
the overall  study  will be described  using  frequencies,  proportions,  means  and standard  deviations,  or 
medians and first and third quartiles.  Characteristics of patients in the two arms of the trial will be 
compared using chi -square statistics for categorical variables and t -tests or Wilcoxon rank -sum 
statistics for continuous variables.  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, [ADDRESS_1041842] -randomization will be compared 
between the assigned treatment groups with a Student’s t -test. Mixed random effect models will be 
used  to describe  the daily mean  hemoglobin  concentrations  during  the initial  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760682].  The mean 
number of red blood cell transfusions in each randomized treatment group will be described, and a 
simple Poisson test will be used to test whether the number of units of blood differs significantly by 
[CONTACT_760739].  
4.c Primary  Outcome  Analysis  
The intention -to-treat principle will be used for all randomized transfusion strategy comparisons of 
study outcomes.  A two -sided test will be used with an alpha -level=0.05 for the primary outcome, the 
composite of all -cause mortality and myocardial infarction (death/MI) by [ADDRESS_1041843] for clinical site.  The primary analysis will involve the estimated relative 
risk and significance level obtained from the model accounting for interim monitoring and missing 
data.  Event  rates,  the relative  risk and  the absolute  difference  will be from  the observed  data will also 
be presented, and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.  
If significant imbalances in baseline risk factors are detected between the two randomized treatment 
groups (p<0.05), multivariable log -binomial  regression will be used to adjust for potential confounding 
factors as a sensitivity analysis.  If adherence to the protocol is lower than expected, a per protocol 
analysis, including only  patients  who undergo  transfusion  according  to their assignment and  adjusting 
for baseline  factors  that are associated  with adherence  to the treatment  protocol, will  be conducted  as 
a sensitivity analysis.  
4.d Analysis  of Secondary  and Tertiary  Outcomes  
Event rates,  the relative  risk and the absolute  difference  between  transfusions  strategy  groups  for the 
dichotomous secondary and tertiary outcomes will be calculated with their 95% confidence intervals 
using log -binomial regression methods accounting for clinical site with random effects.  The length of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760683]-parametric  Wilcoxon  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 48  
  
rank sum tests, and long -term mortality will be analyzed with Kaplan -Meier methods and the log rank 
statistic.  The Kaplan -Meier  estimated  mortality  rate in each  treatment  group at  180 days,  the absolute 
difference between the assigned treatment groups at 180 days, and the 95% confidence interval for 
the difference will be presented.  Transfusion strategy comparisons of the EQ -5D quality life  
measures at [ADDRESS_1041844].  No adjustment of the 
alpha level will be made for the secondary and tertiary analyses. Rather the results will be interpreted 
based upon the observed findings, their designation as secondary or tertiary outcomes, and in 
comparison to the primary outcome result.  
The secondary outcomes include: 1) all -cause mortality within 30 days; 2) myocardial reinfarction 
within  30 days;  and 3) the composite  outcome  of all-cause  mortality,  nonfatal  myocardial  reinfarction, 
ischemia driven unscheduled coronary revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806]), or readmission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760657] 
30 days.  
The tertiary outcomes include: 1) all -cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial reinfarction, and unstable 
angina (i.e. acute coronary syndrome) 2) ischemia driven unscheduled coronary revascularization 
within 30 -days; 3) readmission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760684], 4) congestive heart 
failure within  30 days; 5)  unscheduled  readmission  to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760685]  30 days; 6)  each 
of the individual  cardiovascular  outcomes  of stroke, pulmonary  embolism  or deep  venous  thrombosis, 
and bleeding within 30 days; 7) each of the individual infectious outcomes of pneumonia, blood 
stream, and urinary tract within 30 days; 8) each of the individual in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760686]; 9) patient  reported  quality 
of life measures based on the EuroQol  questionnaire (EQ -5D) at 30 days; and 10) all -cause mortality 
at 6-months.  
4.e Missing  Outcome  Data  
For the analysis  of the  primary  outcome,  standard  multiple  imputation  methods  will be used  to impute 
missing [ADDRESS_1041845] non -missing death and MI data from randomization to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426634].  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation methods will be used to impute 
the missing  30-day outcome  values  (yes/no)  for death  and MI. Specifically,  a log-binomial  regression 
model to estimate the relationship between the outcome and key covariates (observed baseline and  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, 2017  
Version  7.1 49  
  
in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760687] “missingness” of the 30 -day 
outcomes) in the participants with full data. This model will be used to predict the probability of the 
outcome for participants who are missing the [ADDRESS_1041846] error.  As a sensitivity analysis, a log -binomial model with 
random effects for site will be created based on the non -missing 30 -day death/MI data.  Missing data 
will not be  imputed  for the analyses  of the  secondary  and tertiary  hypotheses  unless  critical  issues  are 
noted while investigating the missing 30 -day data.  
4.f Subgroup  Analyses  
Subgroup analyses will be performed based on baseline factors identified prior to the initiation of the 
trial. Clinically relevant subgroup variables include: ST segment elevation MI / non ST segment

[CONTACT_760740] -defined subgroup.  The reported 
significance -level will account for the number of treatment comparisons conducted in the study using 
the false discovery rate (FDR) algorithm developed by [CONTACT_633074].  In addition, for each 
subgroup variable, a log -binomial regression model including treatment assignment, subgroup  
variable and the interaction between the subgroup variable and treatment assignment will be created, 
and the significance of the interaction term will be used to test whether the randomized treatment 
effect is significantly modified by [CONTACT_760741].  Cox proportional hazards 
regression models will be created with similar covariates in order to test whether the effect of the 
randomized transfusion strategy for [ADDRESS_1041847]  and Main  Trial  Data  
In 2016, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) funded a MINT Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_760688], and  the clinical  sites are in Canada.  The DCC  and CCC 
have collaborated with the University of Montreal to ensure that the protocol (eligibility criteria,  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, [ADDRESS_1041848]  Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_760689], and outcomes) as well as the randomization scheme and the data to be collected are 
nearly identical to those for the main MINT trial.  The CIHR MINT pi[INVESTIGATOR_760690] 60 
patients.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_760691] a “Vanguard phase” for the MINT trial and will allow us to 
evaluate the feasibility of the MINT protocol.  After the MINT protocol is approved by [CONTACT_546533]/NHLBI  and the appropriate  ethics  committees  in Canada,  patients  randomized  at the Canadian 
Sites will be enrolled as MINT participants.  All data collection and data coordination for the MINT 
participants  will occur  through  the University  of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_760692].  Patients  who are randomized  prior to 
the transition date will remain CIHR pi[INVESTIGATOR_760693] -up. The complete 
Vanguard datasets housed at the University of Montreal will be transferred to the University of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_760694].  The Vanguard patient data will be merged with the MINT trial data based on  
rigorous comparisons of variable definitions and variable coding.  All Vanguard patients will be 
included in the target sample size and presented in DSMB and published data reports for the MINT 
trial. 
 
 
 
F5 Unblinding  Procedures  
Patients and providers are not blinded in the MINT trial, and thus unblinding procedures are not 
required  for patient  safety.  Trial monitors  and adjudicators  are blinded  to transfusion  strategy,  and the 
DSMB may choose to be blinded to transfusion strategy as they monitor the outcome data.  The 
Medical Monitor and DSMB can request to be unblinded if they deem this necessary.  
 
 
 
G1 Confidentiality  and Security  
Patient identifiers (e.g. name [CONTACT_172990]) will not be sent to the trial DCC, however, 
some  personal  health  information  (e.g. birth date and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760695])  will be collected 
centrally.  The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_760696] a strictly enforced security policy with standard 
operating procedures addressing key security risk areas.  Procedures include password protection, 
limited access to study computers, encryption, IP restriction, basic or digest authentication, and 
firewalls between the Internet and the DCC network and servers.  Regularly scheduled backups and  
MINT  Trial Protocol  October  24, [ADDRESS_1041849] information.  
G2 Training  
DCC  personnel  at the University  of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_760697]  / Robert  Wood 
Johnson to provide the training necessary for uniform data collection, protocol compliance, and data 
processing.  Major elements to be covered are inclusion and exclusion criteria, procedures and tools 
to monitor adherence to protocol, randomization procedures, event adjudication procedures, adverse 
event reporting, methods for extracting data from different sources, follow -up schedules, what to do 
about missing information, reporting requirements, and use of the Manual of Operations and study 
website.  Instruction will be provided for entering the data, transmitting them to the DCC, interpreting 
edit reports and correcting data.  
On-going  training will  be required  due to the addition  of new  clinical  sites as well as turnover  of staff  at 
the existing clinical sites.  The CCC and DCC will utilize webinars and conference calls to conduct 
detailed distance training sessions.  On-line protocol and data collection training modules will be 
available on the trial website, and focused training sessions will be conducted in conjunction with 
Steering Committee meetings as required.  Throughout the trial, there will be regularly scheduled 
conference calls with the coordinators and data collectors at all sites to discuss issues that arise with 
protocol and data collection.  
G3 Case  Report  Forms  and Source  Documents  
The data collection  forms  for this trial have  been  developed  to facilitate  enrollment and  follow -up while 
still collecting the essential information needed to answer the trial hypotheses. A web -based 
distributed data management system will be used for data entry.  Source documents will be 
maintained at the clinical site.

HStudy  Monitoring,  Auditing,  and Inspecting   
G4 Records  Retention  
Trial patient  records  will be retained  at the clinical  sites and at the Coordinating  Centers  for 6 years 
after MINT data collection is completed.  
G5 Performance  Monitoring  
The DCC will monitor study performance.  Routine reports will be developed to monitor the ongoing 
progress of the study including enrollment and retention. Protocol adherence reports include 
enrollment of ineligible patients, follow -up data collection outside of protocol -defined windows, and 
deviations  from protocol.  The timeliness  of data  collection  and data entry  is routinely  monitored  at the 
DCC using information entered into the data system (evaluation date and data collection date), and 
information stored in the systems inventory files (dates of entry, verification, and submission). The 
DCC will provide reports to the MINT CCC and clinical site coordinators including scheduling and 
delinquency.  Inadequate performance of a site will be reported to the CCC and the site.  The DCC 
and CCC will work with the site to find solutions to challenges.  The DCC and CCC will evaluate the 
performance  at that site to determine  whether  corrections  have  been  made.  Should  problems  persist, 
the Operations Committee will be notified along with recommendations for resolving persisting 
inadequacies.  Trial and site performance reports will be provided to the sites, the CCC, the Steering 
Committee, and the DSMB.  
 
H1 Study  Monitoring  Plan 
The CCC  will coordinate  the study  monitoring  site visits  to each  clinical site.  In addition,  the DCC  will 
conduct data monitoring site visits to clinical sites where specific data issues are identified or data 
concerns  arise based on  a risk-based  monitoring plan.  The risk-based  monitoring plan will be based 
on site performance metrics as well as the results of CCC safety and compliance monitoring visit.  
H2 Auditing  and Inspecting  
During monitoring site visits, CCC personnel will review source documents, including informed 
consent documents, for a random sample of patients and for a defined subset with an exceptional 
number  of inconsistencies  identified  through  the data monitoring  processes  to confirm  that data are

 L1 Appendix 1:  Standardized approach  and script to  be used  to 
seek  permission  from  attending  physician  to recruit  a patient  
 
 
For each  patient who  is potentially  eligible  for the trial, the  MINT  site investigator  or coordinator 
will contact  [CONTACT_102]’s  attending  physician,  with expertise  in cardiovascular  care, and  use the 
following script:  
“Dr. <name> I am calling to seek your permission to approach your patient <name> for 
consent to participate in the MINT trial.  This is an NIH -sponsored trial that enrolls 
patients with an acute myocardial infarction and a hemoglobin level <10.  According to 
the protocol, those assigned to the Liberal Arm receive red blood cell transfusions to 
maintain a hemoglobin level ≥ 10.  Those assigned to the Restrictive Arm will be 
permitted  to receive  a transfusion  if the  hemoglobin  concentration  falls below  8 g/dL and 
will be strongly recommended to receive transfusion if the hemoglobin concentration is 
below 7 g/dL and you determine that a transfusion is in the patient’s best  
interest.  Transfusion is always permitted for active bleeding or if there are angina 
symptoms  that you believe  are related  to the anemia  and are not adequately  controlled 
with medications.  Patients can be withdrawn from the transfusion protocol if clinical 
circumstance change and adherence to the protocol places the patient at risk.”  
“We want to confirm that <name> is an appropriate candidate for the trial; and that in 
your clinical  judgement both  approaches  to transfusion  are consistent  with good  medical 
care for this patient.”  
The first paragraph  of the script will  be used  the initial  time the trial team  contacts  the physician 
but could be skipped if the physician is already familiar with the protocol.  The second 
paragraph will be stated when contact[CONTACT_760745].  Patients will 
only be approached for consent if their physician confirms his/her belief that either transfusion 
strategy is appropriate, per the second paragraph.

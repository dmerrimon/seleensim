Acute low back pain. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_6829]. 10212020A randomized study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_6830]-radicular low back pain
In industrialized nations such as the United states, low back pain carries a lifetime prevalence of over 
80% and results in an aggregate 2.7 million annual visits to US emergency departments. (1,2) RCT’s 
comparing NSAIDS to placebo support the use of this medication as first-line treatment in patients with 
acute low back pain without sciatica. (3) Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], the magnitude of NSAID effectiveness remains 
small, leading patients with low back pain to report persistent pain, analgesic use, and functional 
impairment after an ED discharge. (3,4) Furthermore, the addition of other pharmacologic treatments 
such as oxycodone, muscle relaxants, and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_6832]. (5,6) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_6833], such as diclofenac, are effective in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain 
but have not been studied specifically in patients with low back pain. (9) 
The current literature reveals that topi[INVESTIGATOR_6834]. For example, an in vivo study comparing oral vs 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_6835] a 300-fold lower plasma 
concentration for patients receiving topi[INVESTIGATOR_6836]. (7) Multiple studies showed a statistically 
significant reduction in pain when topi[INVESTIGATOR_6837]. (8) Similarly, when used in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_6838] a significant reduction in pain after 2 to 4 weeks and no statistical difference 
when compared to oral diclofenac. (9) When used specifically for patients with acute back pain, a single 
study was carried out and showed promising results for the diclofenac patch, but this was open-label, 
uncontrolled, and generally of poor quality. (10)
Given the poor pain and functional outcomes that persist beyond an ED visit for acute musculoskeletal 
low back pain, we propose a clinical trial to test the following three hypotheses:
1) Combining topi[INVESTIGATOR_6839] + placebo gel, as measured by [CONTACT_6854] 2 days after ED discharge
2) Combining topi[INVESTIGATOR_6840] + oral placebo, as measured by [CONTACT_6854] 2 days after ED discharge
3) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_6841] + oral placebo and topi[INVESTIGATOR_6842] + oral ibuprofen will result in comparable
LBP functional outcomes, as measured by [CONTACT_6855] 2 days after ED discharge

Acute low back pain. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_6829]. 10212020Overview
This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative effectiveness trial in which we enroll 
patients during an ED visit for musculoskeletal LBP and follow them by [CONTACT_6856]. Patients will be randomized into one of three separate treatment groups: topi[INVESTIGATOR_6843] + 
oral ibuprofen, topi[INVESTIGATOR_6843] + placebo oral medication, oral ibuprofen + placebo gel. All 
patients will receive a 2-day supply of investigational medication.
Subject selection
Our goal is to include in this study a broad representation of patients with musculoskeletal back pain 
who are likely to respond to the investigational medications and who would not be considered 
candidates for spi[INVESTIGATOR_6844]. We hope for a widely generalizable 
study and therefore will not require diagnoses to be contingent on advanced imaging studies. 
Inclusion criteria:
-Present to ED primary for management of LBP, defined as pain originating between the lower border of 
the scapulae and the upper gluteal folds. Flank pain, that is pain originating from tissues lateral to the 
paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_6845], will not be included.
- Musculoskeletal etiology of low back. Patients with non-musculoskeletal etiologies such as urinary 
tract infection, ovarian cysts, or influenza like illness will be excluded. The primary clinical diagnosis, at 
the conclusion of the ED visit, must be a diagnosis consistent with non-traumatic, non-radicular, 
musculoskeletal LBP.
-Patient is to be discharged home. 
- Age 18-69 Enrollment will be limited to adults younger than 70 years because of the increased risk of 
adverse medication effects in the elderly.
-Non-radicular pain. Patients will be excluded if the pain radiates below the gluteal folds in a radicular 
pattern. 
-Pain duration <2 weeks (336 hours). Patients with more than two weeks of pain are at increased risk of 
poor pain and functional outcomes.(10)
-Prior to the acute attack of LBP, back pain must occur less frequently than once per month. Patients 
with more frequent back pain are at increased risk of poor pain and functional outcomes.(10) 
-Non-traumatic LBP: no substantial and direct trauma to the back within the previous month
-Functionally impairing back pain: A baseline score of > 5 on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire 
(Appendix)
Exclusion criteria:
-Not available for follow-up
-Pregnant 
-Any analgesic medication use on a daily or near-daily basis
-Allergic to or intolerant of investigational medications
-Open wounds or skin breakdown of the lower back
-Contra-indications to investigational medications: 1) known peptic ulcer disease, chronic dyspepsia, or 
history of gastrointestinal bleed 2) Severe heart failure (NYHA 2 or worse) 3) Chronic kidney disease 
(GFR <60ml/min) 4) Current use of anti-coagulants 5) cirrhosis (Child Pugh A or worse) or hepatitis 
(transaminases 2x the upper limit of normal)

Acute low back pain. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_6829]. 10212020Investigational medication
A. Ibuprofen 400mg orally + Diclofenac 1% gel, 4g topi[INVESTIGATOR_897], every 6 hours as needed 
B. Ibuprofen 400mg orally + placebo gel topi[INVESTIGATOR_897], every 6 hours as needed 
C. Diclofenac 1% gel, 4g topi[INVESTIGATOR_897] + placebo capsules, orally, every 6 hours as needed
Participants will be instructed to take one capsule of the investigational medication and apply the 
investigational gel together every 6 hours as needed for the pain. All study patients will be given a two-
day supply of investigational medication.
Outcome measures.
1. Roland Morris LBP Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)--Reproduced in the Appendix. This 24-item LBP 
functional scale is recommended for use in LBP research. (11) Its yes/ no format is amenable to 
telephone follow-up. We have used it successfully to obtain post-ED follow-up in five previous LBP 
studies involving more than 1500 patients.
2. Ordinal pain scale (“severe”, “moderate”, “mild”, or “none”). Study participants will be asked to 
describe their worst back pain in the previous 24 hours.
3. Medication requirements: “What medications did you use to treat your low back pain in the previous 
24 hours?” 
4. Low back pain frequency: “Over the last 24 hours, how often were you in pain?  Not at all, Rarely, 
Sometimes, Usually, Always”.  Low back pain symptomatology is quite variable. Some patients may 
experience no pain unless they move a certain way. Others may experience a constant low level of pain. 
This question will help determine the burdensomeness of the LBP in the patient’s daily life.
5. Satisfaction, as measured by [CONTACT_6857]: The next time you go to the ER with low back 
pain, do you want to get the same combination of medications?
Primary outcome
The change in Roland Morris Disability scale between the baseline ED visit and the two-day follow-up 
(Roland-Morris baseline - Roland-Morris day 2). The baseline questions will refer to the time period 
immediately prior to ED presentation (Before you came to the ER today, were you able to…..).
Secondary outcomes
   The following outcomes will be assessed 2 days and 7 days after ED discharge:
1. Worst LBP over the previous 24 hours, using a four-point ordinal scale: severe, moderate, mild, 
or none
2. Frequency of low back pain using the five-point Likert scale: Not at all, Rarely, Sometimes, 
Usually, Always
3. Use of any analgesic or LBP medication within the previous 24 hours.
4. Absolute RMDQ score
5. Able to return to all usual activities
6. Number of visits to any healthcare provider.
7. Satisfaction with treatment 
8. Frequency of adverse events including 
-GI side effects (dyspepsia, nausea, and bleeding)
-application site skin reactions such as dermatitis
-All other side effects

http://randomization.com The investigational oral medication will be masked by [CONTACT_6858], which will be packed with scant amounts of lactose and sealed. The investigational 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_6846]. This masking will take place 
in a secure location inaccessible to ED personnel. All clinical staff and patients will be blinded. Patients 
will be presented with one vial and one tube of investigational medication labeled with dosing 
instructions.  
Details of protocol
Prior to discharge from the ED and after the patient’s pain has been controlled, the healthcare provider 
will refer appropriate patients to study personnel for screening. Research associates will ascertain 
baseline socio-demographic information, low back pain history, and baseline variables discussed above. 
Research personnel will provide each patient with a 10-minute educational intervention. This will be 
based on NIAMS’s Handout on Health: Back Pain information webpage (available at 
http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Back_Pain/default.asp) Research personnel will review each 
section of the information sheet with the patient and elicit questions. Patients will be discharged with 
one medication vial containing a two-day supply of ibuprofen or placebo and one tube containing a two-
day supply of diclofenac gel or placebo gel. Additionally, the patients will be provided with a measuring 
tape and instructed to measure a 4.5-inch length of gel corresponding to a dose of [ADDRESS_5824] of LBP treatment. (11) The mean improvement in 
RMDQ among those who receive an NSAID alone was 10.2. The standard deviation was 8.9. A widely 
accepted minimum clinically important improvement of [ADDRESS_5825]-to-follow-up (typi[INVESTIGATOR_6847]-to-follow-up rate is 5-10%) 
and to ensure sufficient power for the per protocol analysis (in our previous ED-based LBP studies, up to 
1/[ADDRESS_5826] not used the medication more than once), we intend to enroll 66 patients 
in each arm (total n= 198).
Analysis
An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed among all patients for whom primary outcome data is 
available. The primary outcome will be a comparison of the change in RMDQ between baseline and day 
2. The mean difference between groups will be reported with 95%CI. For the superiority analyses, if the 
95%CI does not cross zero, the result will be considered statistically significant. For the equivalence 
analysis, if the 95%CI does not cross 5 or -5, the result will be considered statistically significant. For 
patients with missing 2 day follow-up data, we will perform two sensitivity analyses in which we assume 
universally good outcomes among all patients with missing data in one arm and universally bad arms

outcomes will be reported as rates with 95%CI. The between group difference will be reported with 
95%CI. A per protocol efficacy analysis will be conducted among those patients who use the 
investigational medication at least once.
Data Safety Monitoring Committee
This committee will be comprised of [CONTACT_6859], PhD, an epi[INVESTIGATOR_6848]. David Esses, MD, the 
director of the Moses ED. The committee will meet every month with the PI [CONTACT_1639] 1) monitor adverse 
events and develop strategies to minimize these; and, 2) monitor recruitment and enrollment. There will 
not be an interim analysis.
Consent
Study personnel will obtain informed consent once the patient’s pain has been controlled and the 
patient is ready for discharge from the ED. The attending physician will assess the patient’s capacity to 
consent to participate in this study. 
Risks/Benefits
NSAIDs are commonly used in more than 2.[ADDRESS_5827] 
part, these are minor events. Non-steroidals can cause life-threating gastro-intestinal bleeding, but this 
is unlikely in patients screened for gastro-intestinal illness who will take the medication for two days 
only. Non-steroidals increase cardiovascular and risk of renal injury and may worsen blood pressure 
control. When used topi[INVESTIGATOR_897], non-steroidals may cause application site reactions, including dermatitis.
Data Storage & Confidentiality
Data will be stored and maintained in REDCap. Data analysis will occur on password-protected 
computers. Consent documents will be maintained in locked research cabinets. Only study personnel 
will have access to the data and consent documents.
Unblinding
Subject treatment assignments will remain blinded until the final subject has completed follow up and 
all data has been recorded and validated.  Urgent, immediate unblinding due to medical emergency may 
be authorized by [CONTACT_737].

Background  
Cardiogenic shock complicates 2 -8% of all myocardial infarct ions in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115247], t he mortality rate in these patients 
can be as high as 50% during the  index  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .1 Cardiogenic shock from alternative 
causes such as advanced heart failure, acute myopericarditis, stress -induced cardiomyopathy, and 
acute valvular regurgitation ar e also associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 
Hypothermia , as defined by 32 -34° Celsius , has been proposed as a potential adjunctive therapy 
in patients with cardiogenic shock. The role of mild hypothermia has been well established in out 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115248] .[ADDRESS_128737], the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend 
therapeutic hypothermia  (Class I recommendation)  with targeted tempera ture of 32°C to 34°C 
for [ADDRESS_128738]  due to ventricular 
fibrillation  (VF) .[ADDRESS_128739].  
 
The proposed mechanism of improved neurological outcomes with therapeutic hypothermia 
(TH) likely involves changes in cerebral metabolism.4-[ADDRESS_128740] showed improved cardiac performance with TH with improved 
contractility, cardiac output, and reduction in the inflammatory  response  that accompanies shock .  
A small trial published in 2012 by [CONTACT_115264] -Schweda et. al prospectively enrolled 14 patients that 
were cooled to 33 °C and studied the ir hemodyn amics. I nterestingly, patients experienced  a 
statistically s ignificant drop in heart rate, but with increased stroke volume, higher mean arterial 
blood pressure (MAP) , and higher cardiac Power index  (CPI) .[ADDRESS_128741] importantly, the Schmidt -
Schweda trial established that hypothermia is safe in patients with cardiogenic shock  with no 
severe adverse events experienced in their cohort. There were no complications associated with  
insertion or removal of cooling catheters and anti -shivering measures were effective even in non -
ventilated patients (5 out of 14 patients were breathing  spontaneously during therapeutic 
hypothermia (TH) ). While there was a decline in platelets  with TH, t his did not lead to an 
increase in bleeding . Another  study from authors at the  Cleveland Clinic retrospectively 
evaluated the hemodynamic effects of TH on 14 consecutive patients with cardiogenic shock 
who underwent therapeutic hypothermia.9 The patients who underwent TH had higher cardiac 
index, lower SVR, and lower  vasopressor requirements .9 Importantly, TH was deemed safe , and 
given the positive effects on hemodynamic parameters, the authors propose d that prospective 
trials are needed to potentially expand the role of TH outside of cardiac arres t. 
 
Version:  26Mar2018   Page 3 of 23 Patients with cardiogenic shock, regardless of the underlying etiology, present with hypotension, 
shortness of breath, altered mental status, signs of volume overload (elevated jugular venous 
pressure, pulmonary rales, lower extremity edema) , and evidence of end -organ hypoperfusion. 
These patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_115249] (CCU) for aggressive treatment 
to reverse the course of the disease. Standard of care therapy for these patients involves initiation 
of ionotropes and/or vasopresso rs along with diuretics. Often, mechanical circulatory support (i.e 
Intra -arterial balloon pump or temporary left -ventricular assist devices)  and invasive 
hemodymamic monitoring (i.e. placement of a pulmonary artery catheter)  is necessary.  
 
The results of the small trials mentioned above are encouraging, but larger randomized trials are 
necessary to establish the role of TH in patients with cardiogenic shock.  We propose a first -ever 
randomized clinical trial to prospectively study the effect s of TH in pati ents with cardiogenic 
shock. In addition to assessing the safety of TH in this patient population, hemodynamic 
parameters, echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function during hypothermia, as well 
electrocardiographic changes with hypothermia will be st udied.  The echocardiographic changes  
during TH have never been previously reported. Studying TH in patients with cardiogenic shock 
is important, as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_115250]. Given the high mortality associated with cardiogenic shock despi[INVESTIGATOR_115251], the clinical implications of result s from this trial may be large.  
 
Objective  
The purpose of the study is to prospectively randomize  patients with cardioge nic shock  to 
standard therapy plus therapeutic hypothermia or standard medical therapy alone in order to 
assess the safety of TH in patients with cardiogenic shock. This study will also help understand  
the physiologic effect s of TH  in cardiogenic shock. This will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_115252] .

Procedures  
Patients admitted to the Coronary Care unit (CCU) at the University of Chicago will be screened 
by [CONTACT_115265] . Patients meeting the 
inclusion criteria , as defined previously, will be identified and randomiz ed after informed 
consent within [ADDRESS_128743] medical care  alone . A pulmonary artery (PA) catheter will be placed 
at the bedside or in the Cardiac Cath lab  if difficult anatomy is anticipated. As mentioned earlier, 
placement of a PA catheter is part of the standard of care for management of cardiogenic shock. 
Currently, patients who are admitted to the University of Chicago CCU with cardiogenic shock 
routinely un dergo placement of PA catheter by [CONTACT_115266]. Data from the PA catheter is vital in  initiating vasopressors/inotropes, assessin g 
the response to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and possible need for escalation of therapy (i. e. mechanical 
support).  In this study, patients in each arm will undergo PA catheter placement . 
 
Cooling will then be initiated  and maintained  using  FDA approved  ZOLL (Chelmsford, MA) 
Intravascular Temperature Management (IVTM™) system  with the ZOLL Quattro cooling 
catheter . The ZOLL  IVTM  along with the Quattro cooling catheter are currently FDA approved 
for use in cardiac surgery patients to achieve and maintain normothermia during surgery and in 
recovery and to induce, maintain, and reverse mild hypothermia in neurosurgery p atients during  
surgery and in recovery [11]. The IVTM is not currently FDA approved to achieve therapeutic 
hypothermia in cardiogenic shock. The use of the cooling catheter and the temperature 
management system wil l be off -label for this study.   Notably, although not FDA approved for 
this purpose, current AHA practice guidelines recommend therapeutic hypothermia with a goal 
temperature of 32°C to 34°C for [ADDRESS_128744] is from VT/VF and as Class IIb recommendation 
for CA from other nonshockable rhythms. The European Resuscitation Council guidelines for 
resuscitation recommend therapeutic hypothermia for all comatose survivors of CA regardless of 
initial rhythm  
 
The ZOLL 9.3 French Quattro® catheter  is inserted into the central venous system via the 
femoral approach  by [CONTACT_115267].  Placement of the 
ZOLL  catheter is identical  to central venous line insertion, such as triple lumen insertion for 
Version:  26Mar2018   Page [ADDRESS_128745] XP® thermal regulati on 
system. The Quattro®  catheter functions as both a central venous triple lumen catheter as well as 
a cooling catheter.  Cooling is achieved by [CONTACT_115268] a closed system  through 
the catheter . The flow and temperature (range 4° C to 42°C) of the circulating saline  serves as the 
heat exchange mechanism and is controlled by [CONTACT_115269]® thermal regulation 
system . The temperature is m easured and adjustments are made by [CONTACT_115270].  The target temperature is achieved within 2 -3 
hours  of initiation of TH . Rewarming is accomplished using the same balloon catheter system  
and heat exchange occurs without infusi on of any saline or fluids into the patient.  In clini cal 
trials, intravenous catheter based cooling system has been shown to achieve target temperature 
faster and  maintain target temperature with more precision.12,14,15 
 
Medical therapy in both intervention and non -intervention groups will be based on the current 
recommendations for management of cardiogenic shock. This includes inotropic therapy ( i.e. 
dobutamine or milrinone) for cardiac support, vasopressor therapy ( i.e. norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
dopamine, phenylephrine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) to achieve target blood pressure (mean arterial blood 
pressure ≥ 60 mmHg), diuretics for volume removal, and mechanical circulatory support as 
clinically indicated. All patients included in this study will have pulmonary artery (PA) catheters 
inserted within 12 hours of randomization  via either the internal jugular or femoral venous 
approach to monitor real -time hemodynamics. The clinicians in the CCU will use the data from 
PA catheters (cardiac output,  mixed venous saturation, systemic vascular resistance, etc.) to 
guide therapy for both the intervention and non -intervention groups. The primary investigator of 
this study ([CONTACT_115280]) will have no role in the clinical management  of the patient s. 
 
Laboratory , echocardiographic, and hemodynamic parameters will be obtained for patients prior 
to randomization, near the end of [ADDRESS_128746]-
randomization. Core t emperature will be measured via either thermal tip at the end of a 
transure thral urinary catheter  or endotracheal temperature probe in intubated patients . 
Rewarming will be accomplished at 0.3°C per hour until temperature reaches 37°C.  
 
Target Enrollment and Study Duration  
In this initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], w e anticipate enrolling [ADDRESS_128747] or a Fisher’s exact test with a Bonferroni method continuity correction for 
multiple endpoints.  Furthermore, numerical secondary endpoints will be presented as either 
Version:  26Mar2018   Page 9 of 23 mean ±  standard deviation or median (interquartile range) based upon the distribution of the data.  
In addition, all numerical secondary endpoints will be assessed using two independent t tests or 
Mann -Whitney U test for comparisons.  Categorical variables will be tested with chi -square tests 
of association or Fisher’s exact tests.  Differences will be considered significant using an alpha 
value of 0.[ADDRESS_128748].  Analyses will be performed using STATA MP Version 14 
(College Station, TX).  
 
Potential risks and benefits to subjects  
A. Benefits : 
There is mounting evidence that TH has positive effects on cardiac function. Multiple studies 
have suggested that TH may offer particular benefit in cardiogenic shock. In this prospective 
trial, the pat ients will be randomized to TH or standard medical care using simple randomization. 
With TH, we expect increased cardiac output, inc reased contractility, lower  SVR, and higher 
cardiac power index which will lead to improved hemodynamics and potentially dec reasing 
pressor requirements.  
 
B. Risks:  
Anticipated adverse events that could possibly occur during the study include, but are not limited 
to: 
1. Risks associated with TH  
a. Shivering  
b. Arrhythmia  
c. Coagulopathy with or without clinically significant bleeding  
d. Hype rglycemia  
e. Hypothermia  
f. Electrolyte abnormalities  
g. Infections  
2. Risks associated wit h cooling catheter  insertion  
a. Bleeding  
b. Infection  
c. Vascular injury  
 
Mitigating Risks associated with TH : 
Shivering is the most common risk associated with TH. Shivering is a normal physiological 
response to cooling  as it allow s the body to expend energy and generate heat. This leads to 
increasing metabolic demands and subsequent oxygen consumption . Various strategies can be 
used to combat shivering  and have these have been well described in the literature . In patients 
that are intubated, the most common means of combating shivering is a combination of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], and/or neuromuscular blockade.16 In awake patients , 
combination of meperedine and warming of skin with air-warming products such a ‘Bair Hugger 
Version:  26Mar2018   Page 10 of 23 blanket’ (3M, St. Paul, MN) hugger’ are utilized .[ADDRESS_128749] demonstr ated significant lowerin g of the shivering 
threshold  with meperidine .17,18 Given that intravascular cooling therapy is common in multiple 
ICU settings, including the cardiac care unit (CCU), protocols are already in place for the 
management of shivering , with an institutional -approved  anti-shivering protocol often used in 
patients undergoing TH.18 In the event of persistent shivering despi[INVESTIGATOR_115256] s, anesthetics (i.e. propofol or meperidine) and/or paralytic agents in intubated patients, 
the TH protocol will be stopped and patients will be rewarmed to normothermia . 
 
Therapeutic hypothermia may potentially increase the risk of arrhythmias and will be evaluated 
in this trial . Bradycardia is expected with  TH. In the previo usly published studies, the reduction 
in heart rate is not significant enough to cause hemodynamic compromise .9,17,[ADDRESS_128750] underlying conduction 
system disease (i.e. first or second degree AV block) prior to cooling, In such cases, patient s will 
be rewarmed to normothermia per the rewarming protocol currently in place for intravascular 
cooling of critically ill patients.  
 
In addition to bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias are potential adverse effects of TH. While 
ventricular arrhythmias have  veen reported with TH, data from trials suggests that there is no 
demonstrable increase in risk of ventricular arrhythmias in patients undergoing therapeutic 
hypoethermia.24,[ADDRESS_128751] been exhausted, the patient will be 
rewarmed to normothermia per the rewarming protocol.  
 
Another risk associated with TH is mild coagulopathy. Temperatures below 33 C have been 
associated with mild platelet dysf unction in vitro. However, the risk of bleeding with mild TH 
(32-34C) is minimal and none of the trials of TH in cardiac arrest or stroke have demonstrated 
increased risk of bleeding .20,[ADDRESS_128752] result o f TH, initial conservative 
measures of simple transfusions  will be implemented. However, if bleeding does not respond to 
these conservative measures or progresses to severe bleeding, the TH protocol will be stopped 
and patients will be safely rewarmed . 
 
Version:  26Mar2018   Page [ADDRESS_128753] 
concominant diabetes  and glucose control can often be difficult to achieve in these critically ill 
patients. Clinically significant h yperglycemia will be defined as glucose level exceeding 
200mg/d  requiring continuous insulin infusion  in patients without a diagnosis of diabetes 
mellitus . Hyperglycemia in  patient s with  diagnosis of diabetes  mellitus , or hyperglycemia as a 
result of other identifiable causes (i.e. administration of steroids, adrenal derangements) will not 
be considered as a result of TH. In patients who develop hyperglycemia requiring continuous 
insuling infusion as a direct result of TH, the patient will be treated expectantly and 
hyperglycemia will be recorded as an adverse event. During TH period, b lood glucose will be 
measured at least hourly during TH, especially in patients receiving intravenous insu lin, and 
during rewarming, when glucose levels can fall.  
 
Hypothermia will lower serum potassium levels, primarily by [CONTACT_115271], although hypothermia also induces a mild diuresis with concurrent electrolyte 
wasting. Serum ele ctrolytes will be measured at regular intervals (every 4 –6 hours). Potassium 
will be repleted to maintain levels above 3.5 mEq/L. Rewarming reverses the potassium flux and 
increases serum levels, so repletion will be held 4 hours before rewarming begins. C linically 
significant hyperkalemia is unusual in patients with preserved renal function.  In patients with 
hypokalemia not due to other identifiable causes (diuretic administration, adrenal derangements, 
etc.), potassium supplements will be administered as per standard of care.   Hypokalemia with 
potassium levels below 3.0mEq/L not secondary to other identifiable causes in patients 
undergoing TH will be considered an adverse event.  
 
The target temperature of 32 -34C will be achieved using the intravascular co oling catheters. 
The body temperature will be recorded  every 1 -2 hours as per the CCU policy in the TH group 
(as well as the control group). The time spent in the therapeutic window will be recorded and 
reported. Any deviations outside of the range, specif ically <32 C lasting > 5 minut es will be 
reported as an adverse event.  
 
Mitigating Risks associated with cooling catheter insertion : 
The risks associated with i nsertion of a cooling catheter are  the same as insertion of any  central 
lumen catheter. These include, but are not limited to, bleeding, infection, and vascular injury. 
Previously published studies have quoted risk of localized hematomas at 4.7% and risk of 
vascular injury (most frequently due to inadvertent arterial puncture) at <1%.[ADDRESS_128754] of care in patients in cardiogenic shock t o allow 
for administration of i notropes/vasopressors. The ZOLL  Quattro catheters include three standard 
Version:  26Mar2018   Page [ADDRESS_128755] central venous line.  
 
C. Monitoring of Safety : 
During the intervention period , participants will be monitored by [CONTACT_13922], nurses, and 
technicians in accordance with standard  medical care.  This includes 24 -hour monitored 
telemetry, with measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_862].  Real-time hemodynamic monitoring will be measure d using pulmonary artery catheter s. 
Blood glucose and electrolyte measurements will be performed as per protocol for patients 
undergoing therapeutic hypothermia, and correction of abnormalities will be performed by t he 
treating team.  Shivering will be monitored by [CONTACT_115272], per ICU protocol, and will be 
reported to the treating team.  TH will not influence the clinician’s medical decisions  – any 
medical or mechanical intervention necessary based on c linical  status will be allowed.  
 
D. Data Safety Monitoring Board:  
Adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_115273].  The 
study will be halted upon the discovery of unanticipated adverse device events that present a 
significan t or unreasonable risk to subjects enrolled in the study.  
 
The DSMB will meet (in person or via telephone conference) a minimum of 3 times:  
• after treatment of the first 4 subjects  (2 in the TH arm and 2 in the control arm)  
• after treatment  of the first  10 subjects (5 in the TH arm and 5 in the control arm)  
• at the conclusion of the study  
 
In addition, the DSMB may convene additional meetings if necessary to ensure the ongoing 
monitoring and safety of the subjects treated with therapeutic hyp othermia (TH).  A copy of the 
DSMB charter is located in Appendix 2.  
 
We will collect all treatment emergent and serious unsolicited adverse events during the index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  A treatment emergent adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of therapeutic hypothermia, whether or not considered related.  The 
DSMB will be informed of expected adverse events , such as shivering, bleeding, and 
bradycardia , that result in termination of the protocol . Additionally, any unexpecte d adverse 
events while undergoing TH will be reported to the DSMB, whether deemed related to TH or 
not.  All adverse event details will be provided to the DSMB prior to the meeting with ample 
time allowed for analysis.  This will include details of the ind ividual adverse events as well as 
the PI’s analysis related to causality, severity and frequency.   The DSMB will be responsible for 
Version:  26Mar2018   Page 13 of 23 confirmation of the PI’s assessment of all adverse events  and final adjudication of all adverse 
events . 
 
The DSMB will inclu de the following individuals who have agreed to serve on it:  
[CONTACT_115281] (University of Chicago Medicine – Section of Cardiology)  
[CONTACT_115282] -Maitland  (Inova Health System – Section of Cardiology)

Payment to Subjects  
Participants will not receive monetary compensation  for thei r participation in this study.  The 
cost of the TH catheters , thermal regulation system and associated monitoring will be part of the 
study c osts and patients will not  be charged for these services.  
 
Informed Consent  
Informed consent for the study will be obtained from the  patient if possible, or the medical 
decision maker  in the event that the patient is incapable of making informed decisions . Due to 
the nature of the study, we expect that the patient’s clinical status will preclude consent directly 
from the patient. We anticipate that a majority of the consents will be obtained from family and 
medical decision makers. Once the referring physic ian has given approval and solicited a 
patient’s  or decision maker’s interest, a co -investigator will approach and discuss the possibility 
of participating in this research  protocol . The co -investigator will discuss the background and 
significance of the study, the inclusion and exclusion requirements, and why they are suitable for 
participation. The study will be summarized for the subject. They will also be informed that they 
may w ithdraw at any time during the study without influencing their medical care. The potential 
participant, including decision maker, will be given the opportunity to ask questions.  
 
Confidentiality  
A study file containing all study related infor mation w ill be  kept by [CONTACT_115274] a 
file cabinet within a locked office or on an encrypted electronic file.  Each subject enrolled will 
have their own file including: study ID number, physician’s consent, clinical data as described in 
Methods, the origi nal signed consent form, proof of eligibility, and any other forms or 
information.  
 
Protection of S pecial Populations  
Patients younger than 18  years or older than 89 years will be excluded . Additional exclusions 
will be made as described in Methods. No gr oup of patients will bear disproportionate risk or 
burden.   This includes all eligible Medicare  and Medicaid  beneficiaries and will not discriminate 
any patient  on the basis of gender, age, disability, and racial or ethnic background.  As such, we 
believe that the results obtained from this study will be generalizable to the Medicare  and 
Medicaid  beneficiary population within our specifically stated inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Underlying diseases are not reported as AEs unless there is an increase in severity or frequency 
during t he course of the investigation.  
 
Relationship to Study Device(s) and Reporting Requirements  
The In vestigator will assess the relationship of the AE to the study device as related or unrelated.  
 
Version:  26Mar2018   Page 21 of 23 Table B – Criteria for Assessing Relationship of Study Device to Adverse Event  
Classification  Description  
Unrelated  The adverse event is determined to be due to a concurrent illness or effect 
of another device/drug and is not related to the investigational product.  
Related  • The adverse event is determined to be potentially related to the 
investigational product, and an alternative etiology is equally or less 
likely compared to the potential relationship to investigational product, 
or 
• There is a strong relationship to investigational product, or recurs on re -
challenge, and another etiology is unlikely, or  
• There is no other reasonable medical explanation fo r the event.

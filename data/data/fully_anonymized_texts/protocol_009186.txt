A. RESEARCH PLAN  
A.1 Overview : Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of 
disability among Veterans 1. Nonsteroid al anti -inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) are the most commonly prescribed medications for this 
disorder 2 with over 50% of people with OA reporting regular use 3. 
While short -term studies have demonstrated that NSAIDs are more 
effective than placebo and acetaminophen, there are no long-term 
data supporting the use of these medications 2,4. Maximum benefits 
are reported within 1 month and the single published long -term 
study showed no significant difference in knee pain at 1 year 
between NSAIDs and placebo 5. Moreover, the decrease in pain 
conferred by [CONTACT_564104] -defined thresholds 
indicating clinically significant improvement (Figure 1)  6. Given these 
data and the substantial morbidity associated with long -term NSAID 
use, discontinuation trials to determine whether there is a clinically 
significant increment al benefit of NSAIDs over and above placebo 
are warranted.  
The objectives of this proposal are to determine whether 1) placebo 
is as effective as continued NSAIDs, and 2) cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) is a viable alternative to continued NSAID use. While 
acetaminophen is also a viable alternative, the vast majority of patients with knee OA have failed this 
medication before initiating NSAIDs. The same argument applies to topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450]. CBT is safe and 
appropriate for patients with varying level s of pain. We chose CBT over a self -management program given the 
ability of CBT to address comorbidities that are commonly associated with OA and frequent among Veterans 
(e.g. depression and insomnia  7,8) and the Pain Research In formatics Medical Comorbidity and Education 
(PRIME) Center’s extensive experience and expertise in delivering CBT.  
To address our objectives, we propo se a 2 -phase randomized withdrawal trial (RWT)  (see Figure 2 , section D):  
Phase 1: Veterans with knee OA w ill be randomized to continue NSAIDs or to placebo for 4 weeks. This 
double -blind phase will enable us to infer whether placebo is non -inferior to continued NSAID use.  
Phase 2: At week 4, subjects in the NSAIDs group will continue NSAIDs. Those on placebo  will stop taking the  
placebo and participate in a 10 -week CBT program. The second phase will allow us to infer whether CBT is 
non-inferior to NSAIDs. This adjunctive, non -pharmacologic treatment was chosen because it 1) has already 
been found to be effect ive in OA 9-11, 2) can be safely administered to all potential subjects, and 3) can be 
tailored to benefit patients based on their individual needs. Placebo will not  be continued during Phase [ADDRESS_740990] adapted to their current heath state and is not 
suitable for subjects with levels of pain warranting esca lation of analgesics (Please see Exclusion criteria in 
D.2). We acknowledge that patients and physicians may be reluctant to stop a medication which they perceive 
as being effective. In order to maximize enrollment, we will recruit subjects for whom a tria l of NSAID AEs: Adverse Events  ITT: Intent -to-Treat  PRIME: Pain Research Informatics

To the best of our knowledge this will be the first tria l to examine the effects of withdrawing NSAIDs. The study 
design is innovative in that it will definitively answer whether physicians should attempt to withdraw NSAIDs in 
patients who are comparable to those meeting the eligibility criteria described in th is proposal. If positive, the 
data generated from the study may empower both physicians and patients to try safer treatment alternatives 
for knee OA. This project will address the VA’s commitment to improve care for Veterans with chronic pain as 
well as th ose with limited access to VA onsite services. The trial will be supported by [CONTACT_564105] (VACHS)  PRIME  Center. The proposed team of investigators includes experienced health 
services researchers, with expertise in OA, pain, CBT, a nd cost -effectiveness studies (see section C).  
B. BACKGROUND  
B.[ADDRESS_740992] of Knee OA: Knee OA is the most common cause of knee pain and lower extremity disability in 
older adults  12. Veterans have an even higher prevalence of OA compar ed to non -Veterans [ADDRESS_740993] of OA in Veterans is not limited to older adults. Rates are 26% 
higher in service members age 20 to 24 than in the general population and troops over the age of 40 are more 
than twice as likel y to develop OA as civilians 16. Injuries are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of OA in 
younger Vet erans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Research studies focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_564048].  
B.2 Management of Knee OA: OA is characterized by [CONTACT_564106]. At present, there is no 
cure for the disease nor has any intervention been shown to alter its progression. Medical treatment of OA 
(which includes both pharmacologic and non -pharmacologic options) is a imed at management of symptoms 
(pain, swelling and stiffness) and maintenance or improvement of lower extremity function. In general, the 
effect sizes related to these options are modest 2. In contrast, total knee arthroplasty is a highly effective 
treatment option for patients with knee OA  17. Yet, not all patients want, or are eligible for surgery.  
B.3 Efficacy and Toxicity of NSAIDs: Short -term trials have demonstrated that NSAIDs are more effective at 
decreasing knee pain in OA compared to both placebo and acetaminophen 18. However, the effect sizes are 
small and there are no data to support the use of NSAIDs beyond 3 months 19. A meta -analysis focusing on the 
efficacy of NSAIDs for knee  OA found that subjects improved by 15.6% (as measured by [CONTACT_564107] a visual analogue scale) after [ADDRESS_740994] size, in a random effects 
model, was 0.3 (0.2 -0.4) 4. Maximum NSAID related benefits occur within [ADDRESS_740995] commonly prescribed medications for OA. 
More than 100 million prescriptions are written for NSAIDs in  the US each year. This dramatic figure does not 
account for the number of OTC NSAIDs used. The widespread use of NSAIDs for OA warrants careful scrutiny 
because of the known significant toxicity associated with this class of medications. NSAIDs increase t he risk of 
gastrointestinal ulcer disease and hemorrhage, acute renal failure, serious cardiovascular events (including 
stroke and myocardial infarction) and worsening of preexisting heart failure 20,21. Complications related to  long-
term NSAID use result in approximately 103,[ADDRESS_740996] to suffer a NSAID -
related stroke to result in 1 additional death within 30 days. Forty -three percent of Veterans are considered to 
be at high risk of NSAID -related complications, and yet adherence to evidence -based guidelines for safer 
prescription of NSAIDs is low (27%) in the VA 23.

 B.4 CBT and Pain: CBT is the most commonly cited psychological alternative to more traditional medical and 
rehabilitation approaches to chronic pain management, and has demonstrated efficacy for reducing pain and 
improving function in persons with a broad spectrum of condit ions 24. CBT is informed by a theory of chronic 
pain that hypothesizes that patients' idiosyncratic beliefs, attitudes and copi[INVESTIGATOR_564049] a central role in 
determining their experiences of pain 25. The overarching goal of CBT is to assist the patient in the 
development of an adaptive problem -solving, sel f-directed approach to pain management based on a 
conceptualization of pain as controllable and a personal attitude of self -efficacy and self -control. CBT is a 
structured and goal -oriented therapeutic approach that can be delivered in either small group or  individual 
sessions. During therapy, a range of cognitive pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (e.g., challenging unhealthy thoughts , 
development of positive copi[INVESTIGATOR_52497] -statements) and behavioral strategies (e.g., activity pacing, mental 
relaxation and other stress reduct ion) are taught. Progress toward overall treatment goals and pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_564050]. Naylor et al 26 
recently published the results of a trial designed to examine the effects of CBT on NSAID and opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444]. In 
this trial, after 11 weeks of group CBT, 51 subjects with chronic musculoskeletal pain were randomized to a 
therapeutic interactive voice response program and 25 subjec ts were randomized to receive usual care. 
Between -groups analysis demonstrated significant reductions in opi[INVESTIGATOR_192842] 8 months among subjects 
randomized to the experimental arm. NSAID use was lower after 4, but not after 8 months of follow -up. 
B.5 CBT and Knee OA:  Experimental studies have demonstrated that CBT is an effective treatment for 
patients with OA. Keefe et al [ADDRESS_740997] lower levels of psychological and ph ysical disability 
than those who had received education and usual care.  
Calfas et al 27 conducted a trial to compare CBT and education in OA. CBT was delivered in 10 weekly group 
sessions and education included 10 weekly didactic lectures given by [CONTACT_201329]. After one year, 
subjects in both groups demonstrated significant improvem ents in depressive symptoms, quality of well -being 
and pain; however, there were no between -group differences. In a recent trial examining the closely associated 
variables of sleep disturbance and pain, CBT improved sleep and decreased pain in subjects wit h OA, 
whereas subjects randomized to an attention control reported no improvements in either condition 7. In 
addition, a meta -analysis found that CBT has significant beneficial effects on pain, anxiety, depression and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_564051]  28. This review concluded that there was strong evidence to support an 
incremental benefit of CBT over and above standard medical care.  
There are also some indirect data to suggest that the proposed strategy may be cost effective for the VA. 
Cronan et al [ADDRESS_740998] in knee OA by  [CONTACT_564108]. The proposed trial may result in decreased utilization of 
services related to treatment for OA; however , we expect that cost savings will result primarily f rom decreased 
NSAID -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285].  
B.6 Appeal of Telephone -Based Strategies: Telephone -based interventions have the potential to greatly 
expand delivery of care at an affordable cost to Veterans with limited access to outpatient clinics (due to 
geographic, financial, or health -related barriers). This is especially true for older ad ults with OA living in regions 
with poor public transportation. Telephone -based behavioral interventions can frequently be delivered at lower 
cost than face -to-face interventions, and are less impeded by [CONTACT_564109].  
4 
 B.6.a Telephone -Based Programs for OA : Previous controlled studies have demonstrated that telephone -
based programs can improve functional status in patients with OA. Rene et al 31 found that a telephone -
administered educational intervent ion improved patients’ functional status. In a separate study, Maisiuk et al [ADDRESS_740999], however, opted for more frequent and longer (~30 -45 minute) sessions in order to 
effec tively deliver a comprehensive CBT program.  
B.6.b Telephone -Administered CBT : Several experimental studies have demonstrated that CBT can be 
successfully administered over the telephone. Lovell et al [ADDRESS_741000] 
as effective as face -to-face CBT in treating subjects with obsessive compulsive disorder. Taylor et al 35 also 
demonstrated the efficacy of telephone -administered CBT in subjects with this disorder. Mohr et al 36 found that 
telephone -administered CBT was more effective than telephone -delivered supportive emotion -focused therapy 
in treating depression amongs t patients with multiple sclerosis. DuHamel et al 37 demonstrated that telephone -
administered CBT was effective at treating posttraumatic stress disorder in cancer survivors.  
B.7 Randomized Withdrawal Trials: While the traditional RCT is the most commonly used design to assess 
treatment efficacy, the large number of Veterans with knee OA already using NSAIDs, the expected number of 
drop-outs in a long -term pain study, the safety concerns related to initiating l ong-term use of NSAIDs in an 
experimental setting, and the expected increased use of co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564052], warrant consideration of an 
alternative approach.  Amery and Dony first proposed the RWT design as a method to examine the long -term 
efficacy of non -curative treatment options in [ADDRESS_741001], the RWT randomizes 
subjects currently using the intervention to continued use or to placebo. This approach is particularly useful for 
examining the efficac y of symptomatic (i.e. non -curative) treatments when prolonged use of placebo and 
expected number of drop -outs is likely to threaten the internal validity of the trial. The RWT is also a practical 
method of obtaining evidence to support or refute the conti nued use of medications which are already widely 
prescribed despi[INVESTIGATOR_564053].  
A systematic review of RWTs evaluating analgesics 39 and a second paper utiliz ing computer simulation 
models 40 concluded that the RWT is an efficient design requiring sample sizes of 20% to 50% of those in 
classic RCTs. The required sample sizes are smaller becaus e of the greater homogeneity in the study 
population. Carryover and withdrawal syndromes, important limitations of this approach, are not relevant for 
the proposed study, as NSAIDs have relatively short half -lives and unlike opi[INVESTIGATOR_564054] (apart from recurrent pain) upon discontinuation.  
A Medline search on October 27, 2011 of the following Medline terms (text words: discontinuation trial or 
withdrawal trial and MESH terms: analgesics or pain or arthritis or NSAIDs) revealed [ADDRESS_741002] relevant to the RWT described in this application. In this study, Cibere et 
al 42 randomized 137 subjects currently using gluc osamine (a widely available neutraceutical used for arthritis) 
to continued use of glucosamine versus placebo. The authors chose to use a RWT design because of the 
prevalent use of glucosamine and the assumed, albeit unproven, long -term effectiveness of th e compound. 
After 6 months, the active neutraceutical was not found to be more effective than placebo. However, because 
the study was designed as a superiority trial, it cannot conclude that there is no difference between placebo 
and glucosamine . For this reason the proposed  trial is designed as a non -inferiority trial.  
B.8 Non-Inferiority Trials:  Because the clinical question of interest is to determine whether placebo + CBT is 
no worse  than continued NSAID use, a superiority trial is not well -suited to this proposal. A supe riority trial 
5 
 would not  allow us to determine whether Veterans who discontinue NSAIDs do not experience more pain 
compared to those who continue NSAIDs ─ even if well powered and negative 48. While superiority trials, which 
fail to reject the null hypothesis,  are frequently interpreted as negative (i.e., no difference between the 2 
groups), they should be interpreted as indeterminate (uncertain) 48. A non -inferiority trial is appropriate in this 
context because the new strategy under investigation is safer than t he current widespread long -term use of 
NSAIDs for knee OA 49. We acknowledge, however, that there are important issues to be con sidered in 
designing a non -inferiority trial, including:  
1. Assay sensitivity: We will take several precautions to reduce the factors that can limit assay sensitivity (i.e., 
the ability of a trial to demonstrate a real difference between the 2 arms if one tr uly exists). We will include 
a run -in period to ensure that subjects respond to and are able to tolerate the study drug. We will include 
measures to enhance CBT treatment fidelity (see D.16). We will measure the primary outcome and 
adherence weekly, employ  a well -validated primary outcome measure, and use both an intent -to-treat (ITT) 
and a “completers” or per protocol analysis (PP) as justified below. These design features are 
recommended to minimize biases towards the null 49. 
2. Choice of the non -inferiority margin: The margin of non -inferiority will be pre -stated and informed by [CONTACT_564110] 49. 
3. Analyses: Because the ITT approach analyzes all subjects according to their initial group assignment, 
including those who do not complete the protocol, it tends to bias toward making the results look similar 
across groups. Consequently, we will perform both ITT and PP analyses. Experts recommend that 
objectives in non -inferiority trials be met by [CONTACT_564111] 49.  
B.9 Study Drug:  Though it would be ideal for subjects randomized to the active study drug to continue their 
current NSAID, having the VA pharma cy formulate multiple different active drugs and maintaining the blind 
would be unwieldy and cost prohibitive. Given that studies have failed to demonstrate any significant 
differences amongst NSAIDs in treating subjects with OA [ADDRESS_741003] their NSAID with the stud y drug (see D. 6). 
The duration of the run -in period was chosen based on data demonstrating that patients with OA respond to 
meloxicam by [ADDRESS_741004] commonly prescribed NSAID is meloxicam 15mg orally once daily. Of the 8,514 orders for 
NSAIDs written between October 2009 and October 2010, 1,975 were for meloxicam 15mg (only 6 were for 
meloxicam 7.5mg) a nd most of the remaining prescriptions were for varying doses of naproxen and ibuprofen. 
Reliable data on the most commonly used OTC NSAIDs are not available. RCT data demonstrate that the 
efficacy of meloxicam is comparable to other NSAIDs in subjects wit h knee OA 52. A trial conducted by [CONTACT_564112] [ADDRESS_741005] improved gastrointestinal 
tolerabili ty compared to other NSAIDs. In a systematic review of clinical trials, serious gastrointestinal events 
(defined as perforation, ulceration or bleeding) was 0.2% in subjects receiving meloxicam, 1.2% in subjects 
receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_18234], 0.6% in subjects receiv ing diclofenac, and 2.1% in subjects receiving naproxen 52. 
B.[ADDRESS_741006] to Veterans:  Knee OA is now recognized as a major health problem. It is t he 
number one cause of lower extremity disability and has significant deleterious effects on quality of life 1. While 
there are numerous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564055], most have limited efficacy 2. Of particular concern is the 
widespread use of NSAIDs and their associated increased rates of mor bidity and mortality. Veterans, as a 
group, are at particularly high risk for both gastrointestinal and cardiovascular NSAID -induced complications . 
The proposed study is especially appealing because: 1) it may decrease drug -related morbidity and mortality;  
2) we now recognize that access to VA health services is a significant barrier for at least one third of the 3 
million Veterans living in rural areas; 3) Veterans with knee OA are often among those likely to have difficulty 
with transportation because the y are older and suffer from pain and subsequent limited mobility; 4) telephone -
[ADDRESS_741007] been shown to benefit patients with knee OA; 5) if successful, implementation of 
this strategy will be greatly facilitated by [CONTACT_564113]; and 6) this 
program may result in significant cost savings for both Veterans (decreased co -pays and transportation costs) 
and the VA (decreased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564056] -induced toxicity). This work will also provi de the VA with 
data enabling prioritized, value -based health care, where treatment strategies offering greater clinical benefit at 
equal or reduced cost could be supported or expanded, while lower value strategies could be restricted or have 
increased cost -sharing, resulting in amplification of health benefits without increased health expenditures  53.

 D. METHODS  
Overview:  Participa nts will participate in a [ADDRESS_741011] their current 
NSAID with the study drug (meloxicam 15mg per day). Those who remain eligible at the end of the run -in 
period, will participate in a 4 -week, double -blind, placebo -controlled, non -inferiority RWT. After 4 weeks, 
subjects in the meloxicam arm will continue on the study drug. Subjects in the placebo arm will stop the  
placebo and participate in a 10 -week CBT program (Figure 2).  
 
          0             14-weeks      
Aim 1: To determine whether placebo is non-inferior to continued NSAID use : 680 subjects will be 
enrolled into a 2 -week run -in period where they will stop their current NSAID and start taking the study drug 
(meloxicam 15mg per day). Those who remain eligible after the run -in period will be randomized to continued 
meloxicam use versus  placebo for 4 weeks.  
Aim 2 : To determine whether CBT is non -inferior to continued NSAID use : After 4 weeks, subjects in the 
meloxicam arm will continue on the study drug. Those in the placebo arm will stop the placebo and participate 
in a 10-week CBT prog ram. 
D.1 Subjects: Participants will be drawn from Veterans with knee OA currently enrolled in the VACHS and the 
Providence VA Medical Center. Both centers serve  Veterans with similar demographics; approximately 85% 
Veterans are White, 14% are Black, 0.3% are Pacific Islanders, 0.2% are Native American, and 0.1% are 
Asian. Twelve percent describe themselves as being Hispanic. As of 2012, West Haven had 1987 women 
enrolled: 38% between the ages of 18 and 44, 37% between the ages of 45 -64, and 25% over the ag e of 65. 
The corresponding numbers of women at the Providence VA are: Total = 1098: 31% between the ages of 18 
and 44, 39% between the ages of 45 -64, and 29% over the age of 65. We will oversample women during the 
recruitment phase by [CONTACT_564114] 5 0% of the opt -out letters sent are to women. The same approach will 
be used to improve representation of minorities.  
D.[ADDRESS_741012] appropriate: 1) Veterans with 
knee pain desp ite NSAID use and/or 2) Veterans at relatively higher risk of NSAID toxicity 55-59 as ascertained 
by [CONTACT_109406] 1 or more of the following 4 criteria : 
• Answer affirmatively to the question: “Do you have some knee pain on most days over the past 3  month s?” 
• Have 1 or more risk factors for NSAID -induced nephrotoxicity (age greater than 60 years, atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease, current diuretic use, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure ([LOCATION_001] 
Heart Association class I –II. Note, Class III and IV are excluded).  
• Have 1 or more risk factors for NSAID -induced gastrointestinal  toxicity (history of peptic ulcer disease, age 
> 65 years, concurrent use of daily  ASA or corticosteroids) , and are currently on a gastro -protective agent.  
• Have 1 or more risk factors for NSAID -induced cardiovascular toxicity (prevalent cardiovascular disease, 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, family history of early heart disease or age greater 
than 55 years for women).

• Be using an NSAID (other than daily ASA) for knee pain  on most days of the month for at least  the past 3 
months.  
• Be able to understand and speak English  and have a telephone . 
• Be willing to engage in a CBT program, to discontinue (or replace) their NSAID, and to restrict co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564065] 14 weeks. 
Exclusion criteria are:  
• Subjects desiring escalation of analgesics for their current level of knee pain as determined by 
[CONTACT_564115]: “Is your knee pain bad enough that you want to talk to your doctor 
about taking stronger pain medications?”  
• Curre nt use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942]/or Celebrex.  
• Current use of an NSAID (not including ASA) for a painful condition in addition to  knee OA.   
• Contraindications to chronic NSAID use: current use of warfarin or antiplatelet agent other tha n ASA, 
allergy to any NSAID, active upper gastrointestinal ulceration in the previous [ADDRESS_741014] 6 months (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, coronary -
artery by[CONTACT_9292], invasive coronary revascularisation, or new -onset angina), severe congestive heart 
failure ([LOCATION_001] Heart Association class III –IV), evidence of serious anemia, hepatic, renal  (including 
nephrotic syndrome), or blood coagulation disorders, and pregnancy.  
***Though we are proposing a RWT – and thus will not be initiating NSAID therapy – it would not be 
appropriate to continue NSAIDs (even when  prescribed) in high -risk patie nts. We acknowledge that these 
exclusion criteria limit generalizability, but we feel they are justified to ensure subjects’ safety.***  
• Previous hyaluronic acid knee injections (within 6 months) or corticosteroid knee injections (within 3 
months).  
• Schedule d knee hyaluronic acid or corticosteroid injections, arthroscopy, or knee surgery.  
• Co-morbid conditions that include the following: known other causes of arthritis (infectious arthritis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissue disease, gout, pseudogout, or  psoriatic arthritis), peripheral 
neuropathy or cardiopulmonary disease that limits walking more than knee pain, bone metastases or 
Paget’s disease involving the lower extremities, and history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 2 
years, bilateral kne e replacements or knee pain in the replaced knee only.  
• Current involvement in litigation or receiving workmen’s compensation.  
• Hearing, cognitive impairment or mental illness, as determined by [CONTACT_564116] a CBT program.   
• For Women of Childbearing Age:  Must not currently be pregnant, agree to avoid getting pregnant during 
the course of the study and should inform the study team if pregnancy occurs at any time during study 
participation.  
• D.3 Screening Procedures : We will request the appropriate HIPAA and informed consent waivers to 
perform the searches described below. We have obtained waivers for similar screening and recruitment 
approaches in previous and ongoing studies.  
D.3.a RDW/CDW Search: We will identify potential Veterans for  inclusion from available EMR data in 
RDW/CDW. The VA RDW includes patient clinical data including demographics, encounters, vital signs, health 
factors and radiology reports. We will extend previously applied methods of information retrieval , concept 
indexing, and mappi[INVESTIGATOR_564066]. All Veterans [ADDRESS_741015] and the Providence VA Medical Center with a radiology report performed during 01/01/2007 -12/31/[ADDRESS_741016] used a similar 
approach previously for the Lung Cancer Tracking System developed at the VACHS. This approach uses 
10 
 radiology reports to identify patients with lung nodules using natural language proce ssing techniques for case 
management purposes. We will then identify Veterans in this group to exclude those who are taking 
medications such as Cox -2 inhibitors (other than meloxicam), warfarin, or antiplatelet drugs other than NSAIDs 
and ASA within the pa st [ADDRESS_741017] 6 months (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, coronary -artery by[CONTACT_9292], invasive 
coronary revascularisation, new -onset angina or congestive heart failure).  
D.3.b Chart Review:  For Veterans who remain potentially eligible, we will perform a focused EMR review to 
check for evidence of serious anemia, hepatic, renal, or blood coagulation disorders ; previous hyaluronic acid 
knee injections (within 6 months) or corticosteroid knee injections (within 3 months); co -morbid conditions that 
include the following: known other causes of arthritis (infectious arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissu e 
disease, gout, pseudogout, or psoriatic arthritis), peripheral neuropathy or cardiopulmonary disease that limits 
walking more than knee pain, bone metastases or Paget’s disease involving the lower extremities; history of 
drug or alcohol abuse within the past 2 years; bilateral knee replacements or knee pain limited to a single 
replaced knee; current involvement in litigation or receiving workmen’s compensation; and mental illness, 
hearing or cognitive impairment that would preclude participation in a CBT program.  
D.3.c Recruitment: We will use several methods of recruitment to maximize enrollment.  
• Mailings: Veterans meeting initial eligibility criteria will be sampled in blocks of [ADDRESS_741018] coordinator will telephone all pa tients who do not 
“opt out.” To minimize any intrusion on Veterans’ privacy, the project coordinator will be trained by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_564067]. Specifically, we will only telephone people during the day or 
early evening (7:00 -8:00). We will not contact [CONTACT_564117] (5:30 to 7:00). If someone other than 
the participant answers the telephone, we will not share any personal health information with the person 
who answers. We will attempt to reach each subject up to [ADDRESS_741019] from contact[CONTACT_564118].  
Telephone Screen: Those veterans who do not opt out will be telephoned to verify the remaining eligibility 
criteria: able to speak English; have a telephone; be using an NSAID, either by [CONTACT_564119], for knee pain (and 
not for any other painful condition) on most days over the past 3 months; do not desire escalation of 
analgesics;  do not have scheduled knee hyaluronic acid injections, corticosteroid injections, arthroscopy, or 
knee surgery; be willing to engage in a  CBT program, discontinue or replace their NSAID and restrict co -
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564068] 3 g daily ; do not have a hearing or cognitive impairment or mental illness 
precluding participation in a CBT program . And  for women of childbearing age, will verify they are not 
pregnant , are willing to avoid getting pregnant during study participation, and agree to a pregnancy test at time 
of consent . Ambiguous data retrieved during the VistA or chart screen will be clarified with subjects during the 
telephone  screen.  
Physician Referrals : Study Coordinator will inform Primary Care Doctors (PCPs), nurses, and health 
technicians in the outpatient clinics at VA CT and Providence VA Medical Center as well as coordinators of the 
MOVE program and Patient Education ab out the current study, and ask that they either (1) give out a flier to al l 
patients, age 20 or older with knee pain, so they can call Study Coordinator for more study information if 
interested in participation or 2) discuss the study with knee osteoarthri tis patients who meet eligibility criteria 
and have their interested patients sign a note that states their willingness to be contact[CONTACT_564120].  This note will also include the study team ’s telephone 
numbers in case patients would like to verify that this is a VA research project.  The same recruitment strategy 
will be employed at the Providence VA Medical Center with the exception that study fliers will not be given out 
to patients because  it will require them to make an out -of-state phone call.    
11 
 Study Fliers : Study fliers will be posted in all approved areas around the West Haven VA  In addition, these 
fliers will be left near check -in desks at all primary care and specialty clinics . 
D.4 Informed Consent:  At VACHS, the project coordinator  will describe the study and set up a clinic 
appointment for subjects who are eligible and interested in participating. The clinic appointment will be made at 
a time convenient for each patient. During the clinic appointment, the study procedures will be d escribed in 
detail and the project coordinator  will obtain written con sent. The purpose of the study,  all study procedures 
(including the run -in period), the process of randomization, the  procedures (discontinue NSAID,  be randomized 
to study drug versus pl acebo,  possibly participate in a CBT program after 4 weeks,  keep a daily medication 
diary, and provide outcome data each week), expected risks, expected benefits, alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], use of 
research results, special circumstances, and subjects’ rights w ill be discussed with each subject.  The 
participants will also be asked to sign a separate consent for audio recording of CBT phone sessions so that 
they do not have to return back to the VA at a later date should they be assigned to CBT in phase 2.  Fema le 
participants of childbearing age  will be given a lab slip to get a blood test at the VA laboratory at the time of 
signing consent form.  
The same procedures will be followed at Providence VA Medical Center, except that [CONTACT_564149] , [CONTACT_59894]  and/or 
their research assistant will meet with subjects to describe the study and obtain written consent.  
D.5 Run-In Period:  Subjects will be asked to participate in a [ADDRESS_741020] been shown to enhance a trial’s statistical power by [CONTACT_564121] 64. A run -in period is especially 
important in this t rial to ensure that we avoid a bias towards the null resulting from poor response to a new 
NSAID. Because patients are already on NSAIDs, a two -week period is adequate to determine whether they 
will experience a pain flare -up All subjects (including those currently taking meloxicam) will discontinue their 
current NSAID and be instructed to take meloxicam 15mg once a day with breakfast. Subjects will be aware 
that randomization to either the same active drug or to an identical placebo will occur for those rem aining 
eligible after [ADDRESS_741021].  
Subjects will r emain eligible if after the 2 -week run -in period they report having taken meloxicam  on 10 or more 
days , deny develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_564069], deny using arthritis medications for knee pain apart from 
acetaminophen  up to 3  g daily, and do not report worsening of knee pain on a 5 -point global impr ession of 
change scale (see D.11 .b). 
D.6 Intervention  
D.6.a Capsules: Active meloxicam and placebo capsules (both blue gel) will be supplied by [CONTACT_564122]. The active capsules will include 15mg of meloxicam and the placebo capsules will 
include excipi[INVESTIGATOR_190852]. The active capsules will be indistinguishable from the placebo capsules . Subjects will 
be instructed to take the capsules once a day.  Subjects can opt to either pi[INVESTIGATOR_564070].  They will be asked to either mail back unused study 
medications in a pre -paid, addressed envelope, or return them directly to the Research Pharmacy. Pharmacy 
will document  the study drug lots returned on a dispensing log and will subsequently dispose the remaining 
drugs accordance with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361].  
Subjects randomized to the placebo arm will discontinue study  medication  (meloxicam) after [ADDRESS_741022] meloxicam tablets  
administered at th e VA.  
D.6.b CBT: The CBT protocol includes 10 treatment modules delivered over 10 consecutive weeks (outlined in 
Table 1). We will allow the time frame to be extended by [ADDRESS_741023] of an in troductory module, followed by 8  pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_433714], and conclude with a 
module emphasizing skill consolidati on and relapse prevention. The 8  pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_564071]: 1) deep breathing 
and visual imagery, 2) progressive muscle relaxation, 3) physica l activity and body mechanics, 4) identifying 
unhealthy thoughts, 5) cognitive reframing, 6) managing stress, 7) time -based pacing, and 8 ) sleep hygiene. 
[ADDRESS_741024]. 
Kerns ( Efficacy of Tailored Cognitive -Behavior Therapy for Chronic Back Pain)  to be the most important, the 
most appealing, and the skills they were most confident they could engage in. The CBT protocol incorporates 
the materials used by [CONTACT_6283]. Kern, Otis and Keefe, who are the leading authorities in this field, and modifies them 
to suit our phone -based program for OA.  Given the variable pain levels  expected at study entry, pain 
management will not be the sole focus of treatment. In order to promote engagement, we will adopt a 
treatment approach that emphasizes general wellness benefi ts of the skills that are taught. All of the skills can 
promote general well -being, improved mood, and stress reduction. Additionally, skills such as exercise and 
proper body mechanics, confer joint protective benefits such as increased muscle strength and  flexibility, and 
can aid in weight management. These activities may also help slow progression of OA. When each skill is 
presented, participants will be told how the skill can be used during a pain flare and how it can be used to 
promote maximal physical and/or emotional functioning even in the absence of pain. For example, cognitive 
reframing techniques are effective in reducing pain catastrophizing that can impede the use of other pain 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_564072].

 Before the start of phase 2 , participants randomized to CBT will be mailed or  given a binder that includes 
handouts for each of the pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_564074], a CD to facilitate deep breathing and 
progressive muscle relaxation, and tracking goals sheets noting the copi[INVESTIGATOR_564075] . In order to foster patient comprehension of the materials, Plain Language Action and Information 
Network’s federal guidelines were used to enhance the handouts’ readability and to reduce the mean Kincaid 
reading level to a  9th grade level.  
The format of each session will include: 1) review of intersession goal accomplishment, previously assigned 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_564076], and other homework; 2) review of previously discussed material; 3) presentation of new 
material and new skills within a problem -solving framewor k; 4) in -session practice, covert rehearsal, or 
discussion of the application of new skills and 5) establishment of specific quantifiable and written intersession 
behavioral goals, expectations for skill practice, and other homework. Appropriate modificati ons will be made 
for the introductory and tenth  sessions.  
Beginning with the second treatment session, using procedures developed in a previous VA -funded study 
(Efficacy of Tailored Cognitive -Behavior Therapy for Chronic Back Pain, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_564077] ), the participants, in 
collaboration with their therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], will choose their own goals aimed at improving their quality of life. As 
participants progress through treatment, they will be encouraged to practice prior session copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], 
especially the on es that are reported to be effective, as well as continue to practice their “free choice” goals 
that target ways to improve well -being. Session 10  will emphasize sk ill consolidation and relapse prevention. 
An explicit review of skills learned during the tr eatment will be followed by a discussion targeting continued 
practice and application of skills. Areas of poor adherence to recommendations for skill practice and 
application will be explicitly addressed. The session will include elicitation of specific co ncerns about relapse 
and problem -solving discussion designed to reinforce perceptions of self -efficacy and a commitment to 
continued  skill application.  
D.6.c.1 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_62701]:  We pi[INVESTIGATOR_564078] (note that it was 12 weeks) and data collection 
procedures (see  D.12 ) with 14 participants: mean (SD) age = 68 (10)  years; 12 are White; 6 are married. Of 
the 165 CBT sessions  conducted, the a verage time per session was  33 minutes (range 20 -55). Subjects  were 
forthright when they had  only partially accomplish ed their homework, and were  able to brainstorm barriers to 
improve adherence. The subjects seem ed appreciative of the one -on-one time given to them and the 
opportunity to practice skills that might al leviate their knee pain.  
The baselines interviews require d between 14 and 29 minutes and the follow -up interviews between 9 and 15 
minutes to complete. The mean (SD) WOMAC pain score (possible range 0 -20) was = 7.3 (5.9) at baseline 
and 2.8 (2.9) at week 12. The mean (SD) ratings of the skills taught  (rated on a 5 -point scale 0 = Not at all and 
5 = Very Helpful) are provided in Table 2.

All 14 rated the amount of information presented as “Just right” (options: Too much, Not enough, Just right). 
Eleven rated the length of the calls as “Just right”, 2 as “Not enough” and 1 as “Too long” (options: Too long, 
Too short, Jus t right). 7 participants stated that they were “Very motivated” to continue practicing/implements 
14 
 learned skills, 4 stated that they were “Moderately” motivated, 3 “Somewhat”, 2 “A little” and 1 was “Not at all” 
motivated. Thirteen responded that they woul d recommend the program to another person with knee pain 
(Yes/No).  
D.7 Randomization and Allocation Concealment: An independent research associate not otherwise 
affiliated with the study will generate a computer generated randomization code. Subjects will be randomly 
assigned to the intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_564123] (≤ 8 vs > 8 on the WOMAC knee pain subscale). The cut -off point was chosen based on NSAID 
RCT outcome scores at [ADDRESS_741026] Haven 
patients,t he randomization code will be forwarded to the VACHS Research Pharmacy and will be used to label 
the study medication bottles. Random treatment assignments will be placed in numbered (so that all envelope s 
can be accounted for at the end of the study) opaque envelopes. Providence VA Pharmacy will be also be 
forwarded the randomization code for their own patients and label the study medication bottles accordingly .  
D.8 Blinding: The study personnel having direct contact [CONTACT_108804] , subjects, and other study personnel 
(PI, co -investigators, biostatistician and data manager) will be blind to treatment arm allocation. Blinding 
participants and study personnel is possible because the placebo and activ e capsules are indistinguishable. 
Although AEs associated with the active drug may threaten the blind, they are less likely to occur given that 
participants will all have taken NSAIDs regularly for at least [ADDRESS_741027] 
coordinator to guess group assignment (allowing for a “don’t know” option) at the end of Phase 1 73. We will 
also ascertain confidence (How confident are you that your guess is correct?) using a 5 -point Likert scale 
ranging from 1 = Not confident at all to 5 = Extremely confident.  
D.9 Expected Participant Flow: Our target sample size is 434 subjects (see sample size calculations in 
D.19 ). We will randomize 544 subjects to account for a possible 20% loss to follow -up. We will enroll  680 
subjects into the run -in period, to allow for a loss of up to 20% during the run -in period 64. This estimate is 
conservative, because many of the subjects will already be taking meloxicam and all have been able to tolerate 
NSAIDs for at least [ADDRESS_741028] disposition will be reported in agreement with CONSORT 
guidelines 74. The flow chart is included in Appendix 1. Reasons will be recorded to explain ineligibility and all 
dropouts.  
D.10  Data Collection Overview: Data will be collected using standardized questionnaires and forms. The 
project coordinator  will be trained to administer specific instruments during the start -up period.  Demographic 
and clinical characteristics, current medications, social support and expectations will be assessed at baseline.  
Knee pain severity will be collected at baseline and then weekly. Adherence to study drug, use of 
acetaminophen and other co -thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_014], AEs and goal attainment will be collected weekly. Lower extremity 
disability, subjects’ global impression of change, and the Health Utili ty Index Mark 3 (HUI3) (see D.20 .a) will be 
collec ted at baseline and then at the end of phase 2  (see Table 4). Outcome data will be collected by [CONTACT_564124].

D.[ADDRESS_741029] Characteristics: The following independent variables will be collected at baseline to help 
readers judge the generalizability of the results and to check comparability of the study groups at baseline.  
Sociodemographic characteristics : Age, gender, ethnicity, maximum level of education attained, employment 
status, and living arrangements (living with a spouse, another person, or alone) will be obtained by [CONTACT_6270] -report.  
Clinical characteristics : Overall health status and co -morbidity will be ascertained using the Arthritis Impact 
Measurement Scales 75. Body mass index will be obtained from the most recent EMR entry. Baseline knee 
pain and disability will be measured u sing the WOMAC (detailed in D.12 ). Psychiatric co -morbidities will be 
ascer tained by [CONTACT_14716].  
Current medications : Current medications will be obtained from the chart during the screening chart review and 
subsequently reconciled with each subject during the baseline interview. In case of discrepancies, the subject’s 
report w ill be used. Duration of NSAID use (for knee pain) will also be recorded. We will specifically inquire as 
to Rx and OTC medications, neutraceuticals and supplements.  
Social support : Social support will be measured using the 5 -item Modified Social Support S urvey. 
Psychometric properties of this instrument include the following: Cronbach’s alpha = 0.88, correlates highly 
with a measure of loneliness and companionship (convergent validity) and poorly with visual impairment 
(discriminant validity) 76. 
Expectations : Subjects’ expectations related to the benefits associated with NSAIDs will be assessed at 
baseline using a 5 -point scale ranging from 1 = Not at all effective to 5  = Extremely  effective. This measure will 
be repeated * to assess expectations related to CBT prior to the first session for subjects randomized to the 
CBT arm during Phase 2.  
D.12  Outcome Variables  
D.12 .a Primary Outcome:  The primary endpoint will be between -group dif ferences in the WOMAC pain score  
measured at [ADDRESS_741030] extensively validated and is 
recommended for (by [CONTACT_564125]) and widely used in OA trials 77,78.  
The WOMAC pain scale consists of 5 questions that ask about pain during walking, stair use, lying in bed at 
night, sitting, and standing. Each question is scored on a 5 -point scale, where 0 = None, 1 = Mild pain, 2 = 
Moderate pa in, 3 = Severe pain, and 4 = Very severe pain. Total pain scores range from 0 to 20 with higher 
scores reflecting worse pain . The WOMAC also includes a lower extremity disability scale. Both the pain scale 
and disability scale (17 items) can be analyzed se parately.  
Psychometric properties of the WOMAC scale include good internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha for the 
pain and disability scales = 0.81 and 0.91, respectively 79. The intraclass correlation coefficient for pain = 0.95 
and for physical function = 0.[ADDRESS_741031] Measurement Scales , the Doyle Index, 
16 
 the Lequesne Index, timed walk and range of motion (relative efficiency compared to other instruments > 1) 
77,83. Though the WOMAC is available using both visual analogue and Likert (WOMAC LK 3.1) scales, in this 
proposal we will use the latter because it has been validated for use over the  telephone 84.  
D.12 .b Secondary Outcomes  
Area under the curve (AUC) of the WOMAC pain scale score over the observation period : AUC will be 
measured in order to capture the variability in pain that is characteristic of knee OA 85,86. The AUC is a 
commonly used measure that combines mul tiple measurements over a specific time interval into a single index 
87. The AUC G provides a single score that quantifies each participant’s total WOMAC score across the 
repeated measurements. The formula is given as:  
 
Where m i denotes the measure at each time and t i denotes the time between measures. Because measures 
are collected w eekly, t i is a constant and can be dropped from the equation. The AUC G is valid regardless of 
increases or decreases in reported pain over time.  
Intermittent vs .Constant Pain : Measure  of Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain 
(http://www.oarsi.org/i ndex2.cfm?section=OARSI_Initiatives&content=Pain_Radiological_Indexes ) will be used 
to evaluate the subject’s pain experience, including pain intensity, frequency, as well as impact on mood, 
sleep, and quality of life. This 11 -item scale asks subjects to r ate their “constant knee pain” and their “knee 
pain that comes and goes” over the past week. Each item is scored on a scale from [ADDRESS_741032] of pain on physical functioning.  
Lower extremity disability : Lower extremity functional outcomes will be measured using the WOMAC disability 
scale (detailed in D.13.a ). The physical disability scale contains [ADDRESS_741033] as the pain scale.  
Global impression of change : To assess global improvement , we will use the Patient Global Impression of 
Change Sc ale, a balanced 7 -point scale (1 = Much better to 5  = Much worse ) asking subjects to rate their 
change (if any) in pain since starting the study  88. This item has been well -validated and is recommended as a 
core outcome measure by  [CONTACT_7902], Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials 89. 
Adherence to study medication and use of co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] : It is difficult to measure adherence and use of co -
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_14953] a clinical trial. This is especially true in this study where contact [CONTACT_564126]. We will ask patients to fill in daily medica tion diaries to 
record whether or not they took the study drug, the na mes of any additional co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_212980] (RX and/or 
OTC), and the occurrence of any AEs. Co-therapi[INVESTIGATOR_31430]: analgesics (RX and/or OTC) , supplements, 
and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_564081]. Eligible subjects will be instructed on how to fill in the diaries after 
they have agreed to participate. The diaries are meant to be used as reminders/cues during follow -up 
telephone calls. The project coordinator  will ask subjects to refer t o their diaries and will ascertain use of 
medications using the following questions:  
• Over the past week, how many d ays did you use the study drug for your knee pain?  
• Over the past week, how many days did you use Tylenol or acetaminophen for your knee pain ?  
• Over the past week, how many days did you use other medications that were pre scribed by [CONTACT_564127]?  
• Over the past week, how many days did you use other medications, creams or supplements that  you got 
without a prescription  for your knee pain?  
• Over the past week, how many days did you use any medications for a different problem or type of pain 
(e.g. headache)?  

17 
 We intentionally framed the questions so as to facilitate reporting difficulties wit h adherence or use of non -
permitted co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Although diaries are frequently used as a measure of adherence, the research team 
felt that asking subjects to mail back diaries each week would be overly burdensome and potentially result in 
greater amount s of missing data.  
Adverse events : AEs are generally collected using either an open -ended approach or a list of close -ended 
questions. A recent systematic review concluded that there have been too few studies to strongly recommend 
either one 90. We will use an open -ended approach to collect AEs. The project coordinator  will ask sub jects 
whether they have experienced any AEs (over the past week) on a weekly basis. We will also specifically 
inquire whether subjects have had interim medical visits, procedures, doctor visits, emergency room or urgent 
care visits, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. P ositive responses to any of these events will lead to focused chart reviews. 
AEs are f urther described in Section D.16 . 
D.13  Moderating Variable  
Goal attainment : For those randomized to CBT, t he extent to which each specified intersession goal  is met will 
be measured each week  using a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 = Did not work at all on goal(s)  to 10 = 
Complete d goal(s) .  
D.14  Retention:  Subjects will be paid $25 after the baseline inter view and $[ADDRESS_741034]. The experience of the PRIME Center’s personnel and the relationships they 
engender with study subjects is a major factor underlying the success of the trials conducted at our center.  
D.15  Treatment Fidelity:  To enhance CBT treatment fidelity we will 1) use treatment manuals and patient 
handouts that have been developed and previously  used at our center; 2) hire CBT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564082]; 3) include indi vidualized goals to motivate 
subjects; and 4) identify barriers towards skill practicing and goal attainment each week. To measure treatment 
fidelity , we will measure goal attainment weekly (see D.12 ). In addition, we will audiotape , to the extent 
possible , all treatment sessions using a digital phone recording system (Sparky+ USB Phone Call Recorder, 
V3) that records both sides of the telephone conversation. The phone recorder connects the phone to the 
computer such that phone calls can be recorded automat ically or manually. Calls are saved directly to the VA -
approved server and can be accessed using a username [CONTACT_564145]. Explicit consent will be 
obtained from subjects to audiotape these conversations. In our previous experience less than 2%  of subjects 
refused to be audiotaped during CBT session s.  
Dr. H eapy  and the psychology technician s will listen to a random 10% of the other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s CBT sessions to 
ensure adherence to the treatment manual. Adherence will be measured using a modified version of the Yale 
Adherence and Competence System -Second Edition (YACS -II) 91. This scale allows for the systematic 
evaluation of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564083] -specified elements of the treatment such as rationale for, and 
explanation of each copi[INVESTIGATOR_104285], setting of skill pra ctice goals, encouragement of self -monitoring, rapport 
building and adherence to session time limits. Drs. Heapy and the psychology technician s will meet weekly to 
review the rated sessions, note and reinforce successful adherence to the manual and provide  corrective 
feedback to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564084].  
D.16  Safety  
D.16 .a Notification of Patients and Providers: Patients will receive information about the risks of NSAIDs 
during the consent process. All providers in the VACHS and Prov idence VA Medical Center will be notified 
about the research project by [CONTACT_564128] [INVESTIGATOR_564085], prior to study onset and every [ADDRESS_741035] contraindication s to NSAID use or are taking a high risk combination of antiplatelet and/or 
anticoagulant medications. We will also notify providers of AEs developi[INVESTIGATOR_564086].  
D.16 .b Adverse Event Monitoring:  CBT is not associated with any expected AEs apart from the 
inconvenience associated with participating in the telephone sessions and practicing the required skills. Few 
[ADDRESS_741036] (DSMB) within [ADDRESS_741037] team will review a cumulative report of unexpected and 
moderate to severe AEs every 4 weeks (or more often if necessary). The Committee will confirm or modify the 
PI’s assessment in  order to ensure that no concerning patterns of AEs emerge.  
D.16.c Suicide Ideation : If a research team member learns of suicidal ideation with a subject during a 
telephone session, the team member may ask three additional questions to gather important inf ormation to 
provide for the VA Suicide Hotline so that they can assess if the subject is in imminent danger. If suicidal 
ideation is expressed, the following three questions may be asked:  
 
1. Have you ever tried to kill yourself?  
2. Do you have any specific pla ns to kill yourself now?  
3. Do you have the means to carry out those plans?  
 
If the team member is able to immediately determine that the subject is an imminent threat, then the “warm 
transfer” (established guidelines between VA National Suicide Prevention Hotline and CSRDS) will be by -
passed and local law enforcement authorities w ill be contact[CONTACT_564129] a mental health provider, emergency room, urgent care, etc. Otherwise, 
the subject will undergo the “warm transfer” as needed. These individuals will b e dropped from the study.  
 
D.16 .d Adverse Event Classification and Grading: We will classify AEs by [CONTACT_34565]  (gastrointestinal, 
renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, other) 52. AEs will be further classified by [CONTACT_564130]/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. We will use the Naranjo algorithm to estimate the probability that the study drug caused 
the AE 92. Two physicians (LF and LS) will independently score each AE using the Adverse Drug Reaction 
probability scale 92. This validated scale includes 10 items coded as Yes, No or Do not know. A scoring 
algorithm generates a total score with a possible range of -4 to +13. AEs with scores of ≥ 9 are classified as 
definite; 5 -8 as probable; 1 -4 as po ssible, and < [ADDRESS_741038] high within 
and inter -rater reliability (r = 0.91 -0.98 and r = 0.84 to 0.93 respectively) 92. Disagreements will be adjudicated 
by a third VA physician ([CONTACT_564150]; Section of Gastroenterology, VA CT - see letter of support). The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_564087] v.2.0 listed in Table 5 93: 
Table  5. Adverse Event Severity  
Category  Definition  
Mild Asymptomatic, short duration (< 1 week), no change in lifestyle, no Rx required  
Moderate  Symptomatic, duration 1 -2 weeks, occasionally alters lifestyle, Rx provides relief  
Severe  Prolonged symptoms, major fu nctional impairment, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] < 24 hrs  
Life threatening  At risk of death or substantial disability, especially if permanent, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] > 24 hrs  
D.17  Sample Size Calculations : The primary endpoint is the difference in mean pain scores between the 
NSAID and placebo groups  (as measured by [CONTACT_564131]) at 4 weeks. The sample size was 
calculated using NCSS/PASS [ADDRESS_741039] of The Differe nce of 2 Means: 
Numeric Results for Non -Inferiority Test (H0: D >= |E|; H1: D < |E|); where |E| is the magnitude of the margin of 
equivalence. D is the mean difference at which the power is computed. D = Mean1 - Mean2.  
The range of the WOMAC pain subscale  is 0-20 and the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is         
2.1 72,94. We set the equivalence margin to 1.0 which is le ss than 50% of the MCID. A sample size of 434 (217 
per arm) achieves 90% power to detect non -inferiority using a [ADDRESS_741040] is 
19 
 recommended for non -inferiority trials. The true difference between  the means is assumed to be 0.00 . The 
significance level (alpha) of the test is conservatively set at 0.025. The data are drawn from populations with 
standard deviations of 3.20 83. 
We will enroll 680 subjects in the 2 -week run -in period to account for a possible 20% loss. We will randomize 
544 subjects to enable a further 20% loss over the 4 -week withdrawal period. The use of a run -in period and a 
RWT design both tend to decrease the  required samples size; therefore these estimates are conservative.  
Assuming a further 25% loss in Phase 2, we will have 80% power to detect non -inferiority under the same 
assumptions.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] /Removal from Study :  
If patient reports use of another NSAID beside meloxicam and, desp ite being asked to stop, is unable to do so  
over the subsequent week, he will be removed from the study.   
If patient reports taking more than the maximum dose of 3 g of Tylenol daily, and , despi[INVESTIGATOR_564088], he will be removed from the study.  
We will not include stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_564089], because:  
1) All subjects are receiving therapy for knee pain.  
2) Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_564090] t typi[INVESTIGATOR_564091], including withdrawal trials.  
3) Analgesic use will be recorded and accounted for in the analyses . 
Patients reporting an escalation of pain will only be removed from the study if they are unable to comply with 
the s tudy regulations and the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_564092].  
D.18  Analyses of Aims 1 and 2  
D.18 .a Phase 1 Analyses  
Hypothesis 1: Subjects randomized to placebo will not experience more knee pain than subjects 
randomized to continue  NSAID s at 4 weeks.   
All analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The SAS t -test procedure  
will be u sed to calculate the means and standard deviations of each group, and the 95% CI of the difference. 
Both intention -to-treat (ITT) and per -protocol (PP) analyses will be conducted, and compared. The model will 
be adjusted for study site and the treatment co variates will be  represented by [CONTACT_564132]. We will utilize 
multiple imputation methods to account for missing WOMAC scores, and compare the results of imputed 
models to both ITT and PP analyses 95,96. Multiple imputation is a Monte Carlo technique in which the missing 
values are replaced by m>1 simulated versions. In Rubin's method for “repeated imputation” inference 95, each 
of the  simulated complete datasets is analyzed by [CONTACT_10062], and the results are combined to produce 
estimates and confidence intervals that incorporate missing -data uncertainty.  
The adequacy of the randomization will be assessed by [CONTACT_564133] 2 treatment groups. Variables will be summarized (means, proportions, etc.) and 
continuous variables will be compared using 2-sample t -tests, while differences in categorical variables will be 
examined usin g chi -square tests. Characteristics found to be significantly different between conditions will be 
included as covariates in subsequent analyses to determine if they alter the conclusions of the study. The 
success of blinding will be compared across groups  using chi -square tests and 2-sample t -tests for the 
proportion guessing correctly and confidence ratings, respectively.  
Hypothesis 2: The AUC score in the placebo arm will not differ from the AUC in the continued NSAID 
arm at [ADDRESS_741041] deviations of each group AUC 
score, and the 95% CI of the difference. Both intention -to-treat (ITT) and per -protocol (PP) analyses will be 
conducted and compared . 
D.18 .b Phase 2 Analyses  
20 
 Hypothesis  3: Subjects participating in the CBT program will not experience more knee pain than 
subjects continuing NSAID s at [ADDRESS_741042] deviations of each group and the 
95% CI of the difference as described in Hypothesis 1.  
Hypothesis 4: The AUC score in the CBT arm will not differ from the AUC in the continued NSAID arm 
at [ADDRESS_741043] deviations of each group AUC 
score, and the 95% CI of the difference as described in Hypothesis 2.  
Hypothesis 5 : Subjects participating in the CBT program will not report greater overall worsening 
(global change) or levels of lower extremity disability compared to subjects randomi zed to continued 
NSAID use.  
We will use linear mixed effects (LME) models to  examine differences in the slope of global change and 
disability by [CONTACT_564134]. LME models  account for the clustering induced by [CONTACT_564135] -groups and within -subject effects, allows for missing data, and 
measurements at different time intervals. Data from different subjects are assumed to be independent, while 
the correlation structure of the repeated measurements within subjects is modeled via parameterization of the 
covariance structure. Analyses will be performed using SAS PROC MIXED. Dichotomized variables will be 
analyzed using generalized estimating equations.  
Hypothesis 6 : Subjects participating in the CBT program will not report greater use of co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564093] . 
Group differences in the number of days using co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564094], a count variable, will be modeled using 
Poisson regres sion analysis 97. We will correct for overdispersion - a common problem in Poisson models that 
occurs when the variance of the count dependent variable is greater than the mean - by [CONTACT_564136]. Incidence rate ratios representing the 
risk of co -therapy use will be obtained from model results by [CONTACT_564137]. We will 
also examine the moderating effect of goal attainment on co -therapy use.  
Hypothesis 7 : Goal attainment will be associated with improved primary and secondary outcomes.   
We will use latent class regression analysis to model the longitudinal trajectory of the 0-10 weekly  ratings of 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_564095], disability, global change and co -therapy use at 3 months  98. These 
models allow for the regression parameters to di ffer across the unobserved (latent) groups trajectories, and are 
performed in a single model. LME models and multiple imputation methods will be used  to model missing 
outcome data because they have been shown to be superior to other methods, such as last o bservation 
carried forward, in the analysis of repeated measures data 74,99. 
Aim 3: To estimate the p otential cost-effectiveness of CBT compared with continued NSAID use.  
D.19  Healthcare Utilization:  Subjects’ OA -related healthcare utilization will be measured using VA Regional 
Data Warehouse (RDW) data for all OA -related outpatient visits (emergency room, primary care, urgent care, 
rheumatology, orthopedic surgery, physical therapy, and pain manageme nt clinics) over [ADDRESS_741044] -study utilization and the persistence of any intervention effects ov er 
time. RDW data will also be used to identify the total number of consults placed to the Bone and Joint Clinic 
(both orthopedic and rheumatology referrals) , Physiatrists , pain management and physical therapy for all study 
subjects. Within -group differenc es in total number of OA -related outpatient, urgent care and emergency room 
visits and consults for both treatment arms will be evaluated using paired t -tests. Between -group differences in 
the change in total OA -related outpatient, urgent care and emergenc y room visits and consults over the [ADDRESS_741045] -Effectiveness: To evaluate the short - and long -term health and economic benefits of discontinuing 
NSAIDs and then starting CBT, we will compare OA -related VA health services utilization, total direct medical 
costs, and the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (in US dollars per quality -adjusted life -year) associated with 
continued NSAID use versus CBT at [ADDRESS_741046] -Effectiveness:  To estimate cost -effectiveness of the placebo followed by [CONTACT_564138] [ADDRESS_741047] -effectiveness 
ratio (ICER), reported in 2011 US dollars per quality -adjusted li fe-year (QALY) gained, for each treatment arm, 
including the withdrawal period. QALYs will be estimated using the HUI3. The HUI3 is a generic, preference -
weighted health status instrument  that evaluates 8 attributes (vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, 
emotion, cognition and pain/discomfort), each coded using [ADDRESS_741048] the HUI3 at baseline and then 
monthly in order to provide a complete AUC for quality of life estimation during the study period.  Costs will be 
estimated from the VA’s perspective. Costs will consist of treatment -specific costs, OA -related health services 
utilization costs and costs associated with AEs. All cost data will be obtained from the VA Decision Support 
System National Data Extracts. For the NSAID arm (referent), treatment costs will consist of outpatient 
pharmacy costs derived from VA pharmacy cost data combined with the mean daily pi[INVESTIGATOR_564096] [ADDRESS_741049] -Effectiveness Analysis of the U.S. Public Service’s 
recommendations  103. 
D.[ADDRESS_741050] -Effectiveness:  To extrapolate the longer -term economic value of CBT, we will 
estimate [ADDRESS_741051] of how quickly (if at all) CBT efficacy wanes without additional interventions  (Table 6) . 
In addition, we will explore the cost -effectiveness of repeating an a bbreviated CBT program (10 weeks ) at 
varying intervals to allow extrapolation to 10 years  (Table 6) . We will examine [ADDRESS_741052] 
assumptions (lowest, average and highest co st accrued over study period extrapolated over 1 and 10 years). 
We will assume a range of long -term efficacy and AEs associated with NSAIDs drawn from the published 
literature. We will calculate [ADDRESS_741053] and 
20% percent effort of an administrator to process referrals. In order to calculate the [ADDRESS_741054] over 10 years  
D.20 .c Model: The Markov model will be comprised of 19 health states representing 9 strata of knee pain and 
functional status (defined by [CONTACT_564139], 
respectively) , presence or absence of severe treatment -related AEs (e.g., gastrointestinal bleed or renal failure 
requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and death. The cycle length will be [ADDRESS_741055] of mild AEs on QALYs will be averaged over all health 
states for a given treatment strategy, but will not incur additional costs.  
22 
 We will use TreeAge, a simulation software package that combines decision analysis and state transition or 
Markov processes with detailed outputs containing all internal calculations for model debugging and internal 
validation. We will run the model as a Monte Carlo simulation, where each hypothetical patient proceeds 
through varying clinical stages of disease or even ts 107. This type of simulation is probabilistic : the modeler 
defines the overall probability of a particular event occurring, but does not know ahead of time whether a 
particular event will happen to a particular simulated patient (unless specified probability is exactly “1” or “0”). 
Monte Carlo simulation provides several advantages. First, the model produces a distribution of results for the 
outcome of intere st, more accurately representing the heterogeneity observed in real populations. Second, it is 
possible to run the model to reflect areas of uncertainty without altering the model structure, which is valuable 
when data on probability estimates are limited.  We will employ a systematic validation approach [ADDRESS_741056] analyses of variables over plausible ranges using numeric and graphic assessment of results 108. We 
will also examine extreme scenarios where the outcome is clinically obvious. The model will estimate 1 - and 
10-year costs and QALYs associated with placebo followed by [CONTACT_252017] v ersus continued NSAID use under the 
assumptions described above, and allow calculation of the 1 - and 10 -year ICERs. Costs and QALYs will be 
discounted at 3% per year.  
Hypothesis 8 : Discontinuing NSAIDs and initiating CBT will result in a greater overall reduction in VA 
health services utilization compared to continued NSAID use.   
Documented reductions in health care utilization among participants during the study may be due either to 
greater clinical effect of CBT versus NSAIDs, or alternatively, to an effect of study participation independent of 
treatment effect. We will quantify the impact of potential protocol -induced reductions in health care utilization 
on cost -effectiveness by [CONTACT_564140]: 1) no chan ge in utilization in 
either treatment group, 2) equal reductions in both groups, and 3) greater reductions in the CBT versus 
continued NSAID group. We will also define utilization thresholds at which the favored strategy (CBT versus 
continued NSAID) change s. 
Hypothesis 9 : Discontinuing NSAIDs and initiating CBT will offer cost savings compared to continued 
NSAID use when considered over a [ADDRESS_741057]-effectiveness, thereby [CONTACT_564141], health care utilization and NSAID toxicity at 
which the favored strategy changes . 
D.21  Data Management: Data management will be led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cynthia Brandt, Director of the Prime Center’s 
Informatics Core. [CONTACT_564147] has extensive experience in study design, preparation of study forms, and 
management of data and preparation of reports. [CONTACT_564147], along with the data manager, will develop a Data 
Management Operations Manual during the study start -up period to describe the computing environment, data 
entry and data management procedures. She will oversee interim monitoring to track enrollment, protocol 
adherence, completeness of data collection, safety, and adherence. This monitoring  will be performed by [CONTACT_235039]/data manager (blinded to treatment assignment). Aggregate results (both groups combined) will be 
reported on a weekly basis to the PI. Results by [CONTACT_19313] (without group labels) will be reported every 6 months to 
the DSMB.  
D.21 .a Clinical Study Data Management System: We will use RedCap, a software application that supports 
computerized interviews, batch data entry, and basic project administration. Using this existing flexible 
database will substantially reduce time require d for the database development and data management. Survey 
data will be entered into electronic forms. Data reports and SAS extracts for statistical analysis will be made 
available on the VA server to authorized researchers  
D.21 .b Quality Assurance and Con trol: We will hold biweekly progress reports with all research personnel to 
monitor enrollment, adherence to the study protocol and AEs. Personnel will be trained to enter data into 
RedCap . All data entry will be [ADDRESS_741058] completed the defined cycle of e ntry, verification, and editing  are 
considered “clean” and can be “locked”.  Logic checks and range limits are built into the forms and w ill be used 
to facilitate quality data at the time of entry. Enrollment, survey completion and data entry quality and 
timeliness of entry will be monitored weekly with reports. The data manager will check for data inconsistencies, 
omissions, and errors reg ularly. Data questions or problems will trigger data queries and analyses of missing 
data will be done periodically to ensure that all forms are entered and available for analysis. RedCap  maintains 
an electronic audit trail of all modifications to a study’ s data, including the user who made the change, the date 
and time, and each data item changed and its previous value and new value. Several levels of backup of the 
database will be performed on a regular basis, including full backup daily and incremental b ackup during the 
day. 
D.23 .c Data Security: All data will be handled in accordance with VA Office of Research and Development 
regulations. Several layers of security will be employed to protect study data, such as: a) login procedures with 
usernames and passwords for access to the data, b) storage of data on the VA SQL Server , and c) disaster 
recovery procedures with redun dant data storage and backup. RedCap  implements a variety of other security 
features at several different levels, includi ng “role -based” user privileges. The person in charge of the study 
can specify, for example, that a particular person is allowed 1) “read only” access to that study’s data, 2) 
“read/edit” access, 3) the ability to see only certain case report forms, and/or  4) the ability to run reports or 
export data for analysis.  All data will be kept in a unique study file with a unique study identification number. 
The study files containing these data will not contain any identifying information. A separate file will lin k study 
identification numbers with participants’ names and telephone numbers. All study staff will receive HIPAA 
training and Human Subjects Protection training. Users will certify that they are HIPAA trained and will act in 
full compliance of HIPAA regul ations.   
E. POTENTIAL PI[INVESTIGATOR_564097]. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that it is 
always difficult to recruit for a clinical trial. Therefore, we will track enrollment carefully, and should we fail to 
meet predefined enrollment goals, we will expand to include other VA Medical Centers within VISN1. 
Expanding the number of sites is feasible  because all procedures and data are collected by [CONTACT_756]. 
Because the study design does not include in -person assessments, we are not able to obtain “objective” 
measures of disease activity or performance. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, we would not expec t any changes in 
physical examination or laboratory findings in the majority of subjects over the course of the proposed study. 
However, lower extremity performance measures (e.g. timed walk or sit -to-stand tests) can add valuable 
information in OA clinica l trials. After extensive discussion with the research team and other experts in OA, it 
was decided that asking subjects to come to the VA to perform a battery of lower extremity function tests was 
not warranted given that our primary objective was to addr ess the needs of Veterans having limited access to 
VA services, all other aspects of the study are conducted by [CONTACT_756], and lower extremity function will be 
partially assessed using a well -validated self -report measure. We will use diaries to help subje cts keep track of 
medication use (study drug and co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), but will not use the diaries as an outcome measure because 
having subjects mail them back would be burdensome and risk leading to substantial missing data. Given that 
a RWT for NSAIDs has not yet been done, we felt that it was important to demonstrate short -term efficacy first; 
thus long -term effectiveness will not be evaluated.  
F. DISSEMINATION PLAN  
The results of this study will be relevant to patients, providers who care for patients with kn ee OA, 
implementation and health services researchers, and policy makers who are responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_564098]. Dissemination activities will include presenting study results to 
patients at patient education ev ents, and to researchers at local and national conferences. Additional 
presentations to healthcare providers will occur at the VA Rheumatology Consortium annual meetings and in 
relevant seminars and CME programs. All presentations will include development and dissemination of project -
related issue briefs, slide presentation sets, and printed materials. An additional strategy for dissemination of 
findings will be via the preparation and distribution of summary reports. The Coordinating Committee will 
advise and coordinate next steps for dissemination, including dissemination to other relevant entities such as 
Pain Management Coordination teams and committees  and the Pain Management Education, Guidelines, 
[ADDRESS_741059] a summary of the study findings and 
implications on the Pain Management Committee’s website in a format appropriate for VA patients. We will call 
on the expertise of the National Pain Research Working Group to assist in dissemination of the re sults of this 
study. Over 80 VA and non -VA pain -relevant investigators form this network that serves multiple goals 
including identification of priorities for pain research, advocacy to promote increased funding for pain -relevant 
research, development of c ollaborative research projects, and communication and dissemination of research 
findings. Among several specific projects, this group has published special issues of 3 journals on pain and 
pain management that highlight pain research in the VHA. Face -to-face meetings of the group occur on an 
annual basis and further foster communication and collaboration in conjunction with the National HSR&D 
meeting.  
Finally, in collaboration with the Center for Information Dissemination and Educational Research, informat ion 
from this project will be disseminated via cyber seminars, a state -of-the-art, web -based conferencing 
technology that enables dynamic interaction among presenters and seminar participants from one’s desktop. In 
addition, archived versions of seminars a re available on the web for viewing on demand. Dissemination efforts 
will be facilitated by [CONTACT_50783]’s close collaboration and association with the VA Rheumatology Consortium and 
the VHA National Pain Management Strategy Coordinating Committee. This commit tee, chaired by [CONTACT_564142] -
Investigator [CONTACT_564151], was established in [ADDRESS_741060]. Kerns will not only help ensure that the study produces findings that are quickly 
actionable, but will also provide a national infrastructure for r apid dissemination.  
The dissemination of telephone -based CBT will be facilitated by [CONTACT_564143] -based psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The Evidence -Based 
Psychotherapy (EB P) initiative, includes a national training program that provides in -person training workshops 
in evidence -based psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_564099] [ADDRESS_741061]. John McKellar, Training Coordinator of CBT for Chronic Pain Management, estimates that 
approximately 560 -640 mental health providers will complete the training over the course of the rollout. Thus, 
the expertise to deliver CBT for chronic pain will be increasingly available within VA through this ongoing 
initiative without the need for further investment of resources.  
G. HUMAN SUBJECTS : Details related to the inclusion of human subjects are included as a separate 
attachment.  
H. WOMEN AND MINORITIES : At VACHS, approximately 85% of Veterans are White, 14% are Black, 0.3% 
are Pacific Islanders, 0.2% are Native American, and 0.1% are Asian. We will oversample women and Black 
Veterans in order to represent these demographic groups as best as possible.  The CT and RI VA medical 
centers serve overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_564100].  There are approximately 2,[ADDRESS_741062] MANAGEMENT PLAN  
I.1 Plan and Timeline:  The project timeline, (see Gantt chart , Appendix 3), indicates that in the first quarter of 
year one, we will hire and train a project coordinator  and [ADDRESS_741063]

meetings with the PI, CBT  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], project coordinator and data manager will occur throughout the [ADDRESS_741064] data will occur in  
Year 4. Concentrated work on manuscript preparation and dissemination will occur in the latter half of Year 4.

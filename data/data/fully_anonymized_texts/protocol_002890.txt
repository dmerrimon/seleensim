 (302) [ADDRESS_1106127] common chronic disease of childhood with significant morbidity , mortality , and 
economic burden  in the [LOCATION_002] and in Delaware.  Asthma affects up to 6 million children in the United 
States (US) with estimated healthcare costs of $81 billion annually.1,25 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_801336], asthma -related deaths continue to occur 
with over 3,000 deaths annually in the US.1 DE, in particular, is a national asthma hotspot with a higher than 
average prevalence of childhood asthma (12%).2 Over 25% of DE high  school students report a lifetime diagnosis 
of asthma, with even higher rates for racial and ethnically minoritized  children. Of those children with asthma in 
DE, 65% experienced an asthma -related visit to their doctor in the past year.2,26  
 
Asthma dispr oportionally affects minorit ized and underserved children who are also less likely to 
receive specialty care and routine lung function measurements.  In the US, asthma burden disproportionally 
affects minorit ized and economically disadvantaged children wit h higher rates among non -Hispanic Black 
children (14.5%) compared to non -Hispanic White (8.2%) children.1 There are also higher rates of asthma among 
individuals of lower socioeconomic status1  and children  who live in rural areas .27 Rates of asthma -relate d deaths 
are twice as high for Black Americans compared to White Americans (21.8 v. 9.5 deaths per million).1 Among 
children with asthma in DE with near -fatal asthma requiring ECMO support, 100% were Black and utilized 
Medicaid as insurance.[ADDRESS_1106128] show n improved symptom control;39, 
[ADDRESS_1106129] function in the 
home setting  and provid e objective data to both patients and care tea ms. Preliminary data show positive 
acceptance and feasibility of using this novel technology with children with asthma and CF.17-21 However, there 
are limited data regarding the use of mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_801337] . In particular, there is l ittle data regarding 
their use in children from rural and underserved areas , a group at higher risk for asthma -related morbidity and 
mortality due to decreased access to care.  The utilization of technology -enhanced monitoring for asthma in the 
home setting is a  novel approach to engag ing patients and families in specialty care without the excessive burden 
of travel and time.  Prior to large -scale interventional studies, it is imperative to assess the feasibility, accessibility, 
and acceptability of this approach  as well as any unique concerns regarding the use of such technology specific 
to this population.  
 
Recruitment and Enrollment  
 
Study Eligibility  
• Children with persistent asthma (defined as using at least one controller medication or asthma) ages 12 -
17  
• Followed by [CONTACT_801358] a primary care practice which meets HRSA criteria as rural 
or medically -underserved  
• Participants must be able to speak and read English.  
• Access to a mobile device with internet connectivity  
• Ability to follow directions to perform study measures  
 
Exclusion criteria   
• Significant cardiopulmonary disease other than asthma (Examples: Cystic Fibrosis, complex congenital 
heart disease)  
• Non-English Speaking  
 
Enrollment targets  
• [ADDRESS_1106130] in participation, the initial research visit (including consent/ass ent 
discussion and documentation and completion of initial study measures) will be scheduled at the Milford or 
Wilmington outpatient pulmonology office.  
 
Study Procedure s 
 
 
 
 
 
This technology -enhanced asthma pi[INVESTIGATOR_801338] 24 weeks  using a hybrid approach with 
remote and in -person research visits. Participants with persistent asthma ages 12 -17 will be recruited from 
Nemours DE Healthcare System Pulmonology Division.   
 
The initial (week 0) and final (week 24) visits will be completed as in-person visits in the Wilmington or Milford, 
DE, Nemours outpatient pulmonology office. At the initial visit, study measures will be completed, and 
participants will be trained on the use of technology for future remote visits (mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_201992] c onnected 
to mobile application for reporting of results and the use of the telehealth platform). At the initial study visit, in -
office (gold standard) spi[INVESTIGATOR_801339]. Interval monthly visits at weeks 
4, 8, 12, 16,  and 20 will be completed using remote study procedures with completion of mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_801340].  See Table 1 for study timeline.  The final study visit at week 24 will 
include similar procedures as week 0, includin g in-office spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] . 
 
After completing consent/assent procedures  during  study visit [ADDRESS_1106131] 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_801341] -based pulmonary function equipment (Carefusion Vitalmax ™), mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (using 
the MIR Spi[INVESTIGATOR_91455] ™ spi[INVESTIGATOR_801342]® mobile application) will be completed, as 
well as training on the mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_801343]. If participants are unable to complete  
reliable spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (either standard or mobile after [ADDRESS_1106132] ATS criteria for acceptable 
technique), are unable to understand study measures, or if there are any other concerns about participation, the 
participant will be considered a scr een failure and the reasons for screen failure recorded.  
 
At the time of the initial study visit, participants will receive the mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_801344] a mobile application for results report generation for future visit s. The initial study visit will take 
approximately 2 hours for baseline testing, training, and collection of data. Subsequent study visits will be 
completed at 4 -week intervals using a remote video platform with a member of the research team available to 
help complete study measures and, if needed, “coach” the participant during completion of mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  
(see Table 1) . The participants will be instructed to complete mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_801345]. The participant will be given [ADDRESS_1106133] technique or technical concerns. If the participant is unable to achieve 
reliable results within 8 attempts, the participant will be instructed to stop testing at that  time, and additional 
participant -specific re -training/education will be completed. Time for mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_801346] 5 -10 minutes. Reasons for inability to complete the mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (e.g. technical concerns , patient 
effort ) will be recorded at each visit.  
 
The estimated time for the remote visit is estimated to be 20-[ADDRESS_1106134] (ACT®)23 will be 
completed at each study visit as well as the 10 -item Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_269985] 
(ESS -CHAD).[ADDRESS_1106135] at the time of study consent, which will be loaded 
with $25 after each in -person study visit and $10 after each remote visit ($100 total for completion of all visits) . 
 
All paper forms used in the study (e.g., questionnaires) will be kept in a locked file cabinet. Only members of 
the research team will have access to the human subjects’ data and identifying information. All data will be 
identified only by [CONTACT_801359]’ iden tities to the code numbers, as well as 
consent forms with participant names, will be kept in a password protected excel sheet on the Nemours secure 
server. All electronic study data will be stored in a folder on the Nemours secure shared drive, separate fr om 
the document linking participants to subject IDs, and only study personnel will have access to this folder.

Statistical Considerations  
 
The primary outcome of feasibility  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_801360] (e.g. percent of approached individuals who consent to participant, percent of enrolled participants 
who complete each study visit) . The percent of patients who are successful at producing mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_801347]. The percentage of participants who require additional training 
sessions due to difficulty using the device will be calculated. To me asure acceptability , the Satisfaction and 
Usability Survey will be reviewed at the item -level, and specifically, responses of “agree” or “strongly agree” will 
be used as benchmarks of acceptability and feasibility of each item. Responses to the open -ended questions 
will be analyzed for consistent themes across participants. Finally, to measure accessibility , the investigators 
will measure the length of time required to complete all visits and the frequency of any technical or connectivity 
issues. The invest igators will meet regularly to review data management procedures and discuss any errors. 
Prior to beginning analyses, the investigators will examine the distribution of the data and identify any potential 
outliers. The investigators will consult closely wi th the REACH Center  biostatistician in analyz ing the data. 
 
Descriptive and comparative statistics will be employed to characterize patient factors associated with successful 
study completion  (completion of ≥80% of study measures) . Categorical variables wi ll be summarized by 
[CONTACT_22977], and continuous variables summarized by [CONTACT_48360]. 
Correlations will be utilized to determine whether any patient factors (e.g. age, grade in school, severity of 
asthma) are associated with successful completion of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]  (completion of ≥80% of study measures) . For 
specific Aim 3, changes in asthma control and  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_801348]. 
Data distributions and change over time will be evaluated . Mean di fferences will be tested for statistical 
significance using ANOVA.

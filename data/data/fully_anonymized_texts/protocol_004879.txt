The entire stud y per subject will last up to  34 days. This will include a screening period of 
up to 28 days  prior  to Admission (Day -29 to Day -2), 3 days of confinement ( after 
enrollment on Day -1 to time of discharge on Day 3, (3 overnight stays ), and a 3-day Safety 
Follow -Up (from time of Discharge at Day 3 until Day 6). The end of the study (EOS) for a 
subject is defined as the end of  the Safety Follow -up Period. The end of the whole study 
corresponds to the individual EOS of the last subject.  
Statistical Methods:  
Demographics and baseline characteristics  will be analyzed on the randomized and PK 
populations.  
PK, PD, HPT and extent of  product use endpoints  will be analyzed on the randomized and 
the PK population.  
Safety will be analyzed using the safety population.  
Nicotine PK endpoints will be derived from the background -corrected plasma nicotine 
concentrations.  Nicotine PK parameters will be derived from background -corrected plasma 
nicotine concentration versus time data using a non -compartmental analysis (NCA) 
technique.  
All data will be presented in listings, ordered by [CONTACT_1130], study visit, product and time po int, 
unless otherwise specified.  
All endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics including number of subjects 
(n), number and percent of subjects with missing data, arithmetic means , and standard 
deviations (mean and SD), median, first and th ird quartiles, minimum and maximum.  
For log normally distributed endpoints, geometric mean, geometric CV and geometric CI 
will be presented in addition.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_610406] (number and percentage).  
For endpoints relating to sampling times (e.g., T max), only median, first and third quartiles, 
and minimum and maximum will be presented.  
All analyses and summaries will be performed by [CONTACT_231517].  
A mixed model  analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted on A UC 0-2min, AUC 0-4min, 
AUC 0-Tmax, AUC 0-10h, AUC 0-last, AUC 0-infinity,  max(Ct/t)t∈]0,Tmax]  and C max endpoints in the 
natural logarithmic scale. The results of this analysis will be presented in terms of geometric 
least square mean  ratios  and 95% confidence intervals  (95% CI ) for the P4M3 Gen  2.0: 
cigarettes ratio  and the ratios of variants of P4M3 Gen  2.0.

2.1 Background  
2.1.1  Smoking -Related Diseases and Harm Reduction Strategy  
Cigarette smoking causes pulmonary, cardiovascular and other serious diseases in smokers [3]. 
There is no safe cigarette, and the best way for smokers to reduce the adverse health 
consequences of smoking is to quit. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_349137], some 
smokers decide to continue smoking. The development of novel tobacco and nicotine 
containing products with the potential to be less harmful than cigarettes represents an approach 
to reduce cigarette -related deaths and diseases among smokers who would have otherwise 
continued smoking [4]. Philip Morris Products S.A. (PMP) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_610385]. These products aim to  substantially reduce or eliminate the exposure to 
harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs)  generated from cigarette  smoke , with 
the exception of nicotine, while providing an acceptable substitute for cigarettes.  
One of these products is P4M3 G en 2.0, which is an electronic nicotine delivery system 
(ENDS)  or electronic cigarette  (e-cigarette) . The liquid  used in P4M3 Gen  2.[ADDRESS_809277] the potential to benefit adult smokers who are not pregnant if used as a 
complete substitute for combustible tobacco containing products such as  cigarettes. However,  
in some particular conditions of  e-cigarettes use, harm has been recentl y reported . In a recent 
investigation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have analyzed national 
data on e -cigarette, or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], product use -associated lung injury. CDC and FDA recommend 
that people should not use Tetrahydrocannabinol (TH C)-containing e -cigarette, or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
products, particularly from informal sources like friends, family, or in -person or online sellers. 
Vitamin E acetate should not be added to e -cigarette, or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], products, or any other 
substances not intended by [CONTACT_3455].  
CDC, FDA, and state health authorities have made progress in identifying substances of 
concern in e-cigarettes or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_96612] . However, there are many different substances and 
product sources that remain under investigation, and there ma y be more than one cause.  
Given that context, when developi[INVESTIGATOR_610386] s such as P4M3 Gen  2.0, appropriate 
assessment including comprehensive understanding o f product characterization , its safety,  and 
related impact of product use in human s is critical . P4M3 Gen  2.0 is a close d e-cigarette  with 
a Cartridge that cannot  be refilled and for which  the e-liquid does not contain THC or Vitamin 
E acetate  (section 2.1.2 ). 
Philip Morris Products SA  Clinical  Study Protocol  Confidential  
P4-PK-04-US Final  Page [ADDRESS_809278] and Scientific Findings  
P4M3 Gen  2.0 is an Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS ) that produces an aerosol 
through vaporization of an e -liquid. The e -liquid i s composed of propylene glycol (PG), 
vegetable glycerol (VG), water, nicotine, lactic acid, benzoic acid and flavors . P4M3 Gen  2.0 
is a closed e -cigarette composed of a Battery unit containing all the electronics with a 
rechargeable battery and a disposabl e, replaceable Cartridge containing the e -liquid and the 
heating element. The P4M3 Gen  2.0 Cartridge is not refillable.  
The aerosol production (heating cycle) is trigg ered by a pressure sensor in the Battery unit 
when a puff is detected. The e -liquid aeros ol is produced by a heater of a fine mesh  of stainless -
steel wires heated by [CONTACT_610411].  
The aerosol generated by P4M3 Gen  2.0 is free from the majority of HPHCs associated with 
heating or burning tobacco, except nicotine. P4M3 Gen  2.0 does not contain tobacco and there 
is no combustion during use.  
The non -clinical assessment is d escribed in the Investigator’s B rochure and supports the 
clinical assessment of P4M3 Gen  2.0 [5]. P4M3 Gen  2.0 has n ot been tested in humans before.  
In 2016, FDA finalized a rule extending its Center for Tobacco products’ (CTP's) regulatory 
authority to cover all tobacco products, including  ENDS that meet the definition of a tobacco 
product. FDA regulates the manufactur e, import, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, 
sale, and distribution of ENDS, including components and parts of ENDS.  
When assessing ENDS use, significant inter -subject variability has been described for human 
puffing topography (HPT) parameters,  especially puff duration, puff frequency, and flow rate 
[6]. Experienced e -cigarette users may extract more nicotine by [CONTACT_610412] a low flow rate 
and long duration puffs in comparison to cigarette smokers. E -cigarette design features also 
affect nicotine exposure; increasing the battery voltage output and e -liquid nicotine 
conce ntration increases the nicotine delivery [7]. Differences in puffing behavior (such as puff 
duration or depth of inhalation) resulted in a faster absorption rate and a higher amount of 
nicotine absorption in experienced e -cigarette users as compared to naïve e -cigarette users 
when using the same e -cigarette  [8]. Battery output, type of wicks, ventilation holes, and other 
mechanical characteristics of each individual e -cigarette product determine how much aerosol 
and nicotine is released. More effective and appealing e -cigarette products to provide satisfying 
alternatives to smoking has led to e -liquids containing ‘nicotine salts’. Nicotine salts are 
formed by [CONTACT_610413] a suitable acid and are less volatile than freebase 
nicotine [9]. As a result, a greater fraction of the nicotine in the salt form is expecte d to remain 
in inhaled aerosol droplets until the aerosol reaches the alveoli for pulmonary absorption.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles of  2 
variants of P4M3 Gen  2.0 versus cigarettes  following a 6 minute s ad libitum  use period. In 
addition, pharmacodynamic effects  (PD), including subjective effects and related behavioral 
assessments , as well as human puffing topography  (HPT)  will be evaluated, to provide further 
insights on P4M3 Gen [ADDRESS_809279] use. Safety will be assessed 
throughout the study.  
The aim is to evaluate if P4M3 Gen  2.0 can provide an acceptable alternative to smoking 
cigarettes in term s of both , nicotine delivery and sensorial  satisfaction for smoke rs who would 
otherwise continue smoking cigarettes.  
2.3 Anticipated Benefits and Risks  
2.3.1  Anticipated Benefits  
Information on health risks associated with smoking and smoking cessation advice will be 
provided. Subjects who are motivated to quit smoking or using other nicotine/tobacco -
containing products  during the study will be given the opportunity to continue their smoking 
cessation attempt and will be referred to appropriate stop smoking services for continuing 
support and counselling at a higher level. Subjec ts who participate in this study will also benefit 
from repeated and detailed health check -ups.  
2.3.2  Anticipated Foreseeable Risks due to Study Procedures  
The risk of scheduled procedures in the present study (e.g., blood samples) are deemed to be 
on par with procedures routinely performed during normal or extended health examinations by 
[CONTACT_423]’s healthcare professional. The total volume of blood to be drawn is approximately 
[ADDRESS_809280] blood donation. The risks related to blood 
sampling include for example: excessive bleeding, fainting, hematoma, paresthesia or 
infection, and those related to the total amount of blood taken over a period of time such as 
weakness, dizziness or anemia.  
2.3.[ADDRESS_809281], it has not yet been demonstrated that P4M3 Gen  2.0 or other 
e-cigarettes reduce the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_60115] -related diseases compared to cigarettes.

commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby [CONTACT_610400]. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . Due to sensorial and technological differences between P4M3 Gen  2.0 and cigarettes, it is 
possible that subjects will adapt their behavior, e.g., by [CONTACT_610414], the volume 
and/or duration of puffs, as well as the intensity of inhalation.  
The confinement setting may also have an i nfluence on puffing behavior and nicotine uptake . 
An adult smoker using P4M3 Gen  2.0 may experience:  
• Transient nicotine withdrawal symptoms (e.g., urge to smoke, irritability, anxiety 
feelings, restlessness, and difficulty to concentrate) similar to cravin gs observed during 
smoking cessation  
• Transient symptoms suggesting mild nicotine overdose such as stimulatory effects on 
sympathetic tone (increased blood pressure, increased heart rate), central nervous 
system (tremor, blunting of emotions, and decreased ability to concentrate), gastric acid 
secretion, and vomiting. Individuals who experience adverse events (AEs) (suggesting 
excessive stimulant effects) should be instructed to reduce their intensity of product use 
by [CONTACT_610415]/or t he intensity of puffing  
• Change in smoking habits due to study requirements and related concomitant 
symptoms, e.g., craving  
Support during periods of abstinence from any tobacco and nicotine containing products  will 
be provided.  
Further risk mitigation will  include:  
• Using commonly accepted research and scientific standards (e.g., blood samples not to 
exceed blood donation standards)  
• Medical supervision of all study subjects with follow -up of those who have experienced 
AEs/ serious adverse events (SAEs)  
2.3.4  Unfo reseeable Risks  
The possibility of unforeseeable events/risks will be explained in detail to study subjects.

4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a single -center, randomized, controlled, open -label , cross -over study in healthy subjects 
to investigate the nicotine pharmacokinetic profiles of two variants of P4M3 Gen  2.0 an 
electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) , compared to cigarettes. In addition, PD effects 
(subjective effects and related behavioral assessments) will be evaluated to  provide further 
insights on product evaluation.  The study will be conducted with 3 periods and  in a 6 sequence -
cross -over design.  
A Screening Visit will be conducted within 28 days (Day -29 to Day -2) prior to Admission 
(Day -1) to the investigational site ( Figure 2). A demonstration of P4M3 Gen  2.0, without 
product use, will be done by [CONTACT_610417] . A 
sufficient number of subjects will be screened to ensure that [ADDRESS_809285] using P4M3 Gen  2.0 Classic Auburn 
3.5% (CA35) variant ad libitum  for up to [ADDRESS_809286], subjects not willing 
and/or not ready to use P4M3 Gen  2.[ADDRESS_809287] will start their confinement period of 3 days.  The brand of subjects’ cigarettes will be 
recorded.   
[ADDRESS_809288] use  on Day 1 to Day 3  
(see Figure 2). 
On Day [ADDRESS_809289] 1 2 hours of abstinence from any nicotine/tobacco containing 
products (nicotine wash -out), subjects will smoke a cigarette  or use a variant of P4M3 
according  to randomized product use sequence ad libitum for 6 minutes  (± 30 seconds) . The 
weight of each  P4M3 Gen  2.[ADDRESS_809290]  puffing topography 
device connected with data recording ad libitum  for 6 minutes  (± 30 seconds) .  
Subjects will complete questionnaires about product evaluation, craving and liking 
assessments.  
The start of product use of the 6 minutes ad libitum  use period will be defined as T 0. T0 on Day 
1 to Day 3 should be at approximately the same time in the mor ning, within a window of ± [ADDRESS_809291] operating

during which AE/SAEs reported by [CONTACT_610403] -up of 
AEs/SAEs  ongoing at d ischarge  will be conducted by [CONTACT_2727]  (section  8.2.6 ).  
Subjects who will be discontinued from the study before enrolment will be replaced. After 
enrollment but before randomization, subjects who will be discontinued from the study will 
enter the 3 -day Safety Follow -Up Period and will be replaced. However, subjects that are 
discontinued after randomization will not be replaced . 
4.2 Rationale for Study Desi gn  
The minimum age of 2 4 years old in the inclusion criteria was selected based on the legal age 
of smoking in the [LOCATION_002] of Ameri ca of 21 years; and to account for the 3 years of 
smoking history.  
The goal of this study is to evaluate  the nicotine absorption profile s and related PK parameters  
from two variants P4M3 Gen  2.0 (CA35 and CM35)  with 3.5% nicotine compared  to 
cigarettes.  
The 6 minutes ad libitum  use allow appropriate comparisons  between  different products and 
smoking a cigarette  similar to  published data  [10-13]. The ad libitum  use will also allow to 
explore effects of product liking on PK parameters.   
Sampling time points  for determination of nicotine concentrations were selected to ensure 
reliable estimation of PK parameters. In particular, frequent sampling during the first 15 
minu tes from T 0 will be performed in order to reliably assess Tmax, which is expected to be 
comparable  to what was observed previously (Tmax range: 7 to 10 minutes  after fixed puffing 
regimen ) with P4M3 Gen 1.0, an earlier developmental version  [5] and for cigarettes (Tmax 
range: ~10 minutes)  [14] and which is compatible with absorption by [CONTACT_610418].  
Comparing  early AUC values AUC 0-2min, AUC 0-4min, AUC 0-Tmax, and the maximum ratio 
max(Ct/t)t∈]0,Tmax] of the 2 variants P4M3 Gen  2.0 and cigarettes may provide insight into the 
efficiency of nicotine absorption  rate into the blood .

Data and information contained in this document are considered to constitute trade secrets and confidential 
commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby [CONTACT_610400]. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . The PK of p lasma nicotine presents a biphasic profile, with a typi[INVESTIGATOR_610387]-life (t 1/2α) of 1.35  hours,  followed by a slower terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2z) of hours 
[15]. To ensure a complete  nicotine washout between each product use, [ADDRESS_809295]  
use (cigarette or P4M3 Gen  2.0) would have been required (~ 5 x terminal elimination t 1/2z). 
Based on nicotine population PK modeling, it was estimated that nicotine enters  in the terminal 
elimination phase with concentrations decreasing with a terminal eli mination rate constant (λ z) 
[ADDRESS_809296] for carry -over 
effects with adjustment of baseline values to the estimated t 1/2z (or λ z) which will be derived 
from additional blood sampling on Day [ADDRESS_809297].  
The use of estrogen contraceptive is known to accelerate nicotine clearance by 20% to 30% 
compared to women who do not take estrogen contraceptive [16]. Therefore, for the purpose 
of this study, use of hormonal contraception c ontaining estrogens is prohibited. This also 
applies to hormone replacement therapy.  
The activity of CYP2A6 will be measured as this enzyme  drives the metabolism of nicotine 
into cotinine and subsequent metabolites. Nicotine metabolism by [CONTACT_097]2A6 varies be tween 
individuals of the same ethnicity/race and across ethnicity/race due to genetic variations. These 
genetic differences could be associated with reduced/increased nicotine metabolism [14]. 
4.3 Appropriateness of Measurements  
All laboratory measures utilized for this study are validated and are appropriate for the study 
assessments. FTND [17, 18] and ABOUT -Product experience  questionnaires  [19] used in this 
study are validated and previously published or adapted versions of validated questionnaires.

to 28 days prior to Admission (Day -29 to Day -2), 3 days of confinement (after enrol lment on 
Day -1 to time of discharge on Day 3, 3 overnight s tays), and a 3 -day Safety Follow -Up (from 
time of Discharge at Day 3 until Day 6). The end of the study (EOS) for a subject is defined as 
either the Discharge at Day 3, or the date of early termination of the subject, plus [ADDRESS_809299] 40% of the total randomized subjects .

A subject can only be discontinued from the study after enrollment.  
Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. Subjects 
will be questioned for the reason for withdrawal from the study, although they are not obliged 
to disclose it. If a subject withdraws from the study, he/she will be asked to confirm that he/she 
agrees to undertake the early termination procedures for safety assessments, and this 
information will be fully documented by [CONTACT_737].

prior to withdrawal will be analyzed, unless the subject disagrees in writing.  
When a subject is discontinued from the study, all early terminati on procedures (section  9.7) 
will be performed unless the subject refuses to perform the assessments  or the procedures have 
already been performed during the study day . Early termination procedures are to be performed 
only for subje cts who have been exposed to P4M3 Gen  2.0. After the date of termination, t he 
subject will enter into the 3-day Safety Follow -Up Period. This applies to all subjects 
independent of the reason of discontinuation (for example, withdrawal of cons ent, or at the 
Investigator’s decision , etc.). 
Subjects must be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent.  
• Any AE/SAE or condition (including clinically significant changes in a laboratory 
parameter), whi ch at the discretion of the Investigator is not compatible  with the 
subject’s continued participation in this study.  
• Positive pregnancy test (sectio n 8.5). 
• The Sponsor the study . If the Sponsor decides to prematurely terminate the study, the 
subject will be promptly informed  by [CONTACT_737] . The Investigator  should report

P4M3 Gen 2.0 is  an ENDS or electronic cigarette (e -cigarette) , which produces an aerosol 
through vaporization of an e -liquid. P4M3 Gen 2.0  is composed of a Battery unit  containing  
all the  control electronics with the rechargeable battery and a disposable Cartridge  containing 
the e -liquid and the heating element.  The Battery unit comp rises several functions. The device 
provides  electrical power  when required,  which is  activated  by [CONTACT_610423] . The device has 
a “dry mesh detection ” function to prevent overheating w hen the liquid on heater is not 
sufficient .  
The Battery unit is charged  via a USB port. The Battery unit also features a tactile function 
that will operate when the unit is turned on and off and when a puff is taken.  
The Battery unit is controlled through  a single multi -function button used for switching on and 
off and allowing the modification of both the haptic (vibration) and the power level.  
The Cartridge consists of a reservoir for storing the e -liquid, which also acts as the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_610388] t he air flow channels to carry the aerosol from the heater to the user. The Cartridge 
contains the e -liquid, the mesh heater sub -assembly and the porous materials for liquid 
retention and transport from the reservoir to the heater. The Cartridge is disposed  of when the 
e-liquid in the reservoir is depleted.  
The P4M3 Gen 2.0 e -liquid formulation s are composed of propylene glycol ( PG), vegeta ble 
glyce rin (VG), water, tobacco -derived nicotine, lactic acid , benzoic acid and could differ in 
flavors  and nicotine concentrations . The following P4M3 Gen 2.0 e -liquid formulations 
(variants) will be investigated  in this study (Table 1).

7.7.[ADDRESS_809340] operating procedures (SOPs) at the investigational site.  
Since the test for nicotine concentration is highly sensitive, precautions should be taken during 
blood sampling and processing to prevent the contamination of samples with environmental 
nicotine.  
In total, approximately  300 mL of blood will be collected for this study including samples for 
determination of plasma  nicotine concentrations ( approximately 230 mL), CYP2A6 activity ( 5 
mL), serology (5  mL) and safety laboratory (approximately 6 0 mL). This calculation is based 
on an individ ual volume of each sample of 5.[ADDRESS_809341] blood donation.   
Details on the  procedures for collection, labeling, handling and shipment of samples are

Schedule of events . Data will be not be collected during cigarette smoking . 
The P4M3 Gen 2.0 device is equipped with a pressure sensor, which measures the pressure at 
the Cartridge level. When a puff is drawn, the P4M3 Gen 2.0 calculates the difference  of 
pressure between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure measured at the Cartridge level. 
The aerosol production (heating cycle) is then triggered based on the difference of pressure 
values calculated by [CONTACT_8121]. The MDEDR puffing topography devic e is mechanically

8.1 Definition s 
8.1.1  Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any health -related event which is adverse or unfavorable 
and which either starts after ICF signature [CONTACT_610462] a worsening of a health –related 
condition that existed at the time of that signature. Careful medical judgment is required to 
establish wh ether a clinical finding (including an abnormal laboratory result) is a true AE or 
just a manifestation of a preexisting health –related condition. An AE may or may not have a 
causal relationship with the study procedures or with the use of investigational product.  
8.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that:  
• results in death,  
• is life -threatening,  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity,  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
• is an important medical event  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based on appropriate Investigator’s me dical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or the subject may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definitions.  
"Life -threatening" means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the ev ent. It 
might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form.  
8.1.3  Conditions Existent Before the Start of the Period of Collection (ICF 
Signature)  
Clinical conditions that existed before the start of the period of collection of AEs and are still 
ongoing at Screening (concomitant disease), and whose severity remained unchanged after that 
point, should not be considered AEs and should not be captured as such. This includes medical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_610397] e the start of the period of

without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . collection regardless of involving admissions to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], if the medical condition to be 
addressed did not get worse after the start of the collection period. Otherwise, any medical 
condition that existed before the start of t he period of collection and still ongoing at Screening 
(concomitant disease) and whose severity increased after that point is to be captured as an AE 
or SAE, depending on the seriousness criteria met.  
8.[ADDRESS_809349] by [CONTACT_610434], open, non -directive questions from the investigator(s) or designee(s) (e.g., “How 
have you been feeling since you were last asked?”).  
Any no n-serious AE occurrence during the study must be documented in the subject’s medical 
records in accordance with the Investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the AE page of 
the CRF. SAEs that occur during the study must be documented in the subject’s medical record, 
on the AE CRF, and on the SAE form.  
Information recorded will include: verbatim description of the AE/SAE , start and stop dates 
and times,  seriousness, severity (intensity), action taken ( e.g., whether or not the AE/SAE led 
to the subject’ s discontinuation from the study), and outcome ( e.g., resolved, stabilized ,).  
Information to be recorded about an AE/SAE should include, whenever possible, onset and 
resolution dates and times, circumstances leading up to the event, clinical elements such  as 
clinical course, specific vital signs and test results that may explain the pathophysiology of the 
event, as well as alternative explanations to its occurrence.  
Whenever a medically meaningful diagnosis is available to comprise a set of reported signs  
and/or symptoms, it should be preferentially provided as the AE or SAE term, rather than the 
individual signs and/or symptoms. Otherwise, each one of those signs and/or symptoms should 
be reported separately as event terms.  
8.2.2  Period of Collection  
AEs (inclu ding SAEs) will be collected from the time of ICF signature [CONTACT_610463] . 
Any AEs which occur during the screening period will be captured by [CONTACT_610435](s) in  order to establish relationship to study 
procedures.  
During a 3-day Safety Follow -Up Period new AEs/SAEs will be recorded and ongoing 
AEs/SAEs will be followed -up by [CONTACT_3452]. In general, AEs will be followed -up until

has been found and until the end of the study  or subject is lost to follow up . Any AEs or SAEs 
that are ongoing at the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period will be managed as described in 
section 8.2.[ADDRESS_809350] assess the intensity of each reported AE according to the following 
grading scale:  
Table 4 Intensity of Adverse Events  
Mild: Easily tolerated, not interfering with normal everyday activities  
Moderate : Interferes with normal everyday activities, but the subject is still able to 
function  
Severe : Incapacitating and requiring medical intervention  
8.2.[ADDRESS_809351] assess the causal relationship between the exposure to the IP (P4M3 Gen  
2.0 and cigarettes)  and each of the reported AEs, using the classification system and the criteria 
described below. The same assessment must be made separately to assess the causal 
relationship between the study procedures and each of the reported AEs:  
Not related : The temp oral relationship of the adverse event to IP administration or study 
procedure(s) makes a causal relationship unlikely, or concomitant medication, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.  
Related : The temporal relationship of the adverse event to IP or study procedure(s) 
makes a causal relationship possible, and concomitant medication, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation 
for the obser ved event.  
8.2.5  Expectedness  
Any AE assessed as related to the IP  (P4M 3 Gen 2.0 or cigarettes)  will be assessed for its 
expectedness. An AE will be regarded as “unexpected” if its nature or severity is not consistent 
with information already recorded in sectio n 6.5 of the current Investigator’s Brochure  [5].

without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . 8.2.6  Follow -up of Non -serious and Serious Adverse Events  
Any non -serious AE that is ongoing at the time of Discharge or early termination will be 
followed -up by [CONTACT_610436] -Up Period until it has been resolved, 
stabilized (i.e., no worsening of the condition), or an acceptable expla nation has been found 
(e.g., a chronic condition). The follow -up of the ongoing non -serious AEs will be done via a 
phone call performed at the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period.  If the subject is not responding 
at the first phone call additional two attem pts will be made, then subject will be declared lost 
to follow -up.  
At the end of the 3-day Safety FU Period, all ongoing non -serious AEs will have the outcome 
documented as “unknown” and will not be followed -up by [CONTACT_737]. At the discretion 
of th e Investigator, the subject will be referred to his General Practitioner to have his/her 
ongoing AEs addressed accordingly.  
All SAEs will be followed up by [CONTACT_610437] -
Up Period, until their resolution, s tabilization (i.e., no worsening of the condition), or an 
acceptable explanation has been found (e.g., a chronic condition).  In case the subject cannot 
be reached for additional information related to SAE(s), a total [ADDRESS_809352] awareness to Sponsor , via email, having the SAE form attached  as detailed in the 
Safety Management Plan (SMP) . 
As further information regarding an already reported SAE becomes available to any of the 
parties involved in this study, such follow -up information should be reported on a new SAE 
report form, marked as a follow -up report and submitted to Sponsor according  to the same 
timelines as described above. The follow -up SAE report form must include the minimum 
information required for form completion and only changed/new information needs to be 
specified. Information provided in the follow -up SAE report form superse des any information 
that was initially reported.  
The SAE report form to be used in this study is provided as a separate document. All SAEs 
will also be recorded on the relevant CRF page, in addition to the SAE report form.  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for submitting the relevant reports of SAEs that 
occur during the study to the IRB, according to local regulations and in accordance with the 
respective safety management plan (SMP).  
Philip Morris Products SA  Clinical  Study Protocol  Confidential  
P4-PK-04-US Final  Page [ADDRESS_809353] be assessed using Common Terminology 
Criteria  for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 5.0 grading scales ( Appendix C). Whenever that 
grading  scheme is not available for the laboratory result of concern, the Investigator should 
assess the severity and the clinical significance of that result using his/her medical judgment.  
Abnormal laboratory test results detected at the Screening Visit whose C TCAE grades are [ADDRESS_809354] be recorded accordingly.  
However, in some instances, they may be assessed as AEs (and therefore mus t be handled as 
described  in section  8.2) or as manifestations of already reported AEs. This decision will 
require a careful assessment of the abnormal result within the clinical context on a case -by-
case basis and will depend on the  Investigator's medical judgment.  
Abnormal laboratory test results detected after the Screening Visit whose CTCAE grades are 
[ADDRESS_809355] either be 
recorded as AEs (and handled as described  in section  8.2) or linked to a concomitant disease 
or to an already reported AE.  
The principles for assessing and reporting abnormal laboratory test r esults, emerging after the 
Screening Visit, using CTCAE 5.0 grading scales are set up in Table 5: 
Table [ADDRESS_809356] Results  
Grading  Clinically significant?  Is it a grade increase 
from previous results 
in study?  Report?  
Grade 1  No Not applicable  No 
Grade 1  Yes No No* 
Grade 1  Yes Yes Yes, as AE or linked to 
an already reported AE  
Grade 2 or higher  No/Yes  No No* 
Grade 2 or higher  No/Yes  Yes Yes, as AE or linked to 
an already reported AE   
* in this situation, this abnormal lab test result is either a manifestation of a concomitant disease or of an already 
reported AE.

In general, laboratory values will be recorded as “increased <lab parameter>” or “decreased 
<lab parameter>” to ensure consistency of recording/coding.   
8.4.2  Reporting other abnormal findings  
The other abnormal findings discovered during different clinical ass essments (e.g., ECG, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], physical examination, vital signs, body weight)  should be evaluated for clinical 
significance by [CONTACT_737]/designee based on his/her medical judgement. All abnormal 
clinically significant test results or clinical exa mination findings should be reported as AEs 
and handled as described in  section  8.2. 
8.5 Reporting and Follow –Up of Pregnancies  
8.5.[ADDRESS_809357] will 
be discontinued, and reported as “enrolled but not randomized” subject. Early termination 
procedures shall apply. No pregnancy form will be filled.  
Any pregnancy detected after randomization must be reported by [CONTACT_13658] [ADDRESS_809358]. A dedicated pregnancy form will be used to report reportable cases 
of pregnancy . 
 
Any pregnancy that was potentially associated with exposure to IP (P4M3 Gen 2.0  or cigarette) 
will be followed -up until an outcome is reached (e.g., normal delivery, spontaneous abortion, 
or voluntary termination) and also until [ADDRESS_809359]  pregnancy reports and 
provide any additional/follow -up information to Sponsor.

The Investigator is responsible for informing the responsible IRB  of any pregnancy case that 
was reported during the study, as determined by [CONTACT_427].  
8.6 Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation  
Subjects who are discontinued from the study because of an AE will undergo the early 
termination procedures (section 9.7), as soon as practical after discontinuation and will enter 
the 3-day Safety Follow -Up Period. In general, AEs will be followed -up until resolved, 
stabilized (i.e., no worsening of the event), or a plausible explanation has been found and until 
the end of the study.  
Any AEs or SAEs that are ongoing at the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period will be managed 
as described in section 8.2.[ADDRESS_809360]  events, affecting P4M3 Gen  2.0 Battery unit and /or 
P4M3 Gen  2.0 Cartridge, including malfunction or misuse (use not in accordance with its 
instruction) by a subject will be documented by [CONTACT_737] . Information regarding P4M3 
Gen 2.[ADDRESS_809361] events should be actively collected during the study and assessed for severity 
as Minor or Major:  
Minor  – Can be resolved easily.  
Major  – Cannot  be resolved.  
P4M3 Gen  2.[ADDRESS_809362] events will be categorized into: Break, Fluid Leak, Intermittent Loss of 
Power, Power Problem, Premature Indicator Activation or Other.  
Investigational product misuse may result in use -related hazards (section  2.3.4). 
Furthermore, any malfunction or misuse of P4M3 Gen  2.0 that leads to an AE/SAE will follow 
the same processes as described above.

In general, if no start time for the procedures is provided, then the procedure can be performed 
at any tim e during the day.  
The main  objective for this study is the evaluation of the plasma concentration -time profile of 
nicotine and derived PK parameters. Therefore, the collection of blood samples for 
determination of plasma nicotine concentration should be as  close to the schedule time as 
possible and should take precedence over any other assessments  required at the same time.  
9.1 Screening Visit (Day -29 to Day -2) 
The Screening Visit will be performed within 28 days prior to enrollment at Admission (Day 
-1). Fir st, the ICF along with study information should be given to the subject. Prior to being 
asked to sign the consent form, subjects will be given time to review the study information and 
ask any questions. When/if the ICF is signed, dated and timed, the other  screening procedures 
can be performed in the order deemed most practical. While it is recommended to complete as 
many screening procedures as possible in one day, it is permissible to complete those over 
more than one day. Smoking is allowed at the Screen ing Visit at the discretion of the 
investigational site.

(CRO) not involved with the study site w ill be responsible for the monitoring of the study. 
Monitoring will be performed according to the CRO’s SOPs and as per the agreed monitoring 
plan with the Sponsor.  
Before the first subject is screened and included in the study, an Investigator meeting/sit e 
initiation visit will be conducted. During this meeting/visit, the general training of the study 
procedures and specific training on selected procedures will be performed and documented . 
All activities to be conducted will be described in the monitoring plan.  
During the study, the Monitor will have regular contact [CONTACT_375047], including 
routine monitoring visits. The frequency and purpose of the monitoring visits will be defined 
in the monitoring plan agreed with the Sponsor.  
The Inves tigator or designee shall permit the Monitor to review study data as frequently as 
deemed necessary to ensure that data are being recorded in an adequate manner and that 
protocol adherence is satisfactory.  
The Investigator or designee shall access medical  records for the Monitor so that entries in the 
CRFs may be verified. The Investigator or designee, as part of their responsibilities, is expected 
to ensure that the study adheres to GCP requirements.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investi gator’s staff, must be available during 
the monitoring visit to review the data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access to the 
subject’s records for source data verification.  
The Monitor and the Sponsor’s personnel will be available between visi ts, should the 
Investigator or other staff at the investigational site need information and/or advice.  
Communication by [CONTACT_756], mail and e -mail may be used as needed to supplement 
investigational site visits. The Investigator and study personnel will c ooperate with the 
Monitor, provide all appropriate documentation and will be available to discuss the study.

All data management activities will be described in detail in the data management plan (DMP) 
and documents specified therein.  
11.1 Data Capture  
11.1.1  Case Report Forms and Study Records  
CRFs are produced  by [CONTACT_610441] (DM -CRO) , 
stored electronically, and are available to the designated study team members. Each CRF is 
reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_737] . The final signed CRFs are provided to the Sponsor in 
the format as decided upon between DM-CRO  and the Sponsor (e.g., CD, flash drive , SFTP). 
This w ill be documented in the DMP). The subject questionnaires will be completed directly 
by [CONTACT_423]. Trained study personnel will be responsible for capturing the data from the 
observations, tests, and assessments specified in the pr otocol in the source documents and DM-
CRO  will enter the data into the CRF, in accordance with the CRF Completion Guidelines.  
The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all data related 
to the clinical study and ensur ing that the data are accurate, authentic/original, legible, timely 
(contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRF must be signed by [CONTACT_610442]. Any correction 
made  to source documents must be clearly recorded, without obscuring the original values and 
be accompanied by [CONTACT_349224], reason for change, and identification of the person 
making the change. The CRF for each subject will be checked against the sourc e documents at 
the investigational site by [CONTACT_35717]. Instances of missing or unclear data will be discussed 
with the Investigator for resolution. A CRF will be generated for all subjects that sign the ICF.  
11.1.2  Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations are def ined as any departure from the procedures defined in this document, 
including, but not limited to, any violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, mis -randomization, 
use of any nicotine or tobacco -containing product other than the assigned product during th e 
exposure period, assessments not performed or performed outside the scheduled time windows, 
or use of medications that are known to affect study endpoints.  
Protocol deviations will be entered into the clinical trial management system (CTMS) or other 
approved format. The data collected in the CRF may be used to assess protocol deviations from 
the data programmatically. Protocol deviations will be reconciled and categorized prior to 
locking the clinical database as described in the DMP .

12.1 General Considerations  
Full det ails of the statistical analysis will be given in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). The 
following statistical analyses will not be performed prior to the finalization of the SAP. Any 
changes to the planned statistical methods from the SAP will be docume nted in the clinical 
study report ( CSR ). The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS®, version 9.[ADDRESS_809395] 40% of each sex, therefore analyses will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_4321], as well as unstratified,  as detailed in the SAP.

P4-PK-04-US Final  Page [ADDRESS_809398] and sequence, and 
overall.  
12.1.4  Handling of Missing Values and of Values outside the Detection Limits  
In general, missing data will not be imputed  in this study, due to the nature of the measurements 
and the short periods of exposure and use. However, for questionnaire data , total scores and 
domain or subscale scores may use a certain degree of imputation by [CONTACT_610443]. Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
In general, bioanalytical values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be 
imputed using 0.5 x lower limit of quantification. For values above the upper limit of 
quantification (ULOQ), the ULOQ  will be used for calculation and reporting in summary 
tables.   
For nicotine concentrations below the LLOQ (BLOQ):  
• BLOQ values before T0 will be imputed by [CONTACT_311575]/2.  
• BLOQ values after the last quantifiable value are not included in the analysis (e.g., for 
the cal culation of AUC).  
• Any BLOQ value (after T0 and before the last quantifiable value) would need to be 
queried and, if confirmed, it will be imputed by [CONTACT_311575]/2.   
The number and percent of values below LLOQ or above ULOQ will be presented in each 
summary table.

without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . 12.2.1  Assumptions  
The precision has been determined using the following geometric mean (GM), geometric 
coefficient of variation (GCV) and within subjects correlation assumptions for C max: 
• For all products the GCV is 80% ( in previous study [5] GCV is in the range of 0.63 to 
0.83)  
• For usual brand of cigarettes, the GM is 12  ng/mL  (in previous studies  [32-34] this GM 
is in the range of 11 to 13)  
• For P4M3 Gen  2.0 variants with 3.5% nicotine , the GM is 11  ng/mL  (in previous a 
previous study [5] GM is in the range of 9.4 to 12)  
• The correlation within subjects on log -transformed data is 0.8 (in previous studies [32-
34] this correlation is in the range of 0.82 to 0.88)  
12.2.2  Method  
The analysis of confidence interval precision on the P4M3 Gen  2.0: cigarettes Cmax ratios has 
been implemented using SAS, simulating [ADDRESS_809400] exposure.  
The P4M3 Gen  2.0:cigarettes Cmax ratios and related confidence intervals have been 
determined by [CONTACT_610444] P4M3 Gen  2.0 variants and

correction will be implem ented by [CONTACT_610445]. 
The nicotine terminal  elimination rate constant λz (and terminal elimination half -life t1/2z) 
will be estimated from the Day 2 PK samples  (section 7.5.1 ) by [CONTACT_2329]  a linear regression  on 
the log plasma nicotine concentration data. The regression analysis  should contain data from 
at least 3 different time points in the terminal phase (including the last quantifiable 
concentration but Cmax), consistent with the assessment of a straight line on the log -transformed 
scale. The nicotine plasma background -correc ted PK parameters will be derived by [CONTACT_610446].  
For the purposes of background -correction of the plasma c oncentrations pos t-baseline the 
followi ng formul a will be applied : C t = uCt - uC0 * e-λz·t. Where, C t is the corrected 
concentration  at each time point, uCt is the uncorrected concentration  at each time point, uC0 
is the pre -use baseline concentration, λ z is the Day 2 terminal elimination rate constant and t is 
the actual time  [35]. For the purposes of background -correction of the plasma c oncentrations 
post-baseline the followi ng formul a will be applied : C t = uCt - uC0 * e-λz·t. Where, C t is the 
corrected concentration  at each time point, uCt is the uncorrected concentration  at each time 
point, uC0 is the pre -use baseline concentration, λ z is the Day 2 terminal elimination rate 
constant and t is the actual time  [35].  
The procedure of the baseline adjustment will be detailed in the SAP.  
If plasma concentrations cannot be background -corrected in a sufficient number of subjects, 
alternative analysis methods will be used, as detailed in the SAP.  
In particular, the following PK parameters will be derived from nicotine levels adjusted for 
baseline:  
Cmax Maximum background -corrected plasma concentration. C max will be 
reported as long as there is at least one quantifiable concentration post T 0. 
Tmax Time to maximum background -corrected plasma nicotine concentration 
Cmax. 
AUC 0-2min  Area under the background -corrected plasma concentration -time curve 
from start of product use (T 0) to [ADDRESS_809404] quantifiable concentration . 
AUC 0-infinity  Area under the background -corrected plasma nicotine concentration -time 
curve extrapolated from T 0 to infinity . 
max(Ct/t)t∈]0,Tmax]  Maximum ratio of background -corrected concentration over time, from 
T0 (excluded) to T max (included)

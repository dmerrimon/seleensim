Background , Rationale  and Context  
.  
The successful implementation of the new AHA/ACC hypertension (HTN) guidelines based on 
the SPRINT trial findings will reduce risks posed by [CONTACT_795962]. Heart disease is 
the [LOCATION_002]’ leading cause of death.1,[ADDRESS_1097890] higher blood pressure (BP) and lower adoption rates of 
mobile health ( myHealth ) technologies. This is particularly prevalent  in African Americans, low 
literacy,  and older patients (our definition of “vulnerable” populations for this proposal).3-[ADDRESS_1097891] and widespread use: more than six billion people worldwide have 
access to mobile phones.8  
Medication non -adherence contributes to poor blood pressure control, which can lead to further 
cardiovascular complications including coronary heart disease and heart failure.3,7  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_795954].9 
Supporting adherence to medical regimens requires insight into patient’s medication -taking 
behavior and their reasons for non -adherence .3,[ADDRESS_1097892] we will use the Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ) because it has been well -
validated to identify ad herence among those with HTN, and scores correlate well with a range of 
objective adherence measures.11,12  compliance  
Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) appears to reduce BP in patients with HTN, but 
important questions remain regarding effective implementation and which groups may benefit 
most.13,14 In addition, non - with clinic appointments (“no shows”) is  a widespread health care 
problem and a missed opportunity for medication adjustment and BP control.[ADDRESS_1097893] the implementation in a 
population particularly affected by [CONTACT_105] - adherence and uncontrolled HTN. To engage patients in 
healthcare is considered a key strategy to improve patients' adherence, clinical outcomes, and 
satisfaction about care received.5,15,16  
 
Protocol version: 4.30.[ADDRESS_1097894] Health . Implementing a new text messaging service will improve the health delivery 
system in three ways. 1) Increasing patient engagement: SMS and HBPM  require s the patients 
to be highly involved and committed to improving their health and results in a marked improvement 
in the adherence to medication. BP measurements has also been reported to improve BP control. 
2) Supporting patients outside of the office  visits by [CONTACT_795963] (i.e. if patients are unable to get their prescriptions or are having significant 
side effects). 3) Adopting clinical guidelines to improve BP control in a vulnerable populati on. 
 
Specific Aims  
Given the high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension (HTN), testing novel interventions that 
support the implementation of hypertension guidelines may improve access, quality, and health 
outcomes . Although mobile health and text messaging shows promise in other health promotion 
settings, t he best strategy to support HTN management in minority non-adherent patients is still 
unknown . 13,[ADDRESS_1097895] an automated SMS intervention that can be disseminated and 
implemented to encourage adoption of hypertension guidelines by [CONTACT_795964].  
The rationale  for the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_795955]’ 
preferences and identifies barriers to adherence, is of critical importance in a learning health 
care system to transform health delivery, par ticularly for vulnerable populations. Minority 
populations are usually low adopters of mobile health tools and are most affected by 
[CONTACT_795965].4,6,17  
Aim 1 : Feasibility will be asses sed through examination of participant recruitment, retention and 
engagement. Specifically, we will look at the n umber of participants who refuse to participate in 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_795956]. Secondary 
impacts of interest include: medication adherence as measured by [CONTACT_96234] -item MA 
Questionnaire (MAQ) and change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 3 months.  
Aim 2:  To test the acceptability of a 3 -month SMS -based intervention in adults with uncont rolled 
hypertension. One cohort of 24 participants will be recruited for the SMS intervention. 
Acceptability will be assessed using the systems usability scale (a validated questionnaire that 
measures usability reliably in small samples)[ADDRESS_1097896] hypothesis  is that over 50% of contact[CONTACT_795966] 50% will check HBPM. This estimate is based on previous study by [CONTACT_795967]: 4.30.2020  
 4 colleagues in a similar patient population.3 Our second hypothesis will be that > 75% will be 
satisfied with the service (OK or above on the usability survey).9  
 
Methods and Measures  
 
Design  
A randomized control trial of  24 non-adherent participants will be monitor ed and followed for 3 
months;  An ambulatory BP arm device will be provided to  all participants  with printed 
instructions in English or Spanish  (from the American Heart Association) on how to measure BP 
at home (HBPM ). Patients will be instructed on checking their BP at least twice a week.14,[ADDRESS_1097897] uncontrolled HTN 
(SBP>130 or DBP >80 ) and have 2 or more BP medication(s)on their medication  list. 
Participants will be interviewed by [CONTACT_795968] a  MAQ score of 1 to 4 will be 
classified as non -adherent will be invited to participate. The study team member will assess the 
potential participant’s phone ownership, text messaging ability, text messaging willingness, and 
receptivity to the intervention (and record all this information).The MAQ cut -off was chosen for 
the study because it has been used in the literature in previous studies,20-22  and the cut -off at 
this value provides a highly sensitive tool for identifying  medication non -adherence. 22,23  
Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: intervention SMS arm or the control arm. 
If enrolled  in the intervention arm , the subjects will be contact[CONTACT_795969]. To ensure equal access to participation among women and minorities we will translate all 
materials and questions to Spanish. The privacy of potential subjects during recruitment will be 
protected by [CONTACT_795970] a private room during the interview 
process.   
As part of routine care, p atients who present to the office with u ncontrolled HTN receive 
instructions from their clinician on m edication changes and are advised to return for a nurse visit 
in 2 weeks and a clinician visit in 3 months. During follow -up, the nurse checks the patient’s 
blood pressure and contacts the clinician for further management if the BP is not controlled. 
Participants in the SMS arm will receive SMS message s to monitor their blood pressure i n 
addition to this routine care whereas the control arm will only receive the standard provider 
education and  monitoring for controlling blood pressure.  
Baseline demographic characteristics of the participants will be collected. Participants will be 
followed with office (or phone if they no show for their visit) interviews at 2 weeks or 3 months to 
complete 2 validated scales: the MAQ, and SUS+ free comments  
Study  intervention participants  will be provided with a  blood pressure monitor to be used for 
measurement and extraction of HBPM information. Clinicians will be alerted through an in -
basket message in the electronic medical record (Wake One) if the participants report BP 
outside the threshold range, and the patient will be sent an SMS and prompted to contact [CONTACT_795971]. The threshold range set for SBP is between 90 and180 mm Hg and between 60 and 110 
mm Hg for DBP for one -time measurements, These thresholds are  made based on the 
 
Protocol version: 4.30.2020  
 5 recommendations by [CONTACT_795972], which designate  a hypertensive urgency to be 180/110 
mm Hg or higher and hypotension 90/[ADDRESS_1097898] to 
document their discussion and route it to the patient’s PCP. Patients who refuse participation in 
the study will be asked for the reason and  their responses will be recorded to determine any 
barriers to participation.  Study team members will attempt to contact [CONTACT_795973] [ADDRESS_1097899] SBP>130 or DBP >[ADDRESS_1097900] BP medication(s) on their medication list.

Intervention s and Interactions  
 
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_795958] .  
 
Participants  in the SMS intervention arm will receive usual care and SMS texting  and phone 
calls. Study team members  will send secure SMS messages  to participants  weekly for four 
weeks and then every other week until the ir next appointment.  
 
Protocol version: 4.30.2020  
 6  The secure messaging system will  be as follows  
Introductory message:  
Welcome to managing your blood pressure with the Nephrology/ Internal medicine clinics at 
Wake Forest. Try to take your BP meds at the same time every day to keep your BP under 
control ! Make it part of your daily routine : 
First week  
Adherence checkpoint:  
1. Good morning! Did you take your blood pressure medications today?  
“No” Response:  
1. Let’s try to stay on top of taking them daily! You can do this!  
Additional prompts:  
Did you fill your prescription?  
-  -If no -> phone call to determine barrier to filling BP meds “Mr./Mrs. (X). My name 
[CONTACT_832] (Y), we met when you were in the 7th Janeway clinic.  I am calling you to find out if 
you are having difficulties filling your prescriptions. I will let Dr. (Name) know. Have you 
tried our pharmacy?” Message clinician in Wake One.  
-             If yes  
- Did you have any side effects from your blood pressure medication?  
-  -If yes -> phone call to determine side effects  
- Mr./Mrs. (X). My name [CONTACT_832] (Y), we met when you were in the 7th Janeway clinic.  I am 
calling you to find out if you are having side effects from your blood pressure 
medications . I will let Dr. (Name) know. Message clinician in Wake One.   
-           - If No, no action  
“Yes” Response:  
1. Keep it up! Plus thumbs up emoji  
 
Self-monitoring phase:  
1. Have you been checking your BP? We’ll be checking in tomorrow for results!  
“Yes” Response:  
1. Nice work!  
Additionally:  
What was the top number (SBP)?  
 What was the bottom number (DBP)?  
“No” Response:  
1. Never too late to start! Try checking your BP in the AM and PM every day for the next 
few days and we’ll check back again later.  
Data Response/Gamification:  
1. BP measurements received. You’re doing great! Keep it up – you’re currently in X place 
among texters.  
 
 
An adapted version of the System Usability Scale  (SUS)  by  [CONTACT_795974]9 will be administered either 
in person or the phone  after the follow up clinic visit  or at the end of week 12 (if patient misses 
follow up appointment) . 
 
Study team members will perform the following tasks to track study participants progress:  
 
Protocol version: 4.30.2020  
 7  
1. Weekly tracking of number of patients contact[CONTACT_795975], number of 
SMS questio ns answered, and number of office visits completed  
2. Monthly tracking of patient satisfaction surveys  
3. Monthly reports distributed via email to the team providing ongoing feedback on 
performance related to patient outreach and patient satisfaction   
4. When high or low BP is reported SBP > 180 or <90 and or DBP > 110 or <60, a study 
team member  will send a message in Wake One to the clinic triage nurses.  The triage 
nurse will contact [CONTACT_795976] a clinician office visit or a nur se blood pressure 
check appointment based on additional information on clinical symptoms.  
 
 
Outcome Measure(s)  
A- Feasibility  
Feasibility will be assessed consistent with the recommendations of Leon and colleagues.24  
Specifically, we will examine:  
1. Screening:  we will track the number of patients screened per month, the number 
enrolled per month, the proportion that are eligible who enroll.  
2. Recruitment : number of participants who refuse to participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_795959]. Proportion of vulnerable patients screened but 
excluded because they did not own a phone with SMS capability.  
3. Retention:  the proportion of participants who continue to use the m yHealth tool per 
month through three months will be tracked for the interventio n. 
4. Engagement : 12- SMS rate response of at least one home BP measurement. We will 
use  44% as our cut off based on an SMS study by [CONTACT_795977]25. 
Finally, we will monitor time needed for assessments and gather feedback on the participant 
burden.  
 
B-Acceptability  
Participants will complete the SUS in person on an I -Pad or over the phone. They will also be 
offered the opportunity to comment in their questionnaires about their experiences of taking part 
in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] . The SUS  yields a single score on a scale of 0 –100. A SUS score above a 68 would 
be considered above average . We will consider acceptable when >70 % of participants score 
the SUS above 68.[ADDRESS_1097901]  
Medication adherence  (MA)  will be measured by [CONTACT_795978] -item MAQ by [CONTACT_795979] [ADDRESS_1097902], S BP and DBP at 
enrollment and at 12 weeks follow up. The average change will be calculated and reported in 
mmHg.  
 
Protocol version: 4.30.2020  
 8 No-show rate at 3 months’  follow -up (f/u) clinic visits. If participants fail to come to their f/u visits 
within 7 days of their scheduled follo w-up appointment, they will be considered as “no - shows”. 
Our current clinic no -show rate is 30%, therefore if the study participants no -show rate is less 
than 30% we will consider our tool a feasible intervention.  
 
Analytical Plan  
Results will be analyzed  initially  using descriptive statistics.  Comparison between groups will be 
done using chi square tests for proportions, and t -tests for continuous variables.  Regression 
analysis will be performed to identify independent outcome predictors.  RedCap will be utilized to 
collect all patient data.  Participant’s demographics (including education level), co -morbidities, 
number of medications, number of blood pressure medications and BP numbers will be 
extracted from Wake One when availa ble. Level of education will be confirmed verbally with 
each participant during consent process. Only one participant identifier will appear in the data 
collection forms.  
   
The full analysis set will include participants who have responded to at least one  SMS message 
post-randomization. Descriptive statistics will be computed for each treatment group; medians 
and percentiles will be reported for skewed continuous variables. For primary and secondary 
outcomes, descriptive statistics and 95% confidence inter vals will be used to summarize the 
differences between groups. The secondary outcome of BP and other continuous variables will 
be assessed with a repeated -measures analysis using a mixed linear model approach. The 
Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to com pare MA between groups. Hypothesis tests will be 2 -
sided using the 0.05 significance level. Bonferroni -type adjustments for multiple testing will be 
implemented to control type I errors. Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS software 
(SAS Instit ute, Cary, NC).  
  
Treatment assignment will be determined using blocked randomization  
The primary analysis will consist of all subjects who responded with at least one BP 
measurement  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Human Subjects Protection  
 
Subject Recruitment Methods  
 
Subjects will be identified when they come to an office visit and their blood pressure is not well 
controlled. The PI [CONTACT_30223] (internal medicine preceptors or residents) will  verbally alert the 
study coordinator on site of possible participants based on B P >140/90. The study team 
member will meet the patient in a private room in 7th Janeway, determine eligibility , and signed 
informed consent will be obtained from each subject. Once enrolled, th e subjects will be 
contact[CONTACT_795980]. To ensure equal access to participation among 
women and minorities  we will translate all materials and questions to Spanish. T he privacy of 
 
Protocol version: 4.30.[ADDRESS_1097903]’s cell phone device the study team will ensure the subject is aware of 
the configuration feature on  the device to only show text messages upon unlocking the phone.

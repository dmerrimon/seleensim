Amendment 6 ( 12-Apr-2018 ) 
This amendment is considered to be non-substantial  based on the criteria set forth in 
Article  10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the  Council of the 
European Union  (38) because it neither significantly impacts the safety or physical/mental 
integrity of subjects nor the scientific value of the trial .  
Overall rationale for the amendment  
The protocol was updated to clarify how to handle subjects who experience a worsening of 
psoriasis during the follow -up phase.

Rationale for trial 
design  
Section 6.1.1  
Overview  
Section 6.1.3  
Initial open -label 
treatment phase  
Appendix 1  
Protocol summary  The trial will inclu de a screening phase of 
up to 4  weeks, an open -label treatment 
phase of 4  weeks, a randomised double -
blind maintenance phase of up to  52 
weeks, and a follow -up phase of up to  8 
weeks.  
This trial is a multi -centre, prospective 
trial, consisting of an initial open -label 
treatment phase of 4 weeks followed by a 
randomised, double -blind, vehicle -
controlled, maintenance phase of up to  52 
weeks in subjects with psoriasis vulgaris.  
Subjects who achieve treatment success 
(PGA score of ‘clear’ or ‘ almost clear’ 
with at least a 2 -grade impr ovement from 
baseline) at Visit 2  will be randomised in a 
ratio of 1:1 in a double -blind fashion to 
either LEO [ZIP_CODE] or vehicle (maintenance 
IP) twice weekly for up to  52 weeks.   
Methodology: (…) maintenance phase of 
up to  52 weeks in subjects with psoriasis 
vulgaris, and an 8 -week follow -up period.  
Duration of treatment: (…)  A maintenance 
phase: randomised treatment (LEO [ZIP_CODE] 
or vehicle) twice weekly for up to  [ADDRESS_136162] all adverse 
events (AEs), and an independent 
adjudication panel of dermatologists  [ADDRESS_136163]  
will review all treatment -emergent  AEs 
(blinded data) to identify adverse drug 
reactions of concern associated with long -
term topi[INVESTIGATOR_121464].  
A panel of three  [ADDRESS_136164]  (“Adjudication Panel”) 
will review all reported  treatment -
emergent  AEs to identify AEs of concern 
associated with long -term use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_121465] a causal relationship 
between the trial medication and the event 
is at least a reasonable possibility.  
The Adjudication Panel will not review 
AEs which occurred prior to 
application of the first dose of IP; this 
includes AEs reported by [CONTACT_121545] (who pe r definition did not start 
open -label treatment).  Since s ide effects from steroids 
may also be endocrine -related , it 
was decided to include an 
endocrinologist in the adjudication 
committee.  
It has been specified that  the 
Adjudica tion Panel will only 
review treatment -emergent AEs . 
Section 3.3.[ADDRESS_136165]  10% 
between 10 and 30%  of the BSA. The 
aim is to achieve approximately 25 
subjects undergoing HPA axis testing 
after 52 weeks of exposure.   
Adrenal function testing will be 
undertake n in a subset of approximately 
30 randomised subjects with psoriasis 
affecting more than 10%  between 10 and 
30% of the BSA. The aim is to include 
25 subjects undergoing HPA axis 
testing after 52 weeks of exposure.  This 
means that up to 60 subjects fullfilling the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for this part of 
the trial may need to be enrolled and 
ACTH -tested at Visit [ADDRESS_136166] psoriasis affecting 
between 10 and 30%  of the BSA in 
agreement with inclusion criterion 
no. 12.  
TMF-[ADDRESS_136167] on HPA axis (in a subset of subjects 
with disease involvement >10%  BSA  of 
between 10 and 30% of BSA ), based on 
serum cortisol ≤18 mcg/dL 30 minutes 
after cosyntropin injection at Week 4, 
Week 28, and end of trial (Week 56) or 
early withdrawal.  
Furthermore, the inclusion criteria for 
participating in the HPA axis test are 
either  “Moderate” or “Severe” in the 
baseline PGA assessment or and a 
baseline BSA of at least 10%  between 10 
and 30% .  It has been specified that subjects 
undergoing HPA axis testing 
should have psoriasis affecting 
between 10 and 30% of the BSA  in 
agreement with inclusion criterion 
no. 12.  
Section 6.1.5  
Follow -up phase  
(FU2)  For subjects undergoing the 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 
challenge test, a follow -up visit (Visit 
FU2) will ta ke place [ADDRESS_136168] performed at the end 
of treatment (Visit 15/Early Withdrawal)  
if this the end of treatment  test show sed 
a serum cortisol concentration ≤18 mcg/dl 
at both  30 minutes and 60  minutes  after 
ACTH challenge ( 39, 40).  
If the results of the ACTH challenge test 
at Visit FU2 continue to show a serum 
cortisol concentration ≤18mcg/dl at both  
30 minutes and 60 minutes  after ACTH  
challenge, further ACTH challenge tests  
should be performe d, but not more often 
than at 4 -weekly intervals, until the 
adrenal suppression resolves (i.e. serum 
cortiso l concentration >18mcg/dl at 
30 minutes or at 60 minutes  after the 
ACTH -challenge , or at both time 
points ).  
Refer to Section 8.12.[ADDRESS_136169].  To avoid overdiagnosing adrenal 
insufficiency, only subjects with 
abnormal results at both timepoints 
after ACTH challenge (30 minutes 
and 60  minutes)  will need to come 
back to the trial site for additional 
ACTH challenge tests.  
Section 6.1.5  
Follow -up phase  
(FU3)  It has been clarified when the [ADDRESS_136170] the trial after the initial 
treatment period will al so need to 
be followed -up for 8  weeks  (in 
agreement with the definition of 
rebound [ section  [IP_ADDRESS] ]). 
TMF-[ADDRESS_136171],  up to 60 subjects 
(with BSA over 10%) may need to be 
enrolled to achieve approximately [ADDRESS_136172] been randomised for the HPA axis 
testing. The total number of randomised 
subjects can exceed 380 in order to 
achieve a suffici ent number of subjects 
for long -term evaluation of safety and 
HPA testing . 
This will also include information on 
when the threshold of 20% of subjects 
with a ‘mild’ PGA is reached, and when a 
sufficient number of subjects ( 30 
randomised  approximately 25 subjects 
with 52 weeks of exposure ) have been 
included in the HPA axis part of the trial.  The number of randomised subjects 
may need to be adjusted to ach ieve 
the required exposure data. This 
will depend on the actual drop -out 
rate in the trial .

LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 8 of 176 
Section number 
and name  [CONTACT_18054] 6.3  
Randomisation  The maximum number of subjects to be 
enrolled with ‘mild’ dise ase according to 
the PGA is capped at 20% to ensure 
similar distribution of disease severity at 
baseline as in previous LEO [ZIP_CODE] short -
term trials and hence similar trial 
population.  This paragraph has been re-worded 
and moved to section 10.6 ; the cap 
of 20% of mild subjects refers to 
the population who will be treated 
with open -label IP, not the 
randomised subject population 
(who have already been exposed to 
4 weeks open -label treatment ). 
Section 7.8.3  
Restrictions during 
the trial – 
follow -up period  Note that treatment with Enstilar® or 
IP is not allowed during the follow -up 
period (Section 6.1.5 ).  
Otherwise, there are no restrictions on the 
use of concomitant treatment during the 
follow -up period.  Specification that use of Enstilar® 
or IP is not allowed during the 
follow -up period.  
This sentence was deleted since  
restrictions may  apply to subjects 
who are in follow -up due to 
abnormal ACTH test results.  
Section 8.1  
Schedule of trial 
procedures  Clarification that the FU3 visit will occur 
8 weeks after end of treatment or early 
withdrawal.  
A visit window (±4 days) for the FU3 visit 
has been included . In the previous version of the 
protocol, the FU3 visit and any 
unscheduled visits during the 
follow -up phase were all described 
as FU3. A clear distinction has 
been made between FU3 and 
unscheduled follow -up visit.  
It has been specified that concomitant 
medications and concomitant procedures 
should be recorded at the FU3 visit.  To monitor use of any medication 
up to the FU3 visit.  
An unscheduled follow -up visit has been 
included.  To clarify how to handle subjects 
who experience a worsening of 
psoriasis during the follow -up 
phase.  
Footnote no. 19 updated  to specify that 
FU2 visit is only required if 
end-of-treatment serum cortisol 
concentration is ≤18  mcg/dl at both 
[ADDRESS_136173].  To avoid overdiagnosing adrenal 
insufficiency, only subjects with 
abnormal results at both timepoints 
after ACTH challenge (30  minutes 
and 60  minutes) will need to com e 
back to the trial site for additional 
ACTH challenge tests.  
Footnotes no. [ADDRESS_136174] the difference between 
an unscheduled follow -up visit and the 
FU3 visit.  To clarify how to handle subjects 
who experience a worsening of 
psoriasis during the follow -up 
phase.  
23) After end of treatment visit (Visit 15
or Early Withdrawal) only events of
rebound are routinely collected.Footnote deleted since  all AEs , 
including rebound events , will be 
collected during the whole trial up 
to the FU3 visit.

23)Subjects with a serum cortisol
concentration ≤18mcg/dl at both [ADDRESS_136175] be
captured in the UNS FU page in the
eCRF.Footnote added to remind 
investigators about the criteria for 
further follow -up of ACTH 
subjects. The footnote also 
describes where such follow -up 
information should be recorded in 
the e CRF.  
24) If the subject withdraws prior to
completing the initial open -label 
treatment phase, the ACTH -challenge 
should not be performed.  Footnote added for clarification  in 
agreement with Section 8.12.1 .  
25) Only required if last FU3 is
performed at  the trial site  Footnote ad ded to clarify that 
certain investigator assessments  at 
FU3 are only required if the visit is 
performed at the trial site.  
Section 8.12.[ADDRESS_136176] at 
Visit 15 (end of maintenance phase ), or at 
early withdrawal ) shows a serum cortisol 
concentration ≤18 mcg/dl at both  
[ADDRESS_136177] is required 4  weeks later 
(FU2 visit) . 
If the results of the ACTH -challenge test 
at this visit  the FU2 visit  continue to show 
a serum cortisol concentration ≤18mcg/dl 
at both  30 minutes and 60  minutes  after 
ACTH challenge, further ACTH challenge 
tests should be performed, but  not m ore 
often than at 4 -weekly intervals, until the 
adrenal suppression resolves (i.e. serum 
cortiso l concentration >18mcg/dl at 
30 minutes or at 60 minutes  after the 
ACTH challenge, or at both time points ). 
The data from such further ACTH 
challenge tests must  be captured in the 
unscheduled follow -up visit page in the 
eCRF.  To avoid overdiagnosing adrenal 
insufficiency, only subjects with 
abnormal results at both timepoints 
after ACTH challenge (30  minutes 
and 60  minutes) will need to come 
back to the trial sit e for additional 
ACTH challenge tests.  
It has been specified where to 
capture data from further ACTH 
challenge tests.  
Section 8.12.1  
Safety laboratory 
blood analysis  After this  Within 10 minutes after blood 
sampling , CORTROSYN® / Synacthen®  
is will be  injected, as described in section 
10.9.  A time window for the injection of 
CORTROSYN® / Synacthen® has 
been specified to clarify the 
procedure .  
TMF-[ADDRESS_136178] has signed the 
informed consent form until the end of 
treatment  FU3 visit . Events of  rebound 
will be collected during the follow  up 
period to end of trial . Refer to section  
[IP_ADDRESS]  for a definition of rebound . To clarify that rebound events will 
be collected during the whole trial 
up to the FU3 visit.  
Section 9.[ADDRESS_136179].  To clarify that related  AEs will be 
followed up from the FU3 visit 
rather than from end of treatment.  
Section 10.6  
Treatment 
assignment  A cap on the number of subjects with 
‘mild’ disease according to the PGA is set 
at 20%.  The maximum number of 
subjects to be included in the open -label 
phase  with ‘mild’ disease according to 
the PGA at baseline  (visit 1) is capped 
at 20% to ensure similar distribution of 
disease severity at baseline as in 
previous LEO [ZIP_CODE] short -term trials 
and hence similar trial population.  Clarification that the cap of 20% of 
mild subjects refers to the baseline 
population w ho will be treated with 
open -label IP, not the randomised 
subject population (who have 
already been exposed to 4  weeks 
open -label treatment ).

CORTROSYN® 
and Synacthen®  Table 15:  
Ampoules: [ADDRESS_136180] been 
exposed for 4  weeks during the open -label 
treatment phase. During  the maintenance 
phase with 380  randomised subjects, 
assuming an exponential de cline and a 
drop-out rate of 30% over [ADDRESS_136181] 
326 subjects exposed for a total of 
26 weeks, an d 273  subjects exposed for a 
total of 52  weeks.  
If the actual drop out rate is higher 
than the assumed drop out rate of 30%, 
more subjects will be recruited and 
randomised to achieve at least 
[ADDRESS_136182] 100  subje cts 
(including approximately 25  subjects 
under going HPA axis testing) with 
52 weeks of exposure.  
Recruitment will be stopped when a 
sufficient number of subjects are 
randomised in order to obtain the 
above, consider ing the observed 
randomisation and drop -out rates.  The number of randomised subjects 
may need to be adjusted to achieve 
the required exposure data. This 
will depend on the actual drop -out 
rate in the trial .

3 Introduction and Rationale  
3.1 Psoriasis vulgaris  
Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease that occurs in approximat ely 2 % of the worldwide 
population  (1, 2). In addition to skin manifestations , psoriasis is associated with multiple co -
morbidities e.g. arthritis and cardiovascular disease (3, 4). The hallmark of psoriasis  is 
inflammation of the skin as a result of excessive response to danger signals. In the majority of 
subjects, psoriasis manifests as plaque type psoriasis, clinically seen as shar ply demarcated, 
elevated, scaling, erythematous plaques located predominantly on the scalp, extensor sides of 
elbows and knees, and the sacral region ( 3, 5, 6). Skin lesions can be painful, pruritic and may 
cause significant emotional and physical discomfort (7, 8). 
The majority of affected subjects has mild to moderate disease and can be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_81967] (9). In the group of  subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis , topi[INVESTIGATOR_121466], systemic or biologic agents ( 9, 10). One of 
the advantages of topi[INVESTIGATOR_81969] a reduced risk of systemic toxicity compared to other 
treatment modalities.  
Psoriasis is a life -long disease for  most patients and there is a need for a safe long -term 
treatment strategy. When psoriasis treatment is discontinued, lesions will likely recur.  
Optimal management of psoriasis  must therefore include a strategy for initial rapid relief of 
symptoms as well  as a long-term strategy to maintain remission .  
3.[ADDRESS_136197]  
LEO [ZIP_CODE]  aerosol  foam (referred to as LEO [ZIP_CODE]) is a combination  product develope d for 
the topi[INVESTIGATOR_121467]. It contains calcipotriol 50 mcg/g  and 
betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]).  LEO [ZIP_CODE] is packed in an aluminium can with 
dimethyl ether (DME) and butane propellants. The propellants evaporate quickly after 
application leaving a foam on the skin surface.  
LEO [ZIP_CODE]  is available on the market in United Stated ( US) and the European Union ( EU) 
(under the trade name [CONTACT_121647]® foam) for treatment of psoriasis vulgaris for up to 4 weeks.  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 22 of 176 
The clinical efficacy and safety of LE O 9010 0 has been documented in  vehicle - and active 
comparative trial s of 4 weeks duration . Three controlled safety and  efficacy trials invol ving 
more than 900 subjects , which formed the basis for marketing approval,  demonstrated  that 
LEO [ZIP_CODE]  is highly efficacious for the treatment of adult patients with psoriasis vulgaris 
over a 4 -week period. The data show ed that LEO [ZIP_CODE]  is a more efficacious treatment option 
than calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] ( calcipotriol /BDP) ointment and  the 
individual active ingredients, based on investigator -assessed treatment success and the 
proportion of subjects  achieving at least 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity 
Index  (PASI; PASI 75). LEO [ZIP_CODE] was well tolerated, with a safet y and tole rability profile 
comparable to calcipotrio l/BD P ointment and the individual active ingredients. Furthermore, a  
maximum use systemic exposure trial in subject s with moderate  to severe extensive psoriasis  
found no clinically relevant impact on the Hypothalam ic-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -Adrenal ( HPA ) axis or 
calcium homeostas is after 4 weeks of treatment  with LEO  [ZIP_CODE] (mean amount administered 
62 g/week  versus  approximately 30 g/week in the other 4 week trials) . 
Data supporting the safety and efficacy of LEO [ZIP_CODE]  for up to 12 weeks are derived f rom a 
12-week safety and efficacy trial in 460 subjects with psoriasis vulgaris (Trial LP0053 -1003),
which compa red LEO [ZIP_CODE] to calcipotrio l/BD P gel. This trial show ed that prolonged
treatment for up to 12 weeks led to con tinued improvement in disease severity in both the
LEO [ZIP_CODE] and calcipotriol /BDP gel arms, with improvement being more pronounced in the
LEO [ZIP_CODE] arm. The treatment with LEO  [ZIP_CODE] for up to 12 weeks was not associated with
any new safety findings  compare d to 4 weeks treatment; t he safety profile of LEO [ZIP_CODE] over
12 weeks was similar to that of calcipotriol /BDP gel over 12 weeks.  These data, together with
the d ata from the 4 -week controlled safety and efficacy trials, highlight ed that the su perior
efficac y of the foam  is achieved without compromising  tolerability.
Further information regarding LEO [ZIP_CODE] relevant to clinical trials can be found in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure ( IB) (11). 
3.[ADDRESS_136198] been ev aluated for maintenance 
of response  (12, 13, 14, 15, 16). The results show that approaches utilising alternating 
weekend and weekday treatment are effective and safe. However, they involve the use of 
multiple products on different days which may be challe nging for a patient in terms of 
adherence to treatment . Therefore, a maintenance regimen which uses  a single fixed -
combination product could simplify treatment . There is evidence to suggest  that twice weekly 
intermittent use of calcipotriol/BDP combination gel is effective in maintaining efficacy and 
reducing relapse rate compared to as needed use on the scalp (16). Based on these 
observations , twice -weekly use of  LEO  [ADDRESS_136199] adjusting the frequency of 
application, would be expected to contribute  to patient acceptance , compliance  and thereby 
[CONTACT_121546].  
3.3.2 Research hypothesis  
The present trial will evaluate the efficacy and sa fety of LEO [ZIP_CODE] used as a long -term 
twice -weekly maintenance therapy compared with vehicle. Following an initial 4 -week period 
where all subjects will be treated with LEO [ZIP_CODE] in accordance with the currently approved 
labeling , they will be randomis ed to receive either LEO [ZIP_CODE] or vehicle per the twice weekly 
maintenance regimen for 52 weeks . In case s of relapse , affected subjects in either treatment 
group will again receive LEO [ZIP_CODE]  to apply once daily for 4 weeks  on active  areas  on trunk 
and limbs . Thus,  the vehicle arm will also utili se re-treatment as needed , similar to the use in 
clinical practice for the licensed calcipotriol/BDP products.  Thus, the trial will  compare two 
ways of using LEO  [ZIP_CODE]: a proactive approach with fixed twice -weekly maint enance 
regimen with a conventional, reactive approach . The research hypothesis is that the proactive 
twice-weekly maintenance use of LEO  [ADDRESS_136200] to long -term 
efficacy that subjects who receive LEO  [ZIP_CODE] twice weekly will demonstrate superior 
respon se to those randomised to receive vehicle, as measured by [CONTACT_7459] i n 
remission .

3.3.3 Rationale for trial design  
Overall design and treatment duration  
The trial will include a screening p hase of up to 4 weeks, an open -label treatment phase of 
4 weeks , a randomised double -blind maintenance p hase of 52 weeks , and a follow -up phase 
of 8 weeks . 
In the initial open -label phase, all subjects will receive treatment with LEO [ZIP_CODE] once daily  
for 4 weeks . The purpose of this initial period of daily treatment is to allow clea rance 
(“treatment success ”) of the  psoriatic  lesions  so that subjects will enter the maintenance p hase 
in a symptom -free state.  Treatment success is defined as a Physician ’s Global Assessment of 
disease severity (PGA) score of ‘clear ’ or ‘almost clear ’ with at least 2 -grade improvement 
from b aseline.  
In the maintenance phase, subjects will be randomised to receive twice  weekly treatment with 
either LEO [ZIP_CODE] or vehicle  (maintenance investigational product [maintenance IP] ). At 
relapse  (defined as a PGA score o f at least ‘mild’), both treatment groups will receive 
LEO  [ZIP_CODE] (rescue investigational product [ rescue IP ]) to apply once daily  on affected areas  
on trunk and  limbs , with the purpose of regain ing the  disease control . Subjects will be treated 
for 4 weeks with rescue IP  on areas with active psoriasis , and will be instructed to also treat 
any additional areas that may become active during this 4 -week period  with rescue IP. During 
relapse subjects will continue twice weekly treatment with maintena nce IP on areas that are 
not active . Subjects  who do not achieve ‘clear ’ or ‘almost clear ’ according to the PGA after 
[ADDRESS_136201] as a reservoir for topi[INVESTIGATOR_121468] s (17). The effect of clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_121469] . (18) who concluded that a single dose maintained full 
anti-inflammato ry eff ect for 4 days . Proprietary  data on calcipotriol/ BDP  combination 
product s  suggest that the half -life in the skin is approximately 3 days  (19, 20). These data 
support the effectiv eness of a twice -weekly regimen  with 3 or 4 days between application s. 
The maximum allowanc e of maintenance IP during maintenance phase is set at 3 cans ( 3 x 
60 g) for [ADDRESS_136202] sufficient maintenance IP to use up to 
15 g/day (maximum daily dose according to the product labeling) twice weekly during each  
4-week period. Note that due to the visit window of +/ - 4 days, subjects may need up to
9 applications during a 4 -week period.  This amount is considered adequate as 15 g is
suffic ient to cover more than 30%  of body surface area ( BSA ), and it  is supported by [CONTACT_121547] 9 0100 clinical trials where sub jects with extensive psoriasis (15-30% of
BSA ) used on average 9 g per day, and s ubjects in short –term efficacy and safety trials used
on average less than [ADDRESS_136203] meet the inclusion/exclusion  criteria , which are 
designed to select a population that is representative for the target population and are 
consistent with the criteria used in the short -term pi[INVESTIGATOR_121470]; i.e., 
subjects of all disease severities amenable to topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588], with psoriasis lesions on the 
trunk and/or limbs involving between 2 -30% of BSA. The eligibility c riteria are selected to 
prevent any confounding issues with diagnosis and minimize  any possible effect of concurrent 
diseases or concomitant medications on clinical assessment.  
Assessments and endpoints  
Clinical assessments  including PGA , assessment of  severity of  a target lesion /location , signs 
and ext ent of psoriasis (to calculate PASI) will be obtained  by [CONTACT_121548].  Subjects will be required to complete a self -assessm ent of disease severity as well as 
quality of life que stionnaires, and to capture  psoriasis symptoms  using the  Psoriasis Symptom 
Inventory  (21, 22) on a regular basis during the trial .  
The primary endpoint will be the time to first relapse. Relapse is defined as a PGA score of at 
least ‘mild’, i.e., worsening of psoriasis from ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (a score required for 
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 26 of 176 
entering the  maintenance phase) to the same level of diseas e sev erity as required at study 
entry, thus necessitating the re -initiation of once daily treatment  on the active area (s). The 
secondary en dpoints , the number of relapses and the number of days  in remission ( ‘clear ’ or 
‘almost clear ’), are considered to be clinica lly meaningful .  
One of the safety  endpoints is  the rebound  phenomenon . Rebound may signify a severe 
deterioration of psoriasis that is significantly worse than  before the treatment was initiated or 
a change in the character of the psoriasis  (e.g., f rom plaque to pustular form ), or both. Per the 
Committee for Human Medicinal Products ( CHMP ) guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal products  indicated for treatment of psoriasis ( 23), rebound is defined as “worsening 
of psoriasis over baseline value (e.g. PASI>125%) or new pustular, erythrodermic or more 
inflammatory psoriasis occurring within 2 months of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_121471] y. A simple worsening of 
psoriasis beyond 2 months of therapy may represent the natural course of the disease (relapse) 
rather than a rebound associated with drug ”. The National Psoriasis Foundation Medical 
Advisory Board (US) has also proposed a standard definition  of rebound  (24). Rebound is 
said to occur if the PASI is 125% or greater than baseline, or if new generalized pustular, 
erythrodermic or  more inflammatory psoriasis occurs within 3 months of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374].  
However,  these definition s may not be optimal in patients with mild disease, with low PASI , 
where even a minor worsening in disease severity may fulfill the criteria for PASI >125% , 
without in fact being a severe and sudden worsening which is characteristic of rebound . 
Therefore, for the purpose of this trial, rebound will be defined as (i) an m-PASI ≥12 AND  an 
increase in m -PASI of ≥125% of the baseline value, or (ii) new pustular, e rythrodermic or 
more inflammatory psoriasis either a) within 2 months after discontinuation of once -daily 
treatment in the initial open -label phase , b) within 2 months after discontinuation of once - 
daily relapse treatment , or c) within 2 months after end of maintenance treatment  (up to Visit 
FU3) . Hence, only psoriasis that becomes considerably worse than it has previously been will 
be considered as rebound.   
Assessment of target lesion /location  is included as a complement to the PGA to capture 
information on severity of individual signs, i.e. redness, thickness and scaliness of target 
plaques.  To document the development of response over time, target  lesion /location  
photo graph s will be ta ken in a subset of patients recruited at one or a few selected sites 
equipped with  adequate  photographic equipment.  Subjects will need to give a separate 
written con sent for the collection of photo graph s. Even if  they do not accept the collection of 
photo graph s, they m ay still participate in the main part of the trial.   
One of the  main objective s of this trial is  to investigate the long-term safety of LEO [ZIP_CODE]  
over 56 (4 + 52 ) weeks, especially to evaluate the risk of  corticosteroid -related cutaneous 
TMF-[ADDRESS_136204]  all adverse events  (AEs) , and an independent 
adjudication panel of [ADDRESS_136205] will review all treatment -
emer gent AEs (blinded data)  to identif y adverse drug reactions of concern associated with 
long-term topi[INVESTIGATOR_121464].  
Because of the potential effect of  vitamin D analogue containing  products on calcium 
metabolism, there will be safety analys es of the parameters of calcium metabolism from blood 
and urine  sampl es. As in  previous LEO [ZIP_CODE] safety and efficacy trials, albumin -corrected 
serum calcium and spot urine calcium -creatinine ratio will be analysed in samples collected  at 
baseline, Week 4 and at  the end of trial.  
Laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency due to the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_81977] , however, physiologic adrenal suppression is a common occurrence o f little 
clinical significance  (25). Pathologic adrenal suppression from topi[INVESTIGATOR_121472] a 
very rare occurrence; after nearly half a century of world -wide topi[INVESTIGATOR_121473] , there is 
only a few clinical cases describing prolonged corticosteroid -induced pathological adrenal 
suppression ( 25). Furthermore, these cases occurred in adults using at least two times the 
maximum recommend ed dose of super -potent corticosteroids for as long as [ADDRESS_136206] moderate psoriasis 
affecting between  10 and 30 % of the BSA . The aim is to achieve approximately [ADDRESS_136207] of topi[INVESTIGATOR_121474] ( 26) and also  a previous recommendation  by [CONTACT_121549] ( FDA ) 
for a maximum use  systemic exposure trial (LEO [ZIP_CODE] -30). Testing will be done at baseline, 
at the end of the initial open -label phase ( Week 4 ), at Week 28, and at the end of trial ( Week 
56 or at early withdrawal ). 
Subjects will need to give a separate written consent for having ACTH challenge tests 
performed . If they do not agree to the  having ACTH challenge tests perfor med, the y may still 
participate in the main part of the trial.  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 28 of 176 
Local safety and tolerability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_121550] -term trials  with LEO [ZIP_CODE] . Clinical signs and 
symptoms will be assessed on a 4 -point scale (from absent to severe).  Perilesional erythema, 
oedema, dryness, and erosion will be assessed by [CONTACT_121551] . 
To support clinical decision -making  when treating psoriasis patients, it i s important to 
consider quality of life. Therefore, evaluation of quality of life is included in this trial by  
[CONTACT_121552] -5D-5L-PSO questionnaire , the Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(DLQI)  and the  Work Pr oductivity and Activity Impairment: Psoriasis questionnaire 
(WPAI:PSO) . The EQ -5D-5L-PSO is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health 
outcome . DLQI  is a validated dermatology specific questionnaire , which measures specific 
factors influencin g the quality of life for patients with skin disease. WPAI:PSO is a 
questionnaire which assesses the impact of psoriasis on patients ’ ability to work and perfor m 
regular activities. These questionnaires will complement the physicians ’ assessments to obtain 
a more complete understanding  of the subject ’s disease status and potential changes during 
this trial.  
A Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) is  included to assess the severity of psoriasis symptoms 
throughout the induction (open -label) and the mai ntenance phase.  It is anticipated that the 
symptom diary data recorded on a weekly bas is will provide a more sensitive measure of the 
effect of maintenance treatment than the monthly assessments of the PGA by [CONTACT_431].  
Concomitant treatments  
During the course of the trial, subjects must not use any concomitant treatments that have a 
possible effect on psoriasis vulgaris on the treatment area s (trunk and/or limbs). This includes 
various systemic treatments (e.g. systemic corticosteroids, retinoids, me thotrexate, ciclosporin 
and other immunosuppressants and biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014])  as well as topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786] s. Use of 
any drug except the IP for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris is prohibited on the treatm ent 
areas, only emollients are allowed  (but only on days when IP is not being applied ).  
As LEO [ADDRESS_136208] s with severe or extensive scalp psoriasis  requiring treatment with potent or

A stable concomitant treatment regimen (no start or change of dosage during the trial) with 
drugs that have a potential effect on psoriasis (e.g., beta blockers, anti -malarials, angiotensin -
converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors and lith ium) is allowed during the trial. Although these 
drugs have a potential effect on psoriasis, they are not known to cause fluctuations in dise ase 
severity and therefore should not affect the subject ’s response to trial medication.  
Prior to randomisation, a washout period should be completed if the subject is treated, or has 
recently been treated with anti -psoriatic treatments or other relevant medication that could 
influence the outcome of the trial.  Additional restriction apply for subjects participating  in the 
HPA axis test.  
Biomarkers  
Psoriasis is an immune mediated inflammatory skin disease and is associated with serious 
morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression and psoriatic arthritis.  
Potential biomarkers related to inflammation, cardiovascular diseas e and metabolic syndrome 
have been identified. In patients with severe psoriasis responding to systemic therapy, 
biomarkers of cardiovascular disease have been demonstrated to improve ( 27). In this trial, a 
panel of serum biomarkers is being investigated in order to assess inflammation and 
cardiovascular risk . Blood samples will be taken  at baseline , at Week 28,  and at the end of 
treatment  (for patients who have completed at least 40 weeks  of the trial from baseline) in a 
patient population with ‘mild’ to ‘severe ’ disease treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588].   
Subjects will need to give a separate written consent for the collection of these blood s amples.  
If they do not agree to the collection of samples for this purpose, they may still participate in 
the main part of the trial.   
3.[ADDRESS_136209] been shown to provide safe and effective initial therapy to achieve clearance of the 
lesions. However, disease signs usually recur within a few months after discon tinuation of 
treatment  in the majority of patients (28) .  
LEO [ADDRESS_136210] of  calcipotriol 50 mcg/g and betamethasone 0.5 mg/g 
(as dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]). Long -term safety of both active components  of LEO [ZIP_CODE], used 
individually or in combination, has been well documented. Long -term studies of calcipotriol 
have shown that it is well tolerated with few adverse effects ( 29, 30). The local adverse effects 
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 30 of 176 
of calcipotriol are related to skin irritation, including burning, itching, and erythema. With the 
exception of skin irritation, side effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_121475]; the risk of 
hypercalcemia /hypercalciuria  is low when the drug is used appropriately.  
The long -term use of products containing potent or super -potent topi[INVESTIGATOR_121476] a mu ltitude of adverse cutaneous side effects, such as skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae 
and tachyphylaxis. Systemic reactions due to topi[INVESTIGATOR_121477], 
however, they can be severe. Adrenocortical suppression, cataract, infec tion, impaired 
glycaemic control of diabetes mellitus, and increase of intra -ocular pressure can occur, 
especially after long -term treatment of large areas and/or with doses exceeding recommended 
doses. Therefore, intermittent maintenance treatment is a co mmonly recommended approach 
for corticosteroids to control the signs of psoriasis while reducing drug exposure and thereby 
[CONTACT_121553]  (31). 
LEO [ZIP_CODE]  (calcipotriol 50 mcg/g plus betamethasone 0.5 mg/g [as dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]]) has proved 
to be a highly effective and well tolerated treatment for psoriasis vulgaris with a favourable 
benefit/risk profile when used for 4  and up to 12 weeks ( 11), but no long -term trials or 
investigations of the risk of skin atrophy or duration of remi ssion and risk of rebound have 
been conducted.  
The long -term use of repeated courses of the calcipotriol /BPD  combination has been 
investigated with the ointment and gel formulation (Daivobet® ointment and Daivobet® gel), 
and demonstrated to provide safe, efficacious management of psoriasis of the body and scalp 
over the course of one year ( 32, 33). The treatment did not appear to be associated with a 
higher incidence of corticosteroid -related AEs during the long -term therapy than calcipotriol -
based regime ns. 
The purpose of the present trial is to investigate if LEO [ADDRESS_136211]  (i.e., 4 weeks courses of once daily treatment upon re -occurrence of active 
lesions). This means that also subjects in the vehicle arm will be provided with medication 
effective in the treat ment of psoriasis.  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 31 of 176 
Comparisons of safety data between LEO [ZIP_CODE] and the two other marketed formulations 
show that the systemic safety profile and short -term AE pro file of LEO [ZIP_CODE] are similar to 
those of calcipotriol/BDP  ointment and calcipotriol/BDP  gel, and no new safety concerns 
have emerged for LEO [ZIP_CODE] beyond those already described for the calcipotriol/BDP 
combination product in the ointment and gel formulations. Based on t he fact that the potency 
of LEO  [ZIP_CODE] is only moderately increased when compa red to Daivobet® ointment, with no 
enhanced systemic effects, and the short -term safety profiles of the two formulations are 
similar, no  specific safety or tolerability concerns are anticipated with the proposed long -term 
treatment.  
Subject s participating in the trial  will be under careful supervision of a dermatologist or 
general practitioner experienced in  Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) clinical trials and in the 
handling of psoriasis vulgaris during the entire course of the trial and will be required to 
attend planned trial visits every 4 weeks  as well as unscheduled visits in case of relapse . At 
either their own, or the physician ’s discretion, subjects may be withdrawn from the trial at any 
time.  
Overall, the expected benefit s related to  long-term therapy  outweighs the anticipated  risks and 
inconvenience for the participating subjects .

6 Trial Design   
6.1 Overall Trial Design 
The overall trial design is illustrated in Figure 1 below.  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 33 of 176 
Figure 1 Trial Design  
6.1.1 Overview  
This trial is a multi -centre, prospective trial, consisting of an initial open -label treatment 
phase of 4 weeks followed by a randomised, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, maintenance 
phase of 52 weeks in subjects with psoriasis  vulgaris.  
After the screen ing p hase, subjects deemed eligible for the trial (adults with psoriasis vulgaris 
on the trunk and/or limbs rated as at least ‘mild’ according to  the PGA, BSA 2 -30% and 
m-PASI of at least 2) wil l be enrolled to the initial open -label phase, where they will  apply
LEO [ZIP_CODE] once daily on the psoriatic lesions  on trunk and/or limbs for 4 weeks.
Subjects  who achieve treatment success ( PGA score of ‘clear ’ or ‘almost clear ’ with
at least a 2 -grade improvement from baseline) at Week 4 will be randomised in a
1:1 ratio to a maintenance phase of 52 weeks with LEO  [ZIP_CODE] or vehicle
(maintenance IP) twice weekly.
Subjects who do not achiev e treatment success after 4 weeks of once daily
treatment (i.e., non -responders) will be discontinued from the trial .
During the randomised maintenance phase, subjects will apply maintenance IP  twice weekly  3 
or 4 days apart  (fixed days ) on all areas on the trunk and limbs where lesions have cleared or 
almost cleared after the initial open -label phase or after relapse tre atment . Subjects will be 
assessed regularly at clinical  visits (every 4 weeks). In addition, if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_121478]-[ADDRESS_136212], a relapse (exacerbation of psoriasis) has occurred between two regular monthly visits, 
the subject will be assessed by [CONTACT_121554].   
Following confirmation of a relapse the subject wi ll be provided with rescue IP  and will be 
asked to apply it to the active  area(s) on trunk and /or limbs, irrespective of whether those 
areas were  active at baseline  or they are new lesions . The rescue IP  is to be applied once daily  
on the active ar eas for 4 weeks . (Note: T his treatment is referred to as ‘relapse ’ or ‘rescue ’ 
treatment) . If additional areas become active  during rescue treatment , these should also be 
treated once daily with rescue IP . During a relapse, areas that are not active  will continue 
twice weekly maintenance treatment.  
If a score of ‘clear ’/’almost clear ’ according to the PGA is regained after 4 weeks,
the twice  weekly ma intenance regimen will be re -started  on the now ‘clear ’/’almost
clear ’ area(s)  according to the original randomisation scheme  (for details see
section 6.1.4 ).
If a score of ‘clear ’/almost clear ’ according to the PGA is not regained after the [ADDRESS_136213]: Q1-[ADDRESS_136214] : Q3-2019 
Estimated number of trial sites and country allocation: Approximately 58 sites in Canada , 
[LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Poland, [LOCATION_008]  and [LOCATION_002].  
6.1.2 Screening/Washout Phase  
Prior to performance of any  trial related procedure (including washout), signed informed 
consent must be obtained from the subject.  
A washout period will  have to  be completed for subjects who are or have recently been treated 
with anti -psoriatic treatments or othe r relevant medication not permitted as def ined by [CONTACT_121555] (see Section 7.3). The washout is to ensure that no other treatment could  
interfere with the response obtained with the  IPs in the trial. The duration  of the washout 
period is limited for logistical reasons to a maximum of [ADDRESS_136215] recently been treated with biologics that require more 
than a 4 week washout period (e.g. ustekinumab should not be used for 16 weeks prior to 
commencing the trial), will not be eligible for the trial unless they have been off - treatment for 
several weeks (e.g. at least 12 weeks for ustekinumab) prior to the el igibility evaluation.  
TMF-[ADDRESS_136216] ’s ongoing eligibility for the trial will be made at Visit 1. 
However, if no was hout is needed the subject can enter Visit [ADDRESS_136217] enter  an initial open -label  treatment phase , where they will be 
instructed to apply LEO [ZIP_CODE] once daily on the psoriatic  lesions  on trunk and limbs for 
4 weeks.  All trial medication needed for 4 weeks ( 7 cans of LEO [ZIP_CODE] ) will be dispensed at 
Visit 1.    
The first application of the trial medication should be made at Visit [ADDRESS_136218] attended  Visit 1 . For 
detailed treatment instructions, see section 10.2. 
After 4 weeks , subjects will be asked to return  to the trial site for clinical evaluation and 
medication accou ntability  (Visit 2) . All trial medication dispensed at Visit 1 will be collected.  
Subje cts who achieve treatment success (PGA score of ‘clear ’ or ‘almost clear ’ with at least a 
2-grade improvement from baseline) at Visit 2 will be randomised in  a ratio of 1:1 in a
double -blind fashion to either LEO [ZIP_CODE] or vehicle  (maintenance IP)  twice  weekly  for [ADDRESS_136219] cleared  after 
treatment was initiated at baseline. Any additional non -active psoriatic lesions (i.e. lesions not 
present at baseline that have been cleared or almost cleared by [CONTACT_121556] a 
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 36 of 176 
relapse ) should be treated with maintenance IP as well . Maintenance IP  should be applied 3 or 
4 days apart . The choice of the application days will be left to subjects ’ preference , and  these 
days will be fixed throughout the trial (e.g., Thursday and Sund ay); this needs to be settled at 
Visit 2 . Subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_121557]  4 weeks from 
Visit  2 to Visit 15. Furthermore, depending on when relapse occurs in relation to the regular 
4-week visits  (also referred to as ‘scheduled ’ visits) , additional (unscheduled) visits may be
needed (outlined below).
All regular 4 -week ( scheduled ) visits between  or after  an unscheduled  visit or relapse 
follow -up visit should be performed.  
Based on these rules, there are the following op tions:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relapse at a regular 4 -week (scheduled) visit 
In case a relapse of psoriasis ( defined as PGA of at least ‘mild’) is observed by [CONTACT_121558] a regular monthly visit, the subject will be provided with rescue IP  and 
instructed  to apply it on the affected areas on trunk and limbs  once daily for 4 weeks  (all 
active  psoriatic lesions  including any new areas that become active  during this 4 -week 
treatment period ).  
Twice weekly maintenance treatment will continue unchanged on areas that are not ac tive. 
The subject will return to the trial site [ADDRESS_136220] is ‘clear ’ or ‘almost clear ’ according to PGA, maintenance treatment will be 
resumed on those  areas . If the PGA of ‘clear ’ or ‘almost c lear’ is not achieved after [ADDRESS_136221]  will exit the trial . For illustration, see Figure 2 below .

Figure 2 Relapse at a regular 4 -week (scheduled) visit  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relapse between regular 4-week (scheduled) visits – more than one 
week prior to the next regular visit 
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_121479], a relapse of psoriasis occurs between regular visits  when there 
is more  than  one week (7 days) to the next planned visit , the subject will contact [CONTACT_121559].  
If relapse is confirmed by [CONTACT_093], the subject will be provided with rescue IP  and 
instructed  to apply it once daily for [ADDRESS_136222] will be examined at the next regular 4 -week visit , but even if ‘clear ’/’almost 
clear ’ at the regular visit, rescue treatment will continue.  A relapse follow -up visit will take 
place at a relapse follow -up visit [ADDRESS_136223] is ‘clear ’ or ‘almost clear ’ according to PGA  at this relapse follow -
up visit , maintenance treatment on those  areas will be resumed and the su bject will follow the 
planned visit schedule.  
If the subject is not ‘clear ’or ‘almost clear ’ according to PGA after 4 weeks of relapse 
treatment, they will exit the trial . For illustration, see Figure 3 below .

Figure 4 Relapse between  regular 4 week (scheduled) visits – less than one week to the 
next regular visit   
Trial visits ( initial open -label treatment phase and m aintenance phase)  
The total trial duration  will be up to 64 weeks  (including 8 weeks follow -up) and will include 
at least [ADDRESS_136224] -randomisation visits (Visits 3 to 15) should be performed within ± 4 days of the 
scheduled time relative to Visit  2; if the visit is performed outside of the visit  window, the 
investigator should record the reason in the subject ’s medical  record.  The same visit window 
(± 4 days) is applicable for the follow -up of any unscheduled visits  due to relapse . 
The maintenance IP will be dispensed at each regular visit (from Visit 1 to Visit 14) and used 
maintenance IP will be  collected at the next regular visit (from Visit 2 to Visit 15) . Rescue IP 
will either be dispensed at a regular visit and collected at the next regular visit, or be 
dispensed at an unschedule d visit and collected at a relapse follow -up visit [ADDRESS_136225] s will be asked to complete the WPAI:PSO at baseline (Visit 1), at 
randomisation (Visit 2 /Week 4 ), after approximately 6 months (Visit 8/Week 28) and at the 
end of treatment  (Visit 15/Week 56 ).   
At baseline (Visit 1), subjects  will be instructed on how to capture psoriasis symptoms in the 
eDiary (e.g. erythema, scaliness, itching, etc …) using the P SI.  
At home, subjects will complete the PSI d aily during the open -label treatment phase (starting 
at Visit 1) , then weekly during the first 28 weeks of the maintenance phase (Weeks 4 to 28) 
and the [ADDRESS_136226] weeks of the maintenance phase (Week 54 to 56 - only applicable for 
completers).  
The eDiary will also be used to record adherence to the once daily treatment reg imen during 
the initial open -label treatment phase  as well as the twice weekly  and once -daily  treatment 
regimen s during the maintenance phase  and relapse .  
6.1.5 Follow -up Phase  
There are three t ypes of follow -up visits , here  listed in chronological order:  
Follow -up Visit 1 (FU1) :  
A follow up visit  1 is only relevant for subjects with an ongoing AE at end of treatment. A 
follow -up visit/contact (FU1) should be conducted  14 (± 2) days after  the last on -treatment 
visit (Visit 15/Early Withdrawal ), unless the final outcome of the event, as defined below, has 
been determined before then.  
This follow -up visit/contact (FU1) will take place only if:  
1.there is an on -going SAE at the last on -treatment visit.
2.there is an on -going non -serious AE at the last on -treatment  visit which is classified as
possibly or probably related to  the IPs
3.the albumin -corrected serum calcium is above the reference range at the last
on-treatment  visit
4.the calcium :creatinine ratio  is above the reference range and clinically significant at
the last on -treatment visit
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 41 of 176 
Where the (sub)investigator considers it appropriate, the Follow -up Visit may be performed  as 
a telephone contact.  If a subject also is elegible for a follow up visit 2 (FU2), the follow -up on 
the ongoing AE can wait until FU2 ( see below).  
Follow -up Visit 2 (FU2) : 
For subjects undergoing the adrenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH) challenge test , a follow -up 
visit ( Visit FU2 ) will take place [ADDRESS_136227] performed at  the end of 
treatment  (Visit 15/Early Withdrawal ) if the end of treatment  test show s a serum cortisol 
concentration ≤18 mcg/dl at both 30 minutes and 60 minutes after ACTH  challenge  (39, 40).  
If the results of the ACTH challenge test at Visit FU2 continue to show a serum cortisol 
concentration ≤18mcg/dl at both 30 minutes and 60  minutes after ACTH challenge, further 
ACTH  challenge tests should be performed, but not more often than at 4 -weekly intervals, 
until the adrenal suppression resolves (i.e. serum cortisol concentration >18mcg/dl at 
30 minutes  or at 60 minutes  after the ACTH -challenge , or at both time-points). 
Refer to Section  8.12.[ADDRESS_136228].  
Follow -up visits  should be performed within ± 4 days of the scheduled time; if they are 
outside this window, the (sub)investigator should record the reason in the subject ’s medical  
record but LEO do not need to be notified.  
Follow -up Visit 3 (FU3) : 
All subjects should be followed up for events of rebound for [ADDRESS_136229] application of 
IP. The different scenarios are outlined below:  
Subjects who do not use rescue medication at Visit  [ADDRESS_136230]
(FU3) 8  weeks after Visit  15. Relapses confirmed at Visit  15 will be treated at th e
investigator ’s discretion; treatment with Enstilar® or IP is not allowed.
Subjects who have completed 4  weeks of rescue treatment at Visit  15 (that is,
Visit  15 is a relapse follow -up visit, see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) will have a final contact
(FU3) 8  weeks after Visit  15.
For s ubjects who use rescue medication at Visit  15 (that is, rescue medication was
dispensed at an unscheduled visit after Visit  14 [see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ]), the 8 -week
follow -up period will start after completion of the 4 -week rescue treatment regimen
(that is, at the relapse follow -up visit) .
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 42 of 176 
Subjects who w ithdraw early from the trial, including subjects who leave the trial
after the initial [ADDRESS_136231] a follow -up visit (FU3)
[ADDRESS_136232] the site as soon as possible for an unscheduled follow -up visit (see below).  
If the subject has not experienced a worsening of their psoriasis  during the 8-week follow -up 
period , the FU3 contact [CONTACT_121560] a telephone contact , at the discretion of the 
investigator . If rebound is confirmed at the FU3 visit, the subject will be followed up for 
14 days or until resolution (whichever occurs first). If the rebound is considered an SAE , the 
event  must be followed up  until a final outcome has been established, i.e. the follow -up may 
continue beyond  the end of the clinical trial (see section  9.5). 
Rebound events in the follow -up period will be reported as (S)AEs in accordance with 
sections  9.[ADDRESS_136233] treatment visit (Visit 15/Early Withdrawal) , subjects should  be instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_121561] a worsen ing of their psoriasis  within the following 8  weeks  to 
schedule a follow -up visit ( ’unscheduled follow -up’). The unscheduled follow -up visit should 
take place no more than [ADDRESS_136234] will be 
treated at investigator ’s discretion according to clinical practice . Note that relapse or re bound 
should not be treated with  trial medication or  Enstilar® during the follow -up period . The 
subject may come back to the trial site for another unscheduled follow -up visit, at the 
investigator ’s discretion. The subject will continue in the follow -up phase until the FU3 vis it. 
If the subject experiences another worsening of their psoriasis within the [ADDRESS_136235], the aim  is to achieve approximately 25  subjects under going HPA axis 
testing after 52  weeks of exposure . 
The total number of randomised subjects can exceed 380  in order to achieve a suffici ent 
number of subjects for long -term evaluation of safety and HPA testing . 
The statistical power considerations for this sample size are described  in section  11.1. 
6.3 Randomisation  
Subjects will be randomis ed in a 1:1 ratio to receive LEO [ZIP_CODE] or vehicle twice weekly 
during the maintenance phase. Randomisation will be stratified by [CONTACT_121562] , HPA axis testing, 
and by [CONTACT_22789]  (mild, moderate, severe) . 
6.4 Blinding  
During the open -label treatment p hases  (initial and relapse treatment), all subjects will receive 
LEO [ZIP_CODE].  
During the maintenance phase, this trial is double -blind. Therefore , the packaging and 
labelling of the IPs mu st contain no evidence of their identity. It is not considered possible to 
differentiate between the IPs solely by [CONTACT_121563]. No effects of the IPs which would 
reveal the identity of the individual treatment allocations are expected. Consequently,  it is 
expected that the subjects and the site staff remain unaware of the individual treatment 
assignment during the conduct of the clinical trial.  
[ADDRESS_136236] Eligibility   
The (sub)investigator should only  enrol  subjects, who meet all eligibility criteria, are not put 
at undue risk by [CONTACT_19212], and can be expected to comply with the protocol .  
The subject ’s eligibi lity for the clinical trial must  be checked according to the inclusion and 
exclusi on criteria at visits specified in “Schedule of Trial Procedures ” [cf. 8.1].

Any concomitant medication and procedure must be recorded at visits indicated in 
Section  8.1. Details should include body location, diagnosis, start/stop date and if the 
procedure is inside the treatment area s. 
TMF-[ADDRESS_136275] will be perfor med at the trial site at  Visit 1, prior to  randomi sation 
(Visit 2) , and at all the subsequent visits including the last on -treatment visit ( or earlier in case 
of premature withdrawal).  The test will only be performed in female subjects of child -bearing 
potential. The test kits will be provided by [CONTACT_15622].  
8.[ADDRESS_136276]  be assesse d and recorded as specified in section  9. 
8.11 Other Safety Assessments  
All physician ’s dermatologic assessments of the treatment area must be performed by a 
dermatologist , certified physician ’s assistant, advanced registered nurse pract itioner  or general 
practitioner experienced in treating psoriasis vulgaris . The same person  should attempt to 
perform all dermatologic examinations of each individual subject.  
The following assessment  must  be performed :  
Assessment  of Local Safety and Tole rability  – physician and subject  
The assessment of local safety and tolerability will comprise signs assessed by [CONTACT_941] 
(sub)investigator and symptoms reported by [CONTACT_423]. The signs and symptoms are not 
required to be reported as AEs.  
At all treatment pha se visits (as indicated in section 8.1), the (sub)investigator will assess 
application site reactions for the following signs: perilesional erythema, perilesional oedema, 
perilesional dryness, and perilesional erosion. The subject  will assess the symptom 
‘application site burning or pain ’. 
For perilesional erythema, oedema, dryness and erosion, the area for the (sub)investigator to  
assess is the perilesional area, defined as the band of skin within two (2) cm from the bord er 
of the  psoriatic lesion, i.e. not the lesion itself, at any given time. The assessed signs must be  
present in this area, but may extend beyond it in a continuous manner.   
The area for the subject to assess application site burning or pain is the treatment  area, 
including the band of skin within two (2) cm from the border  of the area. The reported 
symptoms must be present in this area, but may extend beyond it in  a continuous manner.  
TMF-[ADDRESS_136277] (worst) skin reaction score across all tre atment areas  
will be recorded by [CONTACT_82047] 4 -point scale  as specified in  Table 6 (Physician ’s 
assessment) and Table 7 (Subject ’s assessment) respectively :

8.12 Laboratory Assessments  
For both blood analysis and urinalysis, the Central Laboratory will provide the materials  and 
instructions necessary for the collection and transportation of the samples.

LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 63 of 176 
8.12.1  Safety Laboratory Blood Analysis  
Blood samples (27 .5 ml) for biochemistry must be collected at the time points specified in the 
schedule of trial procedures (section 8.1).  
Because there will be no repeated blood sampling, venepuncture will be used rather than 
indwelling catheters to minimise subject discomfort and to reduce the extent of invasive 
procedures.  
Collection, handling and shipment instructions for blood samples for biochemistry are 
provided in a separate laboratory manual.  
Biochemistry  
The following analysis will be performed on the serum blood samples:  
Calcium – in samples collected at baseline (Visit 1), after 4 weeks (Visit 2 ) and
at the end of trial (Visit 15 , or at withdrawal  from trial ), plus at  FU1 Visit  if
applicable
Albumin - in samples collected at baseline (Visit 1), after 4 weeks (Visit 2) and
at the end of trialt  (Visit 15, or at withdrawal from trial), plus at FU 1 Visit if
applicable
25-OH vitamin D  - at baseline (Visit 1) only
Albumin -corrected serum calcium will be calculated in mmol/L using the formula:  
Serum calcium (total) in mmol/L + (0.02 x [40 -serum alb umin in g/L]) . 
The (sub)investigator must evaluate all results outside the reference range (‘clinically 
significant ’ or ‘not clinically significant ’) and sign and date. If any of the laboratory re sults 
are abnormal and judged as clinically significant, it should be recorded as an adverse event  
and the (sub)investigator should follow up with the subject as clinically appropriate.  
If the albumin -corrected serum calci um result is above the normal reference range at Visit 2, 
sampling should be repeated at the next visit. If the albumin -corrected serum calcium result is 
above the reference range at the last on -treatment visit, a follow -up visit should be performed 
for re peat sampling.  
TMF-[ADDRESS_136278]  (Assigned sites only)  
Adrenal function testing will be  undertaken in a subset of randomised  subjects with psoriasis 
affecting between 10 and 30 % of the BSA.  The aim is t o include [ADDRESS_136279] that is also scheduled 
for these visits.  
The t=0 (baseline) measurement of serum cortisol concentration fo r the ACTH -challenge test 
will be made from the biochemistry sample.  
The ACTH -challenge test will be performed at baseline (Visit 1), after 4 weeks (Visit 2), after 
28 weeks (Visit 8)  and at the end of trial (Visit 15 or at early withdrawal). If the subje ct 
withdraws prior to completing the initial open -label treatment phase, the ACTH -challenge test 
scheduled for Visit [ADDRESS_136280] discontinues the trial prior to 
week 56 (this also includes discontinuation due to not achieving ‘clear ’ or ‘almost clear ’ 
disease status following 4 weeks of once daily treatment following a relapse in psoriasis 
status), a follow -up visit must be scheduled within [ADDRESS_136281] was not perfomed on the same 
day (rescheduling required due to the time dependancy of the ACTH -challenge test).   
Subjects will not be included in  this proce dure of  the trial if one of the following applies to 
the serum cortisol concentration at V isit 1: 
• ≤5 mcg/dl pr e-stimulation (before CORTROSYN® / Synacthen® injection)
• ≤18 mcg/dl at 30 minutes after CORTROSYN® / Synacthen® injection
If the ACTH  challeng e test at Visit 1 5 (end of maintenance phase ) or at early withdrawal  
shows a serum cortisol concentration ≤18 mcg/dl at both [ADDRESS_136282] is required 4 weeks later  (FU2 visit) . 
If the res ults of the ACTH -challenge test at the FU2 visit continue to show a serum cortisol 
concentration ≤18mcg/dl at both 30 minutes and 60  minutes after ACTH challenge, further 
ACTH challenge tests should be performed, but not more often than at 4 -weekly intervals, 
until the adrenal suppression resolves (i.e. serum cortisol concentration >18mcg/ dl at 30 
minutes or at 60 minut es after the ACTH  challenge , or at both time -points ). The data from 
such further ACTH challenge tests must be captured in the unsched uled follow -up visit page 
in the eCRF.  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 65 of 176 
The following procedures should be performed prior to the ACTH  challenge tests: Heart rate 
and b lood pressure , blood/urine sampling for central l aboratory analysis 
(biochemistry/urinalysis) , blood sampling for biomark ers and urine pregnancy test (in female 
subjects of child -bearing potential).   
To perform the ACTH  challenge test, a 2.5 ml sample of venous blood will be drawn at 08.00 
a.m. ±30 minutes. This  sample is also the one on which the biochemistry analyses are
performed, as detailed above. Within 10 minutes after blood sampling , CORTROSYN® /
Synacthen®  will be  injecte d, as described in section 10.9. Two further 2.5ml samples of
venous blood will be drawn exactly 30 and 60 minutes after the injection (counting from the
end of the period over which the injection is given). Serum cortisol concentrations will be
determined for each blood sample by [CONTACT_15622].
The stop time of CORTROSYN® / Synacthen® injection will be recorded in the eCRF.  
ACTH challenge tests will require the subject's specific consent.  
8.12.2  Safety Urinalysis  
A 10 - 15 ml spot urine sample will be collected  at baseline (Visit 1 ), week 4 ( Visit 2 ) and at 
the end of tr ial (Visit 15, or  at withdrawal  from trial ), plus at  FU1 Visit  if applicable . 
The laboratory will report:  
Calcium
Creatinine
Calcium:creatinine ratio will be calculated.
The (sub)investigator must evaluate all calcium:creatinine ratio results outside the reference 
range (‘clinically significant ’ or ‘not clinically significant ’) and sign and date. If any o f the 
calcium:creatinine ratio   results are abnormal and judged as clinically significant, it should be 
recorded as an AE.  
If the calcium:creatinine ratio  result is above the normal reference range and judged as 
clinically significant at Visit 2, sampling should be repeated at the next visit. If the result is 
above the reference range at the last on -treatment visit  and judged as c linically significant by 
[CONTACT_093] , a follow -up visit should be performed for repeat ed sampling.

8.12.3  Pharmacodynamic (PD) Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Blood sampling for serum biomarkers  (for conse nting subjects)  
Blood samples will be drawn at Visit 1 (baseline) , Visit 8 (Week 28)  and Visit 15 (end of trial 
or earlier in case of early withdrawal in subjects who have completed at least 40 weeks  of the 
trial from baseline) for analysis of biomarkers related to systemic inflammation , 
cardiovascular disease , and metabolic sy ndrome. Initially, baseline and end of trial samples 
from the [ADDRESS_136283] baseline disease score will be analysed. Depending on the 
results from this analysis , the remaining samples may be analysed using a more focused 
biomarker panel. The ana lysis will be performed at the Biomarker Laboratory after unblinding 
of the trial, and the results will be described in a separate report. The Central Laboratory will 
provide the materials for the collection and the Biomarker Laboratory will provide 
instru ctions necessary for the handling and transportation of the samples.  
The blood volume will not exceed 24 ml ([ADDRESS_136284] 40 weeks  of 
the trial from baseline ).  
LEO w ill collect and store half of this blood volume  for future use  (i.e., for analyses not 
described above) . The sample will be stored in the bio bank established by [CONTACT_82093]. The samples 
will be used for future research performed  by [CONTACT_82093]. Collection, storage and future use of the 
samples will require the subject's consent and donation. Donation of the samples for future 
research is voluntary and subjects must give their separate written consent to confirm the 
donation and the terms  associated herewith.

2) Selected sites only. Note that T=[ADDRESS_136286] make self -assessments of quality of life and health status/symptoms at visits 
specified in the schedule of trial procedures ( section 8.1). To ensure unbiased answers, the 
PROs should be completed prior to other assessments  on the day of completion of the 
questionnaires  (when questionnaires are completed during the trial visits)  and the site staff 
should not challenge the subject ’s answers. How ever, t he subjects should be encouraged to 
answer all questions in the questionnaires . 
The DLQI, EQ -5D-5L-PSO and WPAI:PSO will be completed at the trial site on an electronic 
slate/tablet. The PSI  will be completed on an eDiary device, which will be provided for the 
subjects for use at home.  
Symptoms reported on the DLQI, EQ -5D-5L-PSO, WPAI :PSO  and PSI will not be captured 
as AEs, unless they are specifically mentioned as an AE by [CONTACT_121571]-leading question : “How have you felt since I saw y ou last? ”.  
However, the site should review the PRO responses and follow up with the subject if the 
subject e.g. indicates a different level of anxiety/depression than what the subjec t answers to 
the above -mentioned non -leading question, in order to ensure that the subject gets the proper

physician.  
DLQI, EQ -5D-5L-PSO, WPAI:PSO  and PSI data will be reported in the clinical trial report . 
The questionnaires should preferably be completed in the below  sequence . 
8.13.1  DLQI  
The DLQI is a validated, patient -reported, 10 -item questionnaire that captures the effects of 
dermatologic conditions on a patien t’s health -related quality of life (HRQoL). The questions 
evaluate daily activities, symptoms and feelings, leisure, work or school, personal 
relationships, and treatment .  
The DLQI will be completed by [CONTACT_121572] (Visit 1), at all monthly 
visits  during the maintenance phase, and at all unscheduled visits (see Appendix  8: DLQI ). 
8.13.2  EQ-5D-5L-PSO  
The EuroQoL -5D-5L is a standardized, pre ference -based, non –disease -specific instrument for 
describing and valuing HRQoL  (see Appendix 7: EQ-5D-5L-PSO). Its components include a 
questionnaire on five general health dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression)  and two psoriasis -related health dimensions (skin 
irritation and self -confidence)  each with five response levels, and a V AS represented on a 
thermome ter that allows patients to assess their health status with a score ranging from 0 
(worst health) to 100 (best health). Responses to the questions on the five dimensions result in 
a health state that can be converted into an index score based on the valuat ion of EuroQoL -5D 
health states from general population samples. The index score ranges from 0.00 to 1.00, 
where a score of 1.00 indicates full health and a 0.05 change is considered clinically 
meaningful.  
EQ-5D-5L-PSO will be administered at  baseline  (Visit 1) and  at all monthly visits during the 
maintenance phase,  as well  as at all unscheduled visits . This questionnaire will be filled out 
by [CONTACT_121573]. 
8.13.3  WPAI:PSO  
The impact of the psoriasis on subject ’s ability to work and perform regular activities will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_121574]: Psoriasis (WPAI:PSO) 
questionnaire ( see Appendix 9: WPAI:PSO ).The Work Productivity and Act ivity Impairment 
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 69 of 176 
Questionnaire Specific Health Problem (WPAI -SHP) is a validated instrument that has been 
used to study the impact of various diseases, including psoriasis, on patients ’ ability to work 
and perform daily activities. It can be used to assess the work productivity and activity 
impairment related to a variety of diseases, including psoriasis. It consist of [ADDRESS_136287] methodology, the following measures can be constructed from the questions: ( 1) 
current employment status; ( 2) absenteeism, defined as the percentage of time missed from 
work as a result of the disease; ( 3) presenteeism, defined as the percentage reduced 
productivity while working; ( 4) total activity impairment ( TAI), defined as the percentage 
impairment in regular daily activities other than work; and ( 5) total work productivity 
impairment (TWPI), representing the total p ercentage of work impairment associated with 
psoriasis from both absenteeism and presenteeism. The percentage of impairment associated 
with psoriasis will be assessed by [CONTACT_6904].  
This questionnaire will be administ ered at baseline (Visit 1), at randomisation (Visit 2/Week 
4), after approximately 6 months (Visit 8/Week 28)  and at the end of trial ( Visit 15/Week 56).  
This questionnaire will be filled out by [CONTACT_121573].  
8.13.4  Psoriasis symptom inventory  (PSI)  
The PSI, an eight -item measure to assess the severity of psoriasis symptoms will be 
completed by [CONTACT_121575] -label treatment phase (starting at Visit 1) 
and then weekly during the first 28 weeks of the maintenance phase (Weeks 4 to 32 (Visits 2 
to 9)) and the [ADDRESS_136288] weeks of the maintenance phase (Week 54 to 56  (Visits 14 to 15) - only 
applicable for completers ).  
The eight symptoms include itch, redness, scaling, burning , cracking, stinging, flaking and 
pain. ‘Scaling ’ refers to the skin forming plates or scales that represent compacted 
desquamated layers of stratum corneum, which may then peel off; ‘flaking ’ refers simply to 
loss of dry skin cells. Subjects rate the seve rity of each symptom on a 5 -point Likert -type 
rating scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very severe). Individual item scores are summed 
for a total score, which ranges from 0 to 32. The PSI will be administered as a 24-h recall 
version during the  initial open -label treatment phase and as a 7-day recall version during the 
maintenance phase  (the 7 -day version was previously shown to provide re sults equivalent to 
24-h recall version (22) (see  Appendix 10: Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) – 24 hours
recall  and Appendix 1 1: Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) – 7 days recall  respectively) .

At baseline (Visit 1) the subject will complete  this questio nnaire in the eDiary while at the 
trial site. The subject will then subsequen tly fill this out while at home for all other 
timepoints/periods.    
8.13.[ADDRESS_136289] ’s Global Assessment of Disease Severity  
This assessment will be made from baseline  (Visit 1) and at  all monthly visits during the

The face, scalp, genitals and skin folds (i.e. the axillae, the inguinal folds, the inter -gluteal 
folds and the infra -mammary folds) are not to be treated with the IPs or assessed as part of the 
efficacy analysis.  Also palms and soles are excluded.  
The (sub)investigator must make the assessments described below. Ideally, all assessments fo r 
a subject should be made by [CONTACT_63931] (sub)investigator.  
8.16.2  Physician ’s Global Assessment of D isease  Severity (PGA)  
From screening , and at all mo nthly visits during the maintenance phase, as well  as all 
unscheduled visits , the (sub)investigator will make a global assessment of the disease severity 
of psoriasi s of the trunk  and limbs  using the 5 -point scale specified in Table 10. This 
assessment will represent the average lesion severity on the trunk and limbs. The assessment 
will be based on the condition of the dise ase at the time of evaluation, and not in relation to 
the condition at a previous visit.

8.16.3  Physician ’s Assessment of the Extent and Severity of Clinical Signs 
(Redness, Thickness, Scaliness) ( m-PASI)  
From baseline ( Visit 1 ), and at all monthly  visits during the maintenance phase, as well  as all 
unscheduled visits , the (sub)investigator will make asse ssments of the extent and severity of 
clinical signs of the subject ’s psoriasis .  Assessment is not made for the  head (i.e. the face and 
scalp) . Hence, this PASI assessment is modified to excl ude the head.  
The extent  of psoriatic involvement will be recorded for each of the three areas  (arms, trunk 
and legs) using the following scale:  
0  =  no involvement  
1  =  < 10%  
2  =  10 - 29% 
3  =  30 - 49% 
4  =  50 - 69% 
5  =  70 - 89% 
6  =  90 - 100%  
This assessment of extent is the percentage of that body area that is affected, and not the 
percentage global BSA affected  (see section 8.16.4 ). For example, if one arm was totally 
affected, and the other arm was totally unaffected, the extent assessment for the arms would 
be 50% (half of the arms affected).  
The severity  of the psor iatic lesions in each of the three areas will be recorded for each of the 
clinical signs of redness, thickness and scaliness. For each clinical sign, a single score, 
reflecting the average severity of all psoriatic lesions on given body region, will be 
determined according to the following scale:  
Redness  
0 = none (no erythema)  
1 = mild (faint erythema, pi[INVESTIGATOR_82005])  
2 = moderate (definite light red erythema)  
3 = severe (dark red erythema)  
4 = very severe (very dark red erythema)  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 74 of 176 
Thickness  
0 = none (no plaque elevation)  
1 = mild (slight, barely perceptible elevation)  
2 = moderate (definite elevation but not thick)  
3 = severe (definite elevation, thick plaque with sharp edge)  
4 = very severe (very thick plaque with sharp edge)  
Scaliness  
0 = none  (no scaling)  
1 = mild (sparse, fine scale, lesions only partially covered)  
2 = moderate (coarser scales, most of lesions covered)  
3 = severe (entire lesion covered with coarse scales)  
4 = very severe (very thick coarse scales, possibly fissured)  
PASI:  
The following formula will be used to calculate the m -PASI:  
Arms 0.2 (R + T + S)E = X  
Trunk 0.3 (R + T + S)E = Y  
Legs 0.4 (R + T + S)E = Z  
Where: R = score for redness; T = score for thickness; S = score for scaliness; E = score fo r 
extent.  
The sum of X + Y  + Z gives the m -PASI which can range from 0 to 64.8.  
8.16.4  Investigator ’s Assessment of the Body Surface Area (BSA) 
Involvement of Psoriasis Vulgaris on Trunk and Limbs  
From baseline (Visit 1), and at all monthly visits during the maintenance phase, as well  as all 
unscheduled visits , the (sub)investigator will assess the extent of the  subject ’s psoriatic 
involvement on the trunk and limbs. The total psoriatic involvement on the  trunk and limbs 
(excluding skin folds and genitals) will be recorded as a percentage  of the  total BSA, 
estimating that the surface of the subject ’s full, flat palm  (including the five digits) correlates 
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 75 of 176 
to approximately 1% of the total BSA. The purpose of  this is to obtain an estimate of the area 
on the trunk and limbs to be treated with trial medication.  
8.16.5  Investigator ’s Assessment of the Severity of the Target Lesion /Target 
Location  (Redness, Thickness, Scaliness)  
At Visit 1 (baseline) , the (sub)investigator will select a target lesion /target location . The target 
lesion /location  should be at least [ADDRESS_136292] axis  located on the body (i.e., not on the 
scalp, face or intertrigious areas) . The l ocation will be recorded in the eCRF as trunk, limb 
excluding elbow/knee, elbow or knee, and in more detail in the subject medical records to 
allow identification of the target lesion /location  at subsequent visits.  
From baseline (Visit 1), and at all  monthly visits during the maintenance phase, as well  as all 
unscheduled visits , the (sub)investigator will assess the severity of the target lesio n/location  
for each clinical sign (redness, thickness, scaliness) according to the same scale as for the 
Investigator ’s Assessment of the Severity of Clin ical Signs ( redness, thickness, scaliness). At 
Visit 1, the scoring of the  target lesion /location  should be at least [ADDRESS_136293] 4 in total  (see section  8.16.3  for score s).

9 Adverse Events  
Adverse events and serious adverse events are defined in Appendix 4: Definitions
of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Classification of AEs in terms of severity, causality and outcome  are defined in
Appendix 5: Classification of Adverse Events .
TMF-[ADDRESS_136295] has signed the informed c onsen t form until the FU3 visit . Refer to 
section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for a definition of rebound.  
Abnormal findings observed at the screening visit should be recorded as diagnoses in the 
Concomitant Medication page if medi cation is currently being taken for the condition. If not, 
it will be documented as medical history in the eCRF.  
AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_82048] . 
At all visits  during the treatment phases , the subject will be asked a non -leading quest ion by 
[CONTACT_941] (sub)investigator about AEs, for example: “How have you felt since I saw you last? ” No 
specific symptoms should be asked for. It is important that the (sub)investigator also obser ves 
the subject for any changes not reported by [CONTACT_121577].  
9.1.1 Application site reactions : Assessment of local safety and tolerability  
Application site reactions ( perilesional erythema, oedema, dryness,  erosion  and burning and 
pain)  which match the criteria in the Local Safety and Tolerability Scale  (see Section 8.11) are 
not to be reported as AEs in the eCRF even if they require treatment. Application site 
reactions  other than those identified in the Local Safety and Tolerability scale must be 
recorded appropriately as AEs.  Any application site reaction  classified as SAEs must be added 
to the AE form in the eCRF and in addition  reported to LEO on the SAE Form (according to 
“Investigator Reporting Respons ibilities ”, Section 9.4.1 ). Any treatment for an application site 
reaction  must be recorded on the concomitant medication page of the eCRF . 
9.[ADDRESS_136296] or observed by [CONTACT_941] (sub)investigator  must be recorded on the AE 
form of the eCRF and should be described in the following manner:  
The AE term  will be in precise English medical terminology (i.e. not necessaril y the exact 
words used by [CONTACT_423]). Whenever possible, a specific diagnosis should be stated (e.g. 
allergic contact [CONTACT_8748]).  
For cutaneous AEs the location  must be part of the AE descr iption and may be described as 
e.g. the face, scalp, back, ches t, arm, leg, trunk or limb .
Additionally, the location  should be described  using the following terminology: 
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 77 of 176 
Lesional/perilesional (≤ 2 cm from the area(s)  treated with IPs) or
distant (>2 cm from the area(s) treated )
The duration  of the AE must  be reported as the start date and stop date of the event.  In 
addition, it  must  be recorded whether the AE started prior to start of trial medication.  
AEs must be classified in terms of severity, causality and outcome according to the definitions 
in Appendix 5: Classification of Adverse Events . 
9.2.1 Additional requirements for reporting of adverse events of concern 
associated with long -term topi[INVESTIGATOR_121497] e 
If the (sub)investigator consider s an AE to be one of concern associated with long -term 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_121464], this should be indicated in the AE section of the eCRF, and will 
require a detailed narrative of the AE to be entered , including a description of the clinical 
course, the area(s) affected if a cutaneous event (body location and approximate size), and 
predisposing concomitant con ditions, medications, or history.  
If LEO suspects that an AE may be one of concern associated w ith long -term topi[INVESTIGATOR_121498] , LEO may ask the (sub) investigator to provide additional information.  
The purpose of collecting these additional data is to provide as much information as possible 
on suspected events in order to aid the adjudicati on of events by [CONTACT_121578].  
9.2.2 Actions T aken as a Consequence of an AE  
Action taken with trial treatment:  Any action taken with trial medication  as a consequence of 
the AE must  be recorded (dose not changed, drug interrupted, drug withdrawn, not a pplicable, 
unknown).  
Note regarding AEs of concer n associated with long -term corticosteroid use:  A 
(sub)investigator may consider an AE to be one of concern associated with long -term topi[INVESTIGATOR_121499].  Such a change in trial medication usage may apply to just 
the area(s) affected by [CONTACT_84561], or its total use.  Such a change in trial medication usage must 
be documented in the eCRF.  
Other action taken:  Any other action taken as a result of the AE must  be recorded  (none, 
concomitant med ication, concurrent procedure).  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 78 of 176

9.3.6 Aggravation of Condition  
Any clinically significant aggravation/exacerbation/worsening of any medical condition(s), 
compared to basel ine, must be reported as an AE.  
Relapse of psoriasis  during the maintenance phase of the trial  or during the follow -up phase 
should not be reported as an AE. Rebound effect (defined as (i) an m -PASI ≥12 AND an 
increase in m -PASI of ≥125% of the baseline value, or (ii) new pustular, erythrodermic or 
more inflammatory psoriasis either a) within 2 months after discontinuation of once -daily 
treatment in the initial open -label phase, b) within 2 months after discontinuation of once -
daily relapse treatment, or c) within 2 months after end of maintenance treatment (up to Visit 
FU3) ) must be reported as an AE.

such as anonymised reports of diagnostic procedures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], autopsy reports, etc.  
Additionally, GPV, LEO  may request further information in order to fu lly assess the SAE. The 
(sub)investigator  must forward such information to GPV, LEO  upon request by [CONTACT_3719] e -mail 
(see contact [CONTACT_73322] ).  
The investigator must  notify the local IRB(s)/IEC(s) of SAEs as required by [CONTACT_121579] t he concerned country.  
SAEs occurring after the completion of the clinical trial (including any protocol required post -
treatment follow -up period ) should not be routinely sought or collected. However, such events 
should be reported to GPV , LEO (drug.safety@leo -pharma.com ) if the (sub)investigator  
becomes aware of them.  
9.4.2 LEO  Reporting Responsibilities  
GPV, LEO  is responsible for assessing whether or not a SAE is expected. The relevant 
reference document  for this clinical trial  is:  
LEO [ZIP_CODE] aerosol foam: the LEO [ZIP_CODE] Investigator's Brochure, edition 7 (11) and

During the initial open -label  treatment phase , subj ects will be asked to apply
LEO [ZIP_CODE] once daily on the affected areas on trunk and limbs for 4 weeks. At
Visit 2 (after 4 weeks) , subject s will have to return all containers with trial
medication and , if they have achieved treatment success (PGA score of ‘clear ’ or
‘almost clear ’ with at least a 2 -grade improvement from baseline) , they  will be
dispensed new (blinded) medication according to the randomi sation scheme.

During the maintenance phase, subjects will appl y maintenance IP  twice  weekly on
trunk and limbs to areas where lesions h ave cleared or almost cleared after
treatment was initiated at baseline. Any new psoriatic lesions  that have been cleared
by [CONTACT_121581]. The treatment should  be applied 3 or 4 days ap art. The choice of the
application days (two days) should be left to subject s’ preference (e.g., Thursday
and Sunday); these days will be fixed at Visit [ADDRESS_136313] every week on the
selected application days.
Following confirmation of a relapse  during the maintenance phase , subjects will be
asked to apply rescue IP once daily on  the active psoriatic lesions  on trunk and
limbs  for [ADDRESS_136314] attended  Visit 1 . The IPs will be 
dispensed by a designat ed person. As described above, there will be different types  of  
instruction s for in itial open -label, mai ntenanc e and relapse treatment p hases . Subjects will 
always be reminded which instruction(s) to follow during the next 4 -week period.  
When an application is to be administered on the same day as a trial visit, it should not be 
administered within 2 hours of the site visit.  
Missed application  during the maintenance phase : 
LEO [ADDRESS_136315] remembers . The 
next application  should be made  at the next scheduled dosing date.       
10.3 Precautions/Overdosage  
Overdose with calcipotriol may be associated with hypercalcaemi a. Clinically important 
hypercalcaemia will be managed at the investigator ’s discretion with rehydration, 
bisphosphonate administration or according to local standard of care. Hypercalcaemia should 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_82010].  
TMF-[ADDRESS_136316] will receive the necessary supplies 
for 4 weeks (7 cans of LEO [ZIP_CODE]) . These cans  will be dispensed at Visit 1.  
Then , every 4 weeks during the maintenance phase subjects will receive the necessary 
supplies (3 cans of maintenance IP ), which is sufficient for the visit inter val when used twice 
per week. These kits will be dispensed at each scheduled visit  until the end of  the trial.   
In total, at least [ADDRESS_136317] over the duration of the t rial (7 cans 
will be dispense d at Visit 1 , and 3 cans will be dispensed  at each visit  from Visit 2 to Visit 14 ). 
In addition, in case of relapse  during the maintenance phase, the subject  will receive the 
necessary supplies ( 7 cans of rescue IP ) to be treated once daily on the active lesions for 4 
weeks.  
During relapse treatment subjects may also be in maintenance treatment on areas where 
psoriasis is not active . To distinguish the rescue IP  from the maintenance  IP, the products are 
colour coded as follows:  
Open -label (initial or rescue) IP: yellow  labels
Double -blind (maintenance) IP: white  labels
The l abelling  of trial products must  be in accordance with Annex 13, local regulations and 
trial requirements . 
Immediate Treatment Packaging - Individual Unit  
The primary packaging for the IPs  consists of an  aluminium can into which the formulation is 
pre-filled and subsequently administered  through  a continuous valve. Each individual can 
contains [ADDRESS_136318] be stored  in a secure and restricted area under the conditions 
specified on the label and remain in the original container until dispensed .  
Furthermore, the following storage conditions and handling precautions should be observed:  
For U nited States:  
Store at 20 -25 °C. Excursions between 15 -30°C permitted .
Contents under pressure. Do not puncture or incinerate.
Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120°F (49°C). Do not freeze.
Flammable – avoid heat, flame or smoking when using this product.
Keep out of the reach of children.
Shake before use.
Wash hands after use .
For other countries : 
Store below 30°C.
Extremely flammable aerosol.
Pressurised container: May burst if heated.
Protect from sunlight.
Do not expose to temperatures exceeding 50°C.
Do not pi[INVESTIGATOR_82011], even after use.
Do not spray on an open flame or other ignition source.
Keep away from sparks, open flames and other ignition sources.
No smoking.
Keep out of the reach of children.
Shake before use.
Wash hands after use.
TMF-[ADDRESS_136319] been found to comply with all the inclusion  criteria and not to violate any 
of the exclusion criteria , and who achieve treatment success (PGA score of ‘clear ’ or ‘almost 
clear ’ with at least a 2 -grade improvement from baseline) after the initial 4 week of once daily 
treatment with LEO [ZIP_CODE]  will be randomised to receive treatment with either : 
LEO [ZIP_CODE] aerosol foam  (also referred to as ‘LEO [ZIP_CODE]’)
Aerosol foam vehicle  (also referred to as ‘foam vehicle ’)
Treatment assignment will be pre -planned according to a computer generated randomisation 
schedule in a 1:1 ratio.  
Subjects will be randomis ed centrally to treatment with LEO [ZIP_CODE] aerosol foam or LEO  
[ZIP_CODE] aerosol foam vehicle using a stratified randomi sation through an Interactive Web 
Response System (IWRS).  
Each investigator site will be supplied with sufficient trial products for the trial on an ongoing 
basis controlled by [CONTACT_8784] . Randomisation  will be stratified by [CONTACT_121562] , HPA axis testing,  
and by [CONTACT_22789]  (mild, moderate, severe) .  
The maximum number  of subjects to be included in the open -label phase with ‘mild’ disease 
according to the PGA at baseline (visit 1) is capped at 20% to ensure similar distribution of 
disease severity at baseline as in  previous LEO [ADDRESS_136320] and administration of the clinical trial until the clinical trial is unblin ded.

10.7  Drug Accountability and Compliance Checks  
10.7.1  Drug Accountability  
The investigator is fully responsible for the IP at the trial site  and for maintaining adequate 
control of the IP and for documenting all transactions with them.  
Dispensing of IP may be delegated, e.g. to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601] , as locally applicable.  
At each visit, the IP, including (empty) containers dispensed at the previous visit , must be 
returned by [CONTACT_423].  An inventory (Indiv idual Drug Accountability Form)  must  be kept of 
the IP given to and returned by [CONTACT_121582]. This inventory must be 
available for inspection during monitoring visits and will be checked by [CONTACT_121583]. 
All IP supplied by [CONTACT_82058] ( CMO) on behalf of LEO  must  
be ret urned to the CMO. Prior to  their return, they must  be fully accounted for by [CONTACT_121584]. Accountability must  be 
documented by [CONTACT_121585].  
The IP returned to the CMO will be  reconciled with the Individual Drug Accountability 
Forms. All returned cans will subsequently be  weighed by [CONTACT_121586] . 
10.7.[ADDRESS_136321] Destruction  
Used and unused trial products will be destroyed by [CONTACT_8888] O according to LEO procedures.  
10.7.3  Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be recorded in an eDiary .  
During the open -label treatment phase, subjects will be asked to provide this information 
daily whereas treatment compliance will be recorded weekly during the entire maintenance 
phase  (i.e., from Visit 2/W eek [ADDRESS_136322] is on 
maintenance or once daily treatment) . 
In case of non -compliance, the reason for it should be recorded  in the e Diary. 
However, the (sub)investigator  should  remind the subject of the importance of following the 
instructions given including taking t he trial medication as prescribed  for respective phase of 
the trial .

‘clear ’ or ‘almost cle ar’ with at least 2 -grade improvement from baseline)  at the end of the  
open -label treatment phase, the subject is randomised. Otherwise the subject is discontinued 
from the trial. The second treatment period is denoted the maintenance phase. It starts at 
randomisation and ends at end of trial. The randomised  maintenance  treatment is twice 
weekly treatment with either LEO [ZIP_CODE] aerosol foam or LEO [ZIP_CODE] aerosol foam vehicle. 
Moreover, the subjecs treated twice weekly with LEO [ZIP_CODE] aerosol foam is referred t o as the 
active treatment group and those treated twice weekly with vehicle is referred to as the veh icle 
group.  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 95 of 176 
Note that the maintenance phase consists of maintenance treatment as well as periods of 4 
weeks treatment with rescue medication in case of re lapse.  
In the following when refer ring to visit it means scheduled visit although not explicity stated. 
11.1 Determination of Sample Size  
For subjects with psoriasis vulgaris, the number of relapses per year is assumed to be between 
4 and 8. We assume that th e time to event (first relapse) is a Poisson process, i.e. that events 
occur continuously and independently at a constant rate. Then the time between events is 
given by [CONTACT_121589]. Time to event is analysed by [CONTACT_121590] ,  which can be thought of as the probability of experiencing an event now if you have 
not experienced one already. Table 16 shows the mean and median waiting times as well as 
hazards according to number of relapses per year.  
Table 16: Mean and median waiting times and hazards according to n umber of relapses 
per year  
Number of relapses per year

Mean waiting time (weeks)  13.00  8.67 6.50 
Median waiting time (weeks)  9.[ADDRESS_136328]  0.077  0.115  0.154  
The drop -out rate observed in a long -term trial with calc ipotriol/BDP ointment 
(MCB  0102  INT) was about 30 % over [ADDRESS_136329] ratio of 0.7 for active treatment group relative to vehicle group, between 178 and 19 0 
subjects per group are needed in order to obtain a power of  90% for a 5% significance level . 
Thus, 380 subjects should be randomised.  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 96 of 176 
In previous trials in similar populations, approximately 48% subjects treated with LEO [ZIP_CODE] 
aerosol foam achieved treatment success  after 4 weeks of treatment.  Assuming a binomial 
distribution with 48 % probability of success it is estimated that [ADDRESS_136330] 90 % probability of achieving at least [ADDRESS_136331] been exposed for 4 weeks during the open -label treatment 
phase . During the maintenance phase w ith 380 randomised subjects, assuming an exponential 
decline and a drop -out rate of 30 % over [ADDRESS_136332] 
326 subjects exposed for a total of 26 weeks, and 273 subjects exposed for a total of 
52 weeks.  
If the actual  drop-out rate is higher than the assumed drop -out rate  of 30%, more subjects will 
be recruited and ran domised to achieve at least [ADDRESS_136333]  100 subje cts (including approximately 
25 subjects undergoing HPA axis testing) with 52 weeks of exposure.  
Recruitment will be stopped when a sufficient number of subjects are randomised in order to 
obtain the above, considering the observed randomisation and drop -out rates . 
11.2 Definition of Trial Analysis Sets  
All subjects enrolled in the trial (i.e. subjects for whom informed consent has been obtained 
and who have been registered in the clinical trial) will be accounted for in the clinical trial 
report.  
An open -label treatment phase safety analysis set will be defined by [CONTACT_121591].   
All subjects randomised are included in the full analysis set and will be analysed for efficacy. 
Exclusions from the full analysis set can be considered in special cases as described in  
International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) E9, section 5.2.1., Full Analysis Set. If it is 
decided to exclude a randomised subject from the full analysis set, a justification addressing 
ICH E9 will be given.  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 97 of 176 
A per protocol analys is set will be defined by [CONTACT_121592]:  
receive no treatment with the IPs after randomisation,
provide no efficacy data following start of maintenance treatment,
are known to have taken the wrong IPs throughout the ma intenance phase of the
trial,
and/or do not fulfil the disease defining inclusion criteria (i.e. inclusion criteria  4, 5,
6, 7).
Further exclusion of subjects or subject data will be decided upon after a blind review of t he 
data, reviewing all the remaining in - and exclusion criteria, but focusing on concomitant 
medication that may affect psoriasis vulgaris and also considering compliance/adherence and 
violations of visit windows.  
A maintenance phase safety analysis set will be defined by [CONTACT_121593]/or for 
whom no post -randomisation safety evaluations are available.  
The decisions regarding inclusion/exclusion of subjects and/or subject data from t he trial 
analysis sets will be documented in the statistical analysis plan update before breaking the  
randomisation code.

11.3.2  Demographics and other Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive statistics of demographics and other baseline characteristics measured at baseline 
will be presented both for all subjects included in the trial , and for all randomised subjects by 
[CONTACT_1570] . Presentations of age, sex, ethnicity, race and baseline m-PASI and PGA will 
also be given by [CONTACT_82064].  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 98 of 176 
Demographics include age, sex, race and ethnicity. Other baseline characteristics include sk in 
type, height, weight, body mass index  and vital signs, duration of psoriasis vulgaris, 
concurrent diagnoses  (from medical history and indications for concomitant medication), 
concomitant medication, previous anti -psoriatic therapy, m-PASI, physician ’s assessment of 
BSA involved, location of psoriasis, location of other psoriasis, and PGA.  
11.3.3  Exposure and Treatmen t Compliance  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exposure  
The duration of exposure to treatment in a specific visit interval will be calculated as the  
number of days from date of first application of IP in that period to the date of last application 
of IP in that period, both days included.  
Duration of exposure during the open -label treatment phase  will be summarized for the open -
label treatment phase  safety analysis set.  
Duration of exposure during the maintenance phase will be summarized by [CONTACT_121594].  
For each subject, the weight of IP used for each visit interval will be determined by 
[CONTACT_121595] a set of full cans dispensed and the weight  of 
the returned cans.  
The amount of IP used will be summarise d for the total open -label treatment phase  for the 
open -label treatment phase  safety analysis set.   
The amount of IP used will be summarised by [CONTACT_121596].  
The amount of rescue medication used will be summarised by [CONTACT_121597].  
The total amount of IP and rescue medication used will be sum marised by [CONTACT_121598].

LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 99 of 176 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment compliance  
For the open -label treatment p hase, compliance with treatment instructions in terms of 
percentage mis sed applications will be summarised for the open -label treatment phase  safety 
analysis set.   
For the maintenance phase, excluding periods of treatment with rescue medication, 
compliance with treatment instructions in terms of percentage missed application s will be 
summarised by [CONTACT_121599].  
For the periods of treatment with rescue medication during the maintenance phase, 
compliance with treat ment instructions in terms of percentage missed applications will be 
summarised by [CONTACT_121600].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint  is time to first relapse during the maintenance p hase, where relapse is 
an exacerbation of psoriasis defined as a PGA of at least ‘mild’. This will be calculated as  the 
number of days from randomisation to the day where the subject has the first relapse 
confirmed. For subjects who either do not encounter  a relapse or are withdrawn from the trial, 
the number of days will be treated as a censored observation at the day of end of trial visi t. 
The number of censored and uncensored observations, i.e. number of subjects without relapse  
or who are withdrawn from  the trial,  and number of subjects with relapse, will be summarised 
by [CONTACT_1570]. The time to first relapse will be summarised by [CONTACT_121601], i.e. subjects with relapse.  
The primary endpoint will be compared between treatments with the null hypothesis that they 
are equal against the alternative that they are different. The analysis will be performed both 
for the full analysis set (primary) and for the per protocol analysis set (supportive). The 
comparison will be done  using a proportional hazards model with treatment group, trial site , 
and disease severity at baseline (as determined by [CONTACT_121602]) as factors. The estimate of the 
hazard ratio of active treatment group relative to vehicle group together with the 95% 
confide nce interval and p -value will be presented.  
The estimated survival curves with confidence intervals will be presented graphically for ea ch 
of the treatment groups.  Moreover the percentiles of the survivial distribution will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_39815] p. 
TMF-[ADDRESS_136335] relapse will be compared betwee n 
the two treatment groups at 26 and 52  weeks after randomisation .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints will be analysed for the ful l analysis set, with the analysis for the per 
protocol analysis set being supportive. Adjustment for multiplicity will be done using the 
Holm -Bonferroni method ( 34).   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Number of days in remission  
The number of days in remission will be calculated for each subject as the total number of 
days in trial during the maintenance period minus the number of days in treatment of relapse s, 
if any. If a subject is withdrawn from the trial for any reason, then the subject is considered 
not to be in remission from when the subject leaves the trial.  
The number of days in remission will be summarised by [CONTACT_1570]. 
The number of days in remission will be analysed by [CONTACT_121603] 
(ANOVA) model with treatment group, trial site, and disease severity at baseline as factors. 
Estimated difference between active treatment group and vehicle group, 95% confidence 
interval, and p -value wi ll be presented.  
In addition, two sensitivity analyses will be performed with different handling of missing 
data. If a subject is withdrawn from the trial for a drug related reason (lack of efficacy, AE, 
did not reach remission after treatment of relapse) then in both sensitivity analyses the subject 
is considered not to be in remission from when the subject leaves the trial. If a subject is 
withdrawn from the trial for a non -drug related reason (lost to follow -up, death, other) then 
the data is imputed dif ferently in the two sensitivity analyses. During the blind review of the 
data the withdrawal reasons specified in the ‘Other ’ category should be considered and if th e 
specified reason is judged to be drug -related it should be documented in the statistical analysis 
plan before breaking the randomisation code.  
In the first sensitivity analysis, the subject ’s observed part of the maintenance phase is 
assumed to be representative for the unobserved part of the maintenance phase when the 
subject is withdrawn due  to a non -drug related reason. I.e. if the subject is in remission in [ADDRESS_136336] ’s last observation is carried forward (LOCF)  
when the subject is withdrawn due to a non -drug-related reason. I.e. if the subject is in 
remission the subjec t is considered to be in remission for the rest of the maintenance phase, 
and if the subject is not in remission, then subject is considered not to be in remission for the 
rest of the maintenance phase.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Number of relapses during maintenance phase  
The numb er of relapses will be calculated as the sum of confirmed relapses for each subject. 
Subjects contribute with observed time only. The rate of relapses during the maintenance 
phase is ass umed to be constant over time.  
The number of relapses will be analyse d in a Poisson regression model with treatment group, 
trial site, and disease severity at baseline as factors, subject as a random effect,  and risk time 
as an offset. The risk time is the observed time at risk for each subject, i.e. the total time in 
trial during the maintenance p hase time minus the periods of treatment of relapses, if any. The 
estimated incidence rate ratio for active treatment group relative to vehicle group with 95%  
confidence interval and p -value will be presented.  
A sensitivity analy sis will be performed where subjects  who at some point do not achieve 
‘clear ’ or ‘almost clear ’ after treatment of a relapse are excluded.  
11.3.4  Exploratory Analysis of Efficacy  
All exploratory analyses of efficacy will be analyzed for the full analysis set. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  m-PASI  
m-PASI will be summarised by [CONTACT_3232].
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subjects in remission at each visit  
The number of subjects in remission at each visit will be summarised by [CONTACT_1570]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Time to when PASI75 is no longer fulfilled  
PASI75 will be based on the m -PASI which is calculated based on the Physician ’s assessment 
of the extent and severity of the disease locally (trunk, arms and legs) as described in section 
8.16.[ADDRESS_136337] 75% reduction in the modified PASI from baseline. 
TMF-[ADDRESS_136338] ratio of active treatment group 
relative to vehicle group together with the 95% c onfidence interval and p -value will be 
presented.  
The estimated survival curves with confidence intervals will be presented graphically for ea ch 
of the treatment groups.   
The proportion of subjects who are still at risk of not fulfilling PASI75 will be co mpared 
between the two treatment groups at 26 and 52  weeks after randomisation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Time to first relapse according to m -PASI  
Relapse according to m -PASI is included in this study in order to be able to compare with 
other studies where this definition is used.  Relapse according to m -PASI occurs when the m -
PASI level exceeds the relapse according to m -PASI level. The relapse according to m -PASI 
level is defined as the baseline m -PASI value minus 50% of the reduction in m -PASI obtained 
from the baseline visit to the randomi sation visit [ADDRESS_136339] relapse according to m -PASI will be done 
using a proportional hazards model with treatment group, tria l site, and disease severity at 
baseline as factors. The estimated survival curves with confidence intervals will be present ed 
graphically for  each of the treatment groups.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy after treatment of relapse  
The proportion of subjects who obtain clear  or almost clear after treatment of relapse will be 
summarised by [CONTACT_121604] (1st, 2nd, 3rd etc) for each treatment group.

The target lesion/location scores will be summarised over time by [CONTACT_1570].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Body Surface Ar ea (BSA)  
The affected BSA will be summarised over time by [CONTACT_1570].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Number of active treatment days during maintenance phase  
The number of active treatment days during the maintenance phase will be presented for each 
treatment group.  
For the active  treatment group, it is the sum of days where treated with maintenance treatment 
(twice weekly) and days where treated with rescue medication (once daily during relapse).   
For the vehicle group, it is the sum of days where treated with rescue medication ( once daily 
during relapse).  
11.3.5  Analysis of Patient -Reported Outcomes 
All patient -reported outcomes will be analysed for the full analysis set  for the maintenance 
phase and for the open -label treatment phase safety analysis set for the open -label treatment 
phase.

with the trial treatment if started after the first application of IP or (applicable if the re is a 
wash -out) if started before the first use of IP and worsened in severity thereafter.  The 
tabulations described in the following will only include the events that are emergent with trial 
treatment. In each of the tabulations, AEs are defined by [CONTACT_121607] . 
An overall summary of the number (percentage) of subjects with any treatment emergent AEs, 
SAEs, premature discontinuations from the trial due to AEs, treatment related AEs and severe  
AEs will be presented.  
The numbe r of AEs and the number of subjects experiencing each type of AEs will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]. The percentage of subjects with AEs will be compared between 
treatment groups by a chi -square test or Fisher ’s exact test (if expected cell count < 5).  
The severity for each type of AE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]..  
The causal relationship to trial medication for each type of AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6490].  
Related AEs are defined as AEs for which the (sub)investigator has not described  the causal 
relationship to IPs as ‘not related ’. The number of related AEs and the number of subjects 
TMF-[ADDRESS_136342] or Fisher ’s exact 
test (if expected cell count < 5).  
The above tabulations will be done for the total maintenance phase, for the first 28 weeks o f 
the maintenance phase, and for the remaining 24 weeks of the maintenance phase separately. 
An AE will be included in the tabulations by [CONTACT_121608]. If an AE is ongoing at Visit 2 or 
Visit 9 and worsened in severity after, the AE will be included in the tabulations of both 
affected periods.  
SAEs  will be evaluated separately and a narrative for each w ill be given.  
AEs leading to withdrawal from trial or discontinuation of IPs will be listed. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_136343] been judged by [CONTACT_121609].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rebound  
Rebound will be defined as (i) an m -PASI ≥12 AND an increase in m -PASI of ≥125% of the 
baseline value, or (ii) new pustular, erythrodermic or more inflammatory psoriasis either a) 
within 2 months after discontinuation of once -daily treatment in the initia l open -label phase, 
b) within 2  months  after discontinuation of once -daily re lapse treatment, or c) within
2 months after end of maintenance treatment (up to Visit FU3)
Number of rebounds within two months after entering the maintenance phase will be 
summari sed by [CONTACT_121610] a table.  
Number of rebounds occurring after the first two months of maintenance treatment (i.e. 
including the follow -up period) will be summari sed by [CONTACT_121611].  
Subjects with m -PASI ≥125% of baseline (Visit1) score and c ases of rebound will be listed . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local safety and tolerability 
The local safety and tolerabil ity signs perilesional erythema, perilesional oedema, perilesional 
dryness, and perilesional erosion, as well as the symptom ‘application site burning or pain ’ 
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0

will be summarised over time  both for the open -label treatment phase, and for the 
maintenance ph ase by [CONTACT_1570] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  ACTH -Challenge test  
For the group of subjects undergoing the ACTH -challenge test, the number of subjects with 
serum cortisol concentration values ≤18 mcg/dl [ADDRESS_136344] will  
be summarised over time by [CONTACT_64240].    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs and Physical Findings  
The change in vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) from baseline to en d 
of treatment phase will be summarised.  
The change in vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature ) from randomisation to 
end of trial will be summarised.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Evaluation  
The change in each of the laboratory parameters from baseline to end of open -label treatment 
phase will be summarised as mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum values.  
The change in each of the laboratory parameters from randomisation to end of trial will be 
summarised as mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum values for each treatment group.  
Laboratory parameters will be classified as ‘low’, ‘normal ’ or ‘high’, depending  on whether 
the value is below, within or above the reference range, respectively.  
A shift table will be produced showing the categories at baseline against those at end of 
treatment period.  
A shift table will be produced showing the categories at randomis ation against those at end of 
trial. 
To identify subjects with clinically important laboratory changes in albumin -corrected serum 
calcium levels, LEO has defined threshold levels for concern for a clinically significant 
change based on the CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_136345] ‘moderate ’ (i.e. at least 2 o n a 
5-point scale) according to the CTCAE v4.0. The low threshold level for the albumin -
corrected serum calciu m is ‘<2.0 mmol/l ’ and the high threshold level is ‘>2.9 mmol/l ’.
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 108 of 176 
Additional  shift tables as described above will be produced for clinically significant valu es of 
albumin corrected serum calcium as defined by [CONTACT_82093], i.e., <2.0 mmol/l (lowthreshold) or >2.9  
mmol/l (high threshold), i.e. the shift tales will be for subjects with at least one clinically 
significant value of albumin corrected serum calcium. .  
Subjects with laboratory parameters outside the reference range will be listed.  
11.3.[ADDRESS_136346] of the study nor the interpretation of the results as th e open -label 
treatment p hase is not blinded.  
11.3.8  General Principles  
All significance tests will be two -sided using the 5% significance level. All confidence 
intervals will be presented with 95% degree of confidence.  
An observed cases approach will be used for  tabulations of data by [CONTACT_765] (i.e. involving only 
those subjects who attended each specific visit).  
Categorical data will be summarised using the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category and treatment group. Continuous data will be summarised using the mean, median, 
standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum values.  
All the analyses specified in the protocol will be reviewed in relation to the blinded data 
actually obtained and the statistical analysis plan update will be finalised before bre aking the 
randomisation code.  
The randomi sation is stratified by [CONTACT_1570], trial site,  HPA axis testing and disease 
severity at baseline as factors . Usually, the statistical analysis of efficacy parameters takes all 
the stratification factors into a ccount. However, the HPA axis test is a safety parameter , which 
is only determined at a small subset of sites and subjects . Hence stratification by [CONTACT_121612]. Also, i t is expected that two subjects per site will  be rando mised. 
This means that a statistical model having HPA axis testing  as a factor may not converge, 
depending on whether subjects participating in the HPA axis test drop out. Furthermore, the 
inclusion criteria for participating in the HPA axis test are “Mode rate” or “Severe ” in the 
baseline PGA assessment and a baseline BSA between 10 and 30 %. Including the 
stratification factor HPA axis testing would therefore introduce a confounding with the 
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP005 3-1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 109 of 176 
stratification according to baseline PGA  as well as sites . Therefore  the stratification 
according to HPA axis testing  is not included  in the statistical analyses . 
Any changes from the statistical analysis planned in this clinical trial protocol will be 
described and justified in a protocol amendment/the statistica l analysis plan update and/or in 
the clinical trial report dependent on the type of deviation.  
11.3.[ADDRESS_136347] leaves the trial. Two sensitivity analyses with different 
imputation as detailed in section [IP_ADDRESS]  are performed.  
For the secondary endpoint “number of relapses ”, subjects only contribute with information 
until they leave the trial.     
There is no imputation of missing data for the exploratory analyses of  efficacy and the 
analyses of patient -reported outcomes.  
[ADDRESS_136348] (“Adjudication Panel ”) will review all 
treatment -emergent  AEs to identify AEs of concern associated with long -term use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_121508] a causal  relationship between the trial medication and the event is at 
least a reasonable possibilit y. 
The Adjudication Panel will not review AEs which occurred prior to applicatio n of the first 
dose of IP; this includes AEs reported by [CONTACT_121613] (who per definition did not sta rt 
open -label treatment).  
The Adjud ication Panel Members (AP M) will be independent of the trial  (i.e. they will not be  
participating  (sub)investigat ors) and of LEO (i.e. they will not be LEO employees).  They will  
also be blinded to treatment allocation at the time of the review.  
A listing of AEs will be provide d to the APM consisting of the following data:  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 110 of 176 
AE reported Term (as reported in eCRF) .
The M edDRA Preferred Term as coded by [CONTACT_82093].
The (sub)investigator assessment of causal relationship of the use of trial medication
to the event, location of cutaneous events , severity,  and seriousness.
The (sub)investigator assessment of causal relationship of l ong-term use of
corticosteroids to the event. For such AEs of concern, the narrative recorded in the
eCRF will also be provided.
The date of onset, the outcome, and date of outcome .
The action taken with trial medication .
The listing w ill be  generated for patients with complete data  (i.e. source data verification  
(SDV)  and SAE reconciliation have been performed) . Several listings w ill be generated 
during the trial and adjudications performed on batches of ‘complete ’ patients, until all 
patien ts are included in this process.  
The APM will be able to request eCRF pages and SAE reports on a per subject basis, should 
this be required for adjudication purposes.  
Each APM will pe rform the adjudication independently of the other APMs  and of LEO .  If 
there is any discrepancies in the events identified by [CONTACT_121614], the APMs will discuss these, 
either by [CONTACT_116622] a meeting.   If a consensus opi[INVESTIGATOR_121509],  a conservative approach will be used by [CONTACT_121615] , even if identified by [CONTACT_121616].  
The Clinical Project  Manager ( CPM )/National Lead Clinical Research Associate ( NLCRA ) is 
present at the time of adjudication to provide administr ative support only; The CPM /NLCRA 
will not make any comments in relation to the adjudication of the AEs. 
13 Case Report Form s and Data Handling  
13.1 Case Report Forms (CRFs)   
Data will be  collected by [CONTACT_82081] ( EDC). The investigator or staff 
authorised by [CONTACT_121617]. Data reco rded in the e CRFs 
will be accessible to the trial site and LEO personnel  immediately after entry. The eCRFs 
must be maintained  in an up -to-date state at the trial site  at all times.  
The investigator must verify the correctness of the data entered by [CONTACT_121618]. Th is signature [CONTACT_121654]-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 111 of 176 
cannot be altered. Any correction(s) made by [CONTACT_941] (sub) investigator or authorised site staff to 
the eCRF after original entry will be  documented in the audit trail. Changes to data already 
approved will require  the re -signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_093]. The person making the change  to 
the data,  and the date, time and reason for the change will be  identified in the audit trail.  
For archiving purposes, each investigator will be supplied with a copy of the  eCRFs for all 
subjects enrolled at the trial site . This is done after completion of the trial and bef ore access to 
the eCRF is revoked . Audit trail information will be included.  eCRFs must  be available for 
inspection by [CONTACT_121619] , from regulatory authorities and/or 
IEC/IRBs.  
13.[ADDRESS_136349] data should be entered into the eCRF as soon as possible after the visit in accordan ce 
with the time requirements described in the Clinical Trial Agreement with the sites. Queries  
for discrepant data may be generated automatically by [CONTACT_121620] n entry or generated 
manually by [CONTACT_121621]. All queries, whether generated by [CONTACT_121622] a user, will be in an electronic format. This systematic validation will ensure  that 
a clean and consistent database is provided prio r to the statistical analysis being performed.  
Some PRO data will be captured electronically on a tablet/slate (ePRO) at the site. Other PR O 
data as well as some compliance questions will be captured on a small tablet (eDiary) by [CONTACT_121623].  By [CONTACT_121624], including the clinical 
investigator, with read access only. The investigator (or designee) is expected to review ePRO 
and eDia ry data, and remind and re -train the subject if appropriate to ensure data 
completeness . The ePRO  and eDiary  system is a separate application from the eCRF . Data 
captured from the eCRF will be stored on a different servers than data captured via ePRO and 
eDiary during data capture. Data from both systems will be included in the final study 
database . 
External data transfers from vendors to LEO will be transmitted and handled via a secure ftp  
site. 
Transmissions of electronic data from external data providers  and of ePRO  data (including 
eDiary data in the below illustration) to the clinical data base is illustrated in Figure 5. 
TMF-[ADDRESS_136350] ’s medical record or oth er 
defined document normally used at the trial site. Source data not normally collected as a 
routine part of the clinical practice at the site may be entered on a worksheet.  Clinical 
assessments/safety evaluations must be signed by [CONTACT_121625] y qualified (sub )investigators.  
If the  worksheet does not become part of the subject ’s medical record, the following  should as 
a minimum be added to the subject ’s medical record : 
Date(s) of conducting the informed consent process  (date of enrolment)  including
date of provisi on of subject information
Subject ID
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 113 of 176 
Randomisation code number (if applicable)
The fact that the subject is participating in a clinical trial in  psoriasis  vulgaris
including treatment arms of  LEO [ZIP_CODE]  or vehicle for up to 56 weeks
Other relevant medical information
Allocated treatment once the randomisation code has been broken (if applicable)
13.[ADDRESS_136351] been recorded  to perform source data verification  
and to monitor drug accountability . 
The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the trial site ’s recruitment rate, the compliance 
of the trial site with the protocol and GCP.  
In order to perform their role effectively, monitors and persons involved in quality assuran ce 
and inspections will need direct access  to source  data, e.g. medical records, laboratory reports, 
appointment books, etc.  If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the 
investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition, relevant  
site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring 
visits (e.g. by [CONTACT_756]) .  
14 Handling of an Urgent Safety Measure 
An Urgent Safety Measure is a measure taken to implement an action/protocol deviation 
under an emergency. This is defined within the EU Directive as “…the occurrence of any new 
event relating to the conduct of the trial  or the development of the investigational medicinal 
product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the 
investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any 
immediate h azard. ” (Article 10(b) of Directive 2001/20/EC).  
If the investigator becomes aware of information that necessitates an immediate change in th e 
clinical trial procedure or a temporary halt to the clinical trial in order to protect clinical trial 
subjects fr om any immediate hazard to their health and safety, the investigator can do so 
without  prior approval from LEO , regulatory authority(ies) or IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
The investigator mus t immediately inform LEO  - by [CONTACT_121626] - 
of this ch ange in the clinical trial procedure or of the temporary halt providing full details of 
TMF-[ADDRESS_136352] immediately upon receipt of the urgent safety measure notification in 
accordance with the internal procedures.  
15 Quality Assurance/Audit  
The clinical trial will  be subject to au dits conducted by [CONTACT_121627]/IECs . Audits and inspections may take place 
during or after the trial. The investigator and the site staff as well as LEO staff have an 
obligation to cooperate and assist in audits and inspections. This includes giving auditors and 
inspectors  direct access to all source documents and other documents at the trial site relevant 
to the clinical trial. This includes permission to examine , verify and reproduce any records 
and reports that are important to the evaluation of the trial.  
If the trial site is contact[CONTACT_121628], LEO  must  be notified 
immediately . 
[ADDRESS_136353] ’s last visit.  
Investigators will be informed when subject recruitment is  to cease.  This will also include 
information on when the threshold of 20% of subjects with a ‘mild’ PGA is reached, and 
when a sufficient number of subjects ( approximately 25 subjects with 52 weeks of exposure ) 
have been included in the HPA axis part of t he trial.  
Trial  enrolment will be stopped at a trial site when the total requested number of subjects 
randomised for the clinical trial has been obtained, irrespective of the specific site ’s planned 
inclusion number.  
Upon completion of th e clinical trial, LEO  must  undertake arrangements for the collection 
and disposal of any unused trial material that the investigator is not required to keep in his/her 
files.  
When the randomisation code has been broken, the investigators will receive information 
about the t reatment allocation for the subjects randomised at their respective sites  and will be 
asked to record this in the subject ’s medical record .

16.1.1  Criteria for Premature Termination of  the Trial and/or Trial Site 
LEO , the investigator, the IRB/IECs or competent authorities may decide to stop the trial , part 
of the tr ial or a trial site at any time , but agreement on procedures to be followed must be 
obtained.  
If a trial is suspended or prematurely terminated, the investigator must inform the subjects  
promptly and ensure appropriate therapy and follow -up. As specified by [CONTACT_82089], t he investiga tor or LEO  must promptly inform IRB/IECs and provide a  detailed 
written explanation. Relevant  competent authorities must be informed.  
The trial  must  be terminated  if the perception of the benefit/risk ratio (judged from clinical 
signs and symptoms, (S)AEs and/or remarkable safety laboratory changes) becomes 
unfavourable for  the continuation of the trial . 
Due to the design of this trial, there are no statistical criteria for trial termination.  
16.[ADDRESS_136354] Care Following Trial Completion  
After the completion of the trial, the subjects will be treated at the investigator ’s discre tion o r 
referred to other physician(s) according to  standard practice  (subjects should not be treated 
with Enstilar® until after the final follow -up visit (FU3) ). 
16.[ADDRESS_136355] make arrangements to store the essential trial docu -
ments includ ing the In vestigator Trial File  (ICH E6, Guide line for Good Clinical Practice ) 
until LEO informs the investigator that the documents are no longer to be retained  or longer if 
required by [CONTACT_427] . 
In addition, the investigator is responsible for the archivi ng of all relevant source documents 
so that the trial data can be compared against source data after the completion of the trial (e.g. 
in case of an inspection from regulatory authorities).  
The investigator is required to ensure the continued storage of th e documents even i f the 
investigator  leaves the clinic/practice or retires before the end of the required storage period.  
The destruction process must ensure confidentiality of data and must be done in accordance 
with local regulatory requirements.

Number of relapses during the maintenance phase
TMF-[ADDRESS_136378] ‘mild’. This will be calculated as the number of days from 
randomisation to the day where the subject has the first relapse 
confirmed. For subjects who either do not encounter a relapse or are 
withdrawn from the trial , the number of days will be treated as a 
censored observation a t the day of end of trial visit.  
The number of censored and uncensored observations, i.e. number of 
subjects without relapse and number of subjects with relapse, will be 
summarised by [CONTACT_1570]. The time to first relapse will be 
summarised by [CONTACT_121632], i.e. 
subjects with relapse.  
The primary endpoint will be compared between treatments with the null 
hypothesis that they are equal against the alternative that they are 
different. The analysis will be performed both for the full analysis set 
(primary) and for the per protocol analysis set (supportive). The 
comparison will be done using a proportional hazards model with 
treatment group, trial site, HPA axis testing, and severity at baseline (as 
determined by [CONTACT_121602]) as factors. The estimate of the hazar d ratio of 
active treatment group relative to vehicle group together with the 95% 
confidence interval and p -value will be presented.  
The estimated survival curves with confidence intervals will be 
presented graphically for each of the treatment groups.  Moreover the 
percentiles of the survivial distribution will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6490]. The proportion of subjects who are still at risk for a first relapse 
will be compared between the two treatment groups 24 and 52 weeks 
after randomisation .   
Secondary endpoint s 
The secondary endpoints will be analysed for the full analysis set, with 
the analysis for the per protocol analysis set being supportive. 
Adjustment for multiplicity will be done using the Holm -Bonferroni 
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0

method.  
Number of days in remis sion
The number of days in remission will be calculated for each subject as 
the total number of days in trial during the maintenance period minus the 
number of days in treatment of relapses, if any. If a subject is withdrawn 
from the trial for any reason, then the subject is considered not to be in 
remission from when the subject leaves the trial.  
The number of days in remission will be summarised by [CONTACT_6490].  
The number of days in remission will be analysed by [CONTACT_121633] (ANO V A) model with treatment group, trial site, 
HPA axis testing,  and severity at baseline as factors. Estimated difference 
between active treatment group and vehicle group, 95% confidence 
interval, and p -value will be presented.  
Number of relapses during main tenance phase
The number of relapses will be calculated as the sum of confirmed 
relapses for each subject. Subjects contribute with observed time only. 
The rate of relapses during the maintenance phase is assumed to be 
constant over time.  
The number of relapses will be analysed in a Poisson regression model 
with treatment group, trial site, HPA axis testing, and severity at baseline 
as factors, subject as a random effect,  and risk time as an offset. The r isk 
time is the observed time at ri sk for each subject, i.e. the total time in 
trial during the maintenance period time minus the periods of treatment 
of relapses, if any. The estimated incidence rate ratio for active treatme nt 
group relative to vehicle group with 95% confidence interval an d p-value 
will be presented.

Appendix 2: U.S. Prescribing information for CORTROSYN ® 
(cosyntronin) for injection  
CORTROSYN®™  
FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY  
(cosyntropin) for Injection  
DESCRIPTION  
CORTROSYN ™ (cosyntropin) for Injection is a sterile lyophilized powder in vials containing  
0.25 mg of CORTROSYN ™ and 10 mg of mannitol to be reconstituted with 1 mL of 0.9%  
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Administration is by [CONTACT_121634].  
Cosyntropin is α [ADDRESS_136379] 24 of the 39 amino acids of natural  
ACTH. The sequence of amino acids in the 1 - 24 compound is as follows:  
Ser - Tyr - Ser - Met - Glu - His - Phe - Arg - Trp - Gly - Lys - Pro - Val - Gly - Lys - Lys - Arg - Arg - Pro - Val - Lys - Val - Tyr - Pro 
1   2    3    4    5   6    7    8    9   10    11   12    13   14    15   16    17   18    19    20    21    22   23   24 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
CORTROSYN ™ (cosyntropin) for Injection exhibits the full cortico -steroidogenic activity of  
natural ACTH. Various studies have shown that the biologic activity of ACTH resides in the  
N-terminal  portion of the molecule and that the 1 - 20 amino acid residue is the minimal
sequence retaining full activity. Partial or complete loss of activity is noted with progres sive
shortening of the chain beyond 20 amino acid residues. For example, the decremen t from 20
to 19 results in a 70% loss of potency.  
The pharmacologic profile of CORTROSYN ™ is similar to that of purified natural ACTH. It  
has been established that 0.25 mg of CORTROSYN ™ will stimulate the adrenal cortex  
maximally and to the same extent as  25 units of natural ACTH. This dose of CORTROSYN ™ 
will produce maximal secretion of 17 -OH corticosteroids, 17 - ketosteroids and / or 17 - 
ketogenic steroids.  
The extra -adrenal effects which natural ACTH and CORTROSYN ™ have in common include  
increased mel anotropic activity, increased growth hormone secretion and an adipokinetic  
TMF-[ADDRESS_136380]. These are considered to be without physiological or clinical significance.  
Animal, human and synthetic ACTH (1 -39) which all contain [ADDRESS_136381] very little immunologic although full
biologic activity. This property of CORTROSYN ™ assumes added importance in view of the
known antigenicity of natural ACTH.
INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE  
CORTROSYN ™ (cosyntropin) for Injection is intended for use as a diagnostic agent in the  
screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency. Because of its rapid  
effect on the adrenal cortex it may be utilized to perform a [ADDRESS_136382] of  adrenal function  
(plasma cortisol response) as an office or outpatient procedure, using only 2 venipunctures  
(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section).  
Severe hypofunction of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] - adrenal axis is usually associated with subnormal  
plasma cortisol  values but a low basal level is not per se evidence of adrenal insufficiency and  
does not suffice to make the diagnosis. Many patients with proven insufficiency will have  
normal basal levels and will develop signs of insufficiency only when stressed. For this reason  
a criterion which should be used in establishing the diagnosis is the failure to respond to  
adequate corticotropin stimulation. When presumptive adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed by a  
subnormal CORTROSYN ™ test, further studies are indicated to  determine if it is primary or  
secondary.  
Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison ’s disease) is the result of an intrinsic disease proc ess, 
such as tuberculosis within the gland. The production of adrenocortical hormones is deficien t 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_121524] (feedback mechanism). Secondary or relative insufficiency arises  
as the result of defective production of ACTH leading in turn to disuse atrophy of the adren al 
cortex. It is commonly seen, for example, as result of corticosteroid therapy, Sheehan ’s 
synd rome and pi[INVESTIGATOR_121525].  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 136 of 176 
The differentiation of both types is based on the premise that a primarily defective gland  
cannot be stimulated by [CONTACT_121635] a secondarily defective gland is potentially functional  
and will respond to adequate stimulation with ACTH. Patients selected for further study as the  
result of a subnormal CORTROSYN ™ test should be given a 3 or 4 day course of treatment  
with Repository Corticotropin Injection USP and then retested. Suggested doses are 40 USP  
units twice d aily for 4 days or 60 USP units twice daily for 3 days. Under these conditions  
little or no increase in plasma cortisol levels will be seen in Addison ’s disease whereas hi gher 
or even normal levels will be seen in cases with secondary adrenal insufficiency . 
CONTRAINDICATION  
The only contraindication to CORTROSYN ™ (cosyntropin) for Injec -tion is a history of a  
previous adverse reaction to it.  
PRECAUTIONS  
General  
CORTROSYN ™ (cosyntropin) for Injection exhibits slight immunologic activity, does not  
contain animal protein and is therefore less risky to use than natural ACTH. Patients known to  
be sensitized to natural ACTH with markedly positive skin tests will, with few exceptions, 
react  negatively when tested intradermally with CORTROSYN ™. Most patients with  a 
history  of a previous hypersensitivity reaction to natural ACTH or a pre -existing allergic 
disease will  tolerate CORTROSYN ™. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_121526], CORTROSYN ™ is not 
completely devoid  of immunologic activity and hypersensitivity reactions including rare 
anaphylaxis are  possible. Therefore, the physician should be pre -pared, prior to injection, to 
treat any possible  acute hypersensitivity reaction.  
Drug Interactions  
Corticotropin may accentuate the electrolyte loss associated with diuretic therapy.

Long term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic  
potential or impairment of fertility. A study in rats noted inhibition of reproductive function  
like natural ACTH.  
TMF-[ADDRESS_136383] not been conducted with  
CORTROSYN ™ (cosyntropin) for Injection. It is also not known whether CORTROSYN ™ 
can cause fetal harm when ad -ministered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction  
capacity. CORTROSYN ™ should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.  
Nursing Mothers  
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are  
excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when CORTROSYN ™ (cosyn tropin) for  
Injection is administered to a nursing woman.  
Pediatric Use  
(See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.)  
ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Since CORTROSYN® ™ (cosyntropin) for Injection is intended for diagnostic and not  
therapeutic use, adverse reactions other t han a rare hypersensitivity reaction are not  
anticipated. A rare hypersensitivity reaction usually associated with a pre -existing allergic  
disease and/or a previous reaction to natural ACTH is possible. Symptoms may include slight  
whealing with splotchy er ythema at the injection site. There have been rare reports of  
anaphylactic reaction. The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients after the  
administration of CORTROSYN® ™ and the association has been neither confirmed nor  
refuted:  
obradycardia
o tachycardia
o hypertension
o peripheral edema
o rash
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
CORTROSYN ™ (cosyntropin) for Injection may be administered intramuscularly or as a  
direct intravenous injection when used as a rapid screening test of adrenal function. It may  
also be given as an intravenous infusion over a 4 to 8 hour period to provide a greater  
stimulus to the adrenal glands. Doses of CORTROSYN ™ 0.[ADDRESS_136384] of adrenal function has been described by [CONTACT_121636] (1). A control blood sample of 6 to 7 ml is collected in a heparinized tube.  
Reconstitute 0.25 mg of CORTROSYN ™ with 1mL of 0.9% Sodium Chlori de Injection, USP  
and inject intramuscularly. The reconstituted drug product should be inspected visually for  
particulate matter and discoloration prior to injection. Reconstituted CORTROSYN ™ should  
not be retained. In the pediatric population, aged 2 year s or less, a dose of 0.125 mg will often  
suffice. A second blood sample is collected exactly 30 minutes later. Both blood samples  
should be refrigerated until sent to the laboratory for determination of the plasma cortisol  
response by [CONTACT_121637]. If it is not possible to send them to the laboratory or  
perform the fluorimetric procedure within 12 hours, then the plasma should be separated and  
refrigerated or frozen according to need.  
Two alternative methods of administration are intravenous inje ction and infusion.  
CORTROSYN ™ can be injected intravenously in 2 to 5 mL of saline over a 2 -minute period.  
When given as an intravenous infusion: CORTROSYN ™, 0.[ADDRESS_136385] day and

TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 139 of 176 
A paradoxical response may be noted in the cortis one or hydrocortisone group as seen in a  
decrease in plasma cortisol values following a stimulating dose of CORTROSYN ™. 
In the spi[INVESTIGATOR_121528] a normal incremental response is to be expected . 
Many patients with normal adrenal function , however, do not respond to the expected degree  
so that the following criteria have been established to denote a normal response:  
1. The control plasma cortisol level should exceed 5 micrograms/[ADDRESS_136386] 7 micrograms/100 ml above the
basal level.
3. The 30 -minute level should exceed 18 micrograms/[ADDRESS_136387]
been reported by [CONTACT_121638] -workers
Plasma cortisol levels usually peak about 45 to 60 minutes after an injection of  
CORTROSYN ™ and some prefer the [ADDRESS_136388] CORTROSYN ™ increment exhibit diurnal changes. However, the 30 -minute  
plasma cortisol level remains unchanged throughout the day so that only this single criterio n 
should be used (3).  
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration  
whenever solution and container permit. Reconstituted CORTROSYN ™ should not be  
retained.

Appendix 3: Summary of Product Characteristics for Synacthen® 
(Tetracosactide) Ampoules 250mcg    
[ADDRESS_136389] for the investigation of adrenocortical insufficiency.  
4.2 Posolog y and method of administration  
Adults : This preparation of Synacthen is intended for administration for  
diagnostic purposes only as a single intramuscular or intravenous dose; it is  
not to be used for repeated therapeutic administration.  
The [ADDRESS_136390]: This test is based on measurement  
of the plasma cortisol concentration immediately before and exactly 30  
minutes after an intramuscular or intravenous injection of 250micrograms  
(1ml) Synacthen. Adrenocortical function can be regard ed as normal if the  
post-injection rise in plasma cortisol concentration increases by 200 nmol/litre  
(70 micrograms/litre), i.e. if the value 30 minutes after injection is >500  
nmol/litre (180 micrograms/litre), adrenocortical function is regarded as  
normal. All the plasma samples should be stored in a refrigerator until plasma  
cortisol level estimation.  
Where the [ADDRESS_136391] 
can be performed with Synacthen Depot (see separate Summary of Product  
Characteristics). Furthermore, a [ADDRESS_136392] with Synacthen Depot may be used  
to differentiate between primary and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.  
Children : An intravenous  dose of 250micrograms/1.73m² body surface area  
has been suggested. Thus for children aged [ADDRESS_136393] body surface area tables should be consulted.  
Elderly: There is no evidence to suggest that dosage should be different in the  
elderly.  
4.3 Contraindications  
Known hypersensitivity to tetracosactide and/or ACTH or to any of the  
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_121529] 6.[ADDRESS_136394] of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Synacthen is contra -indicated in patients with allergic disorders (e.g. asthma)  
(see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use), acute psychosis,  
infectious diseases, peptic ulcer, refractory heart failure, Cushing’s syndrome,  
treatment of primary adrenocortical insuf ficiency and adrenocongenital  
syndrome.  
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  
Before using Synacthen, the doctor should make every effort to find out  
whether the patient is suffering from, or has a history of, allergic disorders (see  
Section 4.3 “Contra -indications”). In particular, he should enquire whether the  
patient has previously experienced adverse reactions to ACTH, Synacthen or  
other drugs.  
Synacthen should only be administered under the supervision of appropriate  
senior hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121530] (e.g. consultants).  
If local or systemic hypersensitivity reactions occur after the injection (for  
example, marked redness and pain at the injection site, urticaria, pruritus,  
flushing, faintness, severe malaise or dyspnoea), Synacthen or other ACTH  
preparations must be discontinued and should be avoided in the future.  
Hypersensitivity reactions tend to occur within 30 minutes of an injection.  
The patient should therefore be kept under observation during this time.  
Preparation should be made in adva nce to combat any anaphylactic reaction  
that may occur after an injection of Synacthen. In the event of a serious  
anaphylactic reaction, the patient should be treated appropriately with  
adrenaline and steroids.  
Synacthen Ampoules should not be used in the  presence of active infectious or  
systemic diseases, when the use of live vaccine is contemplated or in the  
presence of a reduced immune response, unless adequate disease specific  
therapy is being given.  
Use with care in patients with hypertension and thr omboembolic tendencies.  
Use cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex owing to possible  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0

corneal perforation.  
The increased production of adrenal steroids may result in corticosteroid type  
effects:  
Psychological disturbances may be triggered (e.g.  euphoria, insomnia, mood  swings,
personality changes and severe depression, or even frank psychotic  manifestations).
Existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be  aggravated
Latent infections (e.g. amoebiasis, tuberculosis) may become activated
Ocular effects may be produced (e.g. glaucoma, cataracts)
Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients being treated for diabetes or
hypertension
If Synacthen is used in any of the following conditions, the risks of treatment  should
be weighed  against the possible benefits: ulcerative colitis,  diverticulitis, recent
intestinal anastomosis, kidney failure, hypertension,  predisposition to
thromboembolism, osteoporosis, myasthenia gravis.
The solution for injection contains less than 1 mmol sodiu m (23 mg) per  
ampoule, i.e. essentially ‘sodium - free’.  
Lack of diagnostic accuracy  
Post administration total plasma cortisol levels during Synacthen test might be  
misleading in some special clinical situations due to altered cortisol binding  
globulin lev els. These situations include patients on oral contraceptives, post  
operative patients, critical illness, severe liver disease, nephrotic syndrome.  
Hence in these circumstances, alternative parameters (e.g., salivary cortisol,  
free cortisol index, plasma f ree cortisol) can be used to assess the integrity of  
HPA axis.  
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Severe jaundice has been observed for concurrent use of Synacthen and  
valproate in paediatric population. Their con current use should be avoided.  
Concurrent use of Synacthen and other anticonvulsants (e.g. phenytoin,  
clonazepam, nitrazepam, phenobarbital, primidone) may increase the risk of  
liver damage thus, Synacthen should be used with caution at minimum  
possible doses and for minimum duration for concurrent treatment.  
Endogenous and synthetic oestrogens can cause an increase in total cortisol  
levels and therefore, it is considered appropriate to use alternative methods  
(e.g., salivary cortisol, free cortisol inde x, plasma free cortisol) for  
interpretation of the results of the HPA axis examination (see Section 4.4  
Special warnings and precaution for use).  
Since Synacthen increases the adrenocortical production of glucocorticoids  
and mineralocorticoids, drug inter actions of the type seen with these  
corticosteroids may occur (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions  
TMF-000031210 - Version 2. 0
LP0053 -1004  12-Apr-2018 Page 144 of 176 
for use). Patients already receiving medication for diabetes mellitus or for  
moderate to severe hypertension must have their dosage adjusted if treatment  
with Synacthen is started.  
4.[ADDRESS_136395] to reproductive toxicity (see Section 5.3  
Preclinical safety data). Synacthen should be used during pregnancy only if the  
expected benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.  
Breast -feeding  
It is not known whether tetracosactide enters breast milk or not. Because many drugs  
are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Synacthen is  
administered to a breastfeeding woman.  
Fertility  
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see Section 5.3  
Preclinical safety data).  
4.[ADDRESS_136396] -marketing experience  
via spontaneous cases reports and literature cases. Because these reactions are  
reported volunt arily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably  
estimate their frequency which is therefore categorised as not known. Undesirable  
effects are listed according to system organ classes in MedDRA. Within each system  
organ class, unde sirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The undesirable effects related to glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects are  
unlikely to be observed with short -term use of Synacthen as a diagnostic tool,  but may  
be reported when Synacthen is used in therapeutic indications. Should information be  
required on the side effects reported with therapeutic use of tetracosactide acetate, see

5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anterior pi[INVESTIGATOR_121533] – 
ACTH.  
ATC code: H01AA02.  
Tetracosactide acetate consists of the first [ADDRESS_136399] minimal suppression of hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_121534] -term corticosteroids.  
The site of action of ACTH is the plasma membrane of the adrenocortical  
cells, where it binds to a specific receptor. The hormone -receptor complex  
activates adenylate cyclase, stimulating the production of cyclic AMP  
(adenosine monophosphate) and so promoting the synthesis of pregnenolone  
from cholesterol. F rom pregnenolone the various corticosteroids are produced  
via different enzymatic pathways.  
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  
Distribution  
Tetracosactide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_121535],  
which lead to rapid decrease in its plasma levels.  
There is no evidence of binding of ACTH to any particular plasma protein, though  
some non -specific interaction with albumin has been reported. Tetracosactide acetate  
has an apparent volume of distribution of approximately 0.4L/kg.  
Biotransformation  
In the serum, tetracosactide acetate is broken down by [CONTACT_121640]. The rapid  
elimination from plasma is probably not attributable to this relatively slow cleavage  
process, but rather to the rapid concentration of the active substance in the adrenal  
glands and kidneys.  
Elimination  
Following an intravenous injection, elimination of tetracosactide acetate from the  
plasma consists of 3 phases. The half -lives o f these phases are approximately 7  
minutes (0 to 1 hour), 37 minutes (1 to 2 hours) and 3 hours thereafter.  
Following an iv dose of 131I-labelled tetracosactide acetate, 95 to 100% of the  
radioactivity is excreted in the urine within [ADDRESS_136400]  of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_121536],

Appendix 4: Definitions of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (incl uding an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether 
or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  (ICH Harmonized Tripartite 
Guideline for Good Clinica l Practice, E6 (R1)).  
This definition includes : 
accidental injuries, events related to trial procedures, reasons for any unfavourab le
and unplanned change in medication (drug and/or dose), clinically significant
worsening of pre -existing conditions, or r easons for admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121537] . It also includes
AEs commonly observed and AEs anticipated based on the pharmacological effect
of the investigational product. In addition, any laboratory a bnormality assessed as
clinically significant by [CONTACT_941] (sub)investigator must be recorded as an AE.
Serious Adverse Event Definition  
A serious adverse e vent (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that  
results in death
is life -threatening
requires inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121538].
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121539] ’s medical

is a medically important condition. Events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121540]. Examples are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at
home for allergic broncospasm , blood dyscrasias and convulsions that do no t result
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , development of  drug dep endency or drug abuse.

Appendix 5: Classification of Adverse Events  
Severity  
The severity  of the AE should  be described in terms of mild, moderate or severe according to 
the (sub)investigator ’s clinical  judgement . 
Mild  An adverse event that is usually tr ansient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere 
with usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate  An a dverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily 
living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm 
to the subject.  
Severe  An a dverse event that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or 
significantly affe cts clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic 
intervention.  
If the severity of an AE worsens, a new AE should be recorded.  
Causality  
The causal relation  of the AE to the use of the investigational product should  be described in 
terms of probable, possible  or not related according to the following:  
Probably 
related  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
investigational product . 
Could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinica l state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455] . 
Follows a known pattern of response to the investigational product . 
Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the 
investigational product . 
Reappears or worsens upon re -challenge . 
TMF-[ADDRESS_136403] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or  other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455] . 
Follows a known pattern of response to the investigational product . 
Not related  Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
investigational product . 
Is better explained by [CONTACT_121641] r factors like the subject ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455] . 
Does not reappear or worsen upon re -challenge . 
Does not follow a known pattern of response to the investigational product . 
Outcome  
The outcome  of the ev ent should  be classified and handled as follows:  
Recovered/  
resolved  The event has stopped. The stop date of the event must be recorded.  
Recovering/  
resolving  The subject is clearly recovering from an event. The event is not y et 
completely resolved.  
Not 
recovered/  
not resolved  Event is still ongoing. 
Recovered 
with 
sequelae  The event has reached a state where no further changes are expected and the 
residual symptoms are assumed to persist. An example is hemiparesis after 
stroke.  
The stop date of the event must be recorded. In case of a SAE, the sequelae 
should be specified.  
Fatal  The subject has died as a consequence of the event. Date of death is recorded 
as stop date for the AE.  
Unknown  Unknown to (sub)investigator, e.g. subject lost to follow -up.

Table 3  In the previous version of the protocol it 
was specified that during relapse 
treatment, all psoriasis areas were to be 
treated with rescue medication (active 
LEO [ZIP_CODE]) once daily for up to 
4 weeks. This amendment introduces  a 
new treatment principle so that only 
active areas will be treated with  rescue 
medication for 4 weeks ( regardless of 
whether the pso riasis clears  before 
4 weeks ) while non -active psoriasis areas 
will continue  twice weekly maintenance 
treatment.  To change the way psoriasis 
relapses are treated in  order 
to better reflect how 
LEO  [ZIP_CODE] will be used in 
real life . 
Sections 3.3.3 and 10.2  Use of trial medication is now 
disallowed on the scalp during 
once -daily treatment periods (initial 
open -label  treatment period and relapse 
treatment periods).  On request from t he French 
regulatory authority

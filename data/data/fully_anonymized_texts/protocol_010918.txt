1.1 The public health burden of cardiovascular disease  
 
Heart disease represents a significant public health burden around the globe and remains the leading cause of death for both men and women in the [LOCATION_002]. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), the most common form of heart disease, kills nearly 400,[ADDRESS_1019897] productivity, CHD alone costs the U.S. nearly $[ADDRESS_1019898] been well established. Effective management of these risk factors remains a key strategy in both the primary and secondary prevention of CHD.

1.3  The challenge of primary prevention in low SES populations  
 
Individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES) experience a disproportionately high risk 
of cardiovascular disease and cancer.         
 Pharmacologic  measures are frequently needed, but there is no consensus on how to 
optimally implement such measures.  Two competing approaches have been advocated 
for cardiovascular risk reduction: the “high- risk strategy” and the “population- based  
strategy.”
6,7 In the  high-risk strategy , preventive measures are targeted specifically at 
high-risk individuals, with medication therapy tailored to each patient’s risk factor profile 
(i.e. a personalized approach).  The identification of high- risk patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_745602] -based prediction algorithms, such as the Framingham Risk Score.  
This has been the traditional approach endorsed in major guidelines, such as JNC [ADDRESS_1019899] likely to develop a cardiovascular event.  

Protocol Version # 7 5 PI: [CONTACT_107748], Thomas  
Protocol Date: 12/28/2016  Center Director: Harrison, David  On the other hand, it is estimated that two- thirds or more of cardiovascular events occur 
in individuals who are at low or intermediate risk by [CONTACT_745643].  
Further more , the cost/benefit equation may differ in low SES populations.    
 
   
 
 The m
ost recent cholesterol guidelines from the ACC/AHA (an update to ATP 3) endorse 
a hybrid of the high- risk and population- based approaches.  The guidelines recommend 
statin pharmacotherapy for individuals with a predicted 10- year cardiovascular risk of 
7.5% or higher.9  Targeting individuals based on individual risk estimates embodies a 
high-risk approach.  On the other hand, by [CONTACT_745644] 20% over 10 
years (in ATP 3) to 7.5% over [ADDRESS_1019900] a less 
personaliz ed strategy.  
 
    
      
 
 
1.4  The “polypi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]” approach and underserved populations  
 A relatively recent iteration of the population strategy is the “polypi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]” concept.  The polypi[INVESTIGATOR_745603] a fixed dose combination of medications with proven benefits for cardiovascular prevention,

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
3.1 Overview  and study hypothesis  
 
The proposed study is a two- group, randomized, open- label comparison of polypi[INVESTIGATOR_745609] 300 individuals (150 per arm) without prior cardiovascular disease.  The duration of treatment is 1 year, and outcomes will include medication adherence, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol.  We hypothesize that use of a polypi[INVESTIGATOR_745610] a low SES, primary prevention setting, and will be associated with better cardiovascular risk factor control compared with usual care.

3.2 Study  sample 
 
 We will leverage an existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_745611], the NCI -funded Southern 
Community Cohort Study (SCCS).   
   
      
 
 
  
  
       
 
 
      
 
 
 
 
 
3.3 Study  medication (polypi[INVESTIGATOR_4382])  
 
The study medication will be a fixed- dose combination pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (polypi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) containing: 
atorvastatin 10 mg, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 2.5 mg, losartan 25 mg, and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg.  
As this is an open -label trial, there will be no placebo provided in the “usual care” arm.  
The polypi[INVESTIGATOR_745612], to maximize compliance. The lowest 
standard doses (or half -doses) of the component medications are used to minimize side 
effects that might lead to discontinuation of the entire combination.  Fixed dosing is intended to obviate the need for titration and frequent follow -up visits.  Nonetheless,

than 2 anti -hypertensive medications at baseline will not be included in the trial.  
 
    
 Atorvastatin .  Evidence from 14 primary prevention trials randomizing nearly 50,000 
individuals indicates that statins reduce coronary events by [CONTACT_3450] 25%, and all -

abnormalities may occur, they are often dose- dependent  (i.e. m ore common at doses 
higher than the dose chosen for the polypi[INVESTIGATOR_4382])  and cease with drug discontinuation.  In fact, 
rates of myalgia and liver function test abnormalities do not differ between statin and placebo groups enrolled in randomized trials.  The same is true for rates of adverse events 
or drug discontinuation.  Clinically overt liver failure and rhabdoymyolysis with statins are exceedingly rare, particularly in the absence of interacting drugs, which will be excluded by [CONTACT_990].

provide any additional  information, no further study visits or study -related telephone 
contacts can be conducted.  
 
4.5 Preliminary  eligibility data from Franklin SCCS participants    
 We applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to the Franklin SCCS sample based on data collected at entry and during routine follow up of the cohort.  Even restricting the 
Franklin population to SCCS participants who participated in the routine follow -up 
contacts (and thus have demonstrated recent continuing active interest in participating in 
SCCS follow up activities), we estimate that nearly 1,000 individuals would be eligible for entry into the trial, with greater numbers available should participants who did not complete a follow -up survey be considered.  One of the study’s aims will be to estimate  
and measure recruitment rates,

  Participants will be instructed to 
take one pi[INVESTIGATOR_745618].  
 All polypi[INVESTIGATOR_745619], including unopened or partially -used containers, must be 
maintained at the study site for eventual return to the Vanderbilt IDS . 
 
5.2 Treatment  assignment  
 Participants who meet eligibility criteria after the initial Franklin visit will be invited to participate in the study, and randomized to polypi[INVESTIGATOR_745620].  Block randomization will be performed according to baseline hypertension status.  The randomization key will be maintained at the International Epi[INVESTIGATOR_745621] (IEI).  Physicians at the Franklin Primary site will prescribe the polypi[INVESTIGATOR_745622].

7.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis  
 
7.1 Primary and secondary outcome measures  
 Primary outcomes  
The co -primary outcomes will be medication adherence (based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_526602] -
report), systolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol, at 12 months.  
 Secondary outcomes  
Medication adherence, systolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol at 2 months.  The 
primary endpoint variables will also be measured at the interim, 2- month visit.  
 Drug metabolite profile.   Medication adherence will be further assessed using a novel 
drug screening panel  
        
 Insul
in resistance.  At baseline and 12 months, we will measure HOMA -IR using fasting 
glucose and insulin as previously described.34 
 Inflammatory profile.  The measures of inflammation will include plasma levels of IL- 17, 
IFN-g, IL-6, IL-10 and high -sensitivity C- reactive protein.        
   
 Recruitment response rates . Recruitment response rates will be tracked  
 
 
 7.2 Statistical  analyses and power  
 
 In our primary analyses, we will evaluate systolic blood pressure (SBP) and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) using multivariable regression models with treatment group 
as the primary covariate, and age, gender, racial/ethnic group as additional covariates.  

Protocol Version # 7 17 PI: [CONTACT_107748], Thomas  
Protocol Date: 12/28/2016  Center Director: Harrison, David  The baseline measurement of each outcome will be included in the respective model.  
Note  that even though systolic blood pressure is used in stratified randomization, we will 
include it in the SBP model following the recommendations by [CONTACT_745648].35,[ADDRESS_1019913] estimates to differ between subgroups, in exploratory additional analyses interaction terms will be considered between treatment and each of age, gender, and racial/ethnic group.  Secondary outcomes will be analyzed in the same fashion.  A two -sided p -value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant .  Because 
this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will not divide the p- value for these 2 co- primary outcomes.  
 
 
Detectable treatment effects for SBP and LDL depend on the true correlation between the baseline and 12 month data.  The Table  above summarizes the detectable difference 
with sample size of 150 in each group at 80% power for plausible correlations between two time points.  We expect a high correlation between the time points, suggesting that 
the scenarios shown for r=0.7 or r=0.[ADDRESS_1019914] likely.  Estimates of baseline variability (SD) are based on existing SCCS data, and closely approximate those obtained in other cohorts with large minority representation, such as the Jackson Heart Study.
16,17 
 We also incorporated the possibility of 10% and 20% dropout (n=135 and n=120 in each arm, respectively).  Type I error rate was controlled at 5%.  As shown, we have excellent 
power to detect clinically meaningful differences.  Indeed, the detectable differences for SBP and LDL are far lower than those found using a similar polypi[INVESTIGATOR_745628], though that study used a placebo comparison rather than usual care,  which likely 
overestimates the differences.
22 Further , these power analyses are based on simple 
univariate tests; our proposed multivariable regression models should be more powerful because they take into account covariates.  
 For recruitment, with 1,050 contacts to potential enrollees, we can estimate recruitment response rates to within ±3%.  For adherence, our sample size is large enough to estimate a simplified adherence measure (Yes/No) with a precision of ±8%.  In additional regression models, pi[INVESTIGATOR_745629]- root transformed if necessary to satisfy the 
regression assumption (normality of the residuals).

fasting include hypovolemia. Study participants will be instructed to drink plenty of fluids on the day prior to their visit.  
 
8.2 Phlebotomy  
Risks related to phlebotomy are rare and include syncope, hematoma formation, and phlebitis. A total of  approximately  45 mL (equivalent to a few tablespoons) will be drawn 
from study participants, with no more than [ADDRESS_1019916] been extensively evaluated individually and in combination.

 Patients in the usual care arm will be informed of the risks of the medications they are 
prescribed. The risks associated with each drug contained in the polypi[INVESTIGATOR_745633].  
 The first study visit on medication will take place at 2 months, with additional visits at the discretion of the participants’ physicians.  During the trial, all adverse events will be reported to the study IRB in a timeframe consistent with IRB policies.  The trial will also be monitored by [CONTACT_745649] (#124626) . 
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1019917] serious side effects of atorvastatin are liver failure and myositis, which 
occur, if at all, in less than 1% of patients receiving a statin.  
 
8.3.2 Amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_745634], rapid heart rate, dizziness, fatigue, and flushing. These side effects are rare (likely to be less than 5%) and are likely to cease as soon as the medication is discontinued.  
 
8.3.3 Losartan  risks 
Protocol Version # 7 19 PI: [CONTACT_107748], Thomas  
Protocol Date: 12/28/2016  Center Director: Harrison, David  Potenti al side effects of losartan are dizziness, cough, diarrhea, weakness/fatigue, 
hypoglycemia, anemia, and hyperkalemia. These side effects are rare (likely to be less 
than 5%) and are likely to cease as soon as the medication is discontinued. Furthermore, the theoretical risk of hyperkalemia is offset by [CONTACT_745650].  
 
8.3.4 Hydrochlorothiazide  risks 
Uncommon side effects of hydrochlorothiazide are weakness, jaundice, diarrhea, vomiting, imbalances and abnormalities i n blood electrolyte levels (e.g., hypokalemia), 
rash, photophobia, and impotence. Serious side effects of hydrochlorothiazide include kidney disease or kidney failure. However, these serious side effects generally occur at high medication doses ( ≥25mg ). Fo r the 12.5 mg dose contained in the polypi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], the 
chance of serious side effects is likely to be less than 1%.  Furthermore, the theoretical risk of hypokalemia is offset by [CONTACT_745651].

 8.4.1 Definition  of an Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant , temporally associated with the use of 
the polypi[INVESTIGATOR_745635].  Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the polypi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] .  
 Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre- existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after medication administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of study 
medication or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE).  
 Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.

Protocol Date: 12/28/2016  Center Director: Harrison, David  • The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms 
of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  
 
8.4.2 Definition  of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, results in:  
a. death  
 b. a life-threatening experience  
NOTE: The term 'life- threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
 c. inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745636]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment  that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or out -patient setting.  Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre- existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.  
 d. persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or  
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
  e. requires, based on reasonable medical judgment, a medical or surgical 
 intervention to prevent an outcome described in list a – d.   
 NOTE: Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
 appropriate in situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
 immediatel y life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745637].  These should 
 also be considered serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant 
 cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
 bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

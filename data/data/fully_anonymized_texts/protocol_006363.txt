tomographic arteriograms  (CTA) can be reduced without degradation of image quality. The hypothesis is 
that there is no difference in image quality using ultra-low dose contrast in CTA exams compared to 
routine dose exams.

volume). By [CONTACT_748666], a smaller overall dose can be 
given while  still obtaining adequate diagnostic imaging. Quantitative measurements of vascular

addition, qualitative  evaluation of these images by [CONTACT_748667]. This data suggests that the same quality of 
images can  be obtained with a lower dose of contrast minimizing the risk of contrast induced 
nephropathy. No  references are available at this time regarding the rate of re-imaging due to non-
interpretable CTA  studies. In correspondence with several CT technologists, they stated that in their 
experience, rarely  does a CTA of the chest or chest, abdomen and pelvis have to be repeated

STUDY00003932

Page 4 of  14 (V.08/18/2015) the risk  of nephropathy. Development of a low dose protocol would potentially decrease the risk of 
contrast induced nephropathy  in this patient population.  
3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion  Criteria
3.1 Inclusion Criteria
1. Any  adult patient scheduled for a computed tomographic arteriogram (CTA) of the chest or CTA of 
the abdomen  or CTA of the chest and abdomen or CTA of the abdomen and pelvis or CTA of the 
chest, abdomen  and pelvis who had undergone a prior CTA of the same region performed with the 
standard contrast  dose (100 mL) at this institution will be included in the study.
2. The  follow-up scan will be routine standard of care, no emergency imaging patient will be 
approached for this research.
3.2 Exclusion  Criteria
1. Patients  with no prior CTA imaging for comparison. 
2. Any  pediatric patient (age <18). 
3. BMI  >[ADDRESS_1023776].
6. GFR  less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 – GFR should be within normal range. This would allow a repeat study if 
needed and not pose an increased risk to renal dysfunction.
7. Cognitively Impaired  Adults
8. non-English speaking  patients
9. Pregnant  Females
10. Endoleak  studies – decreased contrast makes evaluation of an endoleak difficult on delayed imaging.
3.3 Early  Withdrawal of Subjects
3.3.1 Criteria  for removal from study
Patient may  decline or withdraw from participation at any time after the consent is signed.
3.3.2 Follow-up for  withdrawn subjects
The information  required for the study is obtained at the initial time of evaluation. If a person 
declines to participate, no data will be acquired. There is no reason to follow up withdrawn 
subjects.
4.0 Recruitment  Methods
4.1 Identification  of subjects

alteration of authorization
Potential subjects’  history of procedures completed at this institution are kept within medical

disclosures or releases of identifiable information granted under this waiver will be accounted for and 
documented.
7.0 Study  Design and Procedures
7.1 Study  Design
Any adult patient  scheduled for routine CTA meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and providing 
consent will  be included in the study. The patient will be administered a low dose of intravenous 
contrast based  on the study examination as described below. The contrast agent being used is 
Omnipaque. The  scan will be performed under the supervision of the primary investigator or the 
described team members  to make sure that the study is of diagnostic quality.
The following dose  protocols will be followed:
CTA of  the chest: [ADDRESS_1023781] at a rate of 5mL/sec. A region of interest (ROI) to trigger 
the scan will  be placed in the aortic arch. If scan is performed using high pi[INVESTIGATOR_748658], the scan 
delay will be  increased by [ADDRESS_1023782],  abdomen and pelvis: [ADDRESS_1023783] at a rate 5mL/sec. A region of interest 
(ROI) to  trigger the scan will be placed in the aortic arch. If scan is performed using high pi[INVESTIGATOR_748659], the scan  delay will be increased by 2 seconds.
All other  imaging parameters will remain unchanged, given that the subjects enrolled will be clinical 
patients of the  principle investigator.
Following the  examination, the primary investigator (PI) or team members will evaluate the images 
obtained with  low contrast dose and each patient’s prior CTA examination performed with routine 
contrast dose.  This will be done by [CONTACT_748669]. For the quantitative portion, 
the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_748660]. For qualitative measurement, the images will be presented in a 
blind fashion  to two thoracic trained board certified radiologists and a board certified interventional 
radiologist to  determine the quality of the images based on a Likert numerical scale. Qualitative and 
quantitative data for the  images obtained with low contrast dose and those for the prior CTA 
examinations performed  with routine contrast dose will be compared. This data along with details of the 
STUDY00003932
Approval: 11/16/2018
Page 8 of  14 (V.08/18/2015) scan protocol (dose,  dose rate, scanning parameters etc.) and demographic data (such as sex, age and 
BMI at  the time of examination) will be recorded in Redcap. 
7.2 Study  Procedures
7.2.1 Clinic  Visit
The process of  obtaining the CTA images will be unchanged from the patient’s standpoint. One 
difference will be that the examination will be supervised by a team member. The intravenous 
contrast dose administered will be decreased according to the parameters written above.  If the 
study is deemed non-diagnostic at the time of scanning, the study will be repeated. The 
standard of care at this institution in the setting of a non-diagnostic study is to repeat the study 
with a 75mL dose of contrast, for a total of 175mL of contrast. Given that the dose of contrast 
that will be administered for this study (40-50mL) is below the routine amount (100mL). 
Performing a repeat study with 75mL of intravenous contrast will not exceed the contrast dose 
that would have been normally administered.

REVISION HISTORY  
 
Revision 
# Version Date  Summary of Changes  Consent 
Change?  
1 3/28/19  Changes made in response to clarifications 
requested: unbolded payment on recruitment 
postcard, removed date from HIPAA form and 
added detail on how this information is 
confirmed, unchecked pregnant women in 
section 6.3, checked box in 7.1, provided 
further detail on recruitment/social media, 
indicated waiver of cons ent requested, with 
justification, clarified voluntary nature of 
participating in consent document  Yes 
2 4/11/19  Changes made in response to clarifications 
requested: recommended statement added  to 
consent , formatting of protocol template was 
checked/updated as requested, NA was added 
to 6.1 and 6.2, additional details on social 
media use were added, the term de -identified 
was changed to coded throughout, requested Yes 
 Page 5 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/[ADDRESS_347589] was checked/edited as 
requested.  
3 6/28/[ADDRESS_347590] made the following changes: receipts 
will be collected for the household; 
modifications to inclusion criteria – participant 
needs to do 75% of the grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284604] e at least 75% 
of grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284605]’s/Tops; 
changed number of reci pes cards provided (3 
per week) . We also made a few minor 
additions/changes to questionnaire/interview: 
asking how long they were in the store 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; whether they use insulin; how they 
liked the recipes from the study; whether they 
follow a special diet; and a question about their 
liking of several possible recipes. We also 
modified our food frequency questionnaire (to 
ask about the past month rather than year given 
the time frame  of our study) and added a 
receipt form to allow participants to clarify 
what the items on their receipts are. All of 
these changes are included in th e modification 
in tracked changes (in this protocol/the relevant 
attachments).   
4 7/24/19  We made minor changes after internal 
feasibility testing of the protocol. These 
include: removing part of our baseline 
questionnaire (corresponding changes are 
tracked in the protocol and study 
script/questionnaire attachments) and minor 
changes to the script/receipt fo rm to streamline 
procedures, now asking questions about who 
the purchased food items are for on the receipt 
forms rather than the phone interview. We also 
specify our stratification factors in the 
protocol. All of these changes are included in 
the modifica tion in tracked changes (in this 
protocol/the relevant  attachments)   
5 9/16/[ADDRESS_347591] changed the consent procedure to 
include written consent consistent with SOP 
and full HIPAA authorization after challenges 
acquiring participant medical information from 
clinicians. All of these changes are included in 
this modification in tracked changes (in this 
protocol/the relevant attachments).   
 
 
 Page 6 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/19  6  9/30/[ADDRESS_347592] made the following changes: adding 
pre-diabetes/type II diabetes eligibility criteria 
to the fr ont of the recruitment materials (flyer, 
postcard, and Facebook advertisement) to make 
this criteria more visible for interested 
individuals;  modifying our eligibility script to 
align with the SOP  consent/HIPAA form;  
expanding recruitment as described herein 
(collaborating with partners within our 
departmen t, at Independent Health  Foundation, 
I2B2 and Research Match ; adding an additional 
mode of communication with physicians’ 
offices ( fax via eFax.com , to maintain 
confidentiality  because or lab does not have  a 
private fax machine);  adding an option for 
participants to receive  study documents  via 
postal mail if that is their preference. We have 
also made minor changes to eligibility criteria 
where participants must shop at 
Tops/Wegmans at least 50% of the time  
(instead of 75% of the time). A number of 
interested participants were deemed ineligible 
solely because of this criterion, leading the 
study team to review the inclusion criteria and 
their purposes. While it is important that 
participants shop at these st ores regularly, the 
selection of the specific cutoff was somewhat 
arbitrary, and upon revisiting, the study team 
felt that a cutoff of 50% or more would still 
capture the majority of the household’s 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284606]. An additional option was added to the 
screener document to encompass this change in 
eligibility criteria. We have also added a 
question to the screener document asking 
participants if they have  recently  participated in  
(or are currently in)  any other research studies  
and to explain the nature of each study. 
Additionally, we have changed our enrollment 
procedures to allow participants to self -report 
and start  the study before confirming their 
diabetes status with a physic ian. This decision 
was made because of feasibility concerns;  a 
number of eligible participants have not been 
able to enroll in the study as a direct result of  
 Page 7 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/19  extended delays in communication between 
study staff and physician’s offices ; this change 
will allow for faster turnover and study 
progress, while still allowing for the 
confirmation of  diabetes status  later in the 
study . All of these changes are included in the 
modification in tracked changes (in this 
protocol/the relevant attachments)  
7 11/5/[ADDRESS_347593] made the following changes: Addition 
of a joint recruitment postcard and flyer to be 
used by [CONTACT_284647] 
(STUDY00002659 and STUDY00003608) so 
that we may efficiently direct participants to 
the study that might suit them. We have also 
created a shared online questionnaire that will 
be used solely to direct participants to the IRB -
approved online screening questionnaire for the 
aforementioned studies. No personally 
identifiable information will be collected on 
this survey; it is completely anonymous. All of 
these changes are included in the modification 
in tracked changes (in this protocol/the relevant 
attachments)   
 
 
8 12/10/[ADDRESS_347594] made the fol lowing changes: Given 
the remote nature of this study (all participant 
contact [CONTACT_284648], email, or postal 
mail), we have elected to expand our 
recruitment efforts past the Buffalo area to 
include the greater Northeastern US, where 
Tops and Weg mans stores are located. For this 
reason, we have added an additional question 
to the screener asking potential participants to 
input their home zip code; this will help us 
determine whether the participant is within the 
specified distance to Tops and/or W egmans 
stores, and if they are eligible to receive 
Instacart delivery services in their area. We 
have also edited the protocol to specify that 
recruitment will extend beyond the Buffalo 
area to include the Northeastern US.  All of 
these changes are included  in the modification 
in tracked changes (in this protocol/the relevant 
attachments)   
 Page 8 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/19  9 02/20/[ADDRESS_347595] made the following changes: We plan 
to collaborate  with the UB contracted media-
buying agency Fahlgren Mortine  (FM) for 
study recruitment. FM has created a 
customized media plan specific to our study 
objectives, and we have developed a new 
recruitment material for digital display 
advertising. This has been adapted from 
previously approved material to better suit a  
digital display platform, and a user -friendly 
vanity link has been created to direct interested 
individuals to our screening survey (which 
remains unchanged). All of these changes are 
included in the modification in tracked changes 
(in this protocol/the r elevant attachments)   
10 03/12/[ADDRESS_347596] made the following changes to the 
protocol in response to the COVID -19 
pandemic: We will allow study team members 
to work remotely on UBs secure VPN as a 
preventative measure to limit person contact . 
The study t eam has been instructed to maintain 
confidentiality as in the lab setting and to 
perform study tasks in a private space in 
accordance with laboratory emergency 
procedures.   
11 05/04/[ADDRESS_347597] made the following changes: We have 
modified our definition of “at risk for diabetes ” 
after learnin g that few individuals have a 
formal  prediabetes diagnosis. We are still 
interested in recruiting individuals with type [ADDRESS_347598] (described further herein). 
This affects the questions we ask on our 
screening questionnaire and the wording  of 
some of our materials; uploaded attachments 
have been included and described in the 
modification submission. We have also 
extended our study timeline and prepared 
additional language  and measures  in response Yes 
 Page 9 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/19  to the COVID19 pandemic ; these include  
tempering the language about in- person 
grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284607], so that 
it doesn’t feel like it is required if not preferred 
in the context of COVID -19, and adding 
changes in daily life, perceived stress and 
loneliness measures within our baseline and 
post surveys . Additionally, we added 
newspapers and periodicals, and the  Clinical 
and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI) 
Community Liaison and Buffalo Research 
Registry (BRR) to our recruitment methods to 
aid in the recruitment of participants from the 
greater Buffalo community.  We also changed 
the mention of added sugar to sugar and/or 
added sugar throughout the protocol, as we do 
plan to examine at least one of these, but 
realized in beginning our data entry processes 
that examination of added sugar in particular 
may be difficult with the current nutritional 
software/analysis plan.

1.0 Study Summary  
 
Study Title  Improving adherence to a diabetic diet with a grocery 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284608]. Participants will be 
randomly assigned to 1 of 2 interventions or a control group 
in which they will shop in- person as usual.  Stratification 
factors will be sex and diabetes status: diabetic vs. at risk for 
type [ADDRESS_347599] . In all groups, recipe 
cards that follow the evidence -based DASH diet  will be 
provided;  recipes correspond to dietary recommendations for 
patients with  type 2 diabetes or at incr eased  risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_36746] 2 diabetes . The Online  intervention will 
utilize online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_25577] a local grocery 
store via Instacart) to promote healthier purchasing, 
removing visceral factors that can lead to impulse pur chases 
in stores. The Defaults  intervention will augment this 
intervention, showing participants a default cart when they 
log into their accounts. They will be told that their cart has 
been filled with items that conform to a diet for diabetes  
prevention, management , and overall health and can be used 
to make the recipes from the provided recipe cards, and that 
they may modify it as they like.  
At baseline, all participants will complete a survey online or 
via phone and then will grocery shop i n-person as usual. 
Participants will then be randomized and receive further 
instructions. For the next 3 weeks, they will receive recipe 
cards and shop in accordance with their assigned study 
group. The following week (post), they will shop using their 
preferred mode (in -person or online)  and complete a survey 
again. Household r eceipt data will be collected throughout 
 Page 11 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/19  the study. The baseline period will also serve as a run -in 
period, and participants who do not comply with study 
guidelines for baseline procedures (including guidelines for 
receipt submission) will not be randomized for further 
participation. Primary analyses will examine intervention 
effects on grocery purchases, with additional analyses on 
spending and dietary intake. The study is designed, so that 
all participant interactions will occur remotely: online , via 
phone , or through paper mail  (study m aterials  may be sent 
via paper mail if it is the participants preference, and 
Clinc ards for participant payment will initially be sent via 
mail as is standard, using participant addresses as already 
collected on the consent form) .  
Primary Objective  The g oal of this study is to test novel approaches informed 
by [CONTACT_284650][INVESTIGATOR_284609] 2 diabetes or at an 
increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_36746] 2 diabetes . 
Secondary 
Objective(s)  The specific aims  are: (1) to test effects of Online and 
Defaults grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284610] 2 diabetes or at risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_36746] 2 diabetes and (2) to explore effects of the 
Online an d Defaults interventions on participants’ spending 
during grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. We will also explore effects on 
dietary intake.  
Research 
Intervention(s)/ 
Investigational 
Agent(s)  There will be two interventions in this study. The first 
intervention is the On line intervention, which will utilize 
online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_25577] a local grocery store 
via Instacart) to promote healthier purchasing, removing 
visceral factors that can lead to impulse purchases in stores. 
The second intervention, the Defaults  intervention, will 
augment the Online  intervention, showing participants a 
default cart when they log into their accounts. They will be 
told that their cart has been filled with items that conform to 
a diet  appropriate for diabetes prevention, management, and 
overall health  and can be used to make the recipes from the 
provided recipe cards, and that they may modify their carts 
as they like.

Study Specific 
Abbreviations/ 
Definitions   
2.0 Objectives * 
2.1 Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives  of this research . 
Response:  
The goal of this study is to test novel approaches informed by [CONTACT_284651][INVESTIGATOR_284611] [ADDRESS_347602] . The specific aims are: (1) to test effects of Online  and Defaults  grocery 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284612]’ grocery purchases and (2) to explore 
effects of the Online  and Defaults  interventions on participants’ spending during 
grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
2.2 State the hypotheses to be tested , if applicable . 
NOTE:  A hypothesis is a specific, testable prediction about what you expect to 
happen in your study  that corresponds  with  your above listed objectives.  
Response:  
It is hypothesized that (1a) purchases made by [CONTACT_284652], carbohydrates, and sugar (total sugar and/or added sugar ) and 
higher in nutritional quality (DASH diet score) at post -test versus other study 
groups, (1b) adults in the Defaults group will show the greatest increases in 
nutritional quality versus other study groups, (1c) the Online group will have 
intermediary results between Defaults and Controls, and (2) there will be no 
difference in total dollars depic ted on receipts across study groups during the 
intervention period (i.e., the costs of online shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284613]).  
3.0 Scientific  Endpoints * 
 
2.1    Describe the s cientific  endpoint (s), the main result or occurrence under 
study.   
 
NOTE:  Scientific endpoints are  outcomes defined  before the study begins to determine 
whether the objectives of the study have been met  and to draw conclusions from the data.  
Include primary and secondary endpoints.  Some exa mple endpoint s are:  reduction of 
symptoms, improvement  in quality of life , or survival.   Your response should  not be a 
date.   
Response:  
 Page 13 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/19  The primary endpoint is to determine whether there are group differences in 
grocery purchases among adults randomized to the Online or Defaults 
interventions or control group. Primary analyses will examine differences in the 
study groups’ grocery purchases , including total calories, carbohydrates, and 
sugar (total sugar and/or added sugar ), and overall nutritional quality of foods and 
beverages purchased at post -test and throughout the study period.  
4.0 Background * 
4.1 Provide the scientific or scholarly background, rationale, and significance 
of the research  based on the existing literature and how it will contribute to 
existing knowledge.  Describe any gaps in current knowledge.  Include  
relevant pr eliminary findings or prior research by [CONTACT_093].  
Response:  
Millions of deaths are caused by [CONTACT_37110], and impacts on health 
expenditures are staggering, with $[ADDRESS_347603] been applied effectively in many domains (e.g., organ 
donation; Johnson & Goldstein, 2003) but have seldom been used to 
promote health during grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], which is the leading source of 
sugar -sweetened beverages and nutrient -poor foods (An & Maurer, 2016). 
One recent study randomized undergraduates to grocery shop online, 
receiving either: 1) nutrition education, 2) a financial incentive for 
selecting healthy foods, or 3) a default shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284614], 
which they could alter as desired. The default group chose healthier foods 
than education controls, with no effect of incentives. This study supports 
the promise of defaults to encourage healthier purchases when grocery 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284615] a need for ecologically -valid studies in 
populations with diet -related diseases. The present study will fill this gap 
by [CONTACT_284653][INVESTIGATOR_284616] 14 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/[ADDRESS_347604] translational significance as they could be 
incorporated into clinical treatment: e.g., by “prescribing” online grocery 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284617], and/or working with 
dieticians to generate default carts catering to different lifestyles and 
disseminating this information in clinical settings and/or via partnerships 
with grocery stores. As such, the proposed interventions have the potential 
to improve dietary intake, glucose regulation, weight, and medication 
needs among diabetic patients. The study team has the substantive 
expertise needed to examine this question, including a history of 
behavioral economics, diabetes, grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/retail, and community -
based research (e.g., Anzman -Frasca et al., 2018; Epstein & Saelens, 
2000; Leone et al., 2018).

5.0 Study Design * 
5.1 Describe and explain the study design (e.g. case- control, cross -sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, interventional, longitudinal, observational).  
 Page 15 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/19  Response:  
This study has an experimental design. Participants will be randomly assigned to 
1 of 2 interventions or a control group in which they will shop in- person as usual. 
Stratification factors will be sex and diabetes status: type [ADDRESS_347605] . In all groups, recipe cards that 
follow the evidence -based DASH diet and correspond to dietary 
recommendations for diabetic patients will be provided. The Online  intervention 
will utilize online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_25577] a local grocery store via 
Instacart) to promote healthier purchasing, removing visceral factors that can lead 
to impulse purchases in stores. The Defaults  intervention will augment this 
intervention, showing participants a default cart when they log into their accounts. 
They will be told that their cart has been filled with items that conform to a diet  
appropriate for diabetes prevention, management, and overall health and can be 
used to make the recipes from the provided recipe cards, and that they may 
modify it as they like.  
At baseline, all participants will complete a survey online or via phone and then 
will grocery shop in- person as usual. Participants will then be randomized and 
receive further instructions. For the next 3 weeks, they will receive recipe cards 
and shop in accordance with their assigned study group. The following week 
(post), they will shop using the method of their ch oice (in -person, online) and 
complete a survey again. Household r eceipt data will be collected throughout the 
study. The baseline period will also serve as a run- in period, and participants who 
do not comply with study guidelines for baseline procedures (including guidelines 
for receipt submission) will not be randomized for further participation. Primary 
analyses will examine intervention effects on grocery purchases, with additional 
analyses on spending and dietary intake. All participant interactions will occur 
online or via phone.  
6.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
1.1 Description: Describe the study intervention and/or investigational 
agent (e.g., drug, device)  that is being evaluated. 
Response:  
This study does not involve drugs or devices; however, there will be two 
interventions in this study. The first intervention is the Online  intervention, which 
will utilize online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_25577] a local gr ocery store via 
Instacart) to promote healthier purchasing, removing visceral factors that can lead 
to impulse purchases in stores. The second intervention, the Defaults intervention, 
will augment the Online  intervention, showing participants a default car t when 
they log into their accounts. They will be told that their cart has been filled with 
items that conform to a diet  appropriate for diabetes prevention, management, and 
overall health  and can be used to make the recipes from the provided reci pe cards, 
and that they may modify their cart as they like.

estimated 34% of US adults has prediabetes, we anticipate that about [ADDRESS_347607] access to? What perce ntage of those potential subjects 
do you need to recruit? 
Response:  
Participants will be recruited  during 2019- 2020 from the Northeastern United 
States  via one or more of the following methods. Participants will be recruited via 
advertisements in print an d social media, mailings, newspapers and periodicals, 
flyers in clinics and other community locations, and attendance at community 
events and clinics. Prior research by [CONTACT_284655]. With regards 
to social media, the study will be advertised on our lab’s and our Division’s 
Facebook and Twitter pages (UB  Child Health and Behavior Lab, UB Division of 
Behavioral Medicine).  The information will also be posted on our lab’s website 
(http://ubhablab.weebly.com/ ). The attached recruitment advertisement and/or 
postcard will be uploaded/linked to these sites. These are public pages that 
potential participants can view (and “like”/follow in the case of Facebook and 
Twitter) of their own free will. No information will be collected from participants 
by [CONTACT_284656]. The potential participants will be able to read 
the text on the recruitment postcard and decide whether to contact [CONTACT_284657]/or whether to 
access and fill out the study screener, with screening information collected on a 
different platform  (e.g. Survey Monkey)  and protected as indicated herein.   
The study will also utilize the University at Buffalo’s Clinical and Translational 
Sciences Institute (CTSI) for recruitment assistance  and consultation. The CTSI’s 
Recruitment and Community Engagement Team provides resources and guidance 
to link our study with community partners to reach populations of interest. These 
resources include the Buffalo Research Registry (BRR) and Conventus Re search 
Table. The BRR is a voluntary research registry which can connect researchers to 
community members who have completed a health profile and are interested in 
participating in research. These community members have agreed to be contact[CONTACT_284658] -reported information. 
The BRR’s Community Recruitment Liaison (CRL) will complete the process of 
sorting BRR data to reflect the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study, and 
may reach out to potentially eligible participants in the BRR to provide 
information about the study. The CRL will then provide the study team with the 
name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_284659]. No recorded health 
information will be shared from BRR data.  
 
We will collab orate with the UB contracted media -buying agency Fahlgren 
Mortine (FM) for the purposes of study recruitment. FM services include media 
 Page 18 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/[ADDRESS_347608] recruitment materials to better suit the digital display platform. 
This advertisement will be used for print and digital media platforms where 
limited text is appropriate  (e.g. newspaper advertisements, social media). These 
advertisements will be shown in public spaces that potential participants can view 
of their own free will. The potential participants will be able to access the link on 
the advertisement to decide whether to contact [CONTACT_284660]/or whether to access and fill out the study screener, with 
screening informati on collected on a different platform and protected (e.g. Survey 
Monkey) as indicated herein. 
We will also utilize ResearchMatch, a not -for-profit, free recruitment initiative 
that is supported by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical and 
Translati onal Science Award Program grant.  ResearchMatch identifies 
participants from a pool of registered study volunteers that fit within specified 
demographic filters and will email a de -identified group of eligible participants.  
ResearchMatch volunteers are i ndividuals who have self -registered their interest 
to be contact[CONTACT_284661] a good match 
for them. Recruitment access to ResearchMatch requires evidence of having IRB 
approval and only lasts as long as the IRB -study approval. The expi[INVESTIGATOR_284618]. After a researcher 
has been granted recruitment access, they are able to search for appropriate 
matches amongst the non -identifiable Res earchMatch voluntee r pool by [CONTACT_284662]’s criteria into the ResearchMatch search builder. Search criteria will be 
adults living within 20 miles of a TOPS and/or Wegmans . This process will yield 
a list of potential matches, and these individuals will be contact[CONTACT_284663] -
approved recruitment content in an initial recruitment message via a secure 
ResearchMatch system. These potential matches will then have the option to reply 
yes, no, or no response.  
 
In addition, we will share study information with individuals from several 
databases;  first, we will access the contact [CONTACT_60942] a database of 
potentially interested participants maintained by [CONTACT_284664]. Our 
department’s  centralized  database includes hundreds of individuals with 
prediabetes or type II diabetes who indicated interest but did not participate in 
prior studies. In addition, there are several similar but  smaller databases 
maintained by [CONTACT_29569] l abs within our department. These labs also conduct 
studies with type II diabetic  and/or prediabetic  patients, and maintain a list of 
individuals who were interested in participating, but did not meet the eligibility 
criteria for the given study.  We plan to  collaborate with these labs, sharing 
information about our study with these potential participants who indicated an 
interest in hearing about other study opportunities, and also sharing information 
about these colleagues’ studies with individuals who were  interested in, but not 
 Page 19 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/[ADDRESS_347609] participants to the study that might suit them, a shared online 
(Qualtrics) questionnaire will be used that asks participants questions about their 
height and weight, diabetes/prediabetes status, if they are taking medications for 
blood glucose management, hypertension, or high cholesterol, if they are 
interested in weight loss, if they shop at local grocery stores, and if they are on 
public assistance. No personally -identifiable information will be collected on this 
survey; it is completely anonymous and it will only be used to direct participants 
to the IRB -approved online screening questionnaire for the aforementioned 
studies. Research staff within the Division of Beha vioral Medicine have used the 
database successfully for multiple years for recruitment purposes, and we feel 
confident that we can recruit the required number of subjects from this database 
and our online and community based efforts. Additionally, [CONTACT_284691] an-Frasca 
has experience conducting research within and recruiting from community 
settings and has recruited similarly -sized samples within similar time frames.  
 
We will also utilize the I2B2 dashboard, a secure, HIPAA compliant database 
maintained by [CONTACT_284665]. In addition, we have previously collaborated with Independent Health 
Foundation on research, and our colleagues there have indicated their willingness 
to share information about this st udy in two ways: 1) with contacts from their 
database, and 2) via the Brook app. With regard to the latter, our colleagues at 
Independent Health Foundation are collaborating with Brook 
(https://www.brook.health/ ), encouraging Independent Health members who are 
diabetic to download the app to help track and manage their diabetes. Study 
information can be sent to these individuals via the app. Similar to our outreach 
via the other methods described above, potential pa rticipants who receive study 
information through these avenues will be able to read the recruitment text and 
decide whether to contact [CONTACT_284666]/or whether to access and fill out the study screener, 
with screening information collected on a different platform  (e.g. Survey 
Monkey)  and protected as indicated herein.   
 
Efforts will be made to recruit  low-income individuals (e.g., by [CONTACT_284667] -income census tracts of Buffalo  and/or connecting 
with clinic locations in these tracts). Even though we are excluding SNAP/WIC 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_284619], there are low -income individuals who do not meet 
eligibility criteria  for these programs or who do not sign up for these programs 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_284620]. Participants will provide informed consent prior to 
participation.

eligible for, the present study.  Two other  IRB-approved studies within the 
Division of Behavioral Medicine, STUDY00002659 and STUDY00003608, are 
recruiting pre -diabetic and type II diabetic participants . To minimize the 
likelihood participants screen for multiple projects in the lab, and in order to 
efficiently direct participants to the study that might suit them, a shared online 
(Qualtrics) questionnaire will be used that asks participants questions about their 
height and weight, diabetes/prediabetes status, if they are taking medications for 
blood glucose management, hypertension, or high cholesterol, i f they are 
interested in weight loss, if they shop at local grocery stores, and if they are on

for about 17 months. Recruitment and data collection will occur on a rolling basis, 
with individual participants’ involvement be ing for about 6 weeks. All data will 
be collected online or via phone.  
Following completion of initial screening, participants will complete consent 
procedures and a HIPAA form for their physician to confirm their 
diabetes/prediabetes diagnosis , or specif ic health characteristics that increase their 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_36746] [ADDRESS_347620]  [see Consent  and HIPAA form].  
Physicians will be contact[CONTACT_284677]; this may include 
phone, email, fax  via efax.com , or in- person communication). Participants  will be 
mailed their Clincard for participant payment and move on to baseline 
procedures : a questionnai re [See attachment: Questionnaires], a baseline shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284626], and a brief phone interview with questions about their 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_137077] [See attachment: Phone interview]. Any participant who does not 
follow guidelines for baseline procedures will not proceed to randomization (but 
will be compensated for their time, as detailed below).

Following their baseline shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_137077], participants will submit a ph otograph of 
their household receipt s via email  and of a receipt information form (attached) . 
Study staff will contact [CONTACT_284678] s are 
not received within the time frame discussed during consent procedures. When 
the photos are  received, study staff will mail participants their Clinc ards to be 
used for participant payments and will contact [CONTACT_284679] -up questions and share with participants their assigned study group [See 
attachment: Phone in terview].  
Participants will be randomized in blocks to the Online, Defaults , or Control  
group, stratifying by [CONTACT_284680] ( diabetes  vs. increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_284628] 2 diabetes ). Study staff will consult a pre -populated spreadsheet  in order to 
determine the study group of each participant. Participants in the Online and 
Defaults groups will receive instructions on how to access an online grocery 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284629] ( www.instacart.com ). Instacart is a platform 
through which customers can grocery shop online and have their groceries 
delivered within a designated window. Many leading grocery retailers offer 
grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284630], including Tops and Wegmans, both of which are 
based in Western [LOCATION_001]; there are approximately 250  locations of these 
chains throughout the  Northeastern [LOCATION_002] , including but not limited to: 
[LOCATION_001], New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and [LOCATION_005] .   
Accounts will be set up for the participants by [CONTACT_464], with shared access. 
Participants will enter their credit/debit  card information and purchase their own 
groceries, to enhance ecological validity. Only the last 4 digits of the participant’s 
credit or debit card number will be  visible to study staff when accessing the 
account to download receipt data ( Online and Defaults groups) and populate the 
default cart ( Defaults  group). During the 3 weeks that follow randomization, 
Control  group participants will be asked to shop as they normally would, in-
person at Tops or Wegmans. Those in Online  and Defaults  groups will be asked 
to shop as they normally would but using their grocery store’s Instacart platform. 
In addition, the Defaults  group will be told that their cart will be pre -filled with 
items that conform to a diet appropriate for diabetes management, prevention, and 
overall health . The items will correspond to the DASH diet. All participants will 
receive 3 DASH- diet friendly recipe cards each week, and the items in the 
Defaults  group’s carts will correspond to the recipes. The default cart will be 
populated by [CONTACT_284681] -populated to 
prepare for the next purchase each time the participant completes a shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_137077]. 
During the post -test week, all participants will be asked to shop using the method 
of their choice (in- person, online); no default carts or recipe cards will be given. 
At post -test participants will also complete a Food Frequency Questionnaire as 
well as an Exit Quest ionnaire (see attachment: Questionnaires).  
Based on inclusion criteria, we expect each participant to shop at least once 
during each of the three intervention weeks; participants can shop more than once 
per week if this is what they typi[INVESTIGATOR_158834]. Either wa y, they will be instructed to 
continue to submit their receipts from all household grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284631] 30 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/19  Tops/Wegmans via email as done at baseline. Participants will be prompted 
weekly, reminding them to shop as they normally would and to ask whether the 
household has completed any shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284632]. 
Participants will also be asked about foods purchased from other locales during 
phone interviews following submission of receipts each week (See attachment: 
Phone interview). Although re ceipts are downloadable from Instacart in the 
intervention groups and weeks, we will collect these receipts from participants as 
well, for consistency and as an indicator of the extent to which the number of 
submitted receipts corresponds to the number of actual receipts, to further inform 
feasibility for subsequent larger -scale work.  
12.2 Describe what data will be collected.   
NOTE:  For studies with multiple data collection points or long- term follow up, 
consider the addition of  a schedule or table in your response . 
Response:  
Data to be collected include:  
*Confirmation of diabetes status  or diabetes risk status  (see attachments:  Consent 
and HIPAA Form)  
*Demographic questions collected at baseline (see attachment: Questionnaires)  
*Changes in daily routine, perceived stress and loneliness questions at baseline 
(see attachment: Questionnaires)  
*Calories, carbohydrates, sugar (total sugar and/or added sugar ), and food groups 
each week of the 5 -week shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_266420], from receipts (see additional details 
below)  
*Information on which purchased items will be consumed by [CONTACT_284682] (administered after each shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_137077], see attachment: Phone 
interview)  
*Dollars s pent on groceries at each time point, from receipts (each week)  
*Dietary intake from a Food Frequency Questionnaire (see details below and 
attachment: Questionnaires; collected at post- test) 
*Exit questionnaire (completed at the end of the study; see attac hment: 
Questionnaires)  
Additional details: 
Calories, carbohydrates,  sugar (total sugar and/or added sugar ), and food groups 
will be generated from each of the five weeks of receipt data using Nutritionist 
Pro software. Each item on the receipt, as well as the item quantity and weight, 
will be entered into the software following procedures from Hollis -Hansen et al. 
(Hollis -Hansen, Seidman, O’Donnell, & Epstein, 2018). Standard values from the 
USDA will be entered in the case of any missing information as done previously. 
Nutritional quality will be examined using the DASH diet scores based on the 
amount of 8 food types encouraged or discouraged by [CONTACT_284683] (e.g., fruits, 
 Page 31 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/19  vegetables, sweetened beverages). Methods previously used to calculate DASH 
diet sco res from intake data will be adapted for use in this context.  
The food frequency questionnaire is used to calculate nutrient intake. It is a 
structured self -administered questionnaire with pre -specified response options.

NOTE:  Privacy refers to a n individual’s right to control  access to him or herself.  
Privacy applies to th e person.  Confidentiality refers to how data collected about 
individuals for the research  will be protected by [CONTACT_10758].  
Confidentiality applies to the data.   
Examples of appropriate responses include:  “ participant only meets with a study 
coordinator in a classroom setting where no one can overhear ”, or “ the 
participant is reminded that they are free to refuse to answer any questions that 
they do not feel comfortable answering.”    
Response:   
The recruitment procedures described in this protocol make use of posted flyers 
web postings , and secure databases of interested potential participants – methods 
approved by [CONTACT_284685] . With regards to public postings, 
participants may call the laboratory or complete the online scre ening 
questionnaire of their own free will, and thus are controlling access to their 
privacy.  
Other participants will be recruited using secure databases  of interested 
participants maintained by [CONTACT_284686] , Independent 
Health , the Center for Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI) and I2B2.Potential 
participants have signed up for these databases of their own free will. All 
recruitment details will be kept confidential and private. During the initial phone 
or online screening, data  will be collected in the secure laboratory environment 
and will be recorded within password- protected files, to which only select staff 
have access. All information will be treated in strict confidence to the extent 
provided by [CONTACT_67204].  
All study data will be stored on a secure password -protected server, UBBox, 
and/or external hard drive locked in a cabinet in a secure room (151 Farber). Only 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_284635]. Personally 
identifiable information will be  stored separately from coded  data. A file linking 
participant identities with participant ID numbers will be stored separately from

should they so choose.  
18.2 Indicate how the research team is permitted to access any sources of 
information about the subjects.   
NOTE:  Examples of appropriate responses include:  school permission for review 
of records, consent of the subject, HIPAA waiver.   This question does  apply  to 
records reviews.  
Response:   
 Page 36 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/19  Participants will indicate their consent after reviewing consent forms and having 
the chance to ask the study team any questions. A HIPAA authorization will be 
completed before the research team can access medical info rmation about 
participants’ diabetes status  and/or diabetes risk status  (See attachment:  Consent 
and HIPAA form ). Then, HIPAA forms will be used to collect information 
needed to access information about participants’ diabetes status  and/or diabetes 
risk status . Physician s will be contact[CONTACT_284677]; this may 
include phone, email, fax, or in- person communication.  
19.0 Data Management  and Analysis * 
19.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.  This 
section applies to both quantitative and qualitative analysis.  
Response:  
Linear mixed models will be used to test effects of the interventions on total 
calories, carbohydrates,  sugar (total sugar and/or added sugar ), and nutritional 
quality of grocery purchases, with study group, time, and their interaction as 
factors. Primary comparisons will be between -groups comparisons of these 
variables at post -test. We will also examine whether these variables differ overall 
by [CONTACT_284687]. We 
will conduct each analysis once for the total cart and then again examining these 
variables relative to household size and for items that the respondent indicated 
they would be consuming. We will conduct parallel analyses with total dollars 
spent each week and with DASH diet scores as outcomes to examine effects on 
spending and intake. We will also explore whether effects differ for participants 
with prediabetes vs. diabetes and whether results change when adjusting for food 
purchases beyond the target stores. Finally, we will test for relationships between 
purchases (calories, carbohydrates, and sugar (total sugar and/or added sugar )) 
and intake (DASH diet scores).  We will also exp lore whether results differ when 
considering shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284637] (vs. all trips for the 
household). 
19.2 If applicable, provide a power analysis.   
NOTE:  This may not apply to certain types of studies, including chart/ records 
reviews, survey studies, or observational studies.  This question is asked to elicit 
whether the investigator has an adequate sample size to achieve the study 
objectives  and justify a conclusion.  
Response:  
To estimate the sample size needed for this study, ef fect sizes from the most 
similar existing study were used: a proof -of-principle study examining the effects 
of defaults, incentives, and education strategies on healthfulness of grocery 
purchases among undergraduate students (Coffino & Hormes, 2018, Obesit y). 
Based on the observed differences in calories purchased at post -test between 
defaults and education control groups (Cohen’s d=0.96), 15 participants would be 
needed for the primary comparison in the present study, with alpha=.05 and 
power=.80. We repea ted this analysis using the difference between controls and 
 Page 37 of 52  IRB Version : 1/23/19  the prior study’s intermediary group (incentives; Cohen’s d=0.44) to conduct a 
more conservative sample size calculation, given our interest in detecting effects 
on purchasing between our intermediary group ( Online ) and the other groups. 
This calculation yielded a sample size of 54. We increased this to account for 
participants lost during the run- in period (i.e. failure to confirm diabetes 
diagnosis, failure to complete baseline procedures) as wel l as participants lost due 
to attrition, with a plan to enroll up to 100 participants.   
19.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected 
data. 
Response:  
Some data will be entered directly by [CONTACT_4317] (online questionnaires). All 
other study data will be entered by [CONTACT_32341]: study staff will enter participant 
responses into online forms while phone screening/phone interviews are 
completed. Study st aff will also enter information from receipts into 
NutritionistPro (e.g., nutrition information) and Microsoft Excel (e.g., dollars 
spent) for analysis of study aims. Entered data will be double entered and/or 
checked for quality control.

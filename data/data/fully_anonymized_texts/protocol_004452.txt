precluded the calculation of cumulative incidence rates, which were replaced by [CONTACT_455341]. The analysis of recurrent falls was analyzed using the same method 
as the other recurrent event outcomes, i.e., a practice- level Poisson model with an offset for

 STUDY SUMMARY  (revised 7/31/2018)  
 
Title RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF A MULTIFACTORIAL FALL INJURY 
PREVENTION STRATEGY  
Study Design  The design is a cluster randomized, parallel group superiority trial with 
practices stratified by [CONTACT_455342].  The unit of randomization is the practice.  
Study Duration  6 years 
Trial Sites  10 trial sites: The Partners’ Health Care System; Essentia; Hopkins 
Health Care System; HealthCare Partners; Reliant Health Care 
System; Mount Sinai Health Care System; University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_455322]; University of [LOCATION_007] Medical Branch Health Care 
System; University of Iowa Health Care System; University of Michigan 
Health Care System.      
Objective  Cond uct a cluster -randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of an 
evidence- based, patient -centered multifactorial fall injury prevention 
strategy.  
Number of Subjects  The original target sample size was 6,000 participants enrolled from 86 
practices to provide 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the rate of the primary outcome with intervention relative to control. Later, the 
duration of the trial was extended to a total of 40 months (20 months of 
recruitment and an additional 20 months of follow -up), which reduced 
the target sample size to 5,322 participants.  Recruitment ended after 
20 months on March 31, 2017, with a total of 5,451 participants 
enrolled.   
Main Inclusion 
Criteria  Community -living persons, 70 years or older, who are at increased risk 
for serious fall injuries.  
Intervention  An evidence -based patient -centered intervention that combine s 
elements of a multifactorial, risk factor -based, standardly -tailored fall 
prevention strategy developed at Yale, practice guidelines offered by 
[CONTACT_6750]' s "STEADI" toolbox and the joint American Geriatrics 
Society/British Geriatrics Society guidelines, and ACOVE practice 
change approach.  
Duration of 
Intervention  A minimum of 20 months and a maximum of 40 months.  
Primary Outcome  The primary outcome is ser ious fall injuries, operationalized as  a fall 
resulting in: (1) (fracture other than thoracic/lumbar vertebral; joint 
dislocation; or cut requiring closure) AND any medical attention; OR (2) 
(head injury; sprain or strain; bruising or swelling; or other) r equiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Primary Analysis  The risk of any serious fall injury (i.e., time to first event) will be 
analyzed using a survival model that incorporates competing risks (due to death) and clustering. In this analysis, participants who are los t to 
follow- up without a prior serious fall -related injury will be censored at 
their date last seen. In a secondary analysis, we will adjust for the pre -
specified set of baseline covariates to examine their influence on the 
intervention effect.

  Secondary 
Outcomes  Number of falls, number of all fall injuries, and measures of well -being.  
Adaptive 
Components  Adaptive components of the trial  include: 1) monitoring the accrual 
rate to determine whether the study eligibility criteria need to be 
reconsidered if  recruitment is lower than expected, taking into account 
that any changes could affect the inferences; 2) monitoring the potential 
for ascertainment bias because of interactions between the FCMs and 
study participants and changing the primary outcome definition if 
necessary; 3) monitoring the primary outcome rate to determine 
whether the outcome needs to be adapted, e.g., from time to first 
serious fall -related injury to time to all recurrent serious fall -related 
injuries if the former rate is too low, affecting the power of the study;  4) 
interim monitoring for efficacy or futility, if necessary; and 5) refining the 
analytic methods based on the validity of the assumptions; such an 
adaptation will be done blinded to treatment, e.g., if the death rate is 
low, competing risks could be considered as a secondary, rather than a 
primary, analysis.  
Interim Analysis  Interim monitoring will focus on patient accrual, baseline comparability 
of treatment groups, protocol adherence, data completeness and 
quality, accrual of fall events, safety, and efficacy or futility.

 1. BACKGROUND  
 
Approximately one in three older Americans falls each year and 20- 30% of those who fall suffer 
moderate to severe injuries such as lacerations, hip fractures, or head trauma. The problem is 
important particularly among those [ADDRESS_582034] funded jointly by [CONTACT_455343] (PCORI) is a multi -site cluster randomized clinical trial 
(RCT) of an evidence- based, multifactorial individually -tailored intervention to reduce the risk of 
serious fall injuries among non- institutionalized older persons.  
 
 
2. AIMS  
 
1. To conduct in partnership with patients and stakeholders a cluster randomized trial of 
the intervention in a sample of 6,000 participants from 80+ practices  in [ADDRESS_582035] geographic and sociodemographic diversity. The trial will 
include features of an adaptive design, to facilitate “learning”, including a pre-specified, mid- term analysis.  
2. To identify and evaluate jointly with patient s and stakeholders the obstacles and 
facilitators of the post -trial scalability, sustainability, and dissemination of the fall 
injury prevention strategy.  
 
 
3. STUDY DESIGN  
 
STRIDE is designed as a cluster randomized, parallel group superiority trial with practices 
stratified by [CONTACT_455344]. The unit of randomization is the practice to avoid the potential for contamination of controls, which could occur more easily if 
randomization was at the level of the participant or physician. The primary outcome is time to 
first serious fall injury assessed at the patient level. The original target sample size was [ADDRESS_582036] a 20% reduction in serious fall injuries in the 
intervention group versus control group with 90% power. The target sample size was revised to 
5,322 in December 13, 2017; r ecruitment ended after 20 months on March 31, 2017, with a total 
of 5,451 participants enrolled.

 STRIDE was designed with the following adaptive features:  
 
 
1. Monitoring the accrual rate to determine whether the eligibility criteria should be altered if 
enrollment is lower than expected (e.g., by [CONTACT_455345]);  
2. Monitoring the potential for ascertainment bias because of inte ractions between the 
FCMs and study participants and changing the primary outcome definition, if necessary;  
3. Monitoring the primary outcome rate to determine whether the outcome needs to be 
adapted, e.g., from first serious fall injury to all serious fall i njuries if the former rate is too 
low, affecting the power of the study;  
4. Interim monitoring for efficacy and futility , if necessary ; and  
5. Refining the analytic methods based on the validity of the assumptions; such an adaptation will be done blinded to tr eatment, e.g., if the death rate is low, competing 
risks could be considered as a secondary, rather than a primary, analysis.

 4.1 Primary Outcome  
 
The primary outcome is serious fall injur ies leading to medical attention, including non- vertebral 
fractures, joint dislocation, head injury, lacerations, and other major sequelae (e.g., 
rhabdomyolysis, internal injuries, hypothermia). A fall is defined using the traditional definition of 
a person unintentionally coming to rest on the ground or other lower  level not as a result of a 
major intrinsic event (e.g. myocardial infarction or stroke) or an overwhelming external hazard 
(e.g. hit by a vehicle). The following will not be included as falls: a controlled or intentional 
movement to a chair or bed; a "nea r fall" in which the participant caught himself or herself 
before hitting the floor, ground, or object; and being knocked down by a substantial external force, like a moving vehicle. Fall injuries from height > 3 feet will not be included.  
 The definition of the primary outcome was modified on 6/1/[ADDRESS_582038] the recommendations 
of the Ad Hoc Expert Panel established by [CONTACT_455348]’s concurrence with this 
recommendation. The definition of a serious fall injury was adapted to:  
 
A fall resulting in:  
(1) fracture other than thoracic /lumbar vertebral; joint dislocation; or cut requiring closure 
AND any medical attention;  
OR 
(2) head injury; sprain or strain; bruising or swelling; or other requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 The original definition only required medical  attention for a head injury; sprain or strain; bruising 
or swelling; or other  – not a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 4.2 Secondary Outcomes  
 
The secondary outcomes include all fall injuries and all falls (regardless of injury) , as well as 
indicators of well -being. All fall injuries include serious fall injuries as well as less severe falls 
that result in bruises, cuts, persistent pain, and restricted activities, but not necessarily medical attention. The four indicators of well -being are: fall efficacy, physical functi on/disability, anxiety, 
and depressive symptoms  administered by [CONTACT_455349]. The indicators of 
well-being will be measured at 12 and 24 months in a random subsample of 720 participants. 
The random subsample will be selected from year 1  enrollees to permit 24 month assessments 
within the t rial duration of 3 years.   
 
4.3 Tertiary Outcomes  
 
The tertiary outcomes include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455323]- term nursing home admissions.  
 5. RANDOMIZATION  
 
5.1 Method of Randomization  
 
All participating clinical practices that met trial eligibility criteria were randomized at one time 
using covariate -constrained randomization with stratification by [CONTACT_68566] (healthcare system) 
to control for potential site differences. Covariate- constrained randomization was used to 
balance practice characteristics within and across the clinical sites (strata). The balancing 
 STRIDE SAP  
 
10 
 covariates were practice size, geography (urban vs. rural), and race/ethnicity (primary 
identification nonwhite vs. white).  
 
A published SAS macr o was used to conduct the covariate- constrained randomization 
(Chaudhary and Moulton, 2006 ; Greene , 2017). The macro generates a set of randomizations 
that satisfy balance on practice size, geography and race/ethnicity both within and across strata. 
From t his set of valid assignments, one was  selected at random. Only the trial biostatisticians 
participated in the generation of the randomization. No one else from the trial was involved in 
the process. To minimize the risk of selection bias, practice site nam es were masked during the 
process. The practice site randomization assignments to treatment groups were released to the clinical sites only after careful vetting of the entire randomization process by [CONTACT_455350] . 
 
Practices will not be added after trial initiation. All available practices that met our eligibility 
criteria have been carefully vetted and have c ommitted to the trial. The criteria included: 
sufficient number of age eligible patients (≥ 400), access to community resources (specifically, 
exercise programs), access to electronic health records (EHR) and availability of practice 
characteristics. Thus,  additional practices are not readily available. The participating practices 
have more than enough age eligible patients (> 80,000) to meet the original target recruitment 
goal of 6 ,000 patients, assuming a conservative 10% enrollment rate, which is reasonable 
based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9958]. If a randomized practice drops out of the trial, we expect to 
ascertain study outcomes in individual participants since follow -up is being conducted centrally.  
 
5.3 Allocation Concealment  
 
An important consideration, partic ularly in cluster trials, is allocation concealment to control for 
selection bias. Potential approaches include 1) randomizing after enrollment, 2) blinding the recruiters, 3) standardizing the enrollment process with adequate training of screeners and 
recruiters, and 4) covariate adjustment in the analysis. Because enrollment must occur after 
practices have been randomized in STRIDE, the first approach is not feasible. However, the 
possible effects of selection bias will be mitigated through approaches [ADDRESS_582039] 
serious fall injury was 18% (95%CI: 14% -24%); a preliminary estimate of the overall serious fall 
injury rate (including recurrent events) was comparable, at 21% (95%CI: 16% -24%). For the 
proposed trial , we project an annual outcome rate in the control group of 14% to 18%, since fall 
injuries will be assessed every three months rather than monthly, and our protocol requires that serious fall injuries be confirmed by [CONTACT_455351].  
 STRIDE SAP

Data from the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study  and Assessing 
Care of Vulnerable Elders Practice Redesign for Improved Medical Care for Elders 
(ACOVEprime) were also examined in order to inform the outcome rate, but LIFE had  a lower 
risk population and ACOVEprime primarily used Medicare claims data to ascertain fall rates . 
Data from MOBILZE [LOCATION_011] and LIFE were used to help inform the loss and death rates. The 
annual loss rate in the absence of serious fall injury was 4% in M OBILIZE [LOCATION_011], but this study 
did not have access to claims or EHR data. The rate in LIFE was less than 2% in 728 patients 
aged 75 years and older. The annual death rates in the absence of serious fall injury were less 
than 2% for both MOBILIZE [LOCATION_011] and the LIFE Study. Because the MOBILIZE [LOCATION_011] rate 
was based on only a few number of deaths and the LIFE Study enrolled a lower risk population because the intervention included an exercise component, we assumed a higher death rate for 
STRIDE.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_582040] serious fall injury (the 
primary outcome) based on the logrank statistic in the presence of competing risk due to death. Table 2 presents s ample size estimated using PASS version 12 (Kaysville, Utah)  under t he 
following assumptions :  
 
1. type I error = 5% (2 -sided) and 90% power;  
2. a trial duration of 3 years with accrual periods of 1, 1.5 and 2 y ears (assuming uniform 
accrual) ;  
3. equal allocation to in tervention and control groups;  
4. no adjustment for non -adherence to intervention (accounted for with conservative 
treatment effect);  
5. all patients followed to end of the trial (max = 3 y ears);  
6. a 20% reduction in serious fall injuries with intervention relative to control, assuming 
constant and proportional hazards.  [This reduction, which would have considerable 
clinical and public health impact, is intermediate between that found in Yale FICSIT 
(31% reduction in all falls) and Connecticut Collaborative Fall s Program (CCFP) (9% 
reduction in serious fall injuries), two prior multifactorial fall prevention studies. Because many aspects of our intervention will be implemented at the level of the patient (as in 
FICSIT) rather than geographic region (as in CCFP), our effect size should be closer to 
that of FICSIT than CCFP, making the sample size estimates given here conservative.]  
7. 7% annual death rate without experiencing a serious fall injury (i.e., competing risk);  
8. 3% annual loss to follow -up rate in the absenc e of serious fall injury or death (expected 
to be low due to the use of multiple sources, including claims and medical records data; 
9. 3% inflation for the proposed interim monitoring for efficacy and futility;  and  
10. 53% inflation for the design effect of clustering, assuming an average of 70  participants 
enrolled per practice from 86 practices and an ICC of 0.0076 estimated from an analysis of serious fall injuries in the LIFE Study.  
 Based on Table 2 , a target sample size of 6000 participants was selected to be accrued from 86  
practices, each enrolling an average of 70  participants over a 1.5 -year recruitment period. This 
sample size provided  90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the hazard rate with intervention

On December 13, 2017, a protocol amendment was approved extending the duration of the 
study from 36 months (18 months of r ecruitment and a minimum 18 months of follow -up) to 40 
months (20 months of recruitment and a minimum of 20 months of follow -up). The target sample 
size was adjusted to 5,322 participants for a 40 -month study instead of  6000 participants for a 
36-month study.  Recruitment ended after 20 months on March 31, 2017, with a total of 5,451 
participants enrolled.

6.3 Power for Secondary Outcomes  
 Power for all fall injuries and all falls (regardless of injury) was calculated using the same 
assumptions as above, but with a 1% Type I error to control for multiplicity and no adjustment 
for interim analysis. Annual rates of first fall and first fall injury from MOBILIZE [LOCATION_011] are 0.92 
(95%CI: 0.75, 1.10) and 0.57 (95%CI: 0.46, 0.69), respectively. Using conservative rates of 0.70 
and 0.40, and based on the targeted sample size of 6000, power is > 99% to detect a 20% 
reduction with intervention relative to control for both of these secondary outcomes. For the 
indicators of well -being, an unadjusted sample size of [ADDRESS_582042] size of 0.3 between intervention and control at 1 and 2 years with 80% 
power and 1% type I error. The sample size adjusted for missing outcomes due to death 
(10%/y ear) and lost to follow -up (5%/y ear with or without a serious fall  injury), and for clustering 
(DE = 6% assuming ICC = 0.0076 with 86 practices each enrolling 8 participants) is 720 (360 per group), a 12% subsample of the 6000 participants to be accrued during year 1 of the trial.

 7. INTERIM MONITORING PLAN  
 
7.1 Overview  
 
Interim monitoring will focus on patient accrual, baseline comparability of treatment groups, 
protocol adherence, loss to follow -up, data completeness and quality, sample size assumptions, 
accrual of fall events, safety, efficacy, and futility. The summary of the types of tables, listings 
and figures (TLFs) generated for semi -annual open and closed DSMB reports is presented in 
the Appendix  A. The final Interim Monitoring Plan (dated May 17, 2017) is given in Appendix B  
and was approved by [CONTACT_455352] 31, 2017 meeting.  
 
7.2 Trial Adapt ation Guidelines  
 
Adaptive design features proposed  in the protocol include: 1) monitoring the accrual rate to 
determine whether the study eligibility criteria need to be reconsidered if recruitment is lower 
than expected, taking into account that any changes could affect the inferences; 2) monitoring 
the potential for ascertainment bias because of interactions between the FCMs and study 
participants and changing the primary outcome definition if necessary; 3) monitoring the primary 
outcome rate to determine whether the outcome needs to be adapted, e.g., fr om time to first 
serious fall -related injury to time to all recurrent serious fall -related injuries if the former rate is 
too low, affecting the power of the study;  4) interim monitoring for efficacy or futility, if 
necessary; and 5) refining the analytic  methods based on the validity of the assumptions; such 
an adaptation will be done blinded to treatment, e.g., if the death rate is low, competing risks 
could be considered as a secondary, rather than a primary, analysis.  
Any adaptations will be presented to the DSMB for their review and approval prior to 
implementation. The DCC will designate an independent (unblinded) statistician for reporting to 
the DSMB in closed session. The independent statistician will not be involved in any 
operational issues in the trial once it is initiated. Only the independent statistician, along with 
the statistical programmer, will have access to the link between coded (A vs. B) and actual 
treatment assignment (intervention vs. control). All other DCC and trial personnel will remain 
blinded to the actual treatment assignment.  
 
Any adaptation of eligibility criteria because of inadequate recruitment will be based on analyses 
of aggregate baseline screening data to determine the reasons for study ineligibility. Since these 
data a re obtained at baseline and prior to the initiation of treatment, the analyses can be 
considered to be unbiased. It is expected that the study leadership will be involved in this type of 
adaptation.  
 
Adaptation based on a lower than expected primary outcom e rate will be done using aggregate 
data and presented to the DSMB in closed session by [CONTACT_164762]. No other 
DCC or trial personnel will be privy to these data because knowledge of the outcome rate could 
affect any operational decisions f or the trial.  
 
Any interim analyses for efficacy and futility will be presented in closed session to the DSMB by 
[CONTACT_164762]. Treatments will be designated as A vs. B. The independent 
statistician will have access to the actual treatment assignment during the closed session, if 
requested by [CONTACT_4318]. No one else associated with the trial will be privy to these data.  
 
 STRIDE SAP

 Refining the Statistical Analysis (SAP) plan will be done blinded to treatment by [CONTACT_455353]. If the  outcome is changed the DCC statisticians will need to be aware 
of the change, in addition to the independent statistician, in order to be able to appropriately 
revise the SAP.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_582043] of clustering using a 
variance inflation factor (VIF)  approach . That is, the inflation in variance for the treatment effect 
for the model with clustering vs. the model without clustering. This approach was used because 
of the complexity of the analytic model, a clustered survival model with competing risk due to 
death, and the lack of a closed form ICC for this model.  The VIF wa s determined by [CONTACT_455354].  
 7.4 Monitoring of Efficacy and Futility  
 
Per RFA, a “preliminary statistical analysis of the effects of the preventive strategy on the rate of 
serious fall injuri es must be reported in March 2017.” At this time, recruitment will have ended 
and about 55% of the expected number of primary events will have been accrued, sufficient for 
an interim look. The expected number of events is based on the ratio of average foll ow-up time 
at the interim look ( 1.25 y ears)  relative to the average total follow -up time for the study (2.25

stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_455325] (~p<0.008) or a trend in 
the wrong direction (i.e., futility) taking into account trends in secondary outcomes. Future looks will be left to the purview of the DSMB based on emerging trends in the data; however, by 
[CONTACT_11711] 2017, there will be less than one year left in the trial and it may be impractical to conduct 
another interim look before it ends in February 2018. Interim monitoring boundaries will be 
established using an alpha spending approach using EAST version 6.13 (Cytel) software 
(Jenni son and Turnbull, 2000; Proschan, Lan and Wittes, 2006) . A prototype figure is given in

In addition to formal sequential monitoring boundaries, estimates of conditional power will be 
provided to assess the likelihood of reaching a significant conclusion at the end of the trial given 
the observed data (Lan and Wittes, 1988).

8 ANALYTIC PLAN  
 
8.1 Overview  
 The analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes will be according to the principle of intent -
to-treat, i.e., practices/participants will be analyzed according to their original treatment 
assignment rega rdless of adherence to protocol . All analyses will account for the cluster design 
with the participant as the unit of analysis. SAS 9.[ADDRESS_582045] atistics 
and multivariate methods. The randomization is designed to produce balance on important covariates at the practice level (unit of randomization) but not necessarily at the patient level. 
Therefore, in a secondary analysis, the following pre- specif ied set of baseline covariates will be 
selected for adjustment to determine their influence on the treatment comparisons: age, race/ethnicity, education, number of chronic conditions, and number of positive screening items 
(out of three) for serious fall i njuries  (Senn, 1989).   
 Note: Sections 8.3 –  8.5 were revised to provide more analytic detail  than presented in 
version 1. 0 of the SAP , including more recent statistical advances. The revised plan is 
consistent w ith the original analytic plan. The trial protocol has been revised 
accordingly .

Subgroup analysis: The  effect of intervention will be evaluated in the following prespecified 
subgroups of partici pants using appropriate tests of homogeneity (e.g., interaction) : age (70 -79,

2+ chronic conditions), and hip fracture or other fracture since age 50 (yes/no) ]. The Hochberg

overall type I error of 5% (2- sided).  
 
 Cumulative incidence rates:  The cumulative incidence of first serious fall injur y will be

STRIDE Trial  
Interim Monitoring Plan  
May 17, 2017  
 
Introduction  
The STRIDE study was designed as an adaptive trial. Originally, the adaptive components of the trial 
included: 1) monitorin g the accrual rate to determine whether the study eligibility criteria need to be 
reconsidered; 2) monitoring the primary outcome rate to determine whether the outcome needs to be 
adapted, e.g., from time to first serious fall- related injury to time to all recurrent serious fall- related 
injuries if the former rate were too low; and 3) interim monitoring for efficacy and futility. The original 
proposal envisioned an interim look in March 2017, but that date was considered unrealistic because of the trial’s late start and the accrual of insufficient numbers of adjudicated events by [CONTACT_163529]. Accordingly, the sponsors and the DSMB left the exact timing and content of the interim monitoring to 
the discretion of the investigators. In its November 2016 meeting, the trial’s DSMB directed the study 
team to present an interim monitoring plan for consideration of the DSMB in its May 2017 meeting.  
 In response to the DMSB, the study team has prepared this document describing the Interim Monitoring Plan ( IMP) for the N IA/PCORI- funded Strategies to Reduce Injuries and Develop Confidence in Elders 
(STRIDE ) Trial. The IMP is specifically intended to assist the STRIDE Trial DSMB in forming 
recommendations concerning ongoing trial progress and potential design changes. Speci fically, it 
focuses on three critical decision points for review over the next year: (i) change in the primary outcome 
definition; (ii) extension of follow -up or adaptation of the primary endpoint to a more inclusive “all 
events” implementation to maintain  study power; and (iii) cessation or continuation of trial procedures 
as informed by a futility analysis.    
 
Organization of the IMP  
 
The IMP is divided into three stages to address the following issues:  
 
 Stage 1.  Evaluation of whether the primary outcom e definition should be changed to address the 
potential for ascertainment bias resulting from differential rates of referral for medical 
care in the setting of a fall  
 Stage 2.  Evaluation of event accumulation and decision to extend follow -up or adapt the primary 
outcome to recurrent events  
2a. Monitoring the cluster design effect  
2b. Monitoring the accrual of adjudicated primary study outcomes in the control group  
2c. Considerations to extend follow -up to maintain study power for first serious fall 
injury (SFI) or adapt the primary outcome from first SFI to all SFI  
 Stage 3.  Timing and nature of the planned interim analysis.  
 
 STRIDE SAP  
 
22 
 These issues are complex and need to be addressed before taking a formal “look” at the intervention 
effect for efficacy/futility and  must be done blinded to outcome data by [CONTACT_65237]. All analyses 
to implement the IMP will be performed by [CONTACT_455359]. A brief description of each 
stage follows.  
 
Stage [ADDRESS_582048] serious fall injury to all serious fall injuries required? As part of this stage, we will consider the estimate of the cluster design effect needed to determine the inflation to sample size 
(number of events) required to account for clustering.  
 
Stage [ADDRESS_582049] SFI to recurrent SFI  Winter/Spring 2018 DSMB meeting  
Interim look  After Fall 2018 DSMB meeting, if extension of 
follow -up is required and feasible; otherwise, 
conduct one look at the data at the scheduled 
end of trial in November 2018.  
 A flow diagram of the decision -making process is presented in Figure 1.  
 Stage 1.  Changing the Primary Outcome Definition (Fall 2017 DSMB Meeting)  
 For the primary analysis in STRIDE, a serious fall injury event is defined as a fall accompanied by [CONTACT_455360].  The injuries are classified as either Type 1 (definitive injuries such 
as fracture or joint dislocation) or Type 2 (potentially less serious injuries, such as muscle strains). It is expected that Type [ADDRESS_582050] referred to this as a potential ascertainment bias.  
 
A proposal to change the primary outcome definition to address the potential concern about ascertainment bias was previously circulated to the DSMB (Supplement 1). Specifically, the proposal is to 
restrict the definition of Type 2 fall injuries (head injury; sprain or strain; bruising or swelling; or other) 
to require an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455327]. This would leave unchanged 
all Type 1 injuries (i.e., fracture other than thoracic or lumbar vertebral; joint dislocation; or cut 
requiring closure) as well as Type II injuries requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Because of the DSMB’s concerns 
about making a recomm endation on this issue after reviewing unblinded data, NIA and PCORI will 
appoint a working group of the DSMB that will be blinded to intervention assignment. The DSMB will approve its membership. The group will review the outcome event rates under both de finitions (current 
and restrictive) in the control group and, based upon criteria defined in this plan, will make 
recommendations to NIA and PCORI about changing the primary outcome definition. The DSMB will be 
informed of the recommendations, but a decisi on about whether to change the outcome will be made 
by [CONTACT_455361]. At the Fall 2017 DSMB meeting,  the DSMB, but not its working group advising on the 
outcome definition, will be provided data by [CONTACT_455362].  
 
Assessment of Ascertainment Bias . We will focus on patient -reported type 2 injuries (head injury; sprain 
or strain; bruising or swelling; or other) without an accompanying type 1 injury. We define Type 2a 
injuries as those requiring a h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Type 2b as those that do not require a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455328] 2c as those in which no medical attention was sought. Patient -reported events are used for the assessment of ascertainment bias bec ause Type 2c 
events are not adjudicated. The proportion (p) of Type 2b events in intervention and control groups will be calculated. The denominator for the proportion can be all Type 2 events (2a + 2b + 2c) or only Type 2b and 2c. The difference in propor tions with 90% confidence intervals will be calculated and reported. 
We propose a higher type I error rate for calculation of confidence intervals to provide for greater control of type [ADDRESS_582051] study  power even when 
differences are small. The strategy for assessing the latter is outlined below.   Although it is possible that the intervention might “turn a Type 1 event into a Type 2 event,” this effect should be negligible relative 
to the potential asc ertainment bias.  
 
Potential Effect of Ascertainment Bias on the Study Power . Using the proportions for intervention (p i) 
and control (p c), we will estimate the “excess” (i.e., due to ascertainment bias) number of Type 2 events 
in the intervention arm by [CONTACT_455363]. expected number of Type 2b events. The 
projected number of excess type 2b events in the intervention arm can be approximated by  
 
(Observed number of Type 2b events in control) x (hypothesized ratio of events: intervention relative  to control) x (p
i/pc –1). 
   
 STRIDE SAP  
 
[ADDRESS_582052] ratio 
of 0.80 with 90% power is 844: 382 intervention vs. 462 control, or a ratio of 0.827. Thus, an excess of 11 
events in the intervention arm from 382 to 393, decreases the po wer to 80% for an annual control event 
rate of 0.14.  
 
Control Event Rates . If there is evidence of ascertainment bias, we will calculate the observed first event 
rate in the control arm (while blinded to the overall rate for both groups combined) under bot h the 
protocol and modified definitions of the primary outcome. By [CONTACT_455364] 2017 DSMB meeting (November-
December), the trial will have accrued at least 60% of the total person years of follow -up (PYF, see 
section 2b and Table A). We assume generation of ev ents will mirror PYF; however, there will be a lag in 
adjudicated events. Thus, rates will be calculated using patient -reported events and compared with the 
hypothesized control event rate of 0.14 for 90% power and/or 0.10 for 80% power using the lower 95%  
exact 1 -sided confidence limit.  
 
Proposed Algorithm for Changing Primary Outcome Definition . The proposed algorithm is presented in 
Figure 1 and briefly summarized as follows:  
 
• No evidence of ascertainment bias: retain original definition  
• Evidence of asc ertainment bias and control event rate for revised definition > 10%: change to 
revised definition  
• Evidence of ascertainment bias and control event rate for revised definition < 10%: calculate 
power under diluted intervention effect from ascertainment bias for the protocol definition vs. power under revised definition and choose outcome with least effect on study power.  
 Stage 2. Evaluation of Event Accumulation and Decision to Extend Follow -up or Adapt the Primary 
Outcome to Recurrent Events (Winter/Spring 2018 DSMB Meeting)  
 
2a.
  Monitoring the Cluster Design Effect  
 Cluster randomized trials require an inflation to sample size (target number of events) to account for the correlation among patients within a cluster. The target number of events in STRIDE was  first calculated 
for an unclustered design and then inflated for interim monitoring and the cluster design effect, which is a function of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and number enrolled per practice. The number of events for an uncluste red design with a hazard ratio (HR) = 0.80 and 90% power is 844. This number 
was inflated by 1.[ADDRESS_582053] primary events of 1321 = [ADDRESS_582054] was estimated based on an 
ICC of 0.0076 from the LIFE trial, assuming clinical practices  as clusters, and constant number 
enrolled/practice of 70 as 1 + (70 -1)(0.0076). The design effect needs to be re- estimated for STRIDE 
because there was wide var iability in the number enrolled per practice, and the ICC was estimated from 
LIFE, which randomized participants and not sites. Because there is no closed form estimate of the ICC for the complexity of the STRIDE trial design (i.e., a clustered survival trial with a competing risk of death), we will estimate the design effect using a variance inflation factor (VIF) method (i.e., variance for the intervention effect for the clustered model relative to the unclustered model), and then use the VIF 
 STRIDE SAP  
 
[ADDRESS_582055] adjudicated SFI. Because adjudication of outcomes will lag behind the accrual of patient reported SFI, an estimate of the conversion rate (with 95% confidence intervals) will be calculated from the accumulated data, i.e., proportion of reported events in which adjudic ation has 
been completed (i.e., resolved) that meet the definition of a primary study outcome. Separate 
conversion rates may need to be estimated for the different types of SFI (Types 1 and 2). The conversion 
rate will be used to estimate the projected num ber of adjudicated first SFI at the end of the [ADDRESS_582056] SFI rate and the projected total person years of follow -
up (PYF) accounting for censoring due to deaths and losses. The observed patient reported fir st SFI 
event rate will be estimated as the number of observed patient- reported first SFI divided by [CONTACT_455365]. The projected adjudicated events will then be estimated as:  
 
Projected adjudicated SFI = observed first patient reported SFI rate x projected total PFY x 
adjudication conversion rate.  
 
A comparison of the projected number of adjudicated events with the target number of control events 
(723), after accounting for the estimated ICC, for 90% power (or, if necessary, 540 events for 80% 
pow er) will be used to assess whether an extension of follow -up is needed and for how long a duration 
(see 2c below).   As a supportive strategy, we will also calculate the control event rate. A control event rate of 0.14/year was assumed in the sample size c alculations for 90% power; a rate of approximately 0.10/year is needed 
for 80% power. The sample size calculations also assumed a 7% annual death rate (competing risk) and 3% annual loss to follow -up (censoring) rate. We propose a cumulative incidence rate  calculation (with 
95% confidence intervals) that considers the censoring and competing risk rate, instead of the Kaplan 
Meier rate which counts losses and deaths as independent censoring. If the lower bound for the 
observed rate is greater than the hypoth esized control rate of 0.14 for 90% power or 0.10 for 80%, then 
there is some assurance that the study is on target for 80%/90% power to detect the hypothesized 
effect, a hazard ratio of 0.80.  
  2c. Extending Follow -up or Adapting the Primary Outcome from  First SFI to All SFI to Maintain 
Study Power  
 If the generation of adjudicated control outcomes (first events) is too low to maintain study power at a minimum of 80%, there are two options: 1) extend follow- up for first SFI or 2) adapt the primary 
outcom e from first adjudicated SFI to all adjudicated SFI (i.e., recurrent events). The decision regarding 
these options needs to be made before an interim look. Extension of follow- up for first SFI is the 
preferred option because it preserves the primary outcom e and has fewer analytical challenges than

Stage 3.  Timing and Nature of the Interim Look (At or After Fall 2018 DSMB Meeting)  
 
Based on the above timeline, we propose the following sequence and types of looks at the data.

stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_455329].  
Fall 2018 meeting  No extension of follow -up; trial 
ends as planned after [ADDRESS_582060] futility analysis based on 
conditional power for the observed, null and hypothesized trend. If power is < 50% for the observed trend, consider 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_455329]. Otherwise , 
continue for one final look at the end of the trial. Note, look follows, and is not part of, the decision to extend 
follow -up.

Appendix A  
Estimating the “Excess” N umber of Type 2 Events in the Intervention Arm Due to Potential 
Ascertainment Bias  
 
Define Type 2a injuries as those requiring a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Type 2b as those that do not require 
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455330] 2 c as those in which 
no medical attention was sought.  
 Let P
i = proportion of observed Type 2b injuries in the intervention arm = I 2b/D where D could 
equal I 2b + I2c or I 2a + I2b + I2c.  
Pc = proportion in control arm  
 Let E = excess number of Type 2b injur ies in intervention arm.  
 When there is no ascertainment bias P
i = P c and then 
 
(I2b – E)/D  = P c 
 Note, the denominator is not adjusted by E because we are assuming a shift in events from I
2c 
to I 2b because of medical attention; the overall number of even ts remains unchanged.  
 Solving for I
2b  
  I
2b = P c*D + E         (1) 
 From P
i = I2b/D solving for D gives  
  D = I
2b/Pi         (2) 
 Substituting (2) into (1) and solving for E gives  
  E = I
2b*(1 – Pc/Pi)        (3) 
 E is the excess number of Type 2b events  in the intervention arm potentially due to 
ascertainment bias under the assumption that the proportion of Type 2b events is the same in 
intervention and control. The observed number of Type 2b injuries in intervention and the 
proportions are needed for this calculation.  
 
 STRIDE SAP  
 
[ADDRESS_582061]. The latter would be taken as the hypothesize ratio of events in intervention vs. control 
(almost equivalent to the hazard ratio).  This ratio is based on t he target number of primary 
outcomes in intervention relative to control detect a hazard ratio of 0.80 with 90% power: 382 
intervention vs. 462 control, or a ratio of 0.827.  
 
Thus, the excess can be expressed as  
  E = Observed I
2b – expected I 2b        
 Where expected = C
2b x hypothesized ratio of events (R = .827). Therefore  
  E = I
2b – C2b*R          
  Solving for I2b             
  I
2b = E + C 2b*R         (4) 
 Substituting (4) into (3) and solving for E gives  
  E = C
2b*R*(P i/Pc – 1)        (5) 
  
Thus, either equation (3) or (5) could be used to determine the excess number of Type 2b events in the intervention arm accounting for potential ascertainment bias. Equation (3) uses 
the observed number of Type 2b events in the intervention arm and equation (5) uses the 
number in the control arm and the hypothesized ratio of events for intervention relative to 
control under 90% power = 0.827.  
 The projected excess number of events can be used to assess its impact on the power of the 
trial using the observed control event rate and the hypothesized hazard ratio of 0.80.

 Background and Statement of Problem  
 
According to the current STRIDE protocol, the primary outcome of serious fall injury is defined as “a fall leading to medical attention, including non -vertebral fractures, joint dislocation, head injury, 
lacerations, and other major sequelae (e.g., rhabdomyolysis, internal injuries, hypothermia)”.  
 
These fall- related injuries can be classified into two types:  
Type 1 : fracture other than thoracic or lumbar vertebral; joint dislocation; or cut requiring closure; 
and  
Type 2 : head injury; sprain or strain; bruising or swelling; or other.  
 
Over the past 6 months, as the operational details of the STRIDE intervention, particularly those related 
to interactions between the fall care manager (FCM) an d study participants, became more fully 
developed, a concern was raised about the strong potential for differential bias in the ascertainment of 
the primary outcome between the intervention and control groups, especially for the Type 2 injuries.   
 
As part  of the intervention, participant interactions with the fall care managers (FCMs) could lead to 
differential medical attention, particularly for the subset of “ type 2”  injuries – head injury, sprain or 
strain, bruising or swelling, or other –  that are insu fficiently severe to require a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Because 
receipt of medical care is an inherent part of the primary outcome definition, any factor that 
differentially causes participants to obtain medical care in one treatment arm versus the other could 
bias estimates of the difference in outcome rates between the arms.  If manifest, this bias would dilute 
the overall treatment effect, reduce the trial’s power, and threaten the validity of the trial’s findings.  
 
To address the concern about potential ascer tainment bias, the study team has developed a plan to 
adapt the primary outcome definition.  
 
Proposal to Adapt the Primary Outcome  
 Under this adaptation, the definition of the Type 2 fall injuries would require an overnight 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455331] y medical attention.  Hence, the adapted definition of serious fall injuries 
would include:  
 
a fall resulting in:  
(1) (fracture other than thoracic or lumbar vertebral; joint dislocation; or cut requiring closure) 
AND any medical attention;  
OR 
(2) (head injury; sp rain or strain; bruising or swelling; or other) requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 Part 1 of this adapted definition of serious fall injury is unchanged from the original definition.   
 
We considered also including emergency department (ED) visits for the Type 2 injuries  (in addition to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) , but decided against it, as described in the Appendix  under “Alternative Approach”.  
 
 STRIDE SAP  
 
33 
 Rationale for Proposed Adaptation in the Primary Outcome  
 
We are concerned about including fall injuries in which seeking medical attention may be discretionary, since the decision to seek medical attention may be influenced by [CONTACT_3038]’ interactions with the FCM.  For example, as part of the intervention, participants are encouraged to call their FCM about any 
recent falls , but only after any acute injuries resulting from the fall have been addressed.  This 
notification allows the FCM to modify the treatment plan, if needed.  As described in the Appendix  
under, “ Plans to Reduce Differential Fall- related Use of Medical Servi ce”, we have implemented a plan 
to provide all participants with a handout on “What to do in case of a fall”, which describes the steps 
that the participant should take in the event of a fall, which may reduce the likelihood of the participants calling the ir FCM or the Recruitment and Assessment Center ( RAC) immediately after a fall.  
In addition, intervention participants will be advised not to call the FCM for acute injuries arising from a fall.  However, it is possible that some patients may still call t he FCM in the setting of an injury, and that 
these interactions may lead participants to seek medical attention with their primary care provider 
(PCP), at an urgent care center, or an emergency department.  In addition, some participants may not 
know wheth er some fall- related injuries warrant medical attention and could be prompted to seek 
medical attention after an interaction with their FCM.  Because there would be no such interactions with control group participants, the decision to seek medical attentio n for some injuries could be differential, 
biasing ascertainment of the primary outcome, thereby [CONTACT_455366].  
 
We consider other serious injuries –  i.e. “ type 1” –  fractures, dislocations, or cuts requiring closure or 
type 2 injuries leading to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] –  to be less susceptible to this potential bias because of their 
comparatively definitive nature and severity.  Because Type 2 injuries can differ greatly in  their severity, 
they are much more susceptible to referral bias.  Requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455332] 2 injuries 
would greatly reduce any referral bias since the decision to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455333]’ intera ctions with the FCM. Requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455334].  
 However, this adaptation will likely result in a lower first serious fall injury rate (hypothesized to be 0.14 
per year in the control group) , thereby [CONTACT_455367]. Based on calculations 
presented under “Statistical Considerations” in the Appendix , it appears that , within the range of event 
rates we consider , power may be more sensitive to ascertainment bias (original definition) than to lower 
event rates ( modified  definition); thus, preserving the treatment effect is likely a better strategy to 
optimize power than preserving the event rate .   
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_455335], there are no good a priori  data to es timate the level of this 
potential bias. The intervention could also shift the distribution of outcome events to less severe injuries 
(e.g. a fall that might have led to a hip fracture [type 1] results instead in a soft tissue injury [type 2] but not hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059]) and dilute the treatment effect under the current protocol definition of the primary 
outcome. Because of these concerns, we present two strategies (primary and supportive) that can be monitored to inform a decision about whether or not the prim ary outcome definition should be adapted 
to protect against dilution of the treatment effect. The strategies depend on generating reliable data in a sufficient time frame (prior to the interim look , which is currently scheduled  for March 2017) to guide any  
decision about adaptation.  
 STRIDE SAP

For this discussion, there are 3 sets of type 2 injuries: (1) those that require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
(2) those that lead to medical attention but do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; and (3) those that do not lead 
to any medical atte ntion.  
 
Primary Strategy: Monitor the Event Rate in the Control Arm under the Protocol and Modified Definitions  
 
We would use the accumulating trial data to estimate the event rate in the control arm under both the 
protocol and modified definitions of the primary outcome. In consultation with the DSMB, we would 
consider adapting to the modified definition if its corresponding control event rate is comparable to the 
hypothesized control event rate of 0.14 for 90% power and/or 10% for 80% power (e.g., lower 9 5% 
exact 1 -sided confidence limit is greater than the hypothesized rate); otherwise, we would retain the 
current primary outcome definition. Such an adaptation would be based on actual trial data; since only data from the control arm would be evaluated, blinding to treatment effects would be maintained. This strategy would protect against dilution of the treatment effect because of ascertainment bias. It would also provide some assurance that the event rate would be sufficiently high to maintain power if th e 
intervention was effective.  
 
Based on current and projected future recruitment rates, we estimate that there will be approximately 1000 patient years of follow -up in the control group by [CONTACT_5638] 2016 or very early in 2017 (see Figure 
A), after adjust ing the time -line to account for a [ADDRESS_582063] lower 95% confidence li mit of 0.14 for 90% power would be 
exceeded with an annual control event rate of 0.16, and the limit of 0.10 for 80% power would be exceeded with a control event rate of 0.12 (Table A). These criteria could be used as a basis for determining guidelines for  adapting the primary outcome definition. Because the generation of 
adjudicated outcomes will lag (see Appendix , “Time Required to Adjudicate Primary Outcome”), it will 
be necessary to estimate event rates based both on all patient- reported events and proj ected 
adjudicated events.  The latter will be calculated using a conversion factor based on the rate of self-reported falls becoming definitive (i.e. adjudicated) serious fall injuries and the rate of definitive serious 
fall injuries ascertained through ut ilization data and other non -patient -reported sources of data.  
 
Supportive Strategy: Estimate the Proportion of Nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_455336] 2 Injuries Leading to  Other Medical 
Attention in each Treatment Arm  
 The supportive strategy is designed to determine whether a scertainment bias is occurring as postulated.  
For this strategy, we focus on type 2 injuries (without an accompanying type 1 injury) that do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and we determine the proportion of these type 2 injuries for which other 
medical atte ntion was sought.  For each fall injury, data are being collected during the every 4 -month 
follow -up interviews about whether the participant  saw a doctor or other health care professional for 
his/her injury  and whether the injury resulted in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191]. Based on this information, it will be 
possible to identify falls that were associated with nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_455337] 2 injuries in the presence or absence 
of other medical attention. Thus, in principle, all nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_455338] 2 fall injuries, whether or not the y 
resulted in medical attention, can be captured. From these data we could then:   
 
 STRIDE SAP  
 
35 
 (1) Estimate the proportion of nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_455337] 2 injuries that were associated with other  medical 
attention in the intervention and control arms.  
(2) Potentially repeat (1)  stratified by [CONTACT_455368] 2 injury (e.g. head trauma, soft tissue 
injury), recognizing that the number of events used in these analyses may be limited.  
 
If the proportion of nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_455337] 2 injuries requiring other medical attention is h igher in the 
intervention group than control group, it would provide some evidence for the postulated bias. The 
stratification described in (2) would help to guard against an apparent difference because of the 
intervention (e.g., interaction with the FCM) influencing the distribution of injury types within the type [ADDRESS_582064].  
Language from the original RFA did not provide an operational definition for serious fall injury.  Rather, 
the RFA indicated that careful attention should be paid to “developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a readily interpretable, 
operational definiti on of serious fall- related injuries, such that these events can be ascertained and 
verified efficiently with a high degree of accuracy.”  
 
We believe that our recommendation to adapt  the original operational definition of serious fall injury 
has the potenti al to  reduce referral/ascertainment bias, increase the validity of the trial, and enhance 
power  by [CONTACT_455369].  Furthermore, Type 2 injuries that result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455339] a po licy perspective.   
 Should the primary outcome be adapted, w e also recommend that (1) the original operational definition 
of serious fall injury be included as a secondary outcome:  a fall resulting in (fracture other than thoracic 
or lumbar vertebral; jo int dislocation; or cut requiring closure; head injury; sprain or strain; bruising or 
swelling; or other) AND any medical attention and (2) Type 1 and Type 2 events be evaluated separately 
in a secondary analysis.

 Page 3 of 41  1.0 Objectives 1.1 Purpose, Objectives, Specific Aims Our prior work demonstrates that older people with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) have greater functional impairment and faster functional decline compared to those without PAD (1-4). PAD-related functional limitations are associated with increased healthcare costs and loss of independence (5-10). Yet few medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_707825].  People with PAD have impaired endothelial function, impaired calf muscle perfusion, reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial activity, and reduced calf muscle mass and strength (11-20).  Preliminary pre-clinical and human evidence show that cocoa and its major flavanol component, epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], have therapeutic properties that reverse the pathophysiologic impairments that are present in PAD.  Specifically, cocoa and epi[INVESTIGATOR_707826], increase skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, increase skeletal muscle angiogenesis, reduce skeletal muscle levels of myostatin, and increase skeletal muscle levels of follistatin (21-31).  Myostatin is a growth differentiation factor that promotes muscle wasting.  Follistatin blocks myostatin’s action, thereby [CONTACT_707866].  By [CONTACT_707867], epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa has potential to increase muscle mass and strength (22,25).  A small study in humans with type 2 diabetes and heart failure showed that epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, increased mitochondrial cristae abundance, and improved grip strength (25).  A small randomized cross-over trial in PAD patients showed that dark chocolate (>85% cocoa), but not milk chocolate (<35% cocoa), acutely increased treadmill walking time, improved endothelial function, and reduced oxidative stress two hours after chocolate ingestion (31).  However, no randomized trials have studied whether chronic daily epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa improves walking ability in patients with PAD.    The COCOA-PAD Study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_99633]-blind, randomized controlled trial to test our hypothesis that epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa improves endothelial function, increases calf skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and biogenesis, and favorably alters skeletal muscle levels of myostatin, follistatin, and mitochondrial transcription factor-alpha (TFAM), thereby [CONTACT_707868].  If our proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_707827], results will be used to design a large, definitive randomized clinical trial of epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa in older people with PAD.    Forty-four participants with PAD age 60 and older will be randomized to epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa vs. an epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-free and cocoa-free placebo (matched in appearance and taste) daily for six months.  Our primary 
 Page 4 of 41  outcome is the six-minute walk, a well-validated measure of walking endurance in PAD (32-34).  Secondary outcomes are pain-free and maximal treadmill walking performance, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), accelerometry-measured physical activity, calf muscle biopsy measures, and MRI-measured calf muscle perfusion. To distinguish between the acute vs. chronic effects of cocoa, the six-minute walk and brachial artery FMD measures will be obtained while off of study beverages for 2.5 hours (acute) and 24 hours (chronic), respectively. .  The treadmill stress test will be measured while off of study beverages for 48 hours. Remaining outcomes will be measured while still taking study beverages whenever possible.   Primary Aim.  Among 44 participants with PAD age 60 and older, we will determine whether epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa daily for six months improves six-minute walk performance compared to placebo.  Secondary Aims.  1. Among 44 participants with PAD age 60 and older, we will determine whether epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa daily for six months improves maximal and pain-free treadmill walking time, increases brachial artery FMD, and increases accelerometer-measured physical activity compared to placebo.  2. Among 44 participants with PAD age 60 and older, we will determine whether epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa daily for six months favorably improves the following measures obtained with calf skeletal muscle biopsy: activity of Cytochrome C Oxidase (COX) and citrate synthase, calf muscle levels of peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), capi[INVESTIGATOR_95168], myostatin, follistatin, and mitochondrial transcription factor-alpha (TFAM), compared to placebo.  3.  Among 44 participants with PAD age 60 and older, we will determine whether epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa daily for six months increases calf skeletal muscle perfusion, measured by [CONTACT_9252] (MRI), compared to placebo.  4. Among participants with PAD age [ADDRESS_961846] of satellite cell number and activation state and centrally nucleated and embryonic myosin heavy chain-expressing fibers.  Specific measures of calf skeletal muscle oxidative stress will be nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE).    Exploratory Aims.  Among participants with PAD age 60 and older randomized to epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa, we will determine whether the degree of improvement in six-minute walk performance and treadmill walking performance, respectively, is correlated with the degree of improvement in a) calf skeletal muscle perfusion; b) calf skeletal muscle measures of 
 Page 5 of 41  regeneration; and c) calf skeletal muscle measures of oxidative stress.    1.2 Hypotheses. We hypothesize that: 1. PAD participants randomized to epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa will achieve greater increases in six-minute walk performance at six-month follow-up, compared to those randomized to placebo. 2. PAD participants randomized to epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa will have greater increases in treadmill walking time, brachial artery FMD, and physical activity at six-month follow-up, compared to placebo. 3. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa will improve each calf skeletal muscle measure listed above, compared to placebo.  4. PAD participants randomized to epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa will achieve greater increases in MRI-measured calf muscle perfusion at 6-month follow-up, compared to those randomized to placebo. 5. PAD participants randomized to epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa will have more favorable changes in each calf muscle biopsy measure, compared to those randomized to placebo.  2.[ADDRESS_961847] greater functional impairment and more rapid functional decline than those without PAD (1-5).  The functional impairment in PAD is associated with loss of independence, increased mortality, and poor quality of life (6-10,35).   Few medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_707828].  Only two medications, pentoxifylline and cilostazol, are FDA-approved for treating PAD-associated walking impairment.  Of these, pentoxifylline is usually ineffective and benefits from cilostazol are modest (36-39).  New therapi[INVESTIGATOR_707829].    2.[ADDRESS_961848] smaller calf muscle area, increased calf muscle fat content, and poorer leg strength compared to people without PAD (19,20,40,41).  Greater severity of these calf muscle impairments are associated with greater functional impairment and increased mobility loss in PAD (41-43).  Second, electron microscopy 
 Page 6 of 41  demonstrates pathologic changes in myofibrils, mitochondria, and sarcolemma of calf myofibers in patients with PAD (16,44,45).  More severe oxidative stress, such as that associated with walking-related ischemia reperfusion of calf muscle, is associated with more severe myofiber damage (44).  Third, PAD patients have reduced calf muscle mitochondrial energy production, measured by [CONTACT_707869] (ATP) production, compared to people without PAD (44-50). Lower ATP production is associated with greater functional impairment in PAD (18,44).  Fourth, people with PAD have impaired endothelial function compared to people without PAD. Greater endothelial function impairment in PAD is associated with lower physical activity and increased cardiovascular events (11,12,51).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa targets all of these pathophysiologic changes that are present in PAD.    B. A5.  Pre-clinical evidence suggests that cocoa-derived epi[INVESTIGATOR_707830].  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_26916] a flavanol that exists in high concentrations in cocoa.  In pre-clinical studies, epi[INVESTIGATOR_707831].  First, Hutteman and colleagues studied 21 rats randomized to one of three groups:  Group 1:  epi[INVESTIGATOR_27026] 30 days; Group 2: epi[INVESTIGATOR_27026] 30 days followed by 15 days with no therapy; Group 3:  Placebo.  At 30 day follow-up, Group 1 had increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function, measured by [CONTACT_707870]-1α, TFAM, mitochondrial cristae quantity, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_95168] (21).  PGC-1α is a key promoter of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function.  TFAM increases mitochondrial transcription.  Greater mitochondrial cristae provides greater surface area for ATP production.  These favorable changes were sustained at 45 day follow-up in Group 2, 15 days after therapy was completed.  Second, Gutierrez-Salmean and colleagues administered 1 mg/kg daily of cocoa-derived epi[INVESTIGATOR_707832] (6 months old) and ten old (26 months old) mice (22).  At two-week follow-up, skeletal muscle levels of myostatin were reduced in the young and older mice by 15% and 21%, respectively, while skeletal muscle levels of follistatin increased by 56% in the older mice (22).  Myostatin is a protein and growth differentiation factor that promotes muscle wasting.  Follistatin blocks myostatin’s action, increasing muscle growth.   Thus, cocoa-derived epi[INVESTIGATOR_707833].  Third, Nogueira and colleagues randomized 25 mice into one of four groups for 15 days:  Group 1:  Water alone; Group 2:  Water plus exercise; Group 3: cocoa-derived epi[INVESTIGATOR_27002]; Group 4:  cocoa-derived epi[INVESTIGATOR_707834] (23).  The groups receiving epi[INVESTIGATOR_707835], TFAM quantity, mitochondrial cristae abundance, treadmill running ability, and mitochondrial activity, compared to mice receiving water alone (23).  Groups receiving epi[INVESTIGATOR_707836].  In summary, preclinical evidence shows that epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], the major flavanol 
 Page 7 of 41  component of cocoa, increases mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial function, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_707837].  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_707838].  C. Preliminary evidence from humans without PAD suggests that epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa improves mitochondrial function, increases muscle mass, and improves strength.  Taub and colleagues administered chocolate squares and cocoa beverages daily for three months to five patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure (age 41 to 71 years) (25).  Total daily epi[INVESTIGATOR_707839] 100 mgs.  In thigh muscle biopsies, nitric oxide, PGC-1α, TFAM, and mitochondrial cristae volume all increased following cocoa treatment.  In a separate uncontrolled trial, Gutierrez-Salmean administered cocoa-derived epi[INVESTIGATOR_707840] 6 healthy young people (mean age 28.5 years) and 6 older healthy people (mean age 62) (22).  Plasma levels of myostatin decreased, follistatin increased, and grip strength improved following epi[INVESTIGATOR_26994].  These preliminary studies in humans support our hypotheses that cocoa and epi[INVESTIGATOR_707841], muscle mass, and strength.  However, these studies were limited by [CONTACT_707871].  Further evidence is needed.       D. Dark chocolate acutely improves endothelial function and treadmill walking in PAD.  Loffredo and colleagues randomized 20 PAD patients (mean age 69 years) to 40 grams of dark chocolate (>85% cocoa) vs. 40 grams of milk chocolate (<35% cocoa) in a single-blind cross-over study (31). Two hours after ingesting dark chocolate, increases were observed in treadmill walking time (124.8 + 60.8 to 142.2+62.0 seconds, P<0.001), brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) (2.3%+2.2% to 6.3%+2.7%, P<0.001), and nitric oxide (11.0 umol/L+5.8 to 17.3 umol/L+5.8, P=0.001).  Milk chocolate ingestion did not affect any of these outcomes.  These data demonstrate an acutely beneficial effect of dark chocolate in PAD.  However, the effect of chronic daily administered dark chocolate on clinically important outcomes in PAD is unknown.  In summary, pre-clinical evidence and small human studies show that cocoa and the cocoa-derived flavanol, epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], target key pathophysiologic abnormalities in people with PAD  that are linked to functional impairment in PAD (21-28,31).    2.3 Scientific background and significance of research based on existing  literature.  A. PAD is common and is associated with increased functional impairment and faster rates of functional decline compared to people without PAD.  PAD affects 10-15% of community dwelling men and women age 60 and 
 Page 8 of 41  older (52-54) and will be increasingly prevalent as the U.S. population survives longer with chronic disease.    B.  Cocoa is the dried and fermented seed from theobroma cacao, from which chocolate is made (see photo to left).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_707842], a major ingredient of cocoa, that have therapeutic effects on skeletal muscle and the vasculature (21-30).    In pre-clinical models, cocoa and/or its major flavanol, epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], promote skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, increase capi[INVESTIGATOR_384335], improve endothelial function, and reduce ischemia/perfusion injury (21-24).  Cocoa and/or its major flavanol, epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], also increase muscle mass and strength by [CONTACT_707872] (21,23,25).  Pathophysiologic impairments in PAD that can be targeted by [CONTACT_707873][INVESTIGATOR_26874]-enriched cocoa are described below.  Innovation of the research.  A. Cocoa therapy has never been studied as a chronic, daily therapy for PAD.  Patients with PAD have reduced calf muscle mitochondrial energy production, reduced calf muscle mass and strength, and impaired endothelial function (13-20,40,41).  Cocoa and epi[INVESTIGATOR_707843], increase mitochondrial biogenesis, increase skeletal muscle mass and strength, and improve endothelial function (11-20).  Thus, chronic, daily epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa has the potential for benefit in PAD.  B.  The COCOA-PAD Study will measure the effects of chronic daily epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa on changes in calf muscle biopsy measures and endothelial function in PAD.  Calf muscle biopsies and brachial artery FMD at baseline and follow-up will delineate biologic pathways associated with improved walking performance in PAD.  Our calf skeletal muscle measures of TFAM, follistatin, and myostatin have never been studied before in people with PAD.  C.  The study of therapeutic properties of a food-derived product is innovative.  This study has potential for far-reaching implications, since cocoa is widely accessible and acceptable to people with PAD. If the hypotheses of our proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_707844], a large definitive trial will be warranted.   Justification for proposed dose.  Our intervention is a dark cocoa beverage, naturally rich in epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], manufactured by [CONTACT_707874].  Previous human study suggests that approximately 70 to 100 mgs of epi[INVESTIGATOR_707845], mitochondrial function, and strength (22,25).  For example, in the study by [CONTACT_707875] 9 of 41  described in section A16 (25), the cocoa intervention contained 100 mgs of epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874].  We will prescribe three servings per day of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa beverage, providing 75 mg daily of epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874].  The Hershey’s Company also produces a cocoa-free placebo drink that is packaged identically and appears and tastes identically to the cocoa beverage and has nearly identical nutritional content, including calories. Each beverage (cocoa and placebo) is prepared by [CONTACT_707876] a packet into water.  Participants will be asked to drink three beverages per day.   3.[ADDRESS_961849] PAD. PAD will be defined as follows:  1. An ABI < 0.90 at baseline is an inclusion criterion for PAD. ABI < 0.[ADDRESS_961850] for defining PAD (55-58).  2. Potential participants with an ABI > 0.[ADDRESS_961851] vascular lab evidence of PAD or angiographic evidence of PAD will be eligible.  Exclusion Criteria.   1. Above- or below-knee amputation. 2. Critical limb ischemia. 3. Wheelchair-bound or requiring a cane or walker to ambulate.  4. Walking is limited by a symptom other than PAD. 5. Baseline six-minute walk value of < 500 feet or > 1,600 feet. 6. Lower extremity revascularization, major orthopedic surgery, cardiovascular event, or coronary revascularization in the previous three months. 7. Planned revascularization or major surgery during the next six months.  8. Major medical illness including renal disease requiring dialysis, lung disease requiring oxygen, Parkinson’s disease, a life-threatening 
 Page 10 of 41  illness with life expectancy less than six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. [NOTE: potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an early stage cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent. Participants who require oxygen only at night may still qualify.]  9. Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score < [ADDRESS_961852] (i.e. unstable angina).  16. Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months. [NOTE: after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will become eligible after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or gene therapy study so long as at least six months have passed since the final intervention administration. After completing a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem cell or gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final study follow-up visit as long as at least three months have passed since the final intervention of the trial.]  17. Non-English speaking, a visual impairment that limits walking ability.  18. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.     Additional exclusion criteria for the muscle biopsy portion of the study: Participants who are taking anti-platelet therapy due to any history of TIA, stroke, or coronary stent or due to an acute coronary event in 
 Page [ADDRESS_961853]. Sufit and the patient agree to carry out the muscle biopsy while the participant remains on anti-platelet therapy. 3.3 Special Populations.  Vulnerable populations (fetuses, pregnant women, children, prisoners, and institutionalized persons) and adults unable to consent will not be included in this study.  4.0 Study-Wide Number of Subjects NA  5.0 Study-Wide Recruitment Methods NA  6.0 Multi-Site Research NA  7.0 Study Timelines Each participant’s part in this study will last approximately six months. We plan to enroll 44 eligible participants over 10 months. The estimated date to complete primary analyses is three years from the study start date.  8.0 Study Endpoints The primary study endpoint is the six-month change in the six-minute walk data. Secondary study endpoints include a) six-month change in maximal and pain-free treadmill walking time; b)six-month change in brachial artery FMD; c) six-month change in accelerometer-measured physical activity; and d) six month change in the following calf skeletal muscle measures: activity of Cytochrome C Oxidase (COX) and citrate synthase, calf muscle levels of peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), capi[INVESTIGATOR_95168], myostatin, follistatin, and mitochondrial transcription factor-alpha (TFAM) Data will be collected at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up visit. 9.[ADDRESS_961854] their name, address, telephone number(s), e-mail address, date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity.  In addition, some participants may be asked questions about their interest in supervised treadmill exercise programs, barriers to their participation in supervised exercise programs, and their ability to participate in supervised treadmill exercise programs.  These additional questions will be collected as pi[INVESTIGATOR_49452] a subsequent study and may be administered at any time point during the COCOA-PAD trial.  Baseline testing. Participants will be asked to come to Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707846].  In addition, at the baseline study visits, we will obtain the ankle brachial index (ABI) measurement, to ensure they are eligible for the study.  We will administer study questionnaires to obtain information about medical history, including presence of comorbidities, medication use, smoking status, and other health characteristics. We will perform baseline physical functioning tests including the six-minute walk test, chair stands, balance testing, and the treadmill walking performance test.  We will take a blood sample, measure participants’ height and weight, and measure the blood pressure in their arm. We will perform a test of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Physical activity levels will be measured using an accelerometer. In addition, participants will be asked to undergo an MRI and a calf muscle biopsy at baseline. However, potential participants not eligible for MRI testing will still be allowed to participate.  Participation in the calf muscle biopsy is optional.  Baseline study visits will be performed over multiple days. Participants who have a muscle biopsy will be telephoned at approximately seven days after the muscle biopsy.  Participants who report any complaints about their biopsy site (such as significant pain or redness) will be scheduled for an evaluation of their biopsy site by a study physician.   Details of baseline visit procedures are described in section 9.2.  Randomization.  Participants will be randomized to either epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa intervention or placebo using a SAS computer program. We will use block randomization with block sizes randomly selected from [ADDRESS_961855] access to a scale will be provided with a scale. They will be asked to bring this weight chart to each monthly visit.  Participants observed to gain five percent or more of their body weight compared to baseline during the study will be evaluated by [CONTACT_707877].  If the weight gain is determined due to increased caloric intake (rather than fluid weight gain), they will receive dietary counseling in effort to avoid additional weight gain and to advise them on dietary methods to help with weight control. Study beverages will be reduced or discontinued if a participant gains [ADDRESS_961856] will be measured while off of the study beverages for 48 hours.The calf muscle biopsy will be performed  after other outcome measures are complete and while on study beverages whenever possible.  If extenuating circumstances prevent outcome measurement in these defined time frames, the measurement will be obtained as close as possible to the desired time point/length of time after the final cocoa dose.  Some or all study measures may be repeated at baseline or follow-up for data quality (e.g. if a treadmill test must be stopped due to extremely high blood pressure before the patient completed the test is one potential example of why a measure may need to be repeated).   
 Page 14 of 41  In some cases, participants may be asked to take study beverages for longer than six months. For example, if a participant has an illness that prevents them from returning at six months for follow-up testing or if they are out of town during their six-month follow-up window.  In these instances, participants will be asked to continue taking their study beverages for more than six months. Participants may be asked to take up an additional two months of study beverages. 9.2 Research procedures. Ankle Brachial Index (ABI).  After the participant rests supi[INVESTIGATOR_140476], the right brachial, dorsalis pedis (DP), posterior tibial (PT) and left DP, PT, and brachial artery pressures are measured using a hand-held Doppler probe. Pressures are measured twice. The ABI is calculated for each leg by [CONTACT_707878] (59).  If a participant qualifies for a heel-rise ABI based on their initial ABI, they will be asked to perform [ADDRESS_961857] performed on the 100 foot course will be used for the study’s primary outcome measure.    Treadmill testing.  The Gardner graded treadmill exercise test is the standard, accepted treadmill protocol for measuring change in maximal treadmill walking time in response to interventions among PAD participants (34,60,61-63).  In the Gardner exercise protocol, speed is maintained at 2.0 miles per hour (mph) and treadmill grade increases by 2.0% every two minutes. If patients cannot walk at 2.0 mph, treadmill speed is started at 0.50 mph and increased by 0.50 mph every 2 minutes until the participant reaches 2.0 mph, after which the treadmill grade is increased every two minutes (34,60,61-63).  The treadmill stress test results will be read by [CONTACT_707879] [ADDRESS_961858] a high specificity for coronary artery disease.  Therefore, some participants will be allowed to continue in the COCOA-PAD Study.  This will be determined on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the electrocardiographic tracing is considered a ‘false positive’ based on a more specific stress test result or based on an angiogram result ordered separately by [CONTACT_2299]’s physician, then the participant will be allowed to continue in the study.  If the participant has stable angina or no angina symptoms and his/her physician considers a six-minute walk test safe, then the participant will be allowed to continue in the study, so long as he/she meets other eligibility criteria.  These are some examples of when it may be appropriate for a participant with an abnormal baseline exercise stress test to continue in the COCOA-PAD Study.    Brachial Artery FMD.  Brachial artery imaging will be performed by a Registered Diagnostic Cardiac Sonographer using established methods (34,51,64).  With the participant supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], a blood pressure cuff over the upper arm is inflated for five minutes at a supra-systolic pressure according to protocol. The brachial artery is imaged (B-mode and Doppler) 5 to 9 cm above the antecubital fossa using a linear array vascular ultrasound transducer (Siemens Medical Solutions). FMD is calculated as the percent change in brachial artery diameter [ADDRESS_961859]. James Stein’s laboratory by a reader blinded to participant group assignment.  Accelerometry.  Physical activity will be measured objectively and continuously in all participants over 7 days at baseline and follow-up, using the well-validated ActiGraph accelerometer (65-67).  Participants wear the ActiGraph on their beltline for seven days, removing it only for bathing or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  If the monitor needs to be worn following the biopsy, measurements will not begin until at least seven days have passed after the biopsy. By [CONTACT_159753], any discomfort from the muscle biopsy that may limit activity has resolved.    Blood collection and long-term storage. At baseline and six-month follow-up study visits, participants will have approximately 45 mls of blood drawn for processing and long-term storage at -70 degrees Celsius. Approximately 10% of participants selected by [CONTACT_707880], for a total of 90 mL at each visit. Blood obtained will be collected in serum, plasma EDTA, and plasma citrate tubes.  Stored blood will await later analyses for biomarkers and other emerging blood markers related to peripheral artery disease that may change in response to the intervention.  Genetic testing may also be performed on 
 Page 16 of 41  stored DNA if the participant agrees to this optional study element on the consent document. Results of the genetic testing on the sample will be stored with other data collected. Samples will be labeled with the participant’s study identification number and will not be stored with other health or identifying information. Information associated with the sample will be stored a secure database on password protected computers that are secured by [CONTACT_140503]. Access is limited to study staff. If the samples are shared with other researchers not part of the current study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_707847]. Samples will be identified with a study identification number and the other researchers will not have access to PHI. Results of testing on the blood samples will not be shared with the study participants.  Calf muscle biopsies.  Biopsies will be performed by [CONTACT_707881], MD, a board-certified neurologist with > [ADDRESS_961860] ABI, at the point that is 67% of the distance between the medial malleolus and the medial aspect of the proximal tibia.  This site represents greatest calf muscle diameter in >95% of individuals (68).  Anesthesia is achieved with subcutaneous lidocaine.  Subcutaneous and adipose tissue are dissected.  Approximately [ADDRESS_961861]. Leeuwenburgh’s laboratory at the University of [LOCATION_012] and [CONTACT_140530]’s laboratory at University of Kentucky for analyses.  Enzyme activities will be measured in whole muscle homogenates using established methods (69).  COX activity will be determined spectrophotometrically at 30°C as the maximal rate of oxidation of fully reduced Cytochrome C, measured by [CONTACT_707882] 550 nm. (69).

Participants and their physicians will be asked not to change their medications during the study if possible.  Participants will be asked to bring all of their medications to baseline and follow-up visits and to monthly adherence visits.  We will systematically record names and doses of medications and inquire about medication changes at each of these visits.  If we find differences in the use of specific medications between study groups (such as statins or cilostazol), we will adjust for these differences.    Other measures.  Body mass index (BMI) will be assessed at baseline and follow-up by [CONTACT_140505]. Weight will also be measured at monthly adherence visits.

Safety will also be monitored by [CONTACT_74583].  However, as described above, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa is a food product derived from the theobroma cacao plant.  Thus we anticipate that adverse events will be very infrequent.    Minimizing risks related to muscle biopsy.  The muscle biopsy procedure will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Robert Sufit who has more than [ADDRESS_961866]. McDermott immediately if any signs of wound infection occur. In addition, participants with a muscle biopsy will be telephoned approximately seven days after the muscle biopsy and will be asked about their muscle biopsy site.  Participants who report significant discomfort or redness at the site of the muscle biopsy site during this telephone call will return for a site visit.    Many PAD participants take anti-platelet therapy to prevent cardiac and cerebrovascular events.  If potential participants are taking anti-platelet therapy, they will be asked to hold their anti-platelet therapy during the seven days leading up to the muscle biopsy procedure. Participants who are asked to hold their anti-platelet therapy during the week leading up to the muscle biopsy procedure may experience a heart attack or stroke related to the temporary discontinuation of the anti-platelet therapy.  Permission from the participant’s physician will be required before participants are asked to discontinue anti-platelet therapy. Participants who are taking warfarin or other anti-coagulant therapy will not be eligible for muscle biopsy.    Minimizing risk related to baseline and follow-up testing.  All study coordinators undergo baseline training and are certified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. McDermott before beginning data collection (See Appendix A for an example certification checklist).

 Page [ADDRESS_961869]. McDermott will obtain IRB approval prior to releasing any blood or muscle specimens for analysis, other than those tests specifically named in this application.  11.0 Data and Specimen Management 11.1 Data management. Data is recorded using preprogrammed instruments and an electronic case report form using secure, HIPAA-compliant REDCap database software on servers maintained by [CONTACT_140515]’s Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. We have substantial experience with REDCap.   11.2 Power Estimates/Calculations.    The COCOA-PAD Study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_707851].  Therefore, we calculated the sample size that allows us to identify an effect size estimate. Our power calculations anticipate a < 10% drop-out rate at 6-month follow-up, based on data from our completed GOALS and SILC randomized trials in PAD participants (34,60). For our primary aim, we will compare changes in six-minute walk performance at 6-month follow-up between the epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa group and the placebo group. Comparisons will be made for measures obtained both while off of the study beverages for 2.5 hours and while off of the study beverages for 24 hours, respectively,  in order to assess both acute and chronic effects of cocoa on six-minute walk.  A total of 40 participants completing the trial will provide a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) with a margin of error of 0.[ADDRESS_961870] deviation (SD) for the effect size in change of six-minute walk performance between the cocoa (n=20) and the placebo groups (n=20). Using the estimated SD from our SILC trial (34), the margin of error of 0.[ADDRESS_961871] defined clinically meaningful changes in the six-minute walk as 20 meters (small meaningful difference) and 50 meters (large meaningful difference) (73,74).   Similarly, 40 participants completing the trial provides a two-sided 95% CI with a margin of error of 0.[ADDRESS_961872] size in 6-month change of each secondary outcome between the cocoa and placebo groups.       Statistical Analyses.  Data will be analyzed according to each participant’s originally assigned group, irrespective of whether the participant adheres to his/her assigned group (i.e. intention to treat principle).  For our Primary Aim, we will use a t-distribution to obtain the 95% CI for the difference in changes in six-minute walk performance at 6-month follow-up between the 
 Page 22 of 41  cocoa and placebo groups.  Comparisons at six months will be made to measure both the acute effects (2.5 hours after drinking the study beverages) and the chronic effects (24 hours after drinking the study beverages).  The characteristics of participants in the intervention and control group will be compared using t or chi-square tests.  If there is indication of major imbalance, we will perform analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with change in six-minute walk distance as the response variable to evaluate differences between the two groups, adjusting for potentially imbalanced covariates.  If there is evidence that the normality assumption for the distribution of outcome measures is violated, we will either apply appropriate transformation to the original measures before conducting the aforementioned analyses or obtain a nonparametric estimate and 95% CI for the difference in median between the cocoa and placebo groups (74). These methods will also be used to analyze outcomes in our secondary specific aims.  11.[ADDRESS_961873] with a significance level of 0.10 will be used to in the statistical analyses. Correspondingly, the point estimator and one-sided 90% CIs will be obtained for the differences in all outcomes between the cocoa and the placebo groups. Since the trial is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_707852]-rich cocoa on change in walking ability and other outcomes in PAD patients, one-sided tests are justified. For the same reason, the decision on whether a larger independent confirmatory study is warranted to prove the hypothesized treatment effect of cocoa will be made based on all relevant evidence in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_707853], which include but are not restricted to the statistical significance. Steps to secure data to maintain confidentiality during storage, use, and transmission. First, all research assistants must complete training in protection of subject privacy and prevention of disclosure of identifying information.  Second, all data collection forms are maintained in a secure office space.  Third, our study databases are maintained in locked computer files or on secure hard-drives that are password protected; to which only authorized staff have access. Dr. McDermott or a study manager must provide permission for programmers and research assistants to access study databases.  Fourth, a study identification number will be assigned to each participant. This identification number will be used to label blood specimens, for example. In addition, most pages of our data collection forms will have only the study identification number listed (and not the participant's name, for example). 
 Page [ADDRESS_961874] a split sample of muscle tissue (i.e. two samples from the same participant) sent for analyses.  The second muscle sample is designated an arbitrary identification number to which the technician is blinded.  Thus, quality control is monitored continuously.  A 20% subset of collected MR images will be interpreted by [CONTACT_707888]. For the skeletal muscle measures, a 10% subset of participants will have an additional quality control muscle specimen analyzed.  To achieve this, up to 40% of individuals may have up to [ADDRESS_961875] to follow-up.  However, in our prior randomized trials of PAD participants, drop-out rates were <10% at 6-month follow-up (34,60,75).  Thus, drop-out should be small.  Second, we recognize that not all participants may return for a second muscle biopsy at follow-up.  However, 95% of participants who completed a muscle biopsy in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_707854] a second biopsy.  Thus, loss to follow-up should be small. Third, some participants may not adhere to their beverage. We will measure adherence and will perform a sensitivity analysis that includes only those who adhered to 80% or more of their assigned beverage.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_707855] a larger trial.  12.[ADDRESS_961876] (DSMB) will monitor safety throughout the study.  Please see separate Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) charter.

The biostatisticians and data manager will work with the DSMB to perform interim analyses.  Adverse events will be monitored continuously 
 Page [ADDRESS_961877] four categories of adverse events will be defined:  a) death; b) cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary arrhythmias); c) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; and d) injury or illness causing chronic disability.  We will report all serious adverse events to the DSMB in a timely fashion.  In addition to these serious adverse events, we will monitor participant weight and blood pressure during monthly visits throughout the study.  We will use a designated data collection form to record these events.  As noted above, however, we anticipate that that epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa beverage will have few significant adverse events. 13.[ADDRESS_961878] a high prevalence of comorbid diseases, particularly coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and pulmonary disease.

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_707856] a major ingredient of cocoa that has therapeutic effects on skeletal muscle and the vasculature (21-30).  Our cocoa-beverage intervention is a food product, manufactured by [CONTACT_707889]. Similar cocoa drinks are widely available for commercial use.  The flavanol epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], when administered in therapeutic doses for research purposes, can cause lowering of blood pressure (76).  Thus, blood pressure levels will be measured monthly during the study.  The epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]-rich cocoa drink and the placebo will each deliver approximately 180 calories per day in the doses prescribed (three drinks per day).  Weight will be monitored monthly throughout study participation.   Risks associated with the muscle biopsy.  The muscle biopsy is associated with several potential risks.  These include discomfort during the muscle biopsy procedure and immediately afterward, scarring from the muscle biopsy skin incision, bleeding, and infection. In addition, potential participants who are asked to hold their anti-platelet therapy during the week leading up to the muscle biopsy procedure may experience a cardiovascular event related to the temporary discontinuation of the anti-platelet therapy.  First, to minimize risk related to muscle biopsy, all participants undergoing muscle biopsy will receive a written hand-out regarding signs to watch for that may indicate wound infection.  They will also be verbally instructed in this.  Each participant will be instructed to call Dr. McDermott immediately if any signs of infection occur. Participants will be telephoned approximately seven days after the muscle biopsy and asked for any symptoms that may suggest an infection or delayed healing.  Second, permission from the participant’s physician will be required before participants are asked to discontinue anti-platelet therapy.

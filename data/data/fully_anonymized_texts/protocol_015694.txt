Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 4  Page 10 of 69 30 October 2023 CONFIDENTIAL 1. STUDY SYNOPSIS Study Title: A Phase II Study of AB-16B5 combined with Docetaxel in Previously Treated Subjects with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer – EGIA-002 Study Abbreviated Title: AB-16B5 combined with Docetaxel in NSCLC Study Number: AB-16B5-201  Study Phase: II Study Period: 2020-2021 Study Design: This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center Phase II trial of AB-16B5 in combination with docetaxel in previously treated subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have experienced disease progression following treatment with a platinum-containing doublet treatment and an anti-PD1 or PD-L1 immune checkpoint antibody, administered simultaneously or sequentially. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in this trial and receive AB-16B5 at a dose of 12 mg/kg once weekly on Days 1, 8 and 15 combined with docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 once every [ADDRESS_1236904] of 21 days (3 weeks). The safety profile of the AB-16B5 and docetaxel combination will be examined during a safety lead-in period with the first 8 subjects completing one cycle of treatment or experiencing a DLT during Cycle 1 and being part of the DLT Evaluable population (as defined in Section 12.4.4). No dose escalation will be performed but a decision to de-escalate the AB-16B5 dose could be made using the modified toxicity probability interval method.  Radiographic imaging will be performed every 6 weeks until disease progression to assess response to treatment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria for determination of the objective response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS). Paired tumor biopsies (pre-treatment and on-treatment) will be collected in all subjects. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study and graded for severity according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Study treatment will continue until there is evidence of disease progression (defined according to RECIST 1.1), treatment-related adverse events of unacceptable severity, subject request for discontinuation or Investigator determination that further treatment is not in the subject’s best interest. Treatment through progression will be allowed if the Investigator considers the subject to be clinically stable (see Section 7.2 for definition of clinically stable).  Subjects who must discontinue AB-16B5 or docetaxel due to toxicity or any reasons other than progressive disease will continue the other treatment (AB-16B5 or docetaxel). Subjects who must discontinue both AB-16B5 and docetaxel for reasons other than progressive disease will remain in the study to obtain tumor imaging until disease progression. A futility analysis will also be conducted with a minimum of 10 evaluable subjects (i.e., subjects who are part of the Clinical Activity Evaluable Population as defined in Section 12.4.1). 
ALETHIA BIOTHERAPEUTICS  AB-16B5-201  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 4  Page 11 of 69 30 October 2023 CONFIDENTIAL Monitoring of responses will be done every 8 subjects thereafter until up to 34 evaluable subjects are obtained or the trial is stopped for futility. The trial will be stopped for futility if either 0 confirmed response out of 10 subjects, 1 confirmed response out of 18, 2 confirmed responses out of 26 or 6 confirmed responses out of 34 are obtained. If more than 6 confirmed responses are obtained out of 34 evaluable subjects, AB-16B5 in combination with docetaxel will be considered promising. Objectives: Primary Objectives:  • To determine the objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 in subjects receiving the combination of AB-16B5 and docetaxel • To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of AB-16B5 and docetaxel Secondary Objectives: • To determine the clinical benefit rate (complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)) per RECIST 1.1 and the duration of clinical benefit in subjects receiving the combination of AB-16B5 and docetaxel • To determine the duration of response (CR and PR) per RECIST 1.1 in subjects receiving the combination of AB-16B5 and docetaxel • To determine the duration of stable disease per RECIST 1.1 in subjects receiving the combination of AB-16B5 and docetaxel • To determine the progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 in subjects receiving the combination of AB-16B5 and docetaxel • To determine the overall survival (OS) in subjects receiving the combination of AB-16B5 and docetaxel • To determine the pharmacokinetics of AB-16B5 in this subject population

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 4  Page 16 of 69 30 October 2023 CONFIDENTIAL Statistical Methodology: This is a single arm Phase II study with a safety lead-in period and a futility analysis. To assess efficacy, the primary endpoint ORR will use a Predictive Probability Design ([COMPANY_003])1. The [COMPANY_003] is a flexible design that allows for the possibility to stop before the end of the trial if the treatment is not efficacious enough (futility).            Safety Lead-in Period The assumptions to be applied in establishing the mTPI2 methodology are: • the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined to have 0.30 probability of toxicity; and • the acceptable variance around the MTD is ± 0.05 (i.e., the region of the MTD is 25% to 35% incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT)). The mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_884196]-in before the dose de-escalation decision is made. No dose escalation will be allowed. The number of subjects with DLTs observed relative to the number of subjects treated at a specific dose determines whether dose de-escalation is needed. The treatment will be considered acceptable if no more than [ADDRESS_1236918] 8 subjects treated and being part of the DLT Evaluable population. De-escalation to AB-16B5 9 
ALETHIA BIOTHERAPEUTICS  AB-16B5-201  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 4  Page 17 of 69 30 October 2023 CONFIDENTIAL mg/kg will be performed if more than [ADDRESS_1236919] cycle in these 3 subjects, the AB-16B5 9 mg/kg dose will be considered acceptable. A final de-escalation of AB-16B5 to 6 mg/kg will be performed if more than [ADDRESS_1236920] experienced a DLT at 9 mg/kg and the safety profile will be evaluated using the same process as described above. For these purposes, a DLT will be defined as a ≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity occurring during Cycle 1 of therapy. In addition, the following hematologic toxicities will be considered as a DLT: • Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia > 7 days • Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding • Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia Toxicities that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to disease progression or to extraneous causes will not be considered DLTs. In addition, the following non-hematologic toxicities will not be considered DLTs: • Grade 3 arthralgia or myalgia which returns to Grade ≤ 1 within < 7 days with appropriate supportive care • Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea which returns to Grade ≤ 1 within < 72 hours with appropriate supportive care • Grade 3 fatigue lasting < 7 days • Grade [ADDRESS_1236921] less than 72 hours and are not associated with clinical symptoms • Grade 3 amylase or lipase elevation which is not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis Statistical Analyses The primary endpoint of ORR will be tested using [COMPANY_003]. Descriptive statistics including the number of evaluable subjects, the percentage of subjects, and the 95% confidence interval will be presented for ORR and clinical benefit rate. Duration of response, duration of stable disease, duration of clinical benefit, PFS and OS will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method to account for censoring data. Pharmacokinetic Analyses Noncompartmental analysis (NCA) of pharmacokinetic data will be conducted using standard approaches which will be defined in a separate analysis plan. If feasible, the peak concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration time curve (AUC), clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vz) and half-life will be reported.  Summary statistics will be provided. The pharmacokinetic data may also be evaluated using a population pharmacokinetics approach.

Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in this trial and receive AB-16B5 at a dose of 12 mg/kg once weekly on Days 1, 8 and 15 combined with docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 once every [ADDRESS_1236923] of 21 days (3 weeks). The safety profile of the AB-16B5 and docetaxel combination will be examined during a safety lead-in period with the first 8 subjects completing one cycle of treatment or experiencing a DLT during Cycle 1 and being part of the DLT Evaluable population (as defined in Section 12.4.4).  Radiographic imaging will be performed every 6 weeks until disease progression to assess response to treatment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria for determination of the objective response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS). A futility analysis will be conducted to minimize subject exposure to an ineffective treatment. Paired tumor biopsies (pre-treatment and on-treatment) will be collected in all subjects. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study and graded for severity according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Study treatment will continue until there is evidence of disease progression (defined according to RECIST 1.1), treatment-related adverse events of unacceptable severity, subject request for discontinuation or Investigator determination that further treatment is not in the subject’s best interest. Treatment beyond progression will be allowed if the Investigator considers the subject to be clinically stable (see Section 7.2 for definition of clinically stable).  Subjects who must discontinue AB-16B5 or docetaxel due to toxicity or any reasons other than progressive disease will continue on the other treatment (AB-16B5 or docetaxel). Subjects who must discontinue both AB-16B5 and docetaxel for reasons other than progressive disease will remain in the study to obtain tumor imaging until disease progression. 5.1 SAFETY LEAD-IN PERIOD The safety profile of AB-16B5 at a dose of 12 mg/kg administered once weekly on Days 1, 8 and 15 combined with docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 once every [ADDRESS_1236924] 8 subjects completing one cycle of treatment or experiencing a DLT during Cycle 1 and being part of the DLT Evaluable population. No dose escalation will be performed but a decision to de-escalate the dose of AB-16B5 could be made using the modified toxicity probability interval method (mTPI)2. The study treatment will be considered acceptable if no more than [ADDRESS_1236925] 8 subjects treated.  For these purposes, a DLT will be defined as a Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity occurring during Cycle 1 of therapy. In addition, the following hematologic toxicities will be considered as a DLT: • Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia > 7 days • Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding

In addition, the following non-hematologic toxicities will not be considered DLTs: • Grade 3 arthralgia or myalgia which returns to Grade ≤ 1 within < 7 days with appropriate supportive care • Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea which returns to Grade ≤ 1 within < 72 hours with appropriate supportive care • Grade 3 fatigue lasting < 7 days • Grade [ADDRESS_1236926] less than 72 hours and are not associated with clinical symptoms • Grade [ADDRESS_1236927] 8 subjects treated.  The next three subjects will then be treated with AB-16B5 at 9 mg/kg AB-16B5 administered once weekly on Days 1, 8 and 15 combined with docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 once every [ADDRESS_1236928] cycle in these 3 subjects, AB-16B5 at the 9 mg/kg dose will be considered acceptable.  If more than [ADDRESS_1236929] experienced a DLT, a final de-escalation of AB-16B5 to 6 mg/kg will be performed and the safety profile will be evaluated using the same process as described above. 5.2 FUTILITY ANALYSIS A futility analysis will also be conducted with a minimum of 10 evaluable subjects (i.e., subjects who are part of the Clinical Activity Evaluable Population as defined in Section 12.4.1). Monitoring of responses will be done every 8 subjects thereafter until up to 34 evaluable subjects are obtained or the trial is stopped for futility. The trial will be stopped for futility if either 0 confirmed response out of 10 subjects, 1 confirmed response out of 18, 2 confirmed responses out of 26 or 6 confirmed responses out of 34 are obtained. If more than 6 confirmed responses are obtained out of 34 evaluable subjects, AB-16B5 in combination with docetaxel will be considered promising.   Futility will be assessed once the number of evaluable patients is obtained at each review of the data. If the confirmation of a response is crucial for the decision making (e.g., if there is only one unconfirmed response out of the [ADDRESS_1236930] evaluable patients), the decision to stop for futility will be postponed until there is a second scan for confirmation.

A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_884200], for routine or planned clinical procedures, or for “social” reasons (not the result of any adverse change in the subject’s condition) should not be considered an adverse event and should not be reported as a serious adverse event. If the subject experiences any adverse change in condition during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the condition must be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event according to the above definitions.  +Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221121].  Unexpected Adverse Event: An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g. Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved study agent or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). Expected means that the event has previously been observed with the study treatment and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information. It does not mean that the event is expected with the underlying disease(s) or concomitant medications. 11.2 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS TO THE SPONSOR All adverse events that are identified from the start of study treatment administration (Day 1) through [ADDRESS_1236969] dose of study treatment will be recorded on the Adverse Event Electronic Case Report Form (AE eCRF). All data fields on the AE eCRF must be completed.  Serious Adverse Events must also be recorded on the SAE Worksheet and sent to the Drug Safety designee within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of the SAE. The SAE Worksheet should be completed as much as possible but should not be held until all information is available.  Additional information, follow-up information, and corrections should be provided on subsequent updates of the SAE Worksheet that are clearly identified as follow-up (#1, #2, etc.) reports. The SAE Worksheets should be sent to the Sponsor using the Drug Safety contact [CONTACT_884208].

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 4  Page 57 of 69 30 October 2023 CONFIDENTIAL Grade Severity Description 5 Death Death related to AE. *Note – a severity assessment of life-threatening is not necessarily the same as the seriousness criterion of life-threatening. The former means that the event is a potential threat to life. The latter means that the event is an immediate threat to life. Causality: For each AE, the Investigator should determine and document whether there exists a reasonable possibility that any component of the study treatment caused or contributed to the AE. The Investigator’s assessment should be recorded in the source document. If the Investigator does not know whether or not the study treatment is causally related to the event, reporting for study purposes will be as at least “possibly related” to study treatment. The initial causality assessment may be revised as new information becomes available (see table below). Relationship to Drug  Description  Definitely Related  Exhibits previously known toxicity of agent; or  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug;  Follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug;  Is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and  Is not explained by [CONTACT_41846]. Probably Related Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study drug administration; and/or  Follows a known response pattern to the study drug. Possibly Related  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study drug administration; and/or  Follows a known response pattern to the study drug; but could have been produced by [CONTACT_244130]’s clinical state, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy. Unlikely Related  Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study drug administration; and  Was likely produced by [CONTACT_244130]’s clinical state, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy, but for which relationship cannot be definitely ruled out. Not related The adverse event can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study drug. 11.[ADDRESS_1236972] not resolved by [CONTACT_884209]-up period will be recorded as ongoing. However, subjects with a related AE of Grade ³ 2 will be further followed (during Survival Follow-Up) until the resolution of the AE to Grade £ [ADDRESS_1236973] not resolved by [CONTACT_884209]-up period are followed until final outcome is known. If it is not possible to obtain a final outcome for a SAE (e.g., the subject is lost to follow up), the reason that a final outcome could not be obtained will be documented by [CONTACT_737].

In addition, the Sponsor or designee follows all applicable local and national regulatory requirements regarding safety reporting. Each Investigator must also comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) responsible for reviewing the study at their site, as well as the regulatory authority(ies) (if applicable). 12. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Final statistical analyses (excluding interim analyses) will be performed once that last enrolled subject has completed [ADDRESS_1236976], and that the database has been locked.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 4  Page 59 of 69 30 October 2023 CONFIDENTIAL   12.2 SAFETY LEAD-IN PERIOD The assumptions to be applied in establishing the mTPI2 methodology are: • the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined to have 0.30 probability of toxicity; and • the acceptable variance around the MTD is ± 0.05 (i.e., the region of the MTD is 25% to 35% incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT)). The mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_884196]-in before the dose de-escalation decision is made. No dose escalation will be allowed. The number of subjects with DLTs observed relative to the number of subjects treated at a specific dose determines whether dose de-escalation is needed. The treatment will be considered acceptable if no more than [ADDRESS_1236977] 8 subjects treated and being part of the DLT Evaluable population. De-escalation to AB-16B5 9 mg/kg dose will be performed if more than [ADDRESS_1236978] cycle in these 3 subjects, the AB-16B5 9 mg/kg dose will be considered acceptable. A final de-escalation of AB-16B5 to 6 mg/kg will be performed if more than [ADDRESS_1236979] experienced a DLT at 9 mg/kg and the safety profile will be evaluated using the same process as described above.  For these purposes, a DLT will be defined as a Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity occurring during Cycle 1 of therapy. In addition, the following hematologic toxicities will be considered as a DLT: • Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia > 7 days • Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding • Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia Toxicities that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to disease progression or to extraneous causes will not be considered DLTs. In addition, the following non-hematologic toxicities will not be considered DLTs: • Grade 3 arthralgia or myalgia which returns to Grade ≤ 1 within < 7 days with appropriate supportive care • Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea which returns to Grade ≤ 1 within < 72 hours with appropriate supportive care • Grade 3 fatigue lasting < 7 days • Grade [ADDRESS_1236980] less than 72 hours and are not associated with clinical symptoms

Data summaries will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate. Detailed analyses will be described in the SAP. For all variables, only the observed data from subjects will be used in the statistical analyses; there is no plan to estimate missing data. Subjects without a valid clinical response assessment will be assigned a best overall response of not evaluable (NE). Data from subjects who are lost to follow-up or have missing observations before reaching an endpoint in any of the time-to-event analyses will be treated as censored with specific rules defined in the SAP. 12.[ADDRESS_1236982] one dose of each study treatment drug (AB-16B5 and Docetaxel) and have at least one on-study disease assessment (post-dose) or develop early progression and discontinue study treatment prior to the first planned on-study disease assessment. Subjects who discontinue both study treatment drugs due to any other reason prior to their on-study disease assessment will not be included in the Clinical Activity Evaluable population.  This population will be used to evaluate futility rules as per [COMPANY_003], to present tumor responses data and summary statistics. 12.4.2 mITT Population The modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) population will include subjects who receive at least one dose of each study treatment (AB-16B5 and Docetaxel).  This population will be used to present PFS and OS. 12.4.[ADDRESS_1236983] one dose of any study treatment drug (i.e., AB-16B5 or Docetaxel). The Safety population will be used for all safety analyses. 12.4.4 DLT Evaluable Population  The DLT Evaluable population is defined as all subjects enrolled in the safety lead-in period who experienced a DLT during Cycle 1 or who completed one cycle of treatment (all 3 complete doses of AB-16B5 and 1 complete dose of Docetaxel). Subjects who are not evaluable for DLT will be

Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percent of subjects documented to have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).  The primary endpoint of ORR will be tested using [COMPANY_003]. Descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, and 95% CI) for ORR and best overall response (CR, PR, SD, PD, NE) will be presented.  12.5.2 Clinical Benefit Rate Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the percentage of subjects documented to have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) documented during at least [ADDRESS_1236986] 10 weeks on study (i.e., allowance for 2-week window around Week 12 assessment).  Descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, and 95% CI) for CBR will be presented.  12.5.3 Duration of Response Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from date of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) or to death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD. DOR will only be calculated for the subgroup of subjects achieving a confirmed CR or PR. The Kaplan Meier method will be used to estimate median DOR. Subjects with objective tumor response, and alive without PD at the end of the study will be censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Other rules and time points for censoring for DOR will be specified in SAP.

Subjects with stable disease, and alive without PD at the end of the study will be censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Other rules and time points for censoring for duration of stable disease will be specified in SAP. 12.5.6 Progression-Free Survival Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of first study treatment to first PD or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD. Censoring for the PFS endpoint will be assigned on the date of the last tumor assessment if no assessment of tumor progression is identified and the subject does not die while on study. For subjects in whom two or more sequential assessments are missed, followed by [CONTACT_297008], the PFS endpoint will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment before the gap. Subjects lacking an evaluation of disease after first study treatment will have their PFS time censored on the date of first dose with duration of [ADDRESS_1236989] tumor assessment prior to the start of the new therapy. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to obtain the estimate of median progression-free survival time.  12.5.7 Overall Survival Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of first study treatment to death due to any cause. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the median OS and 1-year Survival Rate. The 95% CI of the 1-year survival rate will also be reported. Censoring for the survival endpoint will be assigned on the date of the last on study follow-up that the subject is reported to be alive.

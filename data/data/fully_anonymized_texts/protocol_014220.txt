A Multi-Center, Randomized, Double Blind, Ph ase III Trial Evaluating Corticosteroids 
with Mycophenolate Mofetil vs. Corticostero ids with Placebo as Initial Systemic  
Treatment of Acute GVHD 
 
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_110827]ños Meade, MD 
Co-Principal Investigator: [CONTACT_85006] T. Ho, MD 
 Study Design:  The study is a Phase III, ra ndomized double blind, placebo 
controlled trial evaluating the addition of MMF vs. placebo to 
systemic corticosteroids as initial therapy for acute GVHD.  The primary endpoint will be GVHD free survival at Day [ADDRESS_123451] been used  as primary therapy for acute 
GVHD for many years.  Historical  published and unpublished data 
from Johns Hopkins, M. D. Anderson, University of Michigan and others defined an expected 35%- 53% complete response (CR) at 
Day +[ADDRESS_123452] rates of 
CR at Day 28 and overall survival, supporting its evaluation in a Phase III study.  Day 56 GVHD-free survival for the four treatment arms (all combining corticosteroids with one of the four study drugs) ranged from 39-71% across the four study arms. 
 In this trial, patients with  newly diagnosed acute GVHD will 
receive corticosteroids and will be randomized to also receive 
either placebo or mycophenolat e mofetil.  Each arm will be 
assessed for safety (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_110828]) and efficacy. 
 Primary Objective:  The primary objective is to estimate graft-versus-host disease free 
survival (acute or chronic) at  Day 56 after randomization without 
additional therapy. 
 Secondary Objectives:  Secondary objectives include: 
1. Proportions of complete, partia l (PR), mixed response, no 
response and progression among su rviving patients at Day 14, 
28 and 56.  
2. Treatment failure (treatment fa ilure defined as: no response, 
progression, administration of a dditional therapy for GVHD, or 
mortality) at Day 14, 28, and 56.

Version 3.0 dated January 31, 2011 
 
 
iii 3. The incidence of acute GVHD flare after CR/PR requiring 
additional agent (including 2.5 mg /kg/day of prednisone [or 
methylprednisolone e quivalent of 2 mg/kg/ day]) for systemic 
therapy before Day [ADDRESS_123453]-randomization.   
4. Incidence of discontinuation of immune suppression without 
acute GVHD flare and without di sease progression/recurrence 
by [CONTACT_52996] 56, 180, and [ADDRESS_123454]-randomization. 
6. Incidence of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/non-absorb able therapy given by [CONTACT_2006] 56. 
7. Incidence of chronic GVHD by [ADDRESS_123455] randomization. 
12. Non-relapse mortality at 6 and 12 months. 
13. Change in patient-reported outcomes from enrollment to Day 
56. 
 Eligibility:  Patients must have acute GVHD (grade I-IV) requiring systemic 
therapy.  No previous systemic immune suppressive therapy for 
acute GVHD is allowed except for a maximum [ADDRESS_123456] an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 500/ μL.  Patients with acute 
GVHD after salvage donor lymphocytes are not eligible (preplanned DLI is allowed).  
 Treatment Description:  All patients will receive prednisone 2 mg/kg/day PO (or 
methylprednisolone at 1.6mg/kg/ day IV) divided in 1-2 daily 
doses.  Prednisone may be tape red as tolerated according to 
institutional practice.  However, prednisone taper may not start 
sooner than 3 days after randomi zation, and the prednisone dose 
can not be less than 0.25 mg/kg/day prednisone (methylprednisolone 0.2 mg /kg/day) at Day [ADDRESS_123457]-
randomization.   
 Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either 
placebo or mycophenolate mofetil 1 gm  PO or IV every 8 hours.  
Study drug (MMF/Placebo) should be  discontinued by [CONTACT_2006] 56, or 
when prednisone taper is comp lete, whichever occurs first.  
 Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_110829] (e.g. 
calcineurin inhibitor, sirolimus, etc.) should have their prophylaxis

Version 3.0 dated January 31, 2011 
 
 
iv medication continued during th e study period if possible.  
Concurrent or addition of topi[INVESTIGATOR_110830] (skin creams, oral 
beclomethasone, and other non-abso rbable steroids) is allowed. 
 In addition to prescribed study drug plus corticosteroids, all 
patients should receive transf usion support per institutional 
practice; anti-infective prophylax is against herpes viruses, 
Pneumocystis jiroveci, bacterial and fungal infections should be 
followed according to institutional practices.  Pre-emptive monitoring and treatment st rategy for CMV is strongly 
recommended. 
 GVHD organ stage scores, overall clinical grade, biopsy 
information for GVHD, GVHD medi cations, presence of chronic 
GVHD, and steroid dose will be recorded weekly and reported to the BMT CTN Data Coor dinating Center (DCC). 
 Accrual Objective:  [ADDRESS_123458] udy arm (a total of 372 patients). 
 Accrual Period:  The estimated accrual period is 3 years. 
 Study Duration: Patients will be followed for 12 months following initiation  of 
therapy.

v STUDY SCHEMA 
 
Aim:  To determine if the addition of mycophenolate mofetil to corticosteroids as initial therapy for acute 
GVHD improves GVHD free survival and overall clinical outcome.  
 
Inclusion Criteria 
1. Acute GVHD diagnosed after allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant using either bone marrow, PBSC or cord blood.  
2. Acute GVHD developi[INVESTIGATOR_110831]-planned DLI is 
eligible. 
3. Grade I-IV acute GVHD requiring systemic 
therapy. 
4. Patients of all ages will be included. 
5. Biopsy confirmation of GVHD is recommended, 
but not required.  Enrollment should not be delayed awaiting biopsy or pathology results.   
6. The patient must have received no previous 
systemic immune suppressive therapy for treatment  of acute GVHD, except for a maximum 
72 hours of prior corticosteroid therapy  
7. Clinical status at enrollment to allow tapering of  
prednisone to not less than 0.25 mg/kg/day 
prednisone (0.2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone) at 
Day 28 of therapy  
8. ANC greater than 500/ μL. 
9. Signed informed consent and/or assent. 
10. Assent and educational materials provided to, and 
reviewed with, patients under the age of 18. Exclusion Criteria 
1. Mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid 
(Myfortic) given within 7 days of enrollment. 
2. Active uncontrolled infection. 
3. Relapsed/persistent malignancy requiring rapid 
immune suppression withdrawal. 
4. Patients that have undergone an unscheduled (or not 
part of original transplant therapy plan) DLI. 
5. Patients unlikely to be available at the transplant 
center on Day 28 and 56 of therapy. 
6. A clinical syndrome resembling de novo chronic 
GVHD developi[INVESTIGATOR_110832]. 
7. Other drugs for GVHD treatment 
8. If any prior steroid therapy (for indication other than 
GVHD), treatment at doses > 0.5 mg/kg/day methyl-prednisolone within [ADDRESS_123459] normalized bilirubin by 
[CONTACT_2006] 56. 
13. Patients with a history of intolerance/allergy to 
MMF.  
 
After 3 days of full dose corticosteroids + MMF/placebo : Taper steroids as tolerated according to institutional 
practices, but to no less than 0.25 mg/kg/day prednisone (or 0.2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone) on Day 28.  Steroid 
taper may not start sooner than 3 days after randomizatio n if GVHD is improving.  Improvement is defined as any 
clinically recognizable lessening of skin  rash, redness, or extent; lessening of diarrhea or lowered bilirubin (though it 
does not have to be greater than or equal to one stage improvement in any involved organ), without worsening in any organ.  
If acute GVHD progresses within 5 days or no response within 14 days, then treat with alternative systemic 
secondary GVHD therapy at the physician’s discretion.  This patient would be considered a failure for the primary 
endpoint.  This patient will be considered “off study tr eatment”, but will remain on study to be followed for study 
endpoints.    
If acute GVHD flares during taper of prednisone, steroid dosing may be re-escalated or secondary therapy 
added at the discretion of the treating physician.  Re-escalation of steroid for GVHD flare alone will not be 
considered as treatment failure.

BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Acute GVHD Treatment – Protocol [ADDRESS_123467] disease (GVHD) is the ma jor complication of all ogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell (HSC) transplantation.
[ADDRESS_123468].  It is belie ved that T-lymphocytes c ontained in the donor graft 
respond in vivo to disparate major (HLA) or  minor (non-HLA) histocompatibility antigens 
expressed by [CONTACT_110871][INVESTIGATOR_110833], initiating a cascade of events leading to the signs and symptoms of acute GVHD.
1   
 The syndrome of acute GVHD includes the followi ng signs and symptoms.  Skin involvement 
(maculopapular exanthem) is usually the first sign.  Lesions may be pruritic  or painful, red to 
violaceous in color, and often involve the palms  and soles. Acute GVHD of the gut may involve 
the stomach, small bowel and colon producing persistent na usea and vomiting or profuse 
diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_110834].  Liver GVHD produces 
cholestatic liver injury with  hyperbilirubinemia and, in some  cases, hepatocellular enzyme 
elevations.    The use of cyclosporine (CSA) or tacrolimus (FK) plus short course methotrexate (MTX) has lowered the risk for acute GVHD compared to si ngle agent or other combination therapy, but 
even with these regimens, 35-50% of  patients develop Grade 2-[ADDRESS_123469] served as the primary therapy for acute GVHD for over three decades. 
There is some variability among investigators and transplant center s regarding the optimal 
starting dose of corticosteroids,  particularly in early stage GVHD.  However, a recommended 
initial dose of corticosteroids for moderate to severe (Grade II-IV) acute GVHD accepted in most 
transplant centers is 2 mg/ kg/day of methylprednisolone, or an equivalent steroid.
1, 2, 3  T h e  
response rate to single-agent cortic osteroid therapy, when analyzed  in large retrospective reviews 
is approximately 50%.4, 5  Doses higher than 2 mg/kg/day have not been associated with 
improvement in response rates.6  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_95055],  many patients will experience a 
flare of their GVHD upon steroid taper, and th e durability of response is  often substantially 
lower.  In acute GVHD developi[INVESTIGATOR_110835] d unrelated and related donor transplantation, 
durable remission of acute GVHD with steroid al one were reported in only 24% and 40% of 
patients, respectively.7, 8

ATG as initial therapy of acute GVHD have reported response rates from 67% to 80%.

receptor alpha chain) antibody, daclizumab (1 mg /kg) on Days 1, 4 and weekly thereafter or 
placebo in conjunction with cortic osteroids.  While response ra tes were similar in both groups 
(53 vs. 51%), survival at 100 days and 1 year was inferior in the steroid + daclizumab group.
14  
A randomized study evaluating BT563 (an antibody ag ainst the IL-2 receptor) also did not 
demonstrate an advantage over placebo wh en combined with prednisone alone.[ADDRESS_123472] bo to methylprednisolone also yielded similar 
clinical results.16  Manifestations of acute GVHD responded more quickly in the 
immunoconjugate arm, but benefits were not durable.  Fina lly, Uberti et al reported a 75% 
response rate in 20 patients with biopsy prove n acute GVHD when etanercept, a recombinant 
TNF-alpha receptor fusion protein capable of ne utralizing TNF, was give n in conjunction with 
corticosteroids with tacrolimus.17  
 Recently, the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinic al Trials Network completed a multi-center 
randomized, four-arm, Phase II trial (BMT CTN 0302) designed to identify the most promising 
agent for combination with steroids as initial therapy for the treatment of GVHD.
[ADDRESS_123473] 2005 and March 2008, 180 patie nts with newly diagnosed GVHD were randomized to 
receive steroids (2 mg/kg/da y methylprednisolone) plus e ither etanercept, mycophenolate 
mofetil, denileukin diftitox or pentostatin.  The primary objective was to estimate the complete response rate at Day [ADDRESS_123474] steroids alone.  The 
median age of patients was 50 yrs (range, 7.5–69.9) with 96% > 18 yrs; 39% had AML and 63% 
were male.  The graft was peripheral blood (P B) in 61%, bone marrow (BM) in 25% and cord

1-3 blood (CB) in 14%.  Myeloablative conditioning was used for 66% of patients, and 53% of 
patients had unrelated donors.  Forty-four pa tients (24%) received mycophenolate mofetil as 
GVHD prophylaxis and were randomized to 1 of the 3 non-mycophenolate mofetil arms.  
 At enrollment, 68% of patients had grade I-II GVHD; 32% had grade III/IV GVHD.  Fifty-three 
percent of patients had visceral  organ involvement at the time of  enrollment.  The treatment arms

1-5 1.2.1.  Mycophenolate Mofetil/Placebo 
 Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a morpholinoet hyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA). A 
product of several penicillium species, MPA po ssesses antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, 
antitumor and immunosuppressive pr operties.  MMF is a pro-dr ug since the immunosuppressive 
activity is evident only after hydrolysis to MPA.  MMF was developed to enhance the 
bioavailability of MPA.  MPA mediates its  effect by [CONTACT_110872] (IMPDH), an enzyme that catalyz es the oxidation of inosine monophosphate to 
xanthine monophosphate, an interm ediate metabolite in the synt hesis of guanosine triphosphate 
(GTP).  Lymphocytes rely on the de novo purine s ynthesis pathway for the nucleotides necessary 
for DNA synthesis; other cells can also rely on  the salvage pathway.  The action of MPA results 
in the depletion of the nucleotide pool in cell s ynthesis.  An additional mode of action of MPA 
may be that, by [CONTACT_110873], it inhibits re cruitment of leukocytes to  sites of inflammation 
by [CONTACT_110874].  
 MMF in acute GVHD  Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an agent alre ady commonly used as GVHD prophylaxis, or 
treatment of steroid refractory GVHD after allogeneic SCT.  MMF suppresses T cell 
proliferation by [CONTACT_110875] e triphosphate.  Basara 
et al initially reported a 65% res ponse rate in [ADDRESS_123476], and this higher dos ing schedule has been to be well 
tolerated.  Pharmacokinetic studies from the an tecedent phase II trial (BMT CTN 0302), where 
the starting MMF dose was [ADDRESS_123477] furt her shown that an increase in MMF dosing to 
q8Hrs (TID) may be warranted, as described below.  Among the 180 subjects enrolled in the BMT CTN 0302 Acute GVHD Trial from November 2005 to March 2008, 45 subjects were randomized to MMF.  Blood samples for pharmacokinetic 
analyses of mycophenolic acid (MPA, the active metabolite of MMF) were available for [ADDRESS_123478] 2 weeks of treatment.  Although the sample size was small, PK data 
from these patients showed that following dosing at  1 gm BID, 45-59% of the trough levels were 
low (defined as MPA trough <0.5 mcg/mL, or free MPA troughs <15 ng/mL), while < 5% had levels that were considered high.  These results confirm that a sizeable fraction of patients likely 
had under-dosing of MMF on the 1gm BID schedul e.  Analysis of MPA levels with GVHD 
responses in this trial further demonstrated th at trough MPA concentrations affect efficacy.  
Although MPA within the first 2 weeks of treatment  did not appear to influence response at Day 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Acute GVHD Treatment – Protocol 0802 
Version 3.0 dated January 31, 2011 
 
 
1-6 28, MPA total (>0.5 mcg/mL) and free (>15 ng/mL) troughs were associated with higher CR/PR 
at Day 56.    Based in part upon these results, the starting dos e of MMF/placebo in the current proposed trial 
will be 1gm TID.  We believe that  this schedule will insure that  a greater proportion of patients 
will have therapeutically suitabl e drug exposure.  Treating physicia ns will be given discretion for 
reducing the MMF/Placebo dose from TID to BID base on potential toxic ities (Section 2.5), and 
the rates of sustained dose reductions on both arms will be monitored in interim analyses to assure patient safety (see monito ring plan, Section 4.25 and Chapter 5). 
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Acute GVHD Treatment – Protocol [ADDRESS_123479] udy arm will include cortic osteroids plus either 
mycophenolate mofetil or placebo.    
Accrual Objective:  [ADDRESS_123480] udy arm (a total of 372 patients).  
 
Accrual Period:  The estimated accrual period is 3 years. 
 Study Duration: Patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_123481] disease free survival (acute or chronic) at Day [ADDRESS_123482] 
toxic of the drugs tested (mycophenolate mofetil, etanercept, pentostatin and denileukin diftitox). 
 2.3. Eligibility 
 2.3.1.  Inclusion Criteria 
 Biopsy of involved tissue is strongly encourage d, but not required for study entry.  The clinical 
diagnosis of acute GVHD requiring systemic ther apy with corticostero ids is necessary for 
enrollment on the trial.  Enrollment and random ization includes commitment to continue both 
steroids and study drug as indicated by [CONTACT_110876]-up 
observations.  If the intention to treat a patient  depends on histologic results, the patient should 
not be enrolled on the BMT CTN [ADDRESS_123483] blood.  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16483]-
myeloablative and myeloablative transplants are eligible.   
2. Acute GVHD after planned donor lymphocyte infusion or planned T cell addback are 
eligible.

Version 3.0 dated January 31, 2011 
 
 
2-2  
3. De novo acute GVHD requiring systemic therap y. GVHD is defined as the presence of 
skin rash and/or persistent nausea, vomiting, a nd/or diarrhea and/or cholestasis presenting 
in a context in which acute GVHD is likely to  occur and where other etiologies such as 
drug rash, enteric infection, or hepatotoxic syndromes are unlikely or have been ruled 
out.  Note that patients with stage I and II  skin only (overall grade I) or isolated upper 
gastrointestinal (GI) involvement are elig ible if the treating physician deems that 
systemic high-dose corticostero id treatment is indicated. 
4. The patient must have had no previous systemic immune suppr essive therapy for 
treatment of acute GVHD except for a maximu m 72 hours of prior corticosteroid therapy 
at >0.5mg/kg/day methylpredni solone or equivalent after the onset of acute GVHD. 
5. Clinical status at enrollment to allow tapering of steroids to not less than 0.25 mg/kg/day 
prednisone (0.2 mg/kg/da y methylprednisolone) at  Day 28 of therapy. 
6. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 500/ μL. 
7. Written informed consent and/or assent from patient, parent or guardian. 
8. Documentation that the assent  document and education materi als have been provided to, 
and reviewed with, patients between the ages of 7 and 17. 
9. Patients of all ages are eligible.  
10. Biopsy confirmation of GVHD is  recommended, but not required.  Enrollment should not 
be delayed for biopsy or pat hology results unless these are to be used to decide about 
whether to treat for GVHD.  
 2.3.2.  Exclusion Criteria 
1. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil or my cophenolic acid (Myf ortic) within seven 
days of screening for enrollment. 
2. Patients with uncontrolled infections will be excluded.  If a bacterial or viral infection is 
present, patients must be receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for [ADDRESS_123484] 
be receiving definitive syste mic anti-fungal therapy and ha ve no signs of progressing 
infection for 1 week prior to enrollment. 
Progressing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis or new 
symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiogr aphic findings attributable to infection.  
Persisting fever without other signs or symp toms will not be inte rpreted as progressing 
infection. 
3. Relapsed/persistent maligna ncy requiring rapid immune  suppression withdrawal. 
4. Patients with GVHD after an unplanned DLI, i.e., DLI that was not part of their original 
transplant therapy plan, or DLI given for trea tment of persistent or recurrent malignancy 
after transplantation. 
5. Patients unlikely to be available at the transplantation center on Day 28 and 56 of 
therapy.

2-3 6. A clinical syndrome resembling de novo ch ronic GVHD developi[INVESTIGATOR_110836]. 
7. Patients receiving other drugs for the treatment of GVHD.   
8. Patients receiving methylprednisolone > 0.5 mg/kg/day (or 0.6 mg/kg/day prednisone) 
within 7 days before the onset of acute GVH D.  If steroid therapy has been administered 
for treatment of a non- *9+' UHODWHG FRQGLWLRQ DQG WD SHUHG WR   PJNJGD\
methylprednisolone (0.6 mg/kg/ day prednisone) for seven or more days before the onset 
of acute GVHD, the patient is eligible.  
9. Patients who are pregnant, breast feeding, or, if  sexually active, unwilling to use effective 
birth control for the duration of the study.  Av ailable evidence and/or expert consensus is 
inconclusive or is inadequate for determining infant risk when used during breastfeeding, 
therefore breast feeding patients are not eligible. 
10. Adults unable to provide informed consent. 
11. Patients on dialysis.   
12. Patients with severe hepa tic VOD or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome who in the 
judgment of the treating physician are not expe cted to have normalized bilirubin by [CONTACT_2006] 
56 after enrollment. 
13. Patients with a history of in tolerance/allergy to MMF. 
 2.3.3.  Informed Consent 
 The informed consent process will begin at recognition of subject eligibility and consent will be obtained per institutional practices before study therapy is initiated. 
 2.4. Treatment Plan 
 2.4.1.  Randomization 
 After registration and enrollment, the study partic ipant will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to 
receive either MMF or placebo as described in Chapter 5.  
 2.4.2.  Corticosteroid Dosing and Taper 
 All patients enrolled on this  trial will receive steroids at a dos e of prednisone 2mg/kg/day PO (or 
methylprednisolone 1.6 mg/kg/day IV) as therap y of acute GVHD.  Pediatric patients unable to 
take tablets can use oral pre dnisolone solution 2 mg/kg/day.  Steroid taper may follow local 
institutional practice.  However, for those improving, steroid taper may not start sooner than [ADDRESS_123485] not be tapered to  less than 0.25 mg/kg/day 
prednisone (or 0.2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone) on Day 28 .

0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone once daily Days 16-20  
0.25 mg/kg/day of prednisone once daily Days 21-28 
Patients should be tapered as tolerated to no less than 0.25 mg/kg/day (methylprednisolone 
0.2 mg/kg/day) by [CONTACT_2006] 28.  
Then taper according to institutional guidelines with a goal to reach < 0.2 mg/per/kg per 
day of prednisone or < 0.16 m g/per/kg per da y of meth ylprednisolone b y Day 56. 
 
2.4.3.  MMF/Placebo Formulation, Dosing, and Duration 
 Study treatment (MMF/placebo) shoul d be initiated as soon as possible after randomization.  A 
maximum of 48 hours is allowable.    Formulation and Drug Supply  MMF/Placebo will be obtained by [CONTACT_110877] N/EMMES, and distributed through an 
independent contractor.  Questions regardi ng study drug orders and study drug distribution 
should be directed to the tria l protocol coordinator at EMME S.  MMF/placebo will be provided 
by [CONTACT_110878] 8 weeks.  Oral MMF/placebo is available as 250 mg capsules in bottles of  70 each.  Capsules should be  stored at room temperature.   
 Intravenous: MMF/placebo for intravenous use w ill be supplied as a lyophilized powder.  The 
study drug will be reconstituted by [CONTACT_44579] 5% Dextrose in Water (D5W) into each vial. 
Intravenous MMF/placebo does not contain an antib acterial preservative; therefore, the study 
drug should be prepared under aseptic conditions.  Reconstitute each vial with 14 mL D5W.  
Gently shake vial to dissolve the drug.  Furthe r dilute into D5W for a final concentration of 
6 mg/mL.  Dilute 1-g doses in [ADDRESS_123486] at each ce nter should prepare each dose of drug to avoid errors.  Because of the 
potential teratogenic effects of MMF, pharmacists should follow institutional guidelines for the preparation of similar types of solutions.  At  the completion of the study, unused MMF/Placebo 
study drug should be returned to the study team by [CONTACT_110879].  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Acute GVHD Treatment – Protocol 0802 
Version 3.0 dated January 31, 2011 
 
 
2-5 The investigator (and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98341]) will ensure that all study drug is stored in a secured 
area under recommended storage conditions and is dispensed by [CONTACT_98390].  All 
study drug will be accounted for on medication inventory sheets. 
 The BMT CTN will be allowed at intervals, and upon request during the study, to check unused 
supplies.  Accounting for the use of supplies w ill be by [CONTACT_110880]'s record of 
supplies received, the dispensing records for the total number of patients enrolled at each center and the unused and returned supplies.  The investigator is responsible for maintaini ng drug accountability records.  Drug accountability 
records will be reviewed during monitoring visits.  Each institution may use their own drug accountability log.  Study drug must be administered onl y to patients enrolled in this study as per 
the protocol.  
 
Dose and Administration  For BMT CTN 0802, the dose of MMF will be different than the one used in 0302.  This is based on the pharmacologic analysis of patients receiving MMF enrolled on BMT CTN 0302.  This 
will insure a substantially greater proportion of patients will have therapeutically suitable drug exposure.  Oral dosing should be delivered in either 250 mg units or identical blinded placebo.   
For those < 40 kg, IV dosing should be within ± 10%  of the exact dose.  Intravenous doses are 
infused over a two-hour period.  The study drug capsule may not be opened to administer. 
x Patients who weigh > 60 kg should receive MMF 1 gm PO/IV every 8 hours. 
x Patients who weigh between 40-60 kg shoul d receive 750 mg PO/IV every 8 hours. 
x Patients who weigh <40 kg should receive 20 mg /kg IV or PO (up to 750 mg/kg) every 8 
hours. 
x Patients with  ANC < 1000 at the time of enrollment should receive study drug 
every 12 hours.  Once ANC  [ADDRESS_123487] 3-7 days of therapy and converted to oral MMF as soon as possible 
after the initial 3-7 days of therapy if oral medications and this limited fluid intake are tolerated.  Duration of Study Therapy  MMF/placebo should be discontinued at Day 56, or when the patient is tapered off steroids, 
whichever occurs earlier.  GVHD Prophylaxis Medications  Medications such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus,  sirolimus (if used as GVHD prophylaxis when 
acute GVHD developed) should be continued at therapeutic doses adjusted as necessary for 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Acute GVHD Treatment – Protocol 0802 
Version 3.0 dated January 31, 2011 
 
 
2-6 renal, central nervous system (CNS) or ot her toxicity using c onventional ma nagement 
guidelines.  The recommended therapeutic tr ough level of cyclosporine is 200-400 ng/mL 
measured by [CONTACT_110881]; institutional levels for other assays.  The recommended 
therapeutic trough level is 5-15 ng/mL for t acrolimus and 3-12 ng/mL for sirolimus.   
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_110837] : 
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_110838], including skin creams or GI non-absorbable steroids are 
allowed and should be used according to institu tional practices.  Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_110839] a secondary endpoint assessment in this trial. 
 Ancillary/supportive care measures for acute GVHD such as the use of anti-motility agents for 
diarrhea, including octreotide, is allowed at th e discretion of the treating physician.  Use of 
ursodiol to prevent/ reduce gall bladder sludging, or  prevent hepatic transp lant complications is 
also allowed according to institutional guidelines.  2.5. Toxicities and Guidelines for Dose  Reduction/Withholding Study Drug 
 Infection: 
Mycophenolate mofetil is potent im munosuppressive agent.  Its use has been associated with 
increased risks of opportunistic infections.  In  the acute GVHD setting, where corticosteroids and 
the disease itself further compromise the immune system, particular caution must be paid to the risks of additional infections.  See Section 2.[ADDRESS_123488] their study drug held at the attending physician's 
discretion.  Study drug can be reinstituted when  the infection epi[INVESTIGATOR_110840].  Re placement doses must not be given, and administration of the 
study drug should not be extended.  Administra tion of the study drug will be discontinued 
permanently if administration is suspended for more than 14 days . 
 GI toxicity: 
Administration of MMF may produce diarrhea, abdo minal pain, and vomiting.  Gastrointestinal 
bleeding and bowel perforation have also been de scribed infrequently.  If GI toxicity requires 
medication for control of persistent vomiting or diarrhea (not related to GVHD), a dose reduction to twice a day can be instituted or, if symptoms persist and are severe (Grade 3 or 4), the study drug (MMF/placebo) can be stopped for 48-72 hours.  IV MMF can be used in patients 
experiencing severe GI toxicity to avoid stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_11743].  If GI toxicity does not resolve 
within 48-72 hours of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648], then this  toxicity is not likely related to the study 
medication and the drug should be  restarted at the original dos e.  Administration of the study 
drug will be discontinued permanently if administration is suspended for more than 14 days.  The Protocol Chair or co-Chair should be consulte d before discontinuing MMF for GI toxicity.   
 Myelosuppression:   
Use of MMF may be associated with myel osuppression.  If the ANC is less than 1000/ PL, 
MMF/placebo dosing should be reduced to every 12 hour dosing.  2QFH$1&TKRXU
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Acute GVHD Treatment – Protocol 0802 
Version 3.0 dated January 31, 2011 
 
 
2-7 dosing should be resumed.  If the ANC is less than 500/ PL, the drug should be discontinued until 
neutrophil recovery occurs, and restarted at q12 h our dosing.  Use of filgrastim or perfilgrastim 
or sarmograstim or discontinuation of other myelosuppressive agents  is allowed.  Administration 
of the study drug will be disconti nued permanently if administrati on is suspended for more than 
14 days . 
 Guidelines for Renal Insufficiency:  
As free MPA exposure has not been  directly correlated with re nal dysfunction, pa tients on renal 
replacement therapy are excluded from entry on this trial.  However, if renal insufficiency (estimated GFR <25) develops or  dialysis is needed after st udy entry, the study drug dose should 
be reduced from every 8 to every 12 hours.  Hepatic Dysfunction:  
No adjustments of MMF/placebo ar e required for liver dysfunction. 
 Other Unexpected Toxicities: 
Study drug may be held for other  CTC v.3 Grade 3-4 toxicities that are considered probably 
related to MMF/study drug (such as severe apthous ulcers, hypogamma globulinemia, red cell 
aplasia) at the discretion of the treating phys ician.  Administration of the study drug will be 
discontinued permanently if administrati on is suspended for more than 14 days . 
 2.6. Unblinding 
 There will be no unblinding or crossover as part of this trial.  Unblinding will be allowed only if 
a critical action is needed, the situation is life -threatening, and the unblinding is deemed to be 
necessary to the patient’s clinical care.  Pe rmission for unblinding must be obtained from the 
medical monitor of the study. Given that there are no data supporting MMF as the preferred 
second line treatment in patients with inadequate responses to first line treatment, unblinding to 
allow patients to receive MMF as second lin e therapy off study will not be allowed. 
 2.7. GVHD Progression or Non-response 
 
If acute GVHD progresses (new organ involvement  or increased organ specific symptoms 
sufficient to increase the organ stage by [CONTACT_110882]) after at least 5 days of study drug administration, or if there is no response (no reduction in any GVHD organ staging) after [ADDRESS_123489] ug may be discontinued, and the 
patient may be treated with a lternative secondary GVHD therapy at the discretion of the treating 
physician.    2.8. Acute GVHD Flare 
 If acute GVHD flares during taper of prednisone, the dose of steroids may be increased at the 
discretion of the treating physician as long as th is increase is to less than 2.5 mg/kg/day of 
prednisone (or methylprednisolone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day), as in this case it will be considered adding a “new agent” and the patient will be scored as a failure.

2-8 2.9. Supportive Care Guidelines 
 In addition to prescribed study drug plus co rticosteroids, all patients should receive the 
following: 
x Transfusion support per institutional practice 
x Anti-infective prophylaxis against herpes viruses, Pneumocystis jiroveci, bacterial and 
fungal infections should be followed accordi ng to standard institutional practices.   
x Routine CMV antigenemia/viral load testi ng by [CONTACT_110883] (with preemptive ganciclovir or valganciclovir therapy in patients who develop a positive assay, as per institutional guidelines).  CMV testing is recommended weekly through at l east Day +[ADDRESS_123490] to both acute and chronic GVHD (if 
present) will be a crucial aspect of this trial.    Weekly acute GVHD organ stage scores, overall clinical grade, biopsy information for GVHD and relevant differential dia gnosis will be recorded and reported to the DCC.  Organ 
involvement, biopsy informati on, staging, differential diagnos is, and GVHD therapy should be 
documented in the medical record using the BMT CTN GVHD scoring stamp or equivalent (see 
below).  Symptoms of chronic GVHD, if present, will be reported according to the BMT CTN MOP (Chapter 2) and reported on the GVHD symptom record.  A sample acute GVHD data record suggested for use in this trial is shown below.

*From BMT CTN MOP Chapter [ADDRESS_123492] for acute GVHD. The BMT CTN Biomarkers Committee suggested four recently published biomarkers fo r validation.  Paczesny et al screened plasma 
with antibody microarrays for 120 proteins in a discovery set of 42 tran splant patients that 
revealed eight potential biomar kers for diagnostic of GVHD.
28  They then measured by [CONTACT_110884] m 424 transplant patients randomly divided into 
training (n = 282) and validation (n = 142) sets.  Logistic regression analysis of these eight 
proteins determined a composite biomarker panel of four proteins  (interleukin-2-receptor-alpha, 
tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1, interleukin-8, a nd hepatocyte growth factor) that optimally 
discriminated patients with a nd without GVHD.  In patients with GVHD, Cox regression 
analysis revealed that the biom arker panel predicted survival i ndependently of GVHD severity.  
The authors suggested that the panel of four biomarkers can confirm the diagnosis of GVHD in 
patients at onset of clinical symptoms of GVHD and provide prognostic in formation independent 
of GVHD severity.

 3.2. Secondary Endpoints 
 Response Definitions: 
CR is defined as a CIBMTR score of [ADDRESS_123494] had no intervening a dditional therapy for an earlier progression, PR or NR. 
Partial response (PR) is defined as improve ment in one or more organs involved with 
GVHD symptoms without progression in others.   For a response to be scored as PR at Day [ADDRESS_123495] had no intervening additional therapy for an earlier progressi on, PR or no response (NR).   
Mixed response  (MR) is defined as improvement in on e or more organs with deterioration 
in another organ manife sting symptoms of GVHD or development of symptoms of GVHD 
in a new organ.   
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Acute GVHD Treatment – Protocol [ADDRESS_123496] one organ withou t any improvement in 
others.   
No response (NR) is defined as absence of any improvement or progression as defined.  
Patients receiving secondary therapy (including need to re-escalate ste URLG GRVH WR   2.5 
mg/kg/day of prednisone [or met hylprednisolone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day]) will be classified 
as non-responders.  3.2.1.  Proportion of CR, PR, MR , NR and Progression 
 Proportion of Complete Response (CR), Partia l Response (PR), Mixed Response (MR), No 
Response (NR) and Progression among surv iving patients at Days 14, 28 and 56:   Scoring of 
CR, PR, MR, NR and progression are in compar ison to the participant’s acute GVHD status 
(score) on Day 0 of the study.  3.2.2.  Proportion of Primary Treatment Failures 
 Proportion of primary treatment failures am ong surviving patients at Days 14, 28 and 56: No 
response, progression, administrati on of additional systemic ther apy for GVHD (or re-escalation 
RIVWHURLGGRVHWRPJNJGD\RISUHGQLVRQH or methylprednisolone  equivalent of 2 
mg/kg/day), or mortality by [CONTACT_2006] 14, [ADDRESS_123497] -initiation of treatment will be considered a 
primary treatment failure.  3.2.3.  GVHD Flares Requiring Additional Therapy 
 Flares are defined as any progression of acute GVHD after an initial response (i.e., earlier CR or PR) that requires re-escalation of steroid dosi ng, or initiation of additiona l topi[INVESTIGATOR_110845].  While all “flares” will be captured, only flares that requi re additional systemic therapy 
(that is additional drugs) or re -escalation of steroids to PJNJGD\RISUHGQLVRQH> or 
methylprednisolone equi valent of 2 mg/kg/day] will be c ounted as failure for the primary 
endpoint.  The rate of all flares before Day 90 will be examined as a secondary endpoint 
 3.2.4.  Immunosuppression Discontinuation 
 Discontinuation of immunosuppres sion will be assessed by [CONTACT_2006] 56, Day 180 and Day 360.  The 
date of discontinuation of  corticosteroids will be recorded.  In addition, dates for discontinuation 
of all other systemic immunosuppre ssive medications (where app licable), including cyclosporine 
or tacrolimus, sirolimus, etc. for treatment or prevention of acute GVHD will be captured. 
 3.2.5.  Steroid Dose at Days 28 and 56 after Randomization 
 Doses of methylprednisolone w ill be converted to prednisone  equivalents by [CONTACT_110885] 1.25.  Pr ednisone doses for each patient  will be converted to mg/kg. 
The cumulative prednisone dose for each patient at Day 28 will be calculated by [CONTACT_110886] (end of each week’s dose) for each of th e first four weeks of treatment, divided by [CONTACT_110887] – Protocol 0802 
Version 3.0 dated January 31, 2011 
 
 
3-3 number of days of survival during this interval.  The prednisone dose for each patient at Day 28 
and Day 56 will be recorded  3.2.6.  Incidence of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/Non-absorbable Therapy by [CONTACT_2006] 56 
 The proportion of patients using eith er topi[INVESTIGATOR_110846]. 
 3.2.7.  Chronic GVHD 
 Chronic GVHD is defined per the BMT CTN Ma nual of Procedures (MOP) Chapter 2.  The 
incidence of chronic GVHD at 6 and 12 months will be computed for each treatment arm.  3.2.8.  Overall and GVHD-free Survival 
 Overall survival and GVHD-free survival at Days 180 and 360 will be computed for each 
treatment arm.  3.2.9.  Systemic Infections though Day 180 
 All microbiologically documented infecti ons or significant infections requiring 
antibiotic/antifungal therapy occurring within six m onths of initiation of th erapy will be reported 
by [CONTACT_4622], date of onset, and sever ity.  For definitions see the BMT CTN MOP.   
 3.2.10.  Incidence of EBV 
 Participating sites are to collect any incidence of  EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder or 
EBV reactivation requiring therapy though Day 360.  3.2.11.  Disease-free Survival at [ADDRESS_123498]-randomization 
 Non-relapse mortality at 6 and 12 months will be computed for each treatment arm.  The events for non-relapse mortality are death due to a ny cause other than relapse of the underlying 
malignancy.  3.2.13.  Change in Patient-reported Outcomes from Enrollment to Day 56 
 Study participants who are able to communicat e in English will self-complete the M.D. 
Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) at enrollme nt prior to randomization and at Day 56 +/- 
7 days.  The MDASI is a 19 item instrument that captures 13 symptoms (0=“not present” to 10=“as bad as you can imagine”) and 6 items meas uring interference with life from 0 (“did not 
interfere”) to 10 (“interfered completely”).  See the MDASI in Appendix E.  It provides two

Version 3.0 dated January 31, 2011 
 
 
3-4 summary scales: symptoms and interference.[ADDRESS_123499] data.  Although the 
MDASI has been psychometrically validated in  8 languages, including Spanish, given the 
exploratory nature of this e ndpoint we will only administer the MDASI to patients who are able 
to communicate in English.  Surveys may not be completed by [CONTACT_110888]. 
 NOTE:  Long-term follow-up of patients on this study will con tinue through routine CIBMTR 
mechanisms.

 4. PATIENT ENROLLMENT AND EVALUATION 
 4.1. Enrollment and Randomization 
 Patients will be registered using the BMT CTN Advantage Electronic Data Capture (EDC).  The following procedures shall be followed: 
1. An authorized user at the clinical center completes the initial screening by [CONTACT_110889] A informa tion (inclusion/exclusion criteria) of the 
Eligibility Form within [ADDRESS_123500] emic therapy of acute GVHD.  
Patients will be randomized to MMF versus placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  Treatme nt should be initiated 
as soon as possible after randomization.  A maximum of 48 hours is allowable. 
 4.2. Study Monitoring 
 4.2.1.  Follow-up Schedule 
 The Follow-up Schedule for scheduled study vi sits is outlined in Table 4.2.1.  A detailed 
description of each of the forms and the procedures required for forms completion and 
submission can be found in the Data Management Handbook and User’s Guide. 
 Follow-up Assessments : The timing of follow-up visits is ba sed on the date of randomization.  
Following randomization, the Transplant Center can print a Patient Visit Schedule listing target 
dates for assessments.  Weeks 1-8 visits are prim arily for acute GVHD scoring.  The subsequent 
visits are for follow-up reports.  Criteria for Forms Submission : Criteria for timeliness of sub mission for all study forms are 
detailed in the Data Ma nagement Handbook and User’s Guide.  Forms that are not received at 
the DCC within the specified time will be consid ered delinquent.  Transplant Centers can view 
past due forms via the Web-based data entry system.  A missing form will continue to appear until the form is entered into the DCC’s master database, or until an exception is granted and 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Acute GVHD Treatment – Protocol 0802 
Version 3.0 dated January 31, 2011 
 
 
4-2 entered into the Missing Form Exception File, as detailed in the Da ta Management Handbook 
and User’s Guide.  Reporting Patient Deaths:  The Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_110847]-
based data entry system within 24 hours of knowledge of a patient’s death.  If the cause of death 
is unknown at that time, it need not be recorded at  that time.  However, once the cause of death is 
determined, the form  must be updated.  
 Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) Data Reporting:  Centers participating in BMT CTN trials must register pre and post-transplant 
outcomes on all consecutive hemat opoietic stem cell transplants done at their institution during 
their time of participatio n to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research 
(CIBMTR).  Registration is done using procedur es and forms of the Stem Cell Transplant 
Outcomes Database (SCTOD).  (N ote: Federal legislation require s submission of these forms for 
all US allotransplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].)  Additionally, CIBMTR pre- and post- transplant Report Forms must also be submitted for all patients enrolle d on this trial according to the randomization 
assigned to the patient at the time of initial registration with the CIBMTR.

 GVHD scoring will be performed weekly for 8 weeks from study entry.  Days 0, 28 and 56 (+3 
days) scoring must be performed by [CONTACT_110890].  Evaluations at 
other time points may be performed by [CONTACT_110891]. 
 4.2.4.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
Unexpected, grade 3-5 adverse events (AE) will be reported through an expedited AE reporting system 
via AdvantageEDC.  Unexpected, grade 4-[ADDRESS_123506] be reported within three business days of knowledge of the event.  Unexpected, grade 3-5 AEs will be reported usi ng NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0.  Expected AEs will  be reported using NCI’s Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ) Version 3.[ADDRESS_123507] will receive summary reports of all Grade 3-5 unexpected adverse experiences on an annual basis.  4.2.5.  Study Drug Dose Reduction Monitoring 
 Because the dosing schedule of MMF in this trial will be more frequent (q8hrs) compared to the 
previous phase II trial, additional monitoring for potential toxicity will be implemented.  Patients who are felt to have potential t oxicity related to the study drug (MMF/Placebo) may have their 
dosing reduced from TID to BID dosing at the discretion of the treating physician as outlined in Section 2.5.  The dose and schedule of MMF/place bo will be recorded weekly.  After [ADDRESS_123508] 1 week wit hout re-escalation of dose.  If the incidence of 
sustained dose reduction in the MMF arm is >30% higher than that observed in the placebo arm, 
the protocol team will consult with the Data  and Safety Monitoring Board and consider 
amending the starting MMF/placebo dose to  BID dosing for the entire study.  
 4.3. Discontinuation Criteria 
 Study drug therapy (MMF or placebo) shall be di scontinued and not re-ins tituted if any one of 
the following criteria is met.  The patient will be  taken off study drug therapy at that point, but 
still followed for primary and secondary study endpoint s.  A response assessme nt will be made at 
the time of therapy discontinuation and at subseq uent defined study endpoints.  The patient will 
not be replaced on study.  Note: though the study drug will be discontinued in the following circumstances, corticosteroid dosing will be managed as clinically indicated by [CONTACT_1963].  Follow-up data will be  required unless consent for data collection is withdrawn: 
x Additional systemic GVHD therapy is added for disease progression or non-response

 5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 5.1. Study Design 
 The study is designed as a Phase III, rando mized, double-blind, multicenter, prospective 
comparative study of steroids + MMF vs. steroids  + placebo for treatment of acute GVHD.  The 
target enrollment is 372 patients.  5.1.1.   Accrual 
 It is estimated that three years of accrual will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.  Both Core and non-Core Centers will enroll patients on this study.  Accrual will be reported by 
[CONTACT_545], ethnicity, gender, and age (pediatric  patients will be defi ned as < 18 years). 
 5.1.2.  Randomization 
 Randomization will be performed in a 1:[ADDRESS_123509] ratified by [CONTACT_110892] (I-II vs. III-IV) at 
study entry.  5.1.3.  Primary Endpoint 
 The primary endpoint is the GVHD-free survival  proportion at Day [ADDRESS_123510] randomization.  The 
primary analysis will be performed using the intent-to-treat principle so that all randomized patients will be included in the analysis.  Deat h, lack of CR at Day 56, initiation of additional 
therapy, or development of chronic GVHD will be considered failures for this endpoint.  Flares 
of acute GVHD after achieving CR will not result in  a failure for the primary endpoint as long as 
the patient still achieves CR at Day 56 and does not need additional therapy.  5.1.4.  Primary Hypothesis 
 The primary null hypothesis of the study is that there is no difference between the GVHD-free 
survival proportions for MMF compared to the placebo arm.

5-2 Sample size and power considerations are ba sed on estimates from BMT CTN Protocol 0302, the 
randomized Phase II study on which this Phase III study is based.  In BMT CTN 0302, the estimated Day 56 GVHD-free survival was 71% for the MMF arm (n=44) and 47% for the three combined non-MMF arms (n=134).  Although th e observed difference in GVHD-free survival 
proportions was 24%, this was base d on a small sample size for the MMF arm.  In this study, we 
target a more modest difference of 15%, which wo uld still be considered c linically relevant.  The 
sample size of 186 patients per group, or 372 total, is sufficient to maintain type I error of 5% 
across all planned interim analyses (see below) while providing 80% statistical power for a two-
sided test to detect an increase in the GVHD-fr ee survival proportion at Day [ADDRESS_123512] (DSMB) at 
approximately six month intervals.  Monitori ng of key safety e ndpoints will be conducted 
monthly, and if rates significantly exceed pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can be advised.  Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in the 
BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures.  5.3.1.  Interim Analysis for Efficacy and Futility 
 Analyses will be performed as described belo w for the primary endpoint.  Toxicity, adverse 
events, and other safety endpoints will be monitore d regularly and reported to the DSMB at each 
interim analysis.   At each interim analysis time point, a two-sided test to detect either an increase or decrease in the 
GVHD-free survival proportion at Day [ADDRESS_123513] statistic is outside the continuation range, the DSMB will discuss the continuation of the trial.  In order to preserve the over-all type I error ra te at 5%, efficacy and futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_110849] I e rror rate alpha and the type II

5-4 5.3.3.  Guidelines for Safety Monitoring 
 Monitoring of a key safety endpoint will be conduc ted monthly, and if rates significantly exceed 
pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can be advised.  Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in  the BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures.  The 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_110854]. 
 The key safety endpoint for this study is mortality.  The rate of mortality will be monitored up to 
[ADDRESS_123515] be observed in order to trigger review.  Each month, the null hypothesis th at the 28-day mortality rate is less than or 
equal to 7.5% is tested.  An exte nsion of the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for censored 
exponential data w ill be used for monitoring, as descri bed in greater detail below and in 
Appendix D.  This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error at 5% across all of the monthly 
examinations.  The SPRT can be represented graphically.  At each monthly interim analysis, the total time on study is plotted against the total number of endpoints (e.g. , patients experiencing 
death).  The continuation region of the SPRT is defined by [CONTACT_110893].  Only the lower 
boundary will be used for monitoring to protect ag ainst excessive 28-day mortality.  If the graph 
falls below the lower boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that there 
are more events than predicted by [CONTACT_110894] d time on study.  Otherwise, the SPRT continues 
until enrollment reaches the maximum of [ADDRESS_123516], summed for all patients on study. 
 
The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities D and E of rejecting 
H
0 when T = T0 and of accepting H 1 when T = T1, respectively, and the expected sample size 
E(N|Ti).  The tests to be used in this protocol  were developed from the following SPRTs:   
x A SPRT contrasting 7.5% versus 22.5% 28-day rate of mortality re sults in decision 
boundaries with a common slope of 6.695 and a lower intercept of –12.691, with nominal 
type I and II errors of 9% and 15%, respectively. 
 The actual operating characteristics of the truncated  test, shown in Table 5.3c, were determined 
in a simulation study that assumed uniform accr ual of 186 individuals over a three-year time 
period, and exponential time to fa ilure after randomization.

For example, the testing procedur e rejects the null hypothesis in fa vor of the alternative 5% of 
the time when the true 28-day mortality rate is  7.5%, and 93% of the time when the rate is 
17.5%.  This corresponds to a type I error rate of D = 0.05 and a type II error rate of E = 0.07.  
When the true 28-day mortality rate is 17.5% , on average, the DSMB will be consulted [ADDRESS_123517] ug.  The type and severity of 
adverse events will be described.  5.3.5.  Monitoring Guidelines for Dose Reduction 
 Rates of dose reduction w ill be compared between the blinde d study arms early in accrual to 
determine whether there is evidence of a differential rate.  Such a difference would indicate that the starting dose should be decreased from 3 times daily to 2 times dail y.  Dose reduction is 
defined as one week of sustained dose reduction from TID dosing through Day 28.  It is anticipated that rates of dose reduction will be  low in the placebo arm, approximately 10-20%, 
and the monitoring rule is designed to identify a 30% absolute difference in dose reduction rates 
between the two study arms with 80% power.  If th e monitoring rule is triggered, the DSMB will 
be notified and asked to review unblinded toxicity data in the two arms to assess whether the 
starting dose of MMF should be decreased.  The dose reduction stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_110855]  O’Brien-Fleming boundary  for the Z statistic

  1. Background  
 This research study is sponsored by [CONTACT_110899] l Institutes of Health (NIH) through the Blood 
and Marrow Transplant Clinical Tr ials Network (BMT CTN).  The goal of this study is to find a 
better treatment for acute GVHD in people who have had an alloge neic blood stem cell 
transplant.   Acute GVHD is a medical condition that can be come very serious.  Acute GVHD is a common 
development after allogeneic stem cell transplant . It happens when the donor cells attack and 
damage your tissues after transpla nt.  Acute GVHD often causes:  
 Skin rashes 
 Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) 
 Vomiting (throwing up) 
 Abdominal pain 
 Diarrhea  
 Liver damage that can cause inflammation in the liver or jaundice (yellowing of the skin 
or eyes)

B-3 Patients with acute GVHD are at risk to develop chronic GVHD.  Chronic GVHD may also 
cause damage to other organs.  Acute and chronic GVHD may be bad enough to cause death. 
 Corticosteroid (or steroid) medications, such as prednisone, are the standard of care for early 
treatment of GVHD.  However, le ss than half of patients will become free of acute GVHD when 
steroid treatment is used alone. Inform ation from a BMT CTN study suggests that 
Mycophenolate mofetil or “MMF” in combination w ith standard steroid therapy may lower the 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_110861].   MMF is a drug that blocks the growth of the immune cells (T lymphocytes), which are believed 
to cause GVHD.  MMF is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent 
rejection after organ transplant .  MMF has been used for years as a treatment for GVHD that 
does not respond to standard corticosteroid ther apy, or to prevent GVHD after allogeneic stem 
cell transplant.    2. Purpose  
 You are invited to join this research study be cause you have developed acute graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD) and your doctor feels that treatment for the GVHD is necessary.   
 We will measure how the addition of MMF compares  long-term to the standard treatment of 
steroids for acute GVHD.  Specifically, we also want to know if MMF will: 
 Reduce the symptoms and signs of acute GVHD, or  
 Eliminate acute GVHD completely.  
 
MMF will be compared to a placebo (sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) to  learn if it will reduce or eliminate your acute 
GVHD when added to the standard  treatment of steroids.  
 We also want to collect extra blood samples a nd mouth swabs for future research on GVHD.  
You may take part in this add itional study if you want to.  You can  still be part of the main study 
even if you do not want to donate extra blood samples.   3. Right to Ask Questions and/or Withdraw

 Before you join the study, we will ask you about your medical history, and any medications you 
may be taking.  It is important that you do not  participate in the study if you suffer from an 
allergy to  mycophenolate mofetil (MMF); or if you are pregnant, breastfeeding or are likely to 
become pregnant during the study.   Your doctor will do a number of te sts to determine if you are able to join this study.  These tests 
include: 
 A physical exam that also measures the stage of your GVHD. 
 Your ability to do regular daily activities (performance status). 
 Routine blood tests to check your blood count s, how well your liver and kidneys work, 
and levels of GVHD prevention medicati ons in your blood (if it applies to you). 
 Pregnancy test (if it applies to you). 
 If you decide to join, we will ask you to sign th is Consent Form, and you will get a copy of the

B-6  Routine blood tests including your blood count s, how well your liver and kidneys work, 
and levels of GVHD prevention medicati ons in your blood (if it applies to you) 
 The evaluations at week [ADDRESS_123537] be do ne at the transplant center.  Other exams and 
tests may be done at the transplant center or at  a local doctor’s office if your condition improves 
and it is closer to where you live, at th e discretion of your transplant doctor.  
 These tests and how often they are scheduled are standard care for patients with acute GVHD 
and would be done even if you we re not part of this study. 
  5. Alternative Treatments  
 Current available treatments which may be used to treat acute GVHD include: 
 Corticosteroids without the study drug (standard treatment for GVHD) 
 Participation in another c linical trial (if available, check with your doctor) 
 Every treatment option has benefits and risks.  Your study doc tor will discuss these options with 
you.  If you decide not to participate in this rese arch study, your medical care will not be affected 
in any way.   6. Risks and Discomforts  
 
a.) Side Effects of Study Drugs 
All drugs can have side effects, including th e standard therapy for GVHD (steroids) and 
MMF being tested in this study.  Your doc tor will watch you carefu lly and will change 
your treatment if side effects develop.  MMF used in addition to steroids for GVHD is an 
experimental treatment , but information has already been collected on its effects in 
people.  We have a limited amount of informa tion about children (p ediatric patients) 
treated with MMF for GVHD.    Placebo:   The placebo will look and taste like MMF (myc ophenolate mofetil) but it is not a drug.  
The placebo is not expected to have any si de effects and it will have no effect on your 
condition.  Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF):   MMF is a potent immunosuppressive drug that bl ocks the growth of the immune cells 
that can cause GVHD.   Risks and side effects related to MMF include those that are : 
 Common (more than 20% of patients) 
 Infection 
 Upset stomach, including nausea

B-7 Less common (less than 20% of patients)  
 Low blood counts  
 Vomiting  
 Diarrhea 
Rare but serious (less th an 2-3% of patients) 
 Serious injury to your gut (digestive tract), including bloody stools and vomit 
 Secondary cancers, such as lymphopr oliferative disease or lymphoma  
 Serious infections of the brain 
 Risk to a baby [CONTACT_110901]  
 Progressive Multifocal Le ukoencephalopathy (PML) 
 
b.) Infections 
Because GVHD is caused by [CONTACT_110902], all treatments fo r GVHD include drugs to cont rol (suppress) that immune 
attack. There is a higher risk of infecti on in patients with GVHD and any treatment for 
GVHD may also increase your risk of infecti on.  Infections may be bad enough to cause 
death.  You will need to take several antibiotics to prevent infecti on.  You will also be watched 
carefully for any infections while you are being treated for GVHD.  Tell your doctors 
promptly if you get a fever, chills, cough or a ny other symptoms that might be a sign of 
an infection.  
c.) Risks of Other Procedures Including Blood Draws   
There are no major risks associated with  drawing blood.  Having your blood drawn can 
be uncomfortable and can sometimes cause a bruise.  In rare cases, a blood draw can cause fainting.  Only trained people will draw your blood.  
d.) Reproductive Risks 
MMF may cause injury or birth defects if it is  taken during pregnancy.  Because of this, it 
is important that you are not pregnant or breast-feeding and do not become pregnant 
during the course of the study.  
If you are a woman and pregnancy is a possibilit y, you will need to take a pregnancy test 
before you start the study.  You should discuss ways to not become pregnant while you 
are participating on the study.  Unless you have been in menopause for at least [ADDRESS_123538] either use abstinence or two 
non-hormone forms of birth control (such as a condom, diaphragm, or spermicide).  You 
must continue to prevent pr egnancy before and during your treatment with MMF, and for 
at least [ADDRESS_123539] for you.  If you do become pregnant while you are in 
the study, you should tell your doctor right aw ay.  You will be removed from the study

e.) Unforeseen Risks 
New risks might appear at any time during the study that are different from the risks 
listed in this Consent Form.  We will promp tly tell you of any new information that may 
affect your decision to participate.  
f.) Other Treatments or Medications  
Some medicines react with each other, and it is important that you tell the study doctor or 
staff about any other drugs, treatme nts, or medicines you are taking.   
 This includes non-prescription me dications, vitamins and herbal  treatments.  It is also 
important that you tell the study staff about a ny changes to these medications during your 
participation in the study.  
g.) Risks of completing the survey 
Completion of the survey about your sy mptoms will not cause you any physical 
discomfort, although it is possible that you will find some of the questions or topi[INVESTIGATOR_110862].  If you do, there will be someone av ailable to speak with you.  They will be 
able to refer you to appropriate counselors or other support people. 
  7. Possible Benefits  
 Taking part in this study may or may not make your h ealth better.  While doctors hope that MMF 
in combination with steroids will be more us eful against acute GVHD compared to the usual 
treatment, there is no proof of this yet.  We do know that the information from this study will 
help doctors learn more about MMF in the trea tment of acute GVHD.  This information could 
help future allogeneic transplant patients   8. New Information Available During the Study  
 During this research study, new information about the study drug or the risks and benefits of the 
study may become known to the study doctors.  If this happens, they will tell you about the new 
information.  The new information may mean that you can no long er participate in the study, or that you may not 
want to continue in the study.  If this happens, the study doctor will stop your participation in the 
study and you will be offered all available car e to suit your needs and medical conditions.

  Please note: This section of the informed Co nsent Form is about an  additional research 
study that will be done with people who are taking part in the main study.  You may take part in this additional study if you want to.  You can still be a part of the main study even if you say ‘no’ to take part in this additional study.  
  Blood and DNA Samples for Research  
We are asking your permission to collect and store extra blood and a DNA sample.  These 
samples will be used for future research on GVHD tests and treatment.  DNA is a molecule that contains a person’s genetic information.  We would collect a sample of your DNA by [CONTACT_2329] a 
mouth swab.  DNA from your stored blood and DNA samples and your  health information might be used in 
genome-wide association (GWA) studies for a future project either done or supported by [CONTACT_4878] (NIH).  Genome-wide association studies are a way for scientists to identify genes involved in human disease.  This  method searches the genome for small genetic 
changes that are more common in people with a particular disease than in people without the 
disease.  Each study can look at hundreds of thous ands of genetic change s at the same time.  
Researchers use data from this type of study to  find genes that may add to a person’s risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a certain disease.  If your coded geneti c and clinical information is used in such a 
study, the researcher is required to add the DNA test results and non-identifying information into 
a public research database.  Th is public database is called the NIH Genotype and Phenotype 
Database and it is mana ged by [CONTACT_29070] (NCBI).  The 
NCBI will never have any information that w ould identify you, or link you to your information 
or research samples.  A new federal law (2009), called the Genetic  Information Nondiscr imination Act (GINA) 
generally makes it illegal for hea lth insurance companies, group he alth plans, and employers of 
[ADDRESS_123544] 
genetic discrimination by [CONTACT_55173], disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.

 Protocol : 0802 
  A. Why am I here? 
We are inviting you to join our study because you have acute graft-versus-host disease 
(GVHD).  We want to learn if a new drug works better than the current drug we use to treat 
GHVD.  GVHD happens when your donor cells from your transplant attack parts of the body like 
your skin, stomach or liver.  Both kids and adu lts can get GVHD.  It can be a very serious 
problem for some people.   
B. Why are you doing this study? 
We are doing this study because we want to lear n if a single drug or a combination of drugs 
work better to get rid of gr aft-versus-host disease (GVHD). 
 Prednisone with a sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (placebo) or 
 Prednisone with MMF  (mycophenate mofetil) . 
  
C. What will happen to me? 
If you say you want to be in the study, we will ask you for several things: 
 Permission to let us read your medical records and x-rays.  
 Check-ups with the study doctors.  
 Some blood from you (about 12 teaspoons).  A ve ry small needle will be used to get 
blood.  
 We may also need a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] (biopsy) of  your skin, so we can study changes in 
your skin.  If you agree to this, we will use numbing medicine before we take a small 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_110864] a special tool called a “punch.”

B-18  
Everyone in the study wi ll take prednisone. 
 You will also take MMF or sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (place bos).  The doctors use a computer to choose 
which one. You will not know whic h drug you will take.  The computer will keep it a secret 
from everyone, including the study doctors.  If you get very sick, your study doctors can find 
out from the computer which drugs you take.  You will take the MMF or sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] [ADDRESS_123549] to swallow, the doctors can use a small needle to  give it through your vein (IV) or your central 
line.  Once you finish taking the drugs, you will have ab out 4 more check-ups with either the study 
doctors or your regular doctor over the next 12 months.    We will watch you carefully for fevers, any sign of infection or other problems. 
  
D. Will it hurt? 
When you have your blood taken with a needle, it may feel like a pi[INVESTIGATOR_820].  It will hurt for a 
minute and sometimes the place where the needle went might be red a nd sore. You might get 
a little bruise where the blood was take n but it goes away in a few days. 
 If you have a skin biopsy, the numbing medicine  burns when it goes in, but only for a few 
seconds.  When the numbing medicine wears off, there may be some mild pain.  It will leave 
a small scar.   
E. Will the study help me? 
We don’t know if the study will help you or not .  Your GVHD may stay the same, it may get 
better, or it may get worse.   
F. What if I have questions? 
You can ask any questions that you have about the study.  If you forget to ask a question and 
think of it later, you can call me [insert office number].  You can also ask your question the 
next time you see me.  You can call the study office at any time to ask questions about the study.   
G. Do I have to be in this study? 
If you don’t want to be in the study, you need to tell us and your parent or guardian.  Your 
doctor will not be angry or upset  if you don’t want to join.   
 Whether you are in the study or not, you will s till need to have treatment for your GVHD.

  Background – The Sequential Probability Ratio Test  Let 
)(.,Tf be the density function for random variable  X.  According to Neyman and Pearson,

improvement is possible by [CONTACT_110910]’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT).  The SPRT 
continues to sample as long as A LBn  for some constant A B[ADDRESS_123558]!, and stops sampling and decides in favor of 0Has soon 
as B Ln. 
 
The usual measures of performance of such a procedure are the error probabilities DandEof

 For the SPRT with error probabilities

operating characteristics of the test. 
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Acute GVHD Treatment – Protocol [ADDRESS_123559] for the composite null hypothesis that the rate 
of treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 100 days  is less than or equal to 30% versus the 
alternative hypothesis that it is greater than or equal to 50%.  For the derivation of the 
uncensored SPRT, we will require that the type I e rror of the test be less than 5%, and that the 
test provide 80% power to reject the null hypothe sis under a specified alte rnative that the true 
rate is 50%.  A maximum sample size of 50 patients will be permitted.  Let us assume that the survival times, 
nT TT ,...,,2 1 , are completely observed (uncensored) and are 
i.i.d. with exponentia l density function Te TfTTT ),( .  These assumptions will be relaxed to 
incompletely observed data s ubsequently.  In the exponen tial parameterization, a 100-day 
survival rate of 70% translates in to a mean survival of 0.768 years (  0T1.303), and 50% 
translates into a mean survival of 0.395 years (  1T2.532). 
 
The SPRT is derived with reference to a simple  null and alternative hypot hesis, in this case, 
  o HTT:0  1.303 versus1 1:TT H  = 2.532.  However, since the log-likelihood ratio for the 
exponential,  ¦  n

ii i i T n xf xf ) ()) log() (log( ),( log);( log0 1 0 1 0 1 TTTT T T , is a 
monotone function of ¦n
iiT, the power of the test is non-decreasing in T.  Thus the SPRT is a 
one-sided level .[ADDRESS_123560] of a composite null ( 303.1 :0 do HTT ) versus a composite alternative 
( 303.1 :1 to HTT ), with power of 80. 1 E  at the selected alternative   1TT 2.532. 
 
The SPRT can be represented graphically.  Th e continuation region is bounded by [CONTACT_110911]    ) /() log (log1 0 1 0 TTTT 0.541, and intercepts  ) /( log1 0TTA -2.256 
and  ) /( log1 0TTB 1.270, for the lower and upper bounds, respectively.  As each individual unit 
is put on trial and observed to fail, the cumulative sum of failure times, ¦n
iiT, is recomputed, and 
plotted against the current sample size, n.  When this graph crosses the lower boundary, the null 
hypothesis is rejected. 
 The maximum sample size of [ADDRESS_123561] 
the null at a sample size of 50 is negligible , it makes little differenc e how the final boundary 
value is selected, and this rule is chosen for simplicity.    
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Acute GVHD Treatment – Protocol [ADDRESS_123562] a 
clinical study by [CONTACT_110912], and waiting until that individual is observed to 
fail.  We relax our assumptions as follows.  Firstly, each individual’s time on study will be 
computed as time from transplant to failure, or to the [ADDRESS_123563] of relaxing these assumptions one at a time.  In a fixed sample size 
trial with uncensored exponential failure times, mean survival time is estimated by [CONTACT_110913], or total time on study divided by [CONTACT_110914].  
When censoring is introduced, the estimate becomes the total time on study divided by [CONTACT_110915] (non-censored) failures.  Th is suggests that in an  exponential SPRT test 
modified to incorporate censoring, we  replace the observed failure times, 
nT TT ,...,,[ADDRESS_123564] patient is entere d.  Putting all of this together, we propose a modified truncated 
SPRT, where at any interim time point, s, ranging from 0 to 3 years 100 days, the sum of 
observed time on study, ¦n
iisX)(is plotted against the number of observed failures, )(sd.  In 
practice, monitoring will be scheduled monthly after the start of enrollment to the study.  A 
further modification to the SPRT was to onl y use the lower boundary for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_110868] 100-day TRM rates. 
 
Operating Characteristics of the Modified SPRT Test for Censored Exponential Data  
Recall that the uncensored SPRT targeted a drop in  survival at Day 100 from 70% to 50%, with 
type I and II errors of 5% and 20%.  Since only the lower boundary is used for monitoring, the 
continuation region of the test  was bounded below by a line with a slope of 0.541 and intercept 
of –2.256.  The effect of truncation is to reduce the power of the test.  In order to compensate for 
this, we raise the lower boundary to make it easie r to cross.  Under the further assumption of 
uniform accrual over a three year period, and mont hly interim analyses over the course of the 
study, the operating characteristics of the modified  SPRT were obtained from a simulation study.  
These simulation show that an intercept of –1.741, corresponding to  setting parameters 
D and 
Eto 10% and 15%, result in empi[INVESTIGATOR_110869] I a nd II error rates of  about 5% and 20%.

While the motivation for this testing procedure is largely heuristic rather than theoretical, the 
simulation results validate the approach.  When the true rate of TRM on or before Day 100 was 
30%, the test crossed the lower boundary in 7119 of 100,000 replications, for an estimated type I 
error rate of 7%.  When the true rate of TRM on or before Day 100 was 50%, the test failed to 
cross the boundary in [ZIP_CODE] of 100,000 replications, fo r an estimated type II error rate of 14%.  
And on average, the boundary will be crossed at  18.[ADDRESS_123565] udies to demonstrate this.

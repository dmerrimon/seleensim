Section C:  Background Information
     Falls are a major health concern for the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_679255] (above 65 years of age). Estimates of the
proportion of elderly that fall each year have ranged from 22.1% to almost 40% (Hausdorf f et al., 2001, Shumway-Cook et
al., 2009). Miller et al. found that 8.3% of seniors treated for a fall at an emergency department, returned for treatment of a
secondary fall within 6 months of the initial fall (Miller et al., 2009). The cost of treating a fall requiring any medical care
averages $4100 for Medicare subjects (Shumway-Cook et al., 2009). Falls by [CONTACT_679264] $1 1,408 in costs and increase to $29,363 if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59029] (W oolcott et al.,
2012).
While falls are often multifactoral in cause and subsequently their prevention will require interprofessional interventions,
podiatry is one area of medicine that has recently been increasing its ef forts to better understand and prevent falls (Najafi
et al., 2013a). Prospective research has shown foot and ankle problems which are highly prevalent in older adults (Dunn
et al., 2004), increase the risk of falls (Menz et al., 2006a). This relationship has implications for quality of life and
occurrence of depression (Downton and Andrews, 1991, Quach et al., 2013). The contribution of footwear to falls has in
part been demonstrated by [CONTACT_679265], suggesting that shoes may help prevent falls (Menz et al., 2006b). Previous research has shown that a
multifaceted podiatric intervention utilizing home based foot and ankle exercises, assistance with the purchase of safe
footwear , and provision of prefabricated foot orthoses can reduce the rate of falls in older people with disabling foot pain
(Spi[INVESTIGATOR_149587]., 201 1).
Foot problems, loss of proprioception and decreases in ankle strength and range of motion associated with aging have
been tied to deteriorations in balance and increased fall risk (Anon, 201 1b, Bok et al., 2013). Ankle foot orthoses (AFO) are
intended to keep the foot and ankle in optimal positions and are commonly prescribed with the intent of improving gait and
balance. Previous work with non-pathologic samples has suggested that AFO can facilitate proprioception via stimulation
of cutaneous mechanoreceptors (Feuerbach et al., 1994) and mitigate the impact of fatigued ankle muscles upon stability
(Vuillerme and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_679256], 2007). In the case of peripheral neuropathy subjects, AFO reduced gait variability while walking
on uneven surfaces by [CONTACT_679266] (Richardson et al., 2004, Son et al., 2010). In 2006, there were 75,240 AFO
prescribed under Medicare alone (HCPCS/Alpha-Numeric, 2008). While there is a large volume of studies that have
shown the benefits of AFO for individuals that have suf fered a stroke, multiple sclerosis, Charcot, or non-progressive brain
lesions (Geboers et al., 2002, Menotti et al., 2014, T yson and Kent, 2009), research involving a less restrictive sample of
the older adult population is lacking (Hijmans et al., 2007).
Although a direct objective predictor of fall risk has not been discovered yet, several studies have determined a strong
association between poor postural balance and increased risk of falling. Abnormal postural sway measured by [CONTACT_679267] , for example, has been introduced as a significant independent predictor of recurrent falls (Maki et al., 1994,Thapa
et al., 1996), or as a distinguishable factor among fallers and non-fallers (Lajoie and Gallagher , 2004, Maki et al., 1994).
Therefore if an AFO were able to improve postural stability while avoiding limiting the ankle range of motion, it may
subsequently reduce fall risk in the general older adult population. Hence, the purpose of this investigation was to
determine the immediate ef fect of a custom-made flexible AFO on balance and functional reach distance in a less
restrictive sample of older adults than has been utilized in previous AFO research. W e hypothesize that an open gauntlet
style custom made AFO could improve postural stability . Secondarily , we hypothesize that such an AFO might influence
ankle function in the anterior posterior direction as well as tasks of daily living. T o validate the later hypothesis, we
examined the immediate impact of AFO on timed-up and go (TUG) completion times as a surrogate of motor function
performance during activities of daily living and plantar pressure as measured using a computerized pressure mappi[INVESTIGATOR_679257].

2/6/2020 Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=386666 4/12The eligible subject will contact [CONTACT_679268] f (part of the research team). The subject will be fully informed about the study , and should
voluntarily agree to participate with the guidelines as stipulated in the informed consent. The study coordinator or designee
will introduce the study , present the written consent form, and spend as much time as necessary to ensure the potential
subject completely understands the protocol. Emphasis will be placed on the voluntary nature of participation and the
subject will be assured that his/her care will not be compromised in any way whether or not they choose to participate. The
subject will be informed s/he can withdraw from the study at any time without loss of benefits. Consent forms will then be
signed and dated by [CONTACT_278069] (PI, co-PI, study coordinator , or designee). Once written
consent is obtained, the protocol may begin immediately or a follow-up appointment may be made.
The individual (PI, co-PI, study coordinator , or designee ¿ interns) obtaining consent will be given a thorough training of
the process and go through several mock consent scenarios. The consent training consists of understanding the study and
being able to fully explain it to the participant providing all pertinent information (procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives to
participant), giving suf ficient time to the participant to consider whether or not they would like to participate, and answer
any questions which the subject may have. The training will have a strong emphasis on subject comprehension of the
research study by [CONTACT_63290]-ended questions to the subject. 
The original documents (with signature) will be maintained per IRB policy . Any critical information will be sent for inclusion
in the medical records, if it af fects patient¿s wellbeing and any future treatment. A copy of signed consent form will be
offered to the patient for personal records. Informed consent will be obtained prior to performance of any study
procedures.
Specifically: 1. No minors will be consented. 2. Subjects are given as much time as needed to ask questions and read over
the consent. They are will be given a copy of the consent and can return at a later date if they need to discuss it with family
members, etc. 3. Subjects will be seen in a dedicated research room with no other subjects in the room.
There will be 40 subjects included in this study . There will be 20 subjects in each of the 2 treatment groups (Intervention
and Control). Subjects will be randomized using a 1:[ADDRESS_918794]
visit which is Day 0. Please see page 9 of the protocol attached in Section S.

F2.  Procedure
     Subjects will be screened to ensure that they meet the inclusion criteria of the study . 50 subjects will be recruited and
consented for participation in the study and to achieve the primary endpoints. The subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_918797]¿s plantar
pressure (Using computerized pressure insoles named FScan), balance, activities of daily living, and gait by [CONTACT_216138]-
invasive wearable technology . A series of health related questionnaires (Falls Ef ficacy Scale International (FES-I); Short
form Health Survey (SF-12); V isual Analog Pain Scale (VAS)) will be used to evaluate quality of life and pain intensity
levels. Additionally , the intervention group will be asked to complete a T echnology Acceptance questionnaire to provide
feedback on the tested device. Information related to medical history and demographics will be obtained for statistical
analysis. Subjects will be performing all core measurements as listed below . If necessary , ancillary measurements will also
be done. At the end of the screening visit, the subjects will be randomized into the control or intervention group. Those that
are in the intervention group will be fitted for a custom AFO device and will be asked to return two weeks later to receive
and get educated on it. The control group won't complete the visit at Day 14. They will complete all the other visits and
assessments. 
Core Measurements
Timed-up-and-go: subject will be asked to stand up from a chair , walk [ADDRESS_918798]: will be assessed in double stance and semi-tandem stance while subjects stand straight with hands
crossed around chest for up to 30 seconds with eyes open and closed. 
2/6/2020 Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=386666 5/12Gait assessments: will be done during habitual speed, dual-task (count backward) and during fast walking for a distance of
maximum 20 m. 
Activities of daily living: ADL will be monitored using a validated t-shirt embedded sensor (PamSysTM) during a period of
48 hours (pre and post intervention).
Ancillary Measurements
Questionnaires: Quality of Life (SF-12), Fear of falling (FES-I), Cognitive Impairment (MMSE), Paper T rail Making task,
Foot Questionnaire and Examination, Fried Frailty for frailty assessment, V isual Analog Pain scale for pain assessment,
Depression (CES-D), Demographics. 
Chair Stand test: may be asked to stand up and sit down from a chair to observe lower leg strength and balance. 
Alternate step test: may be asked to alternatively touch a step board (18 cm high and 40 cm deep) with left and right foot 8
times. 
Plantar Pressure: F-scan Plantar Pressure insole (T ekscan Inc) is an in-shoe pressure measurement system that provides
useful information for assessing plantar pressure during walking. It is similar to a standard insole but includes ultra-thin
pressure sensors capturing timing and pressure information for foot function and gait analysis. F-scan is a commercially
available product for the purpose of research and has been used in many prior clinical researches including ours and no
known adverse events were reported. During the visit, we will ask the participant to walk a small distance (approx 15 ft)
with their regular shoes and the study shoes and AFO. After your walk while wearing F-scan insoles, the research team
will take them of f. 
ECG, Heart Rate and HR V: Patients will connect a cardiac activity monitoring patch to his/her body using standard
recording electrode. 
Digital Photographs ¿may take digital photographs of the subjects while performing exercise or during assessments for the
purpose of publication (conferences/manuscripts).
*All measures above will take approximately 1 hour .
Assessing gait and balance using wearable sensors The study will implement two validated technologies based on
wearable sensors named LegSys and BalanSens for assessing respectively spatio-temporal parameters of gait and
postural control in a clinical setting together with other clinically routine assessment (Figure 1). The LegSys device uses
five sensor modules, respectively attached to right and left anterior shins, right and left anterior thighs, and posteriorly to
the lower back. Each sensor measures the angular velocity of the segment around the medio-lateral axis (flexion-
extension). The method for calculating spatio-temporal parameters of gait and balance has been described in detail in
previous publications. 
The following procedures are research-related:
Visit 1 (Baseline) During the first visit you will be required to fill validated health related questionnaires to measure your
pain level, quality of life, and fear of fall. Additionally balance and walking abilities, and activities of daily living will be
quantified using non-invasive inertial sensors. For this purpose, a set of sensors will be attached to your body using elastic
straps. Y ou will be provided with a sensor embedded t-shirt to wear for [ADDRESS_918799] data related to activities of daily
living. Your medical history (from your clinic chart) and demographic information will be obtained, such as age, gender ,
weight, and height.
At the end of the study visit, you will be randomized into either the control or intervention group by a computer-generated
list. If you are randomized (assigned) into the intervention group, the podiatrist will fit you with an AFO device which will be
pi[INVESTIGATOR_679258] (V isit 2). Control group will not visit clinic for V isit 2. 
Visit 3 ¿ 5 (Months 1, 3, and 6) You will be asked to return to the clinic at one, three, and six months after your first visit.
During these visits, you will be required to fill validated health related questionnaires to measure your pain level, quality of
life, and fear of fall. Additionally balance and walking abilities will also be collected. On V isit [ADDRESS_918800] Plantar
Pressure. 
Visit 6 (Month 12) 12 months after the baseline visit, you will be asked to return to clinic. During this final visit, the protocol
followed during V isit 1 will be repeated. Additionally , we will also ask you to fill a satisfaction questionnaire related to
acceptability of intervention (if you were in intervention group). You will also be provided with a sensor embedded t-shirt to
wear for [ADDRESS_918801] Plantar Pressure. 
Please note that subjects in the control group will not complete V isit 2. Visit 2 is only for the intervention group. Subjects in
the control group will complete all other visits same as the intervention group. 
**No subjects will be screened and no screening assessments will be done unless the subject has signed the consent. 
Please see page 9 of the protocol for the schedule of activities.

Provide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan (e.g. comparison of means,
comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance). Which is the PRIMAR Y comparison/analysis? How will the
analyses proposed relate to the primary purposes of your study?
     Data analysis will be done to determine if ef ficacy points are met and to compare dif ferent measurements against others.
 
Section H:  Potential Risks/Discomforts
Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts; (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess the likelihood
and seriousness of such risks:
     The risk to subjects of this study is considered to be minimal because all that is required is simple walking in a controlled
environment with an attendant present (all subjects will be mobile, and walking as a regular part of their activities of daily
living this research routine will not place them at higher risk than normal activities of daily living. No more risk of harm or
discomfort is associated with these tests than the discomfort normally incurred while walking or during normal muscle
stretching. Subjects will be allowed rest time between trials as needed. All ef forts will be exhausted to minimize the risk of
subjects trippi[INVESTIGATOR_679259]. A research team member will stand near the subjects
throughout the experiments to prevent any accident during the measurement.
There is a risk of falling in this study . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_679260] f will be sure to inform the patient about this during the consenting
process. 
We will perform initial screening to ensure the safety of the device. 
The study devices are completely non-invasive, safe, non-toxic and non-ionizing. The potential risks to you are minimal.
However , like any battery powered systems, there is a minimum risk of sensor malfunctioning. In addition, the study
devices are not waterproof, and although they use a low powered battery (similar to a cell-phone battery), in order to avoid
any risk of shock the monitor should not be submerged or saturated with fluids during operations or cleaning. 
Zephyr BioHarness approved via Class 2 devices 510k; 21CFR 870.1025. In addition, for monitoring heart rate, the device
may be attached to the skin using EKG electrodes. Some subjects may have allergies to the adhesive or the adhesive can
damage sensitive skin. If the subject thinks they may have allergies to the adhesive or they have sensitive skin, we will ask
them to inform our staf f. In this case, we may use a belt to record EKG instead of electrodes or not measure your EKG,
upon their preference. There is a risk of interference from Zephyr Bioharness in the functionality of pacemaker/ICD
devices. Therefore, we will ask the subject if they have a pacemaker/ICD device. In this case, we will avoid using Zephyr
on the subject. 
Fscan insoles risk bring no more than minimal risk to the participant as it is non-invasive and they can be easily slipped on
and of f the participant's shoe. There is a small risk of trippi[INVESTIGATOR_679261] F-scan, an elastic band
has to be wrapped around the participant's waist and there are wires that go down to the subject's ankle where it attaches
to the insole. The research team will work hard on minimizing these risks by [CONTACT_679269]. 
All information we will collect about the subject will be stored in a secure location and coded in a way to maintain
confidentiality . Only study personnel will have access to their records. Data collected during the study may be published
and made publicly available. Data may also be shared with other research groups. However , data that could in any way
identify them will not be made public or shared.
The assessments described above are expected to be minimal risk and probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort
anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
Please note that there is also the possibility for loss of confidentiality . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_679262]. The electronic data will be kept on network password protected institutional computers. And, subject PHI will be
coded as much as possible to minimize the potential for loss of confidentiality .

Section I:  Potential Benefits
Describe potential benefit(s) to be gained by [CONTACT_30435] a result of participating in the planned work.
     Subjects will be helpi[INVESTIGATOR_679263], balance and ADL measures. 
There may be the possibility of benefit in this study including an increase in ankle strength and a reduction in the amount
of falls you have. What the researchers find out from this study may help other people who are also at a high risk of falls. It
is part of a prevention initiative to reduce the high number of falls associated with foot problems, loss of proprioception and
decreases in ankle strength and range of motion associated with aging. 
Describe potential benefit(s) to society of the planned work.
     It will also help to design feasible low-cost interventions for those suf fering from balance and gait disorders. In doing so,
subjects will be aiding our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie deterioration in gait and balance which is the
first step towards improving the ef ficacy of treatment.
Do anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks? Discuss the risk-to-benefit ratio.
     As the study is minimal risk study and it might provide the possibility of benefit, the anticipated benefits outweigh any risk
that may be involved.

¿high-tech¿ studies targeted to prevent falls and improve balance?
THEN¿ You are eligible to participate in a novel study that uses state-of-the-art technology to assess benefit of a novel
footwear to improve your mobility , balance and risk of falling . Objectives BCM iCAMP at the Department of surgery has
been partnered with Orthopedic Holing Inc. to test an innovative Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) device for improving balance
and reducing fall risk. If proven ef fective, the technology could help enhance mobility , quality of walking, and promote a
strong and healthy life.
What exactly do I do? W e will provide you with a new pair of New Balance shoes. W e study your walking and balance
patterns throughout a year long period. During this period you will ONL Y be seen [ADDRESS_918803]. 
Why participate? Falls represent an important source of preventable morbidity and mortality in older adults, with one in
three people 65 years and older falling each year; 20% to 30% of those falls result in injuries Due to aging, foot strength
and flexibility are reduced causing increase in risk of falling. Appropriate footwear could reduce risk of falling and enhance
mobility performance. Being safely active could reduce frailty and retain mobility status over time
Equipment
Custom-made Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) easily made to fit into your shoes.
LEGSys (Locomotion Evaluation and Gait System) is a wearable system that allows measurements of gait using sensors
attached to shins, thighs, and lower back.

1.     INTRODUC TION 
 
1.1   SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND  
 
1.1.1 Glioblastoma 
 
Primary CNS tumo rs account for 1.4%  of all cancers and 2.4%  of all cancer-related deaths. 
In 2010,  an estimated 22,020  new cases of primary malignant brain tumo rs will be 
diagnosed and 13,140  patients will die from these tumo rs. Approximately 50%  of all 
primary brain tumo rs originate from astrocytes, one of the subtypes of the nonn euronal 
suppo rtive glial cells of the brain. The second histological type of primary brain tumo rs are 
derived from oligodendrocytes and called oligodendrogliomas. Primary brain tumo rs that 
develop from astrocytes are called astrocytomas. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
classifies astrocytomas into four distin ct grades referred to as Grades I, II, III and IV on the 
basis of how quickly the cells grow and spread and how the cells appear under a microscope. 
Essentially all grade II and III astrocytomas will progress to grade IV during the disease 
course. Gliobl astoma (GBM, Grade IV astrocytoma) is the most  common  and most 
aggressive  of the primary malignant brain tumo rs in adults.  Annually th ere are 
approximately 13,000  cases of GBM diagnosed, with histo rical 1 year and 5 year survival 
rates of 29.3%  and 3.3%[1]. The poor survival is attributable partly to the nature of the 
tumo r. The infiltrative nature of GBM results in difficulty elimin ating microscopic disease 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_607185]-total resection, with 90% of patients having recurrence at the 
original tumor  location[2]. The location of the tumor  also makes drug delivery difficult with 
only sm all or lipophilic  molecules able to cross the blood  brain barrier to reach the tumo r. 
Of those agents that are able to  reach the tumo r, GBMs have shown  to be resistant to most 
cytotoxic agents and to quickly develop resistance when initially sensitive. The most 
significant advance in treatment for GBM over the l ast several years has come from 
concomitant chemoradioth erapy with  temozolamide  which can result in increased median 
survival of 14.6 months  with radioth erapy plus  temozolomide  compared to 12.1 months 
with radioth erapy alone[3]. How ever, this still leaves much to be desired with an 
improvement in median survival of only 2.[ADDRESS_804485] 
shown  that some  benefit can be seen with the topi[INVESTIGATOR_607186]-1 inhibitor  Irinotecan combin ed 
with the angiogenesis inhibitor  Avastin. This combin ation can achieve median progression 
free survivals of 22- 23 weeks, and median overall survivals of 40 to 54 w eeks[4, 5]. 
 
It is well accepted that brain tumo rs rely on  vascularization for survival and continu ed 
growth. While normal brain vasculature is a highly organized structure of endoth elial cells, 
pericytes, and astrocytes forming a  tight barrier which restricts access to the intracerebral 
system, GBMs displ ay markedly diso rganized vascular structures with conspi [INVESTIGATOR_607187], pericyte and basement membrane abnormalities resulting in 
permeability with  heterogenous  leakiness and abnormal blood  flow[6]. This aberrant 
process of endoth elial proliferation and loss of the blood  brain barrier is related to the 
expression  of vascular endoth elial growth  factor (VEG F) by [CONTACT_607222].  This 
leakiness results in an increased interstitial pressure and an impediment to drug delivery. 
By [CONTACT_607223] F-A or 
inhibition  of the VEGF  receptors, it has been shown  that prompt  reduction in interstitial 
Confidential 7 CTRC at UTHSCSA 
Protocol CTRC# 12-0105  March 31, 2017  
  
pressures can be achieved with p resumed better drug delivery to the  tumor  cells. While the 
role of VEGF signaling in angiogenesis has been extensively described, another role for 
VEGF  has been proposed with carcinoma  progression  selecting for cells that depend on 
VEGF  as a survival and migration factor[7]. This would  explain the high frequency of 
VEGF  receptor expression  in GBMs as well as other malignancies [8]. Targeting of VEGF 
has proven to be clinically relevant in recurrent gliobl astoma  as further discussed below. 
Current studi es are addressing the  impact of angiogenic inhibition  upfront in newly 
diagnosed glioblastom a.

These include MDR1 (ABCB1), MRP1 (ABCC1) and BCRP (ABCG2). 
 
Few normal cells ever reach severe hypoxia.  In contrast, tumo rs often consist  of large 
areas of highly hypoxic cells that are known  to be resistant to chemoth erapy and radiation 
treatment [9, 10].   In areas of normoxia, TH-[ADDRESS_804488] rating a “by[CONTACT_112815]” effect and possib ly

1.1.3 No nclinical Studies with TH-302 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] M echanism  of Action 
 
TH-[ADDRESS_804489] of TH-302 in a 3 day proliferation assay with H460  cells was both dose 
and oxygen dependent with a greater than 10-fold increase in cell kill (based on IC50) 
under 0.6%  oxygen levels and a 500-fold increase in the absence of oxygen as compared 
with air (20% oxygen).    In normoxic conditions  the drug levels  necessary to achieve 
cytotoxic effects were well above  those  expected to be achieved in vivo.    A simil ar 
oxygen dependent shift of the effec t of TH-302 on proliferation was observed with HT-29 
cells.   Clonog enic assays also provided simil ar results.  We then tested the hypoxia- 
selective cytotoxicity profile of TH-302 across a wide range of different human cancer cell 
lines (>30).  Every line  examined exhibited a greatly enhanced cytotoxicity when the TH-

302 exposu re under hypoxic conditions  (2h) is compared to the potency observed with a 2h 
exposu re under normoxia.  Of particular note was the finding of  a wide  range of potencies 
that spanned more than two orders of magnitude  among t he different individual cell lines 
examined (0.1 µM – 88µM). 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hum an Tumor  Xenograft Studies 
 
TH-302 antitumor  activity  as monoth erapy was dose-dependent and correlated with total 
drug exposu re.  Correlation was found  between antitumor  activity and tumor  hypoxic 
fraction across the twelve xenograft models profiled. Tumo r-bearing animals breathing  
95% O2 during dosing p eriods exhibited attenuated TH-302 efficacy, with while  those 
breathing 10%  O2 exhibited enhanced TH-302 efficacy, both compared to normoxia (21% 
O2) breathing.  TH-302 treatment results in a reduction in the volume  of the hypoxic 
fraction 48 hr after dosing and a correspondi ng increase in the necrotic fraction. TH-302 
induced DNA  damage as measured by γH2AX  was initially only present in the hypoxic 
regions and th en radiated to the  entire tumor  in a time-dependent manner. 
 
To identify the optim al dosing  regimen for in vivo anti-tumor  efficacy of TH-302 in the 
H460  model, we performed a study employing different dosing regimens of TH-302 in 
combin ation with docetaxel.  Tumo r-bearing mi ce were treated ip with TH-302 according 
to three different regimens: 50mg/kg QDx5/wk  x2wk;  100m g/kg Q3D x5; and 150m g/kg 
Q7D x2. TH-302 monot herapy, tumor  growth  was inhibit ed 89%, 89% and 94% and the 
TGD 500 compared to vehicle control were 18, 16 and 16 days, with these three regimens 
respectively.  TH-302 monoth erapy did not show  significant bo dy weight loss.  
 
The antitumor  activity of TH-302 was investigated in combin ation with seven common ly 
used chemoth erapeutics (docetaxel, cisplatin, p emetrexed, irinotecan, do xorubicin, 
gemcitabine and temozolomid e) in nine human tumor  xenograft models, including H460 
and Calu6 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), HT29  colon cancer, PC3 prostate cancer, 
HT1080  fibrosarcoma, A375 and Stew2 melanoma, and Hs766t,  MiaPaCa-2, BxPC-3, and 
SU.86.[ADDRESS_804490] orthotopic  model, TH-302 was studi ed in nude  mice with 
red-fluorescent protein  (RFP)  expressing  MIA PaCa-2  tumo rs  that  were  surgically 
implanted on  the surface of the pancreas under anesthesia[11].    After three days the 
mice were randomi zed into groups  of 8 and were treated with vehicle; TH-302 at 30 mg/kg, 
IP (intraperitoneal), once a day for 5 days repeated for a total of 11 doses over 15 days; 
gemcitabine IV at 200 m g/kg once a week for three doses over 15 days; or the combin ation 
of the two drugs.  Monoth erapy with TH-302 provided minor  reductions  in tumor  growth  
Confidential 9 CTRC at UTHSCSA 
Protocol CTRC# 12-0105  March 31, 2017  
  
whereas gemcitabine alone significantly inhibit ed tumor  growth and increased survival 
significantly.   The combination of TH-302 and gemcitabine provided greatly enhanced 
reduction in tumor  volum e.   In addition,  this combin ation provided greater survival than 
gemcitabine alone.    In the second orthotopic  model, TH-302 was studi ed in nude  mice 
with   green-fluorescent   protein  (GFP)   expressing   PC-3   prostate tumo rs that were 
surgically implanted on the  surface of the prostate under anesthesia [12]. Three days after 
the  orthotopic  transplantation,  the  mice  were  randomi zed  into groups  of 8 and were 
treated with  vehicle; TH-302 at 30 or 50 mg/kg, IP, once a day for 5 days, repeated for two 
weeks; paclitaxel IV at 12 mg/kg every three days for 4 weeks; or the combin ation of the 
two  drugs  at  both  doses  of  TH-302.     Paclitaxel  significantly reduced mean  tumor 
volume  and significantly improved survival. There was a delay in tumor  growth  in the 
group treated only with TH-302 at either 30 or 50 mg/kg.  How ever, all tumors did begin 
to grow later in the study, particularly after the end of treatment. The greatest reductions 
in  tumor  volume  occurred  in  groups  treated  with  both  agents regardless of TH-302 
dose. In these groups  5/8 mice (30 mg/kg) and 3/8 mice (50 mg/kg) had compl ete 
respons es in the prostate tumo r. Open body images collected at the end of the study 
confirmed  the  absence of  fluorescent signal for four  of these mice in the 30 mg/kg 
group and all three mice in the 50 mg/kg g roup.

chemoth erapeutics.  A PC-3/luc  intracar diac injection model was performed to evaluate 
the efficacy of TH-[ADDRESS_804492] ed of vehicle, docetaxel alone 
(20 mg/kg once a week for 3 weeks, IV), TH-302 alone (50 mg/kg daily IP, 5 days a 
week for 3 weeks) or the combin ation of the two drugs.  In addition  to metastases in the 
mandibl e, fore or hind limbs,  most  mice also developed soft tissue  metastases primarily 
in the liver and lungs.   Mice treated with TH-302 alone had a 95% reduction in bone 
metastases and a 96% reduction in soft tissue  metastases at Day 42.  Mice treated with 
docetaxel alone had a signi ficant reduction in  both bone  and soft tissue  metastases with 3 
of 10 (30%) mice showing a compl ete response  initiating on  Day [ADDRESS_804493] decrease in both bone  and soft tissue 
metastases.  Eight of ten (80%) of mice had a compl ete response  (bone and soft tissue 
metastases).  Toxicities of the combin ation regimen were simil ar to that of the d ocetaxel 
alone group with one animal in each group having a treatment related death.  All eight 
mice in the TH-[ADDRESS_804494] ete responses of the bone metastases and soft tissue  metastases.  A Nd- 
H460  pleural  space  implantation  model  was  performed  to  evaluate  the efficacy  of 
TH-302 alone and in combin ation with docetaxel[13].  Treatments started seven days after 
implantation and consist ed of vehicle, docetaxel alone (10 mg/kg once a week for 2 weeks, 
IV), TH-302 alone (50 mg/kg IP daily, 5 days a week for 2 weeks) or the combin ation of 
the two drugs. Median survival was 24 days for vehicle compared to 42.5  days with TH- 
302, 35 days for docetaxel alone and 56 days with TH-302 in combin ation with docetaxel. 
 
TH-302 has also been tested in ectopic tumor  xenograft models in combin ation with 
clinically approved VEGFR kinase antiangiogenesis agents (sunitinib  and sorafenib). 
Several  publish ed  studi es  have  demonst rated  an  increase  in  tumor  hypoxia  after 
Confidential 10 CTRC at UTHSCSA 
Protocol CTRC# 12-[ADDRESS_804495] ration of anti-angiogenesis agents that target VEGF signaling (e.g. sunitinib, 
sorafenib, bevacizumab). To characterize sunitin ib-induced effects on tumor v asculature 
and tumor hypoxia, 786-O (RCC ) and H460  (NSCLC) hum an ectopic t umor xenografts 
were treated with sunitinib  (20 or 40 mg/kg) daily for [ADDRESS_804496] [ZIP_CODE]  to label vascular 
perfusion.  The NSCLC model (H460)  exhibits  a baseline hypoxic fraction of 7%. Sunitinib 
induced a dose-dependent increase in tumor  hypoxia volume  (24 ± 3.2%  with 40 mg/kg vs. 
7.3 ± 3.8%  with Vehicle, p<0.05)  and a correspon ding decrease in tumor  microvasculature. 
The 786-O RCC model is a well-vascularized tumor  as characterized by [CONTACT_398]31 and Hoechst 
staining with  a relatively sm all baseline hypoxic compartment (<5% volum e) in the 
xenograft tumo rs. Sunitinib also induced a dos e-dependent increase in  tumor hypoxia 
volume  (17.2 ± 7.1% with  40 mg/kg vs. 1.4 ± 0.9%  with Vehicle, p<0.05)  and a 
correspondi ng decrease in functional vasculature in the RCC model. To test the 
combin ation of TH-302 with sunitinib,  H460  NSCLC tumo r-bearing animals (~150mm3  at 
start of dosing)  were randomi zed into groups  of 10 and treated with sunitinib  at 20, 40, or 
80 mg/kg p.o. daily for 3 weeks (QDx21). After one week of sunitinib  monoth erapy animals 
began combin ation therapy with the addition  of TH-302 at 50 mg/kg i.p. daily for 5 days 
on and 2 days off (QDx5) for [ADDRESS_804497] ered 4 hours before TH-302 
on days when both agents were given. Control arms included all 3 doses of sunitinib 
monoth erapy, TH-302 monoth erapy, and vehicles-only groups.  Sunitinib  exhibited dose- 
dependent antitumor  efficacy (by [CONTACT_607224], TGD,  and condition al survival), as did TH-302 
monoth erapy. All three combin ation therapy treatment groups  exhibited superior efficacy 
compared to the corresponding  monoth erapy groups. A similarly designed experiment was 
performed in the RCC (786-O) mod el with sunitinib and the H460  NSCLC and A375 
melanoma mod els with sorafenib, and simil ar results were obt ained of TH-302 addition 
potentiating the  antiangiogenic antitumor  effects. The results suppo rt the hypothesis that 
the hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 may be an effec tive addition  to antiangiogenic- 
containing chemoth erapy regimens.

leukop enia and neutropenia were evident, particularly at the high dose level where 
hypocellularity was also reported in the bone  marrow.  These changes were reversible. 
There was no sign of vein irritation in either species tested and exposu re of human blood

weekly for 3 weeks of an every 4 week cycle (Arm A) was initiated at a weekly dose of 
7.5 m g/m2 and the maximum tol erated dose (MTD) was establish ed at 575 mg/m2.  Based 
on the toxicology  studi es, hematologic toxicity was expected to be the major dose-limiting 
adverse reaction of TH-302; however, hematologic toxicity has rarely been significant and 
dose-limiting to xicities were mucosal and skin toxicity.  Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
of perianal and rectal ulcers and oral mucositis  with associated dehydration were observed 
at 670 mg/m2.  Comm on adverse events include nausea, fatigue, vomitin g, constip ation 
and diarrhea.   Skin toxicities including int ertriginous  erythema, desquamation and 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_607188].  At TH-302 doses above  240 mg/m2, prophylaxis against nausea and 
vomiting  should  be implemented using  a regimen intended for moderately emetogenic 
chemoth erapy.  During the dose escalation, anti-tumor  activity was observed in subjects 
with malignant melanoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Based on these data, a dose expansion  cohort was opened at 575 mg/m2 to enroll

dose, a dose expansion  cohort was opened at 480 mg/m2 to obtain safety and tolerability 
data and to obtain efficacy data in subjects with malignant melanoma, SCLC, 
hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and tumo rs with squamous  or transition al cell histolo gies 
based on anti-tumor  activity observed in TH-302 monoth erapy and/or  combination therapy 
in these indications.  A separate treatment arm (Arm B) was opened to determine  the MTD, 
DLTs, safety and prelimin ary anti-tumor  activity utilizing a once every 3 week dosing 
regimen of TH-302.  The Arm B dose was escalated from 670 mg/m2 to 940 mg/m2 and 
the MTD w as establish ed at 670 m g/m2.

in combin ation with 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed was 480 mg/m2. DLTs at higher TH-302 doses 
were Grade 3 stom atitis and G rade 4 thrombocytopenia. 
 
TH-CR-403 is a Phase 1/2, multi  center, dose escalation study to determine the safety, 
efficacy and PK of TH-302 in combin ation with full-dose doxorubicin in subjects with soft

of TH-302 and 75  mg/m2 doxorubicin with prophylactic growth  factor support. DLTs at a 
TH-302 dose of 340 mg/m2 were Grade 4 thrombo cytopenia and Grade 3 infection with 
Grade 4 neutropenia.  Enrollment was expanded at the MTD for subjects with advanced 
soft tissue  sarcoma previously untreated with chemoth erapy (neoadjuvant and adjuvant 
chemoth erapy permitted).  Tumor  response  data were available for [ADDRESS_804507] response rates were: partial response (18 of 54, 33%), stable dis ease 
(28 of 54, 52%) and progressive  disease (8 of 54, 15%).  The median progression -free 
survival was 6.4 months (95% CI: 5.6 months  to 6.9 months ).  The 6-month  progression - 
free rate was 56%  and the 3-month p rogression -free 
 
rate was 83%. The median overall survival had not been reached. The tumor response  and 
stable dis ease rates and progression -free survival were all higher than those reported with 
single-agent doxorubicin.  The combin ation regimen was well tolerated with acceptable

Study TH-CR-404 is an open-label multi -center randomi zed controlled crossov er Phase 2 
study of two dose levels of TH-302 (240 and 340 mg/m2) in combin ation with gemcitabine 
versus gemcitabine alone in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A total of 165 subjects are planned to be enrolled at a ratio of 
1:1:1.  Subjects on the  gemcitabine arm who dis continue  for disease progression and m eet 
laboratory, tumor  and performance status eligibility criteria may crossov er to TH-302 plus 
gemcitabine at a random ized TH -302 dose  of 240 mg/m2 or 340 m g/m2.  TH -302 dos es of 
240 mg/m2 or 340 mg/m2 are administ ered IV over 30 minut es on Days 1, 8 and 15 of every 
28-day cycle.  The dose of gemcitabine is 1,000  mg/m2 administ ered IV over [ADDRESS_804508] ered as a 30 -minute 
intravenous  infusion  daily for 5 days every 21 days.   The starting dose is 120 mg/m2. 
Subjects who successfully compl ete a 3-week treatment cycle without evidence of 
significant treatment-related toxicity or clinically significant progressive  disease continue 
to receive treatment for up to six cycles.  Enrollment in the study was initiated in June of 
2010.  
 
Study CTRC 11-24 (IND 112417)  is a phase 1 dose escalation study in glioblastom a, with 
patients who were administered TH302  at a sin gle preoperative dose of 5 75 mg/m2. Once 
recovery from surgery was observed, patients received bevacizumab at the standard dose 
of 10mg/kg and TH302  at 240, 340, 480, or 670mg/m2 given together in a Q2w eek 
schedule. In the final cohort of 670  mg/m2, the surgical requirement was elimin ated and 
patients were allowed to go directly to combin ation therapy with bevacizumab. No patients 
experienced a dose limiting  toxicity within  the first cycle at any dose level. The most 
common to xicity of any grade observed was anal mucositis, whi ch was observed in 2 of 4 
(50%) patients in the  480mg/m2 cohort and 4 of  4 (100%) patients at 670 mg/m2. The  anal 
mucositis  can be controlled with suppo rtive care (see Appendix D). As 670 mg/m2 has 
already been documented as  the MTD  when given every three weeks in single agent 
studi es, no further dose escalation is planned.  The ph ase 2 dose in  combin ation with 
bevacizumab every 2 weeks is therefore 670 mg/m2. While efficacy was not a primary 
endpoint  of this  study, two partial respons es have b een observed and [ADDRESS_804509] rating stable disease, for a combin ed clinical benefit rate of 58% (n=12; with 2 not 
yet evaluable). Further, one patient has reached cycle 24 (day 640) and continu es with 
stable disease. These observations  sugg est potential clinical activity of  TH-[ADDRESS_804510]- 
line therapy. Currently, front-line treatment consists of a multi -modality approach that 
Confidential 14 CTRC at UTHSCSA 
Protocol CTRC# 12-0105  March 31, 2017  
  
includes maximal surgical resection, adjuvant radiation therapy w ith concurrent 
temozolomide  at 75 mg/m2 follow ed by 6 mont hs of single-agent temozolomide  at up to 
200 mg/m2. Temozolomide (a prodrug) is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_607190]-enzymatically converted to the 
active alkylating m etabolite MTIC [(methyl-triazene-1-yl) – imidazole-4-carboxamide]. 
The cytotoxic effects of MTIC are manifested through alkylation of DNA at the O6,  N7 
guanine positions.  
 
This multimod al approach has been the st andard of care ever since the p ublication of the 
landmark EORTC phase III trial publish ed by [CONTACT_607225] [ADDRESS_804511] study to date was a phase II, 
multi center, open-label, noncomparative trial conducted by [CONTACT_607226] 2009  which 
evaluated the efficacy of bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks), alone and in combin ation 
with irinotecan (125 mg/m2 in those  non receiving enzyme-inducing anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_607191] 340 mg/m2 in those  who were taking these drugs), in patients with recurrent 
glioblastom a. In the bevacizumab-alone and the bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan groups, 
estimated 6-month  progression -free survival rates were 42.6%  and 50.3%, respectively; 
objective respon se rates were 28.2% and 37.8%, respectively; and median overall survival 
times were 9.2  months  and 8.7 months,  respectively. Nonetheless, these are all improved 
outcomes when compared to histo rical data in the  recurrent setting. 
 
Dose  limiting  toxicities of bevacizumab are hypertension,  proteinuria, thrombo embolic 
events, spont aneous bleeding and wound  healing compli cations.  In the phase II stu dy 
condu cted by [CONTACT_37062], bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab plus irinotecan, 46.4%  and 
65.8%, respectively, experienced grade >or = [ADDRESS_804512]  common of which 
were hypertension  (8.3%) and convulsion  (6.0%) in the b evacizumab-alone group and 
convulsion  (13.9%), neutropenia (8.9%), and fatigue (8.9%) in the bevacizumab-plus- 
irinotecan group. Intracranial hemorrhage was noted in two patients (2.4%) in the 
bevacizumab-alone group (grade 1) and in three patients (3.8%) patients in the 
bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan group (grades 1, 2, and 4, respectively). Bevacizumab 
obtained accelerated FDA-approval in 2009  for patients with recurrent glioblastoma 
multi forme.

Protocol CTRC# 12-0105  March 31, 2017  
  
Hypoxia promot es more aggressive tumor ph enotypes and has been associated with 
resistance to radiation and chemoth erapi[INVESTIGATOR_428583], as well as tumor  invasion and poor 
patient survival. In particular, cells at pO2 <[ADDRESS_804513] the potential to be non-invasively imaged using magnetic resonance 
spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Addition al metabolic  biom arkers of hypoxia have been 
investigated in various tumor  types. Jiang and colleagues reported increased levels of 
cholin e-containing metabolites and lipid CH3  colocalizing with the hypoxic areas of the 
tumor in  a breast cancer mod el[14]. High resolution  methods  based on either MR 
spectroscopy or mass spectrometry platforms are also of value to obtain a detailed metabolic 
signature [CONTACT_607251] [15, 1 6]. 
 
1.1.7  Ris ks and Benefits 
 
Phase I dose-escalation clinical studi es involving TH-302 in combin ation with other 
cytotoxic agents (gemcitabine, docetaxel) have demonst rated dose limiting to xicities to be 
most ly hematological and dermatological. The MTD  was 340 mg/m2  when administ ered 
with gemcitabine and docetaxel. How ever, TH-[ADDRESS_804514] dose-limiting  toxicities were reported at weekly doses of 670 mg/m2  and these 
were related to mu cosal toxicities and not h ematological. 
 
It is impo rtant to note th at TH-[ADDRESS_804515] etion of th erapy. Other pot ential sites of organ injury, include kidn ey, 
liver and GI function. The active metabolite  of TH-302, Br-IPM, is an alkylating agent

two weeks. Overall, this drug has been well tolerated. How ever, dose limiting  toxicities that 
have been consist ently reported include hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic  events, 
spont aneous bl eeding and wound h ealing compli cations.  
 
The risk-to-benefit ratio is consid ered acceptable for both  drugs to be us ed in this phase II 
clinical study based upon  the patient popul ation, the limit ed numb er of active agents for this

glioblastoma with  a direct effect on vessel permeability. This direct vessel effect makes it 
difficult to interpret changes in contrast enhancement seen on brain MRI and assess whether 
these changes correlate with tumor  burden after receiving bevacizumab. In many patients 
who recur after bevacizumab therapy, progression  is manifest as a diffuse infiltrative pattern 
without  worsening enhancement, resembling gliomatosis cerebri. Using a hum an GBM 
model in rats via  xenografted tumo rs, Keunen et al, reported that anti-angiogenic treatment 
leads to loss of large-sized vessels resulting in reduced perfusion,  blood  volume  and increase 
in hypoxia in the tumor  microenvironment[16]. This increase in hypoxia leads to an increase 
in lactate production, stabilization of HIF-[ADDRESS_804518] rated that this drug is highly active in in vitro proliferation

In our Phase [ADDRESS_804520] ered TH302  at a single preoperative dose of 575 mg/m2.  Once recovery from 
surgery was observed, they received bevacizumab at the standard dose of 10mg/kg and 
TH302  at 240, 340, 480, and 670 mg/m2 given together in a Q2week schedule. In the final 
cohort of 670 m g/m2, the surgical requirement was elimin ated and patients were allowed to 
go directly to combin ation th erapy with b evacizumab. 
 
No patients experienced a dose limiting  toxicity within  the first cycle at any dose level. 
Further, 670 mg/m2 has already been documented as the MTD  when given every three weeks 
in single agent studi es. Therefore, based upon  the lack of DLT in our Phase 1, the Phase 2 
dose in combin ation with b evacizumab every 2 weeks is 670 m g/m2.

1.5 Ra tionale for in vivo Positron Emission  Tomography Studies of Tumor Hypoxia 
In order to generate in vivo measurements of hypoxia, subjects will be asked to participate 
in 18F-Fluoromisonid azole (FMISO) PET scans, which have been used safely numerous 
times in humans since the 1980 ’s [17]. FMISO is a nitromid azole family derivative, 
analogous to TH-302, which diffuses into cells and un dergoes reduction in a  hypoxic 
environment. This compound  has also been used before to successfully image hypoxia in 
Grade IV astrocytomas [18,19 ]. Images will be  corrected to background  attenuation. The 
estimated average dose of 18F-FMISO subjects will receive per scan is 250-300 MBq (range 
from 120-450 MBq). The scan will be initiated approximately 110-[ADDRESS_804522] 18F- 
Confidential 18 CTRC at UTHSCSA 
Protocol CTRC# 12-[ADDRESS_804523] ration, and plasma pharmacokinetic samples (1mL) will be collected to 
assess decay of 18F-FMISO.

3.1.1 I nvestigational Sites 
This study is a multi -center, single arm, two stage, open label trial. The only participating 
sites will be the CTRC @ UTH SCSA and Dana Farber Cancer Center. CTRC@UTH SCSA 
will implement ongoing monito ring activiti es to ensure that Participating Institutions  are 
complying with  regulatory and protocol requirements, data quality, and participant safety. 
Monito ring will  occur before the clinical phase of the protocol begins, continue  during 
protocol performance and through study compl etion. Addition al monito ring practices may 
include but  are not  limit ed to; source verification of case report forms, review and analysis 
of the followin g: eligibility requirements of all participants , informed consent procedures,

3.1.2 Statistics 
[IP_ADDRESS] Sample size justification 
Subjects will be assessed on Day 1 of each 6 week cycle by [CONTACT_607227][18] and as described below. This study will  include up to 33 
experimental subjects (plus an undetermined numb er of subjects rolling  over from Protocol 
CTRC# 11-24) with  an accrual interval of 12  months.  There will  be an addition al follow 
up period of 12 months.  Based on histo rical data, the median progression  free survival of 
54 patients on control salvage therapy was 37.5 days (Quant et al 2008 ). If the true median 
progression -free survival in the histo rical control group and the experimental treatment 
group treated at the M TD are 37.5  days and 67 days, then assuming  a one-parameter 
exponential model, the correspondi ng mean times to progression  are 54.1 [=37.5/lo g(2)] 
and 96.7 [=67/log(2)] days, and the  proportion p rogression -free at 4 months is estimated 
to be 0.289  in the experimental group and 0.109  in the histo rical control group. With one- 
sample  2-stage testing and alpha=0.05 and 80% power, the optim al 2-stage design will

severity,  and  causality of an  AE  b ased  on  the  following  definitions.  
 
7.2.1   D efining Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable event occurring to or in a subject enrolled in a 
clinical trial, whether or not the event is consid ered related to the study drugs (TH-302, 
bevacizumab).  This includes the time periods beginning after the  first  administ ration  of 
study drug until  [ADDRESS_804565]  dose  of study drug. 
Adverse events in clude the following  types of occurrences: 
1) Suspected adverse reactions;  
2)  Other  medical  experiences, regardless  of  their  relationship to  the  study  drug, such 
as injury, causes for surgery, accidents, increased severity of pre-existing symptoms, 
apparently  unrelated  illnesses,  and  significant   abnormalities  in clinical    laboratory 
values,  physiological  testing,   or physical   examination findin gs; and 
3) Reactions from d rug overdose, abuse, withd rawal, sensitivi ty, or toxicity. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse' experience that occurs at any dose and 
results in any of the following  outcomes. 
 
1)  Death. This includes any death that occurs during the conduct of the  clinical study, 
including  deaths that appear to be compl etely unrelated to the study drug (e.g., car accident). 
How ever, deaths that occur due to disease progression are not consid ered SAEs,  but should 
be reported as a death on  study.   If  a subject  dies  during the study,  and  an  autopsy is 
performed, the autopsy results should  be sent to Threshold.  Possible  evidence of organ 
toxicity  and  the  potential  relationship  of  the  toxicity  to  the  study  drug  are  of 
particular  interest.   The autopsy   report   should   distin guish between the   relationship 
between   the  underlying dis eases, their side effects, and the  cause of death. 
 
2)  Life-threatening adverse experience. This includes any AE  during which the subject 
is, in the vi ew of the in vestigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it  occurs. 
This definition  does not include any event that may have caused death if it had occurred in 
a more severe form. 
 
3) Persistent or significant dis ability or incapacity 
 
4)  Inpatient hospit alization or  prolong ation of  existing  hospit alization 
 
5) Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
Confidential 32 CTRC at UTHSCSA 
Protocol CTRC# 12-0105  March 31, 2017  
  
6) Other medically impo rtant event which, according to appropriate medical judgment, 
may  require  medical  or  surgical intervention  to  prevent  one  of the outcomes listed 
above. 
 
7) Pregnancy occurring in subjects treated with TH-302 should  be reported using  the serious 
adverse event reporting form. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   No nserious adverse events 
A nons erious AE in cludes any AE th at is not d efined as an SAE. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] U nexpected adverse events 
An un expected AE is any AE th at is not id entified in nature, severity or frequency. 
 
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_804566] all AEs as descriptive  findin gs (sympto ms, or  laboratory, physical exam, or vitals 
abnormalities) or diagnoses if etiology is known.  Included are all AEs that occur after the 
start of treatment or within  [ADDRESS_804567] 
AEs of  any severity and AEs th at are assessed as serious or  not s erious.  
 
Note: Unchanged, chronic conditions  and cancer symptoms  present at baseline are NOT 
AEs and should  not be recorded unless there is an exacerbation or   worsening   in 
severity of a chronic condition  or cancer symptom  after the first administration of 
study  drug  until  [ADDRESS_804568]  dose  of  study  drug.  Chronic conditions 
and/or   cancer   symptoms   that   exacerbate   or   worsen   in   severity   should   be 
documented  as  a  "worsening"   condition.    Death  due  to  disease progression  and 
measures  of  disease  progression  collected  as  efficacy  endpoints  (eg increasing 
tumor  size or new lesions) are not considered adverse events, but should be  collected 
as termination reasons (if applicable) and/or not ed in tumor assessment appropriate. 
Other reasons for death occurring during the  AE reporting period are SAEs and should 
be reported as such. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Grading of Adverse Events 
 
Severity of  AEs or clinically significant laboratory test results will be assessed in 
accordance  with  the  grading  scale  presented  in  the  Common  Toxicity  Criteria  for 
Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  version  4.03.  A  copy  of  this  document  can  be  found  at 
the following   internet   site:   http:// evs.nci.nih.gov/ ftp1/CTCAE/About. html.    Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory results and lab results requiring an intervention  will be 
recorded as AEs and should describe whether the lab result was increased or decreased. 
The following  definitions  for rating severity of AEs will be used for events not covered in

[IP_ADDRESS] R elationship to Study Drug 
Using  the  following  criteria,  investigators  will  assess  whether  there  is  a  reasonable 
possibili ty that the study drugs (TH-302, bevacizumab) caused or contributed to the  AE. 
 
Yes 
The  time  sequence  between  the  onset  of  the  AE  and  study  drug  administ ration  is 
consist ent with the event being related to study drug; and/or  There is a possible  biolo gic 
mechanism  for study drug causing or contributing to the AE; and the AE may or may not 
be attributed to concurrent/und erlying illness, oth er drugs, or procedures. 
 
No 
Anoth er cause of the AE is most  likely; and/or  the  time  sequence  between  the  onset  of 
the  AE  and  study  drug  administ ration  is inconsist ent with a causal relationship;  and/or 
a causal relationship is consid ered biolo gically unlikely. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] A bnormal Laboratory Test Results as A dverse Events 
The  investigator  will  monitor  the  laboratory  test  results  and  determine  the  clinical 
significance of any result that falls outside  of the reference range.  In accordance with good 
medical practice, any clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results must  be follow ed 
until resolved or stabilized. Abno rmal laboratory test results should  not be reported as AEs 
unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_144457], the results constitute  or are associated with a 
clinically relevant condition or  require intervention. 
 
In the event of unexplained, clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results,  the tests 
should  be repeated immediately and follow ed up until the values have returned to within 
the reference range or to baseline for that subj ect. 
 
7.2.3 R eporting and Documenting Serious Adverse Events 
Serious adverse events (SAE) that occur at any time point  after the first dose of study drug 
until [ADDRESS_804569]  be reported as 
per institution al poli cy and as required under the Data Safety Monito ring Plan (see Section 
10.6 for DSMP).  Contact [CONTACT_607235]@UTH SCSA will be 
provided to each stu dy site. 
 
Submit  all known  subject information (listed below) within  24 hours of knowledge of the

SAE occurrence. The following in formation should  also be entered in the database (or as 
much as possible  to obt ain and still report the event within 24 hou rs): 
 
a)  Subject's Demographic Data 
b)  Subject's weight 
c)  Description of  SAE, in cluding  date of onset and duration, s everity, and outcome 
 
d) All  dosing  data of study drugs  administ ered  up  to  the  date the SAE occurred 
e) Action t aken regarding study drug administ ration 
f)  Relationship of  SAE to stu dy drugs 
 
g) Concomitant medications, in cluding  regimen and indi cation 
 
h)  Intervention, in cluding concomitant medications us ed to t reat SAE 
 
i)  Pertinent laboratory data and di agnostic  tests condu cted and date 
j) Pertinent medical histo ry of subject 
k) Date of hospit al admission dis charge (if applicable) 
 
l)  Date of death (if applicable) 
 
2) Perform appropriate diagnostic  tests and therapeutic measures, and submit all follow -up 
subst antiating data, such as diagnostic  test reports and autopsy report to the  study PI. 
 
3) Condu ct appropriate consult ation and follow -up evaluations  until the events are resolved, 
stabilized, or otherwise explained by [CONTACT_458]. 
 
4)  Review  each  SAE  report  and  evaluate  the  relationship  of  the  SAE  to  study 
treatment and to the underlying disease.  The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_607199] n ature. 
 
 
5)  Based on a cooperative assessment of the SAE between the treating physician and the 
study PI, a decision  for any further action will be made.   The primary consid eration is 
subject safety.  If the discovery of a new SAE related to the study drug raises concern over 
the safety of its contin ued administ ration to subjects, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_607200] t ake immediate steps to noti fy the FDA. 
6)  The investigator must  report all SAEs and unexpected problems prompt ly to his or her 
IRB/IEC,  as appropriate  (see  ICH  Gui delines, Good  Clinical  Practice [E6]). 
Other actions regarding SAEs mi ght include the followin g: 
a)  Protocol amendment

8.       R EMOVING  SUBJECTS FROM  THE STUDY  
 
8.1     C riteria for Termination 
Subjects are  free  to  discontinue  (withd raw)  at  any time  during  this  clinical  trial.  If a 
subject withd raws from participation in the study du ring the  treatment period, he or she 
should  be encouraged to return for an early termination visit for evaluation of safety (see 
Section 5.4.1, Study Termination/E arly Study Termination). 
 
The investigator has the right to discontinue  any subject from study drug administ ration or 
study participation.   Reasons for subject discontinu ation may include, but are not limit ed 
to, the  followin g: 
 
a)  Clinically significant deterioration of  the subject’s condition;  
 
b)  Disease  progression;  
 
c)  Requirement for other anti-tumor  therapy during the study; 
 
d)  Noncompli ance; 
 
e)  Pregnancy; 
 
f) Significant AE;  
 
g)  Subject's  right  to  withd raw  from  the  study  at  any  time,  with  or  without 
stated reason; 
Confidential 36 CTRC at UTHSCSA 
Protocol CTRC# 12-0105  March 31, 2017  
  
h)  Significant protocol viol ation; 
 
i) Lost to follow -up; 
 
j) Death; 
 
Any other reason that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_607201], would  justify the removal 
of a subject from the  study. 
 
The primary consideration in any determination to discontinue  a subject’s participation must 
be the health and welfare of the subject. 
 
All subjects will be instructed on the impo rtance of complying with the requirements of the 
study. It is expected that subj ects will compl ete all of the necessary visits.  If a subject does 
not    return   for   follow-up   visits   as   directed   or   does   not   adhere   to   the   study 
requirements,  the  investigator will d etermine  if early withd rawal should o ccur.

continu ation of  the study is appropriate scientifically and ethically.  An additional layer 
of review is p rovided by [CONTACT_607242] (DSMC) who 
will review the  DSMB’s reports. 
 
Baseline events and adverse events will be  captured using  the CTRC Master Adverse 
Events Do cument for each patient using  CTCAE V4.03 for the grading and attribution of 
adverse events. Us age of the CTRC Master Adverse Events Do cument centrally 
documents: 
 
• the event and grades the seriousn ess of the event, 
 
• if the event was a change from b aseline, 
 
• the determination of  the relationship b etween the  event and stu dy intervention, 
 
• if the event was part of the normal disease process, and 
 
• what actions w ere taken as a result of  the event. 
 
 
Safety Definitions 
For this stu dy, the following  safety definitions will be  applicable: 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untow ard or unfavorable medical occurrence in 
a human subj ect, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or  disease, temporally associated with the  subject’s 
participation in the  research, whether or not considered related to the  subject’s 
participation in the  research  For this stu dy, all adverse events will be  documented 
starting after the first dose  of study drug and ending  [ADDRESS_804583] dose of study 
drug is received. 
 
Serious Adverse Event 
 
Any adverse event that: 
 
1. results in d eath; 
 
2. is li fe-threatening (places the subject at imm ediate risk of  death from the  event as it 
occurred); 
 
 
3. results in inp atient hospit alization or  prolongation of  existing  hospit alization; 
 
4. results in a  persistent or significant dis ability/incapacity; 
 
5. results in a  congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 
6. based upon  appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and 
may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in this d efinition  
Confidential 41 CTRC at UTHSCSA 
Protocol CTRC# 12-0105  March 31, 2017  
 Unanticipated Problems Involving  Risks to Subjects or Others Definition  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]): 
Unanticipated problem involving  risk to subj ects or others includes any incident, 
experience or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
 
A.  unexpected (in terms of  nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the  protocol-related documents, su ch as the IRB- 
approved research protocol and in formed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject popul ation b eing studi ed (note: the unfound ed 
classification of  a serious adverse event as “anticipated” constitut es serious non- 
compli ance); 
 
B.  definitely related or probably related to p articipation in the  research; and 
 
C.  suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economi c, or social harm) th an was previous ly known  or 
recognized 
 
11.2 R eporting Requirements 
 
For this study, the Master Adverse Events Documents collected on patients for this protocol 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_607204] 
a month ly basis to determine  if a serious safety problem has emerged that results in a 
change or early termination of  a protocol su ch as: 
•   dose modi fication, 
•   suspending  enrollment due  to safety or efficacy, or 
•   termination of  the study due to a significant change in risks or  benefits. 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_16588]2 with the quarterly findin gs for discussion  and review 
during their quarterly meetings. 
 
Specific areas of concern that will be reported to the DSMB2 regarding this study that 
would qu alify as an endpoint are: 
 
 
• evidence from interim evaluation suggesting  TH302 would  have no therapeutic benefit 
to patients on stu dy 
• unacceptable  toxicity  that  would  prevent  patients  from  receiving  treatment  and 
therefore benefit 
 
As per the CTRC DSMP, any protocol modi fications,  problematic safety reports, 
unanticipated problems, and suspension  or early termination of a trial must  be reported to 
the DSMB2 and all members of the research team. Furthermore, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_607205], the UTH SCSA IRB, the CTRC DSMC, and the FDA 
via a FDA Form 3500A  written IND safety report of any adverse events that are either 
serious and/or  unexpected. 
 
Unanticipated Problem Involving  Risk To Subjects Or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) is defined as: Any 
incident, experience or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
• unexpected  (in  terms  of  nature,  severity,  or  frequency)  given  (a)  the  research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB- 
Confidential 42 CTRC at UTHSCSA 
Protocol CTRC# 12-0105  March 31, 2017  
  
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics 
of the subject popul ation being studi ed 
•   definitely related or probably related to p articipation in the  research; and 
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economi c, or social harm) than was previously known  or 
recognized. 
 
Suspension  and early termination of a trial must also be reported immediately to the 
Director of Quality Assu rance who will prompt ly noti fy the  CTRC DSMC, FDA, all 
participating study sites, and the  UTH SCSA IRB. 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_607206] d etermine  the significance of 
the reported events and will provide  findin gs using the  Investigator Initiated Study 
Quarterly DSMC Report Form on a quarterly basis with the DSMB2.  The DSMB2 will 
review the information provided by [CONTACT_32816] [INVESTIGATOR_607207] a quarterly 
basis unless an emergent issue h as been identified. The Investigator Initiated Study 
Quarterly DSMC Report Form includes information on adverse events, current dose levels, 
numb er of patients enrolled, significant toxicities per the protocol, patient status (morbidity 
and mortality) dose adjustments with observed respons e, and any interim findin gs.  Any 
trend consisting of  three or more of the same event will be reported to the CTRC DSMB 
for independent review outside  of the quarterly reporting cycle, which begins three months 
after the first subject is enrolled. The DSMB2 will also provide  its findin gs to the CTRC’s 
Regulatory Affairs Division  so that it may be provided to the UTH SCSA IRB with the 
protocol’s annual progress report. Conflict of interest is avoided by [CONTACT_607243]2, CTRC DSMC and by [CONTACT_607244][INVESTIGATOR_9961]’s by [CONTACT_607245]. 
 
All SAE and UPRISO’s will be reported follow ing CTRC, UTH SCSA institution al and 
FDA guidelines.

emanate from monito ring activiti es.   Protocol compliance, data accuracy and reporting of 
events is further ensured by [CONTACT_607246], whose 
audit report is shared with the PI, the research team and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_607247]. 
 
CTRC DSMB Membership 
 
The CTRC has two D SMB’s with  a primary set of members specific to the histology  of the 
study consisting  of UTHSCSA faculty and st aff.  This Protocol will uti lize DSMB#2. 
As per NCI guidelines and to elimin ate conflict of int erest (financial, intellectual, 
profession al, or regulatory in nature), the CTRC DSMB specific to this study will  not treat 
patients on this protocol.  Usage of the DSMB specific to the histology  has been created to 
ensure that experts in that histology are represented on the DSMB assembled for this 
protocol, but may be expanded, at the PI’s discretion, to include other members which may 
include: 
 
• Experts in the  fields of  medicine and science that are applicable to the  study (if not 
currently represented on the DSMB), 
 
• Statistical experts, 
 
• Lay representatives, 
 
• Multidis ciplinary representation, from relevant specialties including experts such 
as bio ethicists, biost atisticians and basic scientists, and 
 
• Others who can offer an unbiased assessment of the study progress. 
 
 
 
Addition al or alternate membership of in the DSMB is selected by [CONTACT_16676], in 
conjun ction with the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_291859] p rotocol. 
 
CTRC DSMB Charter and Responsibiliti es 
The CTRC DSMB will p rovide  information on the membership composition,  including 
qualifications and experience to both the  UTHSCSA IRB and CTRC PRC for review.  The 
CTRC DSMB for this study will  act as an independent adviso ry board to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_607213], the U THSCSA IRB and the CTRC 
DSMC.   CTRC DSMB reports will utilize the Investigator Initiated Study DSMC Report 
Form Once the protocol is activated, if not already establish ed elsewhere in the protocol the 
CTRC DSMB will establish and provide: 
 
• procedures for maintaining confidentiality; 
 
• statistical procedures including  monito ring guidelines, which will be used to monitor 
the identified primary, secondary, and safety outcome variables;

In order to assure timely review of data for safety and quality of data, CTRC requires 
participating institutions  to submit participant source documents for review.   Data is 
expected to be  updated in a timely manner to facilitate review. 
 
On-site and/or  remote  monito ring of  case report forms will occur after the first subject is 
enrolled and treated on the protocol.  Addition al monito ring may occur at the request of 
CTRC.  Participating institutions  are required to provide  access to source documents.  All 
source do cuments will be submitt ed to CTRC with  the subj ect’s HIPAA information 
deidentified and only including  the patient’s protocol subject ID numb er assigned at the 
time of patient registration. 
 
 
 
All data submitt ed to CTRC will be monito red for timeliness, accuracy, compli ance with 
protocol and st ate/federal requirements.  Results from monito ring and audits will be  
 
shared with any participating sites and the CTRC PI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a timely manner. Any required 
corrections  or respon ses to audit findin gs are expected to be received back to the CTRC QA 
Division within 30 d ays. 
 
CTRC, as the coordinating site, will distribute  any protocol amendments and IND safety 
reports to the participating institution ’s submission  to their local IRB. Participating 
institutions  are expected to submit  and maintain local IRB approval.   Copi[INVESTIGATOR_607214]’s IRB approval letter, consent documents and any subsequent amendments 
are required to be  on file with CTRC prior to consent of a subject.

simultaneous axial ( horizontal) planes over a transaxial  field of view of 15.[ADDRESS_804588] resolution is 4.1 mm FWHM (full-width at  half maximum), equal to that used in 
the fMRI st udies. Emission scans will be obtained for FMISO (see details in  the following paragraphs). 
Transmission scans will be performed with a rotating [ADDRESS_804589]. Venous access lines will be 
established in  each a rm, one for FMISO injection and the other for blood sampling. A trans mission scan 
will be obtained for 15 min with t he patient in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. Patients will be injected intravenously 
with 3.7 MBq/kg (0.1 mCi/kg) of 18FMISO, maximum 370 MBq (10 mCi). Images will be acquired in three 
dimensional mode with  63 slices covering a 15.5-cm axial field  of view. A single field of view emission 
scan ( 30 min) of the brain with t umor will be obtained approximately [ADDRESS_804590]-injection. During 
emission tomography, four venous blood samples will be collected at intervals of 5 min. Whole blood 
samples of 1 mL each will be counted in a  calibrated well counter. 18FMISO blood activity will be averaged 
and then ex pressed as mCi/mL (or MBq/ml) of decay corrected  to time of injection. Reconstructed  
18FMISO PET images will be scaled to the average venous blood concentration of 18FMISO acti vity to 
produce tumor-to-blood (T/B) values. A three dimensional pi[INVESTIGATOR_607217] T/B calculation will  be 
performed. The number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_607218]  a T/B ratio of ≥1.2, indicating viable hypoxic tissue, will 
be determined and converted to  cubic millimeters to assess  hypoxic volume (HV). This cut-off value of 1.2 
has been used to determine HV in previous studies exploring 18FMISO PET[2-6]. Various T/B ratios will be 
used to determine HV in order to confirm and verify that a T/B ratio of 1.2 is reasonable to determine HV.

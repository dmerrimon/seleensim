A Patient -Centered Strategy For Improving 
Diabetes Prevention In Urban American 
Indians  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
September 15, [ADDRESS_904296], [LOCATION_004] [ZIP_CODE]  
1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
a. Brief Summary  
American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIAN)  have disproportionate rates of obesity and 
diabetes and are more  likely to  suffer from psychosocial stressors than their white 
counterparts. These  stressors  increase obesity risks and are barriers to fully participating in 
lifestyle  interventions.  While lifestyle interventions such as the Diabetes Prevention Program 
have  been  effective among racial/ethnic groups, including American Indians, these  
interventions  have not been studied in primary care or community -based settings and  have 
not addressed barriers pertaining to psychosocial stressors or historical  traumas.  
  
b. Objectives  
Our specific aims are:  
1. To deepen engagement of patient and provider stakeholders to better  understand the patient -
centered perspective on psychosocial issues that  influence progression to diabetes among 
urban AIANs.  
2. To refine, strengthen, and test an enhanced DPP that incorporates  psychosocial support for 
urban AIANs in a RCT (n=204).  
3. To rapi[INVESTIGATOR_669650], and national 
level.  These aims address the priority of  eliminating  health disparities by [CONTACT_669653] a  
marginalized population.  
c. Rationale for Research in Humans  
Human subjects must be used to inform the development of a culturally  appropriate and 
enhanced diabetes prevention program addressing  psychosocial stressors and to evaluate the 
effectiveness of this program  
compared to the standard program.  
2. STUDY PROCEDURES  
a. Procedures  

9/27/[ADDRESS_904297] six months of the study to refine a nd strengthen the intervention 
and study protocol by [CONTACT_669654] g deidentified data from the Indian Health Center and 
using Talking Circles(TCs), Modified Photo  Voice, and Digital Storytelling:  
 
1) We will analyze existing, deidentified pre - and post -intervention data  from the existing IHC 
diabetes prevention program to identify information on  the association between mental health, 
BMI, and other indicators.  
 
2) Talking Circles: A total of five Talking Circles (TCs)  will be conducted with  participants 50 
total participants) who are interested in urban AIAN health  and wellness to gain relevant  
insights. Each talking circle will have up to [ADDRESS_904298] unlimited time. Skilled facilitators will lead participants in a 
process to  set ground rules, share a meal, and participate in guided discussions.  Participants 
will decide if the session will be audio recorded or if an  alternative method to summarize  the key 
points from the session will be  used.  
 
3) Modified Photo  Voice: Ten AIAN community members who participated in  a TC will be invited 
to participate in a [ADDRESS_904299].  Participants will participate in 6 sessions 
(one session per week) use a  digital camera to take photographs and write photo narratives 
pertaining to  health needs and assets in AIAN communities. During photo sharing  sessions, 
participant discussions will be audio recorded and transcribed for  data analysis to unco ver 
relevant themes. Participants will share photos  and findings with stakeholders during a 
Community Action Board  (CAB) meeting so that the CAB can use these findings to develop  
appropriate interventions for the enhanced diabetes prevention program.  
 
4) Digital Storytelling: Ten AIAN community members who participated in a  TC but  did not 
participate in the Modified Photovoice project, will be invited to  participate  in a 3-day digital 
storytelling project. A skilled facilitator will guide participants  throu gh a process of storytelling 
combined with technology and digital media to  create a [ADDRESS_904300] a randomized controlled trial with up to 210  participants  for the 16 
week intervention.  
 
Recruited participants will be screened using a set of entry criteria,  including a BMI  between 30 
and 55, and one criterion for metabolic syndrome (e.g.  triglycerides,  HDL, blood pressure, 
fasting blood glucose). Patients cannot already h ave received  a diagnosis of Type II diabetes 
(among other exclusionary criteria). Potentially  eligible  patients complete a written consent 
process which includes a thorough  presentation of  the study's purpose, procedures, and 
potential risks & benefits.  
 
1) Participants will be referred or self -referred to the study.  
2) Initial Screen (self -report): Conducted either in -person or by [CONTACT_648].  
3) Clinical Screen*: In -person verification of eligibility measurements (ie.  Weight  and lab 
measurements). *The clinical  screen can be skipped if clinical  values <3  months are available 
(ie. weight and lab measurements)  
4) Consent: Written, informed  consent will be obtained  
 
9/27/[ADDRESS_904301], clinical measurements, and  wearing a  pedometer for 7 
days. After all baseline data is collected, the participant is  randomly  assigned to ONE of two 
groups: 1) diabetes prevention program (DPP) or 2)  enhanced  diabetes prevention program 
(DPP+).  
 
There are [ADDRESS_904302] DPP and 102 people in the enhanced  diabetes  prevention 
program to address historical trauma (DPP+). Participants will  complete  3 evaluations during 
the research study: baseline, 5 months  (1 week  following  the conclusion of intervention), 
Participants  enrolled in the last cohorts will not have as many follow -up evaluations as  those  
enrolled in initial cohorts. The evaluations include blood draws, other  measurements  (blood 
pressure, height, weight, and waist circ umference), and a series of  questionnaires. Blood 
samples and other measurements will be collected at  all of  the evaluation visits (baseline, 5 
months, 8 months, 14 months, and 20 months)  after a  more than [ADDRESS_904303] blood samples will  be 20 cc's  (approximately 1.5 tablespoons). Any  samples left over after 
analysis will be  destroyed  when the study is completed. Questionnaires include a series of 
questions  about  their eating patterns, physical activity habits, smoking status, past medical  
history, current medications, use of additional health care resources,  resilience, and  emotional 
status. Questionnaires will be filled out at the clinic visits at  baseline, [ADDRESS_904304] risky through the following means:  
1) The intervention targets improvement of behaviors (diet, exercise, stress  reduction) that can  
help decrease weight; thereby, decreasing the chance  of cardiovascular disease.  
2) The intervention recommendations are based on accepted clinical  guidelines.  
3) The intervention builds on previous trials conducted by [CONTACT_669655].  
c. Use of Deception in the Study : 
Deception will not be used in the research study.  
d. Use of Audio and Video Recordings  
We may use audio recording or video recording for Talking Circles, Modified  Photovoice, Digital 
Storytelling, CAB meetings, and intervention classes for  research purposes to analyze 
transcribed data and for educational purposes  in order to review how the health educators are 
presenting the protocol to  the participants. We may also use audio recording for interviewing  
participants about how they  feel about the health education they receive.  
 
We will also use camera pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] (and accompanying written or audio  narrative) and  video 
footage created by [CONTACT_669656], and  perceptions of  health needs and 
assets in the AIAN commu nity. Audio recordings from  interview  debriefings will be destroyed 
once they have been transcribed. Photos,  videos, and  
accompanying audio from Modified Photo  Voice and Digital Storytelling maybe  used  for 
educational purposes, such as during community pre sentations or  scientific  meetings and 
9/27/[ADDRESS_904305] treatment is being 
withheld. The alternative is not to  participate a nd to individually pursue an exercise program(s), 
work with a  personal trainer, or consult with a dietitian on diet modifications.  
f. Will it be possible to continue the more (most) appropriate therapy for the 
participant(s) after  the conclusion of the study?  
If funding allows, we will continue with the enhanced diabetes prevention  program. However, 
the enhanced components of the program may not  typi[INVESTIGATOR_669651], so  we do not gu arantee it.  
g. Study Endpoint (s) 
Because our primary end point is increased resilience and weight loss for  diabetes prevention, 
we do not expect any adverse events to cause us to  terminate the study early. We plan to 
continue the study for the full [ADDRESS_904306] Experimental and/or Clinical Findings  
AIANs are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes  compared to white 
Americans (8% vs. 18%). Additionally, compared to non - Hispanic whites, AIANs have high 
rates of depression symptoms (e.g.,  sadness some of the time 14% vs. 8%), any illicit drug use 
(18%  vs. 9%),  more than once binge drinking in the last month (32% vs. 17%), reported  "not 
satisfied with life" (10% vs. 5%), 14+ days/month with poor mental  health (18% vs. 11%), and 
serious psychological distress (5.2% vs.  3.1%). AIAN scholars have described  the cumulative 
effects of the hardship s AIANs have experienced over the centuries as historical and  
intergenerational trauma. Although diabetes and historical trauma have  been researched 
separately, very little research exists on the  conceptualization or measurement of trauma as it 
relates to  metabolic outcomes.

4. PARTICIPANT POPULATION  
a. Planned Enrollment  
For Talking Circles:  
i. 10-[ADDRESS_904307] participants based on the following criteria:  
a. self -identified AIAN  
 
For Modified Photovoice Project  
i. 10-15 
9/27/[ADDRESS_904308]  
 
For the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)  
i. Up to [ADDRESS_904309] 1 risk factor for 
metabolic syndrome as the ultimate  goal of the study is to prevent diabetes in AIAN populations.  
b. Age, Gender, and Ethnic Background  
i. Older than 21  
ii. Men and Women  
iii. Self -identified as AIAN  
c. Vulnerable Population s 
We are working with an AIAN population that may include participants who are economically 
disadvantaged. The reason for working with these participants is because diabetes is 
disproportionately prevalent among low -socioeconomic status (SES) and racial/ethnic minority 
populations in the [LOCATION_002] (US), which is why we are trying to improve health care for this 
population  
d. Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Populations  
The study is not including children because the focus of our research is diabetes prevention 
which has a low prevalence among children. Those children with the disease likely nece ssitate 
unique intervention strategies not present in our research.  
e. Stanford Populations  
NA 
f. Healthy Volunteers  
Up to [ADDRESS_904310] udy aims 
to promote healthy lifestyles in people who are at increased risk for diabetes. Other than obesity 
and risk factors for diabetes, the participants should be generally healthy. The volunteers will 
not be exposed to any additional risks or harm.  
g. Recruitment Details  
Timpany Center staff will recruit participants from the center and surrounding community. They 
will advertise and recruit for the study at cultural events. Staff will: 1) utilize clinical records to 
identify  patients who meet the eligibility criteria; 2) meet with clinical providers and ask them to 
refer potentially eligible patients; 3) attend numerous AIAN cultural events such as Pow Wows; 
4) reach out to public schools in San Jose with the highest concentr ation of AIAN children.

chronic pain).  
j. Participation in Multiple Protocols  
Participants will be asked about participation in other studies during the screening proc ess. If 
they are in another study, they will need to gain approval from both study protocol directors to 
remain in both studies. Additionally, they will be asked to inform study researchers if they join 
another study during the duration of their participat ion in this study.  
k. Payments to Participants  
Participants in the RCT will receive payment in form of incentives, such as running shoes and 
farmer’s market vouchers. Individuals will receive a gift card for $20 or equivalent incentive 
valued at $20 and a T -shirt valued at $[ADDRESS_904314] ed over 20 weeks. We anticipate the screening of participants 
will take 1 hour. Active participation in the study will take a minimum of 2 hours a week for 
participation in group sessions and 1.5 hours for each evaluation. Participants may decide to 
9/27/19   Page 8 of 10 make h ealthy lifestyle changes, such as increasing their physical activity levels as a result of 
participating in the study. Finally, we anticipate analysis of participant data will take 3 months.

vi. Physical  well-being : 
Randomization to the usual diabetes prevention program (DPP) could improve physical well -
being while randomization to the enhanced DDP (DPP+) has greater potential to improve 
physical well -being.  
vii. Psych ological  well-being  
Randomization to the usual diabetes prevention program (DPP) could improve physical well -
being while randomization to th e enhanced DDP (DPP+) has greater potential to improve 
psychological well -being.  
viii. Economic well -being  
Randomization to the usual diabetes prevention program (DPP) could improve economic well -
being while randomization to enhanced DDP could improve long -term economic well -being by 
[CONTACT_669657] -related illness.  
ix. Social  well-being   
Randomization to the usual diabetes prevention program (DPP) could improve social wel l-being 
while randomization to enhanced DDP could also improve social well -being. However, 
randomization to both groups could also negatively affect social well -being if someone in the 
participant’s social circle reacts negatively to the participant trying  to make healthy changes.

d. Study Conclusion  
We will terminate the study if regular comparison analysis shows that the study poses harm to 
an intervention group. However, because the study is using behavioral change for weight -loss, 
the chance of termination is remote. In the event of adverse effects, we will have referrals to 
nurse practitioner as well as primary care physicians.

rTMS for the Improvement of Cognitive Function and Other 
Outcomes in TBI  
Informed Consent  
 
Are you participating in other research studies? ___Yes ___No  
PURPOSE OF RESEARCH  
You are invited to par ticipate in a research study to determine if  repetitive Transcranial 
Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for improving cognitive function and 
other outcomes .  You were selected as a possible subject in this study because: 1) you have 
indicated that you have had a traumatic brain injury (TBI) ; and 2) you are a Veteran.   
This study is being done by [CONTACT_138406]. This research study is looking for 
100 participants, including Veterans , Military personnel, and civilians, who experience 
cognitive problems  and other outcomes .   
The primary aim for  this study  is to assess the effe ctiveness of rTMS on improving 
cognitive function.  We will also be assessing whether there are changes to quality of life, 
fatigue and PTSD , headache and pain secondary to improvements in cognition.  
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as 
required by U.S. Law.  This Web site will not include information that can identify you.  At  
most, the Web site will include a summary of the results.  You can search this Web site at any time.  
VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION  
Your  participation in this study is entirely voluntary.  Y our decision  not to participate will not 
have any negative effect on you or your medical care.  You can decide to participate now, but withdraw your consent later and stop being in the study without any loss of benefits or medical care you are entitled to.    
DURATION OF STUDY INVOLVEMENT  
This entire research study is expected to be conducted over  approximately [ADDRESS_157389] -treatment, and 6 months .

PROCEDURES  
Patients who sign this informed consent and meet the study eligibility criteria will be 
enrolled into the study and will be randomized into one of 2 treatment groups:  active “real 
rTMS ” or sham (placebo) rTMS .  Patients who fail screening may be re- screened at a later 
time at the discretion of the P rotocol Director . 
If you choose to participate, Dr. A damson and her research study staff will ask you to 
participate in the activities described below.  All study procedures will be completed by [CONTACT_138407].  This study has 4  phases: screening ( 1 hour telephone 
screen, and 6 hours  on-site screen ), baseline ( 8 hours),  intervention ( 2-6 weeks), and follow -
up post-intervention (9 hours) , and at 6 months  (10 hours) .  
1. SCREENING  PHASE  
If you agree to be in this study, you will complete a number of tests to make sure that 
you are eligible and healthy enough to participate . You will read and sign this informed 
consent form before you begin the screening phase. The on-site screening phase will take 
approximately 6 hours  to complete. It may be done in one day or over several days.  
During the screening phase and before you begin the baseline and intervention phases , 
the following will happen:  
• If you are a woman of childbearing age, a urine sample will be used to test for 
pregnancy. Some parts of this research may have negative effects on a fetus and should not be done during pregnancy. Because of this risk, it is necessary that a pregnancy test be done first, as a positive test would exclude you from participation in this study. Additionally, it is important for you to tell us if , to your knowledge, you are 
pregnant or breast -feeding at the time of this study.  
• You will be given a physical examination. A clinician will assess your medical history, your pain, and also your mood.   
• Study staff will review with you any medications  (prescriptions, “natural food products ,” 
supplements , and “over the counter”  medications ) that you are taking or have taken in 
the past. During the study, you will not be able to take any medications  known to 
increase the risk of seizures. Your primary physician may adjust your medications  as 
needed.  
• You will complete several assessments about your health, cognitive function, your pain, 
your mood,  your use of alcohol and other substances, and any possible traumatic 
experiences you may have had.  
• A blood sample of about [ADDRESS_157390] that is abnormal, you may need to return for additional tests.  They will also be used for

assessment of plasma proteins and genetic information.  Any samples left over after 
analysis will be stored.  
• You will be asked to provide a urine sample. This sample will be screened for the use of 
drugs. Positive results may require that you be excluded from this study. If you are able 
to stop using these drugs, you may be re- screened later.  
• You will have a breathalyzer to measure your  alcohol level. This will be for the 
screening of alcohol use. P ositive results may require that you be excluded from this 
study. If you are able to limit your alcohol consumption per the study guidelines , you 
may be re- screened later.  
• You will be provided with the results of these blood, urine, and breathalyzer  tests , if you 
request them.   
• You will be tested with an rTMS coil in order to find the settings that will be used for your treatments. This is called a “motor threshold” and is the amount of magnetic power 
required to make your right thumb move by [CONTACT_138408]. We will attach pads to your right thumb and hand with non -permanent adhes ive. The pads will be connected 
to a machine which measures the movement in your hand. We will use this machine, called an electromyography or EMG, to find your motor threshold.  
2. BASELINE PHASE  
Upon successful completion of the screening phase, and after  careful review of all labs, 
exams, and assessments to ensure your safety  and suitability for the duration of the study, 
you will complete the baseline phase. The baseline phase will take approximately 8 hours  
to complete. It may be done in one day or over several days.  During the baseline phase , 
the following will happen:  
• You will have a hearing test to measure your level of hearing.  
• You will complete several assessments, as well as a series of cognitive assessments.  
• MRI of your brain will be taken.  
• A blood sample of about 4 tablespoons will be taken and used for assessment of 
plasma proteins.  Any samples left over after analysis will be stored.  
About MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)  
MRI machines use strong magnet and radiofrequency fields to make images of the body 
interior.  The scanning procedure is very much like an X -ray or CT scan.  You will be asked 
to lie on a long narrow couch for approximately one hour  while the machine gathers data.  
During this time you will not be exposed to x -rays, but rather a strong magnetic field and 
radiofrequency magnetic fields, which you will not feel.  You will, however, hear repetitive tappi[INVESTIGATOR_138378] (MR) scanner.  We will provide earplugs or headphones that you will be required to wear.  The space within the large

Tissue Sampling for Genetic Testing  
Genetic tests will be conducted on your samples.   The tests we plan to do will allow us to 
study potential predisposition to metabolic, neurological, or immunological dis ease and 
responses to the treatment  offered as an intervention in this study. Research using blood or 
tissues is an important way to try to understand traumatic brain injury and/or the role genes play in the health problems associated with traumatic brain injury.  
Sometimes patients have been required to furnish information from genetic testing for healt h 
insurance, life insurance, and/or a job.   A Federal law, the Genetic Information 
Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance 
companies, group health plans, and employers with [ADDRESS_157392]. Maheen Mausoof Adamson, PhD, at (650)493- [ADDRESS_157393] using your blood may result in inventions or discoveries that could

minutes , which includes 20 minutes of rTMS treatment , plus some brief assessments.  
There will normally be between one to three daily sessions, Monday through Friday. During 
the intervention phase, the following will happen:  
• You will have been  randomized to either active “real rTMS” treatment or to sham 
treatment. Randomization is a process that is similar to flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin where one side of 
the coin is active and the other side is sham. There is a 50:[ADDRESS_157395] a fifty percent chance of receiving 
the “real rTMS” treatment. In active treatment “real rTMS”, brief pulses of magnetic 
energy are used to stimulate nerve cells in your brain. In sham treatment, the same machine is us ed but the nerve cells are not stimulated.  
Neither you nor your treatment provider will know which treatment you are getting until the study is over. This type of study is called a double blind trial and this study type is 
being used so that your treatment and evaluation won’t be affected by [CONTACT_138409] “real rTMS” or sham treatment. The study machine will know which treatment you are getting so that you will receive the same treatment at each visit. Additionally, for each treatment session, whether sham or active, 
each patient shall wear scalp electrodes through which a low -voltage, low electric 
current  will be passed in order to provide cutaneous stimulation.   At the same time, the 
Noise Generator is used to hide the click noise produced by [CONTACT_138410]. That is, when a magnetic stimulation pulse is fired, white noise is sent to the ears of the patient. This sham (white) noise will hide the click noise from the participant (active or placebo). If your treatment provider needs to know which treatment you are getting, he or she will 
be able to get that information.  Before the first treatment, we will ask you whether you 
believe you will receive the active “real rTMS” or the sham treatment. After the first treatment, and a fter the final treatment, we will ask you whether you believe you 
received the active “real rTMS” or the sham treatment.

• You will be retested to find your motor threshold on the first day of treatment, and then 
approximately weekly after that . You will be tested with an active coil to find the settings 
that will be used for you.  
• Brief assessment s will be administered.  
• You will be asked about any other drugs that you are taking and about side effects that 
may have occurred since your last visi t. These may or may not be related to the study 
treatment. You will also be asked about the amount of alcohol or other substances you 
have consumed since your last visit , and about how much sleep you got the night 
before your treatment . These questions wil l be asked at every session.  
• You may be asked to provide a urine sample several times randomly during this phase. 
This sample will be screened for the use of drugs. Your urine screen results may be disclosed to your primary physician if we think that you are using drugs in a risky 
manner. You may also not be allowed to receive your rTMS treatment.   
• If you are a woman of childbearing age, you will have a urine pregnancy test every four weeks through the end of the intervention phase to be sure that you are not pregnant.  
You may have a breathalyzer to determine your blood alcohol level several times 
randomly during this phase. This will be for the screening of alcohol use. Your results may be disclosed to your primary physician if we think that you are using alcohol in a 
risky manner. You may also not be allowed to receive your rTMS treatment.  
• A blood sample of about 4 tablespoons will be taken and used for assessment of 
plasma proteins  every 5 rTMS trea tments . Any samples left  over after analysis will be 
stored.  
 
The following is a description of the treatment procedure:  
• You will be awake and alert throughout the treatment session.  
• You will be reclined  in a chair. You will be provided with headphones . You will have 
electrodes placed on your forehead. Your head will be placed in a holder so that it is 
correctly positioned. You may close your eyes and rest , but not sleep.  
• A metal coil in a plastic case will be held against the scalp on the left side of your head. There is  a clicking noise as magnetic pulses are produced, but you will hear white noise 
through the headphones .  
• Participants may feel a tingling sensation on the head .  
• Depending on the treatment group that you have been assigned to, you will receive either active “real rTMS” or sham treatments.  
• You may drive yourself to and from treatment sessions and attend to your normal daily tasks.

happens with you and may or may not be related to your participation in this study. An independent committee will be told about all adverse events at least once every six months. If they believe that any aspect of this study is unsafe, they will recommend that changes be made to eliminate the safety problem.  
PARTICIPANT’S RESPONSIBILITIES  
You should:  
• Follow the instructi ons of the investigators and study staff.  
• Complete your questionnaires as instructed. You are free to skip any questions that you prefer not to answer.  
• Ask questions as you think of them.  
• Tell the investigator or research study staff if you stop using bi rth control or think you 
might be pregnant.  
• Tell the investigator or research staff if you change your mind about staying in the study.  
• While participating in this research study, do not take part in any other research study without approval from the inv estigators. This is to protect you from possible 
injury from things such as extra blood drawing or potential drug interactions. Taking part in other research studies without approval from the investigators may invalidate the results of this research, as well as that of the other studies.  
• Keep your study appointments. If it is necessary to miss an appointment, please contact [CONTACT_138412].  
• It is important that you not give false, incomplete, or misleading information about your medical history, including past and present drug use, because this could have serious consequences for your well -being.  
• The effects of alcohol and substance use while undergoing rTMS are not well known 
at this time. Alcohol use will be limited to [ADDRESS_157397] liquor, a day. You cannot use illegal substances, such as marijuana, cocaine, and amphetamines, during your participation in the study. If you begin to use substances during your participation in this trial, you may 
be removed from the study. If you report consuming more than one alcoholic beverage or using substances prior to your treatment session, study staff may choose to reschedule that session.

you will not lose any benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled (if applicable) and your decision will not affect your ability to receive medical care for your condition.  
If you want to stop being in the study you should tell the investigators or study staff.  You 
can do this by [CONTACT_138413]. Adamson  at [PHONE_316] x [ZIP_CODE].  
The investigators  may also withdraw you from the study without your consent for one or 
more of the following reasons:  Failure to follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and/or study staff ; if the Protocol Director decides that continuing your participation could be harmful 
to you;  pregnancy ; if you need treatment not allowed in the study ; if the study is cancelled;  for 
other administrative reasons ; or for other unanticipated circumstances.  
POSSIBLE RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES  
There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study.  
These deserve careful thought.  You should talk with the Protocol Director if you have any questions. This study involves  the following risks, discomforts, and possible inconveniences:  
rTMS  
A few patients receiving rTMS have had a seizure. All of the reported seizures resolved 
promptly on their own and none had any lasting effects or adverse impact on the patients. There i s little evidence of risk of seizures using rTMS the way it will be used in this study.  
In the unlikely event that a seizure does occur, you will be closely monitored and treated for 
any medical or psychological consequences. Lab tests will be drawn and y ou will be seen by a 
neurologist as soon as possible. The facility  where the rTMS studies are  performed are fully 
equipped to safely handle a seizure. You will be given a letter regarding the seizure to share with your primary health care provider. The letter will indicate that the seizure during rTMS does not increase your risk for future seizures .  
rTMS treatment can result in mild to moderate headaches in as many as [ADDRESS_157399] day was 
reported as very painful.  
There is a small risk of dental pain with rTMS, during or immediately after the treatment. If 
this occurs, let your study doctors and nurses know and they may be able to move the rTMS coil position or provide you with a bite block to reduce this pain or make it not happen.

There is a chance that the pi[INVESTIGATOR_138379], laboratory results, or other medical tests 
will show an abnormality that you did not  know about. This abnormality could be life-
threatening or not serious at all. Abnormal results might lead to more tests. If you are not  
eligible for VA care or benefits for the evaluation of these findings, we will, with your consent, send this information to your personal (Non- VA) physician. Your consent to this study serves 
as consent to contact [CONTACT_138414] (Non- VA) physician. You and your physician can arrange 
the necessary work -up and treatment. If you are not eligible for VA care for the evaluation of 
the unanticipated abnormality, the evaluation might cost you money out -of-pocket. Abnormal 
results also might lead to loss of insurability or loss of employment.  
MRI 
Magnetic fields do not cause harmful effects at the levels used in the MRI machine.  
However, the MR scanner uses a very strong magnet that will attract some metals and affect 
some electronic devices.  If you have a cardiac pacemaker or any other biomedical device in or on your body, it is very important that you tell the operator/investigat or immediately.  As 
metallic objects may experience a strong attraction to the magnet, it is also very important that you notify the operator of any metal objects (especially surgical clips), devices, or implants that are in or on your body before entering  the magnet room.  All such objects must be removed (if 
possible) before entering the magnet room.  In some cases, having those devices means you should not have an MRI scan performed.  In addition, watches and credit cards should also be

Before you enter the scanner, we will ask you questions about whether you have any non-
removable metal in your body. In addition, we may ask your permission to communicate with your physician to obtain information about your medical history if we need additional information to determine whether you should or should not have the MRI scan. If there is a good reason to suspect that you have metal in a part of your body (e.g., previous surgery in which the surgical report is not clear regarding implanted screws or wires), or if you have ever worked in a metal shop, we may arrange for you to have an x -ray to check that there are no 
metal fragments. The radiation exposure from this x -ray is equivalent to that occurring from 
natural sources over two months.  
You should also notify the operator/investigator if you have any tattoos on your body, 
including eyeliner and other permanent makeup.  Tattoos could become warm and irritated during the scan and remain so for several days.  If you would prefer not to participate in the MR scan due to the presence of tattoos on your body, please inform a research team member.  
There is a possibility that you will experience a localized twitching sensation due to the 
magnetic field changes during the scan.  This is expected and should not be painful.  
There is a risk of heating from radiofrequency imaging coils and their cables, button 
response boxes and their cables, and the cables from monitoring devices that record physiologic processes such as heartbeats per minute or electrical activity of the brain. Please report any heating sensation immediately. You may have the scan stopped at any time if this occurs.  
Dizziness or nausea may occur if you move your head rapi[INVESTIGATOR_138380].  
 If you have kidney problems, please tell the operator.  
IF YOU FEEL DISCOMFORT AT ANY TIME, NOTIFY THE OPERATOR AND YOU CAN 
DISCONTINUE THE EXAM AT ANY TIME.

This research study may involve exposure to radiation from one skull x -ray. This radiation 
exposure is not necessary for your medical car e and is for research purposes only. The 
additional amount of radiation is approximately equal to 50 days of radiation exposure from natural sources like the sun, ground and water. This amount of radiation involves minimal risk and is necessary to obtain t he research information desired.

Drawing blood is a routine procedure involving the possibility of slight bruising and/or 
infection at the needle puncture site. There may be some discomfort during insertion of the tube for withdrawing blood. On rare occ asions some patients have fainted while having their 
blood drawn. A clot could also form in the vein, resulting in temporary pain or tenderness in the area where the tube was placed. Infection is rare. To minimize these risks, experienced medical personnel  will handle all the blood drawing procedures. There is also a risk of scarring 
at the site of needle insertion with individuals having more pi[INVESTIGATOR_138381] a greater risk of this occurring.   
If, in an interview, you disclose that (a) you intend to harm yourself or someone else, (b) 
that a child had been abused or neglected, or (c) that an elder or dependent had been abused, we are required by [CONTACT_138416].  
For Women of Child- bearing Potential  
For safety reaso ns, pregnant women will not be allowed to participate in this study. This is 
because the effects of rTMS on an unborn child are not known. There may be unforeseeable 
(unanticipated) risks to the participant (or to the fetus ) if the participant is pregnant or becomes 
pregnant during the study.  
You will have a urine pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_157403] agree to use a medically acceptable form of birth control while

If you become pregnant during the intervention phase of the study, you will not be able to 
continue the study treatments. You will also be referred to a Women’s Health Clinic. If you 
become pregnant during the follow -up phase of the study, you will continue to come in for all 
remaining follow -up phase visits and will complete all assessments as you normally would.  
If you become pregnant at any time during the study, you will be asked to sign a release of 
information form for study staff to access medical r ecords to obtain information regarding the 
outcome of your pregnancy. No pediatric records will be reviewed.  
There is no likely effect on sperm count or the motility of sperm or other reproductive risks 
associated with fathering a child, although this has  not been formally tested in humans. 
Likewise, there are no known risks on sperm and ova (eggs).  
POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
We can’t promise that you will get any benefits from taking part in this research study. 
However, possible benefits may include relief from  pain and improvement in quality of life. The 
information that is obtained during this study may be scientifically useful and may lead to greater knowledge about the treatment of cognitive function with TBI .  
The medical testing done in this study could reveal a medical condition that you might not 
have previously been aware of and for which you may need treatment. Study staff will refer you for additional treatment if such problems are identified but the study will not pay for the treatment of any such identified problems. If you are not  eligible for VA care or benefits for the 
evaluation of these findings, we will, with your consent, send this information to your personal (Non -VA) physician. Your consent to this study serves as consent to contact [CONTACT_138417]

a) In layperson's language state the purpose of the study in 3-5 sentences.
Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)to Improve Cognitive Function in TBI: The proposed
study will evaluate the safety, durability and efficacy of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
(rTMS)as a promising non- invasive therapeutic treatment for executive function (EF)deficits and other
outcomes (such as: headache, pain, etc )seen in 100 Veterans with mild to moderate Traumatic Brain Injury
(TBI).
b) State what the Investigator (s)hope to learn from the study. Include an assessment of the importance of
this new knowledge.
Many returning OEF/OIF Veterans with concussion histories report
cognitive problems that may last for months or even years
(Schneiderman
et al., 2008; Hoge et al., 2008 ). Although deployment itself can
be
associated with cognitive problems (Vasterling et al, 2006 ),
having
co-
morbid conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
and
depression may prolong the symptoms of TBI resulting in lowered
attention, processing speed, learning and memory (Nelson et al.,
2012;
Caeyenberghs et al., 2012 ). Strong evidence also suggests that a
history of TBI increases risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_138384] (Eckart et al.,
2011). Significant progress has been made towards understanding
the
pathophysiology and neuropsychological changes associated with the
acute and long term sequelae of TBI, including its complicated
relationship with PTSD (Brenner et al., 2011; Hallbauer et al.,Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

2009;
Villamar et al., 2012 ). However, few studies have addressed what
mechanisms of TBI may be responsive to therapeutic treatment.
The most common cognitive difficulties faced by [CONTACT_138429],
verbal
fluency, poor planning, reduced working memory, and mental
flexibility
(Godefroy et al., 2003 ). A survey of Army infantry who suffered
from
TBI reported that 31.4 %complained of concentration problems and
24.6%
complained of memory problems (Nelson et al., 2012 ). Numerous
studies
confirm that Dorso Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC )is involved
in
inhibition, planning and set-switching - key components of
executive
function (Vanderhasselt et al., 2006 ). Deficits in executive
function
following mild TBI (mTBI)are also associated with injury to the
axons
and involve the DLPFC (Lipton et al., 2009 ). In fact, patients
with
focal lesions in this brain region performed significantly worse
than
controls on the Trail Making Test (TMT: primary outcome measure )
suggesting impaired cognitive set-shifting (Yochim et al., 2007 ).
Moreover, control participants performed significantly better on
TMT
than patients with mTBI (Brooks et al., 1999 ). We hope to
demonstrate
improvement of this deficit in Veterans with mild and moderate TBI
through rTMS treatment. Additionally we would also report on the
efficacy of using functional brain connectivity (thru advanced
neuroimaging )as a biomarker to capture this improvement in
executive
function.
Previous studies have documented the relationship between injury
severity, cognitive impairment and functional status (Bush et al.,
2003; Senathi-Raja et al., 2010 ). In fact, Bercaw et al, (2011)
reported that neuropsychological performance at year [ADDRESS_157412]
been documented, 7 %to 33%of these patients experience persistent
symptoms (Belanger et al., 2005 ). Note that regardless of injury
severity, one of the most frequently reported post-TBI sequelae is
cognitive dysfunction (e.g, memory problems and executive
function:
Terrio et al., 2009; Senathi-Raja et al., 2010 ). Among these

there is often little correlation between subjective (e.g, self-
report)
and objective markers (eg, neuropsychological test performance )of
such
dysfunction (Brenner et al., 2011 ). Moreover these cognitive
complaints
have been associated with poorer psychosocial functioning (eg,
return
to work; Benedictus et al., 2010 ).
Specific Aims are:
To assess the efficacy and durability of benefits of repetitive
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)as a promising non-
invasive
therapeutic treatment for executive function deficits seen in
Veterans
with mild to moderate TBI.
Primary Hypothesis:
Veterans with mild to moderate TBI receiving active rTMS treatment
will show improvement of > [ADDRESS_157413]-treatment on any one of the following: the Trail Making Test
part
B, D-KEFS Verbal Fluency and/or D-KEFS Color-Word Interference
Test)
than Veterans receiving sham rTMS.
Primary Objective:
To assess the efficacy of rTMS in improving executive functioning
in
Veterans with mild to moderate TBI in order to maximize
rehabilitation
outcomes.
Secondary Hypotheses:
1. Sustained Improvement. At the end of the 6-month post treatment
follow-up, TBI patients who received rTMS would be more likely to
continue to have reduced symptoms, i.e. greater "executive
function
improvement" than patients who received sham rTMS.
2. Secondary consequences of TBI will improve with rTMS treatment,
i.e.
scores on Quality of Life (QOL)scale will show significantly
greater
improvement in patients with mild to moderate TBI who received
rTMS
treatment.
3. Moderators of Response. Age, severity of symptoms at baseline,

4. Greater functional connectivity will be observed in hub centers
of
the Default Mode Network (DMN), particularly the
precuneous/posterior
cingulate area as measured by [CONTACT_138430]-up
compared
to baseline in those TBI patients treated with rTMS compared to
those
treated with sham.
5. Mediators of Response to Treatment: to establish a preliminary
understanding of the underlying mechanisms related to rTMS
modulation
of synaptic repair in TBI we will also look at Brain Derived
Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)plasma samples in our population.
B. Secondary Objectives
1. To evaluate the durability of benefit of rTMS in treatment of
executive function deficits (patients receiving
rTMS are more likely to show significant improvement at [ADDRESS_157414]
treatment than those receiving
sham).
2. To evaluate post treatment the impact of rTMS treatment on
everyday
functioning as defined by [CONTACT_94259] (QOL)scale, a
frequently
used clinical measure.
3. To evaluate other moderators of response to rTMS treatment such
as
age, time since injury and severity of PTSD (assessed by [CONTACT_88806]-
checklist
score)as well as depression, sleep substance abuse, fatigue or
any
combinations of these factors.
4. To evaluate resting state functional MRI (fMRI)as a biological
marker of response to rTMS treatment.
5. To evaluate underlying biological mechanisms involving BDNF in
synaptic repair and/or change in network connectivity resulting
from
rTMS treatment.
6. To evaluate improvement in headaches and pain reporting following rTMS treatment using responses on
the assessment HIT-6 (HIT-6 has been included with the original protocol on Section 16 )

3. Background
a) Describe past experimental and/or clinical findings leading to the formulation of the study.
Overview of rTMS in Cognitive Dysfunction in mild and ModerateTBI
Repetitive TMS is a method of delivering therapeutic, non-invasive
brain stimulation. While not yet utilized in TBI research on a
large
scale, rTMS is well suited for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_138387] (e.g., team of 5 MD's, 1 RN, 3 clinical
neuropsychologists
and 2 neuroimaging researchers in the VA ). rTMS is currently being
used
at the VA Palo Alto and Stanford University in the treatment of:
pain
(VA Rehabilitation grant funded: PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ashford & Co-I/Co-
Protocol
Director: [CONTACT_138471] ), depression (VA Co-op studies funded, PI:
[INVESTIGATOR_124].
Rosen; Co-op studies funded, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yesavage ), and PTSD (NIH
funded
project: [CONTACT_138472] ). At present it is an FDA-approved for
treatment
for
major depression (Oreardon et al., 2007; George et al., 2010: [CONTACT_138473], current consultant ). A recent VA study reported
improvements
in
PTSD and related symptoms in Veterans with PTSD who received rTMS
(Watts et al., 2012 ). Also of relevance in our TBI Veterans, a
major
industry trial of rTMS in Treatment Refractory Major Depression
(TRMD )
has been completed. This randomized controlled trial involved 301
medication-free patients with TRMD and excluded patients dual-
diagnosed
with co-morbid substance abuse (past year )or PTSD. Response and
remission rates were significantly better in rTMS than in controls
at
the end of 6 weeks treatment, but results were smaller and notProtocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

are
quite good, with over 90 %retention of remission 12 months later
in a
treatment resistant group (Demitrack, 2013 ). This compares to a
50%
relapse rate in similar populations who are treated with ECT, or
even
worse outcomes in patients treated with medications (STAR*D ). We
are
now rediscovering how exercise, practice, and stimulation can
cause
plastic changes in the brain (Colcombe et al, 2006 ). In sum, the
only
way to discover whether there are acute or more durable effects
with
rTMS treatment for TBI is to do the proposed study. )
(Rationale for rTMS use in EF improvement: Repetitive TMS
treatment
can
induce neuronal long-term potentiation (Wang et al 2011 )involving
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)resulting in synaptic
repair
(Cheeran et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2013 ). Pape et al (2006)
reviewed
the
evidence for rTMS as a possible intervention for TBI-induced
cognitive
dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease and strokes. So
far,
improvements after rTMS treatments (stimulation site: DLPFC in
neurobehavioral outcomes (Pape et al., 2009 )and executive
function
(Pachalska et al., 2011 )have only been reported in severe TBI
patients. Case studies (Bonni et al., 2013 )have found rTMS to
lead to
improved cognitive functioning in patients with TBI. A recent
review
of
rTMS studies across various mental illnesses strongly suggests its
use
in TBI to promote recovery and minimize disabilities (Demirtas-
Tatlided
et al., 2012 ). Stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex
(DLPFC )has led to improvements in major depressive disorder.
This
brain area has also been shown to be involved in executiveProtocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

functioning
(Yochim et al., 2007 ), and we thus hypothesize that stimulation of
this
area will lead to concomitant improvement in executive
functioning ).
The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_138388]: 1 )It will incorporate dual-diagnosis TBI (mild and
moderate )
patients including patients with PTSD. These dual-diagnosis
patients
are usually excluded from industry and National Institute of
Health
trials and as such the proposed study is unique in that it will
address
the patient that providers encounter in the VA system
specifically. 2 )
It will focus on improvements in cognitive dysfunction - a major
complaint for many Veterans who may not seek medical care and
which
will impact their cognitive health and independence as they grow
older.
3)Furthermore, unlike industry trials, the proposed study will
use a
sham rTMS procedure that will be more difficult to distinguish
from
the
actual rTMS.
b) Describe any animal experimentation and findings leading to the formulation of the study.
Animal analogues, primarily rats, have been used in the testing of
rTMS.
Results
from these
studies have been crucial in establishing the safety parameters
for
use
with humans.

i) Describe your screening procedures, including how qualifying laboratory values will be obtained. If
you are collecting personal health information prior to enrollment (e.g., telephone screening ), please
request a waiver of authorization for recruitment (in section 15 ).
Research Assistants will assess for participant eligibility in a telephone screen. Telephone screening will
assess a potential participant's background, demographics, health questions, and psychiatric stability. Study
Personnel will meet once per week to review, discuss, and make determinations about the appropriateness of
potential participants for the study.
If by [CONTACT_138435] (approximately end of year one )we are unable to get 20 participants per year, we will
reconsider inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Patients who are screened over the telephone for possible eligibility for the study will be listed on the
Patient Screening Log. Note: we will make all our efforts to screen patients for both rTMS and MRI
exclusions but as our primary aim is to test rTMS for use in TBI population, we will enroll participants in
the study who are ineligible to be in the MRI scanner but eligible for rTMS treatment. After the patient
signs the Informed Consent Form, the on-site screening procedures and assessments can be initiated.
Data will be collected on paper forms and questionnaires, and entered into encrypted, password-protected
databases located on physically secure VA servers behind a firewall. All types of data collected will be
de-identified according to the VHA Privacy Handbook 1200.12. Each subject will be assigned a subject ID
(SUBID ). The SUBID codebook will be maintained by [CONTACT_978], and will be available to appropriate members
of the research team but kept in a locked file cabinet or in an encrypted, password-protected file on a
physically secure, password protected computer at VAPA.
All research personnel involved in this study will have successfully completed all applicable VA, and
Stanford training. All subject-level identifiable data will be treated as Protected Heath Information (PHI)
unless that data does NOT contain any of the data elements that HIPAA considers protected. No sensitive
data or PHI will be stored on any device other than the secure server. Paper forms will be stored in locked
file cabinets in locked offices.
Data from the rTMS study will be entered into a designed ACCESS database and maintained on a VA
server located at VAPA, password protected, encrypted and no PHI will be present.
j) Describe how you will be cognizant of other protocols in which participants might be enrolled. Please
explain if participants will be enrolled in more than one study.
We will ask the potential subject if they are participating in any other protocols. They will be instructed not
to participate in any other protocols during their involvement with our study without first getting prior
authorization from both our research team and that of the other study. Overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_138391] a case-by-case basis.

a) For the following categories include a scientific estimate of the frequency, severity, and reversibility of potential
risks. Wherever possible, include statistical incidence of complications and the mortality rate of proposed
procedures. Where there has been insufficient time to accumulate significant data on risk, a statement to this
effect should be included. (In describing these risks in the consent form to the participant it is helpful to use
comparisons which are meaningful to persons unfamiliar with medical terminology. )

The risks of the Procedures to be performed. Include all investigational, non-investigational and
non-invasive procedures (e.g., surgery, blood draws, treadmill tests ).
rTMS - rTMS Safety especially for Mild and Moderate TBI Veterans
After a decade of research, rTMS is generally regarded as safe and without lasting side effects if established
guidelines are followed (Janicak et al., 2008; Machii et al., 2006 ). There have been no significant cognitive
(Triggs et al., 1999; Little et al., 2000 ), neurological (Nahas et al., 2000 )or cardiovascular sequelae reported
as a result of rTMS.
The primary safety concern with rTMS, in any population, has been the risk of seizure induction. Eight
seizures have been reported secondary to rTMS (Wassermann, 1998 ). These have occurred in a sample size
estimated to be over several thousand rTMS treatment sessions. The rTMS community has adopted and
widely used the guidelines prescribing a safe interval between pulse trains (Gerloff et al., 1997 )and the
safety guidelines from a National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS )workshop on
rTMS. To our knowledge there have been two publications since 1997 describing events during rTMS that
might be considered seizures. Conca and colleagues reported a patient who experienced a 'pseudoabsence
seizure'. It is unclear if this was a true seizure (Conca et al., 2000 ). Bernabeu and colleagues reported on a
patient who had a seizure during rTMS. In this case, there was a brief interstimulus interval (Bernabeu et al.,
2004). The risk of seizures for rTMS treatment is less than 1 %.
How does this impact our study: The current safety guidelines have not been tested for mild and moderate
TBI population which is precisely the purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_50522]. In TBI population, posttraumatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_138392] # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

Title : Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to Improve Cognitive Function in TBI
Approval Period: 12/11/2018 - 02/13/[ADDRESS_157420] common delayed sequelae of TBI. But this incidence is very low (about 5 %)in TBI patients
with closed head injury (Ropper et al., 2005 )who are most likely our mild and moderate TBI patients. In a
clinical setting, for example in Polytrauma Transitional Rehabilitation Program (PTRP – VAPA )the
expected recovery trajectory for persons with mTBI is full cognitive recovery in 3-6 months following
injury. Persisting or worsening cognitive status is often related to other co-morbid psychiatric issues, such as
depression and PTSD, chronic pain, sleep apnea (all will be )used as covariates in our analysis ). Including
persons with moderate TBI in our study would likely allow for examination of rehabilitation treatment
effects on cognitive functioning for those who tend to have persisting cognitive difficulties following injury.
On PTRP, patients are often admitted from the acute inpatient rehab unit on anticonvulsant medications if
they had a seizure [ADDRESS_157421] seizure varies greatly (Demirtas-Tatlidede et al., 2012 )and must be considered as a
variable for recruitment in this study. Currently PTRP houses patients [ADDRESS_157422] TBI. Note,
that there is only one case study which performed detailed safety assessments and reported a lack of adverse
events in a patient with severe TBI following application of a specific rTMS protocol over 5 consecutive
days through 6 weeks (Pape et al., 2009 ). Our protocol will be highly stringent and will exclude any severe
TBI patients (including those with any fractures, metal plates or open head injuries ), acute patients or those
who have had a concussion within the last [ADDRESS_157423].
MRI - The study participant may get a metal taste in their mouth or some tingling in their hands or feet
during the MRI scan. Occasionally, individuals experience claustrophobia (fear of confinement in a small
space)during the MRI scan.
The risks of the Radioisotopes/radiation-producing machines (e.g., X-rays, CT scans, fluoroscopy )and
associated risks.
X-ray - x-ray involves exposure to an FDA-approved low dose of radiation. The radiation exposure from
such x-rays is equivalent to that occurring from natural sources over two months, and increases the risk of
cancer by 1/250,000.
The risks of the Physical well-being.
See above, Procedures to be performed.
The risks of the Psychological well-being.
A psychiatric screening will be performed to determine whether the participant meets inclusion and
exclusion criteria for the study. From past experience, potential risk to participants is expected to be
minimal. Specifically, questions asked may be potentially distressing to the participants or may cause them
to think about problems relating to them that may be anxiety-provoking or upsetting. We have created and
attached a suicidality protocol in the event that such a protocol is needed.
Cognitive Testing. There do not appear to be any risks associated with cognitive testing other than the
commitment of significant time for participation. Some participants may experience anxiety during and after
the cognitive
testing.
Questionnaires. There are virtually no risks involved in filling out the questionnaires, sleep-wake cycle
questionnaires and sleep logs other than the time involved.
MRI. One possible psychological risk is that some people experience claustrophobia during an MRI, or
lesser degrees of anxiety.

•Loss of confidentiality.
o Every precaution will be taken to minimize loss of confidentiality. A double lock system will be
maintained: within a locked office and locked file cabinet. All electronic data will be secured on an
encrypted, password-protected database behind a VA firewall.
MRI
•There are no expected risks associated with the MR imaging of brain function, other than the possibility of
some mild frustration and mild fatigue. The study participant may get a metal taste in their mouth or some
tingling in their hands or feet during the MRI scan. Occasionally, individuals experience claustrophobia
(fear of confinement in a small space )during the MRI scan.
o Breaks will be provided in order to reduce the possibility of frustration and fatigue.
o The metal taste sensations go away after the scan is complete.
o The MRI scanners have built-in communication systems, so study participants will have constant contact
[CONTACT_138436]. If the participant experiences severe claustrophobia, they will be asked to
discontinue participation in the imaging measures in this study.
•Study personnel will verbally review the currently approved and required VA MRI scan checklist at the
time of the telephone screen, and before every scheduled MR scan.
rTMS
In the unlikely event that a seizure does occur, the participant will be closely monitored and treated for any
medical or psychological consequences. Lab tests will be drawn and the participant will be seen by a
neurologist as soon as possible. The facility where the rTMS studies are performed is fully equipped to
safely handle a seizure. The participant will be given a letter regarding the seizure to share with his or her
primary health care provider. The letter will indicate that the seizure during rTMS does not increase risk for
future seizures.
rTMS treatment can result in mild to moderate headaches in as many as [ADDRESS_157424] day was reported as very painful.
There is a small risk of dental pain with rTMS, during or immediately after the treatment. If this occurs,
study staff may be able to move the rTMS coil position or provide a bite block to reduce this pain or make it
not happen.
rTMS treatment may produce movement or tingling of the arm, leg, face or scalp. Participants may also
experience a temporary feeling of numbness in the face.Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

a) Describe the informed consent process. Include the following.
i) Who is obtaining consent? (The person obtaining consent must be knowledgeable about the study. )
ii) When and where will consent be obtained?
iii) How much time will be devoted to consent discussion?
iv) Will these periods provide sufficient opportunity for the participant to consider whether or not to
participate and sign the written consent?
v) What steps are you taking to minimize the possibility of coercion and undue influence?
vi) If consent relates to children and if you have a reason for only one parent signing, provide that
rationale for IRB consideration.
i. Trained study personnel will be conducting telephone screening. All will be trained and knowledgeable
about the study. ii. Screening will happen on VA office phones, in a secure and private office setting, and
every effort will be made to ensure that the potential research participant is in a private and comfortable
environment at the time of screening. iii. 45 minutes is allotted for telephone screening, but it is possible
that it oculd take additional time in order to answer participant questions, as needed. iv & v. First, the
information contained in the telephone screen is explained in language they can understand. Repetition is
required during any learning process and is incorporated into the telephone screening procedures.
Additionally, throughout the screening process participants are encouraged to ask questions, and screeners
repeatedly check in to make sure everything is understood so far and ask if htere are any questions. Special
care is taken to repeatedly inform prospective participants that their participation is entirely voluntary and
that they may withdraw at any time and for any reason without penalty or loss of currently existing benefits.
The emphasis on the voluntary nature of participation is designed to minimize the possibility of coercion or
undue influence on participation. vi. N/A
b) What is the Procedure to assess understanding of the information contained in the consent? How will
the information be provided to participants if they do not understand English or if they have a hearing
impairment? See HRPP Chapter12.[ADDRESS_157429]

study, they are asked to sign and date the last page. Understanding English is a requirement for this study.
c) What steps are you taking to determine that potential participants are competent to participate in the
decision-making process? If your study may enroll adults who are unable to consent, describe (i)how
you will assess the capacity to consent, (ii)what provisions will be taken if the participant regains the
capacity to consent, (iii)who will be used as a legally authorized representative, and (iv)what
provisions will be made for the assent of the participant.
All participants in this study must be able to independently consent to participate.

i) List the people to whom you have formally delegated responsibility to obtain informed consent, and
state whether they have the appropriate training to perform this activity.
All study personnel (PI, study coordinator, research assistants, RN/RNP/PA )will be appropriately trained to
obtain informed consent.
ii) Will legally effective informed consent be obtained from the participant or the participant's legally
authorized representative (LAR)or both? If LAR, is it clear who can serve as LAR?
Legally effective informed consent will be obtained. Use of an LAR would exclude a participant from
eligibility.
iii) Will the circumstances of the consent process minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence
and provide the prospective participant or their representative sufficient opportunity to consider
whether to participate?
Minimization of the possibility of coercion or undue influence will be done by [CONTACT_138441], and any questions are answered. Next, the
prospective participant is asked to summarize the consent form with special focus on the discomforts, risks,
and confidentiality sections. When prospective participants have demonstrated (by [CONTACT_138442])that they understand the purposes, risks, and benefits of the study, they are asked to sign and date the
last page. The emphasis on the voluntary nature of participation is designed to minimize the possibility of
coercion or undue influence on participation.

v) Will the information being communicated to the participant or the representative during the consent
process exclude any exculpatory language through which the participant or the representative is made
to waive or appear to waive the participant's legal rights, or release or appear to release the
investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agent from liability for negligence (e.g. I give up any
property rights I may have in bodily fluids or tissue samples obtained in the course of the research )?
No exculpatory language through which the participant or the representative is made to waive or appear to
waive the participant's legal rights, or release or appear to release the investigator, the sponsor, the
institution, or its agent from liability for negligence is included.
vi) Please confirm the following:
a. A witness to the participant's signature [CONTACT_138465]'s legally authorized representative's
signature [CONTACT_138466].
b. If the sponsor or the IRB requires a witness to the consenting process in addition to the witness to
the participant's signature [CONTACT_138467], a note to that
effect is placed under the witness's signature [CONTACT_4548].
c. A copy of the signed and dated consent document will be given to the person signing the consent
document.
d. The consent form is on the VA Form 10-1086.
Select one of the following regulatory criteria for a waiver of documentation (signature )and provide a
protocol-specific justification:
1) 45 CFR 46.117 (c)(i). For research that is not subject to FDA regulation, the only record linking
the participants and the research would be the consent document,and the principal risk would
be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality; each participant will be asked
whether he/she wants documentation linking the participant with the research, and the
participant's wishes govern.
2) 45 CFR 46.117 (c)(ii). For research that is not subject to FDA regulation, presents no more than
minimal risk of harm to participants and involves no procedures for which written consent is
normally required outside of the research context.
3) 45 CFR 46.117 (c)(iii). For research not subject to FDA regulation, if subjects or legally
authorized representatives (LAR)are members of a distinct cultural group in which signing
forms is not the norm, the research presents no more than minimal risk and there is an
appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.
4) Y 21 CFR 56.109 (c)(1). For research that is subject to FDA regulation, presents no more thanProtocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

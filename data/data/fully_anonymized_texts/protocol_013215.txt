agrees  to adhere to all stipulations of this protocol, the conditions of IRB approval, federal and local regulatory 
requirements, and 21  CFR 812, ISO -[ZIP_CODE] and International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidance 
ICH GCP.  
1.1 Background  and Rati onale  
Monitoring vital signs (pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and temperature), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and anesthesia 
parameters is considered standard for managing patients during anesthesia. However, the end target organ of action for 
anesthetic agen ts (the brain) is not routinely monitored.  
The FDA -cleared Masimo SedLine brain function monitor is indicated for use in the operating room (OR), intensive care unit 
(ICU), and clinical research laboratory. It is intended to monitor the state of the brain  by [CONTACT_5203] -time data acquisition and 
processing of electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. The system includes the Patient State Index (PSITM), a proprietary 
computed EEG variable that is related to the effect of anesthetic agents.  
In the last couple of decades a number of monitors (and/or indices) for monitoring depth of anesthesia were validated by 
[CONTACT_108562] -state anesthetic concentration, and / or arousal. 
The performance  of Bispectral index (BIS),  state entropy/response entropy and the Narcotrend index has been published in 
a large number of adult studies. In general, no particular index has been shown to be substantially superior in these studies . 
Use of brain function m onitoring has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, by [CONTACT_108563] [1]. Although brain function monitoring has been in use for more than [ADDRESS_120567] of care 
as confounding factors such as polypharmacy; low EEG power; EEG dynamics versus age; and patient temperature were not 
included in the original training data set. This can lead to reduced accuracy under these condition s.  
Processed EEG -based monitor indexes such as BIS and Patient State Index (PSI™) have been shown to be useful in assessing 
brain activity during sedation and general anesthesia. Though both indices have shown predictive value in assessing levels 
of sedat ion/awareness, there has only been marginal correlation between the two [2, 3].  
Previous attempts to compare the performance of BIS and PSI indices  were limited to applying both sensors simultaneously 
on the forehead. With limited space and common sensors between two sets of devices, it was possible that s ome sensors 
were not positioned according to manufacturer’s instructions. This protocol is designed to allow comparison of these 2 
indices during clinical care. The inclusion of standardized clinical observations, acquisition of raw and processed 
physiolog ical data, and anesthesia records used singularly or in combination will provide an opportunity to objectively 
evaluate the performance of the two devices under a wide range of clinical and patient conditions.  
2 STUDY DESIGN & OBJECTIVES  
2.1 General Design  
The primary objective is to compare the performance of SedLine  and the comparator’s  device  systems during surgery. 
Relative accuracy of the individual depth of sedation indices will be compared.   
This is a sponsored, prospective, non -blinded, non -randomized study. PSI, BIS and  other supplemental data from both 
monitors will be collected using electronic data collection tools such as PulseOx  ADC and Rugloop.  Additionally, raw EEG 
data from  PulseOx  ADC will be collected.  This raw data can be used by [CONTACT_108564]. 
Vital signs and anesthetic records may  also be collected from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_108551] ( EMR ) to aid fair 
comparison between both devices .

 EEG data and either of two indices ( PSI/BIS)  will not be used to guide clinical care or decisions. Raw data and sedation 
indices collected from both monitors will be used post -hoc (after surgery) to compare performance.  
2.2 Study Endpoint  
Primary endpoint is to compare performance of PSI and BIS indices  across anesthesia range, Electromyography ( EMG ), Burst 
Suppression State  and low power EEG  conditions .

be completed for each device and signed by [CONTACT_108568]. It is important that the designated study staff counts and verifies 
that the shipment contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory. Any damaged or unusable study devices in a 
given shipment will be documented in the study files. The investigator must notify the study  sponsor of any damaged or 
unusable study devices that were supplied to the investigator’s site.  
5.1.2 Use of Study Device  
Use of devices and sensors will be documented on case report forms (CRF) for each subject. Any unused devices must be 
returned to the Sponsor at the end of the study . 
5.1.[ADDRESS_120574] all device deficiencies on the case report form and report to the Sponsor.  
5.2 Risk/Benefits  
Benefits:  There will be no direct benefits to the enrolled subjects.  Future benefits to subjects might include continuous 
monitoring of patients level of sedation and sleep state sleep quality and an additional tool for determining patients mental  
status.  
Device r isks:  All devices used in the study are FDA -cleared. The devices are non -invasive and present minimal risk to the 
enrolled subjects.  
Sensor risks: 3rd party EEG/EKG function by [CONTACT_108569]. These  
senso rs are non -invasive and present minimal risk to the patient .  
The 3rd party EEG/EKG sensors  being used as part of the system makes the system non -defibrillator proof. This means that 
in the event that a defibrillator needs to be used, all of the electrodes connected to the subject will need to be removed. 
Study investigators will be trained and made aware of this possible risk.  
6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
At any time during study procedures , the  physician , anesthesiologists and/or anesthesia providers  or bedside nurse, at their 
discretion, can discontinue study procedures and exercise clinical judgment to s afeguard the subject’s healt h, safety, and 
welfare.  Masimo  data will not be used to guide clinical care or decisions.

 7 STATISTICAL PLAN  
Initial subjects may be enrolled for the purposes of protocol training/learning. Data from these initial subjects may or may 
not be used in the interim or final analysis . As needed, the site can be permitted to enroll  up to the first 10 subjects  for t his 
purpose . Informed consent will be obtained from these s ubje cts. 
7.1 For this study, analysis of BIS and PSI will be performed under four major categories:  
 BIS/PSI performance across anesthesia range (Drug Response)  
 BIS/PSI performance during EMG (Electromyogram)  
 BIS/PSI performance during Burst Suppression State  
 BIS/PSI performance during low power EEG from aging brain [4] (70 -90 years)  
7.1.1  BIS/PSI performance across anesthesia range:  
 Total duration of incorrect index reporting for various anestheti c drugs such as GABA ergic  drugs  and Nitrous Oxide , 
and levels using raw EEG data as reference to estimate appropriate clinical sedation levels.  
 Total instances in which the index would have provided incorrect clinical guidance leading to more or less 
anes thetic agent administration.  
o Epi[INVESTIGATOR_108553] “arousal events” during anesthesia as indicated by [CONTACT_108571]/or blood 
pressure by [CONTACT_2669] 20% will be noted with time entry and comment for later comparison to index. 
Anesthetic agent adm inistration at the time of the “arousal event” will be noted as end -tidal inhaled 
anesthetic concentration or intravenous drug and administration rate as appropriate to the anesthetic 
administered.  
o Epi[INVESTIGATOR_108554] “deep anesthesia events” du ring anesthesia as indicated by [CONTACT_108572]/or blood pressure of at least 20%will be noted with time entry and comment for later 
comparison to index. Anesthetic agent administration at the time of the “deep anesthesia event” will be 
noted as  end-tidal inhaled anesthetic concentration or intravenous drug and administration rate as 
appropriate to the anesthetic administered.  
o The number of “arousal events” and “deep anesthesia events” per patient will be entered for each patient  
7.1.2  BIS/PSI perform ance during EMG (Electromyogram)  
 To measure the influence of EMG on calculation of sedation index, correlate changes in sedation index with OAAS 
or surgical stress known to the anesthesiologist.  
 Frequency of false positive and false negative instances of “ arousal events”.   
7.1.3 BIS/PSI performance during Burst Suppression State  
 Frequency of false positive and false negative burst  suppression detection for each patient. Overall accuracy will be 
calculated across all patients. Raw EEG data would be the reference to determine the presence/absence of burst 
suppression.  
 Instances of incorrect sedation index values during burst suppression state.  
7.1.4 BIS/PSI performance during low power EEG from ag ing brain (70-90 years)  
 Similar and relevant analysis will be performed as stated in section  7.1.1.

 11.4 It will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the study, to verify the 
adherence to the CIP and the co mpleteness, consistency and accuracy of the data being entered on them.  
11.5 During each visit, the monitor will also verify presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, and documentation of SAEs/SADEs and protocol deviations/vi olations, and check CRF against source 
documentation.  
11.6 After each visit, the monitor will provide a monitoring follow -up letter  to the investigator within 4 weeks of visit 
completion. The monitoring follow -up letter  will detail findings and open action items observed during the visit. It 
is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_52695](s) to respond to the findings of the 
monitoring follow -up letter , and complete any open action items as soon as possible but no later than 60 days of 
receiving the monitoring follow -up letter . Any open action items not completed within the time allowed may be 
sufficient grounds for study site suspension or termination; it will be up to the sponsor to determine wh ether any 
incomplete action items are sufficient grounds for suspension or termination. See Section 13 for details on 
suspension and termination.  
11.7 Depending on the quality of the data and/or changes to factors affecting patient safety, additional monitorin g 
visits may be necessary according at the sponsor’s discretion.  
[ADDRESS_120591]’s record and provide a copy to the subject as well. The Investigator shall not allow a 
subject to participate in a study or sign consent prior to IRB approval.  
Prior to the start of data collection or subject enrollment, the Investigator must pr ovide documentation of IRB approval of 
the study protocol and a copy of the approved informed consent form (21 CFR 50).  
All subjects will be monitored closely throughout the study. The following measures will be taken to ensure the privacy of 
subjects:  
 A code (unique identification) number for each subject will be kept on file.  
 Only their correspondence identification number will identify subjects.  
 Access to the documents and data will only be made to the Investigators and study staff in the study.  
 The co nfidentiality of these documents will be protected to the extent provided by [CONTACT_67204].  
12.2 Institutional Review Boards  
The Sponsor and/or Investigator must submit the protocol to the appropriate IRB and obtain a copy of the written and 
dated approval letter.  
The approval letter should state the name [CONTACT_108587], date of review, date of approval, and reference the 
study name (protocol title, study number, and version).  
The informed consent used by [CONTACT_108580]. The Investigator cannot enroll subjects until a copy of the approved informed consent is obtained from the IRB.  
Any amendments to the protocol or informed consent should be submitted to the IRB for review and ap proval per [ADDRESS_120592] of the study or pose safety risks to the subjects.

 12.3 Confidentiality  
All data collected will be kept confidential and de -identified. It can only be accessed by [CONTACT_108581].  
12.4 Protocol Amendments  
Any changes made to the clinical investigational plan/study protocol will be documented  by [CONTACT_108582]. Before 
submitting protocol amendment to the IRB for approval, the protocol amendment must be agreed upon and signed by [CONTACT_108583]. The Investigator shall not make any changes to the protocol without Spons or approval 
and documented approval from the IRB. Both PI [INVESTIGATOR_108558].  
12.5 Suspension or Termination of Study Site  
The Sponsor can suspend or pr ematurely terminate the PI’s and study site’s participation in the study, particularly if 
Sponsor finds serious non -compliance by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_108559], and if such non -compliance was not resolved in a timely manner. 
The Sponsor will document the decision to susp end or terminate the investigation in writing. A suspended study site cannot 
enroll new subjects.  
If the Sponsor determine that the study site’s compliance to GCP and federal regulations to be inadequate at any point 
during the study, and Sponsor move to suspend or terminate the study site, the Sponsor will provide notification in writing 
to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_108560]. The study site is eligible for reinstatement upon correction of any findi ngs 
and any open action items prior to the su spension, and provides a written guarantee that the same non -compliance will not 
reoccur in the future. Site can only resume patient enrollment upon receiving written notification of reinstatement from 
the Sponsor and/or IRB.  
12.6 Termination of Clinical Inves tigation/Study due to UADE  
The clinical investigation may be terminated if Sponsor determines that an unanticipated adverse device effect presents an 
unreasonable risk to the subjects. Termination shall occur not later than [ADDRESS_120593].  
The Sponsor may resume the terminated clinical investigation with prior IRB approval if the device is non -significant risk.  
13 AGREEMENT BET WEEN INVESTIGATOR AN D SPONSOR REGARDING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR  GOOD CLINICAL 
PRACTICE

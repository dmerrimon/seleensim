insulin sensitivity and suppress inflammatory recruitment. Thus, while pharmacologic PPARα 
activation effectively 'cured' fibrosing steatohepatitis in a murine, dietary model, the efficacy of 
such agents is less clear in humans. PPARγ is found predominantly in adipocytes. It has both 
opposite and complementary functions to PPARα. Thus, PPARγ activation leads to 
differentiation of adipocytes from pre-adipocytes in-vitro . This increases the lipid storage 
capacity of the adipose mass and in animals, also increases the number of small, insulin-sensitive 
adipocytes so as to improve insulin sensitivity. Increasingly, the importance of PPARγ is being 
recognized in the liver, despi[INVESTIGATOR_144985]. 
Steatosis is often associated with increased hepatocyte expression of PPARγ.

guidelines, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_144995] (SD), Site Master 
File (SMF), Informed Consent Forms/Documents (ICF/ICD) and other logs/forms during the 
conduct of a study. 
All laboratory reports should be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or his/her designee and any abnormal 
findings should be addressed. All protocol deviations occurring on the study shall be documented 
and the Sponsor and IEC/IRB informed. 
Patients clinically suspected of NASH will be invited for a screening programme for inclusion in 
the study. Patients will be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Clinical 
evaluation will be conducted for baseline characteristics and anthropometry measurements such 
as body weight and height. 
After clinical evaluation
s, all baseline safety and efficacy parameters will be recorded as per 
Table 1. All laboratory collections will be performed following overnight fasting (at least 8 hrs). 
Following confirmation of all clinical and laboratory inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients 
will continue into the screening period. During the screening period liver biopsy will be 
performed. However, if a biopsy was performed within [ADDRESS_165942] on NASH

Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) (Version 4.03 or higher) system will be used 
for reporting and grading AEs. 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. 
Any medical condition already present at screening should not be reported as an adverse event 
unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline changes in severity or 
seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it should be reported as an adverse event. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g. electrocardiogram) findings 
that are detected during the study or are present at screening and significantly worsen during the 
study should be reported as AEs. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_145011]. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study 
will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically 
significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
9.4.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse e
vent is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of

and grading AEs severity of events not classified in CTCAE will be assessed according to the 
following scale:  
Mild: Event is usually transient and easily tolerated, requiring no special treatment and causing 
no disruption of the subject’s normal daily activities.  
Moderate: Event introduces a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may 
interfere with daily activities, but is usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]. Moderate 
experiences may cause some interference with functioning.  
Severe: Event interrupts the subject’s normal daily activities and generally requires systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.

CONFIDENTIAL  3 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Number:  
SCT-MD-60 
Title:  
A R
andomized, Mult icenter, D ouble -Blind, Flexibly -dosed, Efficacy and Safety Study of Escitalopram in 
the Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Generalized Anxiety Disorder  
Investigational Product : 
Escitalopra
m 
Study Centers:  
Approximately 40 centers in the United Stat es 
Phase:  
Phase 3  
Objectives: 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of escitalopram relative to placebo 
in the acute 
treatment of children (aged 7 through 11 years) and adolescents (aged 12 through 17 years) 
who meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5).  
The secondary objective of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic  (PK) profile 
 of escitalopram 
in the pe diatric population (aged 7 through 17 years).  
The exploratory objective of this study is to assess the exposure/dos e-response relationship.  
Study Design:  
This is a randomized, multicenter, double -blind, flexib ly-dosed, placebo- controlled parallel group stu dy.  
During the coronaviru s disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, remote study visits are possible to avoid 
missing efficacy data, but not preferred  over clinic visits .  
Number of Subjects:  
Approximately 430 subjects w ill be screened and a total of approximately 256 subjects are planned to be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either escitalopram or placebo.  The randomization schedule will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_81450] (grouped as 7– 11 years vs. 12– 17 years) and sex, and blocked.  The sample size 
may be increased based on the outcome of a blinded interim analysis but the number of subjects in each treatment arm will be capped at  160. 
Treatment:  
Subjects will begin with a 10 mg/day dose of escitalopram (taken orally) or matching placebo for the first 
2 weeks of doubl 
e-blind treatment. At the end of Week 2, subjects who can tolerate the current dose of 
10 mg/day may have a dose escalation to 20  mg/day of escitalopram or matching placebo. Dose 
escalation will be at the investigator’s discretion taking into account the Clinical Global Impression of 
Severity (CGI -S) score. Subjects who remain on the 10 mg/day dose of escitalopram or matching placebo 
will be evaluated again at Week 4 for a possible dose escalation to 20 mg/day at the investigator’s discretion .
 The dose  may be decreased from 20 mg/day to 10 mg/day following discussion with the 
medical director if the subject does not tolerate the 20 mg/day dose.  
Study Duration:  
The study design incorporates an up to 3-week screening period, an [ADDRESS_980865]-MD -60 Version  3.0 Final Page  5 of 99

PARS sever
ity score.  
The PARS severity score for GAD is assessed for all symptoms identified in the generalized anxiety 
section of  th
e PARS symptom checklist. The PARS severity score for GAD will be derived by [CONTACT_10618] 
5 of 7 severity/impairment/interference items (2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 ). 
Secondary Endpoints:  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
• Response rate on the PARS at acute treatment endpoint (Week 8)

CONFIDENTIAL  6 INTRODUCTION 
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of t he most frequently occ urring childhood 
anxiety disorders1. In the [LOCATION_002], an estimated 2.2% of adolescents (aged 13 
through 18 years) had GAD, with  an estima ted 0.9% having severe impairment  based 
on data published in 2010. The prevalence of GAD among adolescents was higher for 
females (3.0%) than for males (1.5%)2. 
An anxiety disorder such as GAD in children and adolescents increases the risk for 
substance abuse and suicida
l ideation and suicide attempts, and also increases the risk 
for anxiety or depressive disorders in adulthood3,4,5. However, anxiety disorders are 
often untreated  in children and adolescents6.  
There is increasing evidence to suggest that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) are effective
 treatments for you th with GAD and are generally well tolerated7. 
Escitalopram, the S -enantiomer of racemic ci talopram, is an SSRI  primarily responsible 
for the serotonin reuptake inhibition produced by [CONTACT_718784]. Escitalopram binds preferentially to the serotonin transporter and has very low or no affinity for neurotransmitter receptors or for the dopamine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_156121]. T he 
mechanism of antidepressant action of escitalopram  is presumed to be linked to 
potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from its inhibition of central nervous system  neuronal reuptake of serotonin 
(5-hydroxytryptamine).  
Five clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in adult patients 
with GAD have been completed
. Three of the 5 studies were placebo -controlled; one 
was an open -label extension study; and one was a relapse-prevention study. The 
efficacy of escitalopram in the acute treatment of GAD was demonstrated in the three, 8-week, flexible -dose, placebo- controlled studies. In all 3 studies, escitalopram  showed 
statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. Results from the relapse-prevention study showed that treatment with 
escitalopram at 20  mg/day significantly reduced the risk of relapse of GAD. 
The most commonly observed adverse reactions in the placebo- controlled double -blind 
studies
 in adult escitalopram patients (incidence of approximately 5% or greater and 
approximate ly twice the incidence in placebo patients) were nausea, ejaculation disorder 
(primarily ejaculatory delay), insomnia, fatigue, decreased libido, and anorgasmia. 
Escitalopram has not been evaluated in pediatric p atients in clinical studies in GAD. In 
pediatric patients (aged 6 through 17 years) in studies in major depressive disorder 
(MDD), the overall profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that seen in adult studies. However, the following adverse reactions were reported at an incidence of at least 2% for escitalopram and greater than placebo: back pain, urinary tract infection, vomiting, and nasal congestion.

CONFIDENTIAL  The single- and multiple -dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of escitalopram are linear and 
dose- proportional in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/da y. The mean terminal half -life is 
about 27 to 32 hours. Following a single oral dose (20 mg tablet or solution) of 
escitalopram, peak blood levels occur at about [ADDRESS_980883] subjects
8. 
In a single-dose study of 10 mg escitalopram, the area under the plasma concentration -time cur 
ve (AUC) of escitalopram decreased by 19%, and the maximum 
plasma concentration (Cmax) increased by 26% in health y adolescent subjects (12 to 
17 years of age) compared to adults8. Following multiple dosing of 40 mg/day 
citalopram, steady state Cmax and AUC were similar  in adolescent patients with MDD 
(12 to 17 years of age) compared to adult patients8.  
Escitalopram is approved in the [LOCATION_002] (under the trade name [CONTACT_718823]®) for the 
acute and maintenance treatment of MDD in adults (aged 18 through 65 years) and 
adolescents (aged 12 through 17 years) and the acute treatment of GAD in adults at once-daily doses of 10 to 20 mg. Outside the [LOCATION_002],  escitalopram is approved for 
the treatment of MDD, GAD, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social 
anxiety disorder  under the trade names Cipralex

CONFIDENTIAL  8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description  
This is a random
ized, multicenter, double-blind, flexibly-dosed, placebo-controlled 
parallel gr
oup study of escitalopram  in the treatment of children (aged 7 through 
11 years ) and adolescent s (aged 12 through 17 years ) with GAD. 
The study design incorporates an up to 3- week screening p eriod, an 8- week  double-
blind, acute treatment period, and a 1-week double -blind down taper period. 
Approximately 430 subjects will be screened and a total of appro ximately 256 subjects 
are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either escitalopram or placebo. The 
randomization schedule will be stratified by [CONTACT_81450] (grouped as 7-11 years vs. 12–17 years) and sex, and blocked. 
Subjects will begin with a 10 mg/day dose of escitalopram (taken oral ly) or mat
 ching 
placebo for the first 2 we eks of double- blind treatment. At the end of Week 2, subjects 
who can tolerate the current dose of 10 mg/day may have a dose escalation  to 
20 mg/day  of escitalopram or matching placebo. Dose escalation will be at the 
investigator’s discretion taking into account the Clinical Global Impression of Severity 
(CGI -S) score. Subjects who remain on the 10 mg/day dose of escitalopram or matching 
placebo will be evaluated again at Week 4 for a possible dose escalation to 20 mg/day at the investigator’s discretion . Dose escalations cannot be made at any other time during 
the study. The dose may be decreased from 20 mg/day to 10 mg/day following discussion with the medical director  if the subject does not tolerate the 20 mg/day dose. 
At the end of the treatment period or at early withdrawal, subjects will enter a 1-week 
double-blind down taper period with a follow-up telephone contact 1 week after the end 
of the double-blind down taper period. 
A blinded interim analysis will be conducted when 75% of randomized subjects have 
either comple t
ed or discontinued the study in order to check the assumptions in the 
sample size calculation. Based on this, the sa mple size may be increased to ensure an 
adequate power. However, due to the difficulties in recruiting pediatric subjects with GAD, the number of subjects in each treatment arm will be capped at 160.  
The study design is shown in Figure 1. 
The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) pandemi
 c (and any other naming 
conventions used) developed after this study began and this protocol has been amended to account for study procedures that need to be modified in association with adhering to local safety guidelines or regulations.  
During the COVID -19 pandemic, r
 emote study visits, in which data are collected via 
telephone or videoconference, are possible but not preferred. Nearly all scheduled safety 
assessments, with exceptio n of the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS),

in order to assess safety and efficacy in this patient population. 
In order to standardize the subject population and to make it as homogeneous as 
possible, all subjects mu
st meet the DSM -[ADDRESS_980896] in t his indication9 so this study will use  a parallel -group 
design  with a placebo -control arm . As some of the endpoints (eg, saf ety, clinical 
assessments) are potentially subjective, this study will be performed in a double-blind 
manner.  
Subjects randomized to the escitalopram treatment arm will rece ive escitalopram at an 
initia
l dose of 10 mg/day with the possibility to increase the dose to 20 mg /day after 
[ADDRESS_980897] within this period and the efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of 
GAD beyond 8 weeks has not been systematically studied. T he study includes a 1-week 
double-blind down taper period at the End of T reatment to minimize symptoms 
associated  with discontinuation of escitalopram . 
Analyses of short- term placebo -controlled t rials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and 
others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal ideation  and behavior 
(suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged 18 through 24  years ) with 
MDD and other psychiatric disorders. In order to monitor this, the C- SSRS will be 
completed at the Screening, Baseline, and each study visit (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for 
further details) .

following 
processes will be implemented: 
• Exclusion of subjec ts whose anxiety is sig nificantly impacted by [CONTACT_4113]-19 as 
assessed by [CONTACT_1697] (see Section  8.3.3).  
• Global COVID -[ADDRESS_980901] assessment (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
• Visit conduct options allowing remote visits as outlined below: 
During remote study v
isits data are collected via telephone or videoconference 
(see Appendix 17.3).  
Any clinic
al assessment (including physical examinatio n, vital signs, urine, or 
blood test
s) necessary as part of evaluation of a reported adverse event (AE) must 
be performed immediately. If the study site is closed or the subject is unable to travel to the study site, alternate arrangements for in -person cl inical assessment 
should be secured. 
Option 1: In -Clinic Visits  
This is the preferred option. All study visits are performed as in -clinic visits with all 
assessments outlined in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 8.1.2.  
Option 2: Remote Visits (except Screening  for all subjects and Baseline Visit for female 
subjects of childbearing potential )  
This option is only to be used if local guidance and regulations are preventing the site or subject from completing  an in-clinic  visit. Screening must take place as an in -clinic visit 
with all assessments outlined in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 8.1.2. The 
Baseline Visit must t 
ake place as an in -clinic visit for all female subjects of childbearing

(128 per treatment arm) are planned to be randomized in approximately 40 centers in 
the U nited States. It is assumed that approximately 115 subjects per treatment arm will 
be evaluable (ie, have at least one postbaseline assessment).  
A blinded interim analysis will be conducted when 75% of randomized subjects have 
either complete d or disconti
nued the study in order to check the assumptions in the 
sample size calculation. Based on this, the sample size may be increased to ensure an adequate power  due to variance assumption deviation as well as increased variance due

E is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
administered a
 medicinal product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product. This includes an exacerbation of pre -existing 
conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the eCRF under specific efficacy assessments . Anticipated fluctuations of pre-existing conditions, 
including the disease under study that do not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the 
study. AEs w ill 
be elicited by [CONTACT_63397] a nonleading question, for example, 
“Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?” . AEs should be reported on t he appropriate page of the eCRF.

CONFIDENTIAL  Assessment of Severity  
Each AE will be assigned a category by [CONTACT_3470]: 
Mild : An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort 
and does not interfere with everyday activities.  
Moderate : An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfer e with normal 
everyday activities; intervention may be needed.  
Severe : An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually needed.  
If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.  
Assessment of C ausality 
Eve
ry effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, 
to the study dru
g. Causality should be assessed using the categories presented in the 
following table:  
Unrelated : Clinical event with an incomp atible time relationship to study drug  
administration, and that could be explained by [CONTACT_239680]. 
Unlikely : Clinical event whose time relationship to study drug  admin istration 
makes a causal connection improbable, but that could plausibly be 
explained by [CONTACT_91336].  
Possible : Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study drug  
administration, but that could also be expl ained by [CONTACT_64758].  
Probable : Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study drug  
administration, and is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease 
or other drugs or chemicals.  
Very 
Likely/Certain : Clinical event with plausible time relationship to study drug  
administration, and that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_63400].

 ecautions  
Clinical Worsening/Suicide Risk: s ubjects should be m onitored for clinical worsening, 
suicidality and unusual change in behavior, especially at the start of therapy or at times 
of dose changes . (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for use of the C- SSRS).  
Serotonin Sy
ndrome: serotonin syndrome has been reported with SS RIs, including 
esci
talopram , when taken alone, but especially when co -administered with other 
serotonergic agents (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331], amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort). Serotonin 
syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (eg, agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (eg, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, and hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (eg, tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and incoordination) seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). If symptoms of 
serotonin syndrome occur, es citalopram should be discontinued and supportive 
treatment initiated.  
Hyponatremia: hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs, including escitalopram . Subj
ects taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at 
greater risk. D iscontinuation of escitalopram should be considered in subjects with 
symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. 
Caution should be used when escitalopram is taken in combination with other centrally 
acting drugs
.

will be performed for all continuous efficacy parameters. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary e
fficacy endpoint is the change from B aseline to Week [ADDRESS_980971]. The PARS severity score 
for GAD will be derived by [CONTACT_10618] 5 of 7 severity/impairment/interference items (2, 3, 5, 6, and 7). 
The primary analysis will be performed using an MMRM with treatment gro up, age 
group strat
a (7-11 vs. 12-17 years), sex, study center, visit, and treatment group- by-visit 
interaction as the fixed effects and the baseline value and baseline value -by-visit 
interaction as the covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of within -subject scores. The Kenward -Roger approximation
16 will be 
used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom for the unstructured covariance matrix. If the model convergence for the unstructured covariance matrix fails, then the 
Fisher scoring algorithm will be used to provide better initial values of the covariance parameters . In the event that the model still does not converge after using those initial 
values, simplified covariance structures will be used to fit the model in the following order until the model converges: (1) ante-dependence, (2) heterogeneous autoregressive, (3) Toeplitz, and (4) compound symmetry. If a structured covariance is used, then a robust sandwich es timator will be used for estimating the variance of  the treatment 
effect estimate.

ithout imputation of missing values.  
The significance test for the diffe rence in means at  Week [ADDRESS_980972]

CONFIDENTIAL  o Remission rate on CGI- S at acute treatment endpoint (Week 8). 
Remission rate is defined as the percentage of subjects having a CGI -S 
score ≤2 at endpoint.  
• Change on the CGAS from baseline to acute treatment en dpoint (Week 8) 
o
 Remission rate on the CGAS at acute treatment endpoint ( Week 8). 
Funct
ional remission is defined as CGAS >70. 
• COVID -[ADDRESS_980976] as sessment score at each visit . 
The response rate of the PARS will be analy zed using a repe ated measures model for  
categorical outcomes. Modeling will be completed  using a categorical MMRM 
(MMRM-CAT) approach, in which a pseudo-likelihood- based repeated measures 
analysis will be used and implemented in SAS procedure GLIMMIX. A binary 
distribution with logit link will be used for the dependent variable. Classification 
variables for treatment, age group, sex, visit (as a categorical variable), 
treatment -by-age group interaction, treatment- by-sex interaction, treatment -by-visit 
interaction, and treatment -by-age group -by-sex interaction, and baseline score as a 
covariate will be considered in the modeling. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Analysis o f Remission in PARS  
The remission rate on the PARS will be analyz ed using t he same MMRM- CAT as the 
response rate on the PARS.  [IP_ADDRESS].2 Change on the CGI -S from Basel
 ine to Acute Treatment Endpoint 
(Week  8) 
The change in the CGI -S will be analy z ed using the same methodology described for 
the primary efficacy endpoint. The analysis of the remission rate for the CGI- S will use 
the same methodology described for the analysis  of the response rate on the PARS.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Change on the CGAS from Baseline to Acute Treatment Endpoint 
(Week  8)  
The ch
ange in the CGAS will be analy zed using the s ame methodology described for 
the primary efficacy endpoint. The analysis of the remission rate for the CGAS will use the same methodology described for the analysis of the response rate on the PARS.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_980977] will be used as the baseline for all analyses of that safety parameter.  
Safety data collected outside of planned visit windows but within allowance limits (up to 1 week late f
or Visits  7 and 8) will be  included in the summary tables. Safety data 
collected outside of planned visit windows and outside of the allowance limits (>1  week 
to 6 weeks late for Visits  7 and 8) will be listed, but will not be in cluded in the summary 
tables. Subgroup analyses may be performed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the safety analyses.  
The safety endpoints during the double-blind treatment period are as follows: 
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adve
 rse events  (TEAEs) . 
• Observed values and change from baseline in vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, tempera 
ture, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2844], height, weight, BMI, height percentile, weight 
percentile, and BMI percentile) ; incidence of vital sign potentially clinically 
significant ( PCS) values.  
• Observed values and changes from baseline in ECG  intervals a nd interpretation; 
incidence of ECG PCS values.  
• Observed values and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, 
chemistry, and urinalysis); incidence of clinical laboratory PCS 
values.  
• Incidence of suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior as determined by [CONTACT_941] 
C-SSRS.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse E
vents  
AEs will be c

AE (classified
 by [CONTACT_6214]) not present before t he date of the first dose of  the double-blind 
treatment period or during the double-blind down taper period or that was present 
before the first dose but increased in severity or seriousness will be considered a TEAE. An AE that starts more than [ADDRESS_980978] will not be counted as a TEAE. 
An AE that starts  during the double-
 blind down taper period or that increases in severity 
or seriousness during the double-blind down taper period will be considered a newly 
emergent AE  (NEAE) . The NE AEs during the double-blind down taper period will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_2946] , PT, and treatment group for all subject s who enter the 
double-blind down taper period.

and potentially safety parameters and plasma exposure will be explored using a 
nonlinear mixed effects approach. The analysis results will be provided in a separate report.  
11.8 Interim Analyses  
A blinded interim analy
sis will be conducted when 75% of randomized subjects have 
either completed or dis
continued the study to obtain an estimate of the pooled standard 
deviation on change from baseline in the PARS score to Week [ADDRESS_980985] deviation in the sample size calculation due to assumption deviation as 
well as COVID -19 remote visits  (see Section  11.9 ), sample sizes in placebo and 
escitalopram treatment g 
roups may be increased to ensure an adequate power. However, 
due to the difficulties in recruiting pediatric subjects with GAD, the number of subjects in each treatment arm will be capped at 160.  
11.9 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size estimat
e was constructed using a simulation approach as described in 
Lu K. (2012)18.  
The primary efficacy parameter will be the change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_980986] size (treatment 
group difference of 2.[ADDRESS_980987] deviation of 5.7919) of 0.39, a 
sample size of 128 subjects in the escitalopram treatment group and 128 subjects in the placebo group will provide 85% power based on an MMRM model using simulation

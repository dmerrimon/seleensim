CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis  
Title:   Open Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Etanercept Treatment in Subjects With 
Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Who Have Failed Therapy With Apremilast  
Study Phase:   4 
Indication:  Plaque Psoriasis (PsO)  
Primary Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy of etanercept at week 12 as measured by a 75% 
improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) in adult subjects with moderate to 
severe plaque PsO who have failed therapy with apremilast (Otezla) 
Secondary Objective s:  To evaluate the effect of treatment with etanercept on other efficacy 
endpoints (PASI, Static Physician ’s Global Assessment [sPGA], Body Surface Area [BSA]) , and 
patient reported outcomes (PRO), including Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) , Patient 
Assessment of Treatment Satisfaction, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
Safety Objective:   To evaluate the safety and tolerability of etanercept in apremilast failures   
Hypotheses:   A formal hypothesis will not be tested in this study.   This study will estimate the 
proportion of subjects with PsO who achieve a PASI [ADDRESS_82181].  
Primary Endpoint:  PASI 75 at week 12  
Secondary Endpoints:   
• PASI 75 at all other visits  
• PASI 50 and 90 at all visits  
• Percent PASI improvement at all visits  
• sPGA of 0 or 1 at all visits  
• sPGA of 0, 1, or 2 at all visits  
• sPGA at all visits  
• One and two grade improvement in sPGA at all visits  
• Percent BSA improvement at all visits  
• PSI and  component scores at all visits  
• Patient Assessment of Treatment Satisfaction at week 12 and 24  
• Improvement in DLQI at week 12 and 24  
Safety Endpoints: 
• Adverse  events  
• Laboratory assessments  
Study Design:  This is a multicenter, open- label, single- arm, phase 4, estimation study in 
subjects with PsO who have failed apremilast.  Approximately [ADDRESS_82182] 10 subjects (and not to exceed 20) will be enrolled for reasons of intolerability to apremilast in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The remaining [ADDRESS_82183] in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 45 days, a 24- week treatment period with 
study visi ts every 4 -weeks,  and a 30- day follow -up period for safety. Etanercept dosing will follow 
the recommended label dosing for subjects with PsO.  
Sample Size:   Approximately [ADDRESS_82184] Eligibility Criteria: The study seeks to enroll male and female subjects    
(≥ 18 years of age)  with moderate to severe plaque PsO defined by [CONTACT_47735] ≥ 10%, sPGA ≥ 3, and 
PASI ≥ [ADDRESS_82185]:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  [ADDRESS_82186]:   Etanercept will be supplied in a single- use prefilled 1.0 mL syringe as 
a sterile, clear and color less, preservative- free solution for subcutaneous injection.   Each 
single- use prefilled syringe contains 0.98 mL of 50 mg/mL etanercept . Etanercept will be provided 
with  [ADDRESS_82187] Dosage and Administration:  Etanercept dosing will follow the 
recommended label dosing for patients with PsO: 50 mg subcutaneously  twice weekly for 
12 weeks followed by 50 mg once weekly for the additional 12 weeks.   
Procedures:   Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects  before any screening 
procedures are performed. The following procedures will occur per the Schedule of Assessments:  
medical and medication history, physical exam, vital signs, height and weight, tuberculosis 
testing, hepatitis testing, urinalysis, assessment of the sPGA score, PASI score and assessment 
of involved BSA. Blood samples will be collected for hematology, chemistry, and for all females  
(except those who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_75574], 
or who are at least 2 years postmenopausal)  to conduct a serum pregnancy test. The treatment 
period will be [ADDRESS_82188] dose of etanercept . The 
following procedures will be performed at baseline (day 1) and during the treatment period: 
interim physical  exam, vital signs , weight  , PASI, B SA, sPGA, blood samples, urinalysis (day 1 
only) and urine pregnancy tests when required per schedule of assessments.  PROs  will be 
collected at day [ADDRESS_82189] dose of etanercept , subjects will receive a final 
safety  follow -up phone call to confirm the status of any ongoing and/or new disease related 
events or serious adverse events . The overall study design is described by a study schema  at the 
end of this synopsis section . For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each 
procedure, please refer to Section 7 and the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ).   
Statistical Considerations:  This is an open- label single -arm study. Ninety five percent 
confidence intervals and p- values for estimated response rates will be generated for descriptive 
purposes only. The full analysis set includes all subjects who received at least one dose of  
investigational product during the study. All safety and efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the full analysis set. For the primary analysis of all efficacy endpoints, missing efficacy data will  
be imputed using last observation carried forward method. A sensitivity analysis will be performed 
using observed cases . There will be no interim analysis.  
For a full description of statistical analysis methods, refer to Section 10.

CONFIDENTIAL    1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary 
To evaluate the efficacy of etanercept at week 12 as measured by a 75% improvement 
in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque (PsO)  who have failed therapy with apremilast (Otezla

reported outcomes (PRO), including Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI),  Patient 
assessment of Treatment Satisfaction, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) . 
1.[ADDRESS_82202]  failures.  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease 
PsO is a chronic, often severe,  autoimmune dermatologic condition that affects 
approximately 2% of the world’s population (Menter et al, 2008) . Moderate to severe 
plaque PsO  is, for most patients, a chronic, life- long condition.  Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_75575] (eg, corticosteroids, vitamin D3), phototherapy, oral systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(eg, apremilast, methotrexate, cyclosporine)  and biologics (eg, etanercept, i nfliximab, 
adalimumab, ustekinumab and secukinumab). Many patients nevertheless remain 
untreated, fail to respond or lose response to therapy over time, or suffer from toxicities 
associated with systemic medication or phototherapy.  
2.[ADDRESS_82203] (OTEZLA) Background 
Apremilast is an oral small -molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) specific for 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels. The specific mechanism(s) by [CONTACT_75591] s 
therapeutic action in psoriasis patients is not well defined. OTEZLA
 (apremilast) is 
indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque PsO who are 
candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Refer to the specific section of the 
product label for additional information.  
The safety of apremilast was assessed in [ADDRESS_82204]:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  [ADDRESS_82205] 5 days.  Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 83 years, with an overall median age of 46 years.  Diarrhea (17%), nausea (17%), and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (9%) were the most commonly reported adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for subjects taking apremilast were nausea 
(1.6%), diarrhea (1.0%), and headache (0.8 %). The proportion of subjects with psoriasis 
who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction was 6.1% for subjects treated 
with apremilast 30 mg twice daily and 4.1% for placebo- treated subjects. Severe 
worsening of psoriasis (rebound) occurred in 0.3% (4/1184) subjects following 
discontinuation of treatment with apremilast ( Otezla
 prescribing information, 2014 ). 
Two multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trials (Studies PSOR -1 
and PSOR -2) enrolled a total of 1257 subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate 
to severe plaque PsO.  Study PSOR -1 enrolled 844 subjects and Study PSOR -2 
enrolled 413 subjects. In both studies, subjects were randomized 2:1 to O tezla  30 mg 
BID or placebo for 16 weeks. Clinical Response at Week 16 in t he PSOR -1 and PSOR -2 
studies was as follows:  
• PSOR -1 
- 33.1% achieved PASI [ADDRESS_82206] vs. 5.3% with placebo 
- 21.7% achieved sPGA clear (0) or almost clear (1) with apremilast vs. 3.9% with 
placebo 
• PSOR -2 
- 28.8% achieved PASI [ADDRESS_82207] vs. 5.8% with placebo 
- 20.4% achieved sPGA clear (0) or almost clear (1) with apremilast vs. 4.4% with placebo 
2.[ADDRESS_82208] Background :  Etanercept  
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal 
inflammatory  and immune responses. It plays a role in the inflammatory process of PsO.  
Elevated levels of TNF are found in involved tissues and fluids of patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and PsO. Two distinct receptors for TNF, a 55 kilodalton (kD) protein (p55) and a 75 kD protein (p75), exist 
naturally as monomeric molecules on cell surfaces and in soluble forms. Biological activity of TNF is dependent upon binding to either cell surface TNF receptor.  
Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand -binding 
portion of the human [ADDRESS_82209]:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  5 February 2016   Page 14 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL    immunoglobulin G1. Etanercept inhibits binding of TNF- α and TNF -β (lymphotoxin alpha 
[LT-α]) to cell surface  TNF receptors, rendering TNF biologically inactive.  
Etanercept is indicated in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of : 1) moderately to 
severely active RA 2) moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis in patients aged 2 and older; 3) psoriatic arthritis; 4) active ankylosing 
spondylitis; and, 5) adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque PsO who are 
candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. 
Refer to the specific section of the Investigator’s Brochure , or th e product label for 
additional information related to the physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties 
and formulation(s).  
2.[ADDRESS_82210] 10 subjects (and not to exceed 20) will be enrolled for reasons of 
intolerability to apremilast in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The remaining [ADDRESS_82211]:  Etanercept

treatment period with study visits every 4 weeks and a 30 -day follow -up period for 
safety. Etanercept dosing will follow the recommended label dosing for patients with plaque PsO.  
The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of the 
protocol  synopsis  section.  
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1 . 
3.2 N umber of Sites 
Approximately 20 sites in North America  will participate in this study.  Sites that do not 
enroll subjects within 3 months of site initiation may be closed.   
3.3 Number of Subjects  
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.  Approximately 
[ADDRESS_82213] dose of etanercept.  
3.5.2 End of Study  
The end of study (end of trial) is defined as  the time when the last subject is assessed or 
receives an intervention for evaluation in the study . 
4. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study 
candidates that includes lim ited information about the potential candidate (eg, date of 
screening).  This log may be completed and updated via an Interactive Voice Response 
(IVR)/Interactive Web Response (IWR) system.  
Before any  study-specific activities/ procedure, the appropriate w ritten informed consent

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, [COMPANY_010] 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board/ independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC ) approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other 
subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2).  All 
subjects must personally sign and date the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_010] approved informed 
consent form before commencement of study -specific activit ies/procedures.  
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The investigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form ( CRF). 
Each subject who enter s into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at 
which the subject signs the informed consent form) receives a unique subject 
identification number before any study -related activit ies/procedures are performed.  The 
subject identification number will be assigned  by [CONTACT_75595]/IWR system. This number will be 
used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study 
documentation related to that subject.  Subjects who are unable to complete or meet 
eligibility on initial screening will be permitted to re -scree n twice (see Section 7.2.2 ). 
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is rescreened.

7.5 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table  1) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests out lined i n the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data  throughout the course of the study .  This can also 
include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality.    
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423],  [COMPANY_010] can  do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the 
inflammatory conditions , the dose response and/or prediction of response to etanercept , 
and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  
Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily 
reported as part of this study.  Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_82280]’s 
medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, members of the family, 
the personal physician, or other third parties , except as specified in the informed 
consent.  
The subject retains the rig ht to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_21947] .  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.   
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed.   
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be 
retained by [CONTACT_11337].

CONFIDENTIAL    The sp onsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator , at the end of the storage period, or as  
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no longer justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_21878]).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information,

8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_8018]. 
Subject s (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21880] .  If this occurs, the 
investiga tor is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation 
from investigational product or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21881] t he options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ) and 
collection of data, including endpoints and adverse events .  The investigator  must 
document the change to the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1) and the level of 
follow -up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_423] ( eg, in person, by [CONTACT_756]/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records ).   
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish t o receive 
further protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882] , and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation .  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Definition of Safety Events 
9.1.1 Disease Related Events 
Disease Related Events are events (serious or non- serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease.  Disease related events for the purposes 
of this study include worsening of the skin symptoms associated with PsO.  Such events 
do not meet the definition of an Adverse Event unless assessed to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.  
 
  Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  5 February 2016  Page 39 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL    Disease Related Events and/or Disease Related Outcomes that do not qualify as 
Serious Adverse Events:  
• An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study (eg, disease 
progression in oncology or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44814]) is to be 
reported as a Disease Related Event.  
• Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the Event CRF.  
If the outcome of the underlying disease is worse than that which would normally be 
expected for the subject, or if the investigator  believes there is a causal relationship 
between the investigational product(s)/study treatment  protocol required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_75586], this must  be reported as an Adverse Event or  Serious Adverse 
Event.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_82284]’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre -existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease (eg, 
diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration more than would be expected , and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome  than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study , 
is not considered an adverse event.   
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insuffic ient or inadequate  
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or  
adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device.   
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative request s to withdraw from protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33206] , refer to Section 8.[ADDRESS_82285]:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  20150252  
Date:  [ADDRESS_82286] 1 of the 
following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a Disease Related Event as 
defined in Section 9.1.1 ): 
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• require s in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
A disease related event as described above is to be reported as a serious adverse event 
if:  
• the subject’s pre -existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would 
consider typi[INVESTIGATOR_21885] a patient with the same underlying condition, or 
• if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the investigational 
medicinal product(s)/protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_75587] ,  
• and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria above.  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”,  if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “o ther medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency 
room visit , outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.

9.2.2 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria 
The investigator  is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_75604]. 
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms), 
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) , 
• Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol],  
• Assessment of relatedness to etanercept , and 
• Action taken  
The adverse event grading scale used will be t he Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.   The grading scale used in this study is described 
in Appendix  A.  The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly 
related t o the investigational product.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” 
response to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by  [CONTACT_7198] ?   
If the severity of an adverse event changes  from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Adverse Event Summary CRF.  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.

Date:  [ADDRESS_82290] ed to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
[CONTACT_75605] 30- day safety follow -up period are recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and are submitted to [COMPANY_010].   All serious adverse events must be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event 
via the Event CRF.   
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to any study -mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity/procedure”?  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization or reversibility.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] via an electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event 
Worksheet /electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  For EDC 
studies  where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to [COMPANY_010] via 
the eSerious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into 
the EDC system when the system is again available.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be submitted to [COMPANY_010].   All new information f or serious adverse events must be sent to 
[COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_82291] be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
[COMPANY_010] will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs

clinical practice .  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse event reports received from [COMPANY_010], in accordance with local procedures and statutes.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required 
Reporting Period  
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study.  However, these serious 
adverse events can be reported to [COMPANY_010].  In some countries (eg, European Union 
member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become aware of after end of study.  If serious adverse events are reported, the 
investigator is to report them  to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.  
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the  purposes of expedit ed 
reporting.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events That Are not to be Reported In an 
Expedited Manner  
The study population involved will have an increased burden of comorbidities which are commonly associated with psoriasis  and may lead to serious adverse events that do not 
need to be reported in an expedited manner.  This includes any serious adverse event attributed to hypertension, obesity, type [ADDRESS_82292]:  Etanercept

the investigator’s knowledge of the event  of a pregnancy .  Report a pregnancy on the 
Pregnancy Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  C).   
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_75589].  
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for 
lactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] 
4 weeks after the end of treatment with etanercept.  
Any lactation case should be reported to [COMPANY_010]’s Global Patient Safety within 24 hours  
of the investigator’s knowledge of event .  Report a lactation case on the Lactation 
Notification Worksheet (Appendix  C).

10.1.3 Covariates and Subgroups 
The following predictors and subgroup  analyses may be performed  to assess their 
influence on the primary endpoint:  
• Body mass index  (≤ 35 kg/m2  or > 35 kg/m2) 
• Body Weight  (≤ median, > median)  
• Age (<65, ≥ 65) 
• Gender (male vs.  female)  
• Race (white, non -white ) 
• Ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, Non- Hispanic or Latino)  
• Baseline PASI score ( ≤ median, > median)  
• Baseline BSA with psoriasis involvement (%) ( ≤ median, > median)  
• History of psoriatic arthritis (yes, no)  
• Baseline sPGA sc ore (3, 4 or 5)  
10.[ADDRESS_82294].   
In recent etanercept studies, the 12- week PASI 75 response rate for etanercept was 
~50 to 60%.  The assumed response for a population with failure of treatment with 
apremilast is 40%.  In placebo- controlled phase 3 studies, the PASI 75 placebo 
response rate was ~5% in subjects with moderate to severe plaque PsO.  Therefore, in 
this single -arm study if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the proportion 
of PASI 75 response is above 10%, we can safely conclude that in spi[INVESTIGATOR_75590] 
a single -arm study (i e, regression to the mean and/or placebo effect), the etanercept 
effect is real.  
The sample size of 80 is more than adequate to achieve a half -width of less than 15% 
for the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of subjects who achieve a PASI 75 
response, assuming a sample proportion of 40% and a lower bound of the confidence interval above 10%.

CONFIDENTIAL    In this study, the IVR/IWR  system captures the following data points and these are 
considered source data:   subject ID,  enrollment date, investigational product 
dispensation date and investigational product box number dispensed.  
CRF entries may be considered source data if the CRF is the site of the original 
recording (ie,  there is no other written or electronic record of data).  In this study, PROs  
noted in Schedule of Assessments  will be considered as source document.  
The Investigator  and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and 
centralized filing system of all study -related (essential) documentation, suitable for 
inspection at any time by [CONTACT_21972]/or applicable regulatory authorities.   
Elements to include:  
• Subject files containing completed CRFs , informed consent forms, and subject 
identification list  
• Study files containing t he protocol with all amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_21892], and all correspondence to and from the IRB/IEC  
and [COMPANY_010]  
• Investigational product -related correspondence including Proof of Receipts (POR ), 
Investigational Product Accountability Record(s) , Return of Investigational Product 
for Destruction Form(s), Final Investigational Product Reconciliation Statement , as 
applicable. 
• Non-investigational product(s) and or medical device(s) documentation, as 
applicable. 
In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the CRFs must be 
maintained and be readily available.  
Retention of study documents will be governed by [CONTACT_21973].  
12.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection  
The [COMPANY_010] representative(s) and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contact[CONTACT_21974], 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected.  
The [COMPANY_010] clinical m onitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  The clinical monitor is to have access to subject medical records and other 
study -related records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs.

CONFIDENTIAL    The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in 
completing CRFs, are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by [CONTACT_21975]’s Global R&D Compliance and Audit  (or 
designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy storage 
areas, laboratories) and review of study -related records will occur to evaluate the study 
conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available.  
• Updates to CRFs will be automatically document ed through the software’s “audit 
trail”.  
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at [COMPANY_010].  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resolution 
and subsequently closed by [CONTACT_53435].  
• The investigator  signs only the Investigator  Verification Form for this electronic data 
capture study or the investigator applies an electronic signature [CONTACT_75607].   This signature [CONTACT_75608], the data queries, and 
agrees with the content.  
[COMPANY_010] (or designee) will perform self -evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database, as documented in the Study Specific Self Evident Corrections 
Plan.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by [CONTACT_11337] (or designee) 
include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same date with different visit -week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).  Each investigative site will be provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the trial and at study closeout.   
12.4 Investigator  Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The investigator  is responsible for comply ing with the requirements for all assessments 
and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) as

Date:  [ADDRESS_82305] in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior 
to completion of all protocol- required visits and are unabl e or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ), the investigator can search publically available 
records [where permitted]) to ascertain survival status.  This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.   
12.[ADDRESS_82306], Reporting, Editing, and Publication of  
Scholarly Work in Medical Journals (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors , 
2013, updated 2014 ), which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the version to be published; (4) a greement to be accountable for all aspects of the work 
in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors  should meet conditions 1, 2, 3 
and 4. 
• When a large, multice nter group has conducted the work, the group should  identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or  general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should  have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.  
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] for review.  The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the inst itution, investigator , and [COMPANY_010] will detail the procedures for, 
and timing of, [COMPANY_010]’s review of publications.

Drug-induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of drug induced liver injury ( DILI), cases of 
concurrent AST or ALT and TBL and/or  INR elevation according to the criteria specified 
in Section Reporting  
6.2 require the following:  
• The event is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded) . 
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to the [COMPANY_010].  
Other  events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
All subjects in whom investigational product is withheld (either permanently or 
conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in Section Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
6.2.[ADDRESS_82309] or ALT elevations >  [ADDRESS_82310] are to undergo a period of “close 
observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels.  Assessments that are to be performed during t his period include:  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin  (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
• In cases of TBL > [ADDRESS_82311] or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR is to be performed every [ADDRESS_82312](s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic . 
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL:  
− Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for eosinophilia

CONFIDENTIAL    − Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti-nuclear antibody, Anti Smooth 
Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 to assess for 
autoimmune hepatitis  
− Obtain serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels  
− Obtain a more detailed history of:  
• Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness  
• Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
• Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypersensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever  
• Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets  
• Concomitant use of medications (including non -prescription medic ines and 
herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
− Obtain viral serologies  
− Obtain CPK, haptoglobin, LDH, and peripheral blood smear  
− Perform appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated  
• Obtain appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic  analysis if this has not 
already been collected  
• Obtain hepatology consult ( liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with an 
hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all laboratory 
abnormalities return to baseline or normal.  The “close observation period” is to 
continue for a minimum of [ADDRESS_82313](s) and protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding CRFs.

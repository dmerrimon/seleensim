October , [ADDRESS_895238] of administering half of survey modules every 2 weeks  versus 
all survey modules every 4 weeks on improving participants’ response rates. 
Methods  
We prepared the protocol  for this randomized factorial trial in compliance with the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_663150].gov . 
Study setting and Eligibility criteria  
Our randomized controlled trial will include participants of the electronic Framingham Heart 
Study (eFHS). Participants in eFHS  are invited to enroll from the FHS Offspring and Omni 
Group 1 Cohorts during the in- person examination 10/[ADDRESS_895239] to meet the additional following criteria: English -speaking 
individual who owns an iPhone with compatible iOS (version 10.0  or higher)  or Android (version 
5.0 or higher); residence in the [LOCATION_002]; provision of permissions for notifications and data 
sharing with the Research Center; provision of signed and dated informed consent (within the 
eFHS mobile app).  Enrollment in the randomized controlled trial will start once approved by [CONTACT_1744] . 
Surveys and Interventions  
All eFHS participants have the eFHS myDataHelps mobile app (developed by  [CONTACT_663153]) installed on their smartphone. The eFHS app allows 
communicat ion with participants through notifications and data collection . Participants are asked 
to answer  health surveys administered through the app.  
Survey assessments will include 6 modules: cognition, pain, mood, physical function  and 
performance , physical activity, and events  (table 1) . The interventions are defined by [CONTACT_663154] 2. The administration of the cognition, pain, mood, and psychosocial

these participants will contribute data only to the other survey modul es.

October , [ADDRESS_895243] the trial over 32 weeks .  
Outcomes  
We define 4 survey periods. Period 1 encompasses all survey modules administered from 
baseline up to week 8 ( 19 surveys/tasks per participant); period 2 from week 8 up to week 16  
(18 surveys/tasks per participant ); period 3 from week 16 up to week 24; period 4 from week 24  
(16 surveys/tasks per participant) .  
The primary outcome is  the proportion of survey s/task  returned per participant (partially or fully 
completed). The secondary outcome is the proportion of questions/task completed per participant. For both the primary and secondary outcomes, we will compare the mean proportions assessed longitudinally across the [ADDRESS_895244] s with the use of randomly permuted blocks of varying sizes, with stratification 
according to participant’s age (≤75 years vs. >75 years) and type of phone (android vs. iphone).  
Randomization w ill be implemented centrally  through the app.  
eFHS researchers and statistician  will be  masked to the group assignment . As part of eFHS, 
support staff help participants complete their remote monitoring and data transmission. The support staff us es standardized scripts to interact with participants  over the phone to address 
technical questions.  
Sample size  
We calculated the sample size for the comparison of the mean proportion of surveys returned between the two groups across time . We assumed consistent difference over time and that the 
eFHS  Offspring/Omni  Protocol  
October , [ADDRESS_895245] deviation on the proportion of survey returned of 20%. A sample size of 300 
participants per group guarantees 95% power to detect a mean difference of 5% between 
groups, for example between a mean of 50% of surveys returned per participants in the control 
group vs. a mean of 55% of surveys returned per participants in the experimental group.  
Statistical methods  
We will use a mixed -effects regression model to compare the mean proportions between groups 
across time. Analyses will be in intention- to-treat. We will fit random -intercept models as well 
random -intercept and random -trend models.  
We will perform the following a priori subgroup analyses. We will assess and compare the 
primary and secondary outcomes in subgroups defined according to age (> vs. ≤75 years), sex 
(female vs. male), type of phone (iphone vs. android), cognitive status (impaired or not) and whether participants have an apple watch or not. The cognition and gait tasks are currently not 
available on android phones.

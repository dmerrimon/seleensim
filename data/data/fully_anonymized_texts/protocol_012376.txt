1. OBJECTIVES  
 1.1 Study Design  
 
This is a Phase II,  single center study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ibrutinib 
(formerly PCI -[ZIP_CODE]) in previously untreated, symptomatic  Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia  
patients. Treatment will be administered in 4- week cycles to participants with WM, and 
particip ants will receive treatment until progression or upwards to [ADDRESS_783865]  of ibrutinib administered at 420 mg by [CONTACT_34048], with permitted dose 
modification for toxicity as per Table 6- 1. 
 
A Screening visit will be conducted within 30 days of Cycle 1, Day 1 of study drug administration. 
If the Screening visit and screening laboratories are done within 30 days of Cycle 1 , Day 1, then a 
separate visit and laboratories will not be required on Cycle 1, Day 1, and will be done only at the 
investigator’s discretion. At the Screening visit, a medical history will be obtained and a complete 
physical examination will be performed  including vital signs , and an ECOG performance status  
will be assessed .  A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752], and CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and 
pelvis will be done  during screening within 90 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 . Clinical laboratory 
tests in cluding a complete blood count plus differential, comprehensive chemistry panel 
(electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, albumin, total protein, total bilirubin, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), 
alkaline phosphatase), beta 2-microglobulin, serum and protein electrophoresis with quantification 
of immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, IgA) , serum free light chains, and immunofixation studies, 
peripheral flow cytometry lymphoma panel, coagulation panel and serum pregnancy tests for 
women of child- bearing potential will also be performed a t the Screening visit.  
 
Participants who meet the eligibility requirements as assessed at the Screening visit will be 
enrolled in the study and initiated on study drug. Participants will be evaluated for response and 
tolerability  on the first day of each c ycle (4 weeks ±  5 days ) at cycles 2  and 3, and thereafter every 
3 cycles (12 weeks ±  2 weeks ) for the duration of protocol therapy. Participants will be eligible to 
continue therapy so long as they do not demonstrate progressive disease , are non -responsive  and 
have  persistent symptoms,  or experience unacceptable toxicity. Modified r esponse criteria from  
2 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, [ADDRESS_783866] International Workshop on Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (Anderson et al, 2012)  
will be used to assess response, stable disease, and progressive disease according to S ection 9. 
Response outcomes to be determined will include the best overall  response rate (ORR) which 
includes m inor response s (MR), partial responses (PR), very good partial responses (VG PR) and 
complete responses (CR);  and best major  response rate which includes  PR, VGPR, and CR ; 
landmark analyse s for 2 and 4 year progression free survival; and median time to progress ion 
(TTP).  
 
1.2 Primary Objectives  
 
• To determine  major response rates  and best overall response rates  of ibrutinib in previously 
untreated and  symptomatic WM pa tients . 
 1.3 Secondary Objectives  
 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib in previously untreated and symptomatic 
WM patients . 
 
• Duration of response (DOR), time to response (TTR),  progression- free s urvival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) in previously untreated, and symptomatic WM patients. 
 
• To identify genomic variants associated with ibrutinib response, response duration and acquired resistance, including evolution of subclonal va riants present at baseline.  
 2. 
BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease (s) 
 Waldenström's  macroglobulinemia (WM) is a distinct clinicopathological entity of B lymphocytes 
that show maturation to plasma cells constituting a pathognomonic bone marrow  lymphoplasmacytic 
infiltrate, and synthesizing IgM (Waldenström, 1986). This condition is considered to correspond to 
the lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Owen et al, 2003) as defined by [CONTACT_38375] 
(WHO) classification systems ( Harris et al, 1999; Swerdlow et al, 2008). The disease was first 
reported by [CONTACT_594214]öm, who descri bed two patients with a high level of macroglobulin, i.e. 
pentameric immunoglobulin M (IgM), marked hyperviscosity with typi[INVESTIGATOR_594191] (Waldenström, 1944). Current frontline therapeutic options 
include  alkylator agents, proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, nucleoside analogues, alone 
3 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 and in combination ( Anderson et al, 2012; Dimopoulos et al, 2014).  Response rates are higher with 
combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (70- 90%), with median progression- free surv ival estimates of 2-[ADDRESS_783867] prolonged use and re -use of many of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594192]  (alkylators, nucleoside analogues), 
disease transformation (nucleosid e analogues), moderate to severe peripheral neuropathy 
(proteasome inhibitors), IgM flare leading to symptomatic hyperviscosity and IgM related morbidity (rituximab), depletion of uninvolved immunoglobulins leading to increased infection risk 
(proteasome i nhibitors, nucleoside analogues, rituximab), and immunosuppression (nucleoside 
analogues, al emtuzumab) ( Dimopoulos et al, 2014). Therefore, novel treatment options are urgently 
needed for use in the primary therapy of WM patients. 
 
Whole genome sequencing has revealed activating somatic mutations in MYD88 (L265P) and the 
C-terminal domain of CXCR4 in Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia  (Treon et al, 2012; Hunter et 
al, 2014). In tumor cells, MYD88
L265P triggers NFkB activation via two divergent pathways 
involvi ng Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and IRAK1/IRAK4 (Yang et al, 2013). Ibrutinib is an 
orally administered, small molecule inhibitor of BTK, which triggers apoptosis of MYD88L265P 
expressing Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia cell s (Yang et al, 2013).  Clinical activity was 
observed in a small subset of Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia patients in cluded  in a Phase I 
study of ibrutinib (Advani et al, 2013). Activating CXCR4 somatic mutations in Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinemia are similar to germline mutations foun d in WHIM (Warts, 
Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and M yelokathexis) syndrome patients (Hunter et al, 2013). 
At least 30 different CXCR4WHIM somatic mutations are present in Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinemia  (Treon et al, 2014) . Tumor cells engineered to express CXCR4WHIM mutations 
show enhanced activation of pro- survival factors AKT and ERK, and decreased in vitro  ibrutinib -
related apoptosis (Cao et al, 2014; Rocarro et al, 2014; Cao et al, 2015). 
A prospective, multicenter Phase II study examined the act ivity of ibrutinib in subjects with 
symptomatic WM disease who received at least  one prior therap y (Treon et al, 2015) . Ibrutinib 
(420 mg) was orally administered daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Sixty -three  
subjects  with a median of 2 (range 1- 9) prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , 40% of whom were refractory to their 
4 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, [ADDRESS_783868] -therapy , median serum IgM levels declined from 
3,520 to 880 mg/dL; hemoglobin rose from 10.5 to 13.8 g/dL, and bone marrow involvement 
declined from 60% to 25% (p<0.01 for all comparisons). Median response time was 4 weeks. 
Overall and major response rates were 9 0.5% and 73.0%, and were highest in patients with 
MYD88L265PCXCR4Wild -Type (WT) (100% and 91.2%), followed by [CONTACT_403447]88L265PCXCR4WHIM 
(85.7% and 61.9%), and MYD88WTCXCR4WT (71.4% and 28.6%). The 2 -year progression- free 
and overall survival rates for all patien ts were 69.1% and 95.2%, respectively. Overall toxicity was 
moderate in this study. Grade >2 treatment -related toxicities included neutropenia (22.2%) and 
thrombocytopenia (14.3%) that were more common in heavily pre -treated patients; post- procedure 
bleedi ng (3.2%)  prior to an amendment requiring hold on treatment for procedures ; epi[INVESTIGATOR_594193] (3.2%); and atrial fibrillation associated with previous 
arrhythmia history (3.2%)  which resolved after drug hold, and did not prevent restart of therapy. 
Serum IgA and IgG levels were unchanged, and treatment -related infections were infrequent. 
These findings led to a breakthrough designation, and full approval of ibrutinib by [CONTACT_941] U.S. FDA 
for use in symptomatic WM patients, and adopti on on NCCN guidelines. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_594194] (regardless of previous therapy status), there 
is no efficacy or safety data on the use of ibrutinib as primary therapy in WM.  
2.2 IBRUTINIB  
 
Ibrutinib  (formerly referred to as PCI -[ZIP_CODE]) is a selective, irreversible inhibitor of Bruton’s 
Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). The irreversible inhibitory effect of ibrutinib on BTK activity is attributed 
to an electrophilic group on the molecule that binds covalently to a specific cysteine (Cys 481) in 
the active site of BTK. Ibrutinib  is a potent inhibitor of BTK activity with a median inhibitory 
concentration in a cell -free system of 0.[ADDRESS_783869] intended for oral administration, contains micronized ibrutinib, microcrystalline cellulose 
(National Formulary [NF]), croscarmellose sodium (NF), sodium lauryl sulfate (NF), may contain 
magnesium stearate (NF).  
 
Ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA®) is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the

Version: June 30, 2014  
 treatment of : 1) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in patients who have received at least one prior 
therapy based on overall response rate, 2) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in cluding patients 
with17p deletion or a TP53 mutation, and 3) patients with symptomatic WM  (Treon et al, 2015).  
 
Ibrutinib pharmacokinetics  
 
Following oral administration of ibrutinib at doses of 420, 560, and 840 mg/day, exposure to 
ibrutinib increased as doses increased with substantial intersubject variability.  The mean half life (t
1/2) of ibrutinib across 3 clinical studies ranged from 4 to 9 hours , with a median time to maximum 
plasma concentration (T max) of 2 hours .  Taking into account the approximate doubling in mean 
systemic exposure when dosed with food and the favorable safety profile, ibrutinib can be dosed 
with or without food..  Ibrutinib is extensively metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_9058] 
P450 (CYP) 3A4. The on- target effects of metabolite PCI -[ADDRESS_783870] dose 
exposure. Less than 1% of ibrutinib is excreted renally. Ibrutinib exposure is not altered in patients 
with creatinine clearance (CrCl) >30  mL/min. Patients with severe renal impairment or patients on 
dialysis have not been studied. Following single dose administration, the AUC of ibrutinib increased 2.7 -, 8.2-  and 9.8- fold in subjects with mild (Child -Pugh class A), moderate (Child- Pugh 
class B), and severe (Child -Pugh class C) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal 
liver function.  A higher proportion of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in patients 
with B -cell malignancies (CLL, MCL and WM) with mild hepatic impairment based on NCI organ 
dysfunction working group (NCI -ODWG) criteria for hepatic dysfunction compared to patients 
with normal hepati c function 
Clinical experience with ibrutinib  
 
Ibrutinib  is an orally administered agent. The first human Phase 1 study (PCYC -[ZIP_CODE]) was 
designed to evaluate the initial safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of ibrutinib  in participants with recurrent B cell lymphoma. In this clinical setting a 
useful adverse event profile was obtained, while balancing the risk/benefit considerations .  
 
6 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 Ibrutinib has been under investigation in ongoing or completed clinical studi es in subjects with 
recurrent  B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma 
(SLL),  mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL), pr olymphocytic  
leukemia, and WM.  Responses have been observed in all his tologies treated to date, including 
CLL/SLL, MCL, DLBCL, and WM.  
 
The seven ongoing and completed clinical studies of ibrutinib are summarized in the Investigator 
Brochure. These included two dose -finding Phase 1 studies (PCYC -[ZIP_CODE] and PCYC -1102- CA), 
two Phase 2 studies using a fixed continuous dose of ibrutinib (Studies PCYC -1104- CA and 
PCYC -1106-  CA), two studies combining ibrutinib with chemotherapy (Studies PCYC -1108- CA 
and CYC -1109- CA), and an extended- treatment rollover safety study for subjects who had 
participated in previous studies with ibrutinib (Study PCYC -1103- CA). Across all studies, 
malignancies under investigation include B -cell lymphoma, CLL, SLL, MCL (including both 
bortezomib- pretreated and bortezomib -naive), DLBCL (including activated B cell -like and 
germinal cell B cell -like subtypes), and pro -lymphocytic leukemia. One study is closed to 
enrollment and 6 are currently enrolling subjects. As of the data cutoff for this analysis, safety data 
are available for 392 subjects treated with ibru tinib in a Pharmacyclics -sponsored trial: 312 
subjects receiving ibrutinib monotherapy and 80 subjects receiving ibrutinib in combination with 
1 or more marketed chemotherapeutic agents.  
 In December 2011, Pharmacyclics entered into a development partnership with Janssen Research 
and Development for the continued development and commercialization of ibrutinib. Based on 
results from completed and ongoing clinical trials, future development plans include the initiation 
of additional clinical trials in CLL/SLL , NHL, and multiple myeloma. Phase 3 studies in 
CLL/SLL, MCL and WM are currently in progress.

 characterizing efficacy,  pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. A minimum of 6 subjects per 
cohort received 1 of  5 escalating dose levels of ibrutinib between 1.25 and 12.5 mg/kg for 28 
consecutive days in a  35-day cycle, with the objective of escalating 3 dose levels above that which 
achieved full BTK occupancy based on the fluorescent probe assay. Two additional cohort s 
received a continuous  ibrutinib dose of 8.3 mg/kg without a 7- day rest and a fixed continuous dose 
of 560 mg/day.

Clinical Efficacy  
The outcome of patients  with B -cell malignancies on ibrutinib have been published ( Advani et al, 
2012). Responses have been observed in all histologies dosed to date, including CLL/SLL, MCL, 
DLBCL and WM  who received ibrutinib treatment a t dose up to 560 mg a day. Among 50 
evaluable  subjects across all B -cell histologies, Advani et al (2012) reported an overall response 
rate of  60%, with 7 complete responses (CRs) and 23 partial responses (PRs). A fluorescent probe

Another recent report presented efficacy results from 10 subjects with relapsed/refractory  DLBCL 
receiving a fixed continuous dose of 560 mg/day (Staudt  et al,  2011). All subjects had Stage  IV 
disease and had received a median of 3 previous therapeutic regimens (range: 1, 6). Two subjects 
achieved a CR and [ADDRESS_783874] a PR, for an overall response rate of 30%. An additional  3 subjects 
displayed stable disease with  13, 15, and 21 weeks on treatment. The trial continues to enroll 
subjects with DLBCL into the final cohort using a continuous fixed dose of 560 mg/day.  
A multicentre, prospective study of single agent ibrutinib investigated the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in relapsed or refractory WM patients (Treon et al, 2015). The median number of prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594195] 2 (range 1 -9), and 40% of patients were refractory to their previous 
therapy. Seventy- eight percent of patients had a moderate- high WM IPSS prognostic score. Post 
therapy, the m edian serum IgM levels for all 63 patients  declined from 3,520 to 880 mg/dL at best 
response (p<0.01). Pre -therapy, 46/63 (73.0%) patients had a serum IgM > 3,000 mg/dL; following 
treatment, at best response, 6 /63 (9.5%) patients had a serum IgM > 3,000 mg/dL (p<0.01). Median 
BM involvement decreased from 60% to 25% (p<0.01), while hemoglobin increased from a 
median of 10.5 to 13.8 g/dL at best response (p<0.01). Responses included very good partial 
response (n=1 0); partial response (n=36); and minimal response (n=11)  for overall and major 
responses of 90.5% (95% CI 80.4% -96.4%)  and 73.0% (95% CI 60.3- 83.4%), respectively. The 
median time to at least minor and partial responses were 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Ov erall 
responses were similar regardless of baseline age (<65 vs. > 65 years), ECOG status (0 vs. > 1), 
pre-therapy Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) 
score, serum β 2-microglobulin levels (<3.0 vs. >3.0 mg/L), hemoglobin (<11 vs. >11 g/dL), serum 
IgM (<4,000 vs. > 4,000 mg/dL), BM disease involvement (<50% vs. > 50%), prior relapsed or 
refractory status, and prior lines of therapy (1- 3 vs. >3), as well as for major responses across most 
of the basel ine subgroups (Treon et al, 2015) . Overall and major response rates were highest in 
patients with MYD88L265PCXCR4WT (100% and 91.2%), followed by [CONTACT_403447]88L265PCXCR4WHIM 
(85.7% and 61.9%), and MYD88WTCXCR4WT (71.4% and 28.6%). Overall and major response 
9 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 rates improved with prolonged therapy (>6 cycles) in patients with MYD88L265PCXCR4WT and 
MYD88L265PCXCR4WHIM, with more pronounced improvements occurring for the latter . Best 
serum IgM and hemoglobin responses were also impacted by [CONTACT_594216], with improvements 
most evident in patients with MYD88L265PCXCR4WT, and least in those with 
MYD88WTCXCR4WT. 
 
CT-defined adenopathy ( >1.5 cm) was present in 37 patients at baseline. Serial imaging for 35 
patients showed decreased or resolved (n=25; 67.6%); stable (n=9; 24.3%); or increased (n=1; 
n=2.9%) adenopathy. Two patients came off study before repeat imaging was required. Among [ADDRESS_783875] -defined splenomegaly ( >15 cm), spleen size was decreased (n=4; 57.1%), stable 
(n=2; 28.6%), or not evaluable (n=1; 14.3%) following elective splenectomy. Nine patients (14.3%), 3 with positive anti -MAG antibodies, received ibrutinib for progressive IgM -related 
peripheral sensory neuropathy. All responded, and subjective improvements in peripheral sens ory 
neuropathy occurred in 5, and remained stable in 4 during the treatment course. Symptomatic 
hyperviscosity related to progressive disease that required plasmapheresis prompted start of 
ibrutinib in 4 patients. All responded, and none required additiona l plasmapheresis by [CONTACT_380759] 2. One patient required plasmapheresis for acquired Factor VIII deficiency. He responded, and did not require further plasmapheresis. The spontaneous bleeding events that prompted therapy  
also resolved. 
With a median on  treatment duration of 19.1 (range 0.5- 29.7) months , 43 patients 
(68.3%) remained  on therapy. Reasons for treatment discontinuation included non- response (n=1); 
progressive disease (n=7); treatment -aggravated thrombocytopenia (n=1); hematoma after BM 
biops y (n=1); prolonged drug hold for infection unrelated to ibrutinib (n=1); myelodysplasia/acute 
myeloid leukemia associated with baseline 5q - deletion related to prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (n=1); disease 
transformation possibly related to prior nucleoside analogue ther apy (n=2); antineoplastic therapy 
for rectal carcinoma (n=1); ibrutinib incompatible medication (n=1), patient decision to use commercially sourced ibrutinib (n=2), travel difficulties (n=1), and alternative therapy (n=1). The 
estimated progression- free an d overall survival at 24 months was  69.1% (95% CI 53.2% -80.5%) 
and 95.2% (95% CI 86.0 -98.4%), respectively. For patients with progressive disease, the median 
time to progression was 9.6 (range: 3.5 – 19.4) months if transformation cases were censored, and 
9.5 (range: 3.5 – 19.4) months if transformation events were included. Subset analysis showed that

2.3 Rationale  
 
In WM cells, MYD88L265P triggers NFkB activation via two divergent pathways involving 
Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and IRAK1/IRAK4 (Yang et al, 2013). In vitro , the BTK 
inhibitor ibrutinib has shown selective pro- apoptotic effects on MYD88L265P expressing WM cell 
lines and primary patient cells. (Yang et al, 2013). Activating CXCR4 somatic mutations in WM 
are the first ever reported in cancer, and are similar to germline mutations found in WHIM (Warts, 
Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Mye lokathexis) syndrome patients (Hunter et al, 2014). 
At least 30 different CXCR4WHIM somatic mutations are present in untreated WM patients 
including non- sense and frameshift mutations (Treon et al, 2014). WM cells engineered to express 
CXCR4WHIM mutations show enhanced activation of pro -survival factors AKT and ERK, and 
decreased in vitro  ibrutinib -related apoptosis (Cao et al, 2014a; 2014b). Ibrutinib as a single agent 
has been evaluated in previously treated WM patients. Advani et al (2012) obs erved responses in 
3 of 4 WM patients in a Phase I study. In a prospective multicenter study, 63 patients with relapsed 
or refractory disease received single agent ibrutinib. Overall and major response rates were 90.5% and 73.0%, and were highest in patients with MYD88
L265PCXCR4Wild -Type (WT) (100% and 91.2%), 
followed by [CONTACT_403447]88L265PCXCR4WHIM (85.7% and 61.9%), and MYD88WTCXCR4WT (71.4% and 
28.6%). The median time to response was 4 weeks, and the 2- year progression- free and overall 
survival rates for all pat ients were 69.1% and 95.2%, respectively. Treatment was well tolerated, 
with manageable adverse events. Heavily pre -treated patients were more at risk for significant 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. No significant declines in uninvolved immunoglobulins (serum IgA, IgG) were observed over the course of therapy. Taken together, the above findings 
suggest that: i) treatment with ibrutinib is likely to produce high overall (85- 90%) and major (70%) 
response rates that are at least as comparable to best current  frontline WM therapy regimens; ii) 
treatment with ibrutinib is likely to produce more rapid responses (4 weeks) versus current WM frontline therapy (>8 weeks to 24 weeks); and iii) treatment with ibrutinib is likely to be as well 
tolerated, and with less adverse impact on blood counts and uninvolved immunoglobulin levels 
compared to many current frontline treatment options for WM.

35% of patients (Treon et al, 2012; Hunter et al, 2014; Treon et al, 2014). MYD88 L265P triggers 
activation of BTK, the target of ibrutinib (Yang et al, 2013). CXCR4 is a receptor that responds to 
SDF-1a ligand stimulation, and mediates trafficking of WM cells to the BM microenvironment. 
Both nonsense (leading to protein truncation) and frameshift CXCR4 WHIM -like somatic 
mutations have been described in WM patients which impact the regulatory C -regulatory domain 
of CXCR4, and lead to hyper -activation of AKT and ERK in response to SDF -1a activation (Cao 
et al, 2014a; 2014b). WM cells engineered to express nonsense and frameshift CXCR4 mutant 
receptors show resistance to ibrutinib, w hich is in part mediated by [CONTACT_594217] (Cao et al, 
2014a). Use of plerixafor, an FDA approved antagonist of CXCR4, sensitized CXCR4 WHIM mutated cells to the effects of ibrutinib. CXCR4 WHIM mutations are typi[INVESTIGATOR_594196], and the 
clonal distribution varies considerably among WM patients (Treon et al, 2014; Xu et al, submitted). 
 
The genomic events associated with ibrutinib response and acquired resistance requires further 
clarification in WM patients. Several somatic mutations in patients with CLL with  acquired 
resistance to ibrutinib have been reported (Woyach et al, NEJM 2014). Their studies identified a 
cysteine- to-serine mutation in BTK at the binding site of ibrutinib in five patients (BTK
C481S) as 
well as three distinct mutations in PLCγ2 in two p atients. Functional analysis showed that the 
C481S mutation of BTK results in a protein that is only reversibly inhibited by [CONTACT_9059]. The 
R665W and L845F mutations in PLCγ2 were postulated to be gain- of-function mutations that lead 
to autonomous B -cell-receptor activity. These mutations were not found in any of the patients with 
prolonged lymphocytosis who were taking ibrutinib. 
 
Importantly, their presence (at a subclonal level) at baseline was demonstrated in these studies. Knowledge of somatic variants  associated with ibrutinib response and acquired resistance may 
provide both predictive markers, and lead to treatment advances. The use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) with deep map read coverage ( >120 X) provides the opportunity to interrogate

 Drug accountability will be done at each study visit; unused drug and diaries will be collected from 
the participant, unused drug will be counted and returned to the pharmacy to be destroyed. A new 
prescription for either one cycle or three cycles , as detailed above,  will be filled by [CONTACT_2299], 
and they will be given a new diary at each visit. In some circumstances, when it is unclear at a visit 
if a patient is to continue on to the next cycle (i.e. in the event of suspected but not confirmed 
progression), then the part icipant will be allowed to continue on their current supply of drug and 
diary use. Drug and diary may then be sent to the patient by a trackable delivery service, with receipt confirmed, if it is later determined that the participant is eligible to continu e with study 
drug. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to provide a participant an interim supply of drug and diary. In such circumstances, interim drug supply may be provided or sent to the patient,

 5.4 General Concomi tant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Participants will be instructed not to take any additional medications (including over -the-counter 
products) during the course of the study without prior consultation with the investigator. At each 
visit, the  investigator will ask the participant about any new medications he/she is or has taken 
after the start of the study drug.  
Anti-emetics are permitted if clinically indicated. Standard supportive care medications are 
permitted. All c oncomitant medications/Significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_32546] ≤ 30 days prior to 
study drug start and for the duration of study treatment, including physical therapy and blood 
transfusions, should be recorded. The following restrictions apply during the entire duration of the 
study:  
• No other investigational therapy should be given to participants.  
• No other anti -cancer therapy including radiation therapy should be given to participants. If 
such agents are required for a patient then the patient must first be withdrawn from the 
study. 
• Growth factors (i.e. G -CSF, GM -CSF, erythropoietin, platelets growt h factors etc.) are not 
to be administered prophylactically, including to establish eligibility, but may be prescribed at the discretion of the treating physician for treatment -related hematologic events in 
accordance with ASCO guidelines, and to meet re -treatment criteria .  They may be given 
on the same day to establish re -treatment criteria  
• Concomitant use of anti -platelet agents and anticoagulants:  
o Laboratory studies have shown that, in vitro, ibrutinib can prevent platelets from 
aggregating normally; the clinical significance of this finding is unknown at this 
time. While serious bleeding has been uncommon in participants treated to date, it 
is possible that treatment with the study drug could increase the risk of bruising or 
bleeding, particularly in pa rticipants receiving other anti- platelet agents or 
anticoagulants. Participants receiving anti- platelet agents in conjunction with 
ibrutinib should be observed closely for any signs of bleeding or bruising, and 
ibrutinib should be withheld in the event of any grade 2 or higher bleeding events  
20 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 until complete resolution to < grade 1.  Participants with any grade CNS bleeding 
will have treatment held.  If the CNS bleeding event is attributed to ibrutinib 
therapy, then treatment will be discontinued.  If the CN S bleeding is attributed to 
other causes (i.e. trauma), then treatment will be held until resolution, at which time ibrutinib can be re -started.  Participants on anticoagulants with CNS bleeding 
events must discontinue anticoagulation prior to re -starting ibrutinib.  Participants 
may resume at previous dose level.  
o Warfarin or vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib.  
o Subjects requiring the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (eg, atrial fibrillation), cons ider the risks and benefits of continuing ibrutinib treatment. If 
therapeutic anticoagulation is clinically indicated, treatment with ibrutinib should be held and not be restarted until the subject is clinically stable and has no signs of 
bleeding. Subject s should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of bleeding. 
No dose reduction is required when study drug is restarted.  
o Supplements such as fish oils and vitamin E preparations should be avoided. 
o Use ibrutinib with caution in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or medications 
that inhibit platelet function.  
• Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied.  
CYP3A-  Inhibitors/Inducers  
Ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A. Avoid co- administration with strong CYP3A4 or 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors and consider alternative agents with less CYP3A inhibition.  
• If a strong CYP3A inhibitor (eg , ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, nefazadone, or c obicistat) must be used, reduce 
ibrutinib dose to 140 mg or withhold treatment for the duration of inhibitor use. Subjects 
should be monitored for signs of ibrutinib toxicity.  
• If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor (eg, voriconazole, erythromycin, amprenavir, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 
atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, fluconazole, 
fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil, amiodarone, or dronedarone) must be used, reduce 
ibrutinib to 140 mg (for 840 mg/day dose, reduce to 280 mg) for the duration of the 
21 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 inhibitor use. Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during ibrutinib/placebo treatment, as 
these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (see Section  5.4).  
• No dose adjustment is required in combination with mild inhibitors.  
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (eg, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort). Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction. 
A list of common CYP3A inhibitors and inducers is provided in Appendix X .  A comprehensive

inhibitor (with an IC 50 of 2.15 μg/mL).  Ibrutinib is not expected to have systemic drug- drug 
interactions with P -gp substrates. However, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit 
intestinal P -gp after a therapeutic dose. There is no clinical data available; therefore, to avoid a 
potential interaction in the GI tract, narrow therapeutic range P-gp substrates such as digoxin, 
should be taken at least 6 hours before or after ibrutinib.  
Any medications known to cause QT prolongation should be used with caution; periodic 
monitoring with electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be considered.  
 No chronic treatment with systemic steroids (at dosages equivalent to prednisone > 20 mg/day for 
more than 14 days) or other immunosuppressive agents should be used. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_129534].

5.8 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study  
 Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria apply:  
• 2 years of follow -up is completed 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal of consent for data submission 
• Death  
 The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was rem oved, must be 
documented in the case report f orm (CRF) . 
 
A QACT Treatment Ended/Off Study Form will be filled out when a participant comes off study. 
This form can be found on the QACT website or obtained from the QACT registration staff.  
 6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Dose delays and modifications will be made as indicated in the following table(s). The descriptions 
and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for dose delays and dose modifications. A copy of the 
CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website  
 http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.  
 
In the case of tox icity, appropriate medical treatment should be used (including anti -emetics, anti -
diarrheals, etc.). All adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_594221], through the study and until the final study visit. Participants 
continuing to experience toxicity at the off study visit may be contact[CONTACT_542288]. 
 
For patients who are unable to tolerate the protocol -specified dosing schedule, dose adjustments 
are permitted. If administration of ibrutinib  must be interrupted because of unacceptable toxicity, 
26 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 drug dosing will be interrupted or modified according to rules described in Table 6- 1.  
 
Dose re- escalations will not be permitted once dose reduced to next lower dose level. Dose 
reductions are permitted down to dose level - 2 in Table 6- 1 before a patient is taken off study. If a 
participant  requires a dose delay for  > 28 days, then the participant will be permitted to resume 
study treatment at the discretion of the treating investigator  IF toxicity does not recur and is fully 
resolved .  The participant will be allowed to resume study drug at the previous dose level.  If the 
toxicity recurs the Drug Modification/Discontinuation Act ions listed below should be followed.  
All interruptions or chan ges to study drug administration must be recorded.

(1 x 140 mg capsule)  
 
 Dosing will be held for any of the following conditions:  
 
• Grade 4 ANC (< 500/μL) for > 7 days . Neutrophil growth factors may be used as  per 
ASCO guidelines (see section 5.4). 
• Grade 3 Platelets (< 50,000/μL) in the presence of clinically significant bleeding events; 
or, in subjects with baseline thrombocytopenia, a platelet decrease of 50- 74% from bas eline 
in presence of bleeding;  
• Grade 4 Platelets (< 25,000/μL) or in subjects with baseline thrombocytopenia, decrease  
of  > 75% from baseline or < 20,000/ μL, whichever is higher;  
• Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (if persistent despi[INVESTIGATOR_36067]/or  
antidiarrheal therapy);  
• Any other related grade 4 toxicities and any unmanageable non- hematologic Grade 3  
toxicities.  
• For Grade 3 or 4 atrial fibrillation or persistent atrial fibrillation of any grade, consider the 
27 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, [ADDRESS_783893] anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents may 
be considered for the thromboprophyla xis of atrial fibrillation  (see section 5.4 for more 
information) .  
 
Drug Modification/Discontinuation Actions for Ibrutinib- related events  
 
• 1st Hold. Ibrutinib will be held until recovery to baseline or grade 1 from criteria to hold, then restarted at the original dose level (420 mg daily);  
 
• 2nd Hold. Ibrutinib will be held until recovery to baseline or grade 1  from criteria to hold, 
then restarted at dose level - 1, i.e. 280 mg daily;  
 
• 3rd Hold. Ibrutinib will be held until recovery to baseline or grade 1 from criteria to hold, 
then restarted  at dose level - 2, i.e. 140 mg daily;  
 
• 4th Hold. Ibrutinib should be  discontinued. 
 
Dose Modification for Hepatic Impaired Subjects  
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver and therefore subjects with clinically significant 
hepatic impairment at the time of s creening (Child-  Pugh class B or C)  are excluded from 
study participation. For subjects who develop mild liver impairment while on study (Child-Pugh class A), the recommended dose reduction for ibrutinib is to a level of 280 mg daily 
(two capsules). For subjects who develop moderate liver impairment while on study (Child-
Pugh class B), the recommended dose reduction is to a level of 140 mg daily (one capsule). 
Subjects who develop severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh class C) must hold study 
drug until res olved to moderate impairment (Child -Pugh class B) or better. Monitor 
subjects for signs of toxicity and follow dose modification guidanc e as needed (Refer  to 
Appendix B ). 
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following 
list of reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE 
(Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expe dited  reporting  in addition  to routine  
28 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 reporting.  
 
7.1 Expected Toxicities  
 An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure 
specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. Abnormal 
laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_783894]  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event List (s) for Ibrutinib  
 
Risks  
Bleeding -related events  
There have been reports of hemorrhagic events in subjects treated with ibrutinib both with and 
without thrombocytopenia. These include primarily minor hemorrhagic events such as contusion, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and petechiae; and major hemorrhagic events , some fatal,  including gastrointestinal 
bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage and hematuria. Use of ibrutinib in subjects requiring other anticoagulant s or medications that inhibit platelet function may increase the risk of bleeding. 
Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied. See Section 5.4 for guidance on 
concomitant use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet therapy and/or supplements . See Section  5.[ADDRESS_783895] been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib, particularly in subjects with cardiac risk factors,  hypertension, acute infections, and a previous history of atrial 
fibrillation. For atrial fibrillation which persists, consider the risks and benefits of ibrutinib 
treatment and follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section 6..  
Cytopenias  
29 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 Treatment -emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) were 
reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  
Diarrhea  
Diarrhea is the most frequently reported non- hematologic AE with ibrutinib monotherapy and 
combination therapy.. Other fr equently reported gastrointestinal events include nausea, vomiting, 
and constipation. These events are rarely severe. Should symptoms be severe or prolonged, follow 
the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section 6).  
Infections  
Fatal and non -fatal infections have occurred with ibrutinib therapy. At least 25% of subjects with 
MCL and 35% of subjects with CLL had Grade 3 or greater infections per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The most commonly reported infections 
include  pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infection and sepsis. Although causality has not been 
established, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib.  
Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer   
Non-melanoma skin cancers have occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib.  Monitor patients 
for the appearance of non -melanoma skin cancer.  
Rash  
Rash has been commonly reported in subjects treated with either single agent ibrutinib or in combination with chemotherapy. In a randomized Phase 3 study (PCYC -1112- CA), rash occurred 
at a higher rate in the ibrutinib arm than in the control arm. Most rashes were mild to moderate in severity..  
Lymphocytosis and Leukostasis  
Leukostasis  
There were isolated cases of leukostasis reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib. A high 
number of circulating lymphocytes (>400,000/µL) may confer increased risk. For subject and 
ibrutinib management guidance, refer to Section 5. 
30 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 Lymphocytosis  
Upon initiation of treatment, a reversible increase in lymphocyte counts (ie, ≥50% increase from 
baseline and an absolute count >5000/µL), often associated with reduction of lymphadenopathy, 
has been observed in most subjects with CLL/ small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) treated with 
ibrutinib. This effect has also been observed in some subjects with MCL treated with ibrutinib. 
This observed lymphocytosis is a pharmacodynamic effect and should not be considered 
progressive disease in the absence of other clinical findings. In both disease types, lymphocytosis 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_594203] (median time 1.1 weeks) and 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_36065] a median of 8.0 weeks in subjects with MCL and 18.7 weeks in subjects 
with CLL/SLL.  
A large increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes (eg, >400,000/µL) has been observed in some subjects. Lymphocytosis was not commonly observed in subjects with Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinemia treated with ibrutinib. Lymphocytosis appeared to occur in lowe r incidence 
and at lesser magnitude in subjects with CLL/SLL receiving ibrutinib in combination with chemoimmunotherapy.  
Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
There have been reports of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) events in subjects treated with single -
agent ibrutinib or in combination with chemotherapy. Subjects at risk of tumor lysis syndrome 
are those with comorbidities and/or risk factors such as high tumor burden prior to treatment, increased uric acid (hyperuricemia), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bulky disease at 
baseline, and pre ‐existing kidney abnormalities  
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)  
Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been reported in patients treated with ibrutinib. 
Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD. Should symptoms develop follow 
the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section 6).

Version: June 30, [ADDRESS_783896] 
dose of study drug. Any female subjects receiving study drug(s) who become pregnant m ust 
immediately discontinue study drug. The Investigator should counsel the subject, discussing any 
risks of continuing the pregnancy and any possible effects on the fetus.   
Although pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event, the outcome will need to be 
documented. Any pregnancy occurring in a subject or subject’s partner from the time of consent 
to 30 days  (or 90 days for male partners)  after the last dose of study drug must be reported. Any 
occurrence of pregnancy must be reported to Pharmacyc lics Drug Safety, or designee, per SAE 
reporting timelines. All pregnancies will be followed for outcome, which is defined as elective 
termination of the pregnancy, miscarriage, or delivery of the fetus. Pregnancies with an outcome 
of live birth, the newborn infant will be followed until 30 days old by [CONTACT_594222]. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect noted 
in the infant must be reported as a serious adverse event.  
Other Malignancies  
All new malignant tumors including solid tumors, skin malignancies and hematologic 
malignancies will be reported for the duration of study treatment and during any protocol -
specified follow -up periods including post -progression follow -up for overall survival. If 
observed, enter data in the corresponding eCRF.

 8.1 Ibrutinib  
 
8.1.1 Description  
 Ibrutinib  is 1 -[(3R)-3-[4-amino -3-(4-phenoxyphenyl) -1H-pyrazolo[3,4- d]pyrimidin- 1-yl]-1-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_33214]] -2-propen -1-one and has a molecular weight of 440.50 g/mole (anhydrous basis). 
Ibrutinib  exhibited 18% to 23% oral bioavailability in rats and 7% to 11% oral bioavailability in 
dogs. The mean terminal half -life of ibrutinib after oral administration ranged from 1.[ADDRESS_783902] a  1.5- to 
2.5-hour half -life of ibrutinib in humans. The effects of renal and/or hepatic impairment on drug 
clearance are not known at this time. In vitro studies have indicated that ibrutinib is metabolized 
extensively by [CONTACT_9058] P450 (CYP) 3A4. 
. 
8.1.2 Form  
 
The structure of ibrutinib is:  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Ibrutinib is a white to off -white crystalline solid. Ibrutinib has a single chiral center and is the R -

9.1 Laboratory Correlative Studies  
 
Genomic and transcriptional studies  
Whole genome and transcriptome studies will be performed using bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] (40 ml) 
and peripheral blood (PB) samples (4 lavender tops) that will be collected in hepar inized syringes 
from all study participants at baseline, cycles 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48. Bone marrow (BM) and 
peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells will be isolated by [CONTACT_309459], and 
WM lymphoplasmacytic cells isolated from BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] s by [CONTACT_398]19+ selection using 
immunomagnetic MACS micro -beads (Miltenyi -Biotech, Auburn, CA). By [CONTACT_49808], the 
purity of isolated B -cells (CD19+) was over 90%, and median clonal B -cell population by [CONTACT_594225] >95% by [CONTACT_115564]. CD19 -depleted PBMC will be used as normal paired 
tissue. High molecular weight DNA will be isolated using Allprep DNA/RNA mini kit (Qiagen, 
Valencia, CA). Library construction and WGS of paired- end clones will be performed by 
[CONTACT_594226]. (CGI; Mountain View CA) as previously described. Read sequences will 
be aligned to reference genome NCBI Build 37. High confidence somatic variants will be 
identified using CGAT version 1.3 with a somatic score of 0.1, giving an estimated one false 
somatic single nu cleotide variant per 17.7 Mb of DNA. Copy number will be estimated by %GC 
normalized read depth, and acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) identified as copy- neutral loss of 
heterozygosity. Allele imbalance will be determined by [CONTACT_594227][INVESTIGATOR_594204] 100 Kb. Transcriptome studies will be performed using 
Illumina HiSeq platform. Gene expression will be inferred from read counts, and correlated to 
genomic findings and response to therapy. Categorical c omparisons will be analyzed using the 
Fisher’s exact probability test, and the Mann- Whitney U -test to evaluate ordinal comparisons. 
Benjamini Hochberg correction will be used for multiple comparison testing with a p -value < 0.05 
deemed to be significant. C alculations will be performed with R (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria). Confirmatory and additional exploratory studies may also be 
performed on collected DNA and RNA that are relevant to WM pathobiology and treatment outcome.

For the purposes of this study, participants should be re -evaluated every 4  weeks ± 5 days for 
cycles 1, 2, and 3 and thereafter every 12 weeks ± 2 week s for the remaining cycles for a total of  
48 cycles,  and within 4 weeks ± [ADDRESS_783913] -treatment , patients  will continue to be followed -up every 24 weeks ± 
[ADDRESS_783914] International Workshop on WM ( Anderson et al, 
2012).  
 
11.1 Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity:  All participants who have received at least one dose of study drug will 
be evaluable for toxicity . 
Evaluable for objective response:  Applicable to those participants  who have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated. These participants  will 
have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
 
11.1.1 Response Criteria  
 Complete Response (CR): A complete response (CR) is defined as having resolution of WM 
related symptoms, normalization of serum IgM levels with complete disappearance of IgM 
paraprotein by [CONTACT_5294], and resolution of any adenopathy or splenomegaly. A complete 
response requires reconfi rmation demonstrating normal serum IgM levels, and absence of IgM 
paraprotein by [CONTACT_403471] a measurement repeated at least 2 weeks later.  
 
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR): is defined as >  90% reduction in serum IgM levels, or 
normalization of ser um IgM levels. 
 
Partial Response (PR): Partial response (PR) is defined as achieving a >  50% reduction in serum 
IgM levels.  
 
44 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 Minor Response (MR): A minor response (MR) is defined 25- 49% reduction in serum IgM levels.  
 
Stable Disease (SD): Stable disease is  defined as having < 25% change in serum IgM levels, in 
the absence of new or increasing adenopathy or splenomegaly and/or other progressive signs or 
symptoms of WM. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): Progressive disease (PD) is defined as occurring when a greater than 
25% increase in serum IgM level occurs (with an absolute increase of at least 500 mg/dL) from 
the lowest attained response value, or progression of clinically significant disease related 
symptom(s). Reconfirmation of the initial IgM increase is required when IgM is the sole criterion 
for progressive disease confirmation.  Death from any cause for WM will also be considered a 
progression event. For participants on active therapy who are on a drug hold for > [ADDRESS_783915] be on study drug 
for >2 consecutive weeks to be considered eligible for serum IgM response assessment. An increase of 1 cm in any axis for adenopathy, or 2 cm in the craniocaudal axis of the spleen wi ll be 
considered evidence of progression of extramedullary disease. Development of Bing Neel syndrome, or other extramedullary disease manifestations, as well as disease transformation will 
be considered as progressive events.  
Non-response (NR): Persistant  signs or symptoms of WM disease that prompted therapy despi[INVESTIGATOR_594210].

36, and 48  . 
 
11.1.3 Progression -Free Survival  
 
Progression- Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time 
of objective disease progression or death. Median PFS, as well as 2- year and 4 -year landmark 
PFS analyses will be performed.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This is single arm, open label, Phase II, single cente r study designed to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of ibrutinib in previously untreated WM patients. Treatment will be administered 
in 4- week cycles, and participants will re ceive treatment for up to 48 cycles. Treatment will be 
comprised of ibrutinib at 4 20 mg per day by [CONTACT_594228].  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
The primary endpoint of this study is to assess the Major Response Rate (PR or better).  Overall  
response rates ( MR or better ), and Very Good Partial Response/Complete Response (VGPR/CR) of 
ibrutinib  in previously untreated, symptomatic WM pa tients  will also be evaluated.  The analysis 
for the primary endpoint, Major response rate ( PR or better), will be based on the evaluable 
populat ion. The evaluable population will be  defined as all enrolled subjects who have received at 
least [ADDRESS_783920] -baseline disease assessment. The null 
hypothesis is that the major response rate (PR or better) will be 40% or lower.  The major  response 
rate and its exact 95% confidence intervals ( CI) will be calculated  and the null hypothesis will be 
rejected if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval exceeds 40% . The analysis for overall  
response ( MR or b etter) will be similarly evaluated. In addition, the number and percent of subjects 
by [CONTACT_594229] (CR, VGPR, PR, MR, SD, or PD) will be summarized.    
 
13.2 Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration  
 
A total of up to 33 participants will be enrolled .  With the en rollment of 30 evaluable participants , 
based on the assumption that the Major Response Rate for ibrutinib  is 70%, the study will  have 
slightly greater than  90% power to declare that the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI  for Major 
Response Rate  will exceed 40%.  A Major Response Rate of 18/30 or higher will be required to 
declare the trial as having met its primary endpoint. In the study of previously treated, 
relapsed/refractory WM patients (n=63), the observed Major Response Rate wa s 73.0% (95% CI, 
47 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 62.04 to 83.96). It is expected that the Major Response Rate in untreated WM would be similar or 
better than the Major Response Rate in previously treated patients.    
 13.3 Stratification Factors  
 
No stratification factors will be applied to any analysis. 
 
13.4 Interim Monitoring Plan  
 
See section 13.2.  
 13.5 Analysis of Primary Endpoints  
 
See section 13.1  
 13.6 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
The secondary endpoints include:  
 
• The safety and tolerability of ibrutinib in previously untreated, symptomatic WM pa tients . 
 
• Duration of response (DOR), time to response (TTR),  progression- free s urvival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS)  
 
• To identify genomic variants associated with ibrutinib response, response duration and 
acquired resistance, including evolution of subclonal variants present at baseline. 
  Adverse events for events deemed grade [ADDRESS_783921] by [CONTACT_2054]. A 2-year and 4 -year landmark analysis will be also performed for PFS and OS. Duration of 
response will be similarly evaluated using the Kaplan- Meier methodology. Time to response will 
48 
 
DF/HCC Biomedical Protocol Templat e 
Version: June 30, 2014  
 be evaluated as continues variable and summarized (median, range)  for participants  who achieved 
response .  An update of these endpoints will also be provided at the end of the study, which is 
defined as [ADDRESS_783922]

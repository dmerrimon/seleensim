Hifko,  MD, and Shahroz  Fatima,  BS. Acceptance  of this document  constitutes  the agreement  by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_2338].   1. Background  and Rationale:   
Tons illectomy  is the 2nd most  common  outpatient  pediatric  surgical  procedure  performed  
in the U.S. with over half a million  surgeries  annually.  The two main  primary  indications  for 
pedia tric tonsillectomy  are recurrent  infection s and sleep  disordered  breathing  (SDB)1. 
Tonsillectomy  is define d as a surgical  procedure  performed  with or without  adenoidectomy  that 
completely  removes  the tonsil,  including  its capsule,  by [CONTACT_2357]1. They  are relatively  low risk surgical  procedures  usually  
done as a same-day surgery2. The Royal  College  of Surgeons  of England  found  that 
tonsillectomies  had a delayed  discharge  rate of 1.9 % due to various  reasons,  including  post-op 
pain,  hemorrhage,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_2340],  and vomiting.  The top reason  for these  delays  was 
inadequate  pain control  accounting  for 36% of delayed  discharges  3. Acute  pain can cause  stress,  
fear, and anxiety  for both the patient  and the caregiver  4. Furthermore,  it is also associated  with 
poor oral intake,  vomiting,  and sleep  disturbances  for the patient  5.  Thus , adequate  post-op pain 
control  is an essential  component  to ensuring  timely  healing  and patient  well-being  following  
surgery.  Additionally,  according  to prior research  done  on adult  tonsillectomy  patients , the 
incidence  of severe  pain, defined  as pain ≥7 on a 10-point  scale,  is 14.5%  on post-op Day 1, 
39.9%  on Day 3, 28.4%  on Day [ADDRESS_2173] a good safety profile  7. 
However , recent research has found significant genetic variability in this enzyme, where poor 
metabolizers get  little or  no pain r elief while  ultra-rapid metabolizers are at high risk for 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]  8. Although genetic testing f or CYP2D6  exists, it is expensive , and 
normal metabolizers may still  experience adverse effects. In  2013 , the FDA issued a “black box 
warning” for codeine , advising  health care professionals “to prescribe an alternative analgesic 
for postoperative pain control in children ” 8. Furthermore, a randomized trial in S DB patients 
undergoing tonsillectomy found that t he number of desaturation events per hour (preoperative to 
postoperative) was reduced by a mean of 1.79 ± 7.57 in the group given ibuprofen compared 
with an average increase of 11.17 ± 15.[ADDRESS_2174] -tonsillectomy pain relief1. A recent  trial in 
adults  compared a combined acet aminophen+ ibuprofen regimen against only acetaminophen 
or only ibuprofen and found that the combined regimen had improved pain control  13. This 
suggest s that a combined regimen  may be superior to a single non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2342] . 
Furthermore, there is also evidence of potential synergistic effects when the 2 drugs are given 
at the same time 14. Some otolaryngologists  at SLCH currently advise their patients to take 
acetaminophen and ibuprofen on an alternating basis, with one drug administered every 3 
hours, but each drug only given every 6 hours. This is done on the belief that more frequent 
analgesic dosing will provide  superior pain control. However, this practice has never been 
compared directly to giving both drugs simultaneous every 6 hours.  
Necessary caretaker  involvement  in the pediatric population  adds a new layer of 
complexity  to medication dosing . Adhering to v arious, often confusing or tedious, pain control 
CONFIDENTIAL:  This document  is the intellect ual property  of Michael  Montana,  MD, PhD,  David  S. Leonard,  MD, Alan  
Hifko,  MD, and Shahroz  Fatima,  BS. Acceptance  of this document  constitutes  the agreement  by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_2338].   regimens post -operatively can be a challenge for caregivers  who are balancing many other 
aspects of life while caring for the child. This is especially true for families with caregivers who 
are working and cannot always be available around the clock to give frequent scheduled pain 
medication. Furthermore, despi[INVESTIGATOR_2343], children do not enjoy taking 
medications, which can further frustrate caretakers. The American Academy of Family 
Physicians notes these limitations and suggests h aving a simplified regimen  to assist patients 
and families in adhering to the medication regiment  15. Thus , we aim to assess a means to limit 
this confusion while also assessing pain control and patient satisfaction . We will compare a 
combined regimen where both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are administered together every [ADDRESS_2175]. Louis Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2344], one medication given every three hours . There is 
currently a dearth of information regarding adherence to medication regimens and we hope our 
study will help elucidate a more convenient regimen with equal or improved pain control to a 
more tedious current standard pain control regimen 16.  
In this study , we will compare the common post-tonsill ectomy pediatric pain regimen of 
alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen every three hours with a  regimen in which a patient is 
given both medications every  [ADDRESS_2176] -tonsillectomy pain in pediatric populations . We aim to assess  how a combined 
scheduled dosing regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen every 6 hours compares with the 
dosing regimen currently used at SLCH of alternating acetaminophen and ibu profen every 3  
hours. We hope to show that  a combined regimen is non-inferior  in terms of instances of severe 
pain experienced by [CONTACT_2358][INVESTIGATOR_2345], and/or in need for  rescue pain 
medication to the alternating regimen.  
In addition, w e believe th at based on the current guidelines for  pediatric post -tonsillectomy 
pain control, the simultaneous administration of acetaminophen  and ibuprofen may play a 
significant role in improving patient satisfaction and compliance. This regimen was relatively well 
tolerated with minimal adverse events reported in adults undergoing dental surgery  13. A recent 
double -blind study  performed in adults following wisdom teeth removal show ed improved pain 
control with a combined regimen whe n compared to either acetaminophen or ibuprofen alone13. 
However, there is a dearth of studies to guide therapy in the pediatric  population.  We hope to 
expand on this by [CONTACT_2359] a new regimen that may be easier to follow , and will likely improve 
compliance and satisfaction amongst patients and caregivers. Furthermore, there are no studies 
comparing a combined dose of acetaminophen and ibuprofen administered at the same time 
versus an alternating dosing strategy. As the com bined dosing strategy is markedly easier for 
families to comply with , if it is non -inferior to the alternating dosing strategy , it would likely be 
preferred.  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_2346]. the current practice of alternating each medication regimen following 
tonsillectomy in pediatric populations. It will allow us to assess the degree of difference in both 
pain relief and patient satisfaction while also assessing for any u nforeseen adverse outcomes. 
We will use information gleaned here to power and design a larger scale study.

Post operatively  pain scores  will be measured  in the PACU  when  first awakening,  at [ADDRESS_2181]  of care 
in the PACU. Follow  up surveys  to assess  pain scores  will be sent to participants  twice  a day on 
POD  1, 3, and 7. In the event  a participant  doesn’t  have  an email  address  or access  to a 
smartphone  or computer,  they will be sent home  with a copy  of the surveys  and the study  team  
will call them  to obtain  the responses.   Pain will be assessed  using  the standardized  FLACC  scale  
for all subjects,  as well as an additional  assessment  using  the standardized  Wong -Baker  Faces  
scale  for subjects  ages  [ADDRESS_2182]  their medication  regimen  administered  by

The study  period for each  subject  ends  once  all surveys  are submitted . The total time 
spent  per subject  for this study  will be approximately  [ADDRESS_2184]  basic  demographic  information  (age,  race,  
gender),  indication  for tonsillectomy,  surgical technique,  and pertinent  medical  history.   
 
6.2. Clinical  Assessments  
Prior  to pain medication  administration  the patient  will undergo  a focused  history  and 
physical  exam performed  by a member  of the research  team  to check  contraindications  to the 
proposed  medications .  
 
6.[ADDRESS_2185] operatively  pain scores  and safety  assessments  will be measured  in the PACU  upon  
awakening,  prior to administration  of any rescue  medications,  and prior to discharge . Following  
discharge  from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  each study  participant ’s caregiver  will receive  online  survey s to 
complete  twice  a day (12 hours  apart)  on POD  1, 3, and 7. Caregivers  will be requested  to 
complete  one survey  between  6am and 9am and another  survey  between  6pm and 9pm.  Surveys  
will be distributed  via Redcap.  They  will evaluate  and record  the following  information  prior to the 
administration  of the morning  and evening  medication s that day:  
 
1) Patient’s  Faces,  Legs,  Arms,  Cry, Consolability  (FLACC)  score  for all children  (Fig. 3) 
2) Patient’s  Wong -Baker  Faces  Pain Scale  score  for children  ages 7 and older  (Fig. 4)  
3) Dose  in milligrams  of rescue  pain medication  (oxycodone)  used  in the past 12 hours  
4) Has the patient  experienced  severe  pain >= 7/10 on either  scale.  (yes or no)  
5) Any adverse  events  since  the surgery  or submission  of the previous  survey 
6) Ease  of use of the assigned  regimen  on the Likert  scale  rated  from very easy  to very difficult   
 
6.4 Medication  Log 
 Time  and date of medication  administration  will be obtained  from the subjects’  electronic  
medical  record  during  their time in the PACU  and for those  admitted  post operatively.  Upon  
discharge  a paper  medication  log will be given  to subjects  to record  the time and date medication  
is administered . This log will be used  to assess  adherence  to the study  regimen,  duration  of 
medication  usage,  and use of break  through  medication.    
 
7. Outcome  Measures

severe  bleeding,  anorexia,  or intractable  nausea  or vomiting . 
 
7.[ADDRESS_2186]  a separate  analysis  for children  
above  and below  the age of 12 to ensure  there  are no significant  differences  between  the groups,  
If there  are significant  differences,  we will report  those  in a stratified  analysis.  
7.3.2.  Comparison  of pain scores  based  on surgical  technique  
Surgical  technique  for tonsillectomy  can be divided  into 3 major  categories:  cold 
dissection,  electrocautery,  and harmonic  scalpel  tonsillectomy.  The cold knife  method  removes  
the tonsils  by [CONTACT_2363] a standard  scalpel  and is the most  common  procedure.  The electrocautery  
meth od burns  tonsillar  tissue  and assists  with bleeding,  but causes  thermal  injury  to surrounding  
tissue.  Studies  show  that although  bleeding  was significantly  lower,  pain intensity  at [ADDRESS_2187]  any strata  specific  differences.  
 
7.4. Analysis  
This is a non-inferiority  pi[INVESTIGATOR_2348] 
(FLACC  score≥7)  in the combined  regimen  vs. the alternating  regimen.  Our null hypothesis  is that 
the combined  regimen  is inferior  to the currently  used  alternating  regimen  and our alternative  
hypothesis  is that it is non-inferior.  Based  on clinical  judgment,  the margin  within  which  we will 
consider  the proposed  combined  dosing  regimen  to be similar  in effectiveness  to the current  
clinical  practice  of an alternating  regimen  is 0.15.  Based  on prior studies  in adult  tonsillectomy  
patients  using  a 10-point  scale,  the incidence  of severe  pain (≥7) on  post-op Day 1 is 0.145,  Day 
3 is 0.399,  and Day 7 is 0.284,  with a final total proportion  of pain ≥[ADDRESS_2188] convert  FLACC  pain scores  (graded  on a 10 point  scale)  into a binary  
outcome:  those  with severe  pain (scores  ≥7) and those  without  severe  pain (scores  ≤ 7). We 
chose  7 as pain scores  ≥7 are considered  to be “severe ” based  on prior studies6,17. In addition  to 
providing  current  pain assessments,  caregivers  will also be asked  whether  or not their child had 
severe  pain since  they left the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (first survey)  or since  they last filled out a previous  survey  
(all other  surveys).   
 As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  we based  our sample  size on 2018 -2019  hospit al data which  
revealed  that over 700 pediatric  tonsillectomies  +/- adenoidectomies  were  conducted  at the St. 
Louis  Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2349]’s  Specialty  Care  Center  combined.  Thus  we plan to 
approach  and recruit  at least  100 patients  for our study.  The secondary  outcome  measures  are 
the proportion  of patients  with severe  pain (FLACC  score  ≥7), the average  use of breakthrough  
pain medication,  and all adverse  events.  Thus,  if the hypothesis  is correct,  we anticipate  no 
significant  difference  with using  the alternating  versus  combined  pain regimen  in pediatric  patients

regimen  with ease  of use amongst  caregivers.     
 
8.  Potential  Risks  
8.1. Breach  of confidentiality  
 There  is minimal  risk associated  with the collection  and recording  of patient  medical  record  
numbers  to permit  review  of the patient’s  medical  record.  
 
MyCap  App Security:  
Participant  data is stored  locally  on the device  in an AES-256+SHA2  encrypted  database.  Data  
remains  on the device  if an internet  connection  is not available.  Applies  to both iOS and Android  
devices.  
 
When  an internet  connection  is available,  data is transmitted  to REDCap  using  an SSL 
connection.  A hash -based  message  authentication  code  (HMAC)  is used  to verify  the integrity  of 
the data and to authenticate  the sender.  
 
Data  is deleted  from the device  after the MyCap  app verifies  that data has been  successfully  
transmitted.   
 
Authentication  to Device:  
Participants  create  a 6-digit PIN that is used  to open  the MyCap,  this is in addition  to the 
authentication  already  on their device.  
 
8.2. Combined  acetaminophen  and ibuprofen  risk 
 There  is minimal  risk associated  with either  acetaminophen  or ibuprofen.  The American  
Academy  of Otolaryngology -Head  and Neck  Surgery  Foundation  makes  a strong  
recommendation  that “clinicians  should  recommend  ibuprofen,  acetaminophen,  or both for pain 
control  after tonsillectomy .”[ADDRESS_2189] to be removed from the study or may be removed by [CONTACT_2364].  
Regarding  confidentiality; 1) all subjects will be assigned a study ID number, 2) The link 
to identifiers will be destroyed at the end of the study. 3) Data will be stored under lock and key 
(offic e, file cabinet) and only the investigators and research team will have access. If data are 
published, there will be no link to identifiers. Study data will not be revealed  to any organization, 
individuals other than the subject s, or the subjects themselve s. 4) Study data will not be entered 
in subjects' medical records.

The investigator  will closely  monitor  subjects  for evidence  of adverse  events.   All adverse  
events  will be reported  and followed  until satisfactory  resolution.   The description  of the adverse  
experience  will include  the time of onset,  duration,  intensity,  etiology,  relationship  to the study  
drug (none,  unlikely,  possible,  probable,  highly  probable),  and any treatment  required.  
 
9.2. Premature  Discontinuation  
If a subject  withdraws  from the study,  the subject  will be replaced  to provide  the required  
number  of subjects.  Subjects  will be withdrawn  if the investigator  decides  that discontinuation  is 
in the best interest  of the subject,  or the subject  requests  withdrawal  from the study.  
 
 
 
 
10.  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Plan  
Studies  conducted  in the Department  of Anesthesiology  follow  the Washington  University  
Institutional  Review  Board  Policies  and Procedures  (last revision  January  21, 2019). All 
individuals  working  on the study  are required  to read and be familiar  with and compliant  with the 
IRB Policies  and Procedures.  The specific  monitoring  plan for this investigation  is commensurate  
with the risks and the size and complexity  of the investigations  planned.  The potential  risks are 
attributable  to the use of ibuprofen  and acetaminophen . Based  on the small  size and relatively  
low risk nature  of the protocol,  the investigating  physicians  are involved  in the monitoring  plan.  A 
full DSMB  is not needed . These  individuals  will review  the annual  summary  of adverse  events.  In 
addition,  they will review  all reports  of a Serious  Adverse  Event,  or an Unexpected  Adverse  Event.  
The investigators  will follow  the requirements  for principle  investigator  reporting  requirements  as 
outlined  in Section  X of the IRB Policies  and Procedures.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
 
This is a research study.  We invite you  to participate in this research study because you  are scheduled to 
undergo a tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy at St. Louis Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (SCLH) and 
the Children’s Specialty Care Center (CSCC).  
 
The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of a combined regimen of 
acetaminophen and ibuprofen dosed every [ADDRESS_2193] -operative tonsillectomy pain . 
 
Acetaminophen and ibuprofen  are approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Admin istration to reduce pain 
and fever.  
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THIS STUDY?  
 
You will be randomized (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to either : 
 the alternating medication regimen which is the current practice of alternating doses of

day 3 (POD 3) ; or  
 the combined medication regimen  which is a combined dose of acetaminophen a nd ibuprofen 
every [ADDRESS_2195] of care, all patients will receive a single dose of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen 
during surgery.  
 
The alternating treatment group will receive the first dose of oral ibuprofen [ADDRESS_2196] -anesthesia care 
unit (PACU) with all subsequent doses given as a combination of oral acetaminophen and ibuprof en 
every [ADDRESS_2197] awakening, at 30 minutes, and then hourly after 
PACU arrival, as well a s at the time of discharge and prior to administration of rescue medication  
(medicine intended to relieve your symptoms immediately)  if rescue medication is needed.  
 
Follow up surveys to assess pain scores will be completed  twice a day on post -op days 1, 3, and 7.  
 
In the event you don’t have an email address or access to a smartphone or computer, you will be sent 
home with a copy of the surveys and the study team will call you to obtain your responses.  
 
You will record the  timing of acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and the use of any breakthrough pain  
medication in a paper journal provided to you. Upon completion of the study medication regimen, at the 
end of POD 3, you may continue to provide pain relieving medications as nee ded using whichever 
regimen you prefer. You will continue to record medication usage and timing and pain scores through 
POD 7.  
 
We will collect information about you and your medical history as it relates to the surgery from your 
medical record  for up to [ADDRESS_2198] my  research information to use in future research studies?  
 
We would like to use th e data we are obtaining in this study for studies going on right now as well as 
studies that are conducted in the future.  These studies may provide additional information that will be 
helpful in understanding post-tonsilectomy pain management in pediatric patients  or other diseases or

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THIS STUDY?  
You may experience one or more  of the risks indicated below from being in this study. In addition to 
these, there may be other unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate, associated with being in this 
study.  
 
Ibuprofen   
Allergy alert - May cause severe allergic reaction, espec ially in people allergic to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  Symptoms 
may include:  
 Hives  
 Facial swelling  
 Asthma (wheezing)  
 Shock  
 Skin reddening  
 Rash  
 Blisters  
 
If an allergic reaction occurs, stop use and seek medical help right away.  
 
Stomach bleeding warning – ibuprofen contains NSAID, which may cause severe stomach bleeding.  
The chance is higher if you:  
 Have had stomach ulcers or bleeding problems  
 Take a blood thinning or steroid drug  
 Take other drugs containing prescription or nonprescription NSAIDs (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], ibuprofen, 
naproxen or others)  
 Take more or for a longer time than directed  
 
Heart attack and stroke warning – NSAIDs, except aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], increase the risk of heart attack, heart f ailure, 
and stroke.  These can be fatal.  The risk is higher if you use more than directed or for longer than 
directed.  
 
Acetaminophen  
Liver warning - Severe liver damage may occur if you use more than directed. In case of overdose, get  
medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away (1 -[PHONE_057]).

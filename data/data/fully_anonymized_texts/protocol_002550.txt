 [ADDRESS_490763] acute care skilled 
nursing facilities (SNFs) in the Repi[INVESTIGATOR_391060], i.e., presenting preferred SNFs (P -SNFs) 
first, increases selection of, and discharges to, P -SNFs and de creases lengths of stay (LoS) for 
Geisinger patients discharged to SNFs. Along with the order of P -SNFs, the study also 
assesses whether a short video reviewing the benefits of care coordination in P -SNFs increases 
patient election to transfer to one.  
 
Randomization  
 
Case managers were randomized to one of two conditions  upon their account creation  (Default 
List vs. P -SNF Top -Sorted List) . Patients were  independently  randomized to one of two 
conditions when Repi[INVESTIGATOR_391061] (Full List/Full Map/Default Video vs. P -
SNF List/P -SNF Map/P -SNF Video).  
 
Project Status  
 
All interventions were launched on 5/28/[ADDRESS_490764] not been examined  as a function of experimental condition . However,  only patients who 
are ultimately discharged to a SNF can be included in our analyses , and not all randomized 
patients are ultimately discharged to SNFs (e.g., patients who were discharged home, despi[INVESTIGATOR_391062] a SNF).  So, to assess enrollment progress  throughout the study , 
we need to extract data on patients’ discharge locations and remove patients who were not 
discharged to a SNF.  
 
Our original primary outcome time frame was 12 months or as long as it takes to reach 
N=4,000, whichever occurs first. However, we decided to extend our outcome time frame to  24 
months  or as long as  it takes to reach N=5,000 patients. We made this change  because we 
noticed an imbalance in the number of case managers assigned to the two conditions , such that 
by [CONTACT_3364], there were more active case managers in the P-SNF top -sorted  condition (N = 104 
as of 1/2/23) compared with the default list  condition  (N = 70 as of 1/2/23). We ran a simulation 
power analysis to reassess how many patients should be in our final sample size , given the 
imbalance in case manager assignment, and determined that 5,[ADDRESS_490765] a 4% increase in P -SNF selection .  
 
However, by [CONTACT_391069], enrollment 
exceeded 5,000 patients . We plan to include all eligible patients enrolled through 1/2/[ADDRESS_490766] 
80% power to detect a 4% increase  (34% to 38%)  in selection  of P-SNFs  at two-tailed p < .05 .

Analys is Approach  
 
Analyses described below represent our planned analyses assuming statistical assumptions are 
met. If assumptions are not met, we will run alternative tests appropriate for the outcome 
distribution (e.g., non -parametric tests) . 
 
Recent work suggests that OLS regressions are appropriate in randomized experiments with 
binary outcome v ariables such as ours (Gomilla, 2021). Therefore, for binary outcome variables, 
we default to running OLS regressions.  
 
Some of our originally preregistered outcome descriptions mentioned comparing Time 1, before 
the Repi[INVESTIGATOR_391063], to Time 2,  during the study, after launch of the app. Upon 
learning that it is infeasible to obtain comparable Time 1 measurements and include them in 
analysis, we decided to omit Time 1 to focus analyses entirely on comparing outcomes during 
the study period (i.e.,  the primary causal investigation).  
 
Primary Outcomes  
 
P1: Overall LoS (system/case manager level) [ Time Frame: 24 months  or as long as it takes to 
reach N= 5,000, whichever occurs first  ] 
 
Difference in LoS (in days) for patients  as a function of  case manager  study condition  
 
Analysi s: We will run a gamma regression to test whether  LoS differs between  patients with a 
case manager in Default List versus  P-SNF Top -Sorted groups.  
 
 
P2: P -SNF placement (system/case manager level) [ Time Frame: 24 months  or as long as it 
takes to reach N= 5,000, whichever occurs first ]  
 
Difference  in proportion of discharges of patients to P -SNFs (out of P -SNFs + NP -SNFs) as a 
function of case manager study condition .  
 
Analysi s: We will run a  beta regression to test whether there is a difference in the proportion of 
patient discharges to P -SNFs  for the case manager Default List and P -SNF Top -Sorted groups.  
 
 
P3: P-SNF pre -selection (case manager level) [ Time Frame: 24 months  or as long as it takes to 
reach N= 5,000, whichever occurs first ]  
 
Number of P -SNFs selected by [CONTACT_391070]' lists, to assess the 
direct impact of Repi[INVESTIGATOR_391064]; this is the first decision in the 
process, before patients' selections and SNF availability factor into the final discharge decision 
and placement.  
 
Analysis : We will run a negative binomial  regression to test whether the number of P -SNFs pre -
selected differs as a function of case manager study arm , clustering standard errors at the case 
manager level.  
 
 
 4 
P4: P-SNF selection (case manager level) [ Time Frame: 24 months  or as long as it takes to 
reach N= 5,000, whichever occurs first ]  
 
Number of P -SNFs selected by [CONTACT_391071][INVESTIGATOR_391065] -selection, again omitting the influence 
of SN F availability.  
 
Analysis : We will run a negative binomial regression to test whether the number of P -SNFs 
selected differs as a function of case manager condition, clustering standard errors at the case 
manager level.  
 
Note : Retrospective data prior to the study period suggested that only ~15% of patients indicate 
their selections in the Repi[INVESTIGATOR_391066]. Therefore, data will be missing for many patients in this 
analysis.  However, we will run this analysis on patients with avai lable data.  
 
 
P5: P-SNF percent selected (case manager level) [ Time Frame: 24 months  or as long as it 
takes to reach N= 5,000, whichever occurs first ]  
 
Percentage of patients who selected at least one P -SNF, to help assess the downstream impact 
of Repi[INVESTIGATOR_391067] -selection.  
 
Analysis : We will run a beta  regression to test whether the percentage of patients who selected 
one or more  P-SNFs differs  as a function of case manager  condition, clustering standard errors 
at the case manager level.  
 
Note : Retrospective data prior to the study period suggested that only ~15% of patients indicate 
their selections in the Repi[INVESTIGATOR_391066]. Therefore, data will be missing for many patients in this 
analysis.  However, we will run this analysis on patients with avai lable data.  
 
 
P6: LoS (patient/caretaker level) [ Time Frame: 24 months  or as long as it takes to reach 
N=4,000, whichever occurs first ]  
 
LoS for patients (in days).  
 
Analysis:  We will run a gamma regression to test whether LoS differs as a function of patient 
condition , clustering standard errors at the case manager level.

reach N= 5,000, whichever occurs first ]

Analysis:  We will run an OLS regression to test whether patient P -SNF placement rates  differ  as 
a function of patient condition, clustering standard errors at the case manager level.  
 
 
P8: P-SNF selection (patient/caretaker level) [ Time Frame: 24 months  or as long as it takes to 
reach N= 5,000, whichever occurs first ]  
 5 
 
Patient selected a P-SNF for discharge: yes/no. This is a more direct reflection of patient 
behavior, not yet moderated by [CONTACT_391072] -world considerations that affect 
Outcome 7.   
 
Analysis:  We will run an OLS regression to test whether patient P -SNF sele ction rates differ as 
a function of patient condition, clustering standard errors at the case manager level.  
 
Note : Retrospective data prior to the study period suggested that only ~15% of patients indicate 
their selections in the Repi[INVESTIGATOR_391066]. Therefore , data will be missing for many patients in this 
analysis. However, we will run this analysis on patients with available data.

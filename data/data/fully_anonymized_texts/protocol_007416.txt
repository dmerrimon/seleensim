Introduction  
 
Immunotherapy  with checkpoint  inhibition  is improving  long-term disease  control  for patients  
with diverse  malignancies  (Tolapi[CONTACT_1629]  2012;  Hamid  2013;  Wolchok  2013;  Powles  2014),  
including  patients  with ovarian  cancer  (OC)  (Hodi  2008;  Brahmer  2012).  The primary  
mediators  of adaptive  immune  blockade,  whose  targeting  in clinical  trials have  yielded  
results,  include  CTLA -4 (Hodi  2010;  Ribas  2013),  PD-1 (Topalian  2012;  Hamid  2013;  Robert  
2014),  and PD-L1 (Brahmer  2012).  Responses  in tumors  such  as melanoma,  non-small  cell 
lung cancer,  and renal  cell cancer  have been  impressive.  Preclinical  data point  toward  an 
important  role of TIL‟s in OC. (Zhang  2003;  Sato 2005;  Hamanishi  2007)  Emerging  human  
data in OC demonstrate  more  modest  yet encouraging  activity  of immune  checkpoint  
inhibitors  (Hodi  2008;  Brahmer  2012).  
Checkpoint  Inhibition  in OC 
 
Programmed  cell death  ligand  1 (PD-L1) is part of a complex  system  of receptors  and 
ligands  that are involved  in controlling  T-cell activation.  PD-L1 acts at multiple  sites in the 
body to help regulate  normal  immune  responses  and is utilized  by [CONTACT_498259].  In the lymph  nodes,  
PD-L1 on antigen -presenting  cells binds  to PD-1 or CD80  on activated  T cells and delivers  
an inhibitory  signal  to the T cell (Keir et al, 2008;  Park et al, 2010).  This results  in reduced  T- 
cell activation  and fewer  activated  T cells in circulation.  In the tumor  microenvironment,  PD- 
L1 expressed  on tumor  cells binds  to PD-1 and CD80  on activated  T cells reaching  the 
tumor.  This delivers  an inhibitory  signal  to those  T cells,  preventing  them  from killing  target  
cancer  cells and protecting  the tumor  from immune  elimination  (Zou and Chen,  2008).  
 
In one preclinical  study,  the 5-year survival  rate in OC patients  with low expression  of PD-L1 
was 80.2%  compared  with 52.6%  in patients  with high expression  levels  of PD-L1 
(Hamanishi  et al. 2007).  In a Phase  2 study  of 20 heavily -pretreated  patients  with platinum  
resistant  OC, nivolumab  (anti-PD-1) at 2 dose  levels  yielded  an ORR  of 15%;  and a 45% 
disease  control  rate; responses  were  durable  for 2 disease  assessments  beyond  the end of 
treatment  in the 2 patients  with CR (Hamanishi  2015).  On the heels  of these  results,  a 
randomized  CTEP  trial of nivolumab  alone  or in combination  with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_498223].  
 
 
Durvalumab: anti-PD-L1 Monoclonal Antibody 
 
Durvalumab, formerly called MEDI4736 , is a human mAb of the IgG1κ subclass that inhibits 
binding  of PD-L1 to PD-[ADDRESS_640746]  the potential  to trigger  effector  functions  such  as ADCC  
and CDC.  However,  durvalumab  carries  3 point mutations  in its constant  domain  that reduce  
binding  to C1q as well as the affinity  of the Fc domain  for the ADCC-inducing Fcγ receptors  
(Oganesyan  et al, 2008).  
 
Preclinical  analyses  reveal  the following  features:

• Durvalumab  binds  to PD-L1 and blocks  its interaction  with PD-1 and CD80  
• In vitro, durvalumab  can relieve  PD-L1-mediated  suppression  of human  T-cell 
activation  
• Durvalumab  does not trigger  ADCC  or CDC  in cell-based  functional  assays  
• Durvalumab  inhibits  tumor  growth  in a xenograft  model  via a T-cell dependent  
mechanism  
• An anti-mouse  PD-L1 antibody  demonstrated  improved  survival  in a syngeneic  tumor  
model  when  given  as monotherapy  and resulted  in complete  tumor  regression  in > 
50% of treated  mice  when  given  in combination  with chemotherapy  
 
To date,  several  hundred  patients  with a range  of solid tumors  have been  treated  on 
integrated  monotherapy  studies  with durvalumab.  These  trials (CD-ON-MEDI4736 -1108,  
D4190C00002,  and D4190C00007)  have  yielded  information  on clinical  safety,  efficacy,  and 
PK, as summarized  below.  (Investigato r‟s Brochure , durvalumab  (MEDI4736),  vol. 8.0) 
 
Pharmacokinetics  
 
Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736 -1108: As of 09Feb2015,  PK data were  available  for 378 subjects   
in the dose -escalation  and dose-expansion  phases  of Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736 -1108  
following  treatment  with durvalumab  0.1 to 10 mg/kg  every  2 weeks  (Q2W)  or 15 mg/kg   
every  3 weeks  (Q3W).  The maximum  observed  concentration  (Cmax)  increased  in an 
approximately  dose -proportional  manner  over the dose  range  of 0.1 to 15 mg/kg.  The area 
under  the concentration -time curve  from 0 to 14 days (AUC0 -14) increased  in a greater  than 
dose-proportional  manner  over the dose  range  of 0.1 to 3 mg/kg  and increased   dose - 
proportionally  at ≥ 3 mg/kg.  These  results  suggest  durvalumab  exhibits  nonlinear  PK likely  
due to saturable  target -mediated  CL at doses  < 3 mg/kg  and approaches  linearity  at doses  ≥ 
3 mg/kg.  Near complete  target  saturation  (soluble  programmed  cell death  ligand  1 [sPD -L1] 
and membrane  bound)  is expected  with durvalumab  ≥ 3 mg/kg  Q2W.  Exposures  after 
multiple  doses  showed  accumulation  consistent  with PK parameters  estimated  from the first 
dose.  In addition,  PK simulations  indicate  that following  durvalumab  10 mg/kg  Q2W  dosing,  > 
90% of subjects  are expected  to maintain  PK exposure  ≥ 40 μg/mL  throughout  the dosing  
interval.  
 
As of 09Feb2015,  a total of 388 subjects  provided  samples  for anti-drug antibody  (ADA)  
analysis.  Only 8 of 388 subjects  ([ADDRESS_640748]  each  in 0.1, 1, 3, and 15 mg/kg  cohorts,  and 4 
subjects  in 10 mg/kg  cohort)  were  ADA positive  with an impact  on PK/pharmacodynamics  in 
[ADDRESS_640749]  in the 3 mg/kg  cohort.  
 
Safety  
 
The safety  profile  of durvalumab  as monotherapy  and combined  with other  anticancer  agents  
was consistent  with the pharmacology  of the target  and other  agents  in the immune  
checkpoint  inhibitor  class.  No tumor  types  appeared  to be associated  with unique  AEs. 
Immune -related  AEs (irAEs),  which  are important  risks of immune  checkpoint  inhibitors,  have  
been  observed  with durvalumab  and include  colitis,  pneumonitis,  hepatitis/hepatotoxicity,  
neuropathy/neuromuscular  toxicity,  endocrinopathy,  dermatitis,  and nephritis.  In addition,  
pancreatitis  is an important  potential  risk particularly  with durvalumab  and tremelimumab

(anti-CTLA -4) combination  therapy.  These  events  are manageable  by [CONTACT_213174]/established  
treatment  guidelines  as described  in the study  protocols.  
Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736 -1108:  The safety  profile  of durvalumab  monotherapy  in the 694 
subjects  with advanced  solid tumors  treated  at 10 mg/kg  Q2W  in Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736 - 
[ADDRESS_640751] received  
durvalumab  monotherapy  (not including  subjects  treated  with blinded  investigational  product)  
across  the clinical  development  program.  The majority  of treatment -related  AEs were  
manageable  with dose  delays,  symptomatic  treatment,  and in the case  of events  suspected  
to have an immune  basis,  the use of established  treatment  guidelines  for immune -mediated  
toxicity.  As of 07May2015,  among  the 694 subjects  treated  with durvalumab  10 mg/kg  Q2W  
in Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736 -1108,  a total of 378 subjects  (54.5%)  experienced  a treatment - 
related  AE, with the most  frequent  (occurring  in ≥ 5% of subjects)  being  fatigue  (17.7%),  
nausea  (8.6%),  diarrhea  (7.3%),  decreased  appetite  (6.8%),  pruritus  (6.3%),  rash (6.1%),   
and vomiting  (5.0%).  A majority  of the treatment -related  AEs were  Grade  1 or Grade  2 in 
severity  with ≥ Grade  3 events  occurring  in 65 subjects  (9.4%).  
 
Treatment -related  ≥ Grade  3 events  reported  in 3 or more  subjects  (≥ 0.4%)  were  fatigue  (12 
subjects,  1.7%);  increased  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST;  7 subjects,  1.0%);   increased  
gamma -glutamyltransferase  (GGT;  6 subjects,  0.9%);  increased  alanine  aminotransferase  
(ALT;  5 subjects,  0.7%);  and colitis,  vomiting,  decreased  appetite,  and hyponatremia  (3 
subjects,  0.4%  each).  Six subjects  had treatment -related  Grade  4 AEs (upper  gastrointestinal  
hemorrhage,  increased  AST,  dyspnea,  neutropenia,  colitis,  diarrhea,  and pneumonitis)  and [ADDRESS_640752]  had a treatment -related  Grade  5 event  (pneumonia).  Treatment -related  serious  
adverse  events  (SAEs)  that occurred  in ≥ 2 subjects  were  colitis  and pneumonitis  (3 subjects  
each).  A majority  of the treatment -related  SAEs  were  ≥ Grade  3 in severity  and resolved  with 
or without  sequelae.  AEs that resulted  in permanent  discontinuation  of durvalumab  were  
considered  as treatment  related  in 18 subjects  (2.6%),  with colitis  being  the most  frequent  
treatment -related  AE resulting  in discontinuation  (3 subjects).  A majority  of the treatment - 
related  AEs resulting  in discontinuation  of durvalumab  were  ≥ Grade  3 in severity  and 
resolved  with or without  sequelae.  
Study D4191 C0000 3/ATLANTIC: The safety profile of durvalumab monotherapy in Study 
CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 is gene rally consistent with that of Study D4191 C00003/ATLANTIC 
in subjects  with locally  advanced  or metastatic  non-small  cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  treated  
with durvalumab  10 mg/kg  Q2W.  As of 05May2015,  264 of 303 subjects  (87.1%)  reported  
any AE in Study  D4191C00003/ATLANTIC.  Overall,   events  reported  in ≥ 10% of subjects

Efficacy  
 
Partial  efficacy  data are available  for 2 monotherapy  studies  (CD-ON-MEDI4736 -1108  and 
D4190C00007).  
Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736 -1108:  Overall,  456 of 694 subjects  treated  with durvalumab  10 
mg/kg  Q2W  were  evaluable  for response  (defined  as having  ≥ 24 weeks  follow -up, 
measurable  disease  at baseline,  and ≥ 1 follow -up scan,  or discontinued  due to  disease  
progression  or death  without  any follow -up scan).  In PD-L1 unselected  patients,  the objective  
response  rate (ORR),  based  on investigator  assessment  per Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in 
Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  v1.1, ranged  from 0% in uveal  melanoma  (n = 23) to 20.0%  in 
bladder  cancer  (n = 15), and disease  control  rate at 24 weeks  (DCR -24w)  ranged  from 4.2%  
in triple-negative  breast  cancer  (TNBC;  n = 24) to 39.1%  in advanced  cutaneous  melanoma  
(n = 23). PD-L1 status  was known  for [ADDRESS_640757]  for bladder  cancer,  advanced  cutaneous  
melanoma,  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC;  n = 3 each,  33.3%  each),  NSCLC  (n = 86, 
26.7%),  and squamous  cell carcinoma  of the head  and neck (SCCHN;  n = 22, 18.2%).  In the 
PD-L1-positive  subset,  DCR -24w was highest  in advanced  cutaneous  melanoma  (n = 3, 
66.7%),  NSCLC  (n = 86, 36.0%),  HCC  and bladder  cancer  (n = 3 each,  33.3%  each),  and 
SCCHN  (n = 22, 18.2%).  
Study  D4190C00007:  Of the 32 subjects  with myelodysplastic  syndrome  (MDS)  treated  in 
Study  D4190C00007,  [ADDRESS_640758] overall  responses  were  marrow  complete  remission  (mCR)  in 4 
subjects  (19.0%);  stable  disease  (SD) in 4 subjects  (19.0%);  and progressive  disease  (PD) in 
5 subjects  (23.8%).  The remaining  8 subjects  (38.1%)  did not meet  the criteria  for complete  
remission  (CR),  mCR,  partial  remission  (PR),  SD, or PD at the date of assessment.

A population  PK model  was developed  for durvalumab  using  monotherapy   data  from  a 
Phase  1 study  (study  1108;  N=292;  doses=  0.1 to 10 mg/kg  Q2W  or 15 mg/kg  Q3W;  solid 
tumors ). Population  PK analysis  indicated  only minor  impact  of body  weight  (WT)  on PK of 
durvalumab  (coefficient  of ≤ 0.5). The impact  of body WT-based  (10 mg/kg  Q2W)  and fixed 
dosing  (750 mg Q2W)  of durvalumab  was evaluated  by [CONTACT_498263]  (5th, median  and 95th percentiles)  using  the population  PK model.  A fixed 
dose  of 750 mg was selected  to approximate  10 mg/kg  (based  on median  body WT of ~75 
kg). A total of 1000  patients  were  simulated  using  body WT distribution  of 40–[ADDRESS_640760] been  reported  by [CONTACT_2312]  [Ng et al 2006,  Wang  et al. 2009,  Zhang  et al, 
2012,Narwal  et al 2013].  Wang  and colleagues  investigated  12 monoclonal  antibodies  and 
found  that fixed and body size-based  dosing  perform  similarly,  with fixed dosing  being  better  
for 7 of 12 antibodies  [3]. In addition,  they investigated  [ADDRESS_640761]  variability  in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics  parameters  [Zhang  et al 2012].  
 
A fixed dosing  approach  is preferred  by [CONTACT_498264].  Given  expectation  of similar  pharmacokinetic  exposure  and variability,  
we considered  it feasible  to switch  to fixed dosing  regimens.  Based  on average  body  WT of 
75 kg, a fixed dose  of 750 mg Q2W  durvalumab  (equivalent  to 10 mg/kg  Q2W),  1500  mg 
Q4W  durvalumab  (equivalent  to 20 mg/kg  Q4W)  is included   in  the  current   study.   Fixed  
dosing  of durvalumab  is recommend  only for subjects  with > 30kg body weight  due to 
endotoxin  exposure.  Patients  with a body weight  less than or equal  to 30 kg should  be 
dosed  using  a weight -based  dosing  schedule  (Appendix  A). 
 
 
FRα and the FRα Vaccine  TPIV200  
 
One reason  that responses  in OC appear  to be less robust  than for other  solid tumors  may 
be its relatively  low mutational  burden  (TCGA  2011).  The success of immune  checkpoint  
inhibition  may partly  relate  to the breadth  of the mutational  landscape  (Rizvi  2015),  with 
melanoma  and NSCLC  having  the highest  mutation  loads  among  solid tumors,  providing  a 
feast  of immunologic  targets.  Mutational  load and neoantigen  landscape  may be predictive  of 
response  to CTLA -4 inhibitors  in patients  with melanoma  (Snyder  2014).  
 
An important  question  in OC is whether  the efficacy  of checkpoint  inhibition  can be improved  
by [CONTACT_498265].  Only a few tumor -associated  antigens  (TAAs)  have been  
identified  in OC. One notable  example  is the folate  receptor  alpha  (FRα), which  presents  an 
compelling  opportunity  for targeted  immunotherapy.  The human  FRα is over-expressed  in a 
majority  of ovarian  cancers  (70-90%),  but is rarely  found  in healthy  adult tissues.  While  it is a 
self antigen,  several  promiscuous  epi[INVESTIGATOR_498224]α have been  identified  to prompt  a T cell 
response  in 70% of patients  with ovarian  and breast  cancers  (Knutson  2006).

Based  on these  observations,  a multi-epi[INVESTIGATOR_498219]-FRα vaccine  (huFR -1 or TPIV200  – 
TapI[INVESTIGATOR_448549],  Inc.) was developed  by [CONTACT_498266]α identified  in a group  of un-vaccinated  patients  with OC and breast  cancer,  as compared  
with normal  volunteers.  Using  these  5 oligopeptide  antigens,  TPIV200  was designed,  
generated,  and validated  in animal  models,  and subsequently  tested  in human  subjects  
(Investigators  Brochure,  TPIV200,  TapI[INVESTIGATOR_448549],  Inc.).  
 
In a phase  [ADDRESS_640763]  cancer  were  vaccinated  with 
TPIV200  admixed  GM-CSF in a single  syringe.  (Proc  ASCO  2015)  One cycle  of 
cyclophosphamide  was given  in an effort  to reduce  T-regs.  The safety  profile  of TPIV200  was 
excellent.  Immune  responses  were  measured,  using  IFN-γ ELIspot  assays  in the [ADDRESS_640764] not yielded  benefits,  the validity  of FRα as a 
therapeutic  target  for OC has been  bolstered  by [CONTACT_498267]  (IMGN853),  in recurrent  OC in a phase  1 trial reported  at ASCO  
2015.  IMGN853  is an antibody -mytansoid  conjugate,  which  is FRα-specific  (Ab 2015;  Moore  
2015).  Levels  of FRα measured  by [CONTACT_498268].  
Although  FRα can be detected  in small  amounts  in healthy  adult  lung and kidney,  pulmonary  
toxicities  were  rare and renal  toxicity  was not observed.  
 
 
Furthermore  no significant  pulmonary  or renal  toxicity  was encountered  in studies  using  
farletuzumab  (Konner  2010),  an anti-FRα MAb,  shown  to induce  ADCC  in preclinical  models,  
despi[INVESTIGATOR_498225] -targeting  (Smith -Jones  2008);  nor was such  
toxicity  seen  in clinical  trials with vintafolide,  a folate -vinca  conjugate,  also demonstrated  to 
home  to tumors  by [CONTACT_186355] -imaging  SPECT  studies  (Naumann  2013).  
Hypothesis  
 
In clinical  trials,  peptide  vaccines  have demonstrated  measurable  immunogenicity  in OC 
patients  vaccinated  against  the FRα as well as other  TAA's.  Vaccines  alone  however  have   
yet to demonstrate  compelling  evidence  of clinical  efficacy  (Tse 2014).  For this study,  we 
hypothesize  that the therapeutic  potential  of anti-cancer  vaccines  is hindered  by [CONTACT_498269],  and furthermore  that immune  
checkpoint  inhibition  may overcome  these  restraints.  In the proposed  study,  patients  with 
platinum  resistant  OC will be vaccinated  with TPIV200  and given  concurrent  durvalumab.  It is 
expected  that these  agents  will be tolerable  at full doses  of each,  given  their mild, and non- 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_498226].  Safety  and efficacy  will be evaluated.  Immunologic  assays  will  
be utilized  to characterize  the specific  cellular  and humoral  immune  responses  generated

4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is an MSKCC  investigator -initiated,  single -center,  non-randomized,  open -label,  phase  
2 study  to evaluate  the activity  of TPIV200  + durvalumab  in patients  with recurrent  or 
persistent  platinum  resistant  OC. The safety  and tolerability  of this doublet  will also be 
evaluated.  
 
Each  cycle  will be 28 days in duration.  Patients  will receive  study  treatment  until disease  
progression,  intolerable  toxicity,  elective  withdrawal  from the study,  study  completion,  or 
study  termination.  
 
Efficacy  assessments  will be performed  every  3 cycles  (or 12 weeks)  from initiation  of study  
treatment  until disease  progression  is documented.  
 
Safety  will be evaluated  through  the monitoring  of all serious  and non-serious  AEs and 
irAE‟s, graded  according  to the current  version  of National  Cancer  Institute ‟s Common  
Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE  v. 4.03).  A safety  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_498228].  
 
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Eligible  patients  will undergo  screening  and baseline  procedures  per the Study  Schedule.  
Study  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  will be applied  per section  6.0. Enrolled  patients  will 
receive  durvalumab  IV (intravenous  Sec on Days  1 and 15) during  Cycles  1-12 and 
TPIV200+GM -CSF ID (3 intradermal  injections  on Day 1) during  Cycles  1-6. Each  cycle  will 
be 28 days in duration.  Patients  will receive  study  treatment  until disease  progression,  
intolerable  toxicity,  elective  withdrawal  from the study,  study  completion,  or study  termination.  
Efficacy  assessments  will be performed  at the initiation  of study  treatment  and then every  3 
cycles  (or 12 weeks)  until radiologic  and/or  clinical  disease  progression.  Patients  who 
discontinue  treatment  for reasons  other  than progression  may continue  efficacy  assessments  
until progression  is demonstrated.  Patients  who demonstrate  radiologic  progression  by 
[CONTACT_498270]  (but not primary  efficacy  analysis)   
if they are deemed  to be clinically  benefiting,  according  to predetermined  permitted  criteria  
(section  12.4).  Safety  will be evaluated  in this study  through  the monitoring  of all serious  and 
non-serious  AEs and irAEs,  graded  according  to the current  version  of the National  Cancer  
Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTC  v.4.03).  
The order  of administration  on Days  1 of Cycles  1-6 is durvalumab  followed  by [CONTACT_498271]200.  
Durvalumab  (750mg)  will be infused  IV over 1 hour on Days  1 and 15 of Cycles  1-12. On 
Cycle  1 Day 1, TPIV200  should  be administered  as soon  as possible  after the 60 (+/-5) min 
post-infusion  vital sign check.  For subsequent  doses,  post-infusion  vitals  are not required  
(unless  patient  has experienced  hypersensitivity  to durvalumab),  and TPIV200  should  be 
administered  as soon  as possible  after the end of durvalumab  infusion.

Durvalumab  is formulated  at 50 mg/mL  in 26 mM histidine/histidine -HCl, 275 m M trehalose  
dihydrate,  0.02%  (w/v)  polysorbate  80, pH 6.0. 
 
The investigational  product  is supplied  as a vialed  liquid  solution  in clear  10R glass  vials 
closed  with an elastomeric  stopper  and a flip-off cap overseal.  Each  vial contains  500 mg 
(nominal)  of active  investigational  product  at a concentration  of 50 mg/mL  (500 mg/vial).  The 
solution  will be diluted  with 0.9%  (w/v)  saline  for IV infusion.  
 
Unopened  vials of liquid  durvalumab  must  be stored  at 2°C to 8°C (36°F  to 46°F).  
Durvalumab  must  be used  within  the individually  assigned  expi[INVESTIGATOR_232220].  
In use storage  and stability  
 
Total  in-use storage  time from needle  puncture  of durvalumab  vial to start of administration  
should  not exceed  4 hours  at room  temperature  or 24 hours  at 2-8°C (36-46°F).  If in-use 
storage  time exceeds  these  limits,  a new dose  must  be prepared  from new vials.  Infusion  
solutions  must  be allowed  to equilibrate  to room  temperature  prior to commencement  of 
administration.  Durvalumab  does not contain  preservatives  and any unused  portion  must  be 
discarded. 
 
 
Study  drug  preparation  
 
Calculate  the dose  volume  of durvalumab  and number  of vials needed  for the subject  to 
achieve  the accurate  dose  of 750mg.  
Preparation  of infusion  bags  
 
The preparation  of infusion  bags should  be done  under  aseptic  conditions  by [CONTACT_362959];  it should  not be prepared  on the ward.  
 
An additional  volume  of 0.9%  (w/v)  saline  equal  to the calculated  volume  of durvalumab  to be 
added  to the IV bag must  be removed  from the bag prior to addition  of durvalumab.  
 
The calculated  volume  of durvalumab  is then added  to the IV bag, and the bag is mixed  by 
[CONTACT_498274]. 
Prior to the start of the infusion,  ensure  that the bag contents  are at room  temperature  to 
avoid  an infusion  reaction  due to the administration  of the solution  at low temperatures.  
Vials should  be used  for specific  subjects  and should  not be shared  between  subjects.  
 
Patient  weight  at baseline  should  be used  for dosing  calculations  in patients  ≤30 kg unless  
there  is a ≥10%  change  in weight.  Dosing  day weight  can be used  for dosing  calculations  
instead  of baseline  weight  per institutional  standard.  
Dose  administration  
 
Durvalumab  will be administered  at room  temperature  (approximately  25°C  ) by [CONTACT_498275] a peripheral  vein or central  access  device.

Following  preparation  of durvalumab,  the entire  contents   of the IV bag should  be 
administered  as an IV infusion  over approximately  60 minutes  (±5 minutes),  using  a 0.2-μm 
in-line filter.   Less than 55 minutes  is considered  a deviation.  
 
The IV line will be flushed  with a volume  of normal  saline  equal  to the priming  volume  of the 
infusion  set used  after the contents  of the IV bag are fully administered,  or complete  the 
infusion  according  to institutional  policy  to ensure  the full dose  is administered  and document  
if the line was not flushed.  
Since  the compatibility  of durvalumab  with other  IV medications  and solutions,  other  than 
normal  saline  (0.9%  [weight/volume]  sodium  chloride  for injection)  or dextrose,  is not known,  
the durvalumab  solution  should  not be infused  through  an IV line in which  other  solutions  or 
medications  are being  administered.  
Monitoring  of dose  administration  
 
Subjects  will be monitored  during  and after the infusion  with assessment  of vital signs  at the 
times  specified  in the Schedule  of Assessment  (Section  8.0). 
 
In the event  of a Grade  ≤ 2 infusion -related  reaction,  the infusion  rate of study  drug may be 
decreased  by 50%,  or interrupted  until resolution  of the event  (up to 4 hours)  and re-initiated  
at 50% of the initial  rate until completion  of the infusion.  For subjects  with a Grade  ≤ 2 
infusion -related  reaction,  subsequent  infusions  may be administered  at 50% of the initial

• Pregnancy  test (in women  of child bearing  potential)  
• 12 lead ECG  (in triplicate)  
• Research  bloods  
 
Single  tracing  ECGs  should  be taken  within  an hour prior to the start of the infusion  and at least 
one time point  [ADDRESS_640788]  of pre-infusion  Cycle  1 Day 1 ECG,  if it was performed  
within  14 days prior.  
 
ECGs  recorded  during  the screening  period  will be obtained  in triplicate  (with 2-5 minute  lag time 
between  each);  ECGs  recorded  during  the treatment  phase  will be single  tracing.  All 12-lead 
ECGs  should  be recorded  while  the subject  is in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_84740].  A 12-lead ECG  will be 
recorded  for all subjects  on study  days noted  in Section  10.0.  The same method  of assessment  
should  be used  throughout  the study.  Twelve -lead ECGs  will be obtained  after the subject  has 
been  resting  in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_498231]  [ADDRESS_640789] one time point 0 to 3 hours  
after the infusion.  
 
Vital signs  (temperature,  blood  pressure,  pulse  rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842]) will be measured  on 
study  days noted  in the Schedule  of Assessments.  On durvalumab  treatment  days,  vital signs  
will be measured  within  an hour prior to start of durvalumab  administration,  at 30 minutes  during  
the infusion  (± 5 minutes),  at the end of infusion  (+ 5 minutes),  and at 30 minutes  (± 5 minutes)  
and 60 minutes  (± 5 minutes)  post-infusion.  If the infusion  takes  longer  than 60 minutes,  then 
blood  pressure  and pulse  measurements  should  follow  the principles  described  here,  or more  
frequently  if clinically  indicated.  For subsequent  doses  (at dose  levels  of 10 mg/kg  or less),  the 
1-hour observation  period  will not be required  unless  a subject  experiences  an infusion -related  
reaction.

Forty  patients  may be treated.  An initial  safety  lead-in (described  in detail  under  Safety  
Analysis  in Section  14.0)  will require  that at least [ADDRESS_640793]  be staggered  by 3 weeks.  No more  than 3 patients  will be 
enrolled  during  each  3 week  period  thereafter.  
 
All subjects  will receive  TPIV200+GM -CSF and durvalumab.  Each  cycle  will be 28 days in 
duration.  The order  of administration  on Days  1 of Cycles  1-6 is durvalumab  followed  by 
[CONTACT_498271]200.   Patients  will receive  study  treatment  until disease  progression,  intolerable  toxicity,  
elective  withdrawal  from the study,  study  completion,  or study  termination  . 
 
Durvalumab  (750mg)  will be infused  intravenously  (IV) over 1 hour on Days  1 and 15 of 
Cycles  1-12. 
 
TPIV200  (500µg  per peptide)  will be admixed  with 125µg  Granulocyte -macrophage  colony  
stimulating  factor  (GM-CSF)  and injected  intradermally  (ID) on Day 1 of Cycles  1-6. The 
peptide/GM -CSF mixture  will be injected  into at least [ADDRESS_640794] not had lymph  node  dissections  on one 
side, the forearm  on the side without  node  dissections  will be used  unless  the patient  prefers

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
The dose  delay  instructions  provided  in this section  are intended  to serve  as guidelines  to 
allow  ongoing  treatment  for patients  experiencing  clinical  benefit  without  signs  or symptoms  
of progression  while  ensuring  patient  safety.  Patients  may temporarily  suspend  dosing  of 
study  drug for up to 14 days if they experience  toxicity that is considered  related  to study  
drug and requires  that a dose  be held.  Patients  who miss ≥ 28 consecutive  days of 
scheduled  study  treatment  because  of drug-related  AEs will be discontinued  from the study.  
Exceptions  may be made  after discussion  with and approval  by [CONTACT_45822].  
 
Patients  may suspend  dosing  of study  drug for radiation  therapy  or surgery  that is considered  
by [CONTACT_498276].  After completion  of the 
intervention,  patients  may restart  the study  drug as long as all criteria  for dosing  are met and 
there  is no evidence  of disease  progression  (unless  approved  by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_362899]).

• Treat  each  of the toxicities  with maximum  supportive  care (including  holding  the agent  
suspected  of causing  the toxicity  where  required).  
 
• If the symptoms  promptly  resolve  with supportive  care,  consideration  should  be given  to 
continuing  the same  dose  of durvalumab  along  with appropriate  continuing  supportive  care.  
If medically  appropriate,  dose  modifications  are permitted  for durvalumab  (see below).  
 
• All dose  modifications  should  be documented  with clear  reasoning  and documentation  of the 
approach  taken.  
 
• In addition,  there  are certain  circumstances  in which  durvalumab  should  be permanently  
discontinued.  
• Following  the first dose  of durvalumab,  subsequent  administration  of durvalumab  can be 
modified based on toxicities observed (see APPENDIX A).  Dose reductions are not 
permitted . 
• Based  on the mechanism  of action  of durvalumab  leading  to T-cell activation  and 
proliferation,  there  is the possibility  of observing  immune  related  Adverse  Events  (irAEs)  
during  the conduct  of this study.   Potential  irAEs  include  immune -mediated  enterocolitis,  
dermatitis,  hepatitis,  and endocrinopathies.  Subjects  should  be monitored  for signs  and 
symptoms  of irAEs.   In the absence  of an alternate  etiology  (e.g.,  infection  or PD) signs  or 
symptoms  of enterocolitis,  dermatitis,  hepatitis,  and endocrinopathy  should  be considered  to 
be immune -related.  
• Dose  modification  recommendations  and toxicity  management  guidelines  for immune - 
mediated  reactions,  for infusion -related  reactions,  and for non-immune -mediated  reactions  
are detailed  in Tables  1, 2, and 3, respectively.  
 
• In addition,  management  guidelines  for adverse  events  of special  interest  (AESI ‟s) are 
detailed  in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  All toxicities  will be graded  according  to NCI CTCAE  v4.03.

• Grade  3 allergic  reaction,  or higher  with the exception  of fever.  (Grade  2 allergic  reaction  
is defined  as rash,  flushing,  urticaria,  or dyspnea;  Grade  3 allergic  reaction  is defined  as 
symptomatic  bronchospasm,  requiring  parenteral  medication,  with or without  urticaria,  
allergy  related  edema  or angioedema;  Grade  4 allergic  reaction  is defined  as 
anaphylaxis.)  
 
• Grade  2 or higher  autoimmune  reaction  (Grade  2 is defined  as evidence  of autoimmune  
reaction  involving  a non-essential  organ  or function  (e.g. hypothyroidism)  requiring  
treatment  other  than immunosuppressive  drugs.  Grade  3 is a reversible  autoimmune  
reaction  involving  a major  organ  (e.g. colitis)  
 
• ≥ Grade  3 hematologic  or non-hematologic  toxicity  including  fever.  (Grade  3 fever  is > 
40ºC  for < 24 hours).  
 
• Grade  3 injection  site reaction.  (Grade  3 is defined  as ulceration  or necrosis  that is 
severe  or prolonged,  or requiring  surgery).  
 
11.3 General  
 
The toxicity  profiles  of the different  investigational  agents  are generally  non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Emergence  of novel  toxicities  resulting  from the combination  is not expected,  but patients  will 
be carefully  monitored  for unexpected  events.  
 
 
 
It is expected  that patients  with nausea,  emesis,  diarrhea,  or constipation  will receive  
appropriate  medical  management  without  dose  modification.  However,  patients  with 
persistent  (≥ 24 hours)  Grade  ≥[ADDRESS_640810] on organ  function  of Grade  ≥2 require  delay  
in subsequent  therapy  for a maximum  of 28 days until recovered  to Grade  1, or pre-therapy

11.4 Assessment  of Safety  
 
The Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_498233].  
Safety  Parameters  
 
11.4.1  Definition  of adverse  events  
 
The International  Conference  on Harmonization  (ICH)  Guideline  for Good  Clinical  Practice  
(GCP)  E6(R1)  defines  an AE as: 
Any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a patient  or clinical  investigation  subject  administered  a 
pharmaceutical  product  and which  does not necessarily  have a causal  relationship  with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore  be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an 
abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with the use of a 
medicinal  product,  whether  or not considered  related  to the medicinal  product.  
 
An AE includes  but is not limited  to any clinically  significant  worsening  of a subject ‟s 
pre-existing  condition.  An abnormal  laboratory  finding  (including  ECG  finding)  that requires  
an action  or intervention  by [CONTACT_093],  or a finding  judged  by [CONTACT_362978]  a change  beyond  the range  of normal  physiologic  fluctuation,  should  be reported  
as an AE. 
 
Adverse  events  may be treatment  emergent  (ie, occurring  after initial  receipt  of  
investigational  product)  or nontreatment  emergent.  A nontreatment -emergent  AE is any new 
sign or symptom,  disease,  or other  untoward  medical  event  that begins  after written  informed  
consent  has been  obtained  but before  the subject  has received  investigational  product.  
 
Elective  treatment  or surgery  or preplanned  treatment  or surgery  (that was scheduled  prior to 
the subject  being  enrolled  into the study)  for a documented  pre-existing  condition,  that did  
not worsen  from baseline,  is not considered  an AE (serious  or nonserious).  An untoward  
medical  event  occurring  during  the prescheduled  elective  procedure  or routinely  scheduled  
treatment  should  be recorded  as an AE or SAE.  
 
The term AE is used  to include  both serious  and non-serious  AE‟s. 
 
11.4.2  Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE’s) 
 
A serious  adverse  event  is an AE occurring  during  any study  phase  (i.e., screening,  run-in, 
treatment,  wash -out, follow -up), at any dose  of the study  drugs  that fulfils  one or more  of the 
following  criteria:  
 
• Results  in death  
• Is immediately  life-threatening

• Requires  in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088]  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity  
• Is a congenital  abnormality  or birth defect  in offspring  of the subject  
• Is an important  medical  event  that may jeopardize  the patient  or may require  medical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  above.  
Medical  or scientific  judgment  should  be exercised  in deciding  whether  expedited  reporting  is 
appropriate  in this situation.  Examples  of medically  important  events  are intensive  treatment  
in an emergency  room  or at home  for allergic  bronchospasm,  blood  dyscrasias,  or 
convulsions  that do not result  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602];  or development  of drug dependency  or drug 
abuse.  
 
The causality  of SAE‟s (their  relationship  to all study  treatment/procedures)  will be assessed  
by [CONTACT_093](s)  and communicated  to the FDA and  [COMPANY_008]  in parallel.  
11.4.[ADDRESS_640813] (AESI) is one of scientific  and medical  interest  specific  
to understanding  of the Investigational  Product  and may require  close  monitoring  and rapid  
communication  by [CONTACT_362979]. An AESI  may be serious  or non-serious.  
The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these e vents in order to 
characterize  and understand  them  in association  with the use of this investigational product.  
 
AESIs  for durvalumab  include  but are not limited  to events  with a potential  inflammatory  or immune - 
mediated  mechanism  and which  may require  more  frequent  monitoring  and/or  interventions  such  as 
steroids,  immunosuppressants  and/or  hormone  replacement  therapy.  These  AESIs  are being  closely  
monitored  in clinical  studies  with durvalumab  monotherapy  and combination  therapy.  An immune - 
related  adverse  event  (irAE)  is defined  as an adverse  event  that is associated  with drug exposure  
and is consistent  with an immune -mediated  mechanism  of action  and where  there   is  no  clear  
alternate  etiology.  Serologic,  immunologic,  and histologic  (biopsy)  data,  as appropriate,  should  be 
used  to support  an irAE diagnosis.  Appropriate  efforts  should  be made  to rule out  neoplastic,  
infectious,  metabolic,  toxin,  or other  etiologic  causes  of the irAE. 
If the Investigator  has any questions  in regards  to an adverse  event  (AE) being  an irAE,  the 
Investigator  should  promptly  contact  [CONTACT_33139].  
AESIs  observed  with durvalumab  include:  
• Colitis  
• Pneumonitis  
• ALT/AST  increases  / hepatitis  / hepatotoxicity  
• Neuropathy   /  neuromuscular   toxicity   (i.e.  events   of  encephalitis,   peripheral   motor   and 
sensory  neuropathies,  Guillain -Barré,  and myasthenia  gravis)  
• Endocrinopathy    (i.e.   events  of   hypophysitis,    adrenal  insufficiency,    and   hyper -   and 
hypothyroidism)  
• Dermatitis

• Nephritis  
• Pancreatitis    (or labs suggestive  of pancreatitis   - increased  serum  lipase,  increased  serum  
amylase)  
Further  information  on these  risks (e.g. presenting  symptoms)  can be found  in the current  version  of 
the durvalumab  Investigator  Brochure.  
Pneumonitis  
 
Adverse  events  of pneumonitis  are of interest  for [COMPANY_008]/Medimmune,  as pneumonitis  
has been  reported  with anti-PD-1 MAbs  (Topalian  et al, NEJM  2012).  Initial  work-up should  
include  high-resolution  CT scan,  ruling  out infection,  and pulse  oximetry.  Pulmonary  
consultation  is highly  recommended.  
 
Guidelines  for the management  of subjects  with immune -mediated  events  including  
pneumonitis  are outlined  in Section  6.6.1.  
11.4.[ADDRESS_640815] been  reported  with anti- 
PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 therapy  (Brahmer  et al 2012).  As with the administration  of any foreign  
protein  and/or  other  biologic  agents,  reactions  following  the infusion  of MAbs  can be caused  
by [CONTACT_498277],  including  acute  anaphylactic  (immunoglobulin  E-mediated)  and 
anaphylactoid  reactions  against  the MAb,  and serum  sickness.  Acute  allergic  reactions  may 
occur,  may be severe,  and may result  in death.  Acute  allergic  reactions  may include  
hypotension,  dyspnea,  cyanosis,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_33078],  urticaria,  pruritus,  angioedema,  
hypotonia,  arthralgia,  bronchospasm,  wheeze,  cough,  dizziness,  fatigue,  headache,  
hypertension,  myalgia,  vomiting  and unresponsiveness.  
 
Guidelines  for management  of subjects  with hypersensitivity  (including  anaphylactic  reaction)  
and infusion -related  reactions  are outlined  in Appendix  A. 
11.4.5  Hepatic  function  abnormalities  (hepatotoxicity)  
 
Increased  transaminases  have been  reported  during  treatment  with anti-PD-L1/anti -PD-1 
antibodies  (Brahmer  et al 2012).   Inflammatory  hepatitis  has been  reported  in 3% to 9% of 
subjects  treated  with anti-CTLA -4 monoclonal  antibodies  (e.g.,  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).   The clinical  
manifestations  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -treated  subjects  included  general  weakness,  fatigue,  nausea  
and/or  mild fever  and increased  liver function  tests  such  as AST,  ALT, alkaline  phosphatase,  
and/or  total bilirubin.  
 
Hepatic  function  abnormality  is defined  as any increase  in ALT or AST to greater  than 
3 × ULN and concurrent  increase  in total bilirubin  to be greater  than 2 × ULN.  Concurrent  
findings  are those  that derive  from a single  blood  draw  or from separate  blood  draws  taken  
within  8 days of each  other.  Follow -up investigations  and inquiries  will be initiated  promptly  
by [CONTACT_498278]/or  whether  
there  is objective  evidence  that clearly  supports  causation  by a disease  (e.g.,  cholelithiasis  
and bile duct obstruction  with distended  gallbladder)  or an agent  other  than the 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -011 A(5)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_640816] or ALT ≥3xULN  or total bilirubin  ≥ 2x ULN may need  
to be reported  as SAE‟s, These  cases  should  be reported  as SAEs  if, after evaluation  they 
meet  the criteria  for a Hy‟s Law case  or if any of the individual  liver test parameters  fulfill any 
of the SAE criteria.  
Gastrointestinal  disorders  
Diarrhea/colitis  is the most  commonly  observed  treatment  emergent  SAE when  
tremelimumab  is used  as monotherapy.  In rare cases,  colon  perforation  may occur  that 
requires  surgery  (colectomy)  or can lead to a fatal outcome  if not properly  managed.  
Guidelines  on management  of diarrhea  and colitis  in patients  receiving  durvalumab  are 
provided  in Appendix  A. 
Endocrine  disorders  
Immune -mediated  endocrinopathies  include  hypophysitis,  adrenal  insufficiency,  and hyper - 
and hypothyroidism.  Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with immune -mediated  
endocrine  events  are provided  in Appendix  A. 
Pancreatic  disorders  
Immune -mediated  pancreatitis  includes  autoimmune  pancreatitis,  and lipase  and amylase  
elevation.  Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with immune -mediated  pancreatic  
disorders  are provided  in Appendix  A. 
Neurotoxicity  
Immune -mediated  nervous  system  events  include  encephalitis,  peripheral  motor  and sensory  
neuropathies,  Guillain -Barré,  and myasthenia  gravis.  Guidelines  for the management  of 
patients  with immune -mediated  neurotoxic  events  are provided  in Appendix  A. 
Nephritis  
Consult  with Nephrologist.    Monitor  for signs  and symptoms  that may be related  to changes  
in renal  function  (e.g. routine  urinalysis,  elevated  serum  BUN and creatinine,  decreased  
creatinine  clearance,  electrolyte  imbalance,  decrease  in urine  output,  proteinuria,  etc) 
Patients  should  be thoroughly  evaluated  to rule out any alternative  etiology  (e.g.,  disease  
progression,  infections  etc.) 
Steroids  should  be considered  in the absence  of clear  alternative  etiology  even for low grade  
events  (Grade  2), in order  to prevent  potential  progression  to higher  grade  event.  
Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with immune -mediated  neurotoxic  events  are 
provided  in Appendix  A. 
11.4.6  Criteria  for Hy’s Law (FDA  Guidance  2009)  
 
• The drug causes  hepatocellular  injury,  generally  shown  by a higher  incidence  of 3-fold or 
greater  elevations  above  the ULN of ALT or AST than the (non-hepatotoxic)  control  drug 
or placebo

• Among  trial subjects  showing  such  aminotransferase  elevations,  often  with 
aminotransferases  much  greater  than [ADDRESS_640818],  one or more  also show  elevation  of 
serum  total bilirubin  to >[ADDRESS_640819],  without  initial  findings  of cholestasis  (elevated  serum  
alkaline  phosphatase)  
 
• No other  reason  can be found  to explain  the combination  of increased  aminotransferases 
and total bilirubin,  such as viral hepatitis  A, B, or C; pre-existing  or acute  liver disease;  or 
another  drug capable  of causing  the observed  injury.  
12.1 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
Antitumor  Effect  
 
Response  and progression  will be evaluated  in this study  using  the new international  criteria  
proposed  by [CONTACT_28637]  (RECIST)  guideline  
(version  1.1) [22]. Changes  in the largest  diameter  (unidimensional  measurement)  of the 
tumor  lesions  and the shortest  diameter  in the case  of malignant  lymph  nodes  are used  in 
the RECIST  criteria.  
12.[ADDRESS_640820]  their 
response  classified  according  to the definitions  stated  below.  (Note:  Patients  who exhibit  
objective  disease  progression  prior to the end of cycle  1 will also be considered  evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable  Non-Tar get Disease  Response . Patients  who have lesions  present  at baseline  that 
are evaluable  but do not meet  the definitions  of measurable  disease,  have received  at least 
one cycle  of therapy,  and have  had their disease  reevaluated  will be considered  evaluable   
for non-target  disease.  The response  assessment  is based  on the presence,  absence,  or 
unequivocal  progression  of the lesions.  
12.[ADDRESS_640821] one dimension  (longest  diameter  to be recorded)  as >[ADDRESS_640822]  x- 
ray, as >[ADDRESS_640823] scan,  or >[ADDRESS_640824]  be recorded  in millimeters  (or decimal  fractions  of centimeters).  
 
Note: Tumor  lesions  that are situated  in a previously  irradiated  area will not be considered  
measurable  unless  progression  is documented  or a biopsy  is obtained  to confirm  
persistence  at least [ADDRESS_640825]  be >[ADDRESS_640826] scan (CT scan  slice thickness

recommended  to be no greater  than 5 mm).  At baseline  and in follow -up, only  the short  axis 
will be measured  and followed.  
 
Non-measurable  disease . All other  lesions  (or sites of disease),  including  small  lesions  
(longest  diameter  <10 mm or pathological  lymph  nodes  with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short  axis),  are 
considered  non-measurable  disease.  Bone  lesions,  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  
pleural/pericardial  effusions,  lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonitis,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  and 
abdo minal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable. 
 
Note: Cystic  lesions  that meet  the criteria  for radiographically  defined  simple  cysts  should   
not be considered  as malignant  lesions  (neither  measurable  nor non-measurable)  since  they 
are, by [CONTACT_108],  simple  cysts.  
 
„Cystic  lesions ‟ thought  to represent  cystic  metastases  can be considered  as measurable  
lesions,  if they meet  the definition  of measurability  described  above.  However,  if non-cystic  
lesions  are present  in the same  patient,  these  are preferred  for selection  as target  lesions.  
 
Target  lesions . All measurable  lesions  up to a maximum  of 2 lesions  per organ  and 5 lesions  
in total, representative  of all involved  organs,  should  be identified  as target  lesions  and 
recorded  and measured  at baseline.  Target  lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  of their 
size (lesions  with the longest  diameter),  be representative  of all involved  organs,  but in 
addition  should  be those  that lend themselves  to reproducible  repeated  measurements.   It 
may be the case  that, on occasion,  the largest  lesion  does not lend itself to reproducible  
measurement  in which  circumstance  the next largest  lesion  which  can be measured  
reproducibly  should  be selected.  A sum of the diameters  (longest  for non-nodal  lesions,  short  
axis for nodal  lesions)  for all target  lesions  will be calculated  and reported  as the baseline  
sum diameters.  If lymph  nodes  are to be included  in the sum,  then only the short  axis is 
added  into the sum.  The baseline  sum diameters  will be used  as reference  to  further  
characterize  any objective  tumor  regression  in the measurable  dimension  of the disease.  
 
Non-target  lesions . All other  lesions  (or sites of disease)  including  any measurable  lesions  
over and above  the 5 target  lesions  should  be identified  as non-target  lesions  and should  
also be recorded  at baseline.  Measurements  of these  lesions  are not required,  but the 
presence,  absence,  or in rare cases  unequivocal  progression  of each  should  be noted  
throughout  follow -up. 
 
12.3 Methods  for Evaluation  of Measurable  Disease  
 
All measurements  should  be taken  and recorded  in metric  notation  using  a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline  evaluations  should  be performed  as closely  as possible  to the beginning  of 
treatment  and never  more  than 4 weeks  before  the beginning  of the treatment.  The same  
method  of assessment  and the same  technique  should  be used  to characterize  each  
identified  and reported  lesion  at baseline  and during followup.  Imaging -based  evaluation  is 
preferred  to evaluation  by [CONTACT_105949](s)  being  followed  cannot  be 
imaged  but are assessable  by [CONTACT_40133].  
 
Clinical  lesions : Clinical  lesions  will only be considered  measurable  when  they are 
superficial  (e.g.,  skin nodules  and palpable  lymph  nodes)  and ≥10 mm diameter  as assessed  
using  calipers  (e.g.,  skin nodules).  In the case  of skin lesions,  documentation  by [CONTACT_105950],  including  a ruler to estimate  the size of the lesion,  is recommended.  
 
Chest  x-ray: Lesions  on chest  x-ray are acceptable  as measurable  lesions  when  they are 
clearly  defined  and surrounded  by [CONTACT_28638].  However,  CT is preferable.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -011 A(5)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_640828] and MR I: This guideline  has defined  measurability  of lesions  on CT scan  
based  on the assumption  that CT slice thickness  is [ADDRESS_640829] slice 
thickness  greater  than 5 mm, the minimum  size for a measurable  lesion  should  be twice  the 
slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable  in certain  situations  (e.g. for body  scans),  but NOT 
lung. 
 
CA125 : CA125  alone  cannot  be used  to assess  response.  If CA125  is initially  above  the 
upper  normal  limit, it must  normalize  for a patient  to be considered  in complete  clinical  
response.  
 
12.4 Response  Criteria  
Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
Complete  Response  (CR):  Disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  nodes  
(whether  target  or non-target)  must  have reduction  in short  axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial  Response  (PR):  At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of the diameters  of target  
lesions,  taking  as reference  the baseline  sum diameters.  
 
Progressive  Disease  (PD):  At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the diameters  of target  
lesions,  taking  as reference  the smallest  sum on study  (this includes  the baseline  sum if that 
is the smallest  on study).  In addition  to the relative  increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also 
demonstrate  an absolute  increase  of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance  of one or more  
new lesions  is also considered  progressions).  
 
Stable  Disease  (SD):  Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  increase  to 
qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  sum diameters  while  on study.  
Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR):  Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and normalization  of 
tumor  marker  level.  All lymph  nodes  must  be non-pathological  in size (<10 mm short  axis).  
Note:  If CA125  is initially  above  the upper  normal  limit, it must  normalize  for a patient  to be 
considered  in complete  clinical  response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)  and/or  maintenance  of 
CA125  level above  the normal  limits.  
Progressive  Disease  (PD):  Appearance  of one or more  new lesions  and/or  unequivocal  
progression  of existing  non-target  lesions.  Unequivocal  progression  should  not normally  
trump  target  lesion  status.  It must  be representative  of overall  disease  status  change,  not a 
single  lesion  increase.  
Although  a clear  progression  of “non-target”  lesions  only is exceptional,  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_498234],  and the progression  status  should  
be confirmed  at a later time by [CONTACT_28639]  (or Principal  Investigator).

Duration  of Response  
 
Duration  of overall  response : The duration  of overall  response  is measured  from the time 
measurement  criteria  are met for CR or PR (whichever  is first recorded)  until the first date 
that recurrent  or progressive  disease  is objectively  documented  (taking  as reference  for 
progressive  disease  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the treatment  started).  The 
duration  of overall  CR is measured  from the time measurement  criteria  are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive  disease  is objectively  documented.  
Duration  of stable  disease : Stable  disease  is measured  from the start of the treatment  until 
the criteria  for progression  are met, taking  as reference  the smallest  measurements  
recorded  since  the treatment  started,  including  the baseline  measurements.  
Progression -Free Survival  
 
Progression -Free Survival  (PFS)  is defined  as the duration  of time from start of treatment  to 
time of recurrence,  progression,  or death,  whichever  occurs  first. 
Survival  
 
Survival  is defined  as the duration  of time from start of treatment  to time of death  or the date 
of last contact  
[CONTACT_498279]'s  efficacy  objecti  ves will be evaluated according  to the standard,  
unmodified  REC IST v1.[ADDRESS_640832] criteria  for 
progression  of disease.  
 
The response  to immunotherapy  may differ  from the typi[INVESTIGATOR_498235]  (Wolchok  et al 2009,  Nishino  et al 2013):  
 
• Response  to immunotherapy  may be delayed

• Response  to immunotherapy  may occur  after POD  by [CONTACT_362985]  
• The appearance  of new lesions  may not represent  POD  with immunotherapy  
• SD while  on immunotherapy  may be durable  and represent  clinical  benefit.  
 
 
As long as they are receiving  treatment  on protocol,  patients  will be permitted  to continue  
study  treatment  after RECIST  v 1.1 criteria  for POD  are met if they meet  all of the following  
criteria : 
 
• Absence  of symptoms  and signs  indicating  unequivocal  progression  of disease  
• No decline  in ECOG  performance  status  
• Absence  of tumor  growth  at critical  anatomical  sites (e.g.,  leptomeningeal  disease)  that 
cannot  be managed  by [CONTACT_990] -allowed  medical  interventions  
 
• Patients  for whom  approved  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_498236].  
 
Modification  of RECIST  as described  may discourage  the early discontinuation  of  
durvalumab  + TPIV200  and provide  a more  complete  evaluation  of its anti-tumor  activity  than 
would  be seen  with conventional  response  criteria.   Nonetheless,  the efficacy  analysis  will be 
conducted  by [CONTACT_498280]  v 1.[ADDRESS_640834]  v 1.1. 
 
The primary  reason  for study  treatment  discontinuation  should  be documented  on the eCRF.  
 
Of note,  clinically  significant  deterioration  is considered  to be a rapid  tumor  progression  that 
necessitates  treatment  with anti-cancer  therapy  other  than durvalumab  + TPIV200  or with 
symptomatic  progression  that requires  urgent  medical  intervention  (e.g.,  central  nervous  
system  metastasis,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_362929],  spi[INVESTIGATOR_144101]).  
 
irRECIST  
 
Immune -related  RECIST  (irRECIST)  guidelines  according  to Bohnsack  et al. (48) are 
presented  below.  
 
I. Baseline Assessments in irRECIST 
 
In irRECIST,  baseline  assessment  and measurement  of measurable/non -measurable  and 
target/non -target  lesions  and lymph  nodes  are in line with RECIST  1.1. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -011 A(5)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_640835]  is that the appearance  new lesions  does  not 
automatically  indicate  progression.   Instead,  all measured  lesions  (baseline -selected  
target  lesions  and new measurable  lesions)  are combined  into the total measured  
tumor  burden  (TMTB)  at follow  up.  Baseline -selected  target  lesions  and new 
measurable  lesions  are NOT assessed  separately.  Measurements  of those  lesions  are 
combined  into the TMTB,  and one combined  assessment  provided.  
 
In order  to be selected  as new measurable  lesions  (≤ 2 lesions  per organ,  ≤ 5 lesions  total, 
per time point),  new lesions  must  meet  criteria  as defined  for baseline  target  lesion  selection  
and meet  the same  minimum  size requirements  of [ADDRESS_640836]  1.1 definitions  for assessment  of non-target  lesions  apply.   The response  of non- 
target  lesions  primarily  contributes  to the overall  response  assessments  of irCR and irNon - 
CR/Non -PD (irNN).  Non-target  lesions  do not affect  irPR and irSD assessments.  Only a 
massive  and unequivocal  worsening  of non-target  lesions  alone,  even  without  progress  in the 
TMTB  is indicative  of irPD.  In alignment  with RECIST  1.1, baseline  selected  non-target  
lesions  can never  convert  to measurable  lesions,  not even  if they increase  in size at 
subsequent  time points  and become  measurable.  Only true new lesions  can be measured  
and contribute to the TMTB. 
C. Follow -up for New Non-Measurable  Lesions  
All new lesions  not selected  as new measurable  lesions  are considered  new non-measurable  
lesions  and are followed  qualitatively.  Only a massive  and unequivocal  progression  of new 
non-measurable  lesions  leads  to an overall  assessment  of irPD for the time point.  Persisting  
new non-measurable  lesions  prevent  irCR.  
III Overall  Assessments  for irRECIST  
 
The irRECIST  overall  tumor  assessment  is based  on TMTB  of measured  target  and 
new lesions,  non-target  lesion  assessment  and new non-measurable  lesions . 
At baseline,  the sum of the longest  diameters  (SumD)  of all target  lesions  (up to 2 lesions  per 
organ,  up to total 5 lesions)  is measured.   At each  subsequent  tumor  assessment  (TA),  the 
SumD  of the target  lesions  and of new, measurable  lesions  (up to 2 new lesions  per organ,  
total 5 new lesions)  are added  together  to provide  the total measurable  tumor  burden  (TMTB).  
 
Overall  Asse  ssments  by [CONTACT_362987]  (irCR)  Complete  disappearance  of all measurable  and non-measurable  lesions.  Lymph  
nodes  must  decrease to < 10 mm in short  axis.

Partial  Response  
(irPR)  Decrease  of ≥ 30% in TMTB relative  to baseline,  non-target lesions  are irNN,  
and no unequivocal  progression  of new non-measurable  lesions  
• If new measurable  lesions  appear  in subjects  with no ta rge t le sion s a t 
ba se line, irPD will be assessed.  That irPD time point  will be considered  a 
new baseline,  and all subsequent  time points  will be compared  to i t for 
response  assessment.  irPR is possible  if the TMTB of new measurable  
lesions  decreases  by ≥ 30% compared  to the first irPD documentation 
• irRECIST can be used  in the a djuva  nt se tting , in subjects  with no visible  
disease  on CT/MRI  scans.  The appearance  of new measurable  lesion(s)  
automatically  leads  to an increase  in TMTB by 100%  and leads  to irPD.  
These  subjects  can achieve  a response  i f the TMTB decreases  at follow -up, 
as a sign of delayed  response.  
• Based  on the above,  sponsors  may consider  enrolling  subjects  with no 
measurable  disease  and/or  no visible  disease  in studies  with response  
related  endpoints.  
Stable  Disease  
(irSD)  Failure  to meet  criteria  for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPD 
Progressive  
Disease (irPD)  Minimum  20% increase  and minimum  [ADDRESS_640838] 
irPD assessment.  An irPD confirmation  scan  may be recommended  for subjects  
with a minimal  TMTB  %-increase  over 20% and especially  during  the flare time- 
window  of the first 12 weeks  of treatment,  depending  on the compound  efficacy  
expectations,  to account  for expected  delayed  response.  
• In irRECIST  a substantial  and unequivocal  increase  of non-ta rge t le sion s is 
indicative  of progression.  
• IrPD may be assigned  for a subject  with multiple  ne w non-me a sura ble

12.5.3  Tissue  gene  expression  profiling  and IHC (MSKCC,  Zamarin,  Wolchok  lab) 
 
By [CONTACT_498281],  and immunofluorescence  
microscopy,  archival  tumor  tissue  will be assessed  for tumor  infiltration  with various  immune  cell 
subsets,  including  CD8 cells,  CD4+  effector  cells (FoxP3 -), CD4+  regulatory  T cells (FoxP3+),  and 
myeloid  cells (CD68+).  Tumors  will also be assessed  for the expression  of the known  activating  co- 
stimulatory  receptors  such  as 4-1BB (CD137),  OX40,  GITR,  CD40,  and ICOS,  as well as known  
immune  inhibitory  components  such  as PD-L1, indoleamine  dioxygenase   (IDO),   B7-H3,  B7-H4, 
LAG3,  TIM-3, PD-1, CTLA -4, VISTA,  and BTLA.  The expression  of each  gene  will be treated  as a 
continuous  variable.  For exploratory  biomarker  analyses,  patients  will be dichotomized  on the basis  
of the primary  efficacy  endpoint.  
 
12.5.4  PBMC  immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  (MSKCC: IMF) 
 
By [CONTACT_498282]-parameter  flow cytometry,  we will explore  whether  peripheral  blood  biomarkers  could  
serve  as early predictors  of clinical  benefit  and provide  targets  for further  combinations,  with a 
particular  focus  on targetable  markers  of T cell activation  (ICOS,  CD137,  OX40,  GITR),   and 
inhibition  (LAG3,  TIM3, PD-1, BTLA,  VISTA),  as well as percentages  of peripheral  inhibitory  immune  
subsets  such as MDSCs  and Tregs.  
 
12.5.5  PBMC  gene  expression  analyses  
 
RNA extracted  from PBMCs  collected  at baseline  and on-treatment  will be analyzed  on the 
Nanostring  platform  using  Nanostring  nCounter  PanCancer  Immune  Profiling  Panel,  to define  gene  
signatures  associated  with clinical  benefit.  
 
12.5.6  PBMC  vaccine -specific  immune  responses  (MSKCC:  IMF) 
 
Whole  blood  will be collected  at baseline  and at [ADDRESS_640842]-therapy  initiation.  CD8 and CD4 
cells will be analyzed  for development  of FRa-specific  T cell responses  by [CONTACT_498283].  
 
12.5.7  PBMC  T cell receptor  (TCR)  repertoire  analyses  (MSKCC:  IMF, Zamarin,  Wolchok  lab) 
 
DNA isolated  from PBMC ‟s will be send  for deep  sequencing  of TCR CDR  regions  at Adaptive  
Biotechnologies  to determine  whether  maintenance  or emergence  of  particular   oligoclonal  
populations  of T cells in the periphery  is predictive  of clinical  benefit.  
 
12.5.8  Serologic  assays  (MSKCC,  Fleisher,  Thoren).  
 
Sera collected  at baseline  and at [ADDRESS_640843]-therapy  will be analyzed  for development  of 
serologic  responses  to FRa.  Using  Surface  Plasmon  Resonance,  these  antibodies  will be 
characterized  for titers,  isotype,  and affinity  to FRa,  These  measures  will be correlated  to clinical  
outcomes.  
 
12.5.9  Identify  HLA class  I-binding  peptides  from FRα that are recognized  by [CONTACT_498284].  Assess  which  out of the 5 peptides  correlates  with the number  of 
lymphocytes  prior to and after therapy.

Patients  may be withdrawn  from the study  if they experience  any of the following:  
 
• Disease  progression,  per investigator  assessment  
• Intolerable  toxicity  of study  drugs  
Other  reasons  for patient  discontinuation  may include,  but are not limited  to, the following:  
 
• Change  in patient  eligibility  
• Non-compliance  
• Patient  decision  
• If the patient  becomes  pregnant  
• If treatment  is delayed  for more  than 28 consecutive  days 
The investigator  has the right to discontinue  a patient  from the study  for any medical  
conditio n that the investigator  determines  may jeopardize  the patient ‟s safety  if he or she 
continues  in the study;  for reasons  of noncompliance  (e.g.,  missed  doses,  visits);  or if the 
investigator  determines  it is in the best interest  of the patient.  
 
 
14.1 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This study  aims  to assess  the activity  of durvalumab  + TPIV200  in patients  with recurrent  or 
persistent  ovarian  or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_498237].  
 
Prior monotherapy  studies  of immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  in ovarian  cancer  have  yielded  
overall  response  rates  in the range  of 10-15%,  and may serve  as a basis  for historical  
comparison  of the doublet  tested  here.

and 25% or higher  will be considered  promising  for further  studies.  Forty  patients  provide  
90% power  and Type  I error of 10% using  a Simon  two stage  design.  There  will be an interim  
analysis  after 27 patients  and if 3 or more  responders  (CR+PR)  are observed  out of 27

rate of 35% or higher  as indicative  of promising  activity.  This test of PFS rate will be 
performed  only if the ORR  analysis  is significant,  and thus PFS assessment  is

of the first hypothesis  of ORR.  The hierarchy  in the two hypotheses  for ORR  and PFS 
ensures  the overall  error rate to be smaller  than 10% (Bretz  2009)  
 
Based  on historical  accrual  rates  in similar  populations,  we anticipate  successful  enrollment  
of 3-4 patients  per month  yielding  a total accrual  time of 18 months.  Accrual  will continue  
until 40 (evaluable  patients  are defined  in section  12.1),  unless  the interim  analysis  after 27 
patients  does not support  continuation.  
Efficacy  Variables  
The intent  of this protocol  is to assess  the vaccine -checkpoint  inhibitor  combination  for 
activity  in patients  with recurrent  platinum -resistant  epi[INVESTIGATOR_498238].  There  are 
no treatment  comparisons  involved.  For the purpose  of this study  „platinum  resistance ‟ will 
refer to patients  who have exhibited  progressive  disease  (clinical,  radiologic,  or serologic)  
within  6 months  of completing  a previous  course  of platinum  therapy  (primary,  secondary,  or 
other).  
 
The principal  parameters  employed  to evaluate  the efficacy  of the combination  are: 
• The rate of ORR  and duration  of overall  objective  response  (ORR  = CR + PR). 
• The frequency  and severity  of observed  adverse  effects.  
• Progression -free survival  rate at [ADDRESS_640848] one cycle  of therapy  will be included.

• Disease  Control  Rate (DCR),  defined  as the percentage  of patients  with complete  
response  (CR) + partial  response  (PR) + stable  disease  (SD) ≥12 weeks  from the 
start of treatment  will be reported  and the 90% confidence  interval  will be estimated  
using  exact  binomial  proportions.  This will be done  following  RECIST  criteria.  
• Progression  free survival  (PFS),  defined  as the duration  of time from start of 
treatment  to time of recurrence,  progression,  or death  due to any cause,  whichever  
occurs  first. Patients  will be censored  at last follow  up date.  The Kaplan  Meier  
estimate  of median  PFS will be reported  as well as the PFS rate at 6 months  
• Overall  survival  (OS),  defined  as the duration  of time from start of treatment  until the 
date of death  due to any cause.  Patients  will be censored  at last follow  up date.  The 
Kaplan  Meier  estimate  of median  OS will be reported.  
• Duration  of response  (DOR),  defined  as the time from which  measurement  criteria  are 
met for CR or PR (whichever  status  is recorded  first using  RECIST)  until the first date 
of documented  disease  progression,  will be estimated  using  the Kaplan  Meier  
method.  Patients  without  documented  progression  will be censored  at last follow  up. 
• The rate of response  using  immune  response  criteria  (refer  to irRECIST  description  in 
section  12.3,  which  defines  responders  and non responders)  and the 90% confidence  
interval  will be estimated  using  exact  binomial  proportions.  
• Adverse  events  by [CONTACT_498285]  4 (CTCAE  v4.03)  will be tabulated  in order  to assess  the safety  profile  
and tolerability  therapy  in treated  patients.  
 
Safety Analysis 
 
A stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_498239].  
 
The rates  of irAE, SAE,  therapy  completion  rate, and protocol  completion  will also be 
reported.  
 
Safety  will be measured  by [CONTACT_362990]  3 or 4 treatment -related  clinically  
significant  toxicities  (NCI Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  version  3.0), 
aside  from Grade  3 or 4 hematologic  or laboratory  abnormalities,  unless  they are deemed  
unexpected  or clinically  significant.  We assume  that a 20% rate of clinically  significant  
treatment -related  adverse  event,  such  as persistent  or unexpected  renal  injury  or pulmonary  
toxicity,  or clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormality,  is an unacceptable  toxicity  rate. The 
trial will be terminated  at any point  if at least 7 out of 40 patients  experience  a grade  3/4 
protocol -related  adverse  event  that is unique  to the combination.  Using  this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37595], the 
probability  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_498240]:  
 
True toxicity  rate 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 
Probability  of early  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  10% 40% 71% 90% 98% 
 
Frequencies  of toxicities  will be tabulated.  The grade  3 or 4 treatment -related  non- 
hematologic/non -laboratory  toxicity  will be estimated  at the end of the trial along  with the 
95% confidence  interval.  With 40 patients,  these  rates  can be estimated  within  ±16%.  
 
In addition  to the Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_498241],  a four-week  safety  monitoring  period  will 
begin  once  4-[ADDRESS_640850] 4 weeks,  treatment  of subsequent  enrollees  may

then resume  at the discretion  of the Principle Investigator.  Observance  of 1 or more  
unexpected,  cli nically -significant  SAE that is possibly,  probably,  or definitely  related  
to protocol  therapy  should  prompt  consideration  to amend  or terminate the protocol.  
 
Methods of Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy  measures  such  as Overall  Response  rate (ORR)  and PFS rate at 6 months  and 
median  progression  free survival  (PFS)  will be estimated.  Clinical  Benefit  Rate (CBR)  will be 
defined  as ORR  + Stable  Disease  (SD) rate. 
 
As per the standard  of reference  set by [CONTACT_498286],  if a new agent  has a true response  rate of 10% or less, it would  be 
considered  of little clinical  significance.  Conversely,  if the true response  rate is at least 25%,  
further  investigation  is clearly  indicated.  These  are the reference  ORR  numbers  used to 
assess  novel  agents  in the GOG -[ADDRESS_640852] been  
evaluated.  As a means  of comparison,  and to further  justify this ORR  goal, the clinical  data  
for several  relevant  cytotoxic  and biologic  agents  are tabulated  here.

aThe chemotherapy  dosing  regimens  used  in the AURELIA  trial were  as follows:  
• Paclitaxel  80 mg/m2 IV on days  1, 8, 15, and 22 every  4 weeks  
• Pegylated  liposomal  doxorubicin  40 mg/m2  IV on day 1 every  4 weeks  
• Topotecan 4 mg/m2 IV on days  1, 8, and 15, every  4 weeks  or 1.25 mg/m2 on days  1 to 5 
every  3 weeks  
bAll patients  had germline  deleterious  mutations  in BRCA  1/ 2. 
cAn additional  7/23 patients  (30%)  had a decrease  in CA -125 marker.  
 
Given  the inherent  difficulty  in detecting  meaningful  overall  survival  (OS)  data in patients  who 
will likely  frequently  receive  multiple,  and divergent  downstream  agents  after end of study,  
including  possible  enrollment  in additional  clinical  trials,  PFS is considered  an appropriate  
endpoint  for meaningful  clinical  efficacy.  (Broglio  2009)  This approach  has been  adopted  for 
ovarian  cancer.  (Bast  2007;  Markman  2007)

• For exploratory  biomarker  analyses,  patients  will be dichotomized  on the basis  of clinical  
benefit  (CB) rate (CR+PR+SD)  as the outcome  measure.  All biomarkers  will be treated  as 
continuous  variables  and minimum  p value  approach  will be used  to define  the appropriate  
cutoffs.  For tissue  based  biomarkers,  CBR  will be correlated  to the level of tissue  expression  
of FRa,  PD-L1, or specific  genes/gene  signatures  identified  from transcriptional  profiling.  
Levels  of gene  expression  and their relationship  to CB will be assessed  graphically  in order  
to explore  potential  cutoffs  for expression  that related  to CB. For peripheral  blood  
biomarkers,  changes  in specific  biomarkers  (e.g. change  in ICOS  level expression  on 
lymphocytes)  from baseline  levels  will be assessed  graphically  in order  to explore  potential  
cutoffs  for expression  that related  to CB. 
• Identify  HLA class  I-binding  peptides  from FRα that are recognized  by [CONTACT_498284].  Assess  which  out of the 5 peptides  correlates  with  the number  of 
lymphocytes  prior to and after therapy.  This aim is exploratory  and hypothesis  generating.  
• Determine  whether  the elicitation  of FRα-specific  immune  responses  correlated  with clinical  
efficacy.  Binary  variables  such  as +/- MDSC ‟s, or +/- FR-specific  T Cells  measured  at weeks  
2, 6, and 12 will be assessed  with PFS in a Cox model  taking  into account  the time- 
dependent  nature  of these  biomarkers  obtained  during  treatment.  Depending  on the number  
of events,  the sample  size might  limit definitive  conclusions  and this analysis  is exploratory.  
• Analyze  whether  FRα-specific  antibodies  elicited  by [CONTACT_498287]  ([CONTACT_498291],  Fleischer  laboratory)

16.1 DAT A M ANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A research  study  assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to study.  The responsibilities  of the RSA 
include  project  compliance,  data collection,  extraction  and data entry,  data reporting,  
coordination  of the activities  of the protocol  study  team  and, and of the flow of regulatory  
paperwork.  
 
The data collected  for the study  will be entered  into a secure  database  (CRDB).  All routine  
blood  test results  required  per the protocol  will be captured  in CRDB  in addition  to  baseline  
medical  conditions  and disease  information,  response  assessments,  off-study  
documentation,  and toxicity  grade  and attribution.  Source  documentation  will be available  to 
support  the computerized  patient  record.  
 
MSKCC  will hold the IND and will be responsible  for all safety  monitoring.  All SAEs  will be 
reported  to the MSKCC  IRB. The safety  of the study  will be monitored  by [CONTACT_498288].  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  by [CONTACT_362995] [INVESTIGATOR_498242].  Routine  data quality  reports  will be 
generated  to assess  missing  data and inconsistencies.  
 
Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow  up will be monitored  
periodically  throughout  the study.  Recurrent  lapses  in data collection,  deviations  or violations  
will be discussed  with the study  team  and a corrective  plan will be generated.  Accrual  goals  
and factors  impacting  accrual  goals  will be discussed  at the weekly  New Patient/Protocol  
meetings.  
 
If accrual  proceeds  more  quickly  than anticipated,  it may be slowed  or staggered  at the 
discretion  of the Principal  Investigator,  to account  for safety  concerns  or data management  
resources.  
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
The data and safety  monitoring  plan at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  was 
approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plan addressed  the new 
policies  set forth by [CONTACT_362996]  "Policy  of the National  Cancer   
Institute  for data and safety  monitoring  of clinical  trials"  which  can be found  at 
http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/noticef iles/not98 -084.html.  The DSM  plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  The MSKCC  data and 
safety  monitoring  plan can be found  on the MSKCC  Internet  at 
http://inside2/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans.pdf.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -011 A(5)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_640855]  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff  
education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus  
there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  has set up three  distinct  
monitoring  processes  for our clinical  trials program.  There  are two sub-committees  that have 
the responsibility  of data and safety  monitoring.  These  are joint sub-committees  with dual- 
reporting  responsibilities.  The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  is the sub- 
committee  responsible  for monitoring  all Phase  1, 2, 1/2, pi[INVESTIGATOR_200935]-phase  clinical  trials.  
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB) is the sub-committee  responsible  for 
monitoring  Phase  3 randomized  clinical  trials.  The Therapeutic  Response  Review  Committee  
(TRRC)  is the sub-committee  of Research  Council  responsible  for the independent  
therapeutic  response  review  for participants  in IRB/PB  approved  clinical  trials  where  
therapeutic  efficacy  is a stated  primary  objective,  typi[INVESTIGATOR_362933]  2 and 3 trials.  Formal  
monitoring  of such  studies  is designed  to ensure  that the interests  of the  participants  are 
being  scrutinized  on a regular  basis,  and that the trial is progressing  in a satisfactory  manner.  
 
The DSMC  convenes  once  per quarter  and monitors  the risk participants  are exposed  to, the 
progress  of the study,  the adequacy  of the data storage  and whether  sufficient  data are being  
entered  into the CRDB.  The DSMC  monitors  phase  1, 2, 1/2, pi[INVESTIGATOR_200935]-phase  trials that 
are not being  monitored  by [CONTACT_362997],  and which  meet  the NCI definition  of a 
Clinical  Trial.  This trial will qualify  for monitoring  by [CONTACT_6802]. 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required,  and the monitoring  procedures  will be 
established  at the time of protocol  activation.  A detailed  description  of the data to be 
collected,  process  of data collection  (i.e., data manager  and/or  data management  office),  
database  that will be utilized  for data collection  and storage  (e.g.,  Clinical  Research  
Database  (CRDB),  user-supported  software),  reporting  requirements  of the data to the 
institution  (IRB),  the sponsor  and/or  governing  agency.

17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
 
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is 
required  for 90-days after the participant ‟s last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the 90-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  
treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 „Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events ‟, the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar days of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:  
 
For IND/IDE  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to  
[EMAIL_440] .  All other  reports  should  be sent to [EMAIL_2141] . 
 
For all other  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to  
[EMAIL_440] .  All other  reports  should  be sent to [EMAIL_203] . 
 
The report  should  contain  the following  information:  
Fields  populated  from CRDB:

• The severity  of the AE 
• The intervention  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o A explanation  of how the AE was handled  
o A description  of the subject ‟s condition  
o Indication  if the subject  remains  on the study  
o If an amendment  will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form.  
The PI‟s signature  [CONTACT_28652].  
For IND/IDE  protocols:  
The CRDB  AE report  should  be completed  as above.   If appropriate,  the report  will be 
forwarded  to the FDA by [CONTACT_86497].  
 
Ethical  conduct  of the study  
 
The study  will be performed  in accordance  with ethical  principles  that have  their origin  in the 
Declaration  of Helsinki  and are consistent  with ICH/Good  Clinical  Practice,  and applicable  
regulatory  requirements  Subject  data protection.  
17.3.1  Recording  of adverse  events  and serious  adverse  events  
 
Adverse  events  will be recorded  via Electronic  CRDB  (Clinical  Records  Database)  using  a 
recognized  medical  term or diagnosis  that accurately  reflects  the event.  Adverse  events  will 
be assessed  by [CONTACT_498289],  relationship  to the investigational  product,  
possible  etiologies,  and whether  the event  meets  criteria  of a fatal  SAE/  or S[LOCATION_003]R  and 
therefore  requires  immediate  notification  to the regulatory  authority  (FDA)  and 
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune  Patient  Safety  in parallel  within  5 calendar  days;  All other  non-fatal 
or non-S[LOCATION_003]R  SAE‟s can be sent to the regulatory  agency  and [COMPANY_008]  within  10 days 
on a monthly  basis.  
 
The following  variables  will be collected  for each  AE: 
 
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date (and time when  clinically  relevant)  when  the AE started  and stopped  
• Changes  in NCI CTCAE  grade  and the maximum  CTC grade  attained  
• Whether  the AE is serious  or not

• Investigator  causality  rating  against  durvalumab  (yes or no) 
• Investigator  causality  rating  against  TPIV200  + GM-CSF (yes or no) 
• Action  taken  with regard  to durvalumab  
• Action  taken  with regard  to TPIV200  + GM-CSF 
• Outcome  
 
In addition,  the following  variables  will be collected  for SAEs  as applicable:  
 
• Date AE met criteria  for serious  AE 
• Date Investigator  became  aware  of serious  AE 
• AE is serious  due to 
• Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Date of discharge  
• Probable  cause  of death  
• Date of death  
• Autopsy  performed  
• Description  of AE 
• Causality  assessment  in relation  to Study  procedure(s)  
• Causality  assessment  in relation  to TPIV200  + GM-CSF 
 
Events,  which  are unequivocally due to disease  progression,  should  not be reported  
as an AE during  the study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study  recording  period  and follow -up for adverse  events  and serious  
adverse  events  
 
Adverse  events  and serious  adverse  events  will be recorded  from time of signature  [CONTACT_363004],  throughout  the treatment  period  and including  the follow -up period  ([ADDRESS_640859] dose  of durvalumab  or TPIV200,  whichever  is later).  
 
During  the course  of the study  all AEs and SAEs  should  be proactively  followed  up for each  
subject.  Every  effort  should  be made  to obtain  a resolution  for all events,  even  if the events  
continue  after discontinuation/study  completion.  
 
If a subject  discontinues  from treatment  for reasons  other  than disease  progression,  and 
therefore  continues  to have  tumor  assessments,  drug or procedure -related  SAEs  must  be 
captured  until the patient  is considered  to have confirmed  PD and will have no further  tumor  
assessments.  
 
The investigator  is responsible  for following  all SAEs  until resolution,  until the subject  returns  
to baseline  status,  or until the condition  has stabilized  with the expectation  that it will remain  
chronic,  even if this extends  beyond  study  participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of unresolved  adverse  events  
 
Any AEs that are unresolved  at the subject ‟s last visit in the study  are followed  up by [CONTACT_362999],  but without  further  recording  in the eCRF.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -011 A(5)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_640860] -related  SAEs  will continue  
to be followed  for safety.  
 
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune  retains  the right to request  additional  information  for any subject  
with ongoing  AE(s)/SAE(s)  at the end of the study,  if judged  necessary.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Post  study  events  
 
After the subject  has been  permanently  withdrawn  from the study,  there  is no obligation  for 
the investigator  to actively  report  information  on new AE or SAEs  occurring  in former  study  
subjects  after the 90-day safety  follow -up period  for patients  treated  with durvalumab.  
However,  if an investigator  learns  of any SAEs,  including  death,  at any time after the subject  
has been  permanently  withdrawn  from study,  and he/she  considers  there  is a reasonable  
possibility  that the event  is related  to study  treatment,  the investigator  should  notify  the study  
sponsors:  the TapI[INVESTIGATOR_498243]/MedImmune  Drug  Safety.  
 
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting  of serious  adverse  events  
 
All SAEs  or S[LOCATION_003]Rs  will be reported,  whether  or not considered  causally  related  to the 
investigational  product,  or to the study  procedure(s).  The reporting  period  for SAEs  is the 
period  immediately  following  the time that written  informed  consent  is obtained  through  [ADDRESS_640861] dose  of durvalumab  or until the initiation  of alternative  anticancer  therapy.  
The investigator  is responsible  for informing  the Ethics  Committee  and/or  the Regulatory  
Authority  of the SAE as per local requirements.  
 
* Sponsor  must  also indicate,  either  in the SAE report  or the cover  page,  the causality  of 
events  in relation  to all study  medications  and if the SAE is related  to disease  
progression , as determined  by [CONTACT_62674].  
* Send  SAE report  and accomp anying  cover  page  by [CONTACT_363000]’s   
designated  mailbox  within  24 hours  of notification:  
AE [EMAIL_774]  and to the TapI[INVESTIGATOR_498244]  
[EMAIL_9509] . 
If a non-serious  AE becomes  serious,  this and other  relevant  follow -up information  must  also 
be provided  to [COMPANY_008],  TapI[INVESTIGATOR_448549],  and the FDA.  
Serious  adverse  events  that do not require  expedited  reporting  to the FDA still need  to be 
reported  to [COMPANY_008]  and TapI[INVESTIGATOR_498245].   This information  should  be reported  on a monthly  basis  and under  
no circumstance  less frequently  than quarterly.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other  events  requiring  reporting  
Overdose  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -011 A(5)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_640862]  receiving  a dose  of durvalumab  in excess  of that 
specified  in the Investigato r‟s Brochure,  unless  otherwise  specified  in this protocol.  
 
Any overdose  of a study  subject  with durvalumab,  with or without  associated  AEs/SAEs,  is 
required  to be reported  within  24 hours  of knowledge  of the event  to the sponsor  and 
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune  Patient  Safety  or designee  using  the designated  Safety  e-mailbox  
(see Section  11.[ADDRESS_640863]  information).  If the overdose  results  in an AE, the AE must  also 
be recorded  as an AE (see Section  11.4).  Overdose  does not automatically  make  an AE 
serious,  but if the consequences  of the overdose  are serious,  for example  death  or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  the event  is serious  and must  be recorded  and reported  as an SAE (see 
Section  11.4).  There  is currently  no specific  treatment  in the event  of an overdose  of 
durvalumab.  
 
The investigator  will use clinical  judgment  to treat any overdose.  
 
 
 
 
Hepatic  function  abnormality  
 
Hepatic  function  abnormality  (as defined  in Section  11.4)  in a study  subject,  with or without  
associated  clinical  manifestations,  is required  to be reported  as “hepatic  function  abnormal”  
within  24 hours  of knowledge  of the event  to the sponsor  and [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune  
Patient  Safety  using  the designated  Safety  e-mailbox  (see Section  11.[ADDRESS_640864]  
information),  unless  a definitive  underlying  diagnosis  for the abnormality  (e.g.,  cholelithiasis  
or bile duct obstruction)  that is unrelated  to investigational  product  has been  confirmed.  
 
• If the definitive  underlying  diagnosis  for the abnormality  has been  established  and is 
unrelated  to investigational  product,  the decision  to continue  dosing  of the study  subject  will 
be based  on the clinical  judgment  of the investigator.  
 
• If no definitive  underlying  diagnosis  for the abnormality  is established,  dosing  of the study

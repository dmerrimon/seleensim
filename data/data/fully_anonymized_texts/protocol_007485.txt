5.  INTRODUCTION  
The AcrySof® Panoptix® IOL (Alcon, Fort Worth, [LOCATION_007], [LOCATION_003])  has been previously 
demonstrated to provide good visual outcomes at distance, intermediate and near2 with a 
high satisfaction rate.3 To date, no study has measured  the rate of spectacle independence 
when the AcrySof® Panoptix® IOL  is implanted bilaterally .  
6.  OBJECTIVE(S)  
The objective is to assess the spectacle independence of patients receiving the AcrySof® 
Panoptix® Intraocular lens (IOL) after uneventful cataract surgery.   
7.  SUBJECTS  
7.1. Subject  Population  
Eligible test subjects will be presenting for  cataract surgery who are interested in  a 
reduced dependence on spectacles for near, intermediate and distance vision, and who are 
considered appropriate candidates for multifocal lens implantation.   
 
A total of  [ADDRESS_1128423] meet the inclusion criteria. Prior to enrollment, subjects will 
be provided information on the study and asked to sign a patient information and co nsent 
form to participate. The patient information and consent form will be approved by [CONTACT_263172].  
7.2. Inclusion  Criteria  
Subjects are eligible for the study if they meet the following criteria:  
Note:  Ocular criteria must be met in b oth eyes.  
• Presenting for uncomplicated bilateral cataract surgery and have an interest in 
spectacle independence using a multifocal IOL or multifocal toric IOL option   
• Gender: Males and Females.   
• Age: 40 or older.  
• Willing and able to provide written info rmed consent for participation in the 
study.  
• Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other study procedures.   
• Have good ocular health, with no pathology that compromises visual acuity 
(outside of residual refractive error and cataract)  
• Have regular corneal astigmatism  with a magnitude that can be treated with a 
non-toric IOL or a toric IOL in the approved ranged for the Panoptix lens.  
• Have 20/ 32 (0.2 logMAR) or better  potential acuity in both eyes  
Panoptix Spectacle Freedom and Satisfaction  Protocol  Page 8 of 20 
v 1.0   8/28/[ADDRESS_1128424] should not be enrolled in the study.  
• Irregular astigmatism (e.g. keratoconus)  
• Corneal pathology (e.g. scar, dystrophy, pterygium, moderate -to-severe dry eye)  
• Monocular st atus (e.g. amblyopia)  
• Previous radial keratotomy, corneal refractive surgery or other corneal surgery 
(e.g. corneal transplant, DSAEK, lamellar keratoplasty)  
• Previous anterior or posterior chamber surgery (e.g., vitrectomy, laser iridotomy)  
• Diabetic retino pathy  
• Macular pathology (e.g. ARMD, ERM)  
• History of retinal detachment  
• Subjects who have an acute or chronic disease or illness that would confound the 
results of this investigation ( e.g., immunocompromised, connective tissue disease, 
clinically significan t atopic disease, diabetes, and any other such disease or 
illness), that are known to affect postoperative visual acuity.  
• Participation in (or current participation) any investigational drug or device trial 
within the previous [ADDRESS_1128425] refraction.  
 
The prim ary outcome measure will be the percent of patients who never or rarely wear 
spectacles for distance, intermediate or near vision at 3 months postop , based on 
responses to the PRSIQ questionnaire  (“a little of the time” or “none of the time”) .  
 
Secondary outcome measures are as follows:  
 
Panoptix Spectacle Freedom and Satisfaction  Protocol  Page 9 of 20 
v 1.0   8/28/2019  
 
• Bilateral visual acuity outcomes (uncorrected and best -distance -corrected) at 
distance (4 -6m), intermediate (60 cm),  and near (40 cm) at the 3 -months postop  
• Manifest refraction (residual spherical equivalent refraction and residual 
astigmatism)  
• Subgroup analysis on subjects that hit refractive target within 0.5D SE at 1 month 
and 3 month follow up  
• PRISQ results - Based o n patients response to questionnaire  
8.2. Methods  Used to Minimize Bias  
As a single -arm study there is no expected bias. Patient selection will be based on the 
patient’s interest and the surgeon’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_140279] a suitable candidate for 
multifocal or mult ifocal toric  IOL implantation . 
 
The measurement of visual acuity will be conducted in a systematic fashion to minimize 
bias. Individuals conducting visual acuity measures will be instructed to perform the 
same testing in the same fashion fo r all subjects, with the same level of encouragement to 
subjects. Questionnaire instructions will be provided to all patients in a similar manner.  
 
All data collection will be completed through provided Case Report Forms (CRFs) or 
computer files generated  by [CONTACT_140285]. All site personnel involved in the 
study will be trained in regard to conducting study -specific procedures . 
9.  STUDY PROCEDURE   
9.1. Informed Consent / Subject enrollment  
No subject will be enrolled into the study who does not meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and does not sign the current approved informed consent document. Informed 
consent will be obtained prior to collecting any data for the study. The original signe d 
documents will be maintained by [CONTACT_1694] a permanent part of the subject's 
medical records. A signed copy will be provided to the subject.  
 
All subjects will receive a reduced surgery fee and a $[ADDRESS_1128426] after the study is 
completed.  
9.2. Visits and Examinations   
Subjects will participate in seven study visits, one eye per visit  for bilateral surgery . 
Visits will includ e an uptake visit, two operative visits, and 4 postoperative visits (Visit 
numbers 1 -5 below).  The visit schedule, comp lete with window and associated CRF 
forms, are displayed in Table 9.2-1.  Details of each study visit, including testing to be 
conducted, are provided below.

9.2.1. Preoperative  
 
At the preoperative exam, subjects will be consented, qualified for the study 
(compared with inclusion/exclusion criteria), a nd assigned a study ID/subject 
number.  Subject numbers will be assigned sequentially at each site in the order of 
enrollment. Pre -operative qualification should take place no more than 30 days 
prior to surgery.    
 
A medical history will be taken and exams  will include the tests described below:  
▪ manifest refraction,  
▪ visual acuity,  
 
In addition, all site -specific, routine preoperative measures should be undertaken.   
 
Measurements should be made as described in section 9.3 below.  
 
9.2.2. Op erative ( Surgery ) 
 
All subjects will undergo cataract surgery with implantation of the Panoptix IOL. 
The surgeon’s usual standard of care with regard to treatment and medication will 
be used for all study subjects.  Surgery planning and IOL power calculation will be  
performed using the surgeon’s preferred method, with an initial a -constant 
provided by [CONTACT_66223].  In addition, the ORA intraoperative aberrometer will be used 
to measure the aphakic eye, to confirm/modify the sphere (and cylinder, for toric 
IOLs) power of the  Panoptix IOL. For eyes receiving a toric IOL the ORA 
intraoperative aberrometer will also be used to measure the pseudophakic eye, to 
optimize lens orientation.  
 
Surgical findings will be recorded and any adverse events/serious adverse events 
(AEs/ SAEs) occurring during surgery will be noted at this visit. Any  other 
problems during surgery and comments regarding surgery will be documented.   
Panoptix Spectacle Freedom and Satisfaction  Protocol  Page 11 of 20

will undergo VA testing  in accordance wi th the  specifications below (Section 
9.3).  Adverse events will be monitored.  
 
9.2.4. Postoperative [ADDRESS_1128428] refraction and VA testing  (Section 9.3). Adverse events 
will be monitored.  
 
9.2.5. Postoperative [ADDRESS_1128429] refraction, VA testing  and complete the PRSIQ 
questionnaire  (Section 9.3). Adverse events will be monitored.  
 
9.2.6. Exit Procedures  
In the event of premature exit from the study, all study related examinations 
should be completed where possible. The Exit CRF should be completed, noting 
that the subject did not complete the study and the reason for premature study 
exit.  If no premature  exit from the study occurs, the Exit CRF should be 
completed at the end of Visit 5 ( Postoperative 3 Months ).  
 
9.3. Study Methods and Measurements  
All routine testing and basic eye examinations should be carried out at each study visit.  
Abnormalities sho uld be recorded in the CRF “Comment” section.  Specific study 
examination procedures are outlined below.  
 
 9.3.1. Manifest Refraction  
Perform a manifest refraction with a high contrast logMAR chart under photopic 
lighting conditions (>85 cd/m2).  Document refraction results with sphere, 
cylinder and axis readings.  If uncorrected visual acuity is not improved by 
[CONTACT_263175], use zero for sphere and cylinder and draw a line t hrough the 
blank for the axis.  
 
Note:   Each subject should be manu ally refracted to his/her best correction by [CONTACT_41004], optometrist, or a skilled technician using a phoropter or trial 
lenses.   
 
Panoptix Spectacle Freedom and Satisfaction  Protocol  Page 12 of 20 
v 1.0   8/28/2019  
 
 9.3.2. Visual Acuity (VA)  
To obtain logMAR VA, ask subject s to begin reading the chart at the smallest row 
where al l letters are easily distinguishable.  Have subject s continue to read rows 
with smaller letters and encourage subject s to guess at all letters in a line if at least 
one correct response was given on the previous row.  Request subject s read rows 
until no le tters on a row are read correctly or until all letters on a row are too 
indistinguishable to even be guessed.  
 
While the subject  is reading the chart, record the number of letters on each line 
read incorrectly by [CONTACT_423]. The last line from which the subject  read at least 
one letter correctly is recorded as the baseline logMAR VA.  The actual logMAR 
VA is calculated using the baseline logMAR VA line and the number of letters 
read incorrectly. This VA should be recorded as the best -corrected monocular 
visual acuity at distance.  
 
It is sufficient to record the uncorrected VA at distance only for the [ADDRESS_1128430] logMAR ETDRS chart under 
photopic lighting (>85 cd/m2) at a distance of [ADDRESS_1128431].   
9.4.  Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled exams may be conducted at the discretion of the Investigator with all 
relevant inform ation from the exam recorded in the source documents and on the 
Unscheduled Visit pages within the CRF booklet.

v 1.0   8/28/[ADDRESS_1128432] an exit visit or who come into the office 
to be exited prior to the scheduled final study visit. Subjects  may be discontinued from 
the study at any time if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], their continued participation in 
the study poses a risk to their health. The reasons for discontinuation include:  
a. Adverse event;  
b. Lost to follow -up; 
c. Subject  decision unrelated to an adverse event;  
d. Protocol violation;  
e. Treatment failure;  
f. Other.  
To ensure the safety of all subjects  who discontinue prior to Visit [ADDRESS_1128433]  and, if necessary, advise them of any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or medical 
procedures that might be needed to maintain their health. Any changes in medical health 
and/or use of concomitant medications should also be captured.  
10.  ANALYSIS PLAN  
10.1. Analysis Data Se ts 
All subjects who are enrolled in the study will be evaluated for safety.  Efficacy analyses 
will be performed based on data from those eyes where uncomplicated cataract surgery 
with Panoptix IOL implantation was completed.    
10.2. Statistical Methodolog y 
A summary of the data will be prepared for all measurement time points.  Summaries of 
the changes observed between the [ADDRESS_1128434] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  For 
variables measured on a categorical scale, summaries will provide the number and 
percentage of subjects who provided each score (or change in scores).  Thes e summaries 
will be provided for all eyes completing the study.  
 
10.2.1. Within -treatment Changes  
For variables measured on a continuous scale, the statistical significance of 
within -treatment changes between time points will be investigated using paired t -
tests.  For variables measured on an ordinal categorical scale, the Wilcoxon 
signed -rank test will be employed.  
10.3. General Statistical Considerations  
The statistical analyses will be performed using S tatistica , version 12 or higher.  A ny 
statis tical tests of hypotheses will employ a level of significance of alpha=0.05 . 
Panoptix Spectacle Freedom and Satisfaction  Protocol  Page 14 of 20 
v 1.0   8/28/[ADDRESS_1128435] allowed successful distinctions to be made in the performance of different 
multifocal IOLs , including Panoptix .3,4 It is expected that 30 patients ( 60 eyes) will 
provide sufficient data to characterize the clinical performance of the lens.    
12. CONFIDENTIALITY/PUBLICATION OF THE STUDY  
The existence of this Study is confidential and should not be discussed with persons 
outside of the Study. Results will be su bmitted for publication and presentation at 
national and/or international meetings. A manuscript will be submitted to peer -review 
journals for publication but there is no guarantee of acceptance.  
 
All study data will be collected on appropriate Case Report  Forms (CRFs). No protected 
health information will be included on the forms. CRFs will be retained in the patient’s 
file for a minimum period of [ADDRESS_1128436] access to your study records:  
 
•    Study Doctor  and staff involved with the study  
 
•    Study Monitor or Auditor  
 
•    Sponsor Company or Research Institution  
 
•    Review boards or accrediting agencies  
 
•    Other State or Federal Regulatory Agencies  
 
The de -identified data may be shared with other researchers for future analysis.  
13.  QUALITY  COMPLAINTS AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
All subjects will be monitored for adverse events over the course of the study. A  place to 
record any adverse event is included on each case report form . 
13.1. General Information  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is 
administered . a study treatment regardless of whether or not the eve nt has a causal 
relationship with the  treatment. An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended 
sign (including an  abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the study  treatment, whether or not related to the treatment. In clinical 
studies, an AE can include an  untoward medical occurrence occurring at any time, 
including run -in or washout periods,  even if no study treatment has been administered.  
Panoptix Spectacle Freedom and Satisfaction  Protocol  Page 15 of 20 
v 1.0   8/28/[ADDRESS_1128437] be documented on an Adverse Event Form 
(AEF). A  separate AEF must be filled out for each event. When possible, signs and 
symptoms  indicating a common underlying pathology sh ould be documented as one 
comprehensive  event. For each recorded event, the AE documentation must include the 
onset date, outcome,  resolution date (if event is resolved), intensity (ie, severity), any 
action with study treatment  taken as a result of the ev ent, and an assessment of the 
adverse event’s relationship to the  study treatment.  
Nonserious Adverse Events  
A nonserious AE is defined as any untoward change in a subject's medical health that 
does not  meet serious criteria noted below (eg, is not life -threatening, does not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  does not prolong a current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], is not disabling, etc.). All 
adverse events must be  reported regardless of whether or not they are related to the study 
treatment.  
 
For nonserious adverse events, an A EF containing all available information will be 
collected  on a routine basis and submitted to the Medical Monitor at the close of the 
study.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse experience that meets any of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  
NOTE: Life -threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the  reaction as it occurred, ie, it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have  caused death ha d it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
NOTE: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815099]/or treatment  (usually involving 
an overnight stay)  that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office 
or an out -patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. 
If a complication prolongs  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_417482], the 
event is serious. When in doubt as  to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred, the 
event should be considered serious.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a  
substantial disruption of a person’s a bility to conduct normal life functions.  
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct  normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include 
Panoptix Spectacle Freedom and Satisfaction  Protocol  Page 16 of 20 
v 1.0   8/28/2019  
 
experiences of relatively  minor medical significance such a s uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  influenza, or accidental trauma (eg, 
sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent  everyday life functions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Is an important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not  
result  in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_746094], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the 
subject and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the  definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or  convulsions that do no t result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug  dependency or drug abuse.  
All available information on a serious adverse event(s) and any other associated AE,  
if applicable, must be forwarded to the study coordinator for forwarding to the 
Medical Monitor  immediately (ie, within one  working day of the Investigator’s or 
site’s knowledge of the event) as follows:  
o Additional information for any applicable event is to be reported as soon as it  
becomes available.  
 
In addition to the reporting of s erious adverse events to the study Medical Monitor,  the 
SAE must be  reported to the IRB / IEC according to their requirements.  
 
The investigator must document all adverse device events  (serious and nonserious  but 
related ) and all serious adverse events (related and unrelated) on the Adverse Device 
Effect and Serious Adverse Event Form. Any device quality complaints  will also be 
documented .  
 
• Both the Quality Complaint Form and the Adverse Device Effect and Serious 
Adverse  Event Form must be faxed immediately to the study coordinator 
using the contact [CONTACT_31307]. A dditional relevant information is to be 
reported as soon as it becomes available.

Further, depending upon the nature of the adverse event (serious or nonserious) or quality 
complaint  being reported, the study sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_263170]’s medical records.  The investigator must also report all advers e events and 
quality complaints  according to the  relevant  IRB requirements.  
 
12.3.1 Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Panoptix Spectacle Freedom and Satisfaction  Protocol  Page 17 of 20 
v 1.0   8/28/[ADDRESS_1128438] assess the 
causality as Related or Not Related to the medical devi ce under investigation. An 
assessment of causal ity will also be performed by [CONTACT_263180], as shown below:  
 
Causality  
Related  An adverse event or quality complaint  classified as related may be 
either definitely related  or possibly related where a direct cause 
and effect relationship with the medical device has not been 
demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse 
event or quality complaint  was caused by [CONTACT_140289].  
 
 
Not Related  An advers e event or quality complaint classified as not related may 
either be definitely unrelated or simply unlikely to be related (i.e., 
there are other more likely causes for the adverse event or quality 
complaint ). 
 
Where appropriate, the investigator must asse ss the intensity (severity) of the 
adverse event as mild, moderate, or severe based on medical judgment with 
consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
 
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An adverse event is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily 
tolerate the sign or symptom.  
Moderate  An adverse event is moderate if the sign or symptom results in 
discomfort significant enough to cause interference with the 
subject’s usual activities.  
Severe  An adverse event is severe if the sign or s ymptom is incapacitating 
and results in the subject’s inability to work or engage in their 
usual activities.  
 
The investigator must document any action taken (i.e., medication, intervention, 
or treatment plan) and outcome of the adverse event or quality complaint  when 
applicable.  
13.4. Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Quality Complaints  
The investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedur es 
are maintained after the study.  Any additional data from these follow -up procedures 
must be documen ted and available to the study coordinator  who, with the Medical 
Monitor,  will determine when the data need to be documented on the CRFs.

13.5. Safety A nalyses  
The type, severity, duration and frequency of reported ocular adverse events will be 
tabulated.  Adverse events will also be summarized for events that were considered 
treatment -related.   
14. GCP, ICH and ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), 
including International Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines, and in general, consistent with 
the [ADDRESS_1128439] regulations.  
The investigator will obtain appropriate IRB /ethics committee  approval prior to initiating 
the study.  
 
The study will be registered with  clinicaltrials.gov .

16. CONFIDENTIALITY  
No protected health  information ( PHI), including the patient’s name [CONTACT_18131] , 
will be collected;  to ensure this, n o PHI information is permitted to be entered on any of 
the Case Report Forms (CRFs) . Subjects will only be identified by [CONTACT_815101]. Collected i nformation will only be used for purposes of this 
study and no information will be sold to third parties. The non -PHI information collected 
may be used for future research, though there is currently no plan to do so.  
17. FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE INF ORMATION/STUDY RELATED 
INJURIES  
Every effort to prevent study -related injury will be taken by [CONTACT_140291]. 
In the event a patient is  injured as a direct result of the study while following the Study 
Doctor’s instructions and the study requir ements, the patient will be instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_140292] . The Study Doctor is to treat the injured subject as needed 
for those injuries caused directly by [CONTACT_98139]. In the event of injury or illness 
caused by [CONTACT_140293] a subject’s  participation in this research study, all charges 
for medical care provided to the subject  will be billed to his or her  insurance company. 
The Study Doctor or Sponsor does not offer to cover the medical care costs for injuries or 
illness es that are not caused directly by [CONTACT_67300]. The Sponsor does not offer to 
provide any other compensation, unless specifically agreed to elsewhere in this 
document.  This information will be  provided to each study subject before the start of the 
study in the consent form . 
18. STUDY ENDPOINT CRITERIA  
18.1. Patient Completion of Study  
If a study patient has completed the final visit (Visit 5) of the study, he/she is considered 
to have completed the study.  
 18.2. Patient Discontinuation  
Each study patient may voluntarily discontinue the study at any time they choose.  Study 
patients who cannot complete the study for administrative reasons (e.g., non -compliance, 
failure to meet visit schedule, etc.) will be discontinued from the study.  St udy patients 
discontinued during the enrollment phase (prior to surgery) of the study will be replaced.  
 18.3. Patient Termination  
A study patient will be terminated if the study patient develops any severe adverse event 
that may be related to the study.   A study patient will receive appropriate treatment at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Notification of termination will be clearly documented.  
These study patients are considered to have completed the study and will not be replaced.

2.0  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantat ion  Background  
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) became feasible in the 1960s after 
elucidation of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex.  Since then, the therapy has 
evolved into an effective treatment for many hematologic disorders [1]. O therwise 
incurable malignancies are frequently cured by [CONTACT_162383], with the likelihood of cure 
ranging from 10% to 85%, depending on the disease and the disease status. The treatment 
strategy incorporates very large doses of chemotherapy and often radi ation to eliminate 
cancer cells and to immunosuppress the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_616394].  
Donor cells give rise to hematopoiesis within two to three weeks, rescuing the patient from 
the effects of high dose therapy.  In the ideal situat ion, immune recovery and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] -
specific tolerance occurs over the following [ADDRESS_817180] disease (GvHD).  A realistic estimate of transplant -related mortality in the 
standard HLA -matched sibling settin g is approximately 25%.  The risk of treatment –related 
mortality limits the success and certainly precludes its use in older patients.  Thus, new 
strategies in transplantation are needed.  
 
[ADDRESS_817181] adoptive immunotherapy  
With the  growing understanding that much of the curative potential of allogeneic bone 
marrow or stem cell transplant (SCT) is from an immune anti -tumor effect of donor cells, 
known as graft -versus -leukemia  (GvL) or graft -versus -tumor  (GvT) [2 -5], a new strategy is  
being employed that shifts the emphasis from high -dose chemo -radiotherapy to donor -
derived, immune -mediated anti -tumor therapy.  In this approach, patients receive 
preparative regimens that, while having some anti -tumor activity, are mainly designed to be  
immunosuppressive enough to allow engraftment of donor stem cells and lymphocytes [6 -
11].  Engrafted lymphocytes then mediate a GvL effect; if the GvL effect of the initial 
transplant is not sufficient, then additional lymphocytes may be infused (achievem ent of 
engraftment allows additional lymphocytes to “take” in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_616395]).  The lower intensity of the preparative regimen 
lessens the overall toxicity by [CONTACT_616419] -radio therapy.  In addition, 
less intensive preparative regimens may be associated with less GvHD, as much evidence 
suggests that high -dose therapy contributes to the syndrome of GvHD by [CONTACT_616420], leading to a cytokine milieu which enhances activati on of graft -versus -host (GvH) 
effector cells [12]. Thus, such an approach may allow the safer use of allogeneic 
transplants in standard populations and may allow extension of allogeneic transplantation 
to patients who could not receive standard (myeloablat ive) transplants because of age or 
co-morbidities. This protocol investigates a non -myeloablative transplant approach, using 
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, to allow engraftment of allogeneic cells, which may 
then mediate anti -tumor effects.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_817182] of 
allogeneic bone marrow transplantation [2,3]. Observations in humans have strongly 
suggested the existence of a GvL effect in human allogeneic BMT [4,5]: relapse rates of 
syngeneic BMT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_616396]; allogeneic 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_616397]; and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] T -cell depleted BMT relapse more frequently 
than recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16483] -T-cell depleted BMT. In addition,  GvL has been purposefully 
induced simply by [CONTACT_616421] (e.g., cyclosporine, steroids), which 
presumably allows the expansion of allogeneic donor lymphocytes with anti -tumor 
reactivity; remissions following this immunologic maneuver h ave been reported in AML, 
CML and NHL.  
 
Based on the potential power of the GvL effect and its presumed mediation by [CONTACT_616422] (T cells and/or natural killer [NK] cells), several groups have infused leukocytes 
obtained from the original bone marrow donor into patients with relapsed malignancy after 
3 
 allogeneic BMT [16 -26]. Most patients treated with donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) have 
had chronic myelogenous leukemia; durable complete remissions have been reported in 50 -
70% of these patients. Ongoing  remissions have also been reported in patients with AML, 
ALL, multiple myeloma, NHL and CLL.  
 
DLIs are often associated with GvHD.  In one series, acute and chronic GvHD occurred in 
60% of patients [23]; however, GvHD was closely associated with disease r esponse 
(p<.[ZIP_CODE]). Several observations have suggested that it may be possible to separate GvL 
from GvHD in some cases. Occasional patients receiving typi[INVESTIGATOR_616398] (108 T 
cells/kg) have been observed who had complete responses but did not develop G vHD [22, 
23].  A higher percentage of patients receiving lower doses of donor leukocytes (107 T 
cells/kg) had complete responses but no GvHD [27, 28].  The incidence and severity of 
GvHD (both acute and chronic) also appears to be significantly lower when escalating 
doses of DLI are used, with similar or improved GvL effect [27, 28].  Two groups have 
administered DLI depleted of CD8+ cells and observed GvL without GvHD in the majority 
of patients [29, 30].  
 
Response to DLI in patients with the following dis eases provides definitive evidence for 
GvL in a percentage of patients.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_817183] in CML is 
supported by [CONTACT_616423]:  
 
a. A lower risk of relapse in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_616399] 
(relative risk 0.24 for patients with both acute and chronic GvHD, p= .03) [5].  
b. A trend towards increased risk of relapse in syngeneic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (relative 
risk 2.95, p=.08)  
c. An increased risk of relapse i n recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] T cell depleted allografts (relative risk 
5.14, p= .0001);  
d. Cyclosporine withdrawal -induced remission in CML patients in relapse after 
allogeneic BMT [14];  
e. Complete remission following treatment with DLI in 50 -75% of patients with CML 
in relapse after allogeneic BMT [22, 23].  
 
In addition, there is evidence that supports a graft -vs.-tumor effect in other hematologic 
diseases as noted below:  
 
2.5  Acute Myelogenous Leukemia  and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  
a. A lower risk of relapse in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_616399] 
(relative risk 0.34 for patients with both acute and chronic GvHD, p= .0003) [5];  
b. An increased risk of relapse in syngeneic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (relative risk 2.58, p= 
.008) [5];  
c. Cyclosporine withdrawal -induced re mission in AML (>ALL) patients in relapse 
after allogeneic BMT [5];  
4 
 d. Complete remission to treatment with DLI alone in patients in cytogenetic -only 
relapse after allogeneic BMT (4 of 9 patients in one series) (Collins, RH et al. 
unpublished observations);  
e. Ongoing disease -free survival in 20% of patients in hematologic relapse after 
allogeneic BMT who are treated with combined DLI and chemotherapy (Collins, 
RH et al. manuscript in preparation)  
 
2.6 Multiple Myeloma   
a. A lower risk of relapse in patients treate d with allogeneic as opposed to autologous 
transplantation (an alternative explanation is re -infusion of tumor cells in 
autologous transplants) [26];  
b. Clear -cut complete remissions to DLI in patients in relapse after allogeneic BMT 
[25, 26].  
 
2.7 Non-Hodgki n’s Lymphoma  
a. A lower risk of relapse in patients treated with allogeneic as opposed to autologous 
transplantation.  In two large studies, patients with lymphoma were assigned to 
allogeneic versus autologous transplants based on the availability of a matche d 
sibling donor [31, 32].  Relapse rates were significantly reduced in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_616400];  
b. Withdrawal of immunosuppression -induced remission (associated with GvHD in 
relapsed NHL after allogeneic BMT) [16].  
c. Clear -cut disease response to DLI [16, 23].  Overall, the number of NHL patients 
treated with DLI is low, making an estimate of response rate difficult                           
at this time.  
 
2.8 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
A graft -vs.-tumor effect in MDS is supported by [CONTACT_616424] I in patients 
with relapsed disease after allogeneic BMT (4 of 10 patients; Collins, RH et al. 
unpublished observations). However, more patients need to be treated to allow definitive 
assessment of response to this maneuver.  
   
2.9 Chronic Lymphocytic Leuk emia (CLL)     
a. Relapse rates are significantly reduced in CLL allografts versus autografts [33] 
(again, reinfusion of tumor cells with autografts is an alternative explanation);  
b. Clear -cut tumor responses have been observed in patients with residual or rela psed 
disease treated with DLI [24].  Not enough patients have yet been reported to allow 
estimation of response rate.  
 
2.10 Hodgkin’s Disease  
A graft -versus -tumor effect is supported mainly by [CONTACT_616425][INVESTIGATOR_840] [34]. To date, very few DLIs have 
been reported in Hodgkin’s disease;  1 of 5 patients in a series has responded (Collins et al, 
unpublished data). In addition, Porter et al. have reported two patients with relapsed 
Hodgkin’s d isease after allogeneic BMT who achieved responses, including a complete 
response after DLI [35].  
5 
  
2.11 Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Transplants  
Stem cells for allogeneic transplantation may be obtained from either the bone marrow or 
the bl ood. Peripheral blood stem cells are obtained by [CONTACT_616426] (G -CSF) for several days to mobilize stem 
cells from the marrow to the blood [36].  The more immunologically mature peripheral 
blood stem cells and higher number of T cells in this pheresis collection increases the rate 
and overall success of engraftment relative to bone marrow -derived stem cells, particularly 
with regard to the platelet cell line.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_616401] , peripheral blood 
stem cell transplants do not result in a higher incidence of acute GvHD, though 
retrospective case -control studies do suggest that the incidence of chronic GvHD may be 
higher.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_817184] by [CONTACT_616427], or by [CONTACT_616428]. The non -myeloablative therapy is 
immunosuppressive enough to allow donor cell engraftment [37] [6 -11]. Allogeneic 
peripheral blood stem cells are infused following therapy, and once engrafted these donor 
immune cells may eliminate residual tumor cells via the GVL effect. If the malignancy 
persists, then the GvT effect may be enhanced by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_616402] (DLI).  Attainment of mixed (donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) 
chime rism after engraftment serves as the necessary platform for subsequent DLI.  
 
We will use this non -myeloablative regimen to treat hematologic malignancies. The design 
of the study incorporates some of the following key features:  
 
1. Immunosuppression without m yeloablation: Patients will receive chemotherapy 
sufficient to allow donor lymphohematopoietic engraftment without complete 
marrow ablation.  If the graft is rejected, the patient will reconstitute autologous 
marrow and survive.  We will use a combination of two agents with known 
immunosuppressive activity in BMT: Cyclophosphamide, which produces 
transient pancytopenia, and Fludarabine, which causes less cytopenia but 
equivalent immunosuppression.  
2. PBSC transplant:  An unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cel l collection from 
a G-CSF stimulated HLA -matched  related  donor should improve the chance of 
engraftment because of the high stem cell dose (>5 x 106/kg CD34+ cells) and 
the presence of donor lymphocytes.  Low intensity preparative regimens have a 
low incid ence of severe GvHD.  To further reduce the risk of GvHD, patients 
will receive cyclosporine (CSA) for the first 100 days after the transplant.  
6 
 3. Use of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) for patients with less than full donor 
chimerism and/or residual disease  to optimize post -transplant engraftment and 
anti-tumor effect.  
3.0   STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Collection of Donor Cells   
Collection of donor cells will be performed per the institution’s standard practice.  
The goal of leukapheresis will be > 5 x 106 CD34+cells/k g.  In the unlikely event of 
a suboptimal PBSC collection, the donor will undergo a bone marrow harvest (non -
mobilized) following a delay of at least 3 days.  
 
3.2 Patient Step I - Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Transplant   
(Refer to Section 7.2 for de tails)  
Participants  will receive fludarabine 25mg/m2/d IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to    
-2, followed by [CONTACT_616429] 1g/m2/d IV on days -3 and -2. This will be 
followed by [CONTACT_616430] 48 hours later. The allogeneic HSC graft 
will a im to deliver greater than 3.5  x 106 CD34+ cells/kg of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593], with a 
minimum of  2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593].    
 
3.3 Patient Step II - Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) and Adjustment of  
Immunosuppression (Refer to Sections 7.4 and 7.5 for details)  
Cyclosporine (CSA) and methotrexate (MTX) will be used for GvHD prophylaxis 
with target serum CSA levels of 200 -400 ng/ml.  
Refer to the Treatment Section (Section 7.5) for adjustment and tapering of 
immunosuppression and for Donor Lymphoc yte Infusions.

 7.2 Treatment Schema  
7.2.1 Day –6 through  day -2 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Fludarabine 25 mg/m2 IV daily over 30 minutes. (If serum creatinine 
is 1.6 -2.5 mg/dl, fludarabine is reduced to 20 mg/m2 daily x 5 days)  
7.2.3  Day –3 and day -2  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recommended hydra tion:  One liter of 0.9% NaCl to be infused over 
1-2 hours prior to initiation of Cyclophosphamide, followed by 0.9% 
NaCl infused at 250 ml/hr for [ADDRESS_817194] -Cyclophosphamide.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mesna at 20% of Cyclophosphamide dose (200 mg/ m2) as an IV 
bolus infusion 15 m inutes prior to Cyclophosphamide.  Repeat same 
intravenous dosage four and eight hours following 
Cyclophosphamide.  If oral, use Mesna tablets a t 40% of 
Cyclophosphamide dose  (400mg/m2) 2 hours and 6 hours after 
Cyclophosphamide.  If vomiting occurs within  2 hours of oral Mesna 
intake, repeat dosing is necessary.         
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cyclophosphamide  (cytoxan) 1g/m2 IV over 2 hours.  
 
7.3 GvHD prophylaxis  
7.3.1 Cyclosporine  (CSA) 3 mg/kg per day , in divided doses , will be administered 
IV beginning on day – 4. When feasibl e, oral C SA at 5 mg/kg twice daily 
will be substituted , as tolerated , with dosage adjustments made to maintain 
serum levels in the 200 -400 mg/ml range. CSA levels will be checked on 
day -1 and every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, thereafter.  A taper will 
be started between days +60 -100 as clinically indicated (see below). The 
precise cyclosporine schedule will depend on chimerism status and on the 
presence and severity of acute GvHD encountered (see below).  
7.3.2 Methotrexate  (MTX) will be administered at a dose of 10mg/m2 
intravenously on days +1, +3, and +6.   
7.[ADDRESS_817195]-transplant Intervention  
7.4.1 The disease status  and chimeric status  will be assessed in all patients o n 
days +30, +60, +100, +180, +365  (all visits +/- 15 days ) for  and as 
otherwise clinically indicated .  Post -transplant decisions pertaining to 
withdrawal of immunosuppression and donor lymphocyte infusions 
(DLI)  will be based both on the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_616406]’s overall disease status.   
 Disease:  Analysis of disease status wil l be undertaken using standard 
morphologic, cytogenetic and molecular methods, along with flow 
cytometry, where applicable, to assess marrow/blood for persistent or 
progressive disease.  
 Chimerism:  Donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_616407] -specific VNTR or STR PCR analysis of bone marrow, peripheral 
blood T cells and granulocytes as outlined in Section 5.3.  
7.4.2 Day #30 : No DLI will be undertaken at day +30. Withdrawal of CSA 
immunosuppression will be done in the following situations:  
 Clear disease progression in the absence of significant graft -versus -host 
disease (> grade II), warranting a rapid taper of cyclosporine therapy (over 2 
weeks).  
13 
  Donor T -cell chimerism status of <40%, as this predicts for loss of the graft 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_616408] [38].   Patients with this level of donor chimerism and no 
evidence of disease response or significant GvHD will begin a CSA taper at 
a rate of 25% every 10 days with intended plateau of the taper if day +60 
reassessment demonstrates a >95% level of donor T -cell sta tus. 
 Patients with 40 -94% donor chimerism on day +30 after transplant and 
stable yet persistent disease with <grade II GvHD will begin a slow CSA 
taper (10% per week).  (Patients with >95% chimerism status on day +30 
and no disease progression will continu e to receive CSA until day +60, with 
reassessment at that time.)  
7.4.3 Day #60 : 
 Patients demonstrating >95% donor chimerism at day +60 with a complete 
disease response and < grade II GvHD will begin a CSA taper by 5% every 
week, with the goal to discontinue CSA by [ADDRESS_817196] -transplant, 
unless a change in disease or chimerism status is noted on subsequent 
evaluation.  
 Patients demonstrating 40 -94% donor chimerism at day +60 without 
evidence of progressive disease or significant GvHD will begin a CSA taper 
by 10% per week with discontinuation at day +[ADDRESS_817197] complete donor T -cell 
chimerism at 2 week follow -up (ie., <95% donor chimerism) and no GvHD 
progression will prompt consideration for D LI at 1 x 10e7 cells per kg 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593], depending on disease and immunosuppressive status.  
 Patients demonstrating <40% donor T -cell chimerism status at day +60 
without evidence of disease response or significant GvHD will begin a CSA 
taper of 25% ev ery 10 days.  Subsequent improvement in chimerism status  
by <20%  at 1-2 week follow -up (or ongoing total don or chimerism of < 
40%) or the development of clear disease progression will prompt 
administration of DLI of 1 x 10e7 cells/kg.           
 Patients de monstrating imminent graft rejection and/or clear disease 
progression at day +60 in the absence of > grade II GvHD will undergo 
rapid tapering of CSA over a 2 week period.  Failure to demonstrate a clear 
response at 1 -2 week follow -up (and no GvHD progress ion) will prompt 
immediate D LI of 1 x 10e7 cells/kg with subsequent dose escalation as 
indicated (see DLI dose escalation section below).      
 Patients who have undergone withdrawal of immunosuppression  at the time 
of their day +30  assessment (above) who d emonstrate <20% improvement 
in donor T -cell chimerism status or persistent/progressive disease at day +60 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_616409] 1 x 10e7 cells/kg.  
7.4.4 Day #60 –100:  Patients demonstrating >95% donor chimerism with disease 
progr ession between days +60 and +100 (without grade > II GvHD) will 
have their CSA  tapered (either by 25% every 10 days or 100% over a 2 
week period, depending on the extent of disease and tempo of progression). 
If these patients demonstrate ongoing disease p rogression at 1 -2 week 
follow -up and no evidence of grade > II GvHD, DLI of 1 x 10e7 cells/kg 
will be administered.   
14 
 7.4.5 DLI / Dose Escalation:   All patients not converting to >95% donor 
chimerism upon follow -up assessment after withdrawal of 
immunosuppressio n will be considered for donor lymphocyte infusion. 
Patients undergoing DLI will be considered for up to 3 escalating doses of 
donor T -cells at 1 x 10e7, 5 x 10e7, and 1 x 10e8 CD3+ cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_616410] [ADDRESS_817198] disease, based on 
subsequent monthly or more frequent follow -up.   
Mandatory prerequisites for  DLI will include the following:  
 Minimal persistence of donor T -cell (at least 1-5% donor CD3 c ells) 
chimerism .  Supportive stem cell infusion and/or immune suppression 
may be utilized to supplement DLI, as clinically indicated.      
 Discontinu ation of all  immunosuppressive therapy for at least  2 weeks 
without significant GvHD flare ( ie., not  ≥ Grad e II) 
 Control of significant leukocytosis as indicated (e.g., with hydroxyurea 
and/or leukapheresis) for patients in hematologic relapse prior to DLI.  
Such intervention should be discontinued at least one day prior to 
initiation of DLI.  Patients with rap idly progressive malignancies 
requiring salvage chemotherapy should have this discontinued at least 3 
weeks prior to DLI.  
 Karnofsky score ≥ 50%.  
 
Consideration for post -DLI dose escalation will be required until one or 
more of the following is confirmed:  
 Attainment of complete donor (>95 -100% T -cell) chimerism                  
 Presence of ≥ grade II acute GvHD or clinical extensive chronic GvHD   
 Regression of malignant disease  
 
      Patients with c hronic myelogenou s leukemia (CML) who have been 
managed wit h the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate  (Gleevec; STI -
571) at the time of referral will discontinue this agent prior to transplant.   In the 
setting of persistent or progressive disease on post -transplant evaluation, this 
agent may be reinitiated,  if clinically indicated, either alone or prior to DLI.    
 
7.5 Use of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) following development of aGvHD: 
Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_616411] -back (DLI ) unless GvHD has been successfully 
treated (i.e. off steroids) or tumor progression is documented.  
 
7.6 Acute GvHD following DLI :  See DHMC BMT SOP on the Treatment of Acute 
GvHD.  
 
7.7 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_616412]:  
1. Afebrile with ANC > 0.5 x 109/l and no active, untreated infection.  
2. Patient can perform daily activities at home,  with caregiver assistance.  
15 
 3. Patient able to tolerate oral fluids and medications sufficiently to maintain 
adequate hydration (goal > 2 liters  po/day).  
4. Patient and caregiver’s understanding of outpatient care is adequate.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_817199] -TRANSPLANT COMPLICATIONS  
8.1 The major complications of allogeneic transplantation include CMV reactivation, 
veno -occlusive disease (VOD), acute and chr onic GvHD, disease progression, graft 
failure and opportunistic infection (bacterial/fungal). Patients with these 
complications will be treated according to DHMC Stem Cell Transplant Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs).  
 
8.2 Treatment of Acute and Chronic  GvHD:  
Patients who develop grade >II GvHD will be treated initially with steroids, 
followed by [CONTACT_616432], as clinically indicated.  Unless the 
GvHD has been successfully treated, these patients will not receive additional donor 
lympho cyte infusions.  (See DHMC BMT SOP on the Treatment of Acute and 
Chronic GvHD.)   
 
9.0 POTENTIAL TOXICITIES, HAZARDS AND DISCOMFORTS

10.0 WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
10.1 Withdrawal from the transplant procedure  
Participants may withdraw from the trial prior to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s admission to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_616413]. Thereafter, the nature of the procedure does not permit 
safe withdrawal from the protocol.   
10.2 Withdrawal from experimental protocol  
10.2.1  The participant has the right at any time not to participate in the trial.  All 
participants who sign an informed consent  will be followed, regardless of 
their clinical status unless the participant withdraws consent for using their 
health information for research purposes.  
10.2.2  Although all patients that sign an informed consent will be followed, 
patients will not be treated acc ording to the trial if the following occurs:  
 The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_616414] (donor 
chimerism or  mixed chimerism)  
 Patients with disease relapse after the day +[ADDRESS_817200] 
active grade > II GvHD or who have failed t o respond to a previous 
donor lymphocyte transfusion  
 Patients with disease progression associated with a significant decline in 
performance status, which negates further treatment on the trial (e.g., 
lymphocyte add -back)  
 
11.0 RESPONSE CRITERIA AND EVALUA TION OF RESULTS   
11.1 OBJECTIVE S

 regimen -related toxicity  
 
17 
 12.0 STATISTICS   
 
12.1 Endpoints – The endpoints of this trial include rates of successful engraftment, 
complete donor chimerism, graft -versus -host disease (acu te and chronic), mortality, 
toxicity , and tumor response rate .  The trial will be amended or closed if excessive 
toxicity or mortality is determined.  The specific toxicity stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_616415] :   
o Greater than 33% incidence of severe (Grade III/IV) graft -versus-host 
disease at day +30 among  the firs t 6 patients enrolled in this study.  
o Greater than 33% morta lity at day +[ADDRESS_817201] 6 patients are  
                        analyzed and it has been determ ined that there is no excessive toxicity.  If at any  
                        subsequent time these toxicity criteria are exceeded, accrual to the trial will be  
                        suspended and the DSMB will be notified and asked to make a recommenda tion for  
                        continuing, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_324739].   
12.1.1  Engraftment will be defined as neutrophil recovery to > 0.5 x 109/L for 3 
consecutive days and an untransfused platelet count > 20 x 109/L. 
12.1.[ADDRESS_817202] -transplant days +30, +60, +100, 
+180 and +365  (all visits +/ - 15 days)  and as otherwise clinically indicated, 
according to the method of lineage -specific chimerism analysis described in 
detail in Section 5.3.2.  Complete donor chimerism will be de fined as the 
presence of at least 95% donor DNA in the T -lymphoid (or unfractionated) 
sample analysis.  
12.1.3  Acute and chronic GvHD will be assessed according to the criteria and 
grading scales of the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, as 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_616416].  
12.1.4  Statistical analysis for the primary  endpoints – Straightforward descriptive 
statistical methods will be used to summarize the primary  endpoints.  Rates 
of successful engraftment, complete donor chimerism, graft -versus -host 
disease (acute an d chronic), and toxicity will be computed with 95% 
confidence intervals. Toxicity will be summarized according to type and 
grade.  In addition, rates of any grade [ADDRESS_817203] -limit method, and the survival curve will be graphed .  
12.2 One of the endpoint s of this study is tumor respon se rate as defined in section 12.3 .  
It is expected that a response rate between 40% and 60% would represent a 
successful  outcome and would suggest that further studies be conducted to more 
completely evaluate efficacy of the experimental treatment (i.e., the treatment will 
be accepted for further study).  The target response rate for this trial is 45%, and a 
response rate o f 20% or less would indicate that the experimental treatment should 
not be recommended for further study (i.e., the treatment would be rejected).   
12.[ADDRESS_817204] stage , 10 patients evaluable for response will be accrued . 
If 3 or more patients experience tumor response (complete or partial) in the first 
stage, the study will progress to the second stage; otherwise, the study will be 
18 
 terminated and the treatment  will be rejected.  In the second stage, 12 additional 
patients evaluable for response will be accrued, for a total of 22 patients.  If 8 or 
more patients experience tumor response in the full patient sample, then the 
treatment will be accepted for further  study; otherwise, it will be rejected.  Tumor 
response criteria will vary by [CONTACT_4623], as outlined in Appendix I .  (Note: p atients 
being transplanted with high -risk disease in first or subsequent remission will not be 
evaluable for response by [CONTACT_616435].  In this patient subset, determination of 
treatment efficacy will be based empi[INVESTIGATOR_616417], immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and/or molecular criteria).  
Tumor response rate will be determined as the r atio of number of complete and 
partial responders to the total number of patients evaluable for response.  The 
complete response rate will be determined as the ratio of complete responders to the 
total number of pa tients evaluable for response.  A 95% conf idence interval for the 
response rate will be computed using exact binomial methods.  
12.4 Sample size justification – The sample size is based on Simon’s optimal 2 -stage 
design (Simon R. Optimal two -stage designs for phase II clinical trials. Controlled 
Clinica l Trials 10:1 -10; 1989.). The probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] 0.68 and 0.10 
for true remission rates of 20% and 45%, respectively.  If the true response rate is 
20%, the probability of accepting the treatment for further study is 0.05 (statistical 
signifi cance level).  For a true response rate of 45%, this probability is 0.81 
(statistical power). With 22 patients, the 95% confidence interval for the response 
rate will have a half width not exceeding +/ - 21%.   
 
13.[ADDRESS_817205] chimerism, GvHD and tumor response will be 
analyzed.   
See Section 5.3  (Lineage -specific Chimerism Analysis).

 Appendix II:  Prophylaxis and Treatment o f Infection  
 
 
Antibacterial Prophylaxis:  
 
Ciprofloxacin 750 mg PO BID beginning day 0 until neutrophil recovery  
Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q12h if unable to take ciprofloxacin by [CONTACT_616442], Wednesday, and Friday, from count recovery unti l 6 
months following BMT (longer if ongoin g immunosuppressive therapy and/or chronic GvHD ). 
 
Antifungal Prophylaxis:  
 
Fluconazole 400 mg PO /IV QD beginning day 0 until engraftment  (if day +30 chimerism status 
suboptimal , continue until day +75). Fluconazole will be discontinued if started on IV 
amphotericin.  
 
Antiviral Monitoring and Prophylaxis:  
 
1. CMV antigenemia testing will be undertaken between day +10 and day +100 for 
pre-transplant CMV seropositive patients or patients receiving CMV seropositive 
stem cells at transplant.  If CMV antigenemia is  detected, Ganciclovir will be 
initiated.  
2. HSV positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55060]:  A cyclovir 400 mg PO TID (or 250 mg/m2 IV 
q12h  if unable to take PO)  from first day of preparative  regimen until discharge ; at 
discharge,  change to valacyclovir 500 mg PO QD until day +100.  
3. HSV negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83433]:  no prophylaxis  
 
Immunoglobulin:  
 
Weekly IgG level surveillance starting day +1 until day +100.  When levels fall below 400mg/dL , 
give IVIG 125mg/kg/wk IV.  If IgG is still <400  mg/dL  on subsequent checks, incr ease to IVIG 
250 mg/kg (or 500 mg/kg, if nec essary) to ensure IgG > 400mg/dL  prior to day +[ADDRESS_817217] -
transplant .  After day +[ADDRESS_817218] -transplant, IVIG will only be continued on a monthly basis and in 
the setting of persistent IgG <400mg/dL .  This will not be given beyond day +[ADDRESS_817219] -transplant.   
 
Fever Regimen:  
 
Fever above 38.2 C or sustained fever with two or more readings above 38.0 C. Any temperature 
with clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_616418]:  see DHMC SOP for Antimicrobial Infections and Protocol.

2.  Chronic Graft -vs.-Host Disease (See DHMC SOP for the Diagnosis and Treatment of 
Chronic GvHD).  
l. If patient develops chronic GvHD at any time after BMT, chronic GvHD is graded as 
outlined below.  
m. If the patient dies before day 100 and has not developed chronic GvHD, then the patient is 
considered not evaluable for chronic GvHD.  
•  Limited chronic GvHD  
Either or both  
 Localized skin involvement  
 Hepatic dysfunction due to chronic GvHD  
•   Extensive chronic GvHD  
Either  
 Generalized skin involvement, or  
 Localized skin involvement and/or hepatic dysfunction  
Plus  
 Liver histology s howing chronic aggressive hepatitis, or  
 Involvement of eye (Schirmers test with less than 5mm wetting), or  
 Involvement of minor salivary glands or oral mucosa demonstrated on labial 
biopsy, or  
 Involvement of any other target organ  
 
3.  Pancytopenia  
Occurrence of an absolute neutrophil count less than 500/ l or platelet count less than 20,000/ l at 
any time after DLI, with the pancytopenia not deemed to be due to underlying hematologic disease 
or chemotherapy.

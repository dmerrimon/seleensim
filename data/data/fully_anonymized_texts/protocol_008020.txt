Page 4 of 21 (V.01/21/201 9)  1.0 Objectives  
 
1.1 Study Objectives  
In this study, we will deliver self- sampling HPV tests and FIT  kits, as well as adapted cancer screening 
educ ational materials, by [CONTACT_188111] 11 0 women who are out -of-date for both cervical and colorectal 
cancer screenings,  recruited through federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in rural, segregated 
counties of Pennsylvania . A control group of 110 women, also recruited through FQHCs in rural, 
segregated counties  of Pennsylvania, will be used for comparison; these women will receive standard-
of-care reminders for can cer screening and complete the baseline and follow -up surveys .  
 
The hypothesis is that delivering self -sampling HPV tests and FIT, as well as adapted educational 
materials, to women in rural, segregated areas could help overcome  environment - and person -level 
barriers and thereby [CONTACT_260245], reduce geo graphic cancer disparities, and improve 
public health.  
 
1.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
Differences in overall cervical cancer screening rate and the overall colorectal cancer screening rate at the end of the study between the two arms.   
2.0 Background  
 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps  
In 2018, an estimated 4,100 women in the [LOCATION_002] died from cervical cancer, and 23,240 women 
died from colorectal cancer.1 It is possible to prevent many of these deaths through screening (e.g., with 
the human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] [HPV] test for cervical cancer or fecal immunochemical test [FIT] for 
colorectal cancer).2,3 Women ages 50-65 are eligible for routine screening for both cancers , yet 
screening for both cancers falls below national goals. Mortality and screening patterns for these cancers vary by [CONTACT_260246].  For example, colorectal cancer mortality is 16% higher,
4 and screening is 9% 
lower,5 in rural than in urban areas. Furthermore, urban/rural differences in screening may be greatest 
in areas that are also racially segregated,6 i.e., areas with high spatial concentrations of a given racial 
group.  
 Women in areas that are both rural and segregated face unique barriers to screening for cervical and colorectal cancers. Social Cognitive Theory
7 posits that environment- , person -, and behavior -level 
factors influence health. Interventions that target determinants at only one level fail to adequately address screening barriers and to account for geographic differences in behaviors.   
 
2.2 Previous Data  
The principal investigator (PI) has conducted several studies on ge ographic disparities in cancer 
prevention and control relevant to this proposal. Most broadly, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_260235] a research study 
demonstrating that, while cancer incidence is only 3% higher in rural compared to metropolitan areas,  
cancer mortality is 10% higher
4; this mortality disparity increases to 13% for cervical cancer and 16% for 
colorectal cancer. Another study focused on cervical cancer described a clustering of risks for women in 
rural areas, including lower density of primary care providers, lower participation in Pap screening, and higher cervical cancer incidence.
8 Further, the authors demonstrated that eliminating urban/rural 
differences in access to and utilization of screening would completely eliminate the disparity in incidence.  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_260236] (e.g., socioeconomic status, racial residential segregation). T he PI [INVESTIGATOR_260237] 5 of 21 (V.01/21/201 9)  a forthcoming study describing urban/rural differences in cervical and colorectal cancer screening, which 
were greatest in counties that were highly racially segregated (Moss & Landrine, in prep).  In addition, an 
upcoming study describes geographic patterns in “complete” participation i n cancer screening, i.e., 
receiving all of the recommended screenings for a given gender and age group (Moss & Cronin, in prep).  
The finding most relevant to this proposal is that more than 50% of women ages [ADDRESS_316602] in areas that were both rural and segregated (although colorectal cancer screening was lower in rural areas, the interaction between rurality and segregation did not reach statistical significance)
9. 
 Most recently, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_260238], including surveys, in -depth interviews, and focus groups. These studies aimed to identify factors that 
affect cancer screening within rural, segregated counties of Pennsylvania. These studies are in the final 
phases of data collection and analysis. Preliminary results show that the t arget study population is 
receptive to using home cancer screening kits  for both cervical and colorectal cancer (>90% willing to 
use a self-sampling test) . Person - and environment -level barriers to care have been identified. Finally, 
data collected during the focus groups were  used to tailor the educational materials that will be utilized 
in the proposed study.  
 
Taken together, these preliminary studies emphasize the urgent need  for interventions to improve 
cervical and colorectal cancer screening behaviors in these communities. Individual -level barriers (e.g., 
attitudes) and environment- level barriers (e.g., access to care) both play an important role in explaining 
the associations of screening with rurality and racial residential segregation.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_316603] is to improve cancer screening in vulnerable communities, specifically women living in rural, segregated areas of Pennsylvania through the use of home cancer screening kits for cervical and colorectal cancer. This will be achieved through the use of adapted educational materials while addressing environment - and person -level barriers to screening. 
 For the purposes of this study, target areas are those designated as “rural” by [CONTACT_260247] a dissimilarity index of racial residential segregation greater than the national mean.  These counties in Pennsylvania include  Clarion, Clearfield, Crawford, Forest, Greene, 
Huntingdon, Indiana,  Lawrence, McKean, Northumberland, Schuylkill,  Somerset, Union,  and Wayne.

Information is included in the “Confidentiality, Privacy and Data 
Management” section of this protocol.  
 
Page 11 of 21 (V.01/21/2019)  [IP_ADDRESS]  Plan to destroy identifiers or a justification for retaining identifiers  
Identifying information  will be destroyed after the completion of data 
analysis.  
 
6.2.2 Explanation for why  the research could not practicably be conducted without access to and 
use of PHI  
 
PHI is necessary for processing the self- sampling tests. Participant date of birth is required when 
completing the Pathology Services Special Account Requisition form. Thus, the research question regarding completion of self- sampling tests cannot be answered without use of PHI. 
Additionally, participant address and email address is necessary for mailing study materials and compensation.  
 
6.2.3 Explanation for w hy the research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver  or 
alteration of authorization  
 Alteration of authorization is necessary since participants will be giving hipaa authorization via 
verbal consent, over the phone prior to data collection. All data collection for the proposed study will be conducted over the phone ; written consent is not feasible since none of the study 
activities will not be in person.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_316608] with the ‘Minimum Necessary’ standard (information reasonably necessary to accomplish the objec tives of the research) per 
federal regulations.   Access to the information will be limited, to the greatest extent possible, within the research team. All disclosures or releases of identifiable information granted under this waiver will be accounted for and documented. 
 
7.0 Study Design and Procedures  
  
7.1 Study Design  
The study is a prospective, two -arm, randomized intervention. Participants will be randomized to 
receive either (1) a standardized letter informing them that they are out-of -date for both cervical and 
colorectal cancer screenings and should schedule an appointment with their provider to receive these screenings , i.e., standard of care  (control arm), or (2) cervical and colorectal cancer self- sampling kits, 
instructions for completing the self- sampl ing kits, and educational materials about cervical and 
colorectal cancer (intervention arm). Participants in the intervention arm will mail their completed self-sampling kits to the Penn State Health Clinical Labs for processing; FIT kits will then be sent to and 
processed by [CONTACT_260249].  All participants will complete a baseline and follow -up survey.  
 
7.2 Study P rocedures  
 
Page 12 of 21 (V.01/21/2019)  7.2.1 Baseline survey - Week 0  
 
Once a participant has been identified, recruited, and consented as described above, she will complete the baseline survey with a member of the study team via phone. After completion of 
the baseline survey, the participant will receive a thank you letter f rom the study team . 
 
7.2.2 Randomization- Week 0  
 
Once a participant has completed the baseline survey, she will be randomly assigned to either 
the control arm or the intervention arm by a member of the study team. A simple 
randomization scheme, with 1:[ADDRESS_316609] kits is quite flexible, since studies show that these samples are stable for up to 28 days.   
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reminder postcard- Week [ADDRESS_316610] not completed and returned both their cervical and colorectal 
cancer self- sampling kits within 6 weeks of receipt of kits will be mailed a reminder 
letter  from the study team.  
 
7.2.5 Follow -up survey - Week 10 
 
Participants will complete the follow -up survey with a member of the study team via phone. 
This will occur regardless of whether the participant was in the intervention or the control arm, and regardless of whether the participant completed and returned the self -sampling kits if in the 
intervention arm.  
 
 
7.3 Duration of Participation  
 Participants will be considered enrolled in the study from the time of consent until the completion of the follow -up survey. We anticipate a total participation of approximately 1 hour and 35 minutes  for 
thos e in the intervention arm  over the course of 10 weeks; this includes  ~45 minutes to complete the 
baseline survey , ~20 minutes for the  follow -up survey  and up to ~15 minutes to complete each cervical 
Page 13 of 21 (V.01/21/2019)  and colorectal cancer screening test kits. We anticipate a total participation of approximately 1 hour and 
5 minutes  for those in the control arm, over the course of 10 weeks; this includes ~45 minutes  to 
complete the baseline survey and ~[ADDRESS_316611] Article(s) (Study Drug(s) and/or Study Device(s))

about 10% loss to follow -up over the study period.  
 
8.2 Sample size determination  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_260241]. 
Should the intervention yield a screening rate of 40% and the control arm a screening rate of 20%, then 
the proposed sample sizes yield 80% power based on a two -sided Fisher’s exact test and a 2.5% type -1 
error rate (allowing for two co -primary endpoints). The re sults of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_260242], more accurately powered studies can be conducted.

The statistical analysis of study outcomes will primarily be descriptive . Outcomes will be assessed via the 
baseline and follow -up surveys, and whether or not self -sampling kits were returned by [CONTACT_260255]. The main outcome is the differences in overall cervical cancer screening rate and the overall c olorectal cancer screening rate at the end of the study between the two arms. Analysis of 
the main outcomes will be evaluated with a Fisher’s exact test.  Demographics of the patients in the two groups will be compared.

mailed to those in the intervention group  will include recommended follow -up steps for women  who receive 
abnormal results, specifically, seeking additional screening or diagnostic tests. These mat erials  will encourage 
participants to reach out to their medical provider at the  FQHCs for these tests (or for referral to  specialists). Test 
results will be mailed to both the study team and the participating FQHC to ensure proper follow -up. These  
procedu res should minimize the time it takes for participants to seek follow -up for abnormal screening results,  
therefore lowering the potential risks from an abnormal screening result. Should any participants be diagnosed  
with cervical or colorectal cancer, potential treatments for individuals with screen -detected versus symptomatic  
cancers are theoretically less risky.  
 Loss of confidentiality is a risk of participation. Disclosure of responses to survey items will not place participants at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to their finances, employability, or reputation.  
 Protection against risks . 
To protect against psychological risks associated with cancer screening, we will include information in the 
educational materials about (1) what scre ening tests examine, (2) what potential  abnormal results could indicate, 
and (3) recommendations for follow -up after abnormal results . 
 In order to protect participant privacy (including survey responses and results of cancer screening tests), data will 
be maintained on a password- protected database on a secure network. A password -protected dataset containing 
participant identifying information will also be maintained  on the secure network, but only the study team  will 
have access to this dataset; this data set will be destroyed after the study is complete.

11.2 Potential Benefits to Others  
The findings of this study can provide benefits to others in that they will inform  future interventions, 
public health programs, and clinical practice to promote screening, earlier diagnosis, and  increased 
survival of cervical and colorectal cancer, especially in vulnerable communities. In addition, the  
proposed research  will benefit participants and others by [CONTACT_260256].  This knowledge  has implications for improving clinical 
and public health generally, as well as specifically increasing  cancer  screening and, in the long-term, 
reducing disparities in, and the overall burden of, cervical and colorectal cancers.  
Page 17 of 21 (V.01/21/2019)  12.0 Sharing Results with Subjects  
Study findings will not be directly shared with participants  by [CONTACT_3476] . However, participants will be notified of 
their self- sampling results by [CONTACT_260257] . Research study team members will receive the results 
of the self-sampling kit from the lab and communicate these results to a central administrat ive employee at the FQHC  
via Penn State Kiteworks. This individual  will share the results with the participants’ medical provider at the FQHC . The 
medical provider will then share these results with the participants via the standard of care as determined b y the 
provider.  PHN’s policy regarding sharing test results with patients is as follows:  
 Once the results are received, the ordering providers must personally acknowledge receipt of  the results with a 
signature [CONTACT_260263].  
 
a. Depending on the type of the test result, the ordering providers may communicate  results to the patients or may  
request that a clinical staff member contact [CONTACT_260258] -up instructions. All patient  
communication is to be  documented in the EMR.  
b. When the patient must take action in response to the results, direct verbal  communication should be used.  
Documentation should reflect that the information was  received and understood by [CONTACT_102]. If the patient cannot be  
reached, reasonable  attempts should be made, this includes using phone outreach and mailed letter  attempts. All 
attempts should be documented in the medical record.  
 
For abnormal results:  
1. An attempt to communicate results to the patient must be initiated  within [ADDRESS_316621] ‘test  result’ letter found in our EMR, indicating 
the need for the patient to contact  [CONTACT_260259].  
 
13.[ADDRESS_316622] Payment and/or Travel Reimbursements  
The study team has received an exception from using Greenphire ClinCards from the Controller. Physical or 
electronic retailer gift cards to reimburse participants will be purchased through Shop OnLion.  
 
Subjects will receive a total of $[ADDRESS_316623] s for their participation. A $[ADDRESS_316624] will be 
provided upon completion of the  baseline survey and a $[ADDRESS_316625] is requested by [CONTACT_2299].

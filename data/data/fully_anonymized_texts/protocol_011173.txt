Study Design: A prospective, multi -center, single arm case series
Study Type: Observational, non-interventional ,  post -market clinica l follow -up 
(PMCF) study 
Study Product: ENTACT ™Septal Staple r
Reference # Description Contains
601-[ZIP_CODE] * ENTACT SEPTAL STAPLER, 
3-PACK [ADDRESS_140667]
Staplers
* The ENTACT (Next Generation) Septal Stapler will launch with the same reference # number
as the previous generation . Previous generation products already at customer sites will remain 
for consumption at launch in the US but are not part of the study . 
Septoplasty- The ENTACT Septal Stapler delivers implantable septal 
staples which are intended to connect internal tissues to aid healing and for approximation of soft tissue during nasal septal surgery.
Study Purpose: To provide evidence to satisfy the Post-Market Clinical Follow -up 
(PMCF ) requirements of CE Marking to market this device in Europe 
(data may be used to support registrations in other countries as well).
Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate clinical success 
of the ENTACT (Next Generation) resorbable septal staple system by 
[CONTACT_125176]’s nasal cavity at the [ADDRESS_140668]™ (Next Generation)

Secondary Objective(s):  The secondary objectives are to  generate performance and health 
economics  data to support  the use of ENTACT  (Next Generation ) 
resorbable septal staple . 
Safety Objective(s):  Assess safety w ith reported complications, adverse events, adverse 
device effects, unanticipated serious adverse device effects, and 
device deficiencies.  
Sample Size:  40 subjects  
The results of a previous clinical study on previous  generation s of the 
study device found  that 92% of subjects had successful fixation of 
tissue after one week. It is assumed that the study device will perform 
at least as well as the 92% found previously. Therefore based on 
statistical precision, the recruitment of [ADDRESS_140669] 80% probability of obtaining a 2 -sided 95% confidence 
interval, around the estimate proportion of successful fixations of 
tissue, to within ±11% precision.  
With the same assumption of clinical success rate and same 
precision target, enrolling [ADDRESS_140670], Next Generation  
will provide probabilities between 78.4% and 90.3% of obtaining the 
2-sided 95% confidence interval of the success rate.  To allow for a 
10% drop out rate, this study will enrol l 40 subjects.  
Number of Study Sites:  Up to 3 sites   
Targeted Global 
Regions:  [LOCATION_002] (US)

deviated septum can cause nasal obstruction and is commonly treated using septoplasty.1-4
Nasal valve dysfunction may be associated with up to 13% of cases of nasal obstruction and is 
also involved in up to 95% of cases of persistent nasal obstruction after septoplasty.1
Repairing a deviated septum can be done through a surgery called septoplasty. During surgery, the deviated cartilage and bone are removed from the septum, leaving a dead space. Septoplasty involves elevation of subperichondrial/periosteal flaps bilaterally as well as resection and/or reshapi[INVESTIGATOR_125146]/or bone.
5The space created between the flaps 
during this procedure must be coapted in order to prevent septal hematoma and other complications such as abscess formation, septal perforation, or saddle-nose deformity, and 
separation of blood supply from the cartilage.

LITERATURE SUMMARY
This section aims to provide a “state of the art” review for the indications in which ENTACT (Next 
Generation) resorbable septal staple system is intended to be used per Section 4.4 . A literature 
search was conducted to identify recently published articles on septoplasty.
Limitations such as language or article type were imposed in some searches for publications. 
Limiting searches to systematic reviews , ameta -analysis was performed to obtain integrated 
findings from several selected studies considered to be supportive of evidence-based practices. The results of these studies are discussed in terms of their general conclusions.
This section aims to identify clinical studies or usage of the current Smith & Nephew ENTACT 
Septal Stapler through an extensive literature search. 
In the current evaluation, the PubMed online database (MedLine component) and Embase were 
used to find clinical results. The medical literature was searched for an unrestricted period of

ENTACT Septal Stapler (Previous generations)
The ENTACT stapler originally launched in 2009 by [CONTACT_125181] (now S+N). Feedback from the market was collected, and changes to the device 
were implemented in [ADDRESS_140716] Septal Stapler ( Next Generation)
The Next Generation device seeking CE marking utilizes the same implant as the current 
version of ENTACT Septal Stapler. The implant’s material composition, geometry, and 
processing remain unchanged. The delivery system is very similar in the new device, with a few changes to the delivery part of the device in order to enhance manufacturability and reduce the 
cost of goods. A comparison of the current vs. new design ENTACT Septal Stapler can be found 
in Table 6.1.3-1.

The Next Generation  Smith+ Nephew ENTACT Septal Stapler described in Table 6.1.[ADDRESS_140721] Septal Stapler 
for the following reasons:  
 Clinical  
o Both devices are indicate d for connecting internal tissues to aid healing and 
for approximation of soft tissues during nasal septal  surgery.  
 Technical  
o Both devices enable septal flap closure through the delivery of resorbable  
implants.  
o The mechanism  and kinematics  used  to deploy  the staples  are the same  in 
both devices. The principles of operation are  identical.  
 Biological:  
o The materials utilized in the implant, implant channel, holding block, and the 
push and pull ribbon are exactly the same in both  devices.  
Below are the identifi ed differences between the Next and Previous Generation ENTACT 
Septal Stapler with a rationale for acceptance of those  differences.  
 Clinical:  
o None, both devices have the same intended  use. 
 Technical:  
o Distal head changes - the height of the distal head was 
reduced from 8.3mm to 7.0mm , and the width  was reduced  
from 6.0mm  to 4.9mm.  The minor  design  changes  to 
improve surgical access do not affect the intended use of 
the device.

Do NOT place a staple where the needle path is obstructed or a collision with any object may occur.
Do NOT use the staple on tissue which is too thick or hard (such as bone) to permit an 
effective tissue capture.
Do NOT use with patients in whom radiopacity is necessary or desired since ENTACT 
staples are radiotransparent.
Do NOT use in patients in whom prolonged tissue approximation beyond that needed for 
normal tissue closure is necessary or desired.
Material Specification Staple Implant
The staple implant configuration is composed of the absorbable copolymer 5% Poly-L-lactide / 95% Polyglycolide. During the molding process, a violet colorant is introduced. The D&C Violet 
#2 is a colorant additive (~ 0.05 wt%) to make the implants easier for the doctor to visualize 
upon placement in the tissue. As previously stated, the ENTACT staple used in both the current 
and subject devices are identical.

STUDY ENDPOINTS
Primary Endpoint
At the 21 -day follow- up visit , the clinician will examine the patient’s nasal cavity and will confirm:
Septum wall straight appearance (yes/no);
Complete coaptation of perichondrial flaps on septum wall (yes/no);
Absence of significant local tissue reaction at the staple site (yes/no);
Absence of hematoma swelling at the staple site (yes/no);
No need for re-intervention at the surgery site (yes/no);
If all the answers to the questions above are “YES” then clinical success will be inferred (if any 
answer is “NO” then repair failure will be inferred). 
Secondary Endpoints 
At the 5, and 42 -day follow -up visi t, the clinician will examine the patient’s nasal cavity 
and will confirm:
oSeptum wall straight appearance (yes/no);
oComplete coaptation of perichondrial flaps on septum wall (yes/no);

Exploratory Endpoints
Exploratory endpoints proposed, but not limited to, the following:
Number and type of other S+N devices with the turbinate reduction adjunct procedure 
Balanced Covariates
The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be generalizable and applicable to the widest possible subset 
of the population needing septoplasty. These criteria will be uniformly applied so as to enroll a cohort of subjects with similar symptoms and clinical requirements. This should maximize t he 
applicability to as many subjects with similar baseline characteristics and help to bolster external validity.
Subject Attrition
Subject attrition due to reduction in sample size required for precision analysis has been accounted for in the sample size calculation so that the estimate of the Confidence Interval (CI) to be obtained will still be valid through the most efficient use of available subjects.
Pre-specification of Statistical Analysis 
The primary outcome measure has been pre-specified as well as the type of statistical analysis to be performed to evaluate procedure success rate so as to minimize reporting bias. The 
precision analysis planned for the study, which includes construction of confidence intervals for the outcome summaries and a pre-defined range in which the 95% CI for the primary outcome are expected to fall within are designed to maximize the validity of the study results.
More detailed information on analyses to be carried out will be incorporated in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) so as minimize any threats to external validity in order to yield clinically 
relevant estimates of effects and precision.

STUDY METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS
Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale
The Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE)16,21scale is a patient reported outcome 
(PRO ) instrument that willbe admin istered to capture subject perception of the degree of nasal 
airway patency. The Nose Scale will be completed at Screening, Day 5, Day 21 and Day 42.
The NOSE scale is a validated instrument, which was developed by [CONTACT_125191]—Head and Neck Surgery (AAO- HNS)16,21, and has been used in several clinical 
trials. The scale is brief, easy to complete, and is an important tool for pre- and post-intervention evaluation of symptoms in subjects with nasal obstruction. The NOSE Scale
21allows subjects to 
quantify their symptoms based on the severity of obstruction.
Subjects will be asked, “Since your last follow up visit, how much of a problem were the following 
conditions for you?” Specifically, subjects will be asked to rate their perceptions on the Likert scale with respect to the following characteristics:
oNasal congestion or stuffiness
oNasal blockage or obstruction

(1) Very Mild Problem(2) Moderate Problem(3) Fairly Bad Problem(4) Severe Problem
Visual Analog Scale
A Visual Analog Scale ( VAS)18is a patient-reported outcome instrument that will be used to 
capture subjects’ degree of pain and in the area where ENTACT resorbable staples were implanted. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain is a continuous scale completed by [CONTACT_125192] a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by [CONTACT_23808] (mm) on the 10-cm line between the “no pain” anchor and the subject's mark, providing a range of scores from 0 –100. For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by “no pain” (score of 0) 
and “pain as bad as it could be” or “worst imaginable pain” (score of 100 [100-mm scale]). The 
VASwill be completed at Screening, Day 5, Day 21, and Day 42.
STATISTICAL DESIGN

GENERAL
Smith+ Nephew ’s Global Biostatistics group or designee will conduct the statistical analysis for 
this study. Unless otherwise stated, all significance tests will be two-sided, performed at the 5% 
significance level. Resulting p-values will be quoted. Point estimates and their corresponding 
95% two-sided confidence intervals will be generated where appropriate. Where data summaries 
are specified, categorical and ordinal variables will be summarized with frequencies and 
percentages. Continuous variables will be summarized with the following summary statistics: number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. All 
analyses will be performed in SAS 9.4 (or later).
ANALYSIS POPULATIONS
The following analysis populations will be used for this study:
Safety population (SAF) : This includes all patients who have received the study 
device.
Full Analysis Set (FAS): This includes all patients who were recruited into the study 
and have at least one post-baseline visit.
Per-Protocol (PP) population: This includes all subjects in the FAS who have no 
signific ant protocol deviations and who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Statistical analysis will be performed using each of the patient populations as follows: Analysis of 
the primary and secondary endpoints will be performed separately using both the FAS and PP 
populations. All safety analyses will utilize the SAF population.

BASELINE DATA
Data to be summarized at baseline includes but is not limited to all collected demographic variable 
such as age, gender, primary diagnosis, height, weight, Body- Mass-Index and medical history. 
The baseline variables will be used to describe the outcome data where necessary.   
EFFICACY ANALYSIS
Analysis of Primary Endpoint
Data will be collected on whether the septum wall appearance and need for re-intervention at 
the surgery site are due to the device or the procedure. Only those that are device-related will contribute to the primary endpoint analyses, in line with the primary objective of this study.  A
binary variable will be defined as follows; one if all five of the following criteria are true and [ADDRESS_140743] one of the criteria is false:
Septum wall straight appearance
Complete coaptation of perichondrial flaps on septum wall
Absence of significant local tissue reaction at the staple site
Absence of hematoma swelling at the staple site
No need for re-intervention at the surgery site
Clinical success will be inferred for a patient if their binary variable is 1. Clinical success will be 
reported as a count and percentage with a 95% CI using Clopper-Pearson Exact methodology. 
A logistic model will be used to evaluate the adjusted and unadjusted models for the primary outcome variable . The variables considered important and to be included in the final model are 
age and BMI. All other baseline and medical factors collected at baseline will be evaluated for

INTERIM ANALYSES
There are no formal interim analyses planned for this study, however Clinical Activity Reports 
(CAR) may be produced to faciliate the publication of the results for scientific conferences and 
publications. Additional adhoc analyses may occur as needed (e.g. for abstracts or publications). 
SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION
The results of a previous clinical study17 on an earlier generation of the study device found that

Adverse Event
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease of untoward
clinical sign (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether 
or not causally related to the IP/Ancillary Product.
Note 1: This definition includes events related to the IP, comparator or ancillary products. 
Note 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. 
Note 3: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to the IP
AE is used both to refer to AEwhich do not meet the definitions of Adverse Device Effects or 
Serious Adverse Events and as an umbrella term referring to adverse events of all 
classifications. 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease. For reporting purposes, emphasis is placed first and foremost on 
whether or not the event constitutes an untoward medical occurrence .

APPENDICES
PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 
General Purpose
It was requested by [CONTACT_125207], which stands for (Technischer Überwachungsverein, 
English translation: Technical Inspection Association), to update the protocol based on the 
feedback provided by [CONTACT_125208]. The following amendments were made to corr ect and 
clarify the protocol. This study will start subject enrollment with Protocol Version 2.0.
Rationale
The rationale for the changes are as follows:
Rationale 1 : Per the TUV review, the inclusion criteria are stricter than those mentioned 
in the IFU (e.g., age 18 and older). Removed age inclusion to allow the standard of care 
data to be collected for this study per the recommendations of the TUV. In 
addition, Section 7.5 wasupdated to include vulnerable populations and minors 
informed consent language.
Rationale 2 : Per the TUV review, the exclusion criteria exceeded those in the IFU (e.g., 
diabetes, pregnancy , previous septoplasty, smokers, etc.). Removed diabetes, previous 
septoplasty, and smokers as an exclusion criteria to allow the standard of care data to be collected for this study per the recommendations of the TUV. Clarification provided 
regarding pregnancy to pregnant at time of procedure.  Pregnant women, fetuses, and 
neonates are often considered vulnerable and protected by [CONTACT_125209]. Any elective surgeries such as a septoplasty are off-limits during pregnancy. Although work done to the nose has nothing to do with the womb, the sedation and medication will be harmful to the growing fetus. Subjects are allowed to continue participation in the trial if they do become pregnant after the procedure. The additional 
tests included in the study schematic do not pose a risk to the subject or the fetus.

TMP -CD-05-01 –Clinical Protocol -Device – Revision A; SOP- CD-05 Clinical Protocols
Rationale 3 : TUV requested further clarification regarding the sample size. As the sample 
size was not clear, explaining why an 80% power confidence is acceptable. Per ICH, E9 
guidance states that power should be greater than or equal to 80%. 80% is a widely used 
industry standard. Thirty-six subjects would provide us with at least 80% probability of 
obtaining a 2-sided 95% confidence interval, around the estimate proportion of 
successful fixations, to within ±11% precision. To allow for a 10% drop out rate, this study will enroll 40 subjects.Rationale 4 : TUV expressed concerns regarding the potential bias of the surgeon with 
follow up exams. Therefore a statement was added in Section 8.4.3; the follow -up 
exams will be delegated by [CONTACT_125210].
Rationale 5 : Sec tions 4.2, 4.2.2, and 4.4.[ADDRESS_140756] 
staple system safety data collected from literature. Tolerance limits for potential adverse 
effects were derived from Section 4.2.2.
Rationale 6 : Administrative changes, removing duplicate words, and adding citations.
Effect on Study Status
Not applicable; this amendment is to be in effect and implemented prior to subject enrollment

2. Synopsis  
Sample size  Minimum of 30 and maximum of 
40 subjects  
 
The results of a previous clinical 
study on previous generations 
of the study device found that 
92% of subj ects had successful 
fixation of tissue after one week. 
It is assumed that the study 
device will perform at least as 
well as the 92% found 
previously. Therefore based on 
statistical precision, the 
recruitment of [ADDRESS_140759] 80% 
probability of obtaining a 2 -
sided 95% confidence interval, 
around the estimate proportion 
of successful fixations of tissue, 
to within ±11% precision.

findings from s everal selected studies considered to be 
supportive of evide nce-based practices. The results of these 
studies are discussed in terms of their general conclusions.  
This report aims to identify clinical studies or usage of the current 
Smith & Nephew ENTACT S eptal Stapler through an extensive 
literature search.  
In the current evaluation, the PubMed online database (MedLine 
component) and Embase was used to find clinical results. The 
medical literature was searched for an unrestricted period of time 
through Ju ly 2019. The search was performed by a qualified 
Evidence Evaluation Specialist, in July, 2019.  
4.2.[ADDRESS_140764] Septal Stapler Complications  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Device related complications were reported in three studies.5,13,12 
Perforation was reported in two studies.5,12 Sainio et al.12  reported 
perforation in 1 patient (0.99%) in the ENTACT Stapler group and 
a reoperation was performed in this patient.  Sowerby [CONTACT_2297].5 
reported a 1 mm postoperative perforation occurred in one patient 
(12.5%) due to jamming of the ENTACT Septal Stapler (2009) and 
stated that this can be avoided with the newer model (2010/2012) 
of the stapler. Perforation was in line with other outcomes reported 
in the State of the Art for alternative devices for the Sainio12 study. 
In Sowerby [CONTACT_2297].5, the authors concluded that the septal stapler 
can be used without an increased morbidity in comparison to 
suture closure or impact to subjec tive patient scores.   
 
Tami et al13 reported that the first lot of ENTACT Septal Staplers 
(2009) failed to perform to design specifications and only four total 
staples from three staplers were implanted in one patient.  
 
Sainio et al.[ADDRESS_140765]

stated that “ENTACT Septal Stapler is safe to use”.  The 
complications reported in the four studies of the ENTACT stapler 
are performing in -line with alternative devices on the market as 
discussed in the State of the Art.  
 
Some of the minor complications observed in the literature were 
edema,  inflammation and infection. Sowerby [CONTACT_2297].[ADDRESS_140767] Septal 
Stapler to quilting sutures in patients undergoing septoplasty. 
Sowerby [CONTACT_2297] .5 observed mild edema in 2 patients in both the 
groups at a 3 week follow up. However, the edema resolved in 2 
months. In a prospective, case series13, mild inflammation was 
reported at a 1 week follow up in 21% of the patients in whom 
ENTACT Septal Stapler was used for approximation of 
mucoperichondrial flaps af ter septoplasty whereas no 
inflammation was observed in 79% of the patients. Expected rates 
of edema or inflammation following septoplasty were not 
discussed in the four publications identified. Other complications 
reported in the literature include bleedi ng,[ADDRESS_140768] Septal Stapler group (9.9%) and 
the subgroups such as silicone splint group (9.7%), suture group 
(12.7%), and the tamponade group (9.5%) in the non -stapler 
group.[ADDRESS_140769] (Next Generation) Septal Stapler  utilizes the 
same staples and a similar delivery mechanism to the previous 
ENTACT Septal Stapl er, it is anticipated that the Next G eneration 
device will perform the same as the previous generation device.

JustificationThe results of a previous clinical 
study17 on an earlier 
generation of the study device 
found that 92% of subjects had successful fixation of tissue 
after one week. It is assumed 
that the study device will perform at least as well as the 92% found previously. Therefore based on statistical 
precision, the recruitment of [ADDRESS_140780] 80% probability of obtaining a 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval, around the 
estimate proportion of 
successful fixations of tissue, to 
within ±11% precision.
The study will aim to enrol a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_140781] (Next Generation) will 
provide probabilities between 
78.4% and 90.3% of obtaining 
the 2 -sided 95% confidence 
interval of the success rate.The results of a previous clinical study17 on an earlier generation 
of the study device found that 92% of subjects had successful 
fixation of tissue after one week. It is assumed that the study 
device will perform at least as well as the 92% found previously. The ICH E9 guidance states that power should be greater than or 
equal to 80%.

probability of obtaining a 2-sided 95% confidence interval, around the estimate proportion of successful fixations of tissue, to within 
±11% precision. 
With the same assumption of clinical success rate and same 
precision target, enrolling [ADDRESS_140783] (Next Generation) will provide probabilities between 78.4% and 90.3% 
of obtaining the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the success 
rate. To allow for a 10% drop out rate, this study will enrol 40 
subjects.

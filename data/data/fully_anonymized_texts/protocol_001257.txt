efficacy, for further clinical development .  
• To obtain parallel descriptive information concerning the efficacy and safety of 
tocilizumab (TCZ) s.c.  in the same clinical trial RA population.  
 
 
Study T ype and Treatments Administered : 
 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, Phase  IIb study of ALX -0061 
administered s.c. as monotherapy to subjects with active RA who are intolerant to 
methotrexate (MTX) or for whom continued MTX treatment is inappropriate.  
 This study consists of 2  parallel segments : a double -blind segment to assess the 
efficacy and safety of ALX -0061, and an open -label, joint assessor -blinded segment  
with TCZ s.c., which is not in tended to be an active comparator but to provide 
parallel efficacy and safety data for TCZ in the same RA population.  
 
Treatment Arms  
 Eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. 
Subjects assigned to one of the ALX -0061 treatment groups and investigators will 
be blinded to dose assignment  (double -blind segment); subjects assigned to the 
TCZ treatment group will receive open -label treatment (open -label segment). 
Subjects will be stratified based on TCZ dosing regimen . 
 Subjects assigned to one of the 3 ALX-0061 treatment groups will receive blinded 
treatment with ALX -0061 at a dose of 150  mg every 4  weeks (q4w), 150  mg every 
2 weeks (q2w), or [ADDRESS_744685] ions q2w, subjects in Groups 1  and 2  will also be 
administered 2 injections q2w , with 1 or both syringes containing placebo, 
depending on the assigned treatment group , to maintain the blind:  
 
Group 1 (N=57) 150 mg ALX -0061 q4w  
ALX-0061 150 mg s.c. injectio ns (1 syringe [1.0 mL]) at 
Week  0 and q4w thereafter up to and including Week  8. To 
maintain the blind, subjects in this group will also receive 
placebo s.c. up to and including Week  10 (1 placebo  syringe 
[0.5 mL] at Week  0 and q4w thereafter in combinatio n with 
the ALX -0061 injection; 2 placebo syringes [0.5 and 1.0  mL] 
at Week  2 and q 4w thereafter) .  
 
Group 2 (N=57) 150 mg ALX- 0061 q2w  
ALX-0061 150 mg s.c. injections (1 syringe [1.0  mL]) at

at Week  0 and q2w thereafter up to and including Week  10. 
These subjects will not receive placebo injections.  
 
Subjects randomized to the TCZ treatment arm will receive open -label treatment 
(open -label segment). Note that since there is a difference in the approved dosing 
frequency  in the US , following FDA label  (q2w for subjects weighing <  100 kg and 
weekly [q1w] for those ≥ 100 kg) versus Europe, following EMA label (q1w for all 
patients), 2 different dosing regimens for TCZ are included in the study.  Subjects 
will be stratified based on the TCZ dosing regimen  used per region .

In countries where open -label extension (OLE) study ALX006 1-C203 is approved, 
subjects who complete the 12 -week assessment period of the current study will be 
invited to roll-over. Details on the  open-label extension (OLE)  study are described 
in Clinical Study Protocol  ALX0061- C203. Subjects who were assigned to the TCZ

Sample size and Power  
Up to approximately 228 subjects in 4 treatment arms will be  randomized in a 
1:1:1:[ADDRESS_744694] been made ; a justification for the 
sample size is available in section  3.6.8 of the Clinical Study Protocol . 
 
Primary Efficacy  Endpoint Evaluation : 
The primary efficacy endpoint (ACR20 response at Week 12) will be summarized for 
each treatment group. Differences in response between treatment groups and 
associated 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  The open -label, joint 
assessor -blinded segment with TCZ s.c. is not intended to be an active comparator 
but to provide parallel efficacy and safety data for TCZ in the same RA population.  
Data will be analyzed according to the intent -to-treat principle; thus, subjects will 
be an alyzed according to the treatment for which they were assigned. Subjects with 
missing ACR20 response at Week  12 will be treated as non -responders (non -
responder imputation approach).  Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0140          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28/107 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
ALX-0061 has been developed by [CONTACT_14547] a new compound neutralizing the 
pro-inflammatory activity of the interleukin -6 (IL-6) pathway. Based on its mode of 
action, ALX -0061 is currently in development for the treatment of autoimmune 
diseases such as RA and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).   
 
The currently proposed clinical study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different dose regimens of ALX -0061 monotherapy administered subcutaneously  
(s.c.) to subject s with active RA.  
 
1.1.  RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS  
 
RA is a chronic systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease that affects 0.5 -1% of 
the population and is 3 times more prevalent in women than in men [1]. It is 
clinically characterized by [CONTACT_163161], stiffness , and swelling due to synovial 
inflammation, leading to joint damage, deformity, severe disability , and increased 
mortality. Patients may develop multiple systemic symptoms incl uding fever, 
fatigue, anemia, and osteoporosis.  
 
1.1.1.  TREATMENT OF RHEUMATOID 
ARTHRITIS  
 
The goal of therapy is to reduce inflammation, inhibit joint damage, prevent loss of function, decrease pain , and improve function as well as quality of life. Initial 
treatment options include disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, analgesics, surgery, 
physiotherapy , and occupational therapy.  
 The synthetic DMARDs most commonly used include methotrexate (MTX), 
sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, cyclosporine A , and glucocorticoids. 
The therapeutic benefits of DMARDs in RA include control of signs and symptoms, improvement of functional status and of quality of life, and retardation of join t 
damage progression [2]. MTX administered alone or in combination with another 
conventional DMARD, is the recommended first -line therapy for patients with RA 
[3].  
 
For patients  with an inadequate response to conventional DMARDs, biological drugs 
in combination with MTX is the usual treatment option. These biological  drugs block 
certain key molecules that are involved in the p athogenesis of the illness. These 
targets  include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α), selective T -cell costimulation 
molecule  (such as CTLA4), cluster of differentiation 20 ( CD20 ), interleukin -1 (IL-1), Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0140          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29/107 IL-6, and interleukin -6 receptor (IL -6R). The development of immune -modulating 
agents has offered new treatment options for patients . 
 
Although anti -TNF α agents and other biological DMARDs have been established as 
effective treatment options for RA, there are reasons to study the effectiveness and the maintenance of response of new therapeutic agents. For example, there is a 
subset of the patient population that does not achieve a clinical response, defined 
as American College of Rheumatology (ACR ) 20 response, and only a small 
proportion achieve a high level ACR response (ACR50 or ACR70) [4].  
 While  therapy with biological DMARDs has been successful in t he treatment of RA, 
certain patients may lose clinical response over time for various reasons such as 
disease burden, low drug serum levels, rapid clearance, and immunogenicity, i n 
addition to other limitations with respect to safety, dosing regimen, and w ay of 
administration. Thus there is the potential for new therapeutic agents to address 
some of these limitations and to improve the long -term effectiveness and safety of 
biological agents in treating RA.  
 
When co -administered with MTX, enhanced efficacy has been observed for 
anti-TNF-α agents compared to anti -TNF-α monotherapy  [5]. This is also the case 
for rituximab as well as for abatacept , where monotherapy is inferior to 
combination treatment.  Clinical evidence also demonstrates that there is less 
radiographic progression in patients treated with combination therapy. Data shows 
that both direct and indirect effects potentially account for the enhanced efficacy of  
anti-TNFs plus MTX  [5].  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_45478] -established benefits of anti -TNF α agents when administered in 
combination with conventional DMARDs and the limited approval of biologics as monotherapy, biologic monotherapy in the treatment of RA is common in clinical 
practice. Patients and physicians may discontinue MTX -treatment for a number of 
reasons, including gastrointestinal, hepatic, dermatologic as well as neurologic 
AEs [5]. Patients who discontinue MTX because of intolerance or for whom 
continued trea tment with MTX is inappropriate  may benefit from monotherapy 
treatment with biologics. So far, only tocilizumab (TCZ) provides a robust and 
clinically sufficient alternative for biological monotherapy in patients who cannot be treated with MTX. Thus there is a need for effective and safe biologic treatment 
options that do not require co -administration of MTX.

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30/107 glycoprotein 130 ( gp130) , responsible for signal transduction and activation of the 
cell [6]. IL-6R is present not only as a membrane bound form but also as a soluble 
form. sIL- 6R can interact with IL -6 and this complex can activate gp130 -positive 
cells without the presence of membrane -bound (m)IL -6R on the surface of the 
cells. This process is called trans- signaling and implies that mIL-6R negative cells 
are also susceptible to activation, with soluble IL -6R acting as an agonist  [6, 7].  
 
As IL- 6 is a pleiotropic cytokine, its function is highly diverse. Many studies 
revealed that this molecule,  by [CONTACT_441224] -6R and gp130 , plays a role 
in the immune, hematopoietic, hepatic , and neuronal systems  [8, 9].  
 
IL-6 plays also a critical role in different aspects of RA such as the transition from 
the acute phase of the inflammation to the chronic irreversible status [10], 
stimulation of B cells to produce auto -antibodies, cartilage destruction [11], or 
anemia [12]. 
 
High concentrations of IL -[ADDRESS_744704] been documented in the serum of RA and juvenile 
RA patients [13]. Several studies have shown that sIL -6R is also elevated in both 
RA and systemic onset juvenile RA patients [14]. Analysis of the IL- 6 and sIL -6R 
concentrations in synovial fluid showed that the extent of joint destruction correlated with increased concentrations of both ligand and receptor [13]. However, 
resident cells of the joint (chondr ocytes,  synoviocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells) 
do not express mIL -6R, indicating that high levels of sIL -6R are likely to be 
expressed by [CONTACT_441225] [14]. This indicates that sIL- 6R is important in 
the chronic inflammatory setting of RA.  
 
Based on the findings that the IL -[ADDRESS_744705] inhibitors can improve 
manifestations of RA, supporting the concept that IL -6 signaling plays a key role in 
RA. 
 For TCZ there is evidence that the efficacy of monotherapy is comparable to 
co-administration of TCZ with MTX. Monotherapy with TCZ has been investigated 
extensively and has demonstrated greater efficacy than MTX/DMARDs in lowering 
disease activity and reducing radiographi c progression [5].

The following paragraphs provide summary information on ALX -0061; for more 
detailed background information, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure . 
 
1.2.1.  GENERAL PROPERTIES  
 The active component in ALX-0061 solution for injection  is a therapeutic protein, 
designated “ALX- 0061 Nanobody”. Nanobodies are therapeutic proteins that are 
derived from the smallest functional fragments of heavy c hain only antibodies, 
which occur naturally in the Camelidae  family. They have a high degree of 
homology (in terms of sequence and structure) to human immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH) domains, and can be further engineered and expressed 
by [CONTACT_441226][INVESTIGATOR_349539] . 
 
ALX-0061 Nanobody consists of 2 humanized and sequence- optimized variable 
domains derived from heavy chain -only llama  antibodies : 
• One domain (designated 20A11) binds to human IL -6R.  
• The second domain (designated ALB11) binds to human serum albumin (HSA), 
as a means to improve the PK properties of the Nanobod y (half -life extension).  
 
ALX-0061 Nanobody inhibits the interaction between the IL -6 ligand and the 
receptor subunit, thereby [CONTACT_441227] . ALX -0061 has a higher 
affinity for sIL -6R than for mIL -6R, and thus preferentially targets sIL -6R (the 
trans-signaling pathway). This target binding profile of ALX -0061 may result in a 
stronger engagement of the disease- driving target form (sIL -6R) [7] in a 
physiological situation with both forms (sIL -6R and mIL -6R) p resent.  
 
The second domain of ALX -[ADDRESS_744706] abundant 
protein in plasma and has a half -life of approximately 19 days in humans [15]. 
Binding to albumin (as a carrier) has been shown to lead to retention of the bound 
protein in circulation, with a resident time approaching that of the carrier molecule [15].  
 
1.2.2.  MANUFACTURE  
 
The manufacture of ALX- 0061 Nanobody consists of an upstream  process (i.e., 
fermentation of a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_566955]-[ADDRESS_744707] into the medium), and a downstream process (essentially harvest, capture, intermediate purification, polish , and formulation of the 
Nanobod y). Additional information on the manufacture and pharmaceutical 
properties of ALX -0061 is included in the Investigator’s Brochure.  Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0140          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

Pharmacology 
ALX-0061 was extensively characterized in vitro . The in vivo  efficacy and the PK/PD 
properties of ALX -0061 were examined in naive cynomolgus monkeys, in an acute 
cynomolgus monkey model of IL -6-induced inflammation, and in a collagen -induced 
arthritis model in rhesus monkey. PK was assessed during the toxicology studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys (toxicokinetics [TK]). Additionally, the impact of anti -drug 
antibodies (ADA) on the PK and PD of ALX -0061 was evaluated.  
 Toxicology 
The toxicology program was carried out in cynomolgus monkeys, and consists of a single -dose intravenous ( i.v.) dose-range finding toxicity study, a Good Laboratory 
Practice ( GLP)-compliant 13 -week repeated -dose i.v. toxicity study , a 
GLP-compliant 4 -week repeated dose i.v./s.c. toxicity study, and a 26 -week 
repeated -dose i.v. toxicity study.  
 All relevant nonclinical studies  conducted with ALX -0061 are described in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. The nonclinical data revealed no specific safety risks, 
based on the available safety pharmacology data, and local and systemic 
tolerability assessment.  
 
1.2.4.  EFFECTS IN HUMANS  
 A combined Phase I/II study in subjects with moderately to severely active RA, on a 
stable background of MTX, has been completed ( Study ALX -0061- 1.1/10).  This 
placebo -controlled study  included 28  subjects in an initial single ascending dose 
(SAD) part where single i.v . doses of 0.3, 1, 3 , or 6 mg/kg were administered. In a 
subsequent multiple ascending dose (MAD) part, 37  subjects received multiple i.v. 
doses of 1 or 3  mg/kg every 4 weeks (q4w), or 6  mg/kg every 8 weeks, for 
24 weeks in total.   
 
A Phase I study (Study ALX0061- C102) assessing the bioavailability of single doses 
of ALX -0061, administered s.c. at 3 dose levels, using 2  corresponding single i.v. 
dose levels as reference, in healthy adult volunteers, has been completed. This study included 70 subjects and studied doses of 50, 150, and 300  mg. The PK and 
PD results were used to bridge from i.v. to s.c. administration, and to determine 
the appropriate doses for the current Phase II study.

SUBJECTS WITH MODERATELY TO 
SEVERELY ACTIVE RHE UMATOID 
ARTHRITIS  
 
The results of the SAD and MAD parts of this study are discussed in detail in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, and are briefly summarized below.  
 
Efficacy  
In the MAD part of the study, all ALX -0061 treatment combinations showed rapid 
and l ong-lasting improvements in disease activity (as measured by [CONTACT_104706], EULAR, 
Disease Activity Score using 28  joint counts (DAS28) [CRP], Clinical Disease 
Activity Index (CDAI), and Boolean remission responses). There were high numbers 
of responders in all ALX -0061 treatment groups, with DAS28 remission observed in 
63% of ALX -0061- treated subjects at Week 24, and none of the ALX -0061- treated 
subjects showed worsening of disease activity during the study period.  Overall, the 
efficacy profile obtained at Week  [ADDRESS_744708]- order 
(linear total body clearance [CL]) and Michaelis -Menten elimination (nonlinear or 
concentration -dependent CL) describes well the PK behavior of the drug, and is 
consistent with the more than proportional increase of exposure and half -life of the 
drug with the increa se of the dose. Similar to monoclonal antibodies, the Nanobod y 
has a limited volume of distribution, corresponding to the plasma volume. As the PK 
of ALX -0061 is dose -dependent due to a different contribution of the non- linear 
clearance at different serum concentrations, also the terminal half -life (t 1/2) is dose -
dependent. At high concentrations, when non -linear clearance becomes negligible, 
the apparent t 1/2 estimated from the linear clearance  term only, is estimated at 
approximately 15 days.  
 
Pharmacodyn amics  
• All ALX -0061 groups received biologically effective doses: rapid and long -lasting 
increases in IL- 6 and sIL -6R concentrations were observed across all ALX -0061 
dose groups. The PD results confirmed that sIL -6R (and IL -6) concentrations can 
be used as  a biomarker for target engagement by [CONTACT_439957] -0061.  
• Dosing q4w at 3  mg/kg yielded the highest exposure, as indicated by [CONTACT_441228] (~ 10  µg/mL), strongest biomarker response 
(based on sIL -6R profile), and the highest clinical remission rates.

• Single and repeated administration of ALX -0061 was well tolerated in all 
treatment groups, with a manageable and consistent safety profile for all 
ALX-0061 dose combinations.  
• In the MAD part, the most commonly reported AEs observed after intake of ALX-0061 included headache, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), arthralgia, back pain, and joint swelling. Most of the events were mild or moderate and resolved during the treatment period.  
• There were no clear trends in the occurrence or type of treatment -related AEs 
when comparing the individual ALX -[ADDRESS_744709] that a maximum tolerated dose was reached.  
• [ADDRESS_744710] (3  mg/kg ALX -0061) experienced an acute 
hypersensitivity during the first infusion of ALX -0061, which was stopped 
immediately. The subject was successfully treated in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_441209] -
histaminic drugs, prednisone, and salbutamol.  
- In the MAD part of the  study, [ADDRESS_744711] (3  mg/kg q4w ALX -0061) experienced 
an SAE of cerebrovascular accident after having received [ADDRESS_744712] with a confirmed Helicobacter pylori  gastritis and history of 
short NSAID intake experienced an SAE of h emorrhagic gastritis (not related) 
and a linked SAE of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (remotely related). Both SAEs resolved before the end of the study.  
• Four subjects reported treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) leading to withdrawal of 
study drug in the MAD part of the study: [ADDRESS_744713] with the SAE cerebrovascular 
accident (described above), [ADDRESS_744714] with rash and non- immunoglobulin (Ig) E 
mediated hypersensitivity reaction (probably related to the study drug), 
[ADDRESS_744715] with uncontrolled hypertension (remotely related to the study drug), 
and [ADDRESS_744716] (remotely related to the study drug).  
• Regarding laboratory abnormalities, a rapid and reversible decrease in 
neutrophils and platelets was seen in the majority of subjects after 
administration of ALX -0061. These decreases in neutrophil and platelet count 
seemed to be dose -related but did not reach clinically relevant levels. No AEs 
related to the decreases in neutrophil and platelet count (or other hematology 
parameters) were reported , except for [ADDRESS_744717] with mild leukopenia (without 
neutropenia).

VOLUNTEERS  
 
Overall, a single s.c. dose of ALX -0061 in the dose range of 50 to 300 mg was safe 
and well -tolerated in a group of 70 healthy  male and female subjects.  The s.c. 
bioavailability of ALX -0061 was 82 .3% as estimated by [CONTACT_78013].  
 
There were no severe AEs, deaths, other SAEs or AEs that resulted in study drug 
discontinuation.  
 
In the s.c. treatment groups, the majority  of possibly related adverse events were 
injection site reactions (mainly pain and erythema), which appeared to be dose-dependent across the dose range tested (50  mg to 300 mg). All injection site 
reactions were transient and of mild intensity and apart fr om these reactions, no 
specific adverse events were reported very frequently or showed a dose relationship. No differences were observed compared to the i.v. administration 
groups.  
 As expected from the mechanism of action, a  mild transient decrease in f ibrinogen, 
neutrophils  and hsCRP levels was observed following administration of ALX -0061. 
One subject in the [ADDRESS_744718] -dose up to a maximum of 150 U/L at [ADDRESS_744719] and no rise in bilirubin. The ALT level had returned to baseline at follow -up.

Phase II study and are summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
 
1.2.5.  BENEFITS AND RISK AS SESSMENT  
 Although a number of treatment options are available for RA, there remains a clear 
need for novel therapeutics. Many patients do not benefit optimally from the 
available small molecule and biologic drugs, leaving opportunity for differentiated 
drugs with new modes of action and an improved safety profile.  
 Considering the importance of IL -[ADDRESS_744720] inhibitors can improve 
manifestations of RA.  ALX-0061,  administered i.v. and in combination with MTX, Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0140          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36/[ADDRESS_744721], as well as 
potential risks inherent to the administration of therapeutic proteins,  are 
considered.  
 
• Inhibition of the IL -[ADDRESS_744722] has immunomodulatory effects, and has been 
reported to increase the risk for infection [16, 17]. So far, serious infections 
have not been reported for ALX -0061.  
 
• Suppression of IL -6 activity is known to reduce the levels of  acute phase proteins 
such as CRP, SAA and fibrinogen [18, 19] .  
- Rapid and long -lasting decreases in CRP, ES R, fibrinogen and SAA were 
observed across all ALX -0061 dose groups in study ALX- 0061- 1.1/10. In 
general, these pharmacological effects were reversible and associated with 
clinical response in signs and symptoms of RA.  
- In study ALX0061 -C102, results indic ate a trend towards a minor decrease in 
fibrinogen and (hs)CRP levels following administration of ALX -[ADDRESS_744723] 
subjects.  
 
• Suppression of IL-6 signaling has been shown to lead to decreases in neutrophil 
and platelet counts [20].  
- In study ALX -0061- 1.1/10, a rapid and reversible decrease in neutrophils and 
platelets was seen in the majority of subjects after administration of 
ALX-0061. No TEAEs related to the decreases in neutrophil and platelet count 
(or other hematology parameters) were reported, except for [ADDRESS_744724] with 
mild leukopenia (without neutropenia; MAD part of the study).  
- In study ALX0061- C102, the results show a tendency towards a transient and  
mild decrease neutrophil count.

concentrations, or other safety -related biochemistry parameters across dose 
levels in study ALX -0061- 1.1/10 or ALX0061- C102.  
 
• Recent data indicate that RA subjects have a generally increased rate of 
gastrointestinal (GI) perforation [22]. At this time, it is not clear whether IL -[ADDRESS_744726] been 
observed following ALX -0061 administration.  
 
• As with all therapeutic proteins used in humans, infusion reactions (e. g., either 
anaphylactic or anaphylactoid) cannot be excluded.  
- In Study ALX -0061- 1.1/10, t wo hypersensitivity reactions were reported (one 
serious and one moderate) . For additional details, please refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure . 
- In study ALX0061- C102, no hypersensitivity reactions were reported.  
 
• Administration of any protein therapeutic can lead to the development  of ADA 
[23]. The currently available immunogenicity (ADA) results after i.v. and s.c. 
administration of ALX -0061 do not indicate meaningful risks related to pre -
existing or treatment -emergen t antibodies to ALX- 0061.  
 
In view of the early stage of development, it is not established whether the above mentioned effects would constitute clinically meaningful risks for administration of 
ALX-0061; additional clinical studies are needed for further evaluation. In general, 
the pharmacological effects reported during Study ALX -0061- 1.1/10 were reversible 
and associated with clinical response in signs and symptoms of RA.  For additional

3.1.1.  STUDY OVERVIEW  
 
This multicenter, randomized, double -blind Phase IIb study is being conducted to 
evaluate efficacy and safety of do se regimens of ALX -0061 administered s.c. as 
monotherapy in subjects with active RA who are intolerant to MTX or for whom 
continued MTX treatment is inappropriate . It is estimated that 228 subjects will be 
enrolled.  An overview of the study design is included in Figure 1 .

OLE: open -label extension study ALX0061 -C203 (in countries where study ALX0061 -C203 is approved,  
eligible ALX-0061-treated subjects who complete the 12 -week assessment period of the current study 
will be invited to roll- over). q1w: every week, q2 w: every 2 weeks, q4 w: every 4 weeks, TCZ: 
tocilizumab. 
 
This study consists of 2 parallel segments : a dou ble-blind segment to assess the 
efficacy and safety of ALX -0061 and an open -label, joint assessor- blinded segment  
with TCZ s.c., which is not intended to be an active comparator but to provide 
parallel efficacy and safety data for TCZ in the same RA popula tion.  
 
The ALX-0061 dosing regimens (150 mg q4w, 150 mg q2w, or 225 mg q2w) have 
been determined based on : 
 
• Expected DAS28 response, ensuring characterization of the exposure -response 
curve (PK/PD modelling approach).  
• Safety margins calculated by [CONTACT_226412] e relevant observed exposure in nonclinical 
studies (cynomolgus monkey) versus the model -predicted human exposure of 
the selected dosing regimens for the clinical studies.  
• Operational feasibility aspects for the study .

The ACR20 response  was chosen as primary endpoint since this is a broadly 
accepted clinical response measure to demonstrate reduction in RA signs. For 
details on primary statistical analysis in this study , please refer to section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
The proposed statistical approach will allow to evaluate potential differences in 
early clinical efficacy between the doses.  
 Note that higher levels of response, as measured by [CONTACT_104706]50 and ACR70 re sponse 
rates, and measures of remission, using the DAS28, CDAI, SDAI , as well as the 
Boolean remission definition, will be used as supportive evidence of efficacy. In 
addition, endpoints including ACR responses and disease activity scores will be 
documente d over time , including earlier time points . Other RA domains, such as 
improvement in physical function and health -related quality of life, will be evaluated 
using the HAQ -DI, FACIT-F atigue scale  and the SF -36 questionnaires.  
 Safety and tolerability asses sments will include evaluation of AEs (including serious 
adverse events, infections, injection site and hypersensitivity reactions ), laboratory 
assessment, urinalysis, vital signs, and physical examination.  
 
Additional planned assessments include the d etermination of ALX -0061 levels in 
serum, and PD biomarkers (including sIL-6R) in blood . To assess immunogenicity, 
the presence of ADA will be measured in serum until the F ollow-up Visit, with 
potentially further characterization by [CONTACT_441223] ( mADA) a nd neutralizing 
antibody assay (nAb). 
 
Study Treatment Allocation  
At the Screening Visit, informed consent will be obtained from all subjects who are 
deemed potentially eligible for the study, according to the protocol -specified 
inclusion and exclusion cri teria. At randomization, subjects will be reassessed and, 
if they meet all specified entry  criteria, randomized to receive either ALX -0061 or 
TCZ, as described below  (also see section 3.3.8 for additional information on 
randomization) . Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0140          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41/107 Eligible subjects will be random ly assigned  in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the treatment  
groups listed below. Subjects assigned to one of the ALX -0061 treatment groups 
and investigators  will be blinded to dose assignment (double -blind segment); 
subjects assigned to the TCZ treatment group will receive open -label treatment 
(open -label segment). Subjects will be stratified based on TCZ dosing regimen .   
 
Treatment Arms  
Subjects assigned to one of the 3 ALX -0061 treatment groups will receive blinded  
treatment with ALX -0061 at a dose of 150  mg every 4  weeks (q4w), 150  mg every 
2 weeks (q2w), or [ADDRESS_744730] dose of ALX -0061 will be 
administered via 2  injections q2w, subjects in Groups 1 and 2 will also be 
administered 2 injections q2w with 1 or both syringes containing placebo, 
depending on the assigned treatment group, to maintain the blind:  
 
Group 1 (N=57)  150 mg ALX -0061 q4w  
ALX-0061 150 mg s.c. injections (1 syringe [1.0 mL]) at 
Week  0 and q4w thereafter up to and including Week  8. To  
maintain the blind, subjects in this group will also receive placebo s.c. q2w up to and including Week  10 (1 
placebo  syringe [0.5  mL] at Week  0 and q4w thereafter in 
combination with the ALX -0061 injection; 2 placebo syringes 
[0.5 and 1.0  mL] at Week  2 and q4w thereafter).  
 
Group 2 (N=57)  150 mg ALX -0061 q2w  
ALX-0061 150 mg s.c. injections (1  syringe [1.0  mL]) at 
Week  0 and q2w thereafter up to and including Week  10. To 
maintain the blind, subjects in this group will also receive placebo s.c. q2w up to an d including Week  10 (1 placebo 
syringe [0.5  mL]).  
 
Group 3 (N=57)  225 mg ALX -0061 q2w  
ALX-0061 225 mg s.c. injections (2 syringes  [0.5 and 1.0  mL]) 
at Week  0 and q2w thereafter up to and including Week  10. 
These subjects will not receive placebo injection s.  
 Subjects randomized to the TCZ treatment arm will receive open -label treatment 
(open -label segment). Note that since there is a difference in the approved dosing 
frequency in the US, following FDA label (q2w for subjects weighing < 100 kg and 
weekly [q1w] for those ≥ 100 kg) versus Europe, following EMA label (q1w for all 
patients), 2 different dosing regimens for TCZ are included in the study. Subjects 
will be stratified based on the TCZ dosing regimen  used per region . 
 
Group 4 (N=57) 162 mg TCZ q1w or q2w 
Subjects assigned to the q2w TCZ treatment group: TCZ 
162 mg s.c. injections at Week 0 and q2w thereafter, up to 
and including Week  10. Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0140          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

3.3.6.  PRIOR AND CONCOMITAN T THERAPY  
 Prior and concomitant medication are documented throughout the study.  
 Prior medications as  per in - and exclusion criteria are detailed in section  3.2.   
 
During the screening  and 12-week treatment and assessment period of the study, 
subjects are not allowed to initiate DMARD treatmen t for RA (see prohibited 
medication below).
  
 Permitted Medication  
Subject s treated with NSAIDs, including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_247861] 2  
inhibitors, and other analgesics (except high -potency opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], such as 
World Health Organization ( WHO) class IV drugs [e.g.,  morphine ; see prohibited

NSAIDs and other analgesics should not be administer ed within 6 hours before 
study assessments. Long -acting ones can be maintained at their usual dosing 
intervals before study assessments.  
 
Subjects treated with oral corticosteroids should receive a stable dose equivalent to 
≤ 10 mg of prednisone/day for at lea st [ADDRESS_744761] develops unaccepta ble side effects.  
 The number of i ntra-articular  corticosteroid  injections is limited to 1 injection over a 
12-week period. Intra -articular injection may not be given from Week  8 until 
Week  12. The joint(s) affected by [CONTACT_164532](s) will be considered as swollen 
and tender for 28  days/[ADDRESS_744762].  
 The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by [CONTACT_8668] -6. IL-6 blocking 
might therefore influence (normalize) CYP450 expression and products which are 
substrates for CYP450 enzymes (e.g., statins, warfarin, theophylline, oral 
contraceptives, calcium antagonists, phenytoin, cyclosporine, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) 
could be metabolized faster. Subjects taking medicinal products which are metabolized via CYP450 [ADDRESS_744763] to  be adapted if necessary in order to maintain therapeutic efficacy. 
Subjects on warfarin will  be monitored by [CONTACT_441241] (See Schedule of 
Assessments ); the lipid levels will be evaluated which will be of help to monitor the 
subjects on statins (See Schedule of Assessments ). If needed, the Investigator  or 
the relevant treating physician should adapt the treatment of the concerned subject  
(unscheduled visits can be planned upon the discretion of the treating physician). Given the long half -life of ALX -0061, the influence on the hepatic enzymes can 
persist for several weeks.  
 Other medication (e.g., to treat AEs) may only be prescribed after consultation with 
the Investigator, unless in case of an emergency situation that does not allow discussion. 
 
Prohibited Medication  
 
The following medications are prohibited during the study  (up to and including the

At screening, which will take place within [ADDRESS_744769] administration 
of study drug, subjects will be asked to attend the clinical site to be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria ( section  3.2) and to have other 
assessments performed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.  
 Subject s who signed an informed consent form, but do not meet the eligibility 
criteria and are not randomized, will be designated a screen failure. Subjects who 
meet all eligibility criteria but discontinue from th e study for other reasons (eg, 
subject request) will not be considered screen failures.  
  
Data of  all subjects screened will be collected in the (e)CRF in order to assess the 
numbers and characteristics of the excluded subjects, and the reasons for their 
exclusion. 
 The results from the screening procedures needed to evaluate eligibility must be 
available prior to the first administration of the study drug. Sites will use the central 
laboratory selected for the study to analyze  screening samples and to use these 
reported values to determine eligibility.  
 
Unscheduled visits may be planned to assess, confirm, and follow up on clinically 
relevant AEs or laboratory abnormalities. Findings made during these unscheduled visits should be reported in the designated  sections of the (e)CRF.

All joints listed are used in the determination of the ACR response, whe re 68 joints 
are assessed for tenderness and 66 joints are assessed for swelling (see 
Appendix  9). The 28 joints indicated in the grey -shaded fields are used to 
determine the DAS28, CDAI, SDAI , and Boolean score . 
 If tenderness or swelling is noted, enter a “1” for that joint in the appropriate field. 
If tenderness or swelling is absent, enter a “0” for that joint in the appropriate field.  
 Joints that undergo intra-articular  corticosteroid injection will be cons idered as 
swollen and tender for 28  days/[ADDRESS_744779].   
 
An independent joint assessor (and backup independent joint assessor) will be 
designated at each study center to perform all joint assessments during the 
12-weeks assessment period of the study . This individual should have at least 
1 year of experience in performing joint assessments. The proposed assessors 
having less than 1 year experience will need to be approved by [CONTACT_1034]. The 
independent  joint assessor will perform only the joint assessments; this individual 
will not perform or assist in any other assessments in the study.   
 The CRO will provide training to an independent assessor from each site prior to the 
start of subject enrollment. In case the independent assessor cannot attend, the 
CRO will provide training to the Investigator who will then train the assessor. If 
possible, the independent  assessor for the study should not be changed during the 
study. However, the independent  assessors from each site may train additional 
assessors at the site for coverage during their absences.  If more than [ADDRESS_744780]  be listed in the ”Investigator

The DAS28 based on ESR is a statistically derived index combining TJC (28 joints),  
SJC (28 joints), ESR, and VASPA [27]. It is a continuous parameter and is defined 
as specified in Figure  2 [28]: 
 Figure 2: Calculation of DAS28 (ESR) Score  
DAS28  (ESR )=�0.56×�𝑇𝑇𝑇28 �+�0.28×�𝑆𝑇𝑇28�+(0.70×Ln[ESR ])+(0.014 ×VASPA )  
VASPA=GH  
 
As the results of ESR will be blinded to the investigative sites, the DAS28 will not be 
calculated on site but during the statistical analysis by [CONTACT_441246] -CRO. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  DAS28 SCORE USING CR P 
 CRP will be used in addition to ESR in the calculation of DAS28, using the formula 
below. CRP is a more direct measure of inflammation than ESR and it is more sensitive to short -term changes [29]. CRP is considered at least as valid as ESR to 
measure RA disease activity [30]. 
 The DAS28 using CRP is a statistically derived index combining TJC (28 joints), SJC 
(28 joints), CRP (mg/L), and VASPA. The DAS28 is a continuous parameter and is 
defined as specified in Figure  3 [28]:

Cut-off points for DAS28   to define if a subject  is in clinical remission or in a state of 
high, moderate , or low disease activity have been defined [28]: 
 
High disease activity  DAS28 > 5.1  
Moderate disease activity  3.2 < DAS28 ≤ 5.1 
Low disease activity  2.6 ≤ DAS28 ≤ 3.2

of the safety summaries, the DSMB’s role and responsibilities, and the general 
procedures (including communications).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 General information on evaluation and reporting of AEs is provided in section  3.5. 
 All AEs occurring during the clinical investigation must be documented in the source documents and the (e)CRF . 
 Criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding (e.g., 
laboratory, vital signs), a complication of a protocol mandated procedure (e.g., 
blood draw , inje ction of study drug) or a change in physical examination findings 
should be reported as an AE are as follows, but not limited to: 
 
1. Result /finding  is associated with accompanying clinical signs and symptoms, 
and/or  
2. Result/finding requires extra diagnostic testing (other than diagnostic exclusion tests) or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
3. Result /finding  would require  a change in study dosing or discontinuation from 
the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, 
and/or  
4. Result/finding leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of an SAE, 
and/or  
5. Result/finding is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_737].  Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0140          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

• result s in death . 
 
All serious infections should be reported as SAE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  LABORATORY ASSESSMEN TS 
 
Blood samples for routine and extended (including fasting serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]) clinical 
laboratory analysis will be collected at the time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments.   
In general, blood samples will be collected via an indwelling i.v. catheter or by 
[CONTACT_37277]. Details on method, sampling and processing procedures will be provided in a separate L ab Manual.  
 The following tests will be included in the routine clinical laboratory analysis : 
• Biochemistry: total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma -glutamyltransferase, 
AST, ALT, lactate dehydrogenase , creatinine, urea, total protein, albumin, 
glucose , inorganic phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride.  
• Hematology: leukocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, thrombocytes, partial automated differentiation  (lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, 
basophils, neutrophil s), mean corpuscular volume , mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular  hemoglobin concentration . 
• Acute phase proteins: fibrinogen, CRP, and ESR.  
• Urinalysis: erythrocytes/blood, urobilinogen, ketones, glucose, protein, pH, leukocytes.  
• Coagulation: activated partial prothrombin time, prothrombin time, INR (the latter for subjects on warfarin only).  
 
The following additional tests will be included in the extended clinical laboratory 
analysis:  
• Biochemistry: total cholesterol, HDL -cholesterol, LDL -cholesterol, and 
triglyceri des (i.e., fasting serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]).  
 Note that at visits when extended clinical laboratory analysis samples are planned to be tak en, samples should be taken pre dose after the subject has been fasting for 
at least 10  h. Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0140          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

time points as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments. Of note, a dditional 
pregnancy testing is allowed according to local guidelines; however,  this additional 
pregnanc y testing is not part of and cannot replace the protocol specific procedures.  
 
At screening, seropositivity for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti -HIV1 and anti -HIV2 will 
be tested and the levels of Rheumatoid Factor and anti-CCP antibodies will be 
determined.  
 
In addition, an IGRA test to detect latent or active TB and a chest radiograph 
(performed within 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit or performed during the 
screening period) to detect evidence of malignancy, infection, or abnormalities 
suggestive of TB will be performed , at screening and at any time during the study if 
TB is suspected. (also see section  3.5). 
 
All samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory, except for ESR that will be measured via the local laboratory, by [CONTACT_441252] .  
 
Except for ESR, CRP, and fibrinogen, laboratory values outside the normal range 
will be flagged and clinical relevance will be assessed by [CONTACT_737]. The 
results of CRP, ESR and fibrinogen tests will not be communicated to the 
investigational sites and CRO/S ponsor (unless in case of an alert for CRP or 
fibrinogen), with the exception of the CRP and fibrinogen results at screening which 
are needed for assessing the subject’s eligibility for randomization.  
If clinical signs and symptoms  are present for which the Investigator need s to 
know values of ESR, CRP or fibrinogen  for medical care,  he can request this 
information .  
 
All clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings will be re corded as AEs in the 
(e)CRF (also see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
 
In the event of unexplained or unexpected clinical laboratory test values, the 
test(s) will be repeated  and followed up until the results have returned to the 
normal range and/or an adequate explanation for the abnormality is found.  
 
During the screening period, s ubjects with an abnormal clinical laboratory value 
(i.e., biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis, fibrinogen, or coagulation) may have 
one laboratory analys is repeated if the I nvestigator considers the result to be 
inconsistent with prior determination and/or not representative of the subject’s 
clinical condition at screening. Only the clinical laboratory test not meeting entry 
criterion should be repeated (n ot the entire panel).

AND REPORTING  
 
3.5.1.  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
AE definitions will be followed as stated in the ”Note for Guida nce on clinical safety 
data management: definitions and standards for expedited reporting” (International 
Conference on Harmonization [ ICH] topic E2A).  
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a 
medicinal (investig ational or non -investigational) product. An AE does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with th e use of a medicinal (investigational or 
non-investigational) product, whether or not considered related to that medicinal 
(investigational or non -investigational) product.  
 This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic 
procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities.  
 
In the differentiating between medical history and AEs, the following points will be 
considered.  
• Conditions that started before sign ing of informed consent and for which no 
symptoms or treatment are present up to the timing of signing of the informed consent are recorded as medical history (e.g., seasonal allergy without acute 
complaints).  
• Conditions that started before signing of info rmed consent and for which 
symptoms or treatment are present after signing of informed consent, but with unchanged severity, are recorded as medical history (e.g., allergic pollinosis).  
• Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed cons ent will be 
documented as AEs.  
 
All AEs will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until 
completion of the subject’s last visit.  
 A TEAE is any AE temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether 
considered related to the st udy drug or not. T EAEs are recorded from the start of 
study drug administration, until completion of the subject’s last visit.  
 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to collect all AEs (both serious and 
non-serious) derived by [CONTACT_19702], unsolicit ed reports of subjects, by [CONTACT_441254]: 25_A0006_14_0140          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

you last?”; “Is there anything new that you wish to discuss?”).  
 
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_566968]. AE 
entry should indicate time of onset and end time and rating of the seriousness (see section  3.5.2), severity (see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), and outcome (see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) of 
the AEs, and relationship to study drug and study procedures (see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), 
action taken regarding study drug (see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), and concomitant therapy 
taken for the AE.  
 
The Investigator will judge upon the severity of the AEs and relation to study drug 
and study procedures.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  AE SEVERITY  
 
The severity of AEs will be rated on a 3-point scale according to the  Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0):  
 • Mild: discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity (signified by 
[CONTACT_479] 1 of CTCAE v4.0) .  
• Moderate: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity (signified 
by [CONTACT_479] 2 of CTCAE v4.0) . 
• Severe: incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activity, (signified by [CONTACT_479] 3 or 4 or 5 of CTCAE v4.0).  
 
It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: a severe AE is not 
necessarily serious.   
 Please refer to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) 
for assessment of severity of laboratory abnormalities.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  OUTCOME  
 
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:  
• Recovered / resolved . 
• Recovering / resolving . 
• Recovered / resolved with sequelae . 
• Not recovered / not resolved . 
• Fatal. 
• Unknown.

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 83/107 [IP_ADDRESS].  RELATION TO STUDY DR UG OR 
STUDY PROCE DURES  
 
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of 
treatment is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the (e)CRF.  
 The assessment is based on the question whether there  was a “reasonable causal 
relationship” to the study treatment in question. Possible answers are:  
• Unlikely/Not related . 
• Possibly related . 
• Related . 
• Not applicable.  
 If the causal relationship to the study treatment is unknown, the answer is defined as “related ”. 
 Note that only AEs starting after administration of study drug can be assigned a 
causal relationship between the AE and study drug administration. For AEs starting 
prior to study drug administration, causal relationship between the AE and study drug should be not applicable.  
 Assessment of causal relationship  of any AE to protocol -required procedures can be 
completed with: • Yes (specify) . 
• No.

following conditions:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening: the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event. It 
does not refer to an event that hypothetically might cause death if it were more 
severe.  
• Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
an AE associated  with a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_566957]: 
- The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours.  
- The admission is pre -planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged 
prior to the start of the study). 
- The admission is not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193899]).  
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_566958] e criterion of “medically important” and as such may be reportable 
as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment. In addition, where local regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation 
takes precedence.  
• Results in  persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s functions.  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is another medically important serious event as judged by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator, or is 
defined as requiring intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the 
definition above (including suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a 
medicinal product should be reported as an SAE). Other examples of such even ts 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Any AE is 
considered an SAE if it is associated wi th clinical signs or symptoms judged by

All serious infections should be reported as SAE.  
 
A treatment -emergent SAE is any SAE temporally associated with the use of study 
drug, whether considered rel ated to the study drug or not.  
 
The Investigator or clinical site personnel should notify the CRO of all SAEs, regardless of relationship to the study drug, within 24  hours of clinical site 
personnel becoming aware of the event (see  Investigator Site File ).

Investigator s all SAEs that are unlisted (unexpected) and associated with the use of 
the drug.  
 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are already present in the European Medicines Agency Eudravigilance 
database do not have to be once again reported to the CA becaus e they have direct 
access to the Eudravigilance database.  
 
The expedited reporting will occur no later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor 
(or the CRO on behalf of the Sponsor) has first knowledge of the adverse reactions.  
 
For fatal or life -threateni ng cases the term will be maximal 7 calendar days for a 
preliminary report with another 8 days for completion of the report.  
 
3.5.4.  REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
AE reporting, including S[LOCATION_003]Rs, will be carried out in accordance with applicable 
local regulations. For reported deaths, the Investigator should supply the Sponsor 
and the IEC/IRB with any additional requested information (e.g., autopsy reports 
and terminal medical reports).  
 
After termination of the clinical study (last subject last visit in the study),  any 
unexpected safety issue that changes the risks benefit analysis and is likely to have an impact on the subjects who have participated in it, will be reported by [CONTACT_441257](ies) concerned together with pr oposed actions.  
 
3.5.5.  FOLLOW -UP OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
AEs will be handled according to common clinical practice. If necessary, in order to 
obtain additional information to ensure safety to the subject, additional blood and urine samples may be taken at the discret ion of the Investigator. Information 
relative to other means of investigational diagnostics used in relation to the AE will also be communicated.  
 
AEs are recorded from signing the ICF until completion of the subject’s last visit . 
TEAEs are recorded from t he start of study drug administration until the subject’s 
last visit .  
 
All AEs occurring at any time during the study (including the follow -up period) will 
be followed until satisfactory  outcome .  
 For subjects that are considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be 
made to obtain information on the final status of the subject.

PARAMETERS  
 
The primary endpoint is the reduction of signs and symptoms of RA evaluated by 
[CONTACT_441258]20 response at Week  12. 
 The following efficacy analyses will be performe d in addition to the primary 
analysis : 
• The proportion of subjects achieving an ACR response of 20, 50 , and 70 over 
time will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
• ACR-N index of improvement over time will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
• The DAS28 ( using CRP and ESR ) score over time will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570].  
• The proportion of subjects with EULAR response over time will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
• The change from baseline (absolute change) in disease activity over time will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The following disease activity scores will be 
used:  
- DAS28 (CRP and ESR)  
- SDAI  
- CDAI 
• The proportion of subjects in remission over time will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The following disease remission definitions will be used:  
- DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6  
- SDAI ≤ 3.3  
- CDAI ≤ 2.8  
- Boolean: TJC ≤1, SJC ≤ 1, CRP ≤1 mg/dL, VASPA ≤1 (on a 0 -10 scale)  
• The change from baseline (absolute change) in HAQ- DI over time will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
• The proportion of HAQ- DI responders (i.e., those who have a clini cally 
meaningful improvement from baseline of ≥ 0.25 [absolute change] in HAQ -DI) 
over time will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
• The proportion of subjects with HAQ- DI ≤ 0.5, defining normal physical function, 
over time will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148] g roup. 
• The proportion of subjects with HAQ- DI ≤ 0.5 (normal physical function) with or 
without remission (DAS28, SDAI, CDAI, and Boolean) at Week 12 will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
• The changes from baseline (absolute change) in the physical and menta l 
component scores of the SF-36 at Week  12 will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490].  Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0140          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

summarized by [CONTACT_1570] . 
• The duration of morning stiffness  at Week 12  will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490] . 
 
Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed according to the ITT 
principle. Summary statistics for continuous efficacy  endpoints include mean (and 
associated 95% confidence interval) , standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum. For categorical efficacy endpoints frequency and proportion or percentage (together with 95% confidence interval) will be calculated. Analysis on 
the primary endpoint  will be repeated for the PP population, as a sensitivity 
analysis.  
 
Subgroup analyses will be performed to evaluate consistency of the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints over covariates including demographics (inclu ding 
weight and region), baseline disease characteristics (including disease duration, RF category and anti CCP category), baseline and prior medications, and site.  
 
Unless specified otherwise, non -responder imputation for missing binary efficacy 
endpoints  will be applied, whereas missing continuous efficacy endpoints will be 
imputed by [CONTACT_441260].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  PRIMARY EFFICACY END POINT  
 The primary efficacy endpoint (ACR20 response at Week 12) will be summarized for 
each treatment group. Differences in response between treatment groups and associated 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 The open -label, joint assessor -blinded segment with TCZ s.c. is not intended to be 
an active comparator but to provide parallel efficacy and safety data f or TCZ in the 
same RA population.  
 Data will be analyzed according to the intent- to-treat principle; thus, subjects will 
be analyzed according to the treatment for which they were assigned. Subjects with missing ACR20 response at Week  12 will be treated as  non-responders (non -
responder imputation approach).  
 
If ACR20 cannot be calculated at Week 12, such  subjects will be conside red to not 
have achieved an ACR 20 response.

PARAMETERS  
 
All PD data will be summarized using descriptive statistics and will be listed and 
summarized in tabular and/or graphical form.  Additional exploratory modelling  
(e.g., predictive analysis of specific bioma rkers) may be performed.  
 
Exposure- response Model (s) 
An Exposure -Response analysis will be performed to determine the relationship 
between ALX -0061 serum exposure and PD and efficacy endpoints , i.e., DAS28 and 
ACR20  using nonlinear mixed effects modelling .  
 
Details on the exposure -response modelling will be included in a separate Data 
Analysis Plan, and will be performed under the responsibility of Ablynx NV. Results of this analysis will be provided in a separate Modelling and Simulation report.  
 
3.6.7.  EVALUATI ON OF SAFETY 
PARAMETERS  
 
The DSMB will periodically evaluate the safety data (see section  3.4.5). 
 The following analyses will be performed  to assess the safety of subjects in this 
study.  
• The incidence and type  of AEs.  
• The incidence and type of SAEs.  
• The incidence and type of related AEs (including study drug injection -site 
reactions and hypersensitivity reactions).  
• The laboratory parameters and change from baseline in these laboratory 
parameters.  
• The incidence of antibodies to ALX -0061.  
 
All safety, PD and immunogenicity analyses will be performed using the Safety 
Population of all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_744799] actually receiv ed.  
 In addition, subgroup analyses will be performed to evaluate consistency of safety 
over covariates including demographics (including weight), and concomitant 
medication (including immunosuppressants and corticosteroids).  
 
AEs will be fully described and coded according to the Medical Dictionary for 
regulatory Activities. A treatment -emergent analysis of AEs will be done. Frequency 
of subject s presenting AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, adverse drug reactions, and Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0140          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 93/107 SAEs will be tabulated for each treatme nt group by [CONTACT_39812].  
 
For laboratory parameters, descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) will be computed on the actual values and the 
change from baseline (absolute ) for each parameter.  All laboratory values will be 
categorized according to their normal ranges as below, within or above normal. A shift table versus baseline  (including final value versus baseline and worst value 
versus baseline)  will be created.  
 Vital signs variables wil l be fully depi[INVESTIGATOR_441218] (for actual 
values and changes from baseline) and shift tables according to their normal ranges. Screening ECG values will be assessed through listing of individual results 
by [CONTACT_513567].  
 
Abnormal findings in physical examinations will be listed.  
 Immunogenicity will be assessed through listing of individual results by [CONTACT_566969].  
 
3.6.8.  DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
 No formal sample size calculations have been made. Assuming ACR20 response 
rates of 40%, 50% , and 50% for  ALX-[ADDRESS_744800] s per arm will 
result in 95% confidence intervals for pairwise difference in ACR20 response rates with half-widths of about 18% . Given these half-widths, it is believed that the 
resulting 95% confidence intervals for pairwise difference in ACR20 response rates 
will provide sufficient information about dose -response to help defin e the optimal 
dose regimen for furth er clinical development.

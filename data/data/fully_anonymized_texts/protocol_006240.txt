Objectives & 
Endpoints:   To investigate the therapeutic potential of cannabid iol (CBD ) as a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_279287].  Rationale : CBD is 
commonly being used as an over -the-counter treatment for arthritis -
related pain, however no clinical trial has been performed to establish 
efficacy.  Hypothesis : CBD is more effect ive than placebo for relieving 
pain and improving patient -reported outcomes for thumb basal joint 
arthritis.   
Study Design : The study design with be a double -blind, randomized 
controlled trial with crossover. Treatment will be blinded to the subjects 
and investigators. Patients will be randomly assigned 2 weeks of the 
CBD or control and then crossover to the other condition for 2 additiona l 
weeks. Patients will apply a novel c ream  containing CBD at the thumb 
base joint twice daily for 1 hour. Subjects will  be advised to observe for 
physiologic changes, skin changes, or other adverse effects.

2  INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Study R ationale   
Arthritis of the thumb basal joint is common, leading to debilitating pain, weakness, and 
instability that severely limits function  (1).  Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non -psychoactive 
hemp derivative with demonstrated efficacy for reducing cancer -related pain; however, 
its role in the treatment of arthritis -related pain has yet to be established.   
2.[ADDRESS_340880] shown the sa fety and efficacy of  topi[INVESTIGATOR_279291] ( 2) and rats ( 3). Topi[INVESTIGATOR_279292] -effects. The dose of maximum absorption and efficacy seen in rats was 
shown to be 6.2 mg/day ( 3). To date, no studies have been performed to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_279293].  

DeGeorge -RCT for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_279283]:  04/27/2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   11 Nitecka -Buchta et al. performed a double -blind randomized controlled trial of topi[INVESTIGATOR_279294] 60 total patients with myofascial pain.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_55594] 67 mg CBD – 
including other minor cannabinoids – was applied to masseter muscles twice daily for 14 
days in the case group.   Visual Analog Scores (VAS) were reduced from 5.6 on Day 0 to 
1.7 on Day 14 (70.2% reduction) in the case group, versus 5.1 on Day 0 and 4.6 on Day 
14 (9.8% reduction) in the control group (p = 0.00). (4)   
 Xu et al. performed a randomized controll ed trial with cross -over for topi[INVESTIGATOR_279295] 29 patients with symptomatic lower extremity neuropathy.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_55594] 250 mg 
of pure CBD (case arm) was applied up to four (4) times daily for four (4) weeks, and then 
patients switched to emu  oil (control arm) with the same application for 4 weeks followed 
by [CONTACT_12783] -over.  They showed a statistically significant reduction in Neuropathic Pain Scale 
scores for intense (5.11 to 4.02) (p=0.009) and sharp (4.01 to 3.09) (p<0.001) pain 
between case a nd control arms. (5)    
 No side effects or adverse events were noted in either clinical trial.  
We have designed a randomized, controlled crossover design clinical trial  to assess the 
safety and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_279296].  
3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
 Known  Potential Risks  
No major side effects were noted from previous topi[INVESTIGATOR_279297]. Minor side effects from 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_279298], diarrhea, fatigue, change in appetite, and 
weight gain/loss ( 3). Exogenous CBD may affect the metabolism of Coumadin and other 
drugs based on the P450 metabolism. Another theoretical risk is contact [CONTACT_8748].  
 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
 A potential benefit of this treatment is the potential pain relief and gain of hand function 
if the CBD  is effective at improving symptoms.  
 
In addition – if the study shows that the administration  of CBD cream  will alleviate 
arthritic symptoms , this would be a cheap and easy treatment that could  be used for 
many patients by [CONTACT_279311] . 
 
There has yet to be a randomized controlled trial demonstrating benefit of topi[INVESTIGATOR_279299] . The risks involved as detailed above are 
mitigated by [CONTACT_279312], which are currently understudied.

DeGeorge -RCT for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_279283]:  04/27/2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   17 Hemp Isolate (CBD) will be used from Eco -X, Inc. ( [ADDRESS_340891] Box 
324, Grand  Junction , CO [ZIP_CODE]). The product is rated for personal care p roducts 
formulations and the product was tested b y Desert Valley Testing .  
 
In the Michael Timko, P hD Laboratory at the University of Virginia, the CBD will be 
mixed to the final desired concentration with USDA  Organic  Shae butter  (Mary Taylor 
Naturals, LLC, [ADDRESS_340892], Fort Myers, FL  [ZIP_CODE] ). The control group will  receive 
USDA Organic  Shae butter only.   
 
Instructions on h ow to apply and remove the creams will be provided and explained to 
subjects. Investigational product will be labeled appropriately for the product to be 
administered for home use. Minimum labeling requirements include  space for subject 
identification (name [CONTACT_279323]), product name/strength/beyond use date, basic 
instructions for use, emergency co ntact information and protocol number. The subjects 
will be instructed to store the cream at room temperature, and to keep the product out of 
reach of children.  
 
Notes: This study is using a plant derived cannabinoid (phytocannabinoid) preparations 
conta ining CBD . Phytocannabinoid preparations unlike chemically -synthesized 
cannabinoids, also contain low levels of non -cannabino id constituents of the Cannabis 
plant that belong to miscellaneous groups of natural products (primarily terpenoids and 
flavonoids). The low levels of these adjuvants in the purified material may contribute to 
the analgesic, as well as the anti -inflammator y effects of Cannabis extracts, but for all 
intents and purpose are below levels that would be considered therapeutically relevant. 
Plant derived CBD is identical chemically to endocannabinoids (present endogenously in 
human or animal tissues) and syntheti c CBD. The majority of all CBD containing 
products on the commercial market are prepared with phytocannabinoid preparations of 
varied purity.  
 
 Product Storage and Stability  
The case and control creams are stored by [CONTACT_279315]. The creams  will be used in the study 
within six (6) months from formulation.  After formulation and packaging in the Timko

participants will be randomized to either the treatment group or placebo group (1:1 ratio) 
once consent is signed and inclusion/exclusion c riteria are satisfied.    All investigators 
and subjects will be blinded. The study coordinator  will have the master randomization 
list.  
 Emergency Unblinding Procedures  
Randomization codes and corresponding treatment assignment will be made available to 
the Primary Investig ator (PI) for emergency use when applicable. If it is not reasonable 
to inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_279302], the study staff must promptly document in the 
subject’s source record and should subsequently contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_279303] o f treatment assignment [ such as accidental unblinding or

medications and supplements .  
8 STUDY CLOSURE, S TUDY INTERVENTION  DISCONTINUATION  AND 
PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION  OR WITHDRAWAL  
8.1 Study Discontinuation and Closure  
 
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or 
termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_91319],  
the Investigational New Drug (IND) sponsor and regulatory authorities.  If the study is 
prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and will provide the reason(s)  for the termination or 
suspension.  Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of 
changes to study visit schedule.  
  
Circumstances that would  warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited 
to 
 
• Determination of une xpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants   
• Demonstration  of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that the primary en dpoint has been met  
• Determination of futility

DeGeorge -RCT for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_279283]:  04/27/2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   19 Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality 
are addressed  by [CONTACT_1201], and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
 
Participants receiving study treatment at the time of study discontinuation should 
complete procedures described in section 8.3. 
 
8.2 Participant Disco ntinuation/Withdrawal  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
A participant’s study treatment would be discontinued for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical 
condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would 
not be in the best interest of the participant  
• Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study intervention  
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not 
previously recognized) that precludes further study participation  
• Participant decision to withdraw fr om study treatment and/or the study . 
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from study treatment will be 
recorded . Participants who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do 
not receive the study intervention may be replaced.  Participants who sign the informed 
consent form, and are randomized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently 
withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study, will not be replaced. 
Participants that withdraw from the study ( not only from study treatment, but all study 
follow -up) will not be contacte d for any further study visits.  
8.[ADDRESS_340895] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_279316] 24 hours  and counsel the participa nt on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will 
make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635].  
• These contact [CONTACT_279317].  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study with a prima ry reason of lost to follow -up.

9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
9.1 Clinical Assessments  
Hand Functional Assessment :  Hand functional assessment will include grip, 
appositional, and oppositional pi[INVESTIGATOR_32261] (kg); Kapandji score; and MP and IP range 
of motion.  Assessments will be performed at B aseline and study Days 7, 14, 21, and 28.  
Patient Reported Outcome Measures : The PROMIS -29 and PROMIS upper extremity 
tests will be collected. The PROMIS -29 is a free publicly available generic HRQoL  
measure consisting of in dices of pain, pain interference, depression, anxiety, global 
function, and social interactions  (Attachment 1, Appendix 14. 4)  Subjects will complete 
the measure  at Baseline and study Days 7, 14, 21, and 28. The PROMIS upper 
extremity test utilizes item -response theory and Computer Adaptive Test to efficiently 
and precisely report patient symptoms and perceived function.  Subjects will complete 
the measure in clinic u sing an iPad . The  PROMIS upper extremity assessment is 
provided in  Attachment 2  (Appendix 14.4) . Subjects will complete the PROMIS 
assessment a t Baseline and study Days 7, 14, 21, and 28.  
 
9.2 Safety Assessments  
Medical History:  Relevant medical history, including history of mental illness, drug or 
substance abuse, history of hemp -based product usage and other pertinent history will be 
recorded in the case report form . 
 
Laboratory Testing:  At baseline and Study Day 35 , blood draws will be performed on 
all subjects at the UVA Medical Laboratory. The following tests will be or dered and 
monitored for clinical abnormalities:  
• CBC  
• Basic metabolic panel (i.e., BUN, creatinine, CO2, Cl, K, Na, and glucose)  
• Hepatic function testing ( i.e., serum transaminases [ALT/AST], total bilirubin, 
and alkaline phosphatase)  
 
• Pregnancy Testing (if applicable) (Screening)  
 
• Urine Pregnancy Test (if applicable) ( Screening and Day 0 before dosing ) 
Daily Skin Monitoring:  Subjects will be asked to obser ve the testing site for physiologic 
changes, skin changes or other adverse events daily. Subjects will be provided with a 
daily diary to record and monitor any observed changes. The daily di ary is provided in 
Appendix 14.3 . They will be instructed to notif y the investigator of any sudden changes 
in skin appearance or increase in their arthritic symptoms that are more than minimally 
tolerated.  
Physician Skin Monitoring:  At baseline and at every subsequent visit, the investigator 
will assess the CBD cream si te for adverse events. A score will be given corresponding to 
the assessment tool below:  
DeGeorge -RCT for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_279283]:  04/27/2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   21  
• NOTE:  Changes in skin appearance will be evaluated using the standardized 
skin assessment tool above.  A patient will be removed from study with a score 
>/= 2.  
 
Clinical Evaluations : Subjects will be monitored weekly for the following : 
• Vital sign assessments (i.e., heart rate and blood pressure)  
• Suicidal behavior and thoughts as a specific question using the Columbia -
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) . The full questionnaire is provided in 
Attachment 3 (Appendix 14.4) .  
o Monitor for somnolence and sedation and advise patients not to drive or 
operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on study 
drug Subjects will be asked if they feel more, less, or no change in their 
level of fatigue during the time they were administering study drug.  
Adverse Event  Monitoring:  Information regarding occurrence of adverse events will be 
captured throughout the study. D uration (start and stop dates and times), severity/grade , 
outcome, treatment and relation to study intervention will be recorded.  
 
10 DATA AND SAFETY MON ITORING PLAN   
10.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event will be considered any undesirable sign, symptom , medical , or 
psychological condition even if the event is not considered to be rela ted to the 
investigational drug/ intervention. Medical condition/diseases present before starting the 
investiga tional drug/intervention will be considered adverse events only if they worsen 
after starting study treatment/intervention.  An adverse event is also any undesirable and 
unintended effect of research occurring in human subjects as a result of the collectio n of 
identifiable private information under the research.  Adverse events also include any 
problems associated with the use of an investigational drug  that adversely affects the 
rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  
 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (S AE) 

DeGeorge -RCT for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_279283]:  04/27/2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   22 An adverse event (AE)  is considered a serious  adverse reaction (SAE) if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death,  
• a life -threatening adverse event,  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850],  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threaten ing, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples  of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 Class ification of an Adverse Event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity of Event  
For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participan t’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily 
equate to “serious”.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Study Intervention  
All AEs must have their  relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_21217]/her clinical 
judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories 
below. In a c linical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, 
and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, 
including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time 
relationship to study intervention administra tion and cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153].  
 
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory te st result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the 
study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other 
DeGeorge -RCT for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_279283]:  04/27/2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   23 drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge).  
 
• Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
(e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial 
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the 
participant’s clinical c ondition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may 
rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring 
more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely 
related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to b e related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a 
causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable 
time after administration  of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or 
chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the 
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
 
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study int ervention 
administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to 
another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by 
[CONTACT_15370].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expectedness  
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_118631].  An 
AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not 
consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention .  
 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during 
study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be 
captured on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes 
event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study 
product (assessed only by [CONTACT_168753] a diagnosis), 
and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition (including a laboratory abnormality) that is present at the time that 
the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. 
However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it 
will be re corded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_17110].

10.2 Unanticipated Problems  
 Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP) considers unanticipated problems 
(UPs)  (may include a data breach) involving risks to participants or others to include, in 
general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
DeGeorge -RCT for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_279283]:  04/27/2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   26 • Unexpected in terms of nature, se verity, or frequency given t he research 
procedure s that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being 
studied;  
• Related or possibly rela ted to participation in the research (“possibly related” 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
[ADDRESS_340897] deviation (SD), as appropriate, and 
absolute and percentage frequen cy. Differences between pre - and post -treatment 
scores (delta scores) will be assessed with the Wilcoxon signed -rank test. Correlations 
between delta score s and the variables considered [ age, gender, body mass ind ex 
(BMI), radiographic features]  will be ev aluated with the Spearman, Mann -Whitney, and 
Kruskal -Wallis tests. The significance threshold will be set at 0.05 . 
 
11.2 Sample Size  Determination  
Based on a 95% confidence interval to show a 50% reduction effect (as shown in the 
literature) and receive 80% pow er with a population variance of 0.25, sample size 
analysis resulted in a sample size of at least 16.  The  UVA Hand Center performed 421 
operative procedures in 2018 for the management of thumb basal joint arthritis among 
our 6 fellowship trained hand  surgeons, and consequently has  a volume sufficient to 
accrue 40 patients during the study period.  
 Randomizati on 
The study participants will be randomized to either the treatment group or placebo  group 
(1:1 ratio) once consent is signed and inclusion/exclusion criteria are satisfied.  
Randomization will be not be stratified .  All investigators and subjects will be blinded.  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_340898] who receives the study drug will be considered Intent to 
Treat (ITT) for safety assessments. All AEs will be assessed for their relatio nship to the 
treatment.  
 
[ADDRESS_340899] for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_279283]:  04/27/[ADDRESS_340900] understands what is being covered in the 
consent form.   Questions might include:   
• Would you summarize for me wha t you believe will be done to you if you 
are in this study?  
• Would you benefit from this study?  
• What do you feel are the risks of being in this study?  
 
Potential subjects will be given an opportunity to ask questions.  Their level of 
understanding will dictate how much time will be spent covering each item .  Once all of 
their questions have been answered, if they decide to participate, they will be asked to 
sign the consent form.  The person obtaining consent will sign the form and subjects will 
be given a copy of the signed consent form. Study procedures will then begin.  The 
informed consent process for each individual subject will be documented in the s ubject’s 
medical record.  
 Confidentiality and Privacy  
Participant confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_279319] . The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other 
information generated will be  held in strict confidence. Consents will be maintained in a 
confidential manner in accordance with the code of federal regulations and HIP AA. No 
information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third 
party without prior wr itten approval .  
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
The study participant’s contact [CONTACT_65246]. At the end of the study, all record s will continue to be kept 
in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_3488],  and 
institutional policies . 
 Safety Oversight  and Monitoring  
 
Any study under the purview of the University of Virginia HSR -IRB is subject to review. 
Studies are chosen for post -approval m onitoring either a) at random or b) requested by a 
study team member or any member of the IRB -HSR.   
 
The purpose of post -approval  monitoring audits is to ensure that documentation of 
clinical research studies is of the highest quality, verify protocol adherence, and ensure 
that all Federal and local rules concerning clinical research are being fulfilled.  Post -
approval monitoring is  done by [CONTACT_279320] -RCT for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_279283]:  04/27/2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   28 (VPR) in accordance with their Standard Operating Procedures. The conduct of an on -
site review may include but is not limited to:  
• requests for progress reports from investigators,  
• examinat ions of research records, including signed informed consent documents, 
protocol modifications, and unexpected, serious, and/or related adverse 
experience reports,  
• contacts with research subjects, or  
• observation of the consent process and/or research proced ures. Examples of 
when observation of the consent process could occur are:  
• Full board IRB determines during review of a project that a conflict of 
interest exists such that the informed consent process should be 
observed by a neutral party;  
• IRB is made awa re of a complaint or concern with regard to the informed 
consent process; or  
• IRB determines as a result of the monitoring process that the consent 
process is insufficient and education/training is required for conduct of 
consent.  
 Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
 
Each clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and 
biological specimen collection, documentation and completion according to institutional 
policies.  
 
The investigational site will provide direct access to a ll trial related sites, source 
data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing and inspection 
by [CONTACT_3482].  
 
12.[ADDRESS_340901]  Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_279306]. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the 
accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
 
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate 
interpretation of data.   
 
Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_279307].  Data recorded in the case 
report form (CRF) derived from source documents should be consistent with the data 
recorded on the source documents.  
 
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse rea ctions 
data) and clinical laboratory data will be entered into Microsoft Excel for data analysis. 
Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.

Study Title: Use of Dsuvia in Patients Undergoing Spi[INVESTIGATOR_807213]:  10/28/2022  
 
Background:  
Dsuvia is a novel drug recently approved by [CONTACT_1622] (201 8) for moderate to severe acute pain. It 
has a unique mode of delivery  as a small sublingual tablet (Figure 1) , and there is evidence to 
suggest it may provide significant benefit to surgical patients with moderate to severe pain. Based 
on published data as well as recently completed studies, there is strong evidence to suggest that DSUVIA 
can decrease other opi[INVESTIGATOR_807214] -acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_807215] , provide better 
pain control, and decrease PACU length of stay  and earlier discharges . 
 
Sufentanil, unlike morphine and hydromorphone,  avoids the issue of active metabolites that can 
lead to prolonged, untoward effects, which can complicate  postoperative care and affect patient 
discharge. A study by [CONTACT_807238]1 found  that sufentanil sublingual tablet ( SST, Disuvia ) [ADDRESS_1114642] 
was a potentially feasible option for  managing moderate -to-severe acute pain in that setting . A 
study by [CONTACT_807239]3 studied adult patients undergoing major surgery in five hospi[INVESTIGATOR_807216]. The authors show ed that the SSTS effectively managed postoperative pain in 
abdominal and orthopedic surgeries. A study by [CONTACT_807240]4,  a randomized, open -label  
 2 noninferiority study that enroll ed patients scheduled for elective major open abdominal or 
orthopedic surgery  assessed the proportion of patients who responded “good” or “excellent” at 
the 48 -hour timepoint on the Patient Global Assessment (PGA48) of method of pain control. The 
results showed that 78.5% vs. 65.6% of patients achieved PGA48 "success" for SSTS vs. IV 
PCA morphine , respectively, demonstrating non -inferiority as well as statistical superiority for 
treatment effect. Patients using SSTS reported more rapid onset of analgesia and patient and 
nurse ease of care and satisfaction scores were higher than IV PCA morphine . Adverse events 
were similar between the 2 groups , and  SSTS had fewer patients experiencing oxygen 
desaturations below 95% compared to IV PCA morphine  Future studies are needed to determine 
patient populations that benefit most from the SSTS, assess the added values versus  
intravenous patient -controlled analgesia, and determine the pharmacoeconomics of the system3. 
 
More recently, a  study by [CONTACT_807241] K et al.[ADDRESS_1114643] prior to induction for shorter surgeries. Patients were 
a combination of inpatient and outpatients (same -day surgery). The data shows an overall 56% decreas e 
in PACU IV morphine milligram equivalents (mean MME ± SE) opi[INVESTIGATOR_807217] (8.1 ± 0.5 to 3.6 ± 0.4; p<0.001) . The PACU Phase 1 discharge 
time also was significantly decreased compared to the control group (80 ± 2 min vs 66 ± 2 min; p<0.001). 
From a safety perspective, [ADDRESS_1114644] between $6 -$8 per minute, therefore the time saved more than pays for the drug and can 
increase efficiency and possibly caseload. The investigator’s conclusion is that DSUVIA is a high 
therapeutic index opi[INVESTIGATOR_807218] 
 3 avoiding opi[INVESTIGATOR_807219] (48.5% of patients in the DSUVIA group vs 
16.6% of patients in the control group), or significantly decreasing the amount of IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_807220].  
 
Another  recent study , by [CONTACT_807242].6 was conducted in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_807221] 30 minutes prior to induction. A total of 47 
patients were in the DSUVIA arm and 81 matched historical controls were compared. This study 
showed a decrease in overall IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_807222] a decreased Phase 1 PACU time.  No 
patients required naloxone for respi[INVESTIGATOR_807223].  
 
Sufentanil is a drug with a rapid onset (15 min) and high potency (30 mg= morphine 5mg) (pka 
= 8.0 and solubility coefficient greater than 2000). It is highly bioavailable and highly lipophilic 
with a high therapeutic opi[INVESTIGATOR_807224] (LD50/ED50). It has a muc h lower Cmax compared with IV 
sufentanil. It reaches 70 % Cmax in 30 minutes, lasting as long as 3 hours. Based on existing 
outcomes data, we hypothesize that there will be a clinically significant difference in spi[INVESTIGATOR_807225].  
 
Purpose:    
In this study we plan to examine the perioperative use of Dsuvia (sufentanil SL ; FDA approval 
2018) in the analgesic regimen for spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477] , one of the most common surgeries performed 
in the US . Patients undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_807226]7. Currently, no data are available for this patient population which 
routinely experiences moderate to severe  acute pain  requiring significant opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] .  We will 
analyze whether Dsuvia (sufentanil SL) is associated with lower pain scores, frequency of rescue 
 4 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] s, lower overall opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], PACU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], and side effects of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (i.e., nausea, vomiting, constipation , respi[INVESTIGATOR_229857] ).  
 
Hypothes es:  
1. The perioperative use of Dsuvia 30 mcg SL in a prospective ly recruited  cohort of patients 
undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_807227] (NRS; primary outcome) than observed in two historical control groups 
that did not receive Dsuvia:  one group that received intraoperative remifentanil infusion 
and one that received intraoperative sufentanil infusion.  
 
2. The perioperative use of Dsuvia (sufentanil SL) will be associated with lower overall 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], lower frequency of rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], lower PACU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_807228], and fewer side effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (i.e., nausea, vomiting, constipation , 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800] ) than observed in two historical control groups of patients 
receiving remifentanil or sufentanil infusions without perioperative Dsuvia .  
 
Methods:  
The study design is a n Observational Longitudinal (OL) study with historical controls . There will 
be 1 prospectively recruited study arm (patients receiving the study drug Dsuvia) and 2 historical 
control arms (one that received a n intraoperative remifentanil infusion and the other that received 
an intraoperative  sufentanil infusion, both without Dsuvia).

Detailed Clinical Protocol  
Preoperative:  
The surgeon will approach the patient and introduce the study and one of the investigators will 
explain the study to the patient. The surgeon will assess subject at their visit. At this visit, the 
surgeons will identify any patients that may benefit from D suvia. The information will be 
provided to one of the investigators. The investigator will subsequently review their eligibility 
and inclusion criteria. If the subject continues to meet all the criteria, the investigator will explain 
the study with the pat ient. Thereafter the patients will be provided the consent forms for their 
review and a 24/[ADDRESS_1114645] information. A co -
investigator will be available to answer  
 8 questions on a 24 hour basis. It will be explained to the patient that they will be permitted to 
withdraw from the study at any time for any reason until their day of surgery. On arrival at the 
preoperative area, the patient will be assigned a code by [CONTACT_54858]. Prior to 
premedication, all patients will be made familiar with the use of numeric rating scale  (NRS): 0-10 
(no pain to the worst pain imaginable) . The baseline NRS  score will be recorded.  All routine 
standard practices for surgery, a nesthesia, and perioperative care will be followed with the 
exception of the study intervention. All patients will be premedicated with midazolam (0.025 -
0.05 mg/kg)  
 
Intraoperative Management:  
The Study arm will receive general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA) . Anesthesia induction will 
be achieved with propofol (1.5 -2.5mg/kg), succinylcholine (1mg/kg), and Fentanyl  (50-100 mcg) 
bolus. Anesthesia maintenance will consist of TIVA (total intravenous anesthesia) with 
continued infusions of propofol (80 -200 mcg/kg/min) and sufentanil (0.2 -0.3mcg/kg/hr). The 
study group will receive Dsuvia [ADDRESS_1114646] , 
timed to occur prior to emergence from anesthesia, and  after the patient is turned supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
Antiemetic prophylaxis will be administered (ondansetron)  per standard practice . The patient 
will then be transferred to the PACU.  
 
Postoperative Management:  
Note that Dsuvia  will be ordered as q1hr prn, meaning that repeat doses must be administered at 
least 1 hr apart  (up to 3 doses can be administered in the PACU) .  
 9 Postoperative pain scores will be recorded by [CONTACT_807243]. This 
will be obtained by [CONTACT_807244] 15 mins up to 2 hours.  
In the PACU, patients will be ordered to receive Dsuvia 30 mcg q1 hr prn for breakthrough pain 
(for NRS > 3) as the 1st line analgesic, with fentanyl as the rescue analgesic if the patient is still 
experiencing pain (NRS >3). The following opi[INVESTIGATOR_807235]:  
 
• 1st line: Dsuvia SL 30mcg (NRS >3). 2nd line: Fentanyl 25 -50mcg (NRS >3)  
• If upon arrival to the PACU the patient is still experiencing pain with NRS >3 but cannot 
yet receive a repeat dose of Dsuvia (because of having received 1st dose in the OR less 
than 1 hour ago), then the patient can receive fentanyl 25 -50mcg prn until eligible to 
receive Dsuvia.  
• If at any time the patient’s NRS >[ADDRESS_1114647] of care 
postoperative pain management orders (ie PO and IV prn analgesia for NRS > 3).  
 
Patients who require additional doses of Dsuvia will be monitored for respi[INVESTIGATOR_807236].  
 
Sample Size/Statistical analysis:  
 [ADDRESS_1114648] 80% 
power at a two sided alpha level of 0.025 (0.05/2 pair -wise comparisons) to detect a minimal 
clinically important difference of [ADDRESS_1114649] 
estimates even if one of the two models (i.e., propensity score model or outcome model) is miss -
specified. The multivariable linear regression models for the outcomes will adjust for the 
following covariates: age, sex, BMI, ASA class, surgical invasiveness tier, reoperation, history of 
anxiety, anxiolytic use, history of depression, and antidepressant use. Analytic weights will be 
based on the inverse of the propensity score, calculated via  logistic regression as the probability 
of being in the Dsuvia group conditional upon the aforementioned covariates included in the 
multivariable outcome model.

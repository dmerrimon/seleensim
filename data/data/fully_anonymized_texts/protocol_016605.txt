A Randomized, Double -blind, Single -dose, Placebo -controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy and 
Safety of AXS -07 (meloxicam and rizatriptan) for the Acute Treatment of Migraine in Adults with 
Inadequate Respons e to Prior Acute Treatments . 
INDICATION  Acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults . 
OBJECTIVES Primary Objective:  
To evaluate the effect of AXS -07 as compared to placebo in the acute treatment of migraine 
headache in adults  as evaluated by [CONTACT_829753] -primary efficacy variables:  1) pain freedom 
at Hour 2 and 2) absence of the most bothersome symptom (MBS; nausea, photophobia, or 
phonophobia) at Hour 2. 
Key Secondary Objectives:  
To assess the effect of AXS -07 on sustained headache pain free dom between Hour 2 and Hour 24. 
Secondary Objectives:  
To assess the effect of AXS -07 on: 
• Percentage of subjects with headache pain relief at Hour 2 . 
• Change from baseline in headache pain relief over time.  
• Percentage of subjects with heada che pain freedom over time.  
• Time to headache pain freedom.  
• Time to headache pain relief.  
• Time to sustained headache freedom through Hour 24.  
• Percentage of subjects able to perform normal activity over time.  
• Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C) score s at Hour 2.  
• Percentage of subjects with absence of MBS over time.  
• Percentage of subjects MBS free over time.  
• Percentage of subjects with headache pain freedom between Hours 2 and 48 (48 -hour 
sustained pain -free).   
• Percentage of subjects with pain relapse, where relapse is defined as the return of headache 
within 48 hours after dosing, for subjects who were pain free at Hour 2.  
• Percentage of subjects using rescue medication.  
• Time to rescue medication.  
• Treatment response based on presence of allodynia , BMI, pain intensity, presence of 
depression, and use of preventive medication . 
STUDY DESIGN  This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 4-arm, parallel group,  single -dose, 
placebo -controlled  trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AXS -07 in subjects with migraine 
attacks . The co-primary efficacy endpoints are the 1) percentage of subjects with headache pain 
freedom  at Hour 2, with headache pain freedom  defined as a reduction in headache severi ty from 
moderate or severe pain to no pain  and 2) absence of the MBS (nausea, photophobia, or 
phonophobia) at Hour 2, with the MBS defined at the onset of migraine, prior to drug administration. 
The k ey secondary endpoint, which will be used to establish c ontribution of the individual 
components of AXS -07 to efficacy , is sustai ned freedom from headache pain between Hour 2 and 
24.

Version Date : January 16, [ADDRESS_1151407] an established diagnosis of 
migraine (history indicating the presence of migraine for at least 1 year) with or without aura as 
defined by [CONTACT_829754] , 3rd Edition (ICHD -3), experience 
an average  of 2 to 8 moderate or severe migraine attacks  per month (no more than 10 migraine days 
per month)  over the past [ADDRESS_1151408] a history of inadequate response to prior acute migraine 
treatments . An i nadequate response is defined as a score of ≤7 on the Migraine Treatment 
Optimization Questionnaire ( m-TOQ- 4), corresponding to moderate or worse response to prior 
treatments over the preceding 4 weeks . 
Subjects who successfully complete the Screening  visit (Visit 1)  and continue to meet all entry 
criteria, will be randomly  assigned at Visit 2 (randomization) to receive, in a 2:2:2 :[ADDRESS_1151409] approximately 12 weeks to complete the study, which consists 
of a 14-day screening period followed by 10 weeks to complete treatment. A follow -up visit (Visit 
3) will occur after treating one attack (to be scheduled as soon as possible but within 1 week after 
dosing), or within 10 weeks after randomization ( Visit 2 ) if the study medication  is not used. 
Treatment and Assessments:  
After randomization, upon the occurrence of the next qualifying migraine attack  (defined as the 
onset of moderate or severe pain intensity ) subjects will take the study medication  (one tablet) . The 
study medication is to be taken orally with wa ter. 
Headache Diary  
Headache pain intensity ( measured by a 4-point  rating scale; none, mild, moderate, or severe), will 
be recorded by [CONTACT_829755], and at 
the following time points after taking study medication: 15, [ADDRESS_1151410] bothersome symptom (nausea, photophobia, 
phonophobia) and assess the presence or absence of each symptom at the  following timepoints : [ADDRESS_1151411] to daily 
activities ( on a 4-point scale) will be recorded  pre-dose and at [ADDRESS_1151412] 2 hours after taking study drug. 
A physical examination will be performed at Screening. Samples for clinical laboratory testing 
(hematology  and chemistry) will be collected at Screening. A urine  pregnancy test will be pe rformed 
at Screening  and randomization (Visit 2). At each visit, vital signs will be assessed and concomitant 
medications will be reviewed.  Adverse events will be assessed following dosing with study drug.

methods to control postoperative pain.  
 
2.2 Background  
 
In 2017, approximately 1 in 3 women (32%) in the US gave birth by [CONTACT_27312].3 More than 80% 
of women take at least one opi[INVESTIGATOR_27256].1 Recent studies show that up to 
75% of women who have a cesarean delivery and fill their opi[INVESTIGATOR_27257]. The majority of women do not dispose of the excess tablets 
appropriately.2,4-6 These unused opi[INVESTIGATOR_27258], non- med ical use, overdose and 
development of chronic dependence.   
Between 2007 and 2016, the rate of pregnancy- as sociated mortality involving opi[INVESTIGATOR_27259] (1.3 to 
4.2 per 100,000), as did the percentage of all pregnancy- associated deaths ( 4% to 10%).[ADDRESS_26362]-surgical pain may lead to chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] 
(defined by [CONTACT_27313] 90 days, which occurs in approximately 3-6% of post- surgical patients).
9,10 1 in 300 
to 1 in 50 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- naïve women in the US will develop a persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_27260] a cesarean 
delivery.1,11 Secondly, surgeons tend to provide more opi[INVESTIGATOR_27261], leading to excess 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_27262] a patient’s possession. As approximately 60% of adults report that they obtained opi[INVESTIGATOR_27263] a friend or relative ,10 decreasing the number of excess opi[INVESTIGATOR_27264].  
Physicians today struggle to balance the need for adequate control of acute pain after surgery with the de
sire to limit opi[INVESTIGATOR_27265], development of dependence and diversion. This had 
led to a search for effective pain control methods with less short and long- term risks than opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
The use of multimodal analgesia to control postoperative pain can decre ase opi[INVESTIGATOR_27266]. Multimodal analgesia protocols typi[INVESTIGATOR_27267]- opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) and 
acetaminophen), with opi[INVESTIGATOR_27268]. Use of local treatments and novel devices remains an under -explored adjunct for postoperative pain control as part of a multimodal 
protocol.  Electrical nerve stimulation represents a promising adjunctive therapy. Originally utiliz ed for chronic 
pain, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation has recently been shown to reduce acute pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_27269], including after total knee arthroplasty and hernia repair.
12,13 TrueRelief is a 
novel FDA- cleared bioelectronic device that delivers high -frequency (20,000 Hz) pulsed direct electrical 
current transcutaneously via stainless steel probes. Efficacy of this technology for pain control after 
cesarean delivery has not been studied, but it may represent an importan t adjunct to improve pain control 
while reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].

• Fetal or neonatal death prior to  randomization 
• Inability to randomize on postoperative day 0  
• Inability to complete all  three  non- invasive bioelectronic treatment  during inpatient stay   as assessed by

5.3 Screen  Failures 
 
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical tri al but are not 
subsequently randomized to the study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements. Minimal information 
includes screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_26368]- operative day 0 to inform them about the 
study. Randomization should occur on postoperative day 0, but not earlier. 
Care providers will be educated about the study via targeted information sessions. It has been found to be 
helpful to provide i n-person informative sessions with specific groups of providers, for example faculty, 
residents and fellows.  
The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center is a large academic medical center with over  5000 deliveries per 
year. Assuming a 30% rate of cesarean delive ries this is approximately 1500 cesarean deliveries per year. 
Not every day has 24/7 coverage; therefore it is conservatively assumed that approximately 4 individuals 
daily  are potentially available to enroll on a weekday. It is expected that the number of  women who meet 
the exclusion criteria will be less than 1 percent. Even if 20% of physicians are reluctant to allow their 
patients to participate (relevant in the setting of private physician deliveries within a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and 60% of 
women refuse consent f or the trial, over 360  women could be enrolled annually. 
We are currently conducting a randomized trial in women undergoing cesarean delivery. The aim of the 
trial is to determine whether an individualized opi[INVESTIGATOR_27279] (IOPP) at discharge a fter 
cesarean delivery is non -inferior to a prescription for a fixed amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_27280].  
Women are randomized after cesarean delivery and research staff has to be present on day of discharge for randomization. Even with these major barriers to recruitment, sites have been able to recruit 
approximately  24 participants/ month. While these barriers do not apply to this trial, this study does 
require a medically trained individual to administer the intervention. Thus the study should conservatively be able to enroll at least 24 participants per month.

Trained clinic research  nurses will apply device three times  after cesarean section before discharge  (at 
least 10-14 hrs apart) for duration of 1 2 minutes  each .  
6.2 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
 
Selection bias is minimized by [CONTACT_27314]. However, adequate concealment of the 
assignment and a clear definition of the point of randomization are also important. Eligible and 
consenting women will be randomized by [CONTACT_27315] a secure internet based 
randomization system. Once the randomization program has been run by [CONTACT_27316], the participant will be considered randomized even if the woman reneges.  
Assignment to device or sham device will be in a 1:1 ratio according to a randomization sequence. The 
simple urn method will be used to generate the randomization sequences because it provides a high 
probability of balance in treatment assignments, it is unpredictable, and it allows an explicit 
randomization analysis to be conducted with relative  ease.37  
Research staff will be responsible for randomization and  for administering  the intervention or sham 
device. Clinicians will be blinded to the patient’s group assignment.   
 
6.3 Concomitant  Therapy  
 
Medications for postoperative pain management will be at the discretion of the clinical team. Our 
institution uses standardized postoper ative medication order sets that include oxycodone, acetaminophen 
and/or ibuprofen.  
 
6.4 Discontinuation of Study  Intervention  
 
Since the intervention is a treatment with device during inpatient stay, participants may choose to not 
continue with intervention. Women will be followed through 6 weeks postpartum  regardless of their 
treatment assignmen t.

 7. Study Assessments and  Procedures  
7.1 Study Assessments  
 
7.1.1 Screening &  Randomization 
All women with a cesarean delivery will be screened for eligibility. If appropriate, study personnel will 
invite the patient to serve as a study particip ant. The initial approach will occur pre -operatively or on 
post- operative day 0 to ensure individual care is not modified as a result of the study design prior to 
randomization. Study personnel will describe the study in detail and review the study protocol with the participant. Women agreeing to participate will sign the consent form.  
7.1.2 Baseline  Procedures  
If the patient is eligible and signs the co nsent form, participants be randomiz ed to 
TrueRelief device or identical appearing sham device : 
In addition to information collected for eligibility, the following information will be obtained from an 
interview with the participant and/or through the electronic medical record:  
• Demographic factors (e.g., maternal date of birth, age, BMI, race/ethnicity, education, 
employment status, marital status, household income,  insurance) 
• Factors related to persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_27286], history of mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety), use of anti- depressants or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], chronic pain conditions 
(e.g., back pain, migraines, fibromyalgia).

 Medical history including obstetrical outcomes from the current delivery (e.g., indication for 
cesarean, repeat cesarean, labor prior to cesarean, operative time, type of anesthesia, peri- 
operative complications, gestational age, birth weight, neonatal  outcomes). 
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787]- opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen) use post cesarean through 
discharge  
7.1.3 Follow- up 
Participants will be followed through  6 weeks postpartum.  
 
 
7.2 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
7.2.1 Definition of Adverse Events  (AE) 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not the event is considered drug related.  
Events should be reported also if they are unexpected in nature, severity, frequency, or fit the single IR B 
definition of adverse event. The unexpected nature of the event is determined based on the research procedures and the characteristics of the subject population being studied. If the event is not one that is 
usually seen in this context or reported in the principal investigator / participant brochure, it should be 
considered unexpected. 
7.2.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  (SAE) 
A serious adverse event is one of the following that occurs in the mother, neonate, or infant through 90 
days postpartum:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  event  
• Inpatient re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  conduct 
normal life  functions 
• Other important medical event may meet the definition of serious  if it jeopardizes the  participant  
7.2.3 Classification of an Adverse Event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Study Intervention 
All adverse events must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_27317]/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event occurs in a plausible time relationship to 
study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_27318] # 2022H0046  Version  2.0 
2022  
13  
 chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (dechallenge) should be 
clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with 
use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this  definition. 
• Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE m ay rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it 
can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate. 
• Unlikely – A clinical event whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expe
 ctedness 
The Center PI, or designee will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event is expected or 
unexpected. An adverse event will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_26370] be entered into the adverse 
events database within 24 hours of being notified, but no later than 72 hours from the onset of the event if it occurs prior to delivery discharge. If a death is reported, a copy of the  
ELECTRON  
Protocol # 2022H0046  Version  2.0 
2022  
14  
 participant’s de-i dentified medical record will be uploaded to the adverse events database. Other serious 
adverse events must be entered into the study database within 7 days of being notified. 
Serious adverse events are reviewed in real- time by [CONTACT_976].  
7.2.7 Reporting Events to  Participants  
Participants will not be informed about adverse events, serious adverse events, or study- related results 
unless the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27287]. As noted in Section 7.2, an 
Edinburgh depression score of 13 or higher, or a value other than ‘never’ on the Edinburgh question 10 
(harming oneself), will be reported to the participant and the clinical provider. 
 
7.3 Unanticipated  Problems  
 
7.3.1 Definition of Unanticipated Problems  (UAP)  
An investigator may not initiate a change in research activity without single IRB approval unless the 
change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects, in which case it should be reported to the single IRB as an unanticipated prob lem (UAP).  
The Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) and the single IRB defines an unanticipated problem 
as an event that:  
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the research procedures and the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and 
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and 
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
7.3.2 Unanticipated Problem  Reporting  
For an event that a PI [INVESTIGATOR_27288], the AE should be entered into the database within the timeframes established above.  
In addition, regardless of whether the UAP is an adverse event or not, a report should be emailed by [CONTACT_1600]. The email should contain the following information: 
• Protocol identifying information 
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents a UAP  
• A description of any corrective actions that are proposed in response to the UAP  
Potential unanticipated problems will be reviewed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_27289]. UAP reports should be submitted through the online IRB system no later than 2 weeks (10 business days) from the notif ication.

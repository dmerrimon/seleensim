 CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Study in Patients with Chorioretinal Vascular Disease to Evaluate an 
Aflibercept (EYLEA®) Prefilled Syringe  
Site Locations  Approximately 2 sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  
Objectives  The primary objective of the study is to determine if the prefilled syringe 
(PFS) can be used effectively and safely by [CONTACT_757935] 2  mg dose of aflibercept.  
The secondary objective of the study is to assess ocular safety in the study 
eye. 
Study Design  This is a phase 4, single -arm (2-cohort) , open -label study in patients with 
chorioretinal vascular disease (neovascular age -related macular 
degeneration [AMD], dia betic macular edema [DME], retinal vein occlusion 
[RVO], and diabetic retinopathy [DR] in patients with DME) to evaluate 
handling of the aflibercept PFS.  The study consists of a screening period, a 
single aflibercept treatment, and a follow -up period.   The initial 35 patients 
will now be referred to as cohort 1, and the additional 35 patients will be 
called cohort  2. 
After providing informed consent, patients will be assessed for study 
eligibility at the screening visit, up to 2 weeks before the day 1/baseline visit.  
Screening and the day 1/baseline visit can occur on the same day.  Only 
1 eye will be selected as the study eye.  
At the day 1/baseline visit, patients will undergo safety assessments, and 
will then receive a single dose of study drug, pr epared (retina specialist 
and/or technician) and administered with the PFS by a retina specialist.  
There is a follow -up period of 28 days with a window of -7 days to +14  days, 
during which patients will be evaluated for safety (ocular adverse events 
[AEs] and all [ocular and non -ocular] serious adverse events [SAEs]).  
Study Duration  The duration of the study for a patient is approximately [ADDRESS_1037475] patient.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  Approximately 70 patients will be enrolled, 35 patients in each of 2  cohorts, 
at approximately 2 sites in the US.  
 Target Population:  The study population will include men or women with treatment -naïve or 
previously -treated neovascular AMD, DME, RVO, or DR with DME, in 
whom treatment with aflibercept is indicated.  
                                        VV-RIM-00107449-1.0 Approved - 01 May 2020 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  Treatment(s)   
 Study Drug  
 Dose/Route/Schedule:  The drug product is supplied as a sterile aqueous solution for injection in a 
PFS.  The PFSs are single -use 1  mL glass syringes with a luer connection 
for the needle, and are provided in sealed blister packs.  
Each single -dose PFS provides a usable amount to deliver a single dose of 
2 mg aflibercept in a volume of 50 μL, via intravitreal (IVT) inje ction.  The 
PFS utilized in this study is fully representative of the presentation intended 
for commercialization.  Only 1  eye will be selected as the study eye  
Patients receive a single dose of aflibercept, prepared and administered with 
the PFS, at the d ay 1/baseline visit.  
Endpoints   
 Primary:  The primary endpoint in the study is the number of aflibercept injections 
successfully administered utilizing the PFS.  
 Secondary:  The secondary endpoint is the ocular safety of aflibercept delivered in the 
PFS.   Safety will be measured by [CONTACT_757936].  
Procedures and Assessments  Ocular safety procedures will include Best Corrected Visual Acuity 
(BCVA) scale, using the 4 -meter Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy 
Study (ETDRS), intraocular pressure (IOP), slit lamp examination, indirect 
ophthalmoscopy, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD -
OCT).  
Overall safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_757937], 
and all (ocular and non -ocular) SA Es. 
Statistical Plan  The sample size of approximately 35 patients per cohort for this study is 
based on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advice, and is not 
determined from power analysis.  
The safety analysis set (SAF) includes all enrolled patients w ho received 
any study drug, and it will be used for all study analyses.  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the following 
information:  the number of patients reflected in the calculation (n), mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical or 
ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displayed for each 
category.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
The efficacy and safety of intravitreal (IVT) aflibercept has been well characterized across multiple 
indications in numerous clinical trials.  Marketing authorizations have been granted for aflibercept 
(EYLEA®, [aflibercept] injection), in over 108  countries for the treatment of patients with 
neovascular “wet” age -related macular degeneration (AMD) including the [LOCATION_002] (US), 
countries in the European Union (EU), Japan, and Australia.  Intravitreal aflibercept injection is 
also approved for the treatment of patients with macular edema following central retinal vein 
occlusion (CRVO) in over 104  countries, macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion 
(BRVO) in over 98  countries, diabetic macular edema (DME) in over  103 countries, and myopic 
choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in over 95 countries.  In addition to neovascular AMD, 
DME, and retinal vein occlusion (RVO), aflibercept is also approved in the US for the treatment 
of diabetic retinopathy (DR).  
Currently, a flibercept is available as a sterile aqueous solution for injection in single -use, glass 
vials.  Each vial provides a usable amount to deliver a single dose of 2 mg aflibercept in a volume 
of 50  μL.  This configuration requires withdrawal of aflibercept us ing a 19 -gauge × 1½ -inch, 5  μM, 
filter needle into a 1 mL syringe.  Prior to injection the filter needle is replaced with 30 -gauge × 
½-inch injection needle.  These steps are performed using aseptic technique.  
To minimize the number of manipulations requir ed to prepare the injection, Regeneron has 
developed a single -use 1 mL glass prefilled syringe (PFS).  Each single -dose, PFS provides a 
usable amount to deliver a single dose of [ADDRESS_1037480] 30  patients in each of 2 cohorts utilizing each of the proposed commercial 
aflibercept PFS configurations will be conduc ted.

 CONFIDENTIAL  3.2. Rationale for Dose Selection  
The dose proposed for this study is the 2 mg dose of aflibercept approved by [CONTACT_33438] (FDA) for the treatment of neovascular AMD, RVO, DME, and DR in patients 
with DME.  
3.3. Risk -Benefit  
3.3.1.  COVID -19 Pandemi c 
Recognizing that “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic will have an impact on the 
conduct of clinical trials, the Sponsor does not intend to screen any patient in this study in a specific 
location or area until the COVID -19 pandemic is controlle d and such that patients can safely 
participate in the study.   Until then, the Sponsor plans to continue to obtain approvals from Health 
Authorities/Ethics Committees (ECs) to enable initiation of study sites for this study, as allowed 
by [CONTACT_757938].  
4. STUDY VARIABLES  
4.1. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics will include standard demography (eg, age, race, weight, height, etc), 
disease characteristics including medical and ocular history, and medication history for eac h 
patient.  
4.2. Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
4.2.1.  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint in the study is the number of aflibercept injections successfully administered 
utilizing the PFS.  
4.2.2.  Secondary Endpoint  
The secondary endpoint in the study is the ocular safety o f aflibercept delivered in the PFS.  Safety 
will be measured by [CONTACT_757939] (AEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) in the study eye, through day 29.  
5. STUDY DESIGN  
5.1. Study Description and Duration  
This is a phase 4, single2 -arm (2-cohort) , open -label study in patients with chorioretinal vascular 
disease (neovascular AMD, DME, RVO, and DR in patients with DME) to evaluate use of the 
aflibercept PFS.  The study consists of a screening period, a single aflibercept treatment, and a 
follow -up period through day 29.   The initial 35 patients will now be referred to as  cohort  1, and 
the additional 35 patients will be called cohort  2.

9. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, REPORTING, AND MONIT ORING  
9.1. Obligations of Investigator  
The investigator must promptly report to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) all unanticipated 
problems involving risks to patients, according to local regulations.  This may include death from 
any cause and all SAEs related to t he use of the study drug. It is recommended that all SAEs be 
reported to the IRB, according to local regulations.  
9.2. Obligations of Sponsor  
During the course of the study, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are 
both unexpected and at  least reasonably related to the study drug (suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction [S[LOCATION_003]R]), to the health authorities, IRBs as appropriate, and to the investigators.  
Any AE not listed as an expected event in the Reference Safety Information secti on of the 
Investigator’s Brochure will be considered as unexpected. Any worsening of or new onset of 
symptoms related to (add underlying condition intended to be studied) which occur during the 
screening/washout period prior to study drug administration wi ll be considered expected.  
In addition, the sponsor will report in all other SAEs to the health authorities, according to local 
regulations.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the tria l in the clinical study report to health authorities and IRBs as appropriate.  
                                        VV-RIM-00107449-1.0 Approved - 01 May 2020 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1037490] a causal relationship with the study drug.  Th erefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
An AE also includes any wor sening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
9.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
 Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death  at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] .  In-
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_712364] n to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101803] 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_757934], or is prolonged due to 
the development of a new AE as deter mined by [CONTACT_31598].  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for Serious Sight -Threatening Ocular Adverse Events  
Criteria for serious s ight-threatening ocular AEs include the following:  
 Substantial, unexplained vision loss, or an AE that causes substantial vision loss.  
 An AE that requires either surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent loss 
of vision.  
Criteria for reporting S AEs must be followed for these events.  See Section  9.4 for more 
information on recording and reporting SAEs.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all ocular study eye AEs and any SAEs (ocular and 
systemic) that occur from the time the informed consent is signed until the end of study.  Refer to 
the study reference manual for the procedures to  be followed.  
Information on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  9.4.[ADDRESS_1037491] be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_1037492] reports may 
also be requested.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient completes the study, the 
following will apply:  
 SAE with an on set within 30 days of the end of study or early termination visit - the 
SAE will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to 
obtain follow -up information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic 
and/or stable.  
 SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of study/early termination 
visit - only fatal SAEs and those deemed by [CONTACT_50460] -related SAEs 
will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.  
9.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24  hours of  learning 
of the event:  
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:  Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2  times 
the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if 
associated with an AE,  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not consid ered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within [ADDRESS_1037493] dose of study drug.  Any complication of pregnancy 
affecting a female study patient or female partner of a male study patient, and/or 
fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE.  
Outcome for all p regnancies should be reported to the sponsor.

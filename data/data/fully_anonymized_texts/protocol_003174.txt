 8 1. INTRODUCTION  
Although this protocol contains sufficient information regarding the medications utilized in this 
clinical trial, for additional information please refer to the Investigator’s Brochures for 
lenalidomide and obinutuzumab, Appendix A and B, for detailed information concerning the 
available pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event ( AE) 
profiles.  
1.1 DIFFUSE LARGE B -CELL LYMPHOMA  
Diffuse large B -cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is a distinct histological type within mature B -cell non-
Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL) that is characterized by [CONTACT_210830]. This type accounts for approximately 31% of all newly diagnosed malignant 
lymphomas. (1) 
 
CHOP chemotherapy in combination with the anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab on a 
21-day schedule is a standard of care in newly diagnosed cases in most countries 
worldwide. (2-4) In the GELA study of R -CHOP versus CHOP front line therapy in elderly 
subjects, following R -CHOP treatment the 5 -year event -free survival (EFS) was 47%, the 5 -
year progression free survival (PFS) was 54%, and the 5 -year overa ll survival (OS) was 
58%. (5) While approximately 50% to 60% of patients are cured, for those patients who are 
refractory or who progress following R -CHOP, treatment options are limited and outlook is 
poor; most die within the next two years. Since roughly 40% to 50% of patients are not cured 
on initial therapy, evaluating other front line treatment options is warranted. Other attempts to 
improve cure rate, including R -ACVBD, CHOEP, dose dense regimens (R -CHOP14), and high 
dose regimens (DA -EPOCH), have not replaced R -CHOP21 as a standard of care. (4) 
1.2 PET/CT SCANS IN LYMPHOMA  
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) scans are used in NHL to 
evaluate residual masses detected on CT after completion of chemotherapy, with the negative 
predictive values for outcome of 80% to 100%. (6, 7) Results from a FDG PET  scan after one 
cycle of chemothera py were essentially equivalent to results from a FDG PET  scan obtained at 
the completion of chemotherapy in predicting PFS in NHL and HD. (8)  
Moskowitz et al evaluated  the predictive value of an FDG PET in patients with high risk 
untreated DLBCL after 3 cycles of conventional chemotherapy. (9) Of the 38 patients with a 
positive interim FDG PET, only 5 (13%) had biopsy -confirmed persistent disease. Interestingly, 
the patients with positive interim FDG PET and negative biopsy had no significant difference in 
long-term outc omes from patients with negative interim FDG PET (p=0.27). As a result of this 
important trial, the positive predictive value of an interim FDG PET is considered low enough 
that a biopsy for confirmation is mandatory prior to altering the treatment plan. E ssentially, 
interim FDG PET scans have an excellent negative predictive value, however the positive 
predictive value is not clinically viable.

Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 9 1.3 NON -IMAGING BASED DISEASE MONITORING  
A novel technology (LymphoSIGHT, Sequenta) has been shown to allow a detecti on of a 
tumor -specific clonotype (DoC) in blood and to correlate with therapeutic response and 
identification of relapse prior to imaging findings. (10-12) This novel technology amplifies the 
immunoglobulin (Ig) gene segments from tumor biopsy DNA , and subsequent quantification of 
the same clonotyp e in blood. Genomic DNA  from tumor is  isolated using standard kits from  
Qiagen , and is subsequently amplified using locus -specific primer sets for all known alleles of 
germine line immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and T-cell receptor ( TCR) sequences. (10) The 
tumor -specific  sequences identified at diagnosis are then  used as a target to assess the 
presence of tumor -specific clonotype  in follow -up samples. For quantitation, multiple 
sequencing reads  (~10X coverage)  are gene rated for each rearranged B cell in the reaction.  
 
To determine the absolute measure of the tumor -specific clonotype present in the follow -up 
sample, a known quantity of reference IgH sequence is added into the reaction and the 
associated sequencing reads  are counted. The resulting number of reference IgH reads  per 
sequence are then applied to the tumor -specific clonotype  reads to obtain an absolute 
measure of the total tumor -specific clonotype  in the reaction.  
 
The tumor -specific clonotyp e reads and the absolute number of total leukoctyes in the reaction  
metrics can be  combined to calculate a final tumor -specific clonotype measurement, which is 
the number of tumor -specific clonotype reads divided by [CONTACT_210831].  
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_251892] disease subtypes. (13) The authors successfully classified DLBCL by [CONTACT_158086] (GEP) into the germinal center B -cell (GCB) and the activated B cell (ABC) 
types, deriv ed from their putative cells of origin (COO). Subsequently, an additional type was 
noted by [CONTACT_210832], (14) which has since been renamed as unclassifiable type. 
Although GEP is fully capable of discerning all three types, GCB, ABC, and uncla ssifiable; 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) is capable of discerning only two, GCB and non -GCB, via the 
algorithm described by [INVESTIGATOR_114520]. (15) The less precise, though widely utilized, IHC method groups 
ABC and unclassifiable together as the non -GCB type. The Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular 
Profiling Project reported approximately 60% GCB and 40% non -GCB (including ABC and 
unclassifiable) in [ADDRESS_251893] biopsy samples examined by [CONTACT_187024]. (14, 
16, 17)  
 
The different DLBCL types have been reported to have distinct clinical outcomes with 
CHOP (14) and R -CHOP (17) therapy, further supporting that these are distinct clinical and 
molecular subtypes. With frontline CHOP therapy, the 5 -year OS rates for the GCB, 
Protocol 2015 -0069  
  Version 1.4 April 5, 2018  
 
 
Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 10 unclassifiable, and ABC types were 60%, 39%, and 35%, respectively. (14) With frontline R -
CHOP therapy, the 3 -year EFS for GCB and non -GCB subtypes was 67% and 52% 
respectively, and the 3 -year OS was 85% and 69%, respectively. (17) With RCHOP therapy for 
predominantly higher risk patients ( International Prognosti c Index, IPI 0/1 = 21%, IPI 2/3 = 
63%, and IPI 4/5 = 15%) the median PFS for the ABC type was only 1.5 years. (18, 19) In the 
relapsed setting, the prognosis for the COO subtype appears to be approximately equal, (20, 
21) which may reflect the selection of GCB subjects with adverse biology not cured initially by 
R-CHOP.  
 
1.4.[ADDRESS_251894] selection in 
clinical trials due to the fresh biopsy sample requirement, technological expertise, and 
bioinformatics required to perform and interpret the assay.  
 
This protocol will utilize a validated GEP based assay performed on NanoS tring’s nCounter® 
Analysis System with formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) biopsy material to identify 
eligible subjects with the required ABC type. The NanoString [ADDRESS_251895] the original COO model def ined by [CONTACT_210833] (18) using an 
independent cohort of 68 FFPE biopsies. In the validation cohort the assay was highly 
accurate, as only one case with definitive COO was incorrectly assigned by [CONTACT_124442]; and 
robust, with >95% concordance of COO determination between two independent 
laboratories. (22) 
 
1.5 BIOMARKERS IN DLBCL  
1.5.1  Biomarkers in DLBCL Pathogenesis  
In recent years a number of chromosomal rearrangements, acquired mutations, or aberrant 
expression of genes) have been identified in DLBCL. Many are associated with a particular 
DLBCL COO subtype or yield prognostic information. As an example, BCL2 is a commonly 
translocated or mutat ed gene in the GCB subtype, and EZH2 is also mutated in the GCB 
subtype. (23, 24) Activation of NF -κB is critical for the ABC subtype survival, and mutation of 
MYD88 is more common in the ABC type). (25, 26) Coexpression of MYC/BCL2 as defined by 
[CONTACT_210834] a very aggressive clinical course in both subtypes, although it 
has been report ed to be more common in the ABC type. (27-30) Additionally, mutations in 
MYC, CDKN2A, SOCS1, MYD88, CARD11, TP53, and other genes have demonstrated 
prognostic information in patients with DLBCL receiving front line treatment. (31-34) Single 
nucle otide polymorphisms (SNPs) are also reported to be associated with prognosis in DLBCL 
patients. (35, 36)

 11 1.5.2  Minimal Residual Disease and Clonal Heterogeneity  
In order to be able to adapt treatment intensity, extend duration of response, and prolong PFS, 
more sensitive clinical assessment methods are necessary to better define treatment 
outcomes at the molecular level. Recently, investigators from the National Cancer Institute 
evaluated samples from untreated DLBCL patients treated with DA -EPOCH +/ - rituximab to 
assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) using a next generation s equencing (NGS) based 
test with DNA present in the tumor biopsy and serum. (10) IgH variable, diversity, and joining 
segments as well as immunoglobulin light chain gene segments from genomic DNA were 
sequenced, and analysis of these data demonstrated that NGS MRD measurement detected 
relapse of DLBCL a median of 7.[ADDRESS_251896] scan. (37) 
 
This study will evaluate the ability of NGS sequencing to assess MRD status compared to CT 
scan in a larger sample size to help determine quality of treatment and detection of rela pse. 
The MRD and clonality assessments will be conducted according to the laboratory manual.  
 
1.5.[ADDRESS_251897] 
that in tumor cells and T cells, cereblon, a component of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, is a 
critical target for binding by [CONTACT_210835]. (38-40) These and other studies show ed that the 
loss of cereblon or a binding partner, such as DDB1, decreases or eliminates the antitumor 
and immunomodulatory activity of lenalidomide and pomalidomide. A number of recent studies 
have reported a correlation between pre -treatment levels of ce reblon measured by [CONTACT_210836], 
pomalidomide or thalidomide. In addition, multiple groups have described Aiolos (IKZF3) and 
Ikaros (IKZF1) as two direct substrates of  the CRL4 CRBN E3 ligase complex. These proteins 
act as transcriptional repressors in T -cells and are also drivers of proliferation in multiple 
myeloma (MM) cells. (41)  
 
This study will explore the functions of Aiolos and Ikaros by [CONTACT_210837], as well as 
genetic mutations that could have functional consequences. Validated assays for bo th GEP 
and IHC methods will be used to measure baseline and treatment levels of cereblon, Aiolos 
and Ikaros to investigate whether there is any potential correlation between their expression 
level and clinical outcome. Additional biomarkers may be included  in the analysis based on 
accumulated evidence for their  inclusion.  
 
Mechanistic biomarker measurements for cereblon and other potential biomarkers, including 
substrates of the CRL4 -CRBN complex, gene expression, DNA mutational analysis, and 
metabolic fact ors, will be performed as appropriate. The mechanistic biomarker assessments 
will be conducted according to the laboratory manual.

1.6 LENALIDOMIDE  
REVLIMID®  (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent with anti -
angiogenic properties . Lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion -
dependent anemia due to low - or Intermediate -1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes  (MDS)  
associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic 
abno rmalities.  Revlimid® is also approved in combination with dexamethasone for the 
treatment of patients with multiple myeloma that have received at least one prior therapy.  
 
Lenalidomide, an oral agent, is a thalidomide derivative that belongs to a new cla ss of agents 
known as immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). Lenalidomide has clinical activity in non -
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and has been shown to possess several immunomodulatory 
properties. In addition to its known effect on various cytokines, lenalidomide m ay affect the 
immune cellular component of the tumor microenvironment. Potential effects include inducing 
lymphocyte proliferation, increasing the production of IL -2/INF -g by [CONTACT_210838].  
 
The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 3 -(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3 -dihydro -2H-isoindol -2-yl) pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510] -2, 6-dione 
and it has the following chemical structure:  
Figure 1 Chemical Structure of Lenalidomide  
 
The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193038] C13H13N3O3, and the gram molecul ar weig ht is 
259.3. Lenalidomide is an off-white to pale -yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic 
solvent/water mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble in 
organic solvents and low pH solutions. Solubility was significantl y lower in less acidic buffers, 
ranging from about 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can 
exist as the optically active forms S( -) and R(+), and is produced as a racemic mixture with a 
net optical rotation of zero.  
 
1.6.[ADDRESS_251898] on 
GCB cells .(42) The synthetically lethal effect was associated with down -regulation of interferon 
regulatory factor 4 (IRF4, also known as MUM1), a hallmark of ABC cells. (43) IRF4 inhibition 
by [CONTACT_210839] -regulation of B -cell receptor (BCR) -dependent NF -κB, and this 
effect was reported to require co -expression of cereblon, a molecular target of lenalidomide. It 
has also been reported that NF -κB mediates resistance to chemotherapy and that decreased 
NF-κB expression may restore sensitivity to chemotherapy and targeted agents. (44, 45) The 
ability of lenalidomide to kill ABC DLBCL cell lines by [CONTACT_210840] 
(IFN-ß) production is dependen t on oncogenic MYD88 mutations. (42) In a cereblon -dependent 
fashion, lenalidomide downregulated IRF4 and SPIB transcription factors which repress IFN -ß 
production.  
 
In addition to affecting lymphoma cells directly, lenalidomide exerts potent im munomodulatory 
activity  and thus modulates immune responses. Preclinical studies have shown an 
enhancement of antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity and antitumor effects in vivo 
when lenalidomide was combined with rituximab. (46-48) In a murine NHL model, lenalidomide 
induced a significant increase in the recruitment of NK cells to tumor sites, resulting in 
enhanced antitumor activity of rituximab. (49) When combined with rituximab, lenalidomide 
improved survival in a mouse NHL model and the a ntitumor activity was shown to be NK cell -
mediated. (50)  
 
Lenalidomide reverses immunosuppression of T cells by [CONTACT_210841], chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) , and follicular lymphoma (FL). (51-53) Impaired T -cell 
immunological synapse formation has been reported i n CLL , FL and DLBCL patients and is 
thought to be a mechanism of cancer immune evasion.  Lenal idomide increases expression of 
T cell co -stimulatory molecules, T cell activating cytokines, and the number of cytotoxic T cells 
in MM patient samples. In indolent lymphomas including FL, we found that R -lenalidomide 
activated many different immune ce ll subsets, including T  and natural killer cells, and 
enhanced tumor infiltration by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells .(54, 55) Lenalidomide treatment of the T -cells and 
the tumor cells collected from these patients repaired the immune synapse defects by 
[CONTACT_210842] F -actin synapse. In vitro studies have shown that lenalidomide induced 
actin cytoskeleton reorganization and polarization of NHL cells as early as 30 minutes, a 
process termed “cappi[INVESTIGATOR_007],” which is considered an important subcellular compo nent of the 
immune synapse formation. (56)  
 
Additionally it has been shown that the combined use of lenalidomide and rituximab enhances 
NK cell -mediated immune synapse formation and the resultant cytotoxicity, versus using each 
agent alone. (56) Lenalidomide induces CD20 -localization within the “cap,” and the addition of 
Protocol [ADDRESS_251899] a similar mechanism of potential synergy.  
 
1.6.2  Lenalidomide Clinical Pharmacolog y: 
Mechanism of Action:  
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. Lenalidomide 
possesses immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  Lenalidomide inhibited the 
secretion of pro -inflammatory cytokines and increased the  secretion of anti -inflammatory 
cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation 
with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but not all cell lines.  Of cell lines tested, 
lenalidomide was effective in inhibiting  growth of Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma cell 
line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) but was much less effective in inhibiting growth of 
KG-1 cells (human myeloblastic cell line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and other 
cell lines wi thout chromosome 5 deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited the expression of 
cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2) but not COX -1 in vitro.   
 
Metabolism and Excretion  
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy volunteers, 
approximately two-thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through urinary excretion. 
The process exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is partially or entirely active.  
Half life of elimination is approximately 3 hours.  
 
1.6.3  Lenalidomide Pharmacokinet ics and Drug Metabolism:  
 Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_210801] 0.[ADDRESS_251900] -dose. Co 
administration with food does not alter the extent of a bsorption area under the concentrated 
time curve (AUC) but does reduce the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The 
pharmacokinetic  (PK) disposition of lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC increase 
proportionately with increases in dose. Multiple do sing at the recommended dose -regimen 
does not result in drug accumulation.  
 
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients treated in the 
phase I studies.  Absorption was found to be rapid on both Day 1 and Day 28 with time to 
maxi mum blood levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels (5mg, 10mg, 25mg, and 
50mg).  No plasma accumulation was observed with multiple daily dosing.  Plasma

 15 lenalidomide declined in a monophasic manner with elimination half -life ranging from 2.8  to 6.1 
hours on both Day 1 and 28 at all 4 doses.  Peak and overall plasma concentrations were dose 
proportional over the dosing range of 5mg to 50mg (5).  Exposure (AUC) in multiple myeloma 
patients is 57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.  
 
Multip le dosing at the recommended dose -regimen does not result in drug accumulation. 
Pharmacokinetic sampling in MDS patients was not performed. In multiple myeloma patients 
maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0.[ADDRESS_251901] -dose both on Days  
1 and 28. AUC and Cmax values increase proportionally with dose following single and 
multiple doses. Exposure (AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy 
male volunteers.  
 
Distribution:  
In vitro (14C) -lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%.  
 
Metabolism and Excretion:  
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy volunteers, 
approximately two -thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through urinary excretion. 
The process  exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is partially or entirely active. 
Half-life of elimination is approximately 3 hours.  
 
1.6.4  Clinical Efficacy Data on Lenalidomide in DLBCL  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relapsed / Refractory DLBCL  
Single agent lenalidomide activity in relapsed or refractory DLBCL subjects has been noted in 
two Celgene -sponsored single arm clinical trials in aggressive NHL  (aNHL) : study CC -5013 -
NHL-002 and study CC -5013 -NHL-003.(57, 58) Data from both studie s were combined for a 
revised analysis of [ADDRESS_251902] 
baseline characteristics were similar. Results showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 
26.1% (35/134), a median PFS of 2.7 months, and a median r esponse duration of 6.0 
months. (59) In these clinical trials, COO typi[INVESTIGATOR_210802].  
 
Hernandez -Ilizaliturri et al reported  in a retrospective analysis of 40 relapsed/refractory aNHL 
subjects (34 DLBCL, 6 composite/transformed DLBCL) treated with single agent lenalidomide 
at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Mayo Clinic, University of Bologna, and Hackensack 
University that there  was a preferential clinical activity of lenalidomide in patients with the non -
GCB subtype DLBCL. (47) The tumor response rate was an impressive 52.9% (5 CR, 4 PR) in 
the non -GCB su btype although with the caveat of a small sample size (n=17) compared with 
only 8.7% (1 CR, 1 PR) in the GCB subtype (n=23). The median PFS for lenalidomide was 6.2 
months for the non -GCB and 1.7 months for the GCB subtype (p=0.004). Importantly, there 
were no significant differences in the age, disease stage at time of treatment, international

 16 prognostic index (IPI) scores, or number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_210803].  
 
These observations led to the CC -5013 -DLC-001 phase II/III randomized clinical t rial of single 
agent lenalidomide versus investigator’s choice in subjects with relapsed/refractory DLBCL in 
GCB and non -GCB subtypes. In this trial, subjects with relapsed DLBCL underwent COO 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_210804], which was used to assign sub jects to two different cohorts 
defined by [CONTACT_210843]. The subjects were subsequently randomized to receive lenalidomide 
or single agent of investigator choice, and the ongoing as of December 2014. At the time of the 
planned final analysis (N=102 intention  to treat patients (ITT) who were randomized, received 
at least one dose of therapy; 54 non -GCB, 48 GCB), the CC -5013 -DLC-001 study showed a 
statistically significant improvement of median PFS for lenalidomide versus investigator’s 
choice treatment in the non-GCB subtype as assessed by [CONTACT_210844] (IRAC, control 7.1 weeks versus lenalidomide 15.2 weeks; p = 0.021, HR 
[95% CI] = 0.50 [0.27, 0.92]). In addition, there was a favorable trend in ORR as assessed by 
[CONTACT_210845] (control 11.5%  versus lenalidomide 28.6%, p=0.179)). There was also a favorable trend 
in median OS in the non -GCB subtype (control 20.4 weeks versus lenalidomide 32.3 weeks; p 
= 0.253, HR [95% CI] = 0.70 [0.38, 1.30]). Potentially influencing the OS data, 16/26 (61.5%) of 
non-GCB subjects in the control arm crossed over to lenalidomide upon radiological evidence 
of disease progression on the comparator treatment.  
 
The CC -5013 -DLC-001 study also included exploratory objectives related to gene expression 
profiling. If medi cally feasible, subjects were required to provide a fresh frozen lymph node or 
tumor biopsy at study enrollment; biopsies for 65 subjects were provided. Samples were then 
typed as ABC, GCB, or unclassifiable using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip microarr ays. 
At the time of planned final analysis (N= [ADDRESS_251903] one 
dose of therapy, 27 ABC type, 8 unclassifiable type, 30 GCB type) the study showed a 
favorable trend in median PFS for lenalidomide versus investigator’s choic e treatment in the 
ABC type as assessed by [CONTACT_210845] (control 6.3 weeks versus lenalidomide 82.0 weeks; p = 0.105, 
HR [95% CI] = 0.44 [0.15 – 1.23]). There was also a favorable trend in median OS in the ABC 
type (control 18.6 weeks versus lenalidomide 108.4 wee ks; p = 0.144, HR [95% CI] = 0.47 
[0.17, 1.33]).  
 
Taken together, these data of lenalidomide single agent in subjects with relapsed DLBCL 
suggest that lenalidomide has preferential activity in non -GCB and ABC types of DLBCL. 
Further evidence supporting thi s preferential activity in the non -GCB subtype is observed in 
preclinical models (Section 1.4).

Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 17 treatment of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL. (4) Two academic clinical research groups 
have developed the combination regimen of len alidomide + rituximab + CHOP (R2 -CHOP) in 
patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL: the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center in the US and the Italian 
cooperative group, Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Mayo Clinic R2 -CHOP Data  
Protocol MC078E is an investigator initia ted Phase 1/2 study of R2 -CHOP in subjects with 
newly diagnosed, previously untreated DLBCL and follicular grade IIIA/B B -cell lymphoma, 
sponsored by [CONTACT_68281].  
 
The objective of the Phase 1 cohort of this study was to establish the maximum tolerated  dose 
(MTD) of lenalidomide that could be combined with R -CHOP. A total of [ADDRESS_251904] 
dose R -CHOP every 21 days. The lenalidomide dose levels tested were 15, 20, and 25 mg. 
The median age was 65 (35 -82) years and 54% were over 60 years. Three subjects received 
15 mg, 3 received 20 mg, and 18 received 25 mg of len alidomide. No dose -limiting toxicity  
(DLT)  was found, and 25 mg on Days 1 -10 was the recommended dose for the Phase 2 
portion of this study. The incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 67% 
and 21%, respectively. Febrile neutropenia was ra re (4%) and there were no deaths due to 
toxicity. The ORR was 100% with a CR rate of 77%. It was concluded that lenalidomide at the 
dose of 25 mg/day administered on Days 1 to 10 of 21 -day cycle can be safely combined with 
R-CHOP in the initial chemotherap y of aggressive B -cell lymphoma. (60)

Based on these phase 1 results, the phase 2 cohort of the study was conducted to assess the 
efficacy of this combination. Response was evaluated using PET/CT by [CONTACT_48928]. (6) 
The final results were recently reported with a total of sixty four  subjects with DLBCL accrued 
to the Phase 2 cohort with median follow up of 23.5 months. (61) All subjects received R -
CHOP21 for 6 cycles plus lenalidomide 25 mg (R2 -CHOP) on Days 1 – 10 of each cycle. 
Although not prospectively planned, subjects were retrospectively subtyped by [CONTACT_210846] (Hans, 2004). In the 60 evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 98%, 
with 80% achieving a complete response. Furthermore , [ADDRESS_251905] R -CHOP alone served as a contemporaneously matched control. Table Table 1.  Patient Characteristics  from Nowakowski et al

Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 19 1 below describes the baseline characte ristics of the DLBCL subjects treated with R2 -CHOP in  
the Mayo Clinic phase 2 trial and the 87 subjects treated with R -CHOP as matched control. (61) 
Subjects treated with R2 -CHOP had fewer subjects with low IPI [INVESTIGATOR_210806] R -CHOP cohort.   
 
Safety data of the R2 -CHOP regimen showed the most common Grade 3 and 4 toxicities with  
R2-CHOP were neutropenia (12% Grade 3, 74% Grade 4), thrombocytopenia (30% Grade 3,  
16% Grade 4), anemia (20% Grade 3, 0% Grade 4), febrile neutropenia (12% Grade 3, 0% 
Grade  4), pneumonia (2% Grade 3, 0% Grade 4), sepsis (0% Grade 3, 2% Grade 4), venous 
thrombosis (0% Grade 3, 2% Grade 4), fatigue (2% Grade  3, 0% Grade 4) and dehydration 
(2% Grade 3, 0% Grade 4). Overall, R2 -CHOP is considered well tolerated and has promising 
efficacy. (61)  
 
It is noted that an unplanned COO subtype co hort analysis, as defined by [CONTACT_210847], found 
that combination of lenalidomide with RCHOP appears to have improved outcomes, especially 
in the non -GCB subtype in comparison with the historical control patients. The 2 -year PFS in 
the RCHOP control group w as only 52% (95% CI: 43% – 64%), and the median follow up for 
patients still alive was 41.2 months (range: 11.6 – 78.3 months). By [CONTACT_210848], the 
historical RCHOP therapy achieved a 2 -year PFS of 28% (95% CI: 15% – 51%) for the non -
GCB subtype, and 64% ( 95% CI: 53% - 78%) for the GCB subtype (log -rank p<0.001). In the 
patients treated with lenalidomide and RCHOP (R2CHOP), there was no difference in 2 -year 
PFS between non -GCB (60%, 95% CI: 41% - 81%) and GCB (59%, 95% CI: 44% - 80%). In 
the RCHOP group, th e 2-year OS in the non -GCB was 46%, as compared with 78% in the 
GCB group. In the R2CHOP group, the 2 -year OS was improved to 83% in the non -GCB 
group, as compared to 75% in the non -GCB group. The implication of this evaluation of a 
prospective clinical tr ial and historical control is that the PFS and OS for non -GCB DLBCL 
patients is significantly improved with the addition of lenalidomide to RCHOP. An additional 
finding is that the outcome for patients with GCB DLBCL did not appear to have worsened 
outcome s with the addition of lenalidomide to standard immunochemotherapy.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  FIL R2 -CHOP Data  
The Italian cooperative group FIL conducted a prospectively designed multicenter phase 1/2 
study to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of lenalidomide plus R -CHOP21 in u ntreated elderly 
DLBCL subjects, the REAL07 trial. (62) 
 
The objective of the Phase 1 cohort of the REAL07 trial was to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose of this combination. Four lenalidomide doses (5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/day on 
Days 1 -14) using the continual reassessment method were planned in combination with each 
course of R -CHOP for a  total of [ADDRESS_251907] cohorts (n=3 each) were treated 
(total n=21) at 10, 20, 15, 15, 15, 10, and [ADDRESS_251908] dose -level of 
lenalidomide (15 mg/day) was selected as the maximum tolerated dose, with an estimated 
DLT probability of 0.345 (95% credibility interval 0.164 -0.553). Grade 3 -4 hematologic adverse 
events were: neutropenia in 28% of the courses, thrombocytopenia in 9%, and an emia in 3%. 
Non-hematologic toxicities were moderate: grade 4 increase of creatinine phosphokinase 
(n=1), grade 3 cardiac (n=2), grade 3 neurologic (n=3), and grade 3 gastrointestinal (n=1). In 
this phase 1 study, 90% of subjects achieved an overall respon se with 81% achieving 
complete remission. It was concluded that this combination is tolerable in elderly DLBCL 
subjects, and lenalidomide given at [ADDRESS_251909] R -CHOP21 was the recommended dosing schedule fo r Phase 2 study. (63, 64) Nine 
subjects were treated at this dosing schedule in the Phase 1 cohort.  
 
Phase 2 of the REAL07 trial was a study to investigate the efficacy of R2 -CHOP in CD20+ 
elderly DLBCL or FL grade IIIB subjects. Key inclusion criteria i ncluded age 60 -80, Ann Arbor 
stage II -IV, and IPI > 2. The primary endpoints were ORR and CR rate after [ADDRESS_251910] R -CHOP21 for 6 cycles. Subjects were 
retrospectively subtyped by [CONTACT_210849], although this analysis was not 
prospectively planned. (15) 
 
Forty -nine subjects were enrolled. The phase 2 cohort data analyses included these 40 
subjects plus 9 subjects from the phase 1 cohort treated at the rec ommended phase 2 
dose/schedule (total N=49). The most significant common hematological toxicities recorded in 
277 cycles of treatment were neutropenia (9% grade 3, 22% grade 4), leukocytopenia (15% 
grade 3, 13% grade 4), febrile neutropenia (3% grade 3, 1% , grade 4), thrombocytopenia (5% 
grade 3, 7% grade 4), and anemia (4% grade 3, < 0.5% grade 4) The most significant common 
hematological toxicities recorded in 277 cycles of treatment were neutropenia (9% grade 3, 
22% grade 4), leukocytopenia (15% grade 3,  13% grade 4), febrile neutropenia (3% grade 3, 
1%, grade 4), thrombocytopenia (5% grade 3, 7% grade 4), and anemia (4% grade 3, < 0.5% 
grade 4) .  
 
The overall results for all 49 subjects showed a CR rate of 86%, ORR 92%, 2 -year PFS 80%, 
and 2 -year OS 92%.  Among these 49 subjects, GCB vs. non -GCB typi[INVESTIGATOR_210807] 34 subjects (17 subjects with GCB, and 17 subjects with non -GCB) by [CONTACT_210850]. (15) The CR rate in subjects with non -GCB subtype appears to be essentially  
equivalent to that of the in GCB subtype subjects (88% vs. 81%). In addition, as was observed 
in the Mayo Clinic study, among the subjects treated with R2 -CHOP regimen, the PFS and OS 
curves of the subjects with the non -GCB subtype appear to be about the same as or better 
Protocol [ADDRESS_251911] tissue available for subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Among the patients 
with non -GCB DLBCL, the 2 -year PFS was 81% (95% CI: 51 -93) compared with 71% (95% CI: 
51-93) for the patients with GCB DLBCL, with a hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.21 - 2.9, 
p=0.705).  The 2 -year OS was 94% (95% CI: 63 – 99) in non -GCB DLBCL, and 88% (95% CI: 
59 – 97) in GCB DLBCL, with a hazard ratio of 0.5 1 (95% CI: 0.05 – 5.63, p=0.58). Together, 
these data suggest that adding lenalidomide to standard therapy improved treatment outcome 
in non -GCB subjects who have a poor prognosis and typi[INVESTIGATOR_44769] a worse outcome to 
treatment.  
 
1.6.5  Clinical Efficacy Data Con clusion  
In summary, the R2 -CHOP efficacy data from the Mayo Clinic MC078E study and the FIL 
REAL07 study compare favorably to historical R -CHOP21 data with a better CR rate at the end 
of induction therapy and better PFS. Furthermore, promising efficacy res ults were also 
demonstrated in the non -GCB subtype, which generally has a poorer outcome when treated 
with R -CHOP alone. Clinically meaningful improvements as demonstrated by [CONTACT_210851] -GCB DLBCL subjects are considered significan t in this difficult to treat 
sub-population (Table 2). (61, 62) This data is not direct comparison, but supports the 
hypothesis that lenalidomide is able to overcome the adverse outcomes associated with non -
GCB DLBCL.

The combination of lenalidomide and RCHOP is tolerable, without unexpected toxicities. The 
Grade 3 and 4 toxicities are primarily hematological, and manageable with supportive care.

Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 22  
1.7 OBINUTUZUMAB  
Obinutuzumab (GA101, RO5072759), is a glycoengineered, humanized, type II anti -CD20 
monoclonal antibody (mAb).  Obinutuzumab was derived by [CONTACT_27892] B -
Ly1 mouse antibody and subsequent glycoengineering leading to the following 
characteristics (65, 66):  high antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC); high affinity 
binding to the CD20 antigen; low complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity; and 
antibody dependent cellula r phagocytosis (ADCP) through recruitment of Fc RIII positive 
immune effector cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and monocytes; and high 
direct cell death induction.  
 
Given the direct cell death inducing properties of obinutuzumab and th e significantly enhanced 
ADCC in preclinical assays, it is possible that obinutuzumab may have greater efficacy than 
the widely used anti -CD20 -mAb rituximab (Rituxan).  
 
1.7.[ADDRESS_251912] a number of aggressive SC and disseminated NHL xenograft 
models. Obinutuzumab induced complete tumor remission and long term survival (cures) and 
increased the overall survival  in disseminated NHL xenograft models. The efficacious and 
optimal dose range of obinutuzumab in xenograft models was in the range of 10 -30 mg/kg, 
corresponding to trough levels of 300 -600 μg/mL. In addition, obinutuzumab showed efficacy in 
combination wit h classical chemotherapeutic agents, such as chlorambucil, fludarabine and 
bendamustine. Importantly, the combination of obinutuzumab with chemotherapeutic agents 
was superior to the combination of these agents with rituximab. Treatment with obinutuzumab 
also resulted in potent and superior depletion of B -cells in the peripheral blood and in lymphoid  
tissues of hCD20 transgenic mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Vaccination studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys and human CD20 transgenic mice showed that the enhanced effi cacy in 
terms of B -cell depletion of obinutuzumab translated into suppression of de novo antibody 
responses, but left the protective humoral memory responses intact.  
 
The data generated to date imply that obinutuzumab represents a novel therapeutic CD20 
antibody with outstanding efficacy compared to classical Type I and non -ADCC enhanced 
Protocol [ADDRESS_251913] been characterized in a number of 
clinical studie s, in patients with CLL or NHL. These studies include Phase 1 and 2 
monotherapy studies (BO20999 and BO21003), a Phase Ib combination study (BO21000) and 
a Phase 3 combination study (BO21004). A serum sampling scheme for the quantitation of 
obinutuzumab wa s undertaken in these studies to enable population PK analysis.  
 
Population PK modeling was undertaken on all available serum concentration data from 
studies BO20999, BO21003, BO21000 and BO21004/CLL11 to provide a robust description of 
the PK behavior of obinutuzumab. This demonstrated that a two compartment PK model 
comprising both a linear clearance pathway and a non -linear time varying clearance pathway 
adequately described serum obinutuzumab concentration data. The initial clearance of 
obinutuzumab was  2.[ADDRESS_251914] is consistent with catabolism of IgG 
antibodies, and is therefore independent of CD20 positive cells. This analysis further supports 
the need to minimize the time varying clearance component quickly, and has lead to the 
proposed dose and regimen of 1000 mg in both induction and extended treatment. In the 
Phase II part of study BO21003, which investigated the 1000 mg obinutuzumab dose taken 
into Phase III, the PK of obinutuz umab was assessed in patients with indolent non -Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (iNHL) who received weekly administrations of 1000 mg of obinutuzumab during the 
induction phase (4 administrations; Cycle 1 – Cycle 4) followed by [CONTACT_210852] o f 1000 mg obinutuzumab every 2 months until disease progression. The 
mean obinutuzumab serum concentration increased markedly over the 4 treatment cycles. 
Following the final (i.e., fourth) administration of the induction treatment, obinutuzumab serum 
levels decreased. Overall, mean C trough serum levels of obinutuzumab observed during the 
maintenance regimen were similar across the 12 maintenance cycles.  
 
In study BO21004/CLL11, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_127815], mean serum 
obinutuzumab concentratio ns increased from Cycle 1 to Cycle 2 following administration of 
obinutuzumab on Day 1/2 ([ADDRESS_251915] 1000 mg dose over 2

rapid minimization of the time varying clearance component indicative of depletion of CD20+ 
tumor cells.  
 
In Phase Ib study BO21000, the PK of obinutuzumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) is 
being investigated in patients with relapsed/refractory FL. Based on preliminary PK data, for 
both combinations, obinutuzumab serum concentrations increased with increases in dose. In 
this same study, the effect of obinutuzumab on the PK of bendamustine was investigated in 
first-line NHL patients. The 2 cohorts  (obinutuzumab + bendamustine and obinutuzumab + 
CHOP) showed similar PK profiles (serum obinutuzumab serum concentrations versus time), 
similar increases in systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC7 days) from Cycle 1 (Day 1 and Day 
8) to end of treatment cycle, t otal clearance, and volume of distribution (Vc). The effect of  
obinutuzumab on the PK of bendamustine is also being investigated in an ongoing Phase III 
study in rituximab -refractory iNHL patients. Based on preliminary data, there were no 
differences in be ndamustine clearance when given with obinutuzumab compared to 
bendamustine alone following single administration. Similarly, no changes in half -life were 
observed for bendamustine when given in combination with obinutuzumab compared to 
bendamustine alone.  
 
Consistent with the mechanism of action of obinutuzumab, extensive B -cell depletion was 
observed both in patients with NHL and CLL. In most patients receiving obinutuzumab 
monotherapy, there was no notable increase in complement levels during or following  an 
infusion. Changes in the levels of IL -[ADDRESS_251917] provides an adequate description of the PK of obinutuzumab following 
intravenous (IV) administration in Studies  BO20999 and BO21003.  Following the infusion of 
obinutuzumab , the elimination appears to be characterized by a clearance pathway that is 
dependent on time (i.e., starting at a typi[INVESTIGATOR_27797] 630 mL/day  and then gradually 
decreasing to an asymptote of 60  mL/day at steady state) and a linear clearance pathway.  
Tumor burden may potentially contribute significantly to the clearance of obinutuzumab, 
especially at the beginning of treatment when CD20 -positiv e tumor cells are most abundant.  
As tumor burden decreases, the clearance reaches an asymptote, which is believed to be 
primarily a function of the proteolytic metabolic clearance.  Consequently, some  patients with a 
high tumor burden may appear to clear the drug from the plasma faster than do patients with a

NHL treated with obinutuzumab as monotherapy or in combination che motherapy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Obinutuzumab Monotherapy  
In the monotherapy setting, the proportion of patients who had a CR or PR at the end of 
treatment ranged from 28% to 58%. Although this was a population with treatment -refractory or 
relapsed disease, some patients in st udies BO20999 and JO21900 achieved a CR by [CONTACT_5014] -
of-treatment assessment.  The Phase I of study BO20999 recruited 21 NHL patients; 
lymphoma subtypes were follicular (n=13), mantle cell (n=4), diffuse large B -cell (n=1), small 
lymphocytic (n=1), lymphoplas macytic lymphoma (n=1) and Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinaemia (n=1). In the Phase I part of the study, 7 patients (33%) had a response at 
the end of treatment. In the Phase II part, 11 patients (28%) with aNHL and 15 patients (38%) 
with iNHL had a response a t the end of treatment.  In Phase II, end -of-treatment response for 
iNHL was 17% (3 PR) for patients receiving 400/400 mg (n=18) obinutuzumab and 55% (2 CR, 
10 PR) in the 1600/800 mg cohort (n=22).  The Phase I part of study BO21003 included 17 
patients: 10 with FL, 3 with DLBCL, 2 with lymphocytic lymphoma, and one each with mantle 
cell lymphoma ( MCL ) and marginal zone lymphoma. At the end of the (induction) treatment 
period, no patients had CR, 5 patients (29%) had PR, 2 patients had progressive disease  (PD), 
and 1 patient had no data.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Obinutuzumab Combination Therapy  
In the Phase Ib chemotherapy combination study, BO21000, 53/56 relapsed/refractory patients 
(95%) had a response (CR+PR) at the end of treatment; one had PD, one had stable disease 
(SD) and on e had no response assessment due to early withdrawal. In patients with previously 
untreated B -cell FL, 76/81 patients (94%) responded at the end of treatment; one each had SD

combination study than for the monotherapy studies (relapsed/refractory setting: 39% [11/28 
patients] in the obinutuzumab + CHOP arm and 50% [14/28 patients] in the obinutuzumab +

Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 27 studies with obinutuzumab for patients with CD20 -positiv e B-cell malignancies. Obinutuzumab 
monotherapy has been well tolerated, with a preliminary  safety profile similar to that of 
rituximab in NHL patients (i.e., mainly Grade [ADDRESS_251922]  infusion, and decreasing with subsequent 
infusions). Obinutuzumab has been  administered to patients at doses ranging between [ADDRESS_251923] current monoclonal antibodies, a flat dose (not adapted to body weight or  body 
surface area [BSA]) h as been chosen  for obinutuzumab combination trials . The rationale for 
use of flat dosing was based on  the fact that a ntibody clearance is mostly determined by [CONTACT_210853], i.e., tumor burden and accessibility to normal or malignant tumor 
cells in various  compartments, such as blood, bone marrow, and lymphatic organs, rather than 
body  weight or surface  area. In contrast, the dose of the first monoclonal antibody licensed  for 
the treatment of B -cell malignancies was calculated on the basis of BSA.  
 
In the  1990s, determination of the dose for monoclonal antibodies followed an approach typi[INVESTIGATOR_210808], for which an upper dose -limiting toxicity is usually determined. The  toxicity 
is generally a function of the capacity to eliminate the drug by [CONTACT_210854], 
limiting and narrowing the therapeutic window, and thereby [CONTACT_37228] a n adaptation of the dose 
using body weight or BSA. In effect, most monoclonal antibodies,  including those targeting 
CD20, reveal a wide therapeutic window without the need to  adjust dosing by [CONTACT_210855]. However, because quantifying the target and  adjusting individual dosing according to 
target has been notoriously difficult, the currently  accepted approach for most monoclonal 
antibodies, including nearly all of those  targeting CD20 in various stages of development, is flat 
dosing  
 
1.7.[ADDRESS_251924] the safety of patients.  
 
1.7.7  Overview of Safety of Obinutuzumab  
Obinutuzumab has been administered to approximately 1310 patients with CD20 -positive 
malignancies.  Both in patients with NHL and with CLL, infusion -related reaction s (IRR) were  
the most common AE in clinical trials conducted to date.  They were predominantly associated 
with the first infusion, generally occurring early during the infusion, shortly after, or in some 
cases up to 24 hours after the completion of the infusion with o binutuzumab.  The incidence 
and intensity of IRRs decreased with subsequent infusions of obinutuzumab.  In a few patients, 
concurrent signs of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) were observed.  Other frequently observed 
AEs include infections and neutropenia.  The se events appeared to be more common in 
patients with CLL compared to NHL.  
 
In trials investigating the combination of obinutuzumab and CHOP, FC, chlorambucil or 
bendamustine, the incidence of AEs in the treatment arms with combined use was consistent 
with the known safety profiles of the individual study drugs.  So far, no maximum tolerated 
dose, no DLT, and no clear dose -related trends in the incidence of AEs have been determined.  
 
A pooled analysis of safety data for obinutuzumab collected during the mon otherapy studies 
BO20999 and BO21003 was conducted in  patients with NHL ( aNHL] and iNHL ) or CLL who 
participated in those two studies (both Phase I and Phase II) and received monotherapy 
treatment with obinutuzumab and included a total 205 patients with NH L (49 aNHL and 156 
iNHL patients) and 38 patients with CLL.  
 
In the group of 38 patients with CLL  treated with obinutuzumab monotherapy , the majority of 
patients (25 [66%]) were treated for  4 weeks to  6 months.  Eleven patie nts (29%) were 
exposed for 6  to  12 months, and two patients (5%) were exposed for 12 months or longer.  
Eight of 38 patients (21%) with CLL were withdrawn during the treatment phase; 4 patients 
(11%) were withdrawn due to AEs, which indicates that AEs were mostly manageable.  Almos t 
all patients (37/38 [97%]) experienced an IRR.  The number of patients with Grade 3
 4 IRRs 
was 11/38 (29%).  As is typi[INVESTIGATOR_210809], blood and lymphatic system disorders 
were among the most frequently reported AEs, in particular neutropenia (13/38  patients 
[34%]), febrile neutropenia (5/38 patients [13%]), and thrombocytopenia (7/38 patients [18%]).  
 
Infections and infestations were common AEs, occurring in 21/38 patients (55%).  Infections 
reported in more than one patient were nasopharyngit is (6 patients), bronchitis and sinusitis (4

 29 patients each), influenza and lung infection (3 patients each), and herpes zoster and oral 
herpes (2 patients each).  
 
Thirteen patients (34%) died, [ADDRESS_251925] difference in the incidences was seen for neutropenia 
(occurring in 47% of patients with CLL [18/38] vs. 8% of patients with aNHL [4/49] and 8% of 
patients with iNHL [13/156]) and treatment -related AEs associated with the infusion (100% 
[38/38] vs. 80% (39/49) and 83% [129/156]).  
 
To date, a very small number of patients have experienced tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS) (six in 
total); four patients in the aNHL population (population including MCL) and one patient each in 
the CLL and iNHL populations.  
 
Infections have been reported in 20/49 aNHL patients (41%), 74/156 iNHL patients (47%), and 
21/38 CLL patients (55%).  One iNHL patient was withdrawn from the study because of an 
infection.  In addition, one CLL patient and one iNHL patient died from an infection (septic 
shock in both cases) during survival follow -up [ADDRESS_251926], all for IRRs.  An additional patient in the iNHL group discontinued treatment because 
of an infection.  This indicates that these events were generally manageable.  
 
In the Phase III Study BO21004 (CLL11), comparison of obinutuzumab  + chlorambucil to 
chlorambucil alone showed that the most common AEs  (all grades, Grades 3  − 4), 
respectively, were IRRs (69% vs. 0, 21% vs. 0), neutropenia (40% vs. 18%, 34% vs. 16%), 
thrombocytopenia (15% vs. 7%, 11% vs. 3%), anemia (12% vs.  10%, 4% vs. 5%), leukopenia 
(7% vs. 0, 5% vs. 0), pyrexia (10% vs. 7%,   1 vs. 0), and cough (10% vs. 7%, 0 vs.   1%). 
The incidence of IRRs was 69% with the first infusion of obinutuzumab.  The incidence of 
Grade 3 or 4 IRRs was 21%, with 8% of patient s discontinuing therapy.  The incidence of 
reactions with subsequent infusions was 3%, with the second 1000 -mg dose and <1% 
thereafter.  No Grade [ADDRESS_251927] 53 patients receiving obinutuzumab  in the trial, 47 (89%) experienced an IRR.  After this 
Protocol [ADDRESS_251928] dose was also divided into two 
infusions (100 mg on Day  1 and 900 mg on Day 2).  Of the 45 patients for whom these 
mitigation measures were implemented, 21  patients (47%) experienced a reaction with the first 
1000 -mg dose and <2% thereafter.  
 
The incidence of neutropenia reported as an AE was 40% in the obinut uzumab -treated arm 
and 18% in the chlorambucil -alone arm, with the incidence of serious adverse events ( SAEs ) 
being 1% and 0%, respectively.  Cases of late -onset neutropenia (occurring 28 days after 
completion of treatment or later) were 16% in the obinutu zumab -treated arm and 12% in the 
chlorambucil -alone arm.  
The incidence of infections was similar between arms.  Thirty -eight percent of patients in the 
obinutuzumab - treated arm experienced an infection, 9% were Grade 3  − 4, and none were 
fatal.  
 
The inc idence of thrombocytopenia reported as an AE was 15% in the obinutuzumab -treated 
arm and 7% in the chlorambucil -alone arm.  Five percent of patients in the obinutuzumab -
treated arm experienced acute thrombocytopenia (occurring within 24 hours after the 
obinutuzumab infusion).  
 
The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TLS was 2% in the obinutuzumab -treated arm vs. 0% in the 
chlorambucil -alone arm.  
 
AEs related to musculoskeletal disorders, including pain (System Organ Class), have been 
reported with obinutuzumab with  higher incidence than with the comparator (17% vs. 13%, 
respectively). (67) 
 
1.7.8  Risks Associated with Obinutuzumab Therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation  
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in som e cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic 
failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with anti -CD20 antibodies such as 
obinutuzumab.  HBV reactivation has been reported in patients who are hepatitis B surface 
antigen (HBsAg) positive and als o in patients who are HBsAg negative but are hepatitis B core 
antibody (anti -HBc) positive.  Reactivation has also occurred in patients who appear to have 
resolved hepatitis B infection (i.e., HBsAg negative, anti -HBc positive, and hepatitis B surface 
antibody [anti -HBs] positive).  HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV 
replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level or detection of HBsAg in a 
person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti -HBc positive.  Reactivation  of HBV 
replication is often followed by [CONTACT_971], i.e., increase in transaminase levels and, in severe 
cases, increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death.  
Protocol [ADDRESS_251929] 
regarding the safety of resuming obinutuzumab in patients who develop HBV reactivation.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy  
JC virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which can be 
fatal, was obs erved in patients treated with obinutuzumab.  Consider the diagnosis of PML in 
any patient presenting with new onset or changes to pre -existing neurologic manifestations.  
Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture.  Discontinue obinutuzumab therapy 
and consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or 
immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion -Related Reactions  
Obinutuzumab can cause severe and life -threatening IRRs.  Two -thirds of patients 
experienced a reaction to the first 1000 mg of obinutuzumab infusion.  IRRs can also occur 
with subsequent infusions.  Symptoms may include hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (e.g., bronchospasm, larynx and throat irritation, wheezing, and 
laryngeal edema).  Other common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
hypertension, flushing, headache, pyrexia, and chills.  
 
Pre-medicate patients with aceta minophen, antihistamine, and a glucocorticoid .  Institute 
medical management (e.g., glucocorticoids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilators, and/or oxygen) for 
IRRs as needed.  Closely monitor patients during the entire infusion.  IRRs within [ADDRESS_251930] hour after administration of each obinutuzumab infusion until blood 
pressure is stable.  For patients at increased risk of hypertensive crisis, consider th e benefits 
versus the risks of withholding their hypertensive medication as is suggested here.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
Acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and/or hyperphosphatemia 
from TLS can occur within 12  − [ADDRESS_251931] infusion.  Patients with high tumor 
burden and/or high circulating lymphocyte count (   25  109/L) are at greater risk for TLS and 
should receive appropriate tumor lysis prophylaxis with anti -hyperuricemics (e.g., allopurinol) 
and hydration beginning 12  − [ADDRESS_251932] electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and fluid balance, and administer 
supportive care, including dialysis as indicated.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infection  
Serio us bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections can occur during and following 
obinutuzumab therapy.  Do not administer obinutuzumab to patients with an active infection.  
Patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections may be at i ncreased risk of infection.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Neutropenia  
Obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil caused Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in 34% of 
patients in clinical trials.  Patients with Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia should be monitored 
frequently with regular laboratory t ests until resolution.  Anticipate, evaluate, and treat any 
symptoms or signs of developi[INVESTIGATOR_5904].  Neutropenia can also be of late onset (occurring 
more than 28 days after completion of treatment) and/or prolonged (lasting longer than 28 
days).  
 
Patients with neutropenia are strongly recommended to receive antimicrobial prophylaxis 
throughout the treatment period.  Antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis should be considered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Thrombocytopenia  
Obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil caused Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 
12% of patients in clinical trials.  In 5% of patients, obinutuzumab caused an acute 
thrombocytopenia occurring within 24 hours after the obinutuzumab infusion.  In patients with 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, monitor platelet co unts more frequently until resolution.  
Transfusion of blood products (i.e., platelet transfusion) may be necessary.  
 
1.8 STUDY RATIONALE

  Version 1.4 April 5, 2018  
 
 
Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 33 Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy with 
~30,000 new cases in the US annually, is uniformly treated with a combination (CHOP) which 
remains essentially unchanged over the past 30+ years.(1) DLBCL biology now includes the 
definition of two distinct subtypes with unique gene expression programs,(2 -4) genomic 
abnormalities,(5) microRNA pro files,(6 -8) signaling pathways,(9 -12) and response to targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].(13,14) These substantial advances in understanding DLBCL biology do not yet 
influence the frontline therapy of DLBCL patients, which achieves 5 -year overall survival rates 
in activat ed B -cell (ABC) and germinal center B -cell subtypes (GCB) DLBCL of ~50% and 
~70%, respectively. The ABC subtype requires constitutive activity of the targetable B -cell 
receptor and NF -κB pathways for survival . Recent work has demonstrated the subtype -
selec tive activity of lenalidomide in ABC DLBCL comes from inhibition of the expression of the 
survival -critical transcription factor IRF4  (Figure 2) . When lenalidomide reduces IRF4 
expression, a synthetically lethal interferon response occurs in ABC DLBCL cell  lines.  
 
Figure 2. The BCR pathway and target for lenalidomide  
The clinical activity of lenalidomide in DLBCL has been shown to be significant, as a single 
agent (ABC DLBCL ORR 52%, 14, 16) or in combination with R -CHOP. (ORR 92%, CR 86%, 
equivalent in ABC and GCB DLBCL, 17 -19). Equally impressive is that both lenalidomide was 
able to be dose escalated to its maximal studied level without significant toxicity when 
combined with R -CHOP. Based on the promising efficacy and toxicity data, lena lidomide is 
being evaluated in two randomized trials in combination with R -CHOP, and may file for an FDA 
indication/registration.  
 
Obinutuzumab (G) is a novel, glycoengineered type II anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody with

with rituximab. Obinutuzumab has shown promising single agent activity in relapsed DLBCL 
(ORR: 24 – 37% in a Phase I study, 20). Obinutuzumab has also been combined successfully 
with chemotherapy inclu ding CHOP in indolent lymphomas (21) and aggressive lymphomas 
(22). A randomized trial comparing rituximab and obinutuzumab with CHOP has recently 
completed accrual, with highly anticipated results expected in 2015 (23).  
 
The hypothesis  of this clinical trial is that the combination of lenalidomide + obinutuzumab  
with CHOP will be tolerable and result in an ORR at least even to lenalidomide + rituximab with 
CHOP. Based upon the above data, we propose to conduct a Phase Ib/II trial to eva luate the 
combination of lenalidomide, obinutuzumab, and CHOP in patients with DLBCL

 35 2. OBJECTIVES  
2.1 PRIMARY  
The primary objective of the phase Ib portion of the trial will be to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose of lenalidomide + obinutuzumab with CHOP.  
 
The primary objectives of the Phase II portion of the trial will be to determine the efficacy 
(complete  and overall response rate).  
 
2.2 SECONDARY  
The secondary objectives of the Phase Ib portion will include the efficacy (overall and 
complete response rate)  and tolerability of lenalidomide + obinutuzumab with CHOP.  
 
The secondary objectives of the Phase II portion will include determination of the survival 
outcomes (progression free and overall survival), and safety.  
 
Exploratory objectives will include the  comprehensive genomic profiling of patient tumor 
and blood samples to attempt correlation with response, evaluation of immune cell subsets in 
peripheral blood at diagnosis and end of therapy to attempt correlation with response, and use 
of novel technolog y to evaluate for circulating tumor DNA of the lymphoma immunoglobulin 
heavy chain to attempt correlation with response.

 36 3. STUDY DES IGN 
This will be a single arm, single institution, open -label phase Ib/II clinical trial of lenalidomide, 
obinutuzumab, and CHOP to evaluate the safety and efficacy in subjects with previously 
untreated CD20+ DLBCL. This study is divided into Screening ( 3.2), Treatment ( 3.3) and 
Follow -up Periods ( 3.4). Details of the study treatments are described in Section  5. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_251934] 3+3 design.  
 
During Phase II, patients will receive lenalidomide + obinutuzumab with CHOP  for a total of 6 
cycles.  
  
It is anticipated that a total of 59 patients will be enrolled in the Phase Ib/Phase II trial. The 
study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
 
3.[ADDRESS_251935] be completed within 28 days prior to enrollment . The 
only exceptions to the 28 -day time period are for the lymph node / tumor biopsy and the bone 
marrow biopsy / optional aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337],  which may occur up to 6 weeks  prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.  
 
During the Screening Period, subjects will undergo safety and other assessments to determine 
eligibility for the study as shown in Section  7.1. 
Key aspects of screening include MD Anderson Pathology assessment of disease diagnosis, 
CD20+ status; local assessment of bone marrow involvement by [CONTACT_56927]; documentation of 
measurable disease by [CONTACT_3610]; collection of a PET scan; and verification of adequate liver, 
renal, cardiac, and bone marrow function.  
 
3.3 TREATMENT PERIOD  
The Treatment Period begins with Cycle 1 Day 1 dosing of the chemotherapy drugs as 
described in Section 5. Subjects will receive protocol -specified treatments for 6 cycles. 
Treatment will continue to completion, or until the outcome of the mid -therapy  PET scan 
between Weeks 7 – 9 (after Cycle 3 but before Cy cle 4) indicates a treatment change; disease 
progression; unacceptable toxicity; death; or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.  
 
In order to manage toxicity and allow subjects to complete 6 cycles of treatment, dose delay

Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 37 and modification rules w ill be followed (Section  5.1 and 6). Key aspects of ongoing safety 
monit oring include physical exam, AE assessment, and hematology / chemistry laboratory 
testing prior to the initiation of every cycle, and at additional time points as shown in the 
Section 7. 
 
Key aspects of ongoing efficacy assessment include physical exam; CT scans at screening , 
once between 3 – 4 weeks after completing Cycle 6, and in follow -up at specified time points; 
and PET scans at Screening , between Weeks 7 – 9 (after Cycle 3 but before Cycle 4) , and 
once 3 – 4 weeks after start of  Cycle 6.  
 
The treatment will be defined in Section  5, but in brief the  starting dosage level in the phase I 
trial will be:  
Dose level 1 (cycle is q21 days)  
 Lenalidomide 15mg po daily 1 – 14 
 Obinutuzumab 1000mg IV day 1, 8, 15 C1, day1 C2 -6 
 Cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2 IV on day 1  
 Doxorubicin 50mg/m2 IV on day 1  
 Vincristine 1.4mg/m2 (max 2mg) IV on day 1  
 Prednisone 100mg po daily on days 1 -5  
 
3.4 FOLLOW -UP PERIOD  
The Follow -up Period begins upon study treatment discontinuation for all subjects. This 
includes subjects who complete the full course of treatment, who di scontinue treatment due to 
progression or toxicity, as well as those who discontinue before progression to pursue a new 
anti-lymphoma / salvage therapy (chemotherapy, SCT, radiotherapy, etc.).  
 
3.[ADDRESS_251936] therapy for nearly 40 years. The dosing for lenalidomide is based on 
the previous lenalidomide + RCHOP trials. (60, 62, 68). The dosing for obinutuzumab will be 
based on the Gather Study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) (69): 1000mg IV on day 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, 
then on day 1 of cycles 2 – 6. 
 
The rationale for conducting a phase Ib trial portion is to confirm that there is no adver se 
increase in toxicity from the previous Obinutuzumab -CHOP and Rituximab -Lenalidomide -
CHOP trials. Based on the large number of patients treated on these similar trials, it is 
anticipated that the Phase Ib portion will be limited in size.  
 
Although there has been compelling data that lenalidomide may have increased activity in the 
ABC subtype of DLBCL, we will allow all patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL to enroll in this 
Protocol [ADDRESS_251937] scans will be obtained at 
screening , once between 3 – 4 weeks after start of  Cycle 6, and in follow -up at specified time 
points; and PET scans at Screening , between Weeks 7 – 9 (after Cycle 3 but before Cycle 4) , 
and once 3 – 4 weeks after start of  Cycle 6.

 42 5. TREATMENT PLAN  
This will be a single arm, single institution, open -label phase Ib/II clinical trial of lenalidomide, 
obinutuzumab, and CHOP to evaluate the safety and efficacy in subje cts with previously 
untreated CD20+ DLBCL.   
 
5.[ADDRESS_251940]  3+3 design will be employed. Three patients 
will be enrolled in the Dose Level 1 cohort with dosing as:  
 
Dose level 1 (cycle is q21 days)  
 Lenalidomide 15mg po daily 1 – 14 
 Obinutuzumab 1000mg IV day 1, 8, 15 C1, day1 C2 -6 
 Cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2 IV o n day 1  
 Doxorubicin 50mg/m2 IV on day 1  
 Vincristine 1.4mg/m2 (max 2mg) IV on day 1  
 Prednisone 100mg po daily on days 1 -5  
 
Drug dosing should occur at the above schedule unless it is not feasible due to 
patient travel delays, holiday schedule, or other unforeseen circumstance. In that 
event, the schedule may be modified for a therapeutic cycle to be between 20 
and 23 days (range of -1 day - +2 days). For obinutuzumab cycle 1 dosing, the 
day 8 and day 15 dosing can administered +/ -1 day if necessary for s imilar to 
above issues.  
 
If zero of the initial 3 patients experiences a dose limiting toxicity ( DLT, as defined below), an 
additional three patients will be treated at this dose level.  If 0 or 1 DLT is observed out of the 
total 6 patients treated at Dos e Level 1, then  Dose Level 1 will be selected for the Phase II 
portion of the trial and no further patients will be accrued to the phase Ib portion of the trial.  
 
The DLT evaluation period will be cycle 1. DLT  will be defined as grade ≥ 3 non -hematologic 
toxicity per NCI CTCAE 4.0 unmanageable  with aggressive supportive care  or toxicity resulting 
in a delay of over 7 days of cycle 2. The incidence of neutropenic fever will be carefully 
monitored, but will not be considered a DLT as neutropenic fever is know n to occur with R -
CHOP.  
 
If 1 out of the initial 3 patients develop s a DLT, an additional 3 patients will be treated at the 
same dose level.  If no more DLTs develop at this dose (i.e., 1 out of a total of 6 patients 
develops a DLT), Dose Level 1 will be s elected for the Phase II portion of the trial and no 
further patients will be accrued to the phase Ib portion of the trial.

  Version 1.4 April 5, 2018  
 
 
Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 43 At any given dose, if greater than 1 out of 3 patients or 1 out of 6 patients experience DLT, the 
dose level exceeds the MTD and 3 more patients will be treated at the next lower dose if there 
are less than 6 patients already treated at that dose.  
 
Lower dose levels are defined as:  
 
Dose level 0  
Lenalidomide 10mg po daily 1 – [ADDRESS_251941] dosing  
 
Dose level -1 
Lenalidomide 10mg po daily 1 – [ADDRESS_251942] dosing  
 
Dose level -2 
Lenalidomide 5mg po daily 1 – [ADDRESS_251943] been treated with less than 2 instances of DLT.  Given the history of good tolerance of 
lenalidomide with RCHOP (including 2 planned/ongoing Phas e III trials comparing RCHOP vs 
R2CHOP), and Obinutuzumab with CHOP, it is anticipated that a maximum of 15  will be 
enrolled in the phase Ib portion of the trial. The MTD identified in the Phase Ib portion of the 
trial will be selected as the recommended p hase II dosing (RP2D) for further evaluation in the 
Phase II portion of the trial  
 
The [ADDRESS_251944] the etiology of DLTs (e.g., 
addition of a specific prophylactic antibiotic as mandatory for all patients), the trial will resume 
at the previously determined MTD, with the same monitoring strategy as  detailed above.   
 
If the etiology of the increased DLTs in unknown or not correctable with a minor modification, 
the trial will resume at the next lower dosing level from the Phase Ib portion of the trial if 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_16310]. If the increased  DLTs are significant and 
unavoidable, the principle investigator may elect to end the trial before full enrollment is 
completed.  
 
6. CLINICAL  TRIA L MEDICATIONS  
6.1.1  Obinutuzumab  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Formulation  
Obinutuzumab is provided as a single -use vial.  Each vial contains a ste rile 
liquid formulation in a 50 -mL pharmaceutical -grade glass vial containing a 
nominal dose of 1000 mg of obinutuzumab (G3 material).  The formulated drug 
product consists of 25  mg/mL drug substance formulated in histidine/histidine -
HCl, trehalose, and po loxamer 188.  The vial contains 41 mL (with 2.5% overfill).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Storage  
The recommended storage conditions for the obinutuzumab drug product are 
between 2 C and 8C, protected from light.  Chemical and physical in -use 
stability for obinutuzumab dilutions in 0 .9% sodium chloride (NaCl) at 
concentrations of 0.2  − 20 mg/mL have been demonstrated for 24 hours at 
2C − 8C and an additional [ADDRESS_251945] should generally be used immediately.  If 
not used immediately, in -use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 
2C − 8C unless reconstitution/dilution has taken place in controlled and 
validate d aseptic conditions.  Obinutuzumab should not be frozen or shaken.  
Mix gently.  All transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic 
techniques.  Do not use an additional in line filter because of potential 
adsorption.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Preparation  
Obinutuzumab dr ug product intended for IV infusion is prepared by [CONTACT_210856] 0.9% NaCl.

withdraw and discard [ADDRESS_251946] it into the infusion bag (discard any unused 
portion of obinutuzumab left in the vial).  Gently invert the infusion bag to mix the 
solution.  Do not shake.  
Administration sets with polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, or polyethylene as 
product contact [CONTACT_26778], polypropylene, polyvinyl 
chloride, or polyethylene as product contact [CONTACT_210857].  Use of a port or peripherally inserted central catheter line is acceptable.  
Do not use obinutuzumab beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_177170].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosage and Administration  
Obinutuzumab administered by [CONTACT_210858] 6 cycles (21 -day cycle s): 
• On Cycle 1, Days 1,  8 and 15, 1000 mg of obinutuzumab will be administered.  
• On Cycles 2  − 6, Day 1, 1000 mg of obinutuzumab will be administered 
(see Table  Table  4) 
 
Obinutuzumab must  be administered in a clinical setting (inpatient or outpatient).  
Full emergency resuscitation facilities should be immediately available, and 
patients should be under close supervision by [CONTACT_210859].  Obinut uzumab should be given as a slow IV infusion 
through a dedicated line.  IV infusion pumps (such as Braun Infusomat Space) 
should be used to control the infusion rate of obinutuzumab.  Do not administer 
as an IV push or bolus.  After the end of the first in fusion, the IV line should 
remain in place for at least [ADDRESS_251947] 1 hour from 
the end of infusion; if no AEs occur after [ADDRESS_251948].

reactions as outlined below:  
• Cycle 1, Day 1, all patients req uire pre -medication with:  
– IV glucocorticoid: dexamethasone (20 mg) or methylprednisolone (80 mg) 
administered at least one hour prior to obinutuzumab infusion.  Hydrocortisone 
should not be used as it has not been effective in reducing rates of IRR.  
– An o ral acetaminophen (1000 mg) and an antihistamine such as 
diphenhydramine (50 mg) administered at least 30 minutes before starting each 
obinutuzumab infusion.  
• Cycle 1, Days 8 and 15 and Cycles 2 -6, Day 1:  
– All patients require pre -medication with oral acetaminophen (1000 mg) 
administered at least 30 minutes before starting each obinutuzumab infusion.  
– Patients who experience an IRR (Grade 1 or more) with the previous infusion 
will require pre -medication with an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine 
(50 mg) administered at least 30 minutes before starting each subsequent 
obinutuzumab infusion.  
– Patients who experience a Grade [ADDRESS_251949] 
lymphocyte counts of   25  109/L prior to the next treatment will require pre 
medicati on with IV glucocorticoid: dexamethasone (20 mg) or 
methylprednisolone (80 mg) administered at least one hour prior to 
obinutuzumab infusion.  Hydrocortisone should not be used as it has not been 
effective in reducing rates of IRR.  
 
Hypotension may be exp ected to occur during obinutuzumab infusions.  
Withholding of antihypertensive treatments should be considered for [ADDRESS_251950] hour after 
administration.  Patients at acute risk of hypertens ive crisis should be evaluated 
for the benefits and risks of withholding their hypertensive medication.  
For TLS prophylaxis, see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
 
If a patient expe riences any grade infusion reaction during infusion, adjust the 
infusion as outlined below:  
• Grade 4 (life threatening): Stop infusion and discontinue therapy.  
• Grade 3 (severe): Temporarily interrupt infusion and treat symptoms.  Upon 
resolution of symptoms , restart infusion at no more than half the previous rate 
(the rate being used at the time that the infusion reaction occurred) and, if 
patient does not experience any infusion reaction symptoms, infusion rate 
escalation may resume at the increments and in tervals as appropriate for the 
treatment dose.  
• Grade 1  − 2 (mild to moderate): Reduce infusion rate and treat symptoms.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Supportive Care  
Anti-emetics are required to be administered prior to each dosage of CHOP 
chemotherapy and may be administered with additional pre -medications given 
prior to obinutuzumab. However, the dosage and medication choice will not be 
mandated and will be at the discretion of the treating physician, but there will be 
suggested dosing on the order sets. Subsequent anti -emetics after start of a 
chemotherapy cycle will be given to as needed per the discretion of the treating 
physician.  
6.1.5  Pre-phase Treatment  
For subjects with bulky disease, systemic symptoms, compressive disease, elevated bilir ubin 
due to lymphoma, or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_210812], pre -phase treatment with 1 mg/kg/day 
prednisone, or equivalent, for a maximum of 7 days is permitted prior to beginning the 
Treatment Period, at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
In the case of  pre-phase corticosteroid treatment, there is no protocol specified definition of 
bulky disease. A washout period is not required; prophase treatment may be given, 
immediately followed by [CONTACT_210863], and then a corticosteroid taper is 
allowed if the treating physician feels indicated. However, the Screening PET, CT, lymph node 
biopsy, and bone marrow biopsy (and if applicable, also the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) should be 
completed before initiating corticosteroids.  
 
Pre-phase treatment with vincristine or any other chemotherapy is prohibited.

The investigator may prospectively choose to give local radiotherapy after study chemotherapy 
for the treatment of a particular site of bulky disease or a large m ass. In the case of 
consolidation treatment, bulky disease is defined as ≥ 7.[ADDRESS_251963] be determined during the Screening Period. In this case, 
the consolidation radiotherapy will not count as a treatment event for the EFS endpoint.  
 
If the investigator should decide at anytime after Cycle 1 Day 1 to give consolidation treatment, 
or to switch treatment to a different lesion, receipt of consolidation treatment will count as an 
EFS event.  
 
6.2 CONCOMI TANT AND EXCLUDED THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_5165]  
6.2.1  Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any prescription medications or over -the-counter preparations 
used by a patient between the 14  days preceding the study entry evaluation and the early 
study treatment termination visit/study treatment completion visit.   All concomitant medications 
should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the appropriate electronic Case Report 
Form (eCRF).  
 
Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone -replacement therapy, or other maintenance 
therapy should continue their use.  Effective contraception is required while receiving 
obinutuzumab  and/or lenalidomide .  For women, effective contraception is required to continue 
for  [ADDRESS_251964] dose of obinutuzumab  and/or lenalidomide .  For men, effective 
contraception is required to continue for  [ADDRESS_251965] dose of obinutuzumab  and/or 
lenalidomide . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prophylaxis for Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
All patients with peripheral blood lymphocyte counts of   25  109/L or bulky 
lymphadenopathy must receive prophylaxis for TLS prior to the initiation of study 
treatment.  This includes appropriate hydration consisting of a fluid intake of 
approximately 3 L/day starting [ADDRESS_251966] dose of obinutuzumab and 
admi nistration of allopurinol (300 mg/day orally) or a suitable alternative 
treatment starting prior to the first infusion of obinutuzumab (Cycle 1, Day 1).  All 
patients should then be carefully monitored during the initial weeks of treatment.  
Patients still  considered at risk for TLS because of persistently high tumor 
burden (i.e., peripheral blood lymphocyte counts   25  109/L) before the second 
and subsequent infusions of obinutuzumab should continue TLS prophylaxis 
with allopurinol and adequate hydration  until the risk is abated, as determined by 
[CONTACT_093].

 55 [IP_ADDRESS]  Venous Thrombosis:  
Based upon prior trial data, it will be required for all patients to receive either 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ( 81 – 325 mg PO daily) or another prophylaxis agent while on 
lenalidomide. Exceptions will be made if a patient has a previous history of 
significant bleeding or other condition which makes anticoagulation unsafe in the 
determination of the principle investig ator. 
The choice of VTE prophylaxis agent relies upon the investigator’s discretion 
and should be tailored to the subject’s individual risk/benefit profile by [CONTACT_210864], bleeding risk, and the quality of 
compliance with the VTE prophylaxis.

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
The maximum sample size for this phase Ib/II study is 59 with 15 for the phase Ib portion and 
additional 44 for the phase II portion.  The 6 patients treated at the MTD in the phase Ib portion 
will be included in the analysis for the phase II portion to re ach the sample size of 50 (6+44).  
The phase II trial will determine the complete response rate after completion of therapy at the 
recommended phase 2 dosing levels. The obinutuzumab -CHOP trial (Gather) found an ORR 
of 83%, and CR rate of 55%. It is hypoth esized that the combination of lenalidomide, 
obinutuzumab and CHOP should result in a CR rate of >75%. With  a sample size of 45, the 
study will have  a power of 0.[ADDRESS_251982] the difference between the  null hypothesis response 
rate of 0.55 and the alternat ive hypothesis response rate of 0.75 assuming a two -sided type I 
error rate of 0.05 . We would plan to enroll 50 patients in the phase II portion and MTD cohort 
of the of the Phase Ib portion of the trial to account for potential dropout or other issues 
impa cting our final numbers  for efficacy evaluation . 
 
9.2 PLANNED EFFICACY EVALUATIONS  
The planned efficacy evaluations will be defined by [CONTACT_210868]:  
9.2.1  Phase Ib:  
The primary endpoint of the phase Ib trial is not efficacy, but determination of the MTD . The 
patients treated at the MTD in the phase Ib component of the trial will be included in the 
efficacy analysis of patients treated in the Phase II trial.  
 
The MTD determination is defined in Section 5.1 
9.2.2  Phase II:   
The efficacy evaluation in patients treated at the MTD in phase Ib and in phase II po rtions of 
the trial will occur by [CONTACT_210869]/CT 
scans, as define d in Sections 7.4 and 8. 
9.3 METHOD OF ANALYSIS  
9.3.1  Clinical Outcomes Analysis:  
Summary statistics will be provided for continuous variables.  Frequency tables will be used to 
summarize categorical variables.  Logistic regression will be utilized to assess the effect of 
patient prognostic factors on the response rate and the toxicity rate.  The distribution of time -
to-event endpoints including overall survival and progression free survival will be estimated 
using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Comparison of time -to-event endpoints by [CONTACT_210870] -rank test.  Cox proportional hazard regression may be 
employed for multivariate analysis on time -to-event outcomes.  
 
Toxicity data will be summarized by [CONTACT_210871].  For the efficacy

  Version 1.4 April 5, 2018  
 
 
Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 64 endpoints, intend -to-treat analysis will be applied to  the eligible patients.  For the toxicity 
endpoint, per -treated analysis will be performed to include any patient who received the 
treatment regardless of the eligibility or the duration or dose of the treatment received.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase Ib:  
The primary objective s of p hase 1b are to determine the MTD  of lenalidomide, obinutuzumab, 
and CHOP . The secondary objectives are to determine the efficac y (complete and overall 
response rate) and tolerability .  Dose de-escalation will be guided by [CONTACT_38183] 3+[ADDRESS_251983] cohort of 3 patients will be treated at Dose Level 1 and evaluated for DLT (definition in 
section 5.1) at the end of the first cycle (21 days per cycle).   The algorithm is as follows:   (1) As 
this trial has a high expectation of dosing safety, dosing wi ll start at the anticipated MTD level 
(i.e., Dose Level 1) . At Dose Level 1, if 0 or 1 out of 3 patients experience s DLT, an additional 
3 patients will be treated in this cohort.   (2) If no more DLTs develop at this dose (i.e., < 2 out 
of a total of 6 pati ents develops a DLT), Dose Level 1 will be the MTD and used in the Phase II 
portion of the trial.   (3) At any given dose, if greater than 1 out of 3 patients or 1 out of 6 
patients experience DLT, the dose level exceeds the MTD and 3 patients will be treat ed at the 
next lower dose .  (4)  If 0 or 1 out of 3 patients experiences DLT, an additional 3 patients will 
be treated at this dose level.   (5)  If no more DLTs develop at this dose level, then the current 
dose level will be the MTD and used in the Phase I I portion of the trial.   Following the above 
scheme, MTD is defined as the highest dose level in which [ADDRESS_251984] been treated with 
less than 2 instances of DLT.   MTD will be used in the Phase II portion  of the trial.  
Given the prior tolerance of R2CH OP and Obinutuzumab -CHOP , it is anticipated that eligible 
number of patients are required for the phase 1b part will be a maximum of 15 patients, and 
possibly only six patients .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase II  
Once the MTD is determined, a planned 50  patients will be treated a t the RP2D (6 patients will 
be from the phase Ib who are treated at the MTD).  
 
To ensure treatment efficacy and patient safety, end of therapy complete  response rate and 
DLT at 1 cycle during the Phase II portion of the trial will be  monitored simultaneously using 
the Bayesian approach of Thall, Simon, Estey (71) as extended by [CONTACT_210872] (72). The 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_210817]-binomial distribution.  The trial 
will be stopped early if  
Pr (CR rate < 0. 55 |data) > 0.9 5 
or 
Pr(DLT rate > 0.30 | data)  > 0.9 5 
That is, the trial will be stopped early if there is more than a 9 5% probability that the CR rate is 
lower than 55% or if there is more than a 95 % probability that the DLT rate is higher than 30%. 
We assume that CR and DLT follow a prior distribution of beta (0. 55, 0.45) and beta (0.3, 0.7), 
Protocol [ADDRESS_251985] 10 patients.  The 
patient enrollment will be halted for interim toxicity look if the number of non -DLT required for 
continuing the trial to next stage has not been achieved , but will not be halted for interim  
efficacy look .

 66 9.3.2  Analysis Plan:  
Data analysis will be performed using SAS or R, as appropriate. The overall and complete 
response  rates, DLT rate, and OS/PFS rate at 1 year will be summarized by  [CONTACT_210873] 95% confidence interval. Patients who received at le ast one dose of the treatment drug 
will be evaluable for toxicity outcomes.  Toxicities will be summarized by [CONTACT_28805], by [CONTACT_210874]. The intent -to-treat patients will be used for the 
primary efficacy analysis; pat ients who are lost-to-follow up in the first [ADDRESS_251986] regression 
will be employed for multivariate analysis on time -to-event outcomes.  
9.3.3  Correlative Assay Analysis:  
The following correlative studies wi ll be performed in [CONTACT_210892], D r. Davis, or an MD 
Anderson Core  laboratory using the blood, serum, and biopsy samples .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  To determine whether obinutuzumab, lenalidomide, and CHOP 
enhance the frequency  and function of tumor -specific T -cells in the 
peripheral blood, the phenotype and func tion of T cells will be 
assessed as follows:  
Phenotypic studies for T cells. PBMC (1 x 105 per tube) will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_210875] 6 -color, 8 parameter 
FACS Canto (BD Pharmingen) after staining with a panel of antibodies 
in 2 separate tubes. Tube 1: PBMC will be stained with CD3, CD4, 
CD8, CD45RO, CD69, and PD -1 to determine the percentage of total  T 
cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, effector/memory (CD45RO+) T cells 
within each subset, activation status (CD69+) of T cells within each 
subset, and PD -1 expression within each subset. Tube 2: PBMC will 
be stained with CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD62L, CD2 7, CD127 and 
CCR7 to determine the percentage of effector memory T cells 
(CD45RO+CD27 -CCR7 -, CD62L -CD127+) and central memory T cells 
(CD45RO+CD27+CCR7+, CD62L+CD127+) within CD4+ and CD8+ T -
cell subsets. The absolute number of each of these T -cell subsets  in 
the peripheral blood of the patients will be calculated using the 
following formula: (absolute number of lymphocytes per l of blood on 
the CBC analysis) x (% of T -cell subset in lymphocyte gate).

subsets will be collected at each of the planned time points. Spaghetti 
plots will be used to show the biomarker measurements change 
overtime. Longitudinal analysis including mixed effects model for time -
dependent variables  will be performed . The percentage change for the 
biomarkers from baseline to the various time points will be calculated . 
The correlations among the percentage changes for diff erent 
biomarkers will be assessed by [CONTACT_210876]’s 
correlation coefficient. The association between the percentage 
change and patient’s clinical outcome such as complete and overall 
response will be evaluated. Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to test 
the difference in percentage change of biomarker between the 
response group and the non -response group. The percentage change 
will also be dichotomized into two categories (high vs. low) based on a 
cutoff point which will be determined after e xamination of the data.  
Fisher’s exact test will be used to assess the associations between the 
dichotomized variables for percentage change and clinical response.  
 
To evaluate changes in T -cell subsets by [CONTACT_210877] , lenalidomide, and CHOP  treatment at the 
different time points, we will perform a two -sided paired t -test or 
Wilcoxon signed rank test for the experiments proposed under [IP_ADDRESS] .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  To evaluate the mutational and gene expression data from RNA -Seq of 
tumor biopsy material, the following analyses will be performed. T he 
baseline biopsy will be evaluated with  RNA sequencing (RNA -
Seq) (73), in comparison with germline DNA, to determine gene 
expression, transloc ations, and mutations including those known to 
correlate with ibrutinib resistance (e.g., BTK, PLCγ2, MYD88 , 
CARD11, CD79A/B ).(18, 74-77) To att empt  correlat ion of GEP data 
with clinical responses to obinutuzumab , lenalidomide, and CHOP  by 
[CONTACT_210878] -responders, a regression analysis  will be performed . Data 
from RNA -Seq will be processed  using published methods, including 
standard quality assessments and R software packages. (73, 78, 79) 
Gene expression will be compared against the continuous variable of 
tumor regression percentage and/or changes in LymphoSIGHT values, 
and ana lyzed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (80) to 
evaluate for processes in the tumor cells and microenvironment which 
are associated with response to R -CHOP, but have an unknown

perform RNA -Seq on biopsies of residual disease, and potentially 
perform focused deep sequencing of DNA from residu al tumor, PBMC

Minimum Residual Disease (MRD) w ill be determined by [CONTACT_210879]. MRD statu s of subjects will be assessed by  [CONTACT_210880] -based 
method and compared with results from imaging based assessments. 
Correlation  of MRD status from both types of assessment with clinical 
outcomes will be analyzed. In order  to evaluate how well the MRD 
assay pre dicts clinical outcome, its sensitivity and specificity in  
predicting disease progression will be calculated.  
 
The sensitivity and specificity of MRD in  predicting disease progression 
is described in the table  below.  
 
  

Protocol [ADDRESS_251987] (IMP) or other protocol -imposed 
intervention, regardless of attribution . 
This includes the following : 
• AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with DLBCL that were not 
present prior to the AE reporting period.  
• Complications that o ccur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as cardiac catheterizations).  
• If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with 
medication washout, no treatment run -in, or other protoco l-mandated intervention.  
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_13655] -specified AE reporting period.  
 
10.1.2  Serious Advers e Events  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experien ce that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatien t hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may req uire 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive

result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
(21 CFR 312.32).  
 
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious 
adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be repo rted as an 
SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_195696], IND 
Office.  
 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE 
must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes a nd procedures outlined 
in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board 
Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and 
Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expect ed or unexpected, 
must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of 
knowledge of the event).  
 
10.2 METHODS FOR ASSESSING AND RECORDING SAFETY VARIABLES  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs, th at are observed or 
reported during the study, are collected and reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), appropriate IRB(s), Celgene , and Genentech, Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND 
Safety Reports).

administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, w hichever is earlier. 
After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study 
treatment.  
 
10.2.[ADDRESS_251989], or other means will be 
reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start 
and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected rela tionship to 
obinutuzumab, lenalidomide, or CHOP  (see following guidance), and actions taken.  
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:  
Yes 
There is a plausible temporal relationsh ip between the onset of the AE and administration of 
obinutuzumab, lenalidomide, or CHOP , and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_4677]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a

  Version 1.4 April 5, 2018  
 
 
Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 72 known pattern of respo nse to the [study drug}; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon 
discontinuation of the [study drug} or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -
challenge.  
No 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the [study drug} (e.g., preexist ing 
medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or 
the AE has no pla usible temporal relationship to obinutuzumab, lenalidomide, or CHOP  
administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_251990] dose of study  drug).  
 
Expected AEs are those AEs that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert s or current 
Investigator Brochure s.  
 
Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the Package Insert s or current Investigator’s Brochure s 
or not identified.  This include s AEs for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with 
the description in the Package Insert s or Investigator’s Brochure s.  For example, under this 
definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the Package Insert s or Investigator’s 
Brochu res only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Second Primary Malignancies  
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
serious adverse events regardless of the treatment arm the subject is in. This includes any 
second primary malignancy, regardless of causal relationship to obinutuz umab, lenalidomide, 
or CHOP , occurring at any time for the duration of the study, from the  time of signing the 
informed consent document ( ICD) for at least [ADDRESS_251991] be considered an “Important Medical Event” if no other serious criteria apply; 
these events must also be documented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF (i.e., AE and 
SPM CRF) and subject’s source do cuments. Documentation on the diagnosis of the second 
primary malignancy must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (e.g., 
any confirmatory histology or cytology results, X -rays, CT scans, etc.).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancies  
Pregnancies and suspec ted pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age 
or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject  is on lenalidomide, or within 
[ADDRESS_251992]’s last dose of lenalidomide, are considered immediately reportable  
events. Lenalidomide  is to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected 
pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately 
by [CONTACT_64823]. The female subject sh ould be 
referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist, preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for 
further evaluation and counseling.  If a female patient becomes pregnant while receiving 
obinutuzumab  and/or lenalidomide  or within one year after the last dose of obinutuzumab

Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 73 and/or lenalidomide , or the partner of a male patient becomes pregnant while receiving therapy 
or within three months of completing therapy, a report should be completed and expeditiously 
submitted to Genentech  and Celgene , Inc.   
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety and Genentech, Inc. immediately about the outcome of the 
pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the 
Investigator should report the abno rmal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets 
any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety and 
Genentech, Inc.  immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledg e of the e vent using the SAE Report Form.  
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_251993] to 
causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero  exposure to the  lenalidomide  should also be reported to Celgene Drug 
Safety and Genentech, Inc.  immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 
hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the e vent using the SAE Report Form.  
If a female part ner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the 
male subject taking lenalidomide or obinutuzumab should notify the Investigator, and the 
pregnant female partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider immediately.  
 
10.3 PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, AND REPORTING SERIOUS ADVERSE 
EVENTS  
• All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related  to the study drug, 
must have a written report submitted within 24 hours  (next working day) of knowledge of 
the event to t he Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
 
• Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety 
reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB .  
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protoco l-specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_251994] returned to baseline, progression of the eve nt has stabilized, 
or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
 
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_251995] be reported to the IND Office. This may include the 
deve lopment of a secondary malignancy.

  Version 1.4 April 5, 2018  
 
 
Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 74 Reporting to FDA:  
 
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_79438] (Safety Project 
Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_210820], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol 
guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.  
 
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_251996] medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs.  
Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual  signs 
and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and 
elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs  and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the  time of reporting, it is 
acceptable to report the information that is currently available.  If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should be reported as follow -up information.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reportin g period (see Section  10.2.1 ), 
regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parties.  When recording a death, 
the event or condition  that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as 
the single medical concept.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the 
time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisti ng medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and surgical history.  A preexisting medical condition should be 
re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only if the  frequency, severity, 
or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When reporting such events, it is 
important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_188215] (e.g., “more frequent headaches” ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210821].  If a patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as 
a result of  an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be 
Protocol [ADDRESS_251997] the heart condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15429]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210822]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210823]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210824].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Post-Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a patient has completed 
or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior obinutuzumab exposure.  If the 
investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a congen ital anomaly in a 
subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient who participated in the study, this should 
be reported as an SAE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Reconciliation  
The investigator  agrees to conduct reconciliation for the product.  Genentech and Celgene  will 
agree to the reconciliation periodicity and format, but agree at minimum to exchange monthly 
line listings of cases received by [CONTACT_15481].  If discrepancies are identified, the 
investigator  and Genentech will cooperate in resolving the discrepancies.   The responsible 
individuals for each party shall handle the matter on a case -by-case basis until satisfactory 
resolution.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)  
AEs of special interest (AESIs) are defined as a potential safety problem, identified as  a result 
of safety monitoring of the Product.  
 
The following AEs are considered of special interest and must be reported to the Sponsor 
expeditiously (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for reporting instructions) irrespective of regulatory 
seriousness criteria:  
  
• Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS - all grades)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Investigators must report all SAEs to Genentech and Celgene within the timelines described 
below.  The completed MedWatch/case report should be faxed immediately upon completion 
to Genentech Drug Safety at:

Serious AE reports that are unrelated to obinutuzumab will be transmitted to Genentech within 
thirty (30) calendar days of Awareness Date.  
 
 
 
Additional reporting requirements  to Genentech include the following:  
• Any reports of pregnancy following the start of administration with the obinutuzumab and 
within the follow -up period (for female patients within one year after the last dose of 
obinutuzumab or the partner of a male pati ent within three months of completing therapy) 
will be transmitted to Genentech within thirty (30) calendar days  of the Awareness Date.  
• All non -serious obinutuzumab AEs originating from the study will be forwarded Genentech 
quarterly . 
 
Expedited Reporting  by [CONTACT_210881], Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness 
of events of being related to lenalidomide based on the Investigator Brochure.  In the United 
States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be reported in an 
expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.

Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab with CHOP for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma  
 77 Serious adverse events (SAE) are defined above.  The investigator must inform Celgene in 
writing using a Celgene SAE form or MEDWATCH 3500A form of any SA E within [ADDRESS_251999] be completed and supplied to Celgene by 
[CONTACT_31950] 24 hours/[ADDRESS_252000](s).  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the 
adverse event or laboratory values received after the report) must be documented on a follow -
up report.  A final  report to document resolution of the SAE is required.  The Celgene tracking 
number and the institutional protocol number should be included on SAE reports (or on the fax 
cover letter) sent to Celgene.  A copy of the fax transmission confirmation of the SA E report to 
Celgene should be attached to the SAE and retained with the patient records.  
 
Note: Investigators should also report events to their IRB as required.  
 
MedWatch 3500A Reporting Guidelines  
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect medication information, 
the report should include the following information within the Event Description (item 5) of the 
MedWatch 3500A form:  
• Protocol description (and number, if assigned)  
• Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome if known  
• Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics  
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the AE to each investigational product and 
suspect medication  
 
Follow -Up Information  
Additional information may be added to a previously sub mitted report by [CONTACT_69167]:  
• Adding to the original MedWatch 3500A report and submitting it as follow -up 
• Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow -up with the original 
MedWatch 3500A form  
• Summarizing new informa tion and faxing it with a cover letter including patient identifiers 
(i.e., D.O.B. initial, patient number), protocol description and number, if assigned, brief AE 
description, and notation that additional or follow -up information is being submitted (The 
patient identifiers are important so that the new information is added to the correct initial 
report)  
Occasionally Genentech may contact [CONTACT_15483], clarification, or

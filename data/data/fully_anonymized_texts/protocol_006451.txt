NUMBER OF SITES  One (1)  
  RATIONALE  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major public health concern, 
affecting over 16 million American s. AUD i s a highly disabling 
disease associated with many  physi cal and psychiatric co-morbidities . 
Current AUD interventions include pharmacologic treatment  and 
behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; however, these are not very effective, having 
high rates of relapse soon after initial successful treatment.  Therefore, 
new, more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347778].  
Preclinical and clinical research has shown that stimulation of the 
ulnar sensory  nerve via acupuncture can inhibit dopamine signaling in 
the brain’s mesolimbic circuit that is responsible for drug craving and 
reward . While acupuncture is an excellen t adjunct procedure in 
treatment centers, it also has limited patient acceptability as it requires 
patients to  seek treatment in clinic.  Therefore, TheraNova  has 
developed the Empower Neuromodulation System , a portable, safe, 
easy-to-use neuromodulation device that stimulates the ulnar sensory  
nerve  to enable a convenient and acceptable therapy to treat AUD . 
The overall goal of this study is to conduct a 3-week  pi[INVESTIGATOR_347779], effectiveness , and usability of the 
Empower Neuromodulation System in AUD patients.  
  STUDY DESIGN  This is a n open -label, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27041].  
  PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE   Safety:  Evaluate safety of the Empower Neuromodulation 
System treatment via device -related adverse events and 
participant -reported side effects.  
 Effectiveness:   Evaluate the effectiveness of Empower 
Neuromodulation System treatment for reducing alcohol 
consumption (via self-reported daily consumption ) over a [ADDRESS_432187] -12-1176 -01, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_347775], MD

OBJECTIVES  The secondary study objectives are the following:  
 Effectiv eness: Evaluate the effectiveness of the Empower 
Neuromodulation System treatment for reducing alcohol 
craving (via self -reported craving intensit y (VAS responses) ) 
over a 2 -week treatment phase and compared to a pre -treatment 
baseline phase .  
 Usability:  Evaluate the usability of the Empower 
Neuromodulation System via the System Usability Survey 
(SUS).

of 12 or more on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of

DOSE, AND ROUTE 
OF 
ADMINISTRATION  Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation of the ulnar  nerve at the 
palm  with the Empower Neuromodulation System  
During the Treatment Phase (Weeks 2-3 of the study), the participant 
will self -administer a treatment session twice per day. Each treatment 
session consists of a total of [ADDRESS_432190], DOSE 
AND ROUTE OF 
ADMINISTRATION  No control treatment will be used in this study.  However, each 
participant  will serve as his/her own control via data collection during 
the Baseline Phase (Week 1 of the study). For each participant , 
treatment effects during the Treatment Phase (Weeks 2 and 3) will be 
compared with the Baseline Phase.  
DURATION OF 
PARTICIPANT  
PARTICIPATION 
AND DURATION OF 
STUDY  Participant s will be on study for up to 35  days 
Screening:  up to 7 days  
Baseline Phase:   5-11 days  
Treatment  Phase :  11-17 days  
The total duration of the study is expected to be 9 months . Eight 
months for participant  recruitment and 1 month  for final participant  
follow -up. 
STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  The primary effectiveness endpoint will be change in alcohol 
consumption  as a result of treatment. We will compare  averages of 
daily drinking for the final week of the Treatment Phase (Week 2) vs. 
the week of the Baseline Phase via a paired t -test. 
Rationale for Number 
of Participant s As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the sample size is not based on  a formal power 
calculation. Based on sample sizes for previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_347780], we 
aim to recruit 25 participants to obtain a meaningful cohort for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_347781].

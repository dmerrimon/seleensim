 Page 4 of 18  Revised : December 1, 2018  2.0 Objectives*  
There is significant and growing evidence that adherence to a ketogenic diet may 
be an effective behavioral intervention for AD.  While previous studies have 
identified the basic mechanisms and interactions of a ketogenic diet with ApoE and lipid and glucose metabolism, feasibility testing in diverse human samples remains in the earliest phases of translational science. The current project will translate these findings into a new behavioral intervention to prevent AD using the NIH ORBIT model for early phase translational behavioral studies.  This model includes Phase 1a: Define the Intervention, Phase 1b: Refine the Intervention, Phase 2a: Proof of Concept, and Phase 2b: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116].
22 Phase 1a of this model (Defining the intervention) is underway.  
We have already recruited over [ADDRESS_239995] and Identification of Neural Correlates  
The existing literature suggests a link between the ApoE genotype and risk for AD—and further implicates  a ketogenic diet in ameliorating this risk.  One of the primary 
goals of the current study is to extend this work to neural measures linked to both ApoE genotype and ad in a diverse population. To this end, the current proposal involves the use of neuropsychological testing, electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess neurophysiological risk for ad and potential changes in neural measures post-intervention.  
Aim 1 :  Refine. Use a team science approach to optimize and develop a protocol to 
promote adherence to a [ADDRESS_239996] that the use of a team science and patient -driven approach will 
enhance adherence (80%) and retention (100%) in the Proof of Concept stage.  
Aim 2 :  Proof of Concept.  Assess the feasibil ity, acceptability, and preliminary 
effects of implementing a ketogenic dietary intervention for older adults at high 
risk for AD.  Participants, aged 60-75 (N=50), will complete in -person 
neuropsychological assessments to assess for MNCD status, and saliva samples will be 
collected to assess for ApoE genotype.  We will recruit 10 participants (5/10 ApoE €4+) 
who meet criteria for MNCD to complete a feasibility study assessing adherence to a ketogenic diet. Hypothesis 1:  We expect that interdisciplinary collaboration and a 
patient -centered approach will increase acceptability to a ketogenic diet, as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_1629] 80% dietary adherence rate.  Hypothesis 2: We expect 
preliminary evidence that adherence to the ketogenic diet will improve cognitive performance on memory tasks, and the diet may have a greater impact on cognitive scores for ApoE €4+ participants.  
Aim 3 :
 Examine the intervention effect on neural correlates of AD and ApoE €4. 
Partic ipants selected for the intervention (N=10) will complete pre- and post-

 Page 5 of 18  Revised : December 1, 2018  intervention EEG assessments to identify treatment effects. Hypothesis 1: Ketogenic 
Diet will reduce P300 latency and increase P300 amplitude Hypothesis 2: The impact of the ketogenic diet on P300 latency and amplitude will be larger among 
ApoE €4+ carriers.   
 COVID -19 Update: Pre - intervention assessments have mostly been completed. Post-
intervention EEG assessments have been suspended; however, if COVID-[ADDRESS_239997] cognitive data over the phone and will not include EEG 
data.  
Aim 4 : We will examine whether variability in the p300 relates to cognitive 
measures, and if it better differentiates ApoE genotype and the impact of a ketogenic diet than cognitive measures.  In conjunction with the in-person 
neuropsychological assessments and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (n=50), we are proposing to add an EEG assessment at this phase to assess neural risk factors for ad. For this portion, we are interested in adding an additional 25 low- risk p articipants to the sample as a 
comparison group in order to identify and confirm neural correlates of MNCD and ApoE €4 status. Hypothesis 1: MNCD will have increased latency and reduced amplitude p300 relative to healthy controls. Hypothesis 2: among MNCD, ApoE €4 genotype will be associated with increased latency and reduced amplitude p300.  
 COVID -19 Update: All phase [ADDRESS_239998] to change.  
 
1.0  Background*  
 
AD is the sixth l eading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002],1 and minority older 
adults are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_201323] .2 For 
example, the Alzheimer’s Association3 reports that African Americans are twice as 
likely to develop AD, while Hispanic Americans are approximately one and a half times more likely compared to Caucasians. Existing research demonstrates that genetic risks 
such as the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) €[ADDRESS_239999] illuminated a wide range of risk and resiliency factors for late -life cognitive decline for 
both minority and Caucasian populations.  
For example, it is well accepted that carriers of an ApoE €4 allele, compared to 
carriers of €2 and €[ADDRESS_240000] risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_201314] ;9 yet, having 
an ApoE €4 allele is not sufficient to develop AD. The expression of this genetic risk is 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page 6 of 18  Revised : December 1, 2018  influenced by a wide range of environmental risk factors, ranging from stressful life 
events to diet and exercise.10-11 A ketogenic diet, in particular, holds promise for 
addressing deficiencies linked to the ApoE €4 allele .9,12-13   
ApoE is involved in lipid metabolism, and the ApoE €4 allele is not as efficient as other 
variants; thus, researchers have indicated that genotype should be taken into account when applying a dietary intervention for AD.
[ADDRESS_240001] demonstrated that a high -
glycemic diet (e.g., high sugar/carbohydrate) is associated with accumulation of amyloid plaques in cognitively normal adults.
15 A die t high in healthy fats and low in 
carbohydrates (i.e., ketogenic) induces the creation of ketone bodies, which can be processed by [CONTACT_201324]. Further, ketone supplements, specifically, appear to improve cognitive functioning, even when a normal diet is maintained.
16-[ADDRESS_240002], however, is weakened in individuals with an ApoE €4 allele;17-18 ketone 
supplements do not account for the potential benefits of healthy fats and reduced carbohydrate intake on APOE functioning – an effect only  diet change may produce. 
The ketogenic diet shows promise in addressing problems in lipid metabolism and may circumvent inefficient glucose metabolism , which indicates diet as a potent 
therapeutic intervention for cognitive functioning.

19 
Less attention has been given to the potential therapeutic effects of a ketogenic diet in individuals with mild neurocognitive disorder (MNCD) and AD. A small feasibility study demonstrated that the ketogenic diet can successfully improve cognitive scores in older adults with mild AD (N=10 completers) across a 3-month span, although all four patients with modera te AD dropped out before completing the trial.
[ADDRESS_240004] shown small, but positive effects in improving cognitive functioning scores in individuals with AD without an ApoE €4 allele.
16 These 
findings demonstra te that ketosis is generally beneficial and such a trial is feasible; 
however, implementation may be challenging in patients who are already diagnosed with AD. Further, given the evidence of an interaction between ApoE and ketone bodies
9,20,21, feasibility  studies and future clinical trials should experimentally assess the 
cognitive effects and neural correlates associated with a ketogenic diet in humans.   
In sum, there is significant and growing evidence that adherence to a ketogenic diet 
may be an effect ive behavioral intervention for AD.  While previous studies have 
identified the basic mechanisms and interactions of a ketogenic diet with ApoE and lipid 
and glucose metabolism, feasibility testing in diverse human samples remains in the earliest phases of translational science. The current project will translate these findings into a new behavioral intervention to prevent AD using the NIH ORBIT model for early phase translational behavioral studies.  This model includes Phase 1a: Define the Intervention, Phase 1b: Refine the Intervention, Phase 2a: Proof of Concept, and Phase 2b: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116].
22 Phase 1a of this model (Defining the intervention) is underway.  We 
have already recruited over [ADDRESS_240005] teamed with a community clinic to modify an existing ketogenic group intervention for application in research with older individuals.  The current study builds on both the basic science and existing 
PROTOCOL TITLE:

The existing literature suggests a link between the APOE genotype and risk for AD —
and further implicates a ketogenic diet in ameliorating this risk.  One of the primary 
goals of the current study is to extend this work to neural measures linked to both APO E 
genotype and AD in a diverse population. To this end, a key component of the current 
proposal involves the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess neurophysiological risk for AD and potential changes in neural measures post -intervention. This is a 
significant addition insofar as neural measures derived from EEG are ideally suited to 
assess neurocognitive risk factors linked to APOE and MNCD – and are an appropriate 
target for assessing the impact of a ketogenic diet. Further, EEG assessments may not be 
prone to the biases inherent in many neuropsychological tests, making it ideal for assessing more diverse populations.  
In previous EEG studies, AD has been associated with reduced amplitude of the P300 
event -related brain potential
23-24, as well as dela yed latency of the P300.23-[ADDRESS_240007] and commonly studied event -related brain potentials (ERPs). It 
is typi[INVESTIGATOR_201315], in which participants must 
count or respond to an infrequentl y presented ‘target’ stimulus and ignore a more 
frequently presented ‘standard’ stimulus.  The P300 is evident as a parietally -maximal 
positive deflection that peaks a few hundred milliseconds after stimulus onset.  A shorter latency of the P300 has been a ssociated with faster decision -making and quicker 
information processing
26, whereas a larger P300 amplitude has been associated with 
better cognitive abilities (i.e., attention, memory).  The P300 effects seen in AD reflect 
delayed information processing a nd reduced cognitive abilities – and appear irrespective 
of task modality.23  
Importantly, the ApoE genotype has also been associated with deficits in the P300:  ApoE €[ADDRESS_240008] that abnormalities of the P300 may be a risk 
factor  for AD, and may further mediate the association between ApoE €4 and AD risk.  
One primary aim of the current grant application is to replicate these associations in our 
sample —to demonstrate that the ApoE €[ADDRESS_240009] pi[INVESTIGATOR_201316] a ketogenic diet would ‘normalize’ P300 abnormalities – and if it 
would do so more among ApoE €4 gene carriers.  Our working hypothesis is that a 
reduced and pr olonged P300 will be characteristic of ApoE €4, and that a ketogenic diet 
will normalize these deficits.  If confirmed, these data would provide mechanistic data that P300 abnormalities could be a novel target for a ketogenic diet intervention to 
reduce ri sk for AD.

Proof of Concept.  Assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of 
implementing a ketogenic dietary intervention for older adults at high risk for AD.  Hypothesis 1: We expect that interdisciplinary collabora tion and a patient -centered 
approach will increase acceptability to a ketogenic diet, as evidenced by [CONTACT_1629] 80% dietary adherence rate. Hypothesis 2: We expect preliminary evidence that adherence to the ketogenic diet will improve cognitive performance on mem ory tasks, and the diet may

weight and vitals assessment, food and ketosis log , and self -evaluation of their 
adherence and obstacles to adherence). These 1 -hour meetings will provide  additional 
information about adher ing to a ketogenic diet, identifying barriers and solutions to 
adherence, and providing group support and accountability. These meetings will 
provide time for participants to ask questions and to discuss any adverse reactions to the diet. These meetings will also provide the researchers an opportunity to complete

Participants will be compensated $50 each week for their time and for the purchase of any additional groceries required for dietary adherence. Thus, participants will be compensate d $[ADDRESS_240013]-assessment appointments around the intervention to provide additional data on neuropsychological and neurophysiolog ical outcomes associated with the 
diet. Participants will be compensated an additional $ 75 for the pre- assessments 
(RBANS , EEG,  & blood draw) and $[ADDRESS_240014]-assessment (RBANS, blood 
draw, and EEG), and $50 for completing the 1-month follow-up.  
 COVID -19 Updates : The dietary intervention will consist of weekly group virtual 
meetings, which will take place via HIPAA -compliant Zoom. The meetings will be led 
by [CONTACT_976], Julia Sheffler, Ph.D. and a nurse practitioner who will still be mailing informational handouts and ketone test strips to the participants prior to the meetings , so 
participants may request clarification if needed . Blood sample collection, weight, and 
vital assessments are suspended in accordance with the recent restrictions. However, if these restrictions are lifted  in time , we will proceed with these final blood sample, 
weight, and vital assessments in -person, but on an individual one-on-one basis . We may 
request that participants provide their most recent standard bloodwork from their primary care physician  at the start of the intervention ; however, this will remain optional. Weekly 
food logs and paper assessments will be mailed to the participants  in addition to weekly 
compensation checks. If COVID -[ADDRESS_240015]-intervention assessments will be adapted into Qualtrics or telephone interviews.   
4.0 Procedures Involved* 
Screening call:  
Participants who completed the previous phase of the study and indicated that they would like to be contact[CONTACT_201325] s will be first screened based on 
APOE e4 status. Participants who meet all eligibility criteria based on the survey, genetic testing, and neuropsychological testing (i.e., meet criteria for MNCD, 5/10 APOE e4+, 5/10 APOE e4-, no exclusionary health conditions or significant dietary restrictions based on nurse practitioner’s discretion, and interest in completing a dietary intervention). The call screening script is attached.  
Pre-intervention Assessments: 
All participants will complete two  pre-intervention assessment appointments. 
These appointments will be scheduled within [ADDRESS_240016] intervention group meeting. This appointment will include: consenting, brief neuropsychological testing ( The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page 10 of 18  Revised : December 1, 2018  Neuropsychological Status  - RBANS), and the emotion battery of NIH toolbox. 
The total meeting should last approximately [ADDRESS_240017] approximately 1-hour. 
Participants will be compensated $75 total for both appointments. 
COVID -19 Updates: If in-person restrictions are lif ted by [CONTACT_201326]-
week intervention, post-intervention EEG and follow- up assessments will be 
completed on an individual basis , while we continue to take necessary safety 
and hygiene precautions outlined in the original protocol. Neuropsychological 
assessments will be completed via telephone using a battery of pre- standardized 
assessments.  Otherwise, the EEG post- intervention assessments will not be 
completed, and all assessments will be completed via HIPAA -compliant Zoom 
or telephone. 
Given that all participants have already enrolled in the trial, we will also 
complete individuals calls to these participants to explain the changes in the protocol and to obtain verbal consent to continue in the study. We will test each participants capability to use the video conferencing software prior to the first group meeting.  
Intervention:  
Week 1 : Participants will be asked to come to the center approximately 1 hour 
prior to the group meeting to complete pre-intervention health assessments. These assessments will  include a blood draw for comprehensive metabolic 
profiles (completed by a certified phlebotomist), a weight and body composition assessment, basic vitals (blood pressure and heart rate), and a health profile screener (see attached). Participants will also  be given a food diary and ketone 
test strips for recording level of ketosis and net carbohydrate intake throughout the intervention trial. Of note, weight, vitals, and the health profile screener will be administered at each weekly meeting to monitor part icipant well-
being.   
The first group meeting will consist of a 1.5 hour informational session to provide participants with materials and to introduce them to the diet and diet plan in detail. The meetings will be led by a certified Nurse Practitioner via video conference. The PI, Julia Sheffler, will be present in-person as well to help facilitate the group. Participants will be given an opportunity to ask questions and complete and to provide feedback about the session. Participants will be encouraged to track their diet until the next session, and to slowly begin reducing their carbohydrate intake. Participants will be compensated $50 for their time and to purchase any additional groceries. 
A second group meeting will be scheduled later in the same week in order to 
give participants an opportunity to attempt reducing carbohydrate and increase healthy fat intake across multiple days. This meeting will be offered to provide 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page 11 of 18  Revised : December 1, 2018  additional assistance and for participants to ask questions or voice concerns 
after attempting the diet on their own. This meeting will be semi-structured, with the goal of providing support.  
Week 2 -4: After the first week, the following meetings will consist of [ADDRESS_240018]-intervention assessments. Each week, participants will be compensated $50, and will be asked to record ketone level on a daily basis.  
Week 5 -6: The group meetings will continue as usual in the final weeks; 
however, du ring this time, participants will be scheduled to complete post-
intervention neuropsychological testing. Testing will be completed during the 
active intervention in order to assess individuals who are actively in ketosis. In the final session, participants  will be asked to come early or stay late to 
complete a follow -up blood draw (by a certified phlebotomist). T he final 
session will conclude with qualitative feedback about the intervention program in order to inform future studies.  
Follow-up intervention Assessments: All participants actively engaged in the 
intervention by [CONTACT_5875] [ADDRESS_240019] (RBANS) and the NIH toolbox. The second visit will involve completing a follow-up EEG, which will involve pi[INVESTIGATOR_201317]. Each appointment will last approximately 1 -hour. Part icipants 
will be compensated $75 total for both appointments.

Participants will be compensated $50 for completing this appointment. 
COVID -19 Updates: If COVID -[ADDRESS_240021] clarification if needed. Blood sample collection, weight, and vital assessments are suspended in accordance with the recent restrictions ; however, 
if these restrictions are lifted, we may proceed with these assessm ents in -person

standard bloodwork from their primary care physician; however, this will remain optiona l. 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page 12 of 18  Revis ed: December 1, 2018  Week 1: Prior to the first meeting, p articipants will be mailed the ketone test 
strips , informational handouts  and food diar ies to monitor carbohydrate intake 
over the course of the intervention. They will complete  a 1.5- hour virtual group 
meeting, whic h will act as the initial informational session. A second meeting 
will be scheduled with participants within this first 7- day period to give 
participants the opportunity to begin reducing carbohydrate intake  and to ask 
follow -up questions . This meeting will retain the original goals of providing 
support and giving the participant the opportunity to ask questions after 
attempting the diet on their own.  
Week 2 -4: After the first week, subsequent meetings will be [ADDRESS_240022] ketone levels on a daily 
basis.  
Week 5 -6: These final one -on-one HIPAA -compliant Zoom meetings will 
collect qualitative feedback as previously mentioned and wi ll omit the blood -
drawings.  
The follow -up intervention assessments and 1- month follow ups will continue 
as planned, but will continue with online and telephone -based assessments 
rather than in -person.  
If COVID -[ADDRESS_240023] - and 
follow -up intervention assessments and 1- month follow ups will be conducted 
as individual, one -on-one in- person assessments.  
5.0 Data and Specimen Banking*  
Blood samples will be collected in a phlebotomy lab at the Center for 
Translational Behavioral Science. Samples will be labeled and identified only by [CONTACT_31258]. These samples will be used to assess comprehensive metabolic profiles (CMPs)  of participants. Samples will be stored  temporarily in 
the phlebotomy lab and then will be transported via medical transport cooler to the lab on FSU campus for analysis. If immediate analysis is not possible, samples will be stored in a –80 F freezer at the Translational Science Laboratory at the College of Medicine in a locked suite until analysis is possible. Once results of the CMPs are returned, these will be coded and stored with other participant data (described below).   
Specimens will not be released to participants or entities outside the study. If the Nurse Practitioner on the study identifies concerning findings in regards to the participants’ comprehensive metabolic profiles or other health data , she will 
notify the study team’s M.D. consultant for a clinical decision on recommendati ons. If necessary, p articipants will be notified that follow -up with 
a physician may be indicated, and they will be given the option to sign a release of information (see attached) to have this information shared with their physician for follow -up. Finding s will be faxed directly to their physician.  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page 13 of 18  Revis ed: December 1, 2018  6.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects*  
Participants will not receive diagnostic feedback about their performance on the 
RBANS, NIH toolbox, or EEG results. If participants request information about their performance  on the memory tasks, the researchers will provide general 
feedback about whether the participant performed the same, better, or worse at follow -up compared to baseline. Participants will be told that fluctuations in 
performance are normal and are not necessarily indicative of a problem.  
If the Nurse Practitioner identifies concerning findings in regards to the participants’ comprehensive metabolic profiles or other health data. Participants will be notified that follow -up with a physician may be indicated , and they will

Our goal  is to recruit 10 participants to complete the intervention, as this is a small 
feasibility study.  
 
11.0 Recruitment Methods  
Participants will be recruited from a previous screening study (IRB approved: 
STUDY00000213), where they provided consent to be contact [CONTACT_201327]. Participants will be called by [CONTACT_201328] a brief screening (see attached script).  Participants who qualify based on this telephone screener will be scheduled for the initial assessment appointment.  
Participants will be excluded from the study if they identify an unstable chronic medical condition, such as kidney/renal disease or failure, congestive heart failure, heart disease, heart rhythm irregularities, severe lipid dysfunction or deficiencies, unstable gallbladder disease, Chron’s disease, ulcerative colitis or other serious GI disorder, including history of ostomy, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes requiring insulin, chronic auto- immune disorders, active psychosis or 
serious unstable psychiatric conditions, or any other significant surgery or 
chronic health condition that may interfere with their ability to alter their diet, as determined by a certified nurse practitioner. Further, participants who report using the foll owing medications will be excluded: insulin, diuretics, 
antipsychotics, MAOIs, narcotics, immunosuppressant medications, or others at the nurse practitioner’s discretion.  
12.0 Withdrawal of Subjects*  
Participants will be withdrawn from the study based on the i nvestigator’s 
discretion. The consultant leading the intervention is a registered Nurse Practitioner who will assist in monitoring the participants’ vitals each week. Participants who experience significant adverse responses to the diet (as determined by a nurse practitioner or MD) will be withdrawn from the intervention. If a participant is withdrawn due to health, they will be provided partial compensation and provided the option of completing follow -up 
assessment appointments.   
13.0 Risks to Subjects*  
Intervention Risks: We are only recruiting healthy individuals with no unstable chronic  medical conditions for this diet (e.g., gallbladder problems, Type 1 
diabetes). Thus, primary risks associated with changing diet may include,

 Page 15 of 18  Revis ed: December 1, 2018  gastrointestinal upset (i .e., bloating, diarrhea, gas, and constipation) , change in 
weight, headache, and fatigue. Participants will be closely monitored by a nurse 
practitioner on a weekly basis to assess any adverse response to the diet. If a 
significant adverse response is reported or identified, the team will consult the MD consultant on the team for a  clinical decision.  
EEG Risks: T here is a small possibility of mild skin irritation (redness) where 
the electrode contacts the skin. This is rare and usually temporary.  
14.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects*  
A goal of the current study is to assess whether a ketogenic diet may be beneficial for memory in older adults. Previous research has demonstrated that a low-carbohydrate diet has multiple benefits on cognitive functioning and other 
health factors in older individuals. Thus, participants will be provided wit h a 
supportive environment for making this diet change. Participants may 
experience improvements in their cognitive status and will be closely monitored 
by [CONTACT_201329].  
15.0 Data Management* and Confidentiality  
In regards to the data analytic plan, we  will complete descriptive analyses of the 
sample and correlational analyses of outcomes. Regression, ANOVA, and t -
tests may be used.

Data from these physical copi[INVESTIGATOR_201319], which will be password protected and stored in encrypted locations. All identifiable participant data will be stored separately in a password protected d ocument. 
Data will be connected to an ID number rather than participant information.  
Data will be entered by a research assistant and checked by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_201320].  
If data or specimens require transport from one study location to another (I.e., innovation park to college of medicine), these will be transported only by [CONTACT_201330].  
16.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects*  
Weight and basic vitals assessments and the health profile screener will be administered at each weekly meeting to monitor participant well- being. These 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_201331]. She will determine if additional follow -up or referral is warranted. If the Nurse 
Pract itioner identifies a potential adverse response, she will notify the M.D. 
consultant for further review and a clinical decision on course of action. The IRB will be notified in the case of any adverse event.  
COVID -19 Updates: Although we may not be able t o conduct the w eight and 
basic vitals assessments  if COVID -19 restrictions are not lifted by [CONTACT_201332] , we will be asking participants to disclose any discomfort or adverse 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page 16 of 18  Revis ed: December 1, [ADDRESS_240028] to access existing patient records 
covered by [CONTACT_201333] . All information collected during the study will be 
at the participants’ discretion.   If a participant reports feeling discomfort at completing a task or item, they will be given the option to skip the item or task. Participants will be reminded that their participation is voluntary and there is no penalty for leaving the study.  
  
18.0 Compensa tion for Research -Related Injury  
Engaging in a monitored low -carbohydrate diet should pose no more risk to 
participants than encountered in daily life. Similarly, risks for the EEG portion of the study are minimal and clearly laid out in the consents and i n other 
sections of this protocol. We state the following about compensation:  
“Medical Treatment: FSU, its agents, or its employees do not routinely compensate for or provide free care for human subjects in the event that any injury results from participation in a research project. If you become ill or injured as a direct result of participating in this study, contact [CONTACT_201334]. If you have insurance, your insurance company may or may not pay for these costs. If you do not have insurance , or if your insurance 
company refuses to pay, you will be billed. Funds to compensate for pain, expenses, lost wages and other damages caused by [CONTACT_201335].”  
 
19.0 Economic Burden to Subjects  
Participants will be required to supply their own transportation to and from 
appointments. No other economic burden to participants is expected. 
 
20.0 Consent Process 
We will follow the “SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091).” 
Participants will receive a separate consent form for the interv ention portion of

the study that a participant no longer has capacity to provide consent to 
participate, a brief cognitive assessment will be completed (I.e., the Montreal Cognitive Assessment & judgment questions) to assess whether their cognitive  
status has precipi[INVESTIGATOR_201321]. If a participant is identified as no longer having capacity to participate, they will be removed from the study and 
provided with community referrals.   
 
COVID -19 Updates: Participants will be re -consented and provided w ith 
updated information regarding study procedures as they adjust to follow recent 
restrictions. They will be given the option to reconsider their participation given 
these changes now, as well as throughout the study’s completion. However, 
participants will be made aware that if COVID -[ADDRESS_240030] with participants unless we obtain PPE, and we will take additional safety and cleaning measures for all surfaces and participant areas.

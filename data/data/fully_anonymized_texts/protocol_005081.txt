novel therapeutic regimens. Valproic acid (VPA), a well -characterized drug used in children with 
seizures since the 1970’s, was recently identified as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor a nd has 
been shown to have anti -tumor activity in multiple tumor types, including high -grade gliomas. Pre -
clinical studies have shown that VPA administered as a single agent inhibits growth of orthotopic 
xenografts derived from malignant gliomas. In additio n, VPA has been shown to enhance the anti -
tumor activity of both radiation and chemotherapy. In a recently completed Children’s Oncology 
Group phase 1 study of valproic acid in children with recurrent solid tumors, a partial response was 
observed in a chil d with a refractory brainstem glioma and another patient with a refractory 
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Bevacizumab (Avastin), a monoclonal antibody against vascular 
endothelial growth factor, has also shown promising activity against multiple tumor type s, including 
high-grade gliomas. Two recent studies of the combination of bevacizumab with irinotecan 
demonstrated an improvement in the 6 -month progression free survival (PFS) of adults with recurrent 
GBM. A subsequent abstract reported at the 2008 Americ an Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting 
showed that adults randomized to receive bevacizumab alone had statistically identical 6 -month PFS 
versus subjects that received the combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan. As expected, there were 
fewer adverse ev ents in the bevacizumab alone arm versus the combination arm.  We therefore propose 
a phase 2 trial to evaluate a novel treatment regimen for children with newly diagnosed high grade 
gliomas that includes administration of daily oral VPA during radiation t herapy, followed by i.v. 
bevacizumab administered every two weeks plus daily oral VPA. The primary aims of this study are: 
1) to determine the anti -tumor activity of this regimen as measured by 1 - year and 2 -year event -free 
survival (EFS) rate, and 2) to e valuate the toxicities of this regimen. The secondary aims are to 
characterize several biologic pathways in malignant gliomas, including quantification of DNA repair 
proteins and markers of tumor angiogenesis, and to correlate these parameters with radiogr aphic 
response and EFS.  
 
TREATMENT SCHEMA  
With the exception of patients with brainstem gliomas, all patients should have the maximal surgical 
resection that can be safely performed prior to study entry. Submission of frozen tumor is strongly 
encouraged. P lease coordinate with neurosurgeons and pathologists in advance to ensure that an 
adequate tumor specimen is obtained  (see section 7.0 ). After recovery from neurosurgery, all 
patients will start valproic acid and radiation therapy.

Pre-XRT Phase  
Valproic acid (VPA) will be started at 15 mg/kg/day divided tid up to [ADDRESS_1192411] adequately recovered from their definitive surgical resection or 
biopsy, but no later than 30 days after surger y.  Specific guidelines for VPA administration are 
provided in Section 5.2.  
 
During XRT Phase  
Radiation should begin within 30 days from surgery or radiographic diagnosis, whichever is the later 
date. VPA will be continued daily without interruption durin g radiation therapy. VPA doses will be 
adjusted in increments of 5 mg/kg/day every 3 -5 days to achieve and maintain trough concentrations 
between 85 to 115 mcg/ml (See Section 5.2.2 and 5.2.3). During this time, patients will receive 
standard radiation the rapy as outlined in Section 9.0.  
 
Post XRT Phase  
Patients will continue to receive VPA as during XRT. For patients that required discontinuation of 
VPA during radiation, they will not resume VPA until start of maintenance therapy.  If necessary, 
patients who had delays in XRT (e.g., secondary to schedule holidays or the need to have a new mask 
made) will complete their radiotherapy to the total prescribed protocol dose.  
 
Maintenance Therapy  
Maintenance therapy will begin 11 weeks after the initiation of ra diation therapy. Patients will 
continue VPA daily during the 4 -week break and throughout maintenance therapy. All patients will 
start bevacizumab, 10 mg/kg iv every two weeks, at the start of maintenance therapy (See Section 5.3). 
In the absence of unaccep table toxicity or disease progression, patients will continue to receive 
protocol treatment for a maximum total duration of two years (including the XRT phase).

1.2 Secondary Aims  
1.2.1 To quantify proteins related to histone deacetylation (histone H3 and H4 
acetylation, HDAC 1 and 2), NHEJ (Ku70/Ku80, DNA -PK) and HRR (Rad51, 
BRCA1/2) pat hway, tumor angiogenesis (VEGF, VEGF receptor 2), and tumor 
hypoxia (CD31, CA9, hypoxia -inducible factor 2 ) by [CONTACT_856488]/or at later time points are available.  
 
1.2.2 To perform IHC studies of the molecular markers outlined in 1.2.1 if only 
paraffin -embedded tumors are available.  
 
1.2.3 To measure NHEJ activity in PBMCs b efore treatment and after 2 weeks of 
VPA and radiation.  
 
1.2.4 To measure HDAC2 level and histone acetylation in PBMCs before treatment 
and after 2 weeks of VPA and radiation.  
 
1.2.5 To quantify MGMT and PARP activity by [CONTACT_856489] d iagnosis and/or at later time points, if available.  
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_1192413] a dismal prognosis. Although a Children’s Cancer 
Study Group (CCG) trial (CCG -943) showed a promising 5 -year EF S of 46% when 
prednisone, CCNU, and vincristine (PCV) were combined with radiation therapy (1), 
this result was not duplicated by a subsequent CCG -945 trial. The CCG -945 trial 
showed that PCV, when combined with rad iation therapy, produced a 5 -year EFS of 
16% and 28% for children with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic 
astrocytoma (AA), respectively. Furthermore, a more intensive chemotherapy regimen 
(eight -drug-in-one regimen) combined with radiation produ ced nearly identical clinical 
Page 8 of 95 
outcomes (2, 3) . Because of the promising results from a trial of temozolomide and 
radiation therapy in adults newly diagnosed with GBM (4), a similar trial was 
conducted through COG (study ACNS0126). The final results of ACNS0126 are 
pending, but a preliminary analysis showed that children with GBM in this trial had a 1 -
year EFS of 36%, nearly identical to the 1 -year EFS of 32% seen in CCG -945 (5). 
 
Children with brainstem gliomas also have dismal outcomes. A recent review of 22 
clinical trials in children with brainstem gliomas showed that only 92 out of 940 children 
survived, with no evidence that children in recent trials sh owed any improved EFS or 
overall survival (OS) compared to those in older series (6). In those ch ildren whose 
tumors were biopsied, the majority (153 out of 229 samples; 67%) were high -grade 
gliomas (6). Numerous clinical trials involving hyperfractionated radiation (7-10), 
chemotherapy (8, 10 -14) or biologic agents (7, 15, 16 ), and myeloablative regimens with 
stem cell rescue (17, 18)  uniformly failed to improve EFS or OS compared to historical 
series. Collectively, these trials showed dismal median EFS (5 -8.8 months), median OS 
(8-12 months), and 2 -year survival (5 -15%) in children with brainstem gliomas (6). 
 
2.2  Histone Deacet ylase (HDAC) and Human Cancers  
The lack of improvement in clinical outcome for children with high -grade gliomas and 
brainstem gliomas from trials conducted in the last two decades highlight the urgent need 
for novel therapeutic strategies. Recently, HDAC i nhibitors have demonstrated 
promising activity against various human cancers (19, 20) . Nucleosomes, the basal unit 
of chromatin, are composed of DNA coils wrapped around a core of histones with 
lysine -rich amino ter minal tails. The positive charge of the amino tails of histone attracts 
the negatively charged DNA, and this interaction partly regulates the chromatin structure 
and gene expression (19). Histone acetyltransferase ( HAT) transfers an acetyl moiety 
from acetyl -CoA to the lysines on the amino tails and neutralizes the positive charge of 
the histones, leading to decreased affinity for DNA, relaxation of chromatin, and 
transcriptional activation (19, 21) . HDAC removes the acetyl groups and restores the 
negative charge, leading to chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression (19, 22) .  
 
Dysregulation in histone acetylation has been impl icated in the development of several 
human cancers (19, 20) , and alterations in the acetylation status of specific lysines have 
been associated with human cancers as well (23). It is hypothesized that aberrant histone 
acetylation leads to inappropriate transcriptional repressions and maintenance of the 
transformed states of human tumors. HDAC inhibitors are hypothesized to reactivate 
expressions of critical pathways that are a bnormally silenced during tumorigenesis, and 
indeed treatment of multiple human tumor cells with HDAC inhibitors resulted in cell 
cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation (19, 20) . 
 
2.3  Rationale for VPA, an HD AC Inhibitor, in Pediatric High -Grade Gliomas  
VPA, an anti -convulsant used in children for over 30 years, was recently found to inhibit 
HDAC (24). Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that VPA has in vitro  and in vivo  
activity against several human cancers (24), and clinical trials of VPA in adult and 
pediatric malignancies are in progress.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_1192414] medulloblastoma (25, 
26). Anti -glioma activity of VPA has also been shown in several studies (24, 27 -32).  In 
addition, other HDAC inhibitors, including trichostatin, MS -275, and suberoylanilide 
hydroxamic acid (SAHA) are also active against malignant glioma (33-36). 
 
Clinical Studies of VPA in Patients with CNS Tumors  
In one retrospective analysis of adults with newly diagnosed GBM who underwent 
radiation therapy followed by [CONTACT_11553], overall survival (OS) was compared 
amongst patients not taking any anti -convulsant (group A), those taking VPA (group B), 
or those on enzyme -inducing anti -convulsants (EIAE; group C). The OS of group A and 
B were 11.6 mont hs versus 13.7 months, and this difference, while not statistically 
significant, was a noteworthy trend (37). Patients on VPA had a statistically significant 
improvement in OS (13.7 months) versus those on EIAE (10. 8 months, p = 0.042).  
 
A COG phase 1 study of VPA (ADVL0419) in children with recurrent/progressive solid 
tumors, including brain tumors, was recently completed. One out of three children with 
brainstem gliomas had a partial response (PR) that was sustaine d for 3 months. Another 
patient with a GBM (out of two children with high -grade gliomas) had a PR of 5 months 
duration (Su JM et al, unpublished results). The trough VPA concentrations in these 
responding patients ranged from 75 -110 mcg/ml. In a German tri al, a child with a 
progressive GBM after radiation and chemotherapy achieved a CR for 12 months while 
maintaining a VPA trough concentration of 160 mcg/ml, but treatment was stopped 
because of somnolence, and the tumor recurred after drug discontinuation (38). In 
treatment arm C of the German HIT -GBM trial, [ADDRESS_1192415] been recently reported as long -term 
survivors at 4.5, 4.95, and 5 years from time of diagnosis (39). 
 
There appears to be encouraging preliminary clinical data that support further studies of 
VPA as a novel agent in high -grade gliomas. However, given the non -durable responses 
observed  with VPA as a single agent in children with high -grade gliomas, it is possible 
that the potential therapeutic value of VPA would be augmented if combined with 
radiation and/or other drugs. Pre -clinical studies have indeed shown that VPA enhances 
radiation  effect in high -grade gliomas, and additional studies also suggest that VPA 
inhibits angiogenesis in human cancer models (see discussion below).  
 
VPA and Other HDAC Inhibitors Enhance Radiation Effect  
We have shown that VPA enhanced the anti -tumor activity  of radiation against two 
medulloblastoma cell lines by 1.6 to 2.7 fold (Li XN et al, unpublished data). Other 
investigators have also confirmed that VPA (40-43) and other HDAC inhibitors (44-49) 
can enhance the radiation effect against various human cancer cell lines, including 
malignant glioma (40, 41, 44 -46, 48)  in vitro . Camphausen et al. (41) reported that VPA 
enhanc ed the in vivo  radiation response of two subcutaneous xenografts of malignant 
gliomas, and Entin -Meer et al. (50) showed that another HDAC inhibitor (AN -9) 
Page 10 of 95 
combined with radiation significantly delayed tumor growth in mice with subcutaneous 
glioma xenografts.  
 
These studies identified that pre -treatment with VP A or other HDAC inhibitor followed 
by [CONTACT_856490]70, Ku80, and DNA -PK in the non -homologous end -joining (NHEJ) pathway and 
BRCA1/2 and Rad51 in the homologous recombination repair (HRR ) pathways. Since 
radiation is thought to exert its anti -tumor effect by [CONTACT_193388] -stranded DNA 
(dsDNA) breaks, and dsDNA breaks are repaired by [CONTACT_439206], it has 
been hypothesized that the radiation -enhancement effect of VPA and othe r HDAC 
inhibitors are partly mediated by [CONTACT_856491]. In all the pre -
clinical studies examining the radiosensitizing property of VPA and other HDAC 
inhibitors, optimal radiation enhancement was observed when HDAC inhibition 
preceded radiation by [ADDRESS_1192416] of VPA  
Our previous studies demonstrated that VPA treatment led to in vitro and in vivo  
inhibition of angiogenesis in medulloblastoma (25, 26) . Other pre -clinical studies also 
showed that VPA suppressed angiogenesis in various human cancers by [CONTACT_856492], inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation, and decreasing 
neovascularization (51-54). These pre -clinical studies suggest that a combination of VPA 
and an anti -angiogenesis agent may be a complementary approach in CNS tumors.  
 
VPA Induces Differentiation of Tumor and Stem Cells  
Our pre -clinical  studies showed that VPA treatment led to neuronal and glial 
differentiation in medulloblastoma cells (25, 26) . Additional studies also showed that 
VPA promoted differentiation of various neuronal progenitor cells (32, 55 -58). The 
differentiating effect of VPA on other normal or cancerous stem cells has also been 
reported (59-61), including differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cell s in two clinical 
trials (62, 63) . Since the quiescent cancer stem cell has been hypothesized to be resistant 
to radiation and chemotherapy, VPA -induced differentiation of the high -grade glioma 
stem cell may render them more susceptible to treatment.  
 
2.4  Rationale for Bevacizumab in High -Grade Gliomas  
Angiogenesis and High -Grade Gliomas  
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent endothelial cell mitogen and 
inducer of vascular permeability. VEGF plays a critical role in glioma angiogenesis, as 
its expression and protein level are elevated in GBM tumor cells and in tumor 
endothelial cells, but not in the normal brain (64-66). Bevacizumab, a humanized 
monoclonal IgG1  antibody against the human VEGF -A isoform and its proteolytic 
fragments, has been shown to decrease vascular permeability and increase apoptosis in 
intracranial xenografts of human glioblastoma in SCID mice (67).  
 
Bevacizumab, either as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents, 
has been extensively studied in multiple clinical trials in more than 8,000 adults with 
various cancers (68-71). The addition of bevacizumab to various chemotherapy agents 
Page 11 of 95 
improved the PFS and overall survival (OS) in adults with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(trial AVF2107g and E3200), non -small cell lung cancer (trial E4599), and metastatic 
breast cancer (trial E2100; see Bevaci zumab Investigator Brochure).  
 
Clinical Trials of Bevacizumab in Adults with Recurrent High -Grade Gliomas  
Two recent reports showed promising clinical outcomes in adults with recurrent 
malignant gliomas after combined bevacizumab and irinotecan treatment. In a phase II 
study, bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and irinotecan (125 mg/ m2 in patients not on EIAE) 
were given every 2 weeks, and responses were seen in 60% (14 out of 23) of patients 
with GBM and in 67% (6 out of 9) of patients with AA (72). In a follow up study, in 
which additional patients with GBM were recruited, and the treatment regimen was 
modified (bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 21 days, and irinotecan 125 mg/m2 weekly for 
four weeks repeated every 6 weeks), a respon se rate of 57% was observed (20 out of 35 
patients with GBM), and the 6 -month PFS was 46% (73). Response rate between the first 
and second group of patients was nearly identical, suggesting that increased dose -
inten sity of bevacizumab and/or irinotecan did not significantly improve tumor response. 
These results represent a significant improvement compared to historical 6 -month EFS 
of < 30% and response rate of < 20% in adults with recurrent GBMs.  
 
In a phase II, ran domized, non -comparative clinical trial, Genentech compared the 
clinical outcome and toxicities of adults with recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab 
alone versus those who received bevacizumab and irinotecan (74)(Table 1). The median 
OS and 6 -month PFS were statistically identical in both groups of patients, while those 
who received bevacizumab alone experienced lower incidences of various toxicities 
(Table 1). These results are consisten t with prior clinical trials of irinotecan, whether as a 
single agent (75-81) or in combination with other chemotherapy agents (82-84), in adults 
with recurrent malignant gli omas that showed limited response rates from 0 to 15% and 
suggested that irinotecan has minimal activity in high -grade gliomas.

Clinical Trials of Bevacizumab in Children with Cancers  
In a recently completed COG phase I study of bevacizumab in children with recurrent 
solid tumors (no patients with CNS tumors were included), n o DLTs were observed in 
18 patients (85) who received up to 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and no hemorrhage or 
thrombosis were seen. Currently, there is an ongoing PBTC trial (PBTC022) of 
bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 wee ks) and irinotecan (125 mg/m2 every 2 weeks) in 
children with progressive malignant glioma, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma.  
 
2.5  Rationale for Combining Radiation, VPA, and Bevacizumab  
VPA has been used in children since the 1970’s, can be taken orally w ith nearly 100% 
bioavailability, has a long half -life of 9 -20 hours in children, passes through the blood 
brain barrier effectively (86, 87) , and can be given chronically with well -characterized, 
acceptable toxiciti es. These biochemical, pharmacokinetic, and clinical properties make 
VPA an attractive agent for pediatric CNS tumors. Several pre -clinical studies have 
demonstrated VPA’s activity against malignant gliomas, and encouraging responses in 
children with malig nant gliomas and brainstem gliomas were observed in ADVL0419 
and HIT -GBM. Additional studies also showed that VPA enhances the effect of radiation 
against malignant gliomas. Therefore, we hypothesize that combining VPA with up -front 
radiation is a novel ap proach worthy of investigation in children with newly diagnosed 
high-grade gliomas and brainstem gliomas. In both ADVL0419 and HIT -GBM, patients 
with recurrent tumors who have received prior radiation and chemotherapy tolerated 
trough VPA concentrations be low 110 mcg/ml without DLTs, suggesting that combining 
VPA with radiation in newly diagnosed patients should be well tolerated. VPA has also 
been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and promote differentiation of neural progenitor and 
cancer stem cells. With rec ent encouraging responses to bevacizumab in adults with 
recurrent GBM, the combination of the anti -glioma and anti -angiogenic effects of VPA 
and bevacizumab represents a promising approach in children with high grade and 
brainstem gliomas. Because VPA and bevacizumab have few overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685] ( see 
section 3.1 and 3.2 ), we do not anticipate additive or unexpected toxicities in combining 
VPA and bevacizumab.  
 
2.6  Proposed VPA Dosing and Targeted Trough Concentration  
In HIT -GBM (39), serum trough VPA concentrations in 23 patients averaged 99 mcg/ml 
(range 52 -175 mcg/ml), and no grade 3 or 4 DLTs were reported. Three patients had 
somnolence , one patient had difficulties in concentration, one patient had 
thrombocytopenia, and a patient had anemia (all grade 1 or 2). In the COG phase I study, 
ADVL0419, two patients experienced grade -3 somnolence with trough VPA 
concentration between 100 and 15 0 mcg/ml. No DLT was seen in six subsequent patients 
whose trough concentration was maintained between 70 -110 mcg/ml (Su JM et al, 
Page 13 of 95 
unpublished data). With a starting dose of 15 mg/kg divided tid, all six patients achieved 
and maintained trough concentratio n > 75 mcg/ml within the first two weeks.  
 
Based on pre -clinical data demonstrating that the minimal anti -CNS tumor concentration 
of VPA is > 0.6 mM (~100 mcg/ml), whether as a single agent (25-30) or as an enhance r 
of radiation activity (40, 41) , we propose to maintain VPA trough concentrations as close 
to 100 mcg/ml as possible. Due to variability in timing of trough sampling and VPA 
assay, which is estimated to be 10 -15%, we propose to maintain VPA trough 
concentrations between 85 -115 mcg/ml (100 +/ - 15 mcg/ml) for initial patients.  
 
2.7  Prognostic Markers For Predicting Response and Survival in High -Grade Gliomas  
In adults with newly diagnosed GBM receiving temozolomide and radiation, it was 
shown that those with methylated promoter of the MGMT (O6-methylguanine -DNA 
methyltransferase) DNA -repair gene in their tumors had improved clinical outcomes 
compared to those with absence of MGMT promoter methylation (88). Such a 
correlation of MGMT promoter methylation and/or MGMT activity with improved 
clinical outcome in children with high -grade gliomas has not been confirmed yet.  
 
In the two clinical trials of bevacizumab and irinotecan in adults with progressive 
malignant gliomas (72, 73) , semi -quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies of 
VEGF, VEGF receptor 2, CD31 (surrogate marker for vascularity), hypoxia -inducible 
carbonic anydrase 9 (CA9) , and hypoxia -inducible factor -2a were performed in 45 tumor 
specimens. High VEGF level was associated with increased likelihood of radiographic 
response, and high CA9 level was associated with poor survival outcome (89). Since we 
will be incorporating bevacizumab into the proposed maintenance chemotherapy, these 
molecular parameters should also be studied and correlated with clinical outcome.  
 
Because several pre -clinical studies have documented that VPA enhancement  of 
radiation effect was associated with decreased levels of DNA repair proteins in the 
NHEJ and HRR pathways, we will also determine the levels of these DNA repair 
proteins in the untreated tumors and correlate them with clinical outcome. We will also 
quantify NHEJ activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before and after 2 
weeks of VPA and radiation to measure VPA’s potential inhibition of double -stranded 
DNA break repair. In addition, we also propose to study pre -treatment poly(ADP -ribose) 
polymerase (PARP) activity in pediatric high -grade gliomas, since PARP is a critical 
enzyme for activating both single stranded and double -stranded DNA break repair (90). 
 
Several pre -clinical studies have shown that  inhibition of HDAC2 appears to be critical 
for various aspects of HDAC inhibitors’ anti -tumor effect, including chromatin 
decondensation and remodeling, transcriptional activation, and induced histone 
acetylation (91-94). Subsequent clinical trials have confirmed that baseline expression 
of HDAC2 in PBMCs (as surrogates for tumor specimens) correlated directly with 
increases in histone H3 and H4 acetylation after HDAC inhibitor treatment (92, 95 -97). 
Therefore, baseline and post -treatment HDAC2 level in PBMCs may be an additional 
surrogate marker for measuring VPA ’s biologic effect in tumors.

2.8  Rationale for Amending Eligibility Criterion Regarding Intra -Tumoral 
Hemorrhage  
 Because of bevacizumab’s mechanism of action, intra -tumoral and/or intracranial  
hemorrhage was a potential concern with earlier clinical trials. With available published 
data, it is reassuring that the rate  of intra -tumoral/intracranial  hemorrhage is qui te low, 
and revising or current eligibility criteria to include  patients with asymptomatic intra -
tumoral hemorrhage, in a patient population that has a significant incidence of intra -
tumoral hemorrhage at the time of diagnosis, prior to initiation of any s urgery or other 
treatment, with few effective treatments available, is a reasonable option. Final data 
from the phase II clinical trials of 163 adults with recurrent GBM receiving 
bevacizumab, either alone or in combination with irinotecan, showed a rate o f 
intracranial hemorrhage of 2.4 (bevacizumab alone) and 3.8% (bevacizumab and 
irinotecan); patients with stable intra -tumoral/intracranial hemorrhage, regardless of 
size of hemorrhage, were eligible for this trial  (98). A follow up clinical trial, in which 
125 adults with newly diagnosed GBM received bevacizumab, temozolomide, and 
radiation immediately after initial tumor resection, included patients with grade 1 
(asymptomatic) intracranial hemorrhage prior to study  entry and showed rate of 
intracranial hemorrhage to be less than 1% (1 out of 125 patients) (99). In a recent 
pediatric phase II clinical trial, 31 children with either high -grade glioma or DIPG 
received bevacizuma b and irinotecan, and patients with pre -existing and stable intra -
tumoral hemorrhage were eligible for study participation; 4 patients experienced 
asymptomatic grade 1 CNS hemorrhage.  The currently open Children’s Oncology 
Group phase II clinical trial for  high-grade gliomas (ACNS0822), which includes 
bevacizumab during and after radiation therapy, also allow patients with pre -existing 
and stable CNS hemorrhage to participate in the trial.  
 
 Of the twenty seven children who have been enrolled onto our clini cal trial, two patients 
experienced grade -1 CNS hemorrhage and another patient had a grade -2 hemorrhage, 
all occurring at the time of tumor progression. In a patient population with dismal 
prognosis and few effective treatment options, we feel that, in lig ht of the published 
adult and pediatric data and our trial experience to date, it is reasonably safe to include 
patients with asymptomatic, stable  intra-tumoral or intracranial hemorrhage < [ADDRESS_1192417]. Ben Carcamo will serve as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_856448], El Paso, which will be 
added as a member of the consortium.

3.1.8  Drug Interactions  
 VPA has documented interactions with multiple anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_23698], and some of the 
severe toxicities of VP A, such as fatal hepatitis or hyperammonemia 
encephalopathy (see section 5.6.8 and 5.6.9), are associated with young children 
(age < 24 months) taking multiple anti -convulsants. Therefore, the use of other 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_856449].  
 
Other drugs w ith documented effects on VPA metabolism include acyclovir, 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_856450] , carbapenem antibiotics (imipenem, meropenem), 
cholestyramine, chlorpromazine , isoniazid, macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, 
azithromycin, erythromycin), and rifampin. If  any of these drugs need to be 
administered  after a patient has achieved the targeted VPA concentration, 
then twice weekly VPA trough concentration, CBC, and liver function tests 
should be monitored for at least 2 consecutive weeks (longer if cli nically 
indicated).  
 
VPA has documented effects on the metabolism of amitriptyline, nortriptyline, 
clonazepam, diazepam, nimodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], tolbutamide, tricyclic anti -depressants, 
 
Page 16 of 95 
warfarin, and zidovudine. Patients on protocol therapy who are also taking those 
medications should be monitored closely for toxicities and/or therapeutic effects 
of those medications.  
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_1192418] common side effects are gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), 
dermatological (dry skin, rash), and neurological (somnolenc e, ataxia, blurred 
vision, emotional lability) in nature, which seldom require discontinuation of 
treatment. See Table 2 for a complete listing of known VPA toxicities.

transient and resolve after temporarily discontinuing VPA or dose reduction. In 
ADVL0419, of the 20 children who maintained trough VPA concentration 
between 100 -150 mcg/ml, two patients had grade 3 somnolence, which resolved 
in 48 hours after VPA was discontinued. Six subsequent patients received VPA 
to maintain trough concentration of 75 -100 mcg/ml, and none experienced > 
grade 3 CNS toxicities. In the HIT -GBM -C tre atment arm (39), of the 44 
children who maintained VPA concentration between 52 -175 mcg/ml, three 
patients experienced grade [ADDRESS_1192420] commonly associated with 
serum trough > 140 mcg/ml (100, 101) . Two large retrospective analyses 
showed that severe thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count < 5 0,000/mm3, 
was rarely observed at serum concentrations < 150 mcg/ml (102, 103) . There 
was no specific association between severity of thrombocytopenia and duration 
of treatment. Thrombocytopenia most commonly resolv es despi[INVESTIGATOR_856452] (104, 105) . In ADVL0419, only one patient experienced 
grade -4 thrombocytopenia, which resolved after reduction of the VPA dose to 
achieve a trough concentration < 100 mc g/ml. Seven instances of transient 
grade -1 and two of grade -2 thrombocytopenia occurred and all resolved without 
requiring drug discontinuation or dose reduction. In the HIT -GBM trial, only 
one patient had grade 2 thrombocytopenia.  
 
Anemia, neutropenia, an d lymphopenia are less common than thrombocytopenia 
in children receiving VPA, occurring in < 5% of patients. In ADVL0419, one 
grade [ADDRESS_1192421] been previously reported in  children on VPA (100) . 
 
Hepatic encephalopathy and hyperammonemia  
One of the most severe toxicity of VPA is fatal hepatic failure, estimated at an 
incidence of one in 33,000 adults and children (86, 106) . The syndrome is 
characterized by [CONTACT_856493], decreased fibrinogen, 
with or without hyperammonemia, followed by [CONTACT_856494], 
encephalopathy, and coma. Although there is no clear association with dose, 
duration, or serum drug concentration, children younger than [ADDRESS_1192422] risk, with a n estimated incidence of 1:600 (106)  to 1: 5000 (107) . 
Therefore, we will be excluding children younger than 2 years of age and 
strongly discourage the use or other concomitant anti -convulsants.  
 
Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with VPA  despi[INVESTIGATOR_856453], and in patients with unexplained lethargy, vomiting, and/or 
changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be 
considered (108) . Although th ere is no association with duration of treatment or 
serum VPA concentration, identified risk factors include multiple anti -
convulsants, carnitine deficiency, and urea cycle or other metabolic disorders. 
Discontinuation of VPA and supportive care, including  carnitine 
supplementation, are the recommended treatments (109, 110) . 
 
Pancreatitis  
Another potentially fatal toxicity of VPA is pancreatitis. The incidence of 
pancreatitis in children taking VPA is unknown; a rece nt retrospective review in 
the English literature of all 33 cases of pancreatitis in children taking VPA 
identified 9 fatal cases, with no association between pancreatitis and the dose or 
serum concentration of VPA (111) . We will exclude any patient with a prior 
history of pancreatitis and/or abnormal lipase/amyl ase levels from this trial.  
 
Tetratogenicity  
There is an estimated 1 -2% incidence of neural tube defects in babies of mother 
taking VPA (86), so all female patients of child -bearing age should have a 
negative urine pregnancy test prior to enrollment.  
 
3.2  Bevacizumab (AvastinTM, rhuMAb VEGF)  
 
3.2.1  Description and molecular weight  
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti -VEGF antibody, 
consisting of 97% human and 3% of murine amino acid sequences. The agent is 
composed of human IgG framework and murine an tigen -binding 
complenmentarity -determining regions. Bevacizumab blocks the binding of 
Page 19 of 95 
VEGF to its receptor, resulting in inhibition of angiogenesis. Bevacizumab’s 
molecular weight is approximately 149,000 daltons.

3.2.6  Bevacizumab -specific toxicities  
The major adverse events associate d with bevacizumab are listed below. Please 
refer to the Investigator Brochure for detailed description of all toxicities.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion -related reactions  
Infusion reactions with bevacizumab are uncommon (< 3%) and rarely 
severe (0.2%). Infusion reacti ons may include rash, urticaria, fever, 
rigors, hypertension, hypotension, wheezing, hypoxia, or 
bronchospasm. Anaphylaxis precautions should be observed during 
study drug administration.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypertension  
An increased incidence of hypertension has b een observed in adults 
treated with bevacizumab, with an estimated incidence of 20 -30% 
across trials.  Grade [ADDRESS_1192427] included hypertensive crisis, 
hypertensive encephalopathy , and reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) (112, 113) .  Hypertension 
requiring treatment was not observed in children enrolled on the initial 
pediatric phase I trial of bevacizumab (85). 
 
Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during bevacizumab 
therapy.  Optimal co ntrol of blood pressure according to standard 
public health guidelines is recommended. Temporary interruption of 
bevacizumab therapy is rec ommended in patients with hypertension 
requiring medical therapy until adequate control is achieved.  
If hypertension cannot be controlled with medical therapy, 
bevacizumab therapy should be permanently discontinued.  
Bevacizumab should be permanently disc ontinued in patients who 
develop hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Proteinuria   
An increased incidence of proteinuria has been observed in patients 
treated with bevacizumab, with up to 38% of patients experiencing 
proteinuria.  The severity of proteinuria has ranged from asymptomatic 
and transient events detected on routine dipstick urinalysis to nephrotic 
syndrome; the majority of proteinuria events have been grade 1. NCI-
CTC grade 3 proteinuria was reported in up to 3% of bevaciz umab -
treated patients, and grade  4 in up to 1.4% of bevacizumab -treated 
patients. The proteinuria seen in bevacizumab clinical trials was not 
associated with renal impairment and rarely required permanent 
discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy. In adults w ith recurrent 
GBMs, the incidence of > grade 3 proteinuria was 1.3% in those who 
received bevacizumab and irinotecan, compared to 0% in patients who 
received bevacizumab alone (74). Patie nts with a history of 
Page 21 of 95 
hypertension may be at increased risk for the development of 
proteinuria when treated with bevacizumab.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Venous thromboembolism (VTE)  
  In clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of VTE 
events was 2.8% to  17.3% in the bevacizumab -containing arms 
compared with 3.2% to 15.6% in the chemotherapy control arms. The 
use of bevacizumab with chemotherapy does not substantially increase 
the risk of VTE event compared with chemotherapy alone.   
 
 In adults with recu rrent GBMs, the incidence of > grade 3 VTE was 
8.9% in those who received bevacizumab and irinotecan, compared to 
3.6% in patients who received bevacizumab alone (74). None of the 
childre n who received bevacizumab in the COG phase 1 trial (85) 
experienced any venous thrombotic complications.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE)  
An increased incidence of ATE events has been observed in pat ients 
treated with bevacizumab compared with those receiving control 
treatment.  ATE events include cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial 
infarction, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and other ATE events.  In 
a pooled analysis of data from five randomize d Phase II and III trials 
(mCRC [AVF2107g, AVF2192g, AVF0780g]; locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC [AVF0757g]; metastatic breast cancer 
[AVF2119g]), the incidence rate of ATE events was 3.8% (37 of 963) 
in patients who received chemotherapy   bevacizumab  compared with 
1.7% (13 of 782) in patients treated with chemotherapy alone.  ATE 
events led to a fatal outcome in 0.8% (8 of 963) of patients treated with 
chemotherapy   bevacizumab and 0.5% (4 of 782) of patients treated 
with chemotherapy alone. Cerebrov ascular accidents (including TIAs) 
occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with chemotherapy 
and bevacizumab and 0.5% of patients treated with chemotherapy 
alone.  Myocardial infarction occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with 
chemotherapy   bevacizumab comp ared with 0.7% of patients treated 
with chemotherapy alone.  
 
In adults with recurrent GBMs, the incidence of > grade 3 ATE was 
2.5% in those who received bevacizumab and irinotecan, compared to 
1.2% in patients who received bevacizumab alone (74). None of the 
children who received bevacizumab in the COG phase 1 trial (85) 
experienced any arterial thrombotic complications.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Gastrointestinal perforation  
Patients with metastatic carcinoma may be at increased risk for the 
development of gastrointestinal perforation and fistula when treated 
with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. A causal association of intra -
Page 22 of 95 
abdominal inflammatory processes and gastr ointestinal perforation to 
bevacizumab  treatment has not been established. Nevertheless, caution 
should be exercised when treating patients with intra -abdominal 
inflammatory processes with bevacizumab. Gastrointestinal perforation 
has been reported in oth er trials in non -colorectal cancer populations 
(e.g., ovarian, renal cell, pancreas, breast, and NSCLC) and may be 
higher in incidence in some tumor types.  
 
 In adults with recurrent GBMs, the incidence of > grade 3 
gastrointestinal perforation was 1.3% in  those who received 
bevacizumab and irinotecan, compared to 0% in patients who received 
bevacizumab alone (74).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Fistula  
Bevacizumab use has been associated with serious cases of fistulae 
including events resulting in death.  Fistulae in the GI tract are 
common (1% –10% incidence) in patients with metastatic CRC, but 
uncommon (0.1% 1%) or rare (0.01% –0.1%) in other indications.  In 
addition, fistulae that involve areas of the bod y other than the GI tract 
(e.g., tracheoesophageal, bronchopleural, urogenital, biliary) have been 
reported uncommonly (0.1% –1%) in patients receiving bevacizumab in 
clinical studies and postmarketing reports.  Events were reported at 
various time points d uring treatment, ranging from 1  week to  [ADDRESS_1192428] 6  months of therapy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Wound healing complications  
Wound healing complications such as wound dehiscence have been 
reported in patients receiving bevacizumab. In an analysis of pooled 
data from two trials in metastatic colorectal cancer, patients 
undergoing surgery 28 -60 days before study treatment with 5 -FU/LV 
plus bevacizumab did not appear to have an increased risk of wound 
healing complications compared to those treated with chemotherapy 
alone. Surgery in patients currently receiving bevacizumab is not 
recommended. No definitive data are available to define a safe interval 
after bevacizumab exposure with respect to wou nd healing risk in 
patients receiving elective surgery; however, the estimated half life of 
bevacizumab is 21 days.  
 
In adults with recurrent GBMs, the incidence of > grade 3 wound 
healing complication was 1.3% in those who received bevacizumab 
and irinot ecan, compared to 2.4% in patients who received 
bevacizumab alone (74).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Hemorrhage : Overall, grade 3 and 4 bleeding events were observed in 
4.0% of [ADDRESS_1192429] been observed in bevacizumab 
clinical studies were predominantly tumor -associated hemorrhage (see 
below) and minor mu cocutaneous hemorrhage.  
 
Tumor -Associated Hemorrhage : Major or massive pulmonary 
hemorrhage or hemoptysis has been observed primarily in patients with 
NSCLC.  Life -threatening and fatal hemoptysis was identified as a 
bevacizumab -related adverse event in N SCLC trials.  These events 
occurred suddenly and presented as major or massive hemoptysis.  
Among the possible risk factors evaluated (including squamous cell 
histology, treatment with anti -rheumatic/anti -inflammatory drugs, 
treatment with anticoagulants, prior radiotherapy, bevacizumab 
therapy, previous medical history of atherosclerosis, central tumor 
location, and cavitation of tumors during therapy), the only variables 
that showed statistically significant correlations with bleeding were 
bevacizumab the rapy and squamous cell histology. GI hemorrhages, 
including rectal bleeding and melena have been reported in patients 
with CRC, and have been assessed as tumor -associated hemorrhages. 
Tumor -associated hemorrhages were also seen rarely in other tumor 
types and locations, including a case of CNS bleeding in a patient with 
hepatoma with occult CNS metastases and a patient who developed 
continuous oozing of blood from a thigh sarcoma with necrosis.  
 
In adults with recurrent GBMs, the incidence of > grade 3 hemo rrhage 
was 2.5% in those who received bevacizumab and irinotecan, 
compared to 0% in patients who received bevacizumab alone (74). 
None of the children who received bevacizumab in the COG phase 1 
trial (85) experienced any tumor -associated hemorrhage.  
 
Mucocutaneous Hemorrhage : Across all bevacizumab clinical trials, 
mucocutaneous hemorrhage has been seen in 20% -40% of patients 
treated with bevacizum ab. These were most commonly NCI -CTC 
Grade [ADDRESS_1192430] also been less common events of minor 
mucocutaneous h emorrhage in other locations, such as gingival 
bleeding and vaginal bleeding.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RLPS)  
There have been rare reports of bevacizumab -treated patients 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_856454], a rare 
neurologic disorder that can present with the following signs and 
symptoms (among others):  seizures, headache, altered mental status, 
visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated 
hypertension . In adults with rec urrent GBMs, the incidence of RPLS 
Page 24 of 95 
was 1.3% in those who received bevacizumab and irinotecan, 
compared to 0% in patients who received bevacizumab alone (74). 
None of the children who rece ived bevacizumab in the COG phase 1 
trial (85) experienced RLPS.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Congestive heart failure (CHF) :  
 In clinical trials CHF was observed in all cancer indications studied to 
date, but predominantly in patien ts with metastatic breast cancer.  In 
the Phase III clinical trial of metastatic breast cancer (AVF2119g), 7 
(3%) bevacizumab -treated patients experienced CHF, compared with 
two (1%) control arm patients.  These  events varied in severity from 
asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to 
symptomatic CHF requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47276].  All the 
patients treated with bevacizumab were previously treated with 
anthracyclines (doxorubicin cumulative dose of 240 360 mg/m2).  
Many o f these patients also had prior radiotherapy to the left chest 
wall.  Most of these patients showed improved symptoms and/or left 
ventricular function following appropriate medical therapy  (114) . 
 
None of the adults  with recurrent GBMs treated with bevacizumab +/ - 
irinotecan experienced CHF (74). None of the children who received 
bevacizumab in the COG phase 1 trial (85) experienced CHF.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Neutropenia : Increased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia,   
or infection with severe neutropenia (including some fatalities) have 
been observed in patients treated with myelotoxic chemotherapy 
regimen s plus bevacizumab in comparison to chemotherapy alone 
(115) . In adults with recurrent GBMs, the incidence of > grade 3 
infection was 13.9% in those who received bevacizumab and 
irinotecan, compared to 9.5% in patie nts who received bevacizumab 
alone (74). Neutropenia was not a dose -limiting toxicity in those 
children who received bevacizumab in the COG phase 1 trial (85). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bone defects in growing children : The growth plates of actively 
growing bones consist of avascular cartilage that is replaced by [CONTACT_4210]. 
This is mediated by [CONTACT_856495] a VEGF gradient. S tudies in mice indicate that trabecular 
bone formation can be suppressed by [CONTACT_856496] (116) . Similarly, 
VEGF inhibitors caused metaphyseal dysplasia (hypertrophied 
chondrocytes and loss of metaphyseal capi[INVESTIGATOR_5778] y invasion) only in 
monkeys with open growth plates that was reversible on cessation of 
treatment (117) . Although large studies of the effects of bevacizumab 
on bone growth in humans are unavailable, a recent case report seems 
to suggest that bevacizumab was possibly causative in the occurrence 
of metaphys eal lytic lesions in a child with viscero -cutaneous 
Page 25 of 95 
angiomatosis (118) . There was complete healing of these lesions 
following cessation of bevacizumab (118) .

require an anti -convulsant.  Guidelines for VPA administration are provided in 
Section 5.2.  
 
 
5.1.2  Radiation Phase  
Radiation therapy should begin within 30 days of definitive surgery or 
radiographic diagnosis, whichever is the later date. Date of surgery or 
radiographic  diagnosis is considered day 1, and radiation should start no later 
than day 31. VPA will be continued daily without interruption during radiation 
therapy. VPA doses will be adjusted in increments of 5 mg/kg/day every 3 -5 
days to achieve and maintain troug h concentrations between 85 to 115 mcg/ml 
(See Section 5.2.2 and 5.2.3). During this time patients will receive standard 
radiation therapy as outlined in Section 9.0.  
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_1192441] Radiation Phase  
Patients will continue to receive VPA as during XRT.  If nece ssary, patients 
who had delays in XRT (e.g., secondary to schedule holidays or the need to have 
a new mask made) will complete their radiotherapy to the total prescribed 
protocol dose (See Section 9.0).  
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_1192442]. Patients with new hemorrhage on MRI will not be 
eligible for starting maintenance therapy, with the exception of asymptomatic 
punctate hemorrhage. Patients with improving or resolv ed pre -existing 
hemorrhage will be permitted to start maintenance treatment.  
 
Patients will continue VPA daily during maintenance therapy. All patients will 
start bevacizumab, 10 mg/kg iv every two weeks, at the start of maintenance 
therapy (See Section 5 .3). Maintenance therapy will continue uninterrupted if all 
laboratory tests as outlined in section 6.0 continue to meet on -study criteria as 
defined in Section 4.1.5. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease 
progression, patients will continue t o receive protocol treatment for a maximum 
total duration of two years (including the XRT phase).  
  
5.2 Valproic Acid (VPA) Administration and Monitoring Guidelines  
5.2.1  Drug Administration  
Valproic acid will be administered daily in three divided doses.  There will be 
no planned dosing interruptions.  Dose modifications for toxicity are outlined in 
Section 5.4.  
 
5.2.2  Starting Dose and Dose Escalations  
The starting dose of VPA will be 15 mg/kg/day, divided tid. Trough VPA 
concentration (measured 30 to 60 minutes before the next dose) will be 
measured every 3 to 5 days (if day 3 falls on a weekend) to reach a target trough 
VPA concentration of 100 mcg/mL (range, 85 -115 mcg/ml). The VPA dose will 
Page 31 of 95 
be adjusted in increments of 5 mg/kg/day to reach the desired trough 
concentration. Patients who initially reached the desired VPA concentration 
range but then required subsequent  dose escation (s) to maintain targeted trough 
concentration should also h ave trough VPA, CBC, and liver functions measured 
every [ADDRESS_1192443] recent weight.   
 
If available, a liquid/syrup preparation of valproic acid is preferred, and the dose 
should be rounded to the nearest [ADDRESS_1192444] 125 mg (unit dose for sprinkles 
or capsule). Use of extended release tablets of valproic acid is not permitted.   
 
Patients/families should attempt to adhere to a strict q 8 hour administration 
schedule (e.g. 7 am - 3 pm -11 pm schedule) as much as possible. Medication 
diaries (see Appendix IV) are required to document compliance. During 
radiation therapy, medication diaries should be checked and faxed weekly. After 
radiation therapy, medication diaries should be checked every 2 weeks and 
faxed every 4 weeks (see section 6.1, Table 5). Diaries should be faxed to 832-
825-1198 and a copy should be kept in the research chart.  
 
5.2.3  Measurement of Trough VPA Concentrations  
Because sampling true trough concentratio ns prior to the early morning dose 
may be logistically difficult, we recommend that VPA trough concentrations 
should be sampled 30 minutes to an hour prior to the afternoon dose.  
 
Once a patient has reached the targeted trough concentration 85 -115 mcg/ml, 
VPA trough concentrations will be measured weekly during radiation therapy, 
and then monthly or as clinically indicated thereafter.  
 
5.3 Bevacizumab Administration and Monitoring Guidelines  
5.3.1  Drug Administration  
All patients will receive bevacizumab (1 0 mg/kg iv) every two weeks for a 
maximal duration of therapy of 24 months (including XRT).  The initial infusion 
time will be over [ADDRESS_1192445] dose, the 
second dose will be given over 60 minutes, and if tolerate d, all subsequent doses 
will be given over 30 minutes.  Immediately after completion of the infusion, 
flush the IV infusion line with 30 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride to run at the 
same rate as the bevacizumab infusion.

experiences an infusion –associated adverse event, acetaminophen, steroids, 
diphenhydramine, or other medications may be given for symptom control and 
as premedicat ion for the next infusion; however, the infusion time may not be 
decreased for the subsequent infusion. If the next infusion is well tolerated with 
premedication, the subsequent infusion time may then be decreased by [ADDRESS_1192447] experiences an infusion -associated adv erse event with the 
30-minute infusion, all subsequent doses should be given over 60 minutes.  
 
5.4  Valproic Acid Dose Modifications  
Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html .  The following 
dose modifications are for adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely 
related to VPA.

two consecutive determinations at least 7 days apart  
c. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet < 25,000/mm3) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  If the toxicity resolves to meet study eligibility parameters within 14 
days o f discontinuation, the patient may resume treatment at a reduced 
dose as outlined in Section 5.4.5.  
 
5.4.5  Restarting VPA After Treatment Interruption  
a. VPA will be re -started at 5 mg/kg/day lower than the previous dose ( for 
example, if a patient’s VPA w as at 15 mg/kg/day divided tid at the time of 
the toxicity, then he/she should re -start at 10 mg/kg/day divided tid).  
b. VPA trough concentrations should then be monitored every 3 -5 days (if day 
3 falls on a weekend), and dose adjustments in 5 mg/kg will be made to 
maintain a trough concentration between 50 -85 mcg/ml in the event of a 
dose reduction.  
c. If a patient experiences another toxicity requiring that VPA be interrupted or 
held, despi[INVESTIGATOR_856458] 85 mcg/ml, 
then he/she will complete the remainder of radiation therapy without VPA.  
 
5.4.[ADDRESS_1192448]-XRT period and during maintenance therapy.  
b. For patients that expe rience a VPA -related toxicity during maintenance 
therapy, bevacizumab will be administered on schedule, provided that there 
is no other contraindication for bevacizumab (see section 5.5 and Table 3).  
c. Patients who experience VPA -related toxicities during ma intenance therapy 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_856459] 85 mcg/ml will complete 
maintenance therapy without re -starting VPA.  
d. If VPA is discontinued during XRT (except for any reason outlined in 
Section 5.4.1), VPA should be re -started with the fir st day of 
maintenance treatment .  The starting dose should be 10 mg/kg/day divided 
tid (or 5 mg/kg/day if patient experienced toxicities previously with 10 
mg/kg/day).  Dose escalations in increments of 5 mg/kg/day can then be 
made as outlined in Section 5 .2.2 and 5.2.3 to maintain trough VPA 
concentration of 50 -85 mcg/ml . Dose modification will be conducted as 
outlined in 5.4.1 through 5.4.5.  
e. For VPA interruption to accommodate an elective surgical procedure, see 
section 5.7.3b.  
 
5.5 Bevacizumab Dose Modi fications  
Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html .  The following 
dose modifications are  for adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely 
related to bevacizumab.  
 
5.5.1  There will be no dose reductions for toxicity related to bevacizumab. See Table 
3 for actions to be taken for bevacizumab related adverse events. If bevacizumab 
is held and a patient cannot resume treatment before the stipulated time for each 
toxicity, then this patient will discontinue bevacizumab.  
 
5.5.2  See Appendix V for other toxicities that may possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to bevacizumab. If a  toxicity can be clearly attributed to 
bevacizumab, VPA will be continued while bevacizumab is being held. In the 
event that a toxicity may be attributable to either VPA or bevacizumab and 
requires treatment modification, then BOTH VPA and bevacizumab trea tment 
will be modified accordingly.  
 
5.5.3  For bevacizumab interruption to accommodate an elective surgery, see section 
5.7.3a.

5.7.3 Surgery and wound healing:   
a. Bevacizumab -related concerns : 
If patients on treatment with bevacizumab require elective major surgery 
(see Table 4), i t is recommended that bevacizumab be held for 4 -8 weeks 
prior to the surgical procedure. Patients undergoing a major surgical 
procedure should not restart bevacizumab until 4 weeks after that 
procedure (in the case of high risk procedures such as liver res ection, 
thoracotomy, or neurosurgery, it is recommended that bevacizumab not to 
be restarted until 8 weeks after surgery). For elective intermediate surgical 
procedures (see definition below), bevacizumab should be discontinued at 
least [ADDRESS_1192452] 7 days prior to surgery.

Arteriovenous grafts   Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_856460] 38 of 95 
b. Valproic  acid-related concerns:  
Valproic acid can adversely affect platelet function and coagulation. For 
all elective surgical procedures, VPA should be withheld for a minimum of 
seven days, and pre -operative PT, PTT, platelet aggregation study, 
fibrinogen, and a von Willebrand panel should be performed. Prophylactic 
platelet transfusions should be considered for patients with a platelet count 
< 100,000/ mm3. Patients wi th any abnormal coagulation parameters 
should receive appropriate supportive care with blood or factor support. 
VPA should not be resumed until patient’s risk for post -operative bleeding 
is deemed minimal by [CONTACT_37039] , and VPA should be started at the s ame 
dose as patient was receiving prior to surgery. Patients undergoing 
emergent surgical procedures should be supported as clinically indicated.  
 
5.7.4  Proteinuria : Proteinuria will be monitored by [CONTACT_39701]:creatinine (UPC) 
ratio (see Appendix II) at  least every 4 weeks.  
 
5.7.5 Central venous catheters : Treatment via central venous catheters is 
recommended but not required. Placement of central venous catheters should 
be performed at least [ADDRESS_1192453] 48 hours before starting bevacizumab.   
 
5.7.6 Concomitant medications :  
a. Concomitant use of other anti -convulsants is strongly discouraged.  
b. The routine use of growth factors (GCSF, GM -CSF, and erythropoietin) is 
not permitted, except f or febrile neutropenia and/or sepsis.  
c. Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes, and 
general supportive care are to be used as deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_732466].  
d. Concomitant medications that may impact  platelet function (e.g., ibuprofen 
or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) or decrease platelet number should be avoided.   
e. See section 3.1.8 for VPA interactions with other medications.  
 
5.7.7 Elevated MCV : In the event of a persistent elevation of MCV > [ADDRESS_1192454] 2 weeks apart and 
persistent > grade [ADDRESS_1192455] 2 weeks, 
VPA should be withheld, and a bone marrow examination should be 
performed to rule out bone marrow aplasia or myelodyspla stic syndrome.  
 
5.7.8 Hepatitis/pancreatitis : In the event of unexplained abdominal pain, jaundice, 
vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, or other symptoms possibly attributable to 
hepatitis and/or pancreatitis, amylase/lipase, ALT, bilirubin, fibrinogen, and an 
abdo minal ultrasound should be performed immediately, and VPA should be 
withheld pending the results of these tests.  
 
Patients who experience radiographic documentation of pancreatitis OR > 
grade 2 elevation in amylase/lipase accompanied by [CONTACT_223683], ja undice,

vomiting, anorexia, or other symptoms possibly attributable to pancreatitis, in 
the absence of other apparent etiologies, such as, but not limited to, trauma or 
gall stones, will discontinue VPA for the remainder of protocol therapy.  
 
5.7.9 Hyperammonemi a, encephalopathy, and carnitine supplementation : 
Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with VPA despi[INVESTIGATOR_856453]. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, 
and/or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephal opathy should be 
considered, and an ammonia level should be checked immediately. In patients 
with > grade 3 encephalopathy, with or without hyperammonemia, VPA 
should be discontinued for the remainder of protocol therapy, and evaluations 
for urea cycle dis orders should be considered, if clinically indicated. In 
patients with hyperammonemia encephalopathy, intravenous L -carnitine 
should be considered with other supportive measures (109, 110) . 
 
Individual investigators  may elect to supplement L -carnitine, at 50 -100 
mg/kg/day, divided bid or tid, not to exceed 3 gram/day. Carnitine 
supplementation has been shown to ameliorate the CNS symptoms in those 
children with carnitine depletion as a result of VPA administration.

The GTV -[ADDRESS_1192471] defines the extent of residual 
disease should be used to determine the GTV -2. If only a small biopsy has been 
performed, the GTV -2 may be iden tical to the GTV -1. If the tumor has been 
completely resected, there will not be a GTV -2 and the radiation therapy course 
will end with completion of the initial radiation fields.

total dose to the PTV -1 prescription point will be 45 Gy given in 25 
fractions of 1.8 Gy each. The patient will be treat ed with one fraction per 
day. All fields will be treated each day. The total dose to the prescription 
point will be 54 Gy given in 30 fractions. The patient will be treated 
with one fraction per day with all fields treated per day. 1.80 Gy will be 
delivere d to the isocenter.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Planning Target Volume 2 (PTV -2) 
This boost is delivered only to those patients with gross residual disease  
other than brainstem tumors.  For brain tumors with gross residual 
disease, the total boost dose to the PTV -[ADDRESS_1192475] will prescribe between 3 and 5 
fractions based on his/her practice. The cumulative dose to the 
prescription point will be between 50.[ADDRESS_1192476] planning techniques, the dose variation in the PTV shall be within 
+7% and -5% of the prescribed dose. For conformal planning techniques (3D 
conformal and IMRT), the enti re PTV shall be encompassed within the 95% 
isodose surface and no more than 10% of the PTV should receive more than 
110% of the prescription dose, as evaluated by [CONTACT_207461].  
 
9.3.6  Treatment Interruptions  
No treatment breaks in the radiation t herapy component of this combined 
modality treatment are anticipated. Skin reactions should be treated supportively. 
Low blood counts are generally related to systemic therapy and are not caused or 
worsened by [CONTACT_856503].  
 
9.4 Treatment Technique  
 
9.4.1  Treatment Planning  
Two-dimensional or conformal (three dimensional) planning may be used in this 
study.  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_1192477] more than 5 mm outside the PTV  should not exceed 46 Gy.  
 
10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATION  
 
10.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
There will be two major subgroups of patients:  
a. Patients with high -grade gliomas (GBM, anaplastic astrocytoma)  
b. Patients with other gliomas (gliosarcoma, gliomato sis cerebri, or diffuse intrinsic 
brainstem gliomas)  
 
 Page 49 of 95  
 
EFS and OS will be analyzed separately for each group.  
 
For high -grade gliomas, 30 patients will be enrolled over 3 years, with a minimum 
follow -up of 24 months. Using a one -year EFS of 36% for children  with GBM in 
ACNS0126, this sample size will achieve 90% power (using a one -sided  = 0.05) in 
detecting a 20% improvement in one -year EFS (from 36% to 56%) in comparison. If only 
21 patients are enrolled, the proposed study will achieve 80% power in detecting a 20% 
improvement in one -year EFS.  
 
For other gliomas, the 1 -year EFS of 17%  for children with newly diagnosed brainstem 
gliomas from CCG -9941 (10) will be used for comparison. If 26 patients from this group 
are enrolled, this study will achieve 90% power (using a one -sided  = 0.05) in det ecting 
a 20% improvement in one -year EFS (from 17% to 37%). If only 19 patients are enrolled, 
the proposed study will achieve 80% power in detecting a 20% improvement in one -year 
EFS. These calculations were performed for one -arm survival studies under the  
assumption of exponentially distributed endpoints.  
 
Based on the number of children newly diagnosed with high -grade gliomas in [LOCATION_007] in 
2006, we anticipate an accrual of 1 -2 patients with high -grade gliomas per month.  
 
10.2 Study Design and Data Analysis  
Toxicities will be described separately for the radiation phase (VPA and radiation) and 
the maintenance phase (VPA and bevacizumab) treatment.  
 
For the radiation phase of treatment, if more than one -third of patients enrolled (i.e. 
greater than two of the  first three, three of the first six, four of the first nine patients, etc.) 
required discontinuation of VPA, as outlined in section 5.4.1 and 5.4.2, then all 
subsequent patients will receive radiation therapy without valproic acid. Patients who 
required d iscontinuation of VPA during XRT and subsequent patients who received XRT 
without VPA because this combination is considered not tolerable (as described 
previously) will still receive VPA and bevacizumab during maintenance, provided that 
there is no contra indication to VPA as described in 5.4.1.  
 
For the maintenance phase of treatment, if more than one -third of patients enrolled 
experienced  toxicities that require DISCONTINUATION OF  BOTH VPA and 
bevacizumab (as defined in section 5.4 and 5.5), subsequent p atients will not receive this 
combination of treatment.  Dose modifications due to toxicities that may be attributed to 
a single drug are addressed in sections 5.4 -5.6. 
 
The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the one -year and two -year EFS and 
OS for each group with 95% confidence intervals. The one -sample logrank test (120) will 
be used to test for significant improvement in survival compared to the above -referenced 
historical trials for each group. Similar analyses will be performed for subgroups of 
children with completed resected and subtotally resected tumors.  
 
Althou gh tumor response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, for patients with 
residual tumors after initial surgery or at the start of maintenance therapy, tumor response 
rate to radiation and VPA or to VPA and bevacizumab will be summarized by [CONTACT_158715] g 
 
 Page [ADDRESS_1192478] 95% binomial confidence intervals.  Response will be 
documented by [CONTACT_856504] 6.[ADDRESS_1192479] tumor response to treatment.

 Interval of time between study entry and documentation of disease progression 
(clinical or radiographic), second ary malignancy, death from other causes, or date 
of last follow -up.

12.0 EVALUATION, RECORDING , REPORTING, AND MON ITORING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS  
Safety assessments will be made using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events v3.0 (CTCAE) http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . Adverse event data collection 
and reporting are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in this study as well as those who 
will enroll in future trials using similar agents.  
 
12.1 DEFINITIONS  
 
12.1.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse Events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with either valproic 
acid or bevacizumab. An AE for this study can therefore be any u nfavorable or 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of either valproic acid and/or bevacizumab, 
whether or not attributable to these agents used in this investigational study.  
 
 Page 52 of 95  
 
AEs that are not described in the protocol, in published medical literature, in the 
patient’s informed consent, or in Investigator Brochure are defined as unexpected 
AEs.  
 
A pre -existing condition should not be reported as an AE unless the condition 
worsens or epi[INVESTIGATOR_856467].  
 
 
 
12.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
that: 
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Requires in -patient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability and/or incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is any important medical event, based on appropriate medical judgment, that 
jeopardizes the p atient and requires medical and/or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856468]/planned surgeries or administration of protocol 
therapy should not be reported as SAE2 unless an unpredicted complication  
results in a prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
“Death” and “Disease Progression (PD)” should not be reported as SAEs. Death 
should be reported as an outcome of an SAE (i.e. the specific cause of death 
should be reported as the SAE).  
 
12.2 ADVERSE EVENT DESCRI PTION  
 
The AE collection/reporting period will begin with the first day of valproic acid 
treatment. AEs after study registration but prior to the first day of valproic acid will be 
captured as ongoing concurrent secondary diagnoses and symptoms present at the start of 
study. AEs will be graded in accordance with the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . If not described 
in the NCI -CTCAE, AEs will be graded according to their severity using the following 
criteria: grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), grade 3 (severe), and grade 4 (life -
threatening).  
 
The investigator will assign attribution of an AE to valproic acid, bevacizumab, or 
BOTH, as one of the following categories:  
 
 Unrelated  
 Unlikely  
 Possible  
 
 Page 53 of 95  
 Probable  
 Definite  
 
12.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS   
 
All adverse events, regardless of perceived relationship to study treatment, will be 
reported and recorded on the appropriate CRFs. N ew AEs and AEs that are ongoing at 
the off-treatment visit  will be followed for 30 days from the patient’s receipt of the last 
dose of protocol therapy, unless they have resolved earlier. SAEs and drug -related AEs 
ongoing at the end of study will be follow ed until resolution.  
 
The AE description will include the nature of the experience, the date of onset, the 
resolution date, the severity of each sign or symptom reported using the NCI -CTCAE 
(version 3.0), the seriousness of the event, the potential relatio nship to study treatment, 
the course of action taken, and the outcome of the experience.  
 
Any serious or immediately life -threatening adverse experience, including those resulting 
in death, occurring while the patient is receiving either valproic acid or b evacizumab, or 
within 30 days of the patient’s last dose of protocol therapy, regardless of the treating 
physician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_85155], will be reported by [CONTACT_18623]/or e -
mail ( within 24 hours of the event ) to the Study Chair. A writt en report must be 
submitted via fax or e -mail within two working days  to the study Chair. Individual 
institutions are responsible for reporting serious adverse events to their institutional 
review board (IRB) according to each board’s required time frame.

APPENDIX II  
Procedure for Obtaining a Urine Protein / Creatinine Ratio  
 
1)  Obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample (does not have to be a 24 hour urine)  
2)  Determine protein concentration (mg/dL)  
3)  Determine creatinine concentration (mg/dL)  
4)  Urine protein / crea tinine ratio =  protein concentration (mg /dL) divide by [CONTACT_856516] (mg /dL)  
 
The UPC directly correlates with the amount of protein excreted in the urine per 24 hrs (i.e. a UPC 
of 1 should be equivalent to 1g protein in a 24hr urine collectio n) 
                                            
Protein and creatinine concentrations should be available on standard reports of urinalyses, not 
dipsticks. If protein and creatinine concentrations are not routinely reported at an Institution, their 
measurem ents and reports may need to be requested.

APPENDIX VIII: SAMPLE INFORMED CONSENT / PARENTAL PERMISSION FOR 
PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH  
 
A Phase 2 Study of Valproic Acid and Radiation, Followed by [CONTACT_856517] e Valproic Acid and 
Bevacizumab in Children with Newly Diagnosed High -Grade Gliomas or Brainstem Gliomas  
 
The use of “you” in this document refers to you or your child; the use of “we” in this document 
refers to the doctors and other study staff.  
 
This stu dy is a clinical trial, or a research study involving patients and a potential new treatment. 
Clinical trials include only patients who choose to take part. Your participation in this study is entirely 
voluntary. Please read the consent form carefully, and  you will be given a copy of this consent if you 
decide to participate. You may discuss your decision with your friends and family if you would like.  
 
You are being asked to participate in this study because you have an aggressive brain tumor called 
gliob lastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, gliomatosis cerebri, gliosarcoma, or brainstem 
glioma. These brain tumors are collectively called “malignant gliomas.” This study is being conducted 
by [CONTACT_856518] -Oklahoma Pediatric Neuro -Oncology Consortium, whic h consists of nine pediatric 
cancer centers treating children with brain tumors in the state of [LOCATION_007] and Oklahoma.  
 
Currently, there are few effective treatments for your type of aggressive brain tumors. Surgery and 
radiation can generally slow down thes e aggressive brain tumors, but in the majority of patients, these 
tumors will start growing again in 6 -12 months. Adding chemotherapy drugs to surgery and radiation 
does not clearly improve the cure rate of children with malignant gliomas. We are conductin g this 
study to see if the combination of valproic acid and bevacizumab (also known as AvastinTM) with 
surgery and radiation will shrink your brain tumor more effectively and improve your chance of cure.  
 
Valproic acid (VPA) has been given to children with  seizures (epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) for many decades, and it has 
been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) but has not been approved specifically for 
treating children with brain tumors. From [ADDRESS_1192526] clinical experience in 
giving VPA with bevacizum ab, the second drug that you will receive on this clinical trial. Therefore, 
the use of VPA with radiation and bevacizumab for your brain tumor is considered investigational.  
 
Tumors in general require extra blood vessels to support their rapid growth and high nutritional 
demands. A type of protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, has been shown to be 
produced at high levels in many human tumors, including malignant gliomas. Bevacizumab 
(AvastinTM) is a specific antibody (a protein that r ecognizes and binds to another protein) for the 
VEGF protein, and in animal studies, treatment with bevacizumab has been shown to decrease VEGF 
levels, cut off blood vessels, and shrink many human tumors, including malignant gliomas. More than 
eight thousa nd adults have received bevacizumab, either as a single drug or in combination with 
chemotherapy drugs, in numerous clinical trials, and this drug has been approved by [CONTACT_856519] 83 of 95  
treatment of colon and lung cancers. Recently, clinical trials in adults wit h recurrent malignant gliomas 
(tumors that started growing after initial surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy) showed that 
bevacizumab can shrink these tumors in more than 25% of patients. Bevacizumab has been tested in 
children with recurrent solid tumors , and there is a current clinical trial testing bevacizumab and 
chemotherapy in children with recurrent brain tumors. Bevacizumab was recently approved by [CONTACT_168136] a treatment for patients with malignant gliomas; however, the combination of VPA and 
bevac izumab is considered investigational.  
 
VPA is a commercially available drug. The bevacizumab that will be used in this clinical trial is for 
use in research studies only. Although there may be some minor differences between the bevacizumab 
used for researc h studies only and the commercial drug AvastinTM, both drugs are manufactured by a 
similar process and supplied by [CONTACT_81363] (Genentech, Inc), meet similar standards for final 
product testing, and are expected to be similar in safety and effectivene ss. 
 
Why is this study being done?  
We are testing the combination of VPA, a commonly drug for epi[INVESTIGATOR_58826], with a new 
drug, bevacizumab, for children who have just been diagnosed with malignant gliomas. This new 
combination of treatment will be gi ven in addition to surgery and radiation, which are 
considered to be the standard treatment for children with malignant gliomas.  
 
The goals of this study are:  
 To see if children with malignant gliomas treated with VPA and bevacizumab, in 
addition to surger y and radiation, will have a higher cure rate compared to children 
that received surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy in the past;  
 To learn what kinds of side effects will occur in children with malignant gliomas 
when they receive VPA and bevacizumab, in a ddition to surgery and radiation;  
 To learn if levels of proteins that are affected by [CONTACT_856520], in your brain tumor will 
predict your tumor’s response to VPA and/or radiation;  
 To learn if levels of proteins that allow tumor cells to repair damage to genes in br ain 
tumors will predict tumor response to VPA and/or radiation  
 To learn if levels of certain proteins that are affected by [CONTACT_856521] a tumor to bevacizumab and/or radiation  
 
How many people will take part in the study?  
There will be about [ADDRESS_1192527] 2 years.  About ___ will be 
treated at this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If the analysis at 2 years showed that this new combination is beneficial for 
children with malignant gliomas, we will continue to  recruit more patients; if not, this clinical trial will 
be closed, but if you have already started this clinical trial at the time of its closure, you can still 
continue to receive this combination of treatment.  
 
What will happen if I take part in this re search study?   
Before you begin the study …   
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the study.  
These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not 
join t he study.   If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated.  This will be 
up to your study doctor.

 A medical history  
 Physical exam, including a neurological exam  
 Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, weight, heigh t, and body surface area)  
 Blood tests  
 Urine tests  
 Pregnancy test (if you are a woman who could have children)  
 MRI of brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
 A lumbar puncture (a spi[INVESTIGATOR_122499]), if your doctor thinks it is safe and required for your care  
 Any other studies or tests y our treating doctor thinks it is necessary to give you the best care  
 
If you are not done growing, you will also have to have an X -ray of your knee to monitor for any side 
effects that may be related to bevacizumab.  
 
Surgery  
If your neurosurgeon and your t reating doctor think that surgery can be safely performed, you will first 
have a surgery (or more than one if needed) to remove as much of your brain tumor as possible. For 
some of you, surgery may not be safe and will not be performed. Please discuss the safety of surgery 
for your brain tumor with your neurosurgeon and treating doctor.  
 
Radiation  
Once you have recovered from your surgery, you will start VPA and radiation as described in the table 
below. You will meet with a radiation oncologist (doctors wh o will be giving you radiation to treat 
your brain tumor) to discuss the side effects of radiation therapy. VPA will be given to you by [CONTACT_1966], 
either as capsules, syrup, or a combination of both. You will take VPA three times a day (every 8 
hours), and we will ask you to keep a diary of the date and time when you take your VPA.  
 
Treatment and Tests Required During Your Radiation Treatment  
 Monday through 
Friday  Daily  Once a week  
Radiation  For about 6 weeks    
VPA   3 times a day, by [CONTACT_856522], blood tes ts   Once a week; more if needed  
VPA drug diary   Record with each dose   
 
Your radiation will last about [ADDRESS_1192528] period of about 4 weeks before you start 
your maintenance treatment (combination of bevacizumab and VPA; see discussion below). Assuming 
that you have no side effect from VPA th at require you to discontinue this drug, you will continue 
VPA three times daily without interruption during this rest period. If you have had side effects related 
to VPA and was instructed to discontinue this drug during radiation, then you will not re -start this drug 
until the start of your maintenance treatment (see below). Your will have an MRI at about [ADDRESS_1192529] of the blood tests that 
you already had at the beginning, to make sure that you can still tolerate your treatment. Bevacizumab 
will be given to you through your vein (i.v.) in the clinic every two weeks, and VPA will be given to 
you by [CONTACT_360537] a day, as you have been taking this drug during radiation. Even if you have 
experienced side effects with VPA during radiation and needed to stop this drug, we wil l still ask you 
to re-start VPA, but at a lower dose to prevent the same side effect(s) from happening again.  
 
You will continue to receive bevacizumab and VPA, assuming that you do not experience any side 
effects that require you to stop either or both d rugs, for a maximum period of 94 weeks. Therefore, the 
maximum length of your total treatment (radiation, VPA, and bevacizumab) will be two years (104 
weeks). During your maintenance treatment, you will have blood tests, urine tests, and MRIs done as 
descr ibed in the table below. These tests are to ensure that you are not having unsafe side effects from 
your treatment. If you experience side effects and have to stop either bevacizumab or VPA, you have 
the option of remaining on this clinical trial and conti nuing the other drug by [CONTACT_5071]. However, you may 
also elect to stop participating in this clinical trial and seek other treatment options.  
 
Treatment and Tests Required During Maintenance Therapy  
 Daily  Every [ADDRESS_1192530] each 
dose     
Bevacizumab   i.v. every 2 weeks     
Blood pressure   Every 2 weeks     
Exam and blood 
tests    Every 4 weeks    
Urine tests    Every 4 weeks    
MRI of brain     Every 12 
weeks   
MRI of spi[INVESTIGATOR_856477])      If needed  
X-ray of knee      Every [ADDRESS_1192531] to be inserted and replaced every 2 weeks, or through a permanently placed 
catheter called a central line (w hich will require a surgery). Please discuss with you treating doctor 
regarding the safety of placing and maintaining a central line.  
 
Biological studies  
We would like to study the levels of some proteins in your blood and brain tumor because we think 
that they may predict how your tumor will respond to radiation, VPA, and/or bevacizumab. In 
addition, by [CONTACT_856523], we hope to learn more about 
malignant gliomas in children and design more effective treatment in the  near future. Participation in 
these biologic studies is entirely voluntary; your refusal to participate will not prevent you from 
receiving the treatment already described in this consent. If you weight more than [ADDRESS_1192532] both studied.  
 
Please indicate by [CONTACT_856524].  
 
______/______ Yes, I agree to participate in the biological studie s. 
 
 If you answered “Yes,” please choose only one of the following options:  
 
  ______  I only agree to have my tumor used for the biological studies.  
 
  ______ I only agree to have my blood used for the biological studies.  
 
  ______ I agree to have both m y blood and tumor used for the biological studies.  
 
______/______ No, I do not agree to participate in the biological studies.  
 
How long will I be in the study?  
You may be in the study for up to 24 months if you are responding to therapy and not having sid e 
effects that are dangerous for you.  Your doctor may decide to take you off study if any of the 
following occur:  
 The side effects of VPA and/or bevacizumab are too harmful for you  
 You need a treatment that is not allowed on this study  
 Your tumor has grow n back or become larger despi[INVESTIGATOR_856478]  
 You are not able to follow study -related treatment instructions  
 New information becomes available  
 The study is not in your best interest  
 The study is stopped because there is no benefit for your  type of brain tumor  
 
After you are taken off treatment or after you have completed your treatment, your treating doctor will 
ask you to return for follow up exams and tests to ensure that you are not having dangerous side 
effects. Please continue to follo w these instructions to ensure your safety.  
 
 
 Page 87 of 95  
Can I stop being in the study?  
Yes.  You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_98358].  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.  
 
It is importa nt to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_856479]/or 
bevacizumab can be evaluated by [CONTACT_4904].  Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking 
about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60769] -up care and testing could be most helpful for you.  
 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your 
best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped.  
 
What side effects or risks can I exp ect from being in the study?  
 
Side Effects of Valproic Acid  
The side effects that we think valproic acid might have are listed below. There might be other 
side effects that we do not know about yet because we have only limited experience in using this 
drug to treat brain tumors in children. These side effects could be dangerous or life threatening. 
We will be checking you closely to see if any side effects are happening. Side effects of drugs like 
valproic acid usually get better if the treatment is stoppe d, but in some cases they can be serious 
and/or irreversible.  There is the risk of death.  If you do have side effects, we may recommend 
medicine or treatments to try to control them and make you comfortable.  You should talk to 
your study doctor as soon as possible about any side effects that you have while taking part in the 
study.

together, you should notify your treating doctor immediately if another doctor starts you on one of 
these medications, because you will have to be closely monitored for valpro ic acid levels and the side 
effects of these medications.  
 
Side Effects of Bevacizumab  
The side effects that we think bevacizumab might have are listed below. There might be other 
side effects that we do not know about yet because we have only limited exp erience in using 
bevacizumab to treat brain tumors in children. These side effects could be dangerous or life 
threatening. We will be checking you closely to see if any side effects are happening. Side effects 
of drugs like bevacizumab usually get better i f the treatment is stopped, but in some cases they 
can be serious and/or irreversible.  There is the risk of death.  If you do have side effects, we may 
recommend medicine or treatments to try to control them and make you comfortable.  You 
should talk to y our study doctor as soon as possible about any side effects that you have while 
taking part in the study.   
 
Likely side effects:  
 Nose bleeds  
 High blood pressure – in most patients, blood pressure can be controlled with routine 
medications. Rarely, uncontr olled high blood pressure may lead to damage to the brain and 
other vital organ functions.  
 Fatigue  
 Skin reactions (itching, rash, flaking of the skin, or hives)  
 Headache  
 Soreness in mouth or throat  
 Stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, abnormal reac tions in the nose or sinuses  
 Nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite  
 Diarrhea  
 Heartburn  
 Abnormal blood chemistry or electrolytes  
 Generalized pain or pain at the tumor site  
 Voice changes, hoarseness, laryngitis  
 Cough and/or shortness of breath  
 Dizziness  
 
Less likely side effects  
 Mild to moderate bleeding in the tumor, stomach, intestine, genitourinary tract, or other 
parts of the body  
 
 Page 90 of 95  
 Blood clots in the veins of the leg, lungs, or other parts of the body. These clots can be life -
threatening.  
 Clots in the arteri es, including stroke or heart attack. These conditions can be life -
threatening or fatal.  
 Leakage of protein in the urine, which can rarely lead to damage to the kidney or kidney 
failure.  
 Reaction to bevacizumab – these reactions may include skin reactions  (itching, rash, swelling, 
flaking of skin, and hives), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (shortness of breath, cough, throat 
tightness, wheezing), cardiac symptoms (low blood pressure, dizziness), or others (chill, 
shivering)  
 Constipation  
 Decrease in white cell count (neutropenia) which may increase your risk of an infection  
 Decrease in red cell count, which may require a blood transfusion  
 
Rare but serious side effects  
 Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) or similar leukoencephalopathy 
syndrome: RP LS is a medical condition related to leakiness of blood vessels in the brain and 
can cause confusion, blindness or vision changes, seizure, and other symptoms, as well as 
changes on your MRI. This condition is usually reversible, but in rare cases, it is p otentially 
life-threatening and may have long -term side effects on brain functions.  
 Serious or fatal bleeding into the tumor, brain, gut, lungs, or other parts of the body  
 Bowel perforation and bowel anastomotic dehiscence. Bowel perforation occurs when an  
opening exists in the bowel wall allowing bowel contents to spi[INVESTIGATOR_736563]. Bowel 
anastomotic dehiscence is a breakdown in the surgical connection between two pi[INVESTIGATOR_856480]. These events are rare in patients who have not had prior bowel surgerie s, but they can 
lead to serious infections and will require surgery to repair the breaks.  
 Fistula formation: defect in the walls of luminal organs such as the upper airway, lungs, 
esophagus, rectum, or vagina. Fistula formation may lead to life -threatening  complications, 
including serious infections, bleeding, or dysfunctions of organs.  
 Heart problems (including irregular heartbeats, fluid collections around the heart, heart 
attack, or heart failure).  
 Stroke  
 Fluid collection within tissues of the lungs  
 Dela yed or poor wound healing  
 Severe allergic reactions that result in difficulty breathing, a severe drop in blood pressure, 
and possible death  
 Reversible changes in the liver functions  
 Serious and sometimes fatal infection when your white cell count is very low (severe 
neutropenia)  
 Sudden death of uncertain relationship to bevacizumab  
 
Growth and Development Risks Associated with Bevacizumab

Possible Side Effects of Radiation Therapy to the Brain  
Short -term side effects  
 Hair loss, both temporary and permanent  
 Irritation or redness of the skin with possible peeling of the skin at the sites of radiation  
 Areas of the ear canal exposed to radiation  may develop inflammation and irritation weeks to 
months after treatment, causing plugging of ears and poor balance  
 Nausea, vomiting, and poor appetite  
 Weight loss from poor appetite  
 Fatigue  
 Short -term memory problems (difficulty remembering things, diffic ulty concentrating)  
 Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_856481] -term side effects  
 Memory difficulties (difficulty remembering things, recalling things, performing complicated 
tasks, etc.)  
 Learning difficulties (problems with learning new tasks or skills, problems with academ ic 
performance in school, etc.)  
 Hearing loss  
 Changes in hormone function and levels, sometimes requiring hormone replacement  
 Growth failure, sometime requiring growth hormone  
 Vision problems  
 
You should discuss the potential side effects of radiation thera py in details with your radiation 
oncologist.  
 
Possible Side Effects of Surgery to Remove Your Brain Tumor  
Surgery to remove part or all of your brain tumor will only be performed if your neurosurgeon and 
your treating physician believe that such a surgery  can be safely performed and its benefit outweighs 
its potential risk. Please discuss the benefit and risk of the surgery for your brain tumor with your 
neurosurgeon and treating physician.

1.0 Study Summary  
Title: Evaluating the Impact of the Bridge Clinic in Patients with Opi[INVESTIGATOR_338666]:  
• A im 1: To determine  whether  referral to the Bridge Clinic reduces overall i ndex 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338667] a long-term 
outpatient addiction provider  for patients with active opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) 
being considered for medications -for-addiction treatment (MAT ). 
• Aim 2: T o evaluate the effects of the same intervention in the same population 
on secondary outcomes  including costs, care -linkage, readmission rates, self-
reported buprenorphine  or naltrexone  fills, r ate of known recurrent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], 
and measures of overall quality of life.  
• Aim 3: E valuate fidelity outcomes  includ ing Bridge Clinic acceptance and 
attendance rates  among those referred to Bridge Clinic  and reasons why patients 
were not considered to be eligible for inclusion . 
• Aim 4:  A mong the subgroup of patients with an infection for which a course of IV 
antibiotics is required, additionally evaluate whether access to the Bridge Clinic 
facilitates outpatient management of the antibiotic therapy, with consequent improvement in clinical (infection and mortality) and resource (inpatient days , 
time to discharge following a negative blood culture) outcomes . 
 S
tudy Hypotheses:  
• Primary: Among patients with active OUD being considered for MAT, index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338668] r eferral to 
the Bridge Clinic than among patients randomized to no referral to the Bridge 
Clinic. 
• Secondary:  Among patients  with active OUD being considered for MAT , total 
costs, readmission rates, and rate of recurrent opi[INVESTIGATOR_338669] -linkage, self-reported  buprenorphine  or naltrexone  prescription 
fill rates and quality of life will be higher among patients randomized to referral 
to the Bridge Clinic than among patients randomized to no referral to the Bridge 
Clinic. 
• Exploratory: Among patients with active O UD being considered for MAT who also 
have an infection  requiring IV antibiotics , referral to the Bridge Clinic will result in 
lower resource use without worse clinical outcomes when compared with not being referred to the Bridge clinic.  
 
Study Population:   Inpatients with OUD being considered for  medications -for-
addiction treatment  (MAT) who have not  previously utilized Bridge Clinic . 
 Due to COVID and the resulting changes in patient flow, we will temporarily suspend 
eligibility for the trial for OPAT pat ients as of December 3
rd, 2020.

 Comparators : 
• Direct referral to a long -term outpatient addiction provider  
• Referral to the Bridge Clinic while long -term ou tpatient addiction provider is 
located/identified  
 
Randomization:  Randomization will occur at the i ndividual patient level.  Currently, the 
Bridge Clinic can only accept a limited number of patients. To learn from the care 
provided , we propose randomizing all patients  eligible for referral to Bridge Clinic in a 
ratio such that the Bridge Clinic is at capacity. In this way, the choice to refer is 
unbiased and the strength of evidence is greatly enhanced.  
 
Consent: This study involves comparing two approaches  to care: i) inpatient  MAT 
(buprenorphine  or naltrexone)  with search for an outpatient MAT provider to accept the 
patient, or ii) inpatient MAT ( buprenorphine  or naltrexone) with referral to the Bridge 
Clinic to maintain the patient’s care until a long-term outpatient MAT provider accepts 
the patient. Both approaches represent  standard  of care.  
 
It is not practicable to answer the research question with informed consent because 
patients who choose to participate will necessarily differ from those who do no t in 
substantial ways, including access to care .  
 We request a waiver of consent as 1) all data for  the research will be obtained from the 
medical record, financial systems,  state-mandated reporting systems, and from routine 
standard of care telephonic ou treach to patients, 2) we are comparing usual c are 
practices , albeit with randomization, 3) there is  no additional interaction with the 
participant for research purposes, and  4) it is impracticable to conduct the research with 
consent . 
  
2.0 Background  
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_338670] i n 2017, where rates of overdose 
already exceed the na tional average, and these trends were reflected in VUH admissions 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) -related problems, which were up 55% in the first 6 
months of 2018 over 2017.
1 Vanderbilt is implementing se veral initiatives to improve 
outcomes in patients with OUD.  On July 20th, 2018, a new Addiction Consult Team 
(ACT) went live at Vanderbilt.  The service has completed 1,082  patient visits as of May 
29th 2019 (373 new visits and 709 follow up visits) .  Add itionally, we have created  an 
outpatient “Bridge Clin ic” at VUMC that is available to  manage patients with OUD for a 
transitional period of up to [ADDRESS_418691] clinicians staff 
both the consult service and the Bridge Clinic , providing continuity of care to patients 
leaving VUH.  Staff include internal medicine, psychiatry, pain -anesthesia, nursing, social 
work and a recovery coach. A patient discharged  from VUH who is deemed approp riate

 for the Bridge Clinic is written a bridge  script for buprenorphine MAT.  Upon discharge 
and between Bridge Clinic visits, the use of VUMC preferred communications (telephone , 
text, email)  outreach by [CONTACT_338677] ; telephone  outreach  may 
improve outcomes similarly to face -to-face contact [CONTACT_338678].[ADDRESS_418692]  
is not achieved and alternative approaches are needed to improve the system of care for 
OUD patients being considered for MAT. Given the overarching goal of evaluatin g the 
Bridge Clinic as it is operating, the spe cific aims of this study are to:   
 
• A
im 1: To determin e whether  referral to the Bridge Clinic reduces o verall index  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338667] a long-term 
outpatient addiction p rovider  for patients with active opi[INVESTIGATOR_338671] (OUD) 
being considered for medicatio ns-for-addiction treatment (MAT ). 
• Aim 2: T o evaluate the effects of the same intervention in the same population 
on secondary outcomes  including costs, care -linkage, r eadmission rates, self-
reported buprenorphine or naltrexone fills, r ate of known recurren t opi[INVESTIGATOR_338672] e, 
and measures of overall quality of life.

 • Aim 3: Evaluate fidelity outcomes  including Bridge Clinic acceptance and 
attendance rates among those referred to Bridge Clinic and reasons why patients 
were n ot considered to eligible for inclusion.  
• Aim 4 :  Among  the subgroup of patients with an infection for which a course of IV 
antibiotics is required, additionally evaluate whether access to the Bridge Clinic 
facilitates outpatient management of the antibiotic  therapy, with consequent 
improvement in c linical (in fection and mortality) and resource (inpatient days, 
time to discharge following a negative blood culture) outcomes.  
 
T
o complete these aims, patients admit ted to VUH with OUD and being considered for 
MAT, who have not previously utilized Bridge Clinic,  will be enrolled in a pragmatic, 
single- center, randomized, controlled trial comparing  referral to Bridge Clinic versus no 
referral to usual care in the commu nity. Randomization ratio will be set to ensure the 
Bridge Clinic is functioning at capacity and  the remaining patients will serve as the 
control. For example, if there is an average of five available slots for new referrals to the 
Bridge Clinic in a week,  and there is an average of 20 eligible patient discharges in a 
week, the randomization ration will be set as 1:3.  
 If the Bridge Clinic is successful in bridging buprenorphine -naloxone use (as well as IM 
naltrexone in some cases) and linking to additiona l care, it is expected to  decrease the 
overall length of stay of patients with OUD who are initi ating buprenorphine -naloxone 
therapy. This  reduction in length of stay for these patients will reduce costs and  
increases bed availability for other patients  while simultaneously providing these patients 
with the care they need.  
  
4.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Crite ria 
 
Inclusion Criteria:   
• Inpatients at VUH with active OUD being considered for MAT  who have not 
previously utilized Bridge Clinic  
• Patient accepting a transit ional prescription  for buprenorphine -naloxone or IM 
naltrexone  whose outpatient plans are not fixed  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
• Deemed ineligible for r eferral to outpatient Bridge Clinic  by [CONTACT_338679] (examples 
include by [CONTACT_338680], act ive co-occurring psychiatric 
disorders requiring a higher level of psychiatric care or patients for whom methadone maintenance is deemed the bes t choice of MAT).  
• Patients previously rand omized in this study.  
• Patients previously utilized Bridge Clini c

 The Addiction Consult Team (ACT) will be notified of potentially eligible patients via an 
EPIC consult order or referral from the general or homeless psychiatry ser vice. Those 
patients for whom an order for  an addiction medicine con sultation is placed will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_338681].  If the ACT considers MAT to be clinically a ppropriate, 
the patient does not have set plans for outpatient care,  and the patient h as not been 
previously randomized in this study, they will be enroll ed and randomized . All other 
patients will be treated with usual care without availability of referral  to the Bridge 
Clinic.  
 
Screening information from enrolled patients will be entered into REDCap. For patients 
meeting objective criteria but whom the ACT determine ineligible  for MAT, the reason 
for not enrolling them will be collected.  
 
Once eligibility  is confirmed, the patient will be randomized to being offered referral to 
the Bridge Clinic or not, as described below. Randomizat ion will occur at the i ndividual 
patient level. Randomization ratio will start at 1:1 and will be updated as necessary, but 
no more frequently than bi -weekly, to maintain the Bridge Clinic at capacity . 
 
 
6.0 Study P rocedures  
 
An enrolled patient will receiv e a referral to social wor k for “outpatient MAT” . The ACT 
social worker will approach the patients with resources for outpatient  MAT determined 
by [CONTACT_17628]  (though the social worker can escalate patients in ei ther condition to a 
higher level of care a s appropriate after randomiz ation). All patients will be offered usual 
information about outpatient MAT. Patients randomized to be eligible for referral to the 
Bridge Clinic will additionally receive information about the Bridge Clinic and this will be 
offere d as an  option during d iscussion of the plan for MAT. Patients who are randomized 
to not being offered a Bridge Clinic referr al will not receive information  about the Bridge 
Clinic and the Bridge Clinic will not  be offered as an option .  
 
Subsequent to com parator group assignmen t, patients will be followed  to measure 
outcomes . All data will be captured from the medical record, f inancial systems, state -
mandated reporting systems, and from other standard of care do cumentation.   The data 
elements to be coll ected include the followin g:

 Additional  Endpoints  collected  for 16 weeks  following randomization  
• Costs of care (total costs , and costs for each admission and care resource 
used (e.g. Bridge Clinic))  
• Linkage to MAT provider  (attending at least one visit with a MAT provider ) 
• Self-reported b uprenorphine -naloxone  (or naltrexone ) prescriptions filled

Additional  E ndpoints  for patie nts with infection suit able for outpatient management, 
collected for 16 weeks  following randomization  
• New, persistent, or r ecurrent infection (as defined by a positive culture 
and/or change in antibiotic regimen ) 
• Completion of antibiotic therapy  
• Days from negative blood culture to first hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338674]   
• Acceptance of Bridge Clinic as a bridging  provider  
• Reaso ns for ineligibility  
 
Data will be abstracted from the EMR, REDCap and the Research Derivative (RD). The 
Research Derivative is a database of clinical and related data derived from the Medical Center’s clinical systems and restructured for r esearch. Data is repurposed from VU’s 
enterprise data warehouse, which includes data from StarPanel, VPI[INVESTIGATOR_46427], and ORMIS (Operating Room Management Information System), EPIC, Medipac, and HEO among others. The medical record number and other person identifier s are preserved  within the 
database. Data types include reimbursement codes, clinical notes and documentation, nursing records, medication data, laboratory data, encounter and visit data, among others. Output may include structured data points, such as ICD  9 codes or encounter 
dates, semi -structured data such as laboratory tests and results, or unstructured data 
such as physician progress reports. The database is maintained by [CONTACT_157485], Ph.D.  
  7.0 Risks and Benefit s 
 The risks associated with this  study are limited to those associated with p rotection of 
private he alth information; beyond the randomization, the interaction with human 
subjects is limited to collecti on of data from existing records .  Allocation made by  
[CONTACT_338683]: i) inpatient MAT

 (buprenorphine  or naltrexone ) or appropriate alternative until a long -term outpatient 
MAT provider accepts the patient  (sometimes after SNF stay), or ii) inpatient MAT 
(buprenorphine  or naltrexone) or appropriate alt ernative with referral to the Bridge 
Clinic, who will maintain the p atient’s care until a long -term outpatient MAT provider 
accepts the patient. Currently, the Bridge Clinic can only accept a limited number o f 
patients  and so the choice of approach is based on availability. By [CONTACT_338684], it is possible to derive knowledge of the impact of the 
clinic on patient outcomes that would oth erwise not be discoverable  without bias. The 
results of this study  will help understan d the impact of the Bridge Clinic and be u sed as 
data for potentiall y expanding the resources and availability of the Bridge Clinic to 
additional patients  or refining ser vices to improve patient care .   
 
We expect that pati ents randomized to being eligible  for Bridge Clinic services will 
experience decrease d overall length  of stay . We also expect overall reduced costs. The 
resource savings benefit not only the study participant, but this approach will open up hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598]/beds for other patients.  
 
Risks as sociated with  the collection of personal h ealth information  (PHI)  will be 
mitigated by [CONTACT_41680] a ll reasonable efforts to keep the information private and 
confidential .  The minimum amount of health information  necessary for study conduct 
will be abstracted from the medical record .  PHI will be ente red into REDCap , which is a 
secure platform for maintaining research data. Identifiers will be needed to prevent duplicate enrol lments and to track patients through t he health syste m, but user level 
access will be set up to limit access to any identifiers only to those study person nel who 
need this access. Analysis datasets may be stored on secure servers but  will not include 
direct identifiers. Direct identifiers will  not be include d in datasets unless absolutely 
necessary.   
  
 
8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems In volving Risk 
to Participants or Others  
 
Participating in the study does not add risk related to treatment. The Bridge Clinic is 
operational and provides usual clinical care to those patients fitting within its capacity. 
All othe r processes for linking pa tients to outpatient MAT are well established. Events 
associated with MAT or other care of patients ar e clinical and not associated with the  
research. Risks to patients from participating in the study are limited to the collection  of 
PHI. We recognize ther e may be adverse events related to loss of privacy . These will be 
reported according to appropriate timelines . The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_338675] a daily basis.   
 
 9.0 Study Withdrawal/Disconti nuation 
 Because this stud y involves only observational data collection after randomization to 
Bridge Clinic or no Bridge Clinic  availability, there are no plans to wit hdraw partici pants

[ADDRESS_418693] , we will retain a copy of 
the data in a de -identified manner  to ensure rigor and r eproducibility of the research.  
 
 
10.0  Statistical Co nsiderations  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan :  
Initially, we will charact erize participants overall and grouped by [CONTACT_338685] (e.g. means with stan dard deviations, medians with interquartile 
range, and counts with percentages, as app ropriate). Data may also be described 
graphic ally. The primary analy sis will compare length of index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338676] -to-treat basis. We will compare length of stay using a generalized 
linear model  with group assignment as the primary predictor variable, with  adjustment  
for important covariates. We expect to model the outcome as a continuous outcome. We 
may choose to use a proportional hazards model or a gamma GLM with a log -link 
function if the data are substantially skewed; we do not expect this based on our 
experience wit h length of stay in this patient cohort. For secondary outcomes, costs will 
be similarly mo deled. Binary outcomes will be modeled using logistic regression, Quality 
of life outcomes will be  modeled  using a proportional odds regression . Additional 
analyses that we expect to perform include ‘per protocol’ comparisons between study 
groups and characterization of implementation measures.  
 
Power and Sa mple Size Considerations :  
We estimate [ADDRESS_418694] approximately  2/[ADDRESS_418695] appointment. Therefore , we will randomize patien ts at a 
rate of 1: [ADDRESS_418696] deviation of about 15 
days. With 700 patients in a year, allocated 1: 1, we will have about 80% power to 
detect a [ADDRESS_418697] deviation remains at about 15 days, the differenc e 
detectable with 80% power is 3.[ADDRESS_418698] deviation of 11.  However, the distribution was d ecidedly right

11.0  Privacy/Confidentiality I ssues 
 At no time during the course of this study, its analysis, or its publication will patient 
identities be reveal ed.  The minimum necessary data will be  collected and data 
containing patien t or provider id entifiers will only be obtained as required to complete 
the research .  Data will be unlinked from identifiers, usin g a unique key to facilitate 
linkage when needed.  Data will be collected  into a password -protected, secure, web -
based applica tion for managin g research data (REDCap).  All patients will be  assigned a 
unique study number for use in the computerized database .  At the time of publication 
all identifiers wil l be removed  from the archival dataset .

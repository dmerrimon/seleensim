ABSTRACT  
Context :   
Recent research has shown significant increases in suicides among Black youth and  suicide 
attempts among Black high school students .  
Objectives : 
Primary  
• To conduct a systematic adaptation of STAT -ED for Black youth presenting in the 
ED who have suicidal risk . 
• To examine preliminary efficacy of the intervention on primary (mental health 
treatment initiation and number of visits) and secondary (suicidal idea tion) outcomes 
using a prospective RCT design . 
Secondary  
• To examine implementation outcomes of  the adapted STAT -ED for Black youth and 
caregivers compared to the control condition  (enhanced Treatment as Usual) . 
Study Design :  
The study utilizes a mixed methods design which involves a qualitative phase  (interviews 
and field testing)  and RCT phase.  
Setting/Participants:  
The study will recruit from CHOP  pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193110] a total of 151 participants  (75 
youth, 75 caregivers, and 1 patient nav igator) . Eligible youth will identify as Black, be 
between the ages of [ADDRESS_229491] suicidal ideation or behaviors and are not 
currently receiving mental health treatment. Caregivers are parents or legal guardians of 
eligible youth . Patient navigator w ill be hired patient navigator who consents to being a 
secondary research participant. Study procedures may be conducted in -person, over the 
phone, or online.  
 
Study Interventions and Measures :  
Participants will be randomized to the ada pted STAT -ED or enhanced Treatment as Usual   
which will consist of follow up telephone contacts following discharge from the ED.  Main 
RCT study outcomes are mental health treatment initiation and suicidal ideation.

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 10 -24 year olds, and suicide rates are 
increasing  (Curtin & Heron , 2020 ). Historically, Black youth have had lower suicide risk; 
however, recent research has shown disturbing and significant increases over the last 3 
decades in suicides among Black youth and in self -reported suicide attempts among Black 
high school students  (Sheftall et al, 2016; Bridge et al., 2015; Bridge et al., 201 8; Ivey-
Stephenson , 2020 ;  Linds ey et al., 2018 ). Black youth are less likely than White youth to be 
treated for suicidal ideation or behaviors, and less likely to receive inpatient or outpatient 
care after a suicide attempt  (Freedenthal, 2007 ; Marrast  et al., 2016 ). Barriers to Black youth 
starting mental health treatment are myriad and include lack of perceived need, stigma, 
mistrust of providers and treatment, difficulties in physically accessing available services, 
and providers’ lack of cultural competence  (Fante-Coleman  & Jackson -Best; Planey et al., 
2019 ). Patient navigation offers a flexible model that can address many of these barriers and 
can be tailored to specific populations and needs. Although patient navigation models have 
been shown to improve outcomes such as screening and diagnostic appointment an d referral 
completions in different patient populations  (Ali-Faisal et al., 2017) , there is paucity of such 
interventions and associated research to improve care and outcomes for suicidal youth.  One 
of these patient navigation interventions, Suicidal Teens Accessing Treatment (STAT -ED) 
resulted in greater mental health care initiation and appointment at 6 months, however, 
adolescents of color were less likely to initiate mental health care than W hite adolescents  
(Grupp -Phelan et al., 2019) . An intervention for Black youth requires adaptation, as many 
interventions do not address culturally relevant issues for Black patients. This proposed 
study will adapt and pi[INVESTIGATOR_193111] -ED for Black youth pre senting to emergency 
departments (EDs) with suicidal ideation or behaviors.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_229492] or Intervention  
Patient navigation will generally be modeled after STAT -ED and can involve motivational 
interviewing, brief case ma nagement, and telephone contacts. While the complete 
intervention is contingent on our adaptations, we anticipate that the following strategies will 
be included: psychoeducation, problem -solving logistical barriers, and assistance with 
making and following  up with mental health appointments  (Godoy et al., 2019 ). As part of 
the cultural adaptation, we will directly address youth’s and caregivers’ negative perceptions 
and cultural stigma concerning mental health treatment. Psychoeducation will be provided 
on suicide risk, its negative effects, and treatment options.  The intervention will assist the 
family in following up with mental health referral recommendations provided by [CONTACT_193125]’ preferences in regards to race and gender of provid ers, convenience of 
provider, and type of treatment. This assistance could involve help with the initial telephone 
contact, getting to appointments, and preparing for the appointments. The patient navigator 
will communicate with the family in person, by [CONTACT_94725], and/or by [CONTACT_193126]’s preference. This once to twice a week communication will promote mental health 
care initiation and identify barriers and problem -solving solutions.  The intervention group is 
expected to be administered  the adapted  STAT -ED until the first mental health appointment 
   
   2 
date.  A comparison intervention (enhanced Treatment as Usual) will consist of follow up 
contacts following discharge from the ED to confirm referral recommendations.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_229493] were culturally adapted. Adaptations included 
incorporating racially diverse perspectives in intervention design, trai ning staff on cultural 
sensitivity issues, referencing racial/ethnic diversity in educational materials, and 
incorporating cultural conceptualizations of mental health  (Lee-Tauler et al., 2018) . A 
similar systematic review of psychosocial mental health int erventions for youth of color 
found that all interventions shown to be efficacious were culturally adapted  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_193112]., 
2019),  and a third review supported cultural adaptations of interventions for mental health 
care engagement among adolescent and young  adults of color  (Moore, 2018) . Although 
there are not substantial data indicating that culturally adapted interventions are more 
effective, in the mental health intervention field, the clear disparity in engaging Black 
individuals strongly suggests that c urrent approaches may not be sufficient. The CBC 
Taskforce report  on Black youth suicide and mental health  (2019)  further emphasizes this 
point, recommending that researchers develop and test interventions to mitigate suicide risk 
that are developmentally,  culturally, and linguistically relevant for Black youth  We will 
adapt a patient navigation intervention, the STAT -ED for Black youth with suicide risk, 
following the ADAPT -ITT framework steps of Assessment, Decision, Administration, 
Production, Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] E xperts and Integration, Training, and Testing  (Wingood et al., 200 8).  
This will involve data from qualitative phases of study, as well as input for advisory group 
and consultants.    
 
1.4 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance all  applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5765] 45 CFR 46. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478].  
The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain 
consent and assent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or 
others in accordance with The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175353]. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be 
accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and 
after the study.  
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The purpose of the study is to d etermine the efficacy of the  adapted STAT -ED patient 
navigation intervention for Black youth initiation of mental health treatment.   
   
   3 
2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim)   
• To conduct a systematic adaptation of STAT -ED for Black youth presenting in the 
ED, who have s uicidal risk . 
• To examine preliminary efficacy of the adapted STAT -ED on primary (mental health 
treatment initiation and number of visits) and secondary (suicidal ideation) outcomes 
using a prospective RCT design . 
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim)  
The secondary objectives are to:  
• To examine implementation outcomes of the  adapted  STAT -ED intervention 
(acceptability, feasibility, fidelity) for Black youth and caregivers compared to the 
control condition  (enhanced Treatment as Usual) . 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Design  
The study utilizes a mixed methods design which involves a qualitative phase and 
randomized trial phase. The qualitative phase consists of two steps: 1) interviews with 15 
youth and 15 caregivers and 2) field testing of the i ntervention with [ADDRESS_229494] will be conducted after an amendment to the study is approved by [CONTACT_1201].  
Medical and mental health information will be collected from medical records.  
 
Caregiver and youth interviews will be conducted separately and virtually eithe r over the 
telephone or through a CHOP approved virtual meeting platform, either Blue Jeans or 
Microsoft Teams . Interview s will be recorded. We will incorporate feedback from the youth 
and caregiver qualitative interviews as well as elicit feedback on whic h intervention 
components will be adapted and the types of cultural adaptations needed from the study 
Advisory Group (caregivers, youth, and clinicians) and a consultant.  
 
During the field testing, we will conduct as  rapid -cycling prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_193113] , materials , and delivery . This will involve conducting 
the intervention, examining recruitment strategies and gaining more information about 
mental health referral strate gies. 
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_229495], potential participants will be 
identified through three avenues  in the ED : 1) clinicians; 2) a behavioral health screening 
conducted in the ED; and 3) diagnostic codes in the electronic health record (EHR). Co-I 
Esposito, ED attending physician and ED Behavioral Health Program Director and his team 
   
   4 
will identify and recruit potential participants via three avenues: (1) all ED patients aged >12 
years complete the Behavior al Health Screen (BHS), which includes a suicidal ideation 
item; the BHS is on a web -based platform, automatically scored, integrated with patients’ 
EHR, generating automated notification to the ED clinician when the patient reports suicidal 
ideation. (2) We will peruse the EHR for an extensive list of diagnostic codes related to 
suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and self -harm to identify potential participants. (3) ED 
clinicians can refer patients with suicidal ideation or attempt. Academic Associates , CHOP 
ED staff whose primary role is to approach potential participants for clinical research, and 
study st aff will screen potential participants using protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Academic Associates and study staff  will be available in the ED  to meet with youth and 
caregivers, discuss study procedures , enroll participants  and gather consent/assent. For 
participants who meet the study eligibility criteria, we will either gather consent/assent from 
caregivers and youth in the ED  or at a later ti me by [CONTACT_193127] . If teen and/or caregiver are undecided or do not have time in ED to 
discuss study, a study flyer will be given by [CONTACT_193128]. Signed 
consent/assent forms and caregiver a nd/or youth contact [CONTACT_193129] a secure manner. Study staff will contact 
[CONTACT_193130] a 
week for the interviews .  
3.1.2 Study Treatment Phase (start of the study intervention)  
Cargiver and Youth Interviews: We develop ed an interview guide to identify barriers and 
facilitators to mental health treatment.. We  use d prompts from our conceptual model to 
query about  issues such as barriers to care that STAT -ED may address, the extent to which 
STAT -ED components address stigma, and the cultural relevance and appropriateness of 
STAT -ED components.  Interviews were conducted  and the audio was recorded  by [CONTACT_27329] s eparately for youth and caregivers.  All audio files were  stored on a  secure  CHOP 
server for the study. All audio files were sent to ADA Transcription services for 
transcription with deletion of any identifying information. The de -identified transcripts were 
returned and maintained on CHOP’s secure research server  accessed only by [CONTACT_105033] . The ADA Transcription services is a CHOP approved vendor that have been 
used before for other research studies at CHOP and will continue to be used in th e future.  
Initial codes  were developed  inductively through consensus of the investigative team. 
Themes pertaining to child and family factors and benefits and barriers to MH service use in 
a virtual environment w ere identified. We use d EHOST , an open source  software program, 
to facilitate codi ng of transcripts and identification of themes. The results  were used  to adapt 
STAT -ED content and materials in preparation for the  RCT.  The recruitment  for and 
analyses  of the interviews have been  completed .   
 
Field testing:  We use d rapid -cycle prototyp ing and testing as our field testing. This  involve d 
the study staff conducting the intervention and documenting its delivery. This  also include d 
examining mental health referral pathwaysand the study’s ability to recruit appropriate 
patients for the RCT.   The study staff  provide d feedback and observations about the 
intervention delivery and referral pathways by [CONTACT_193131]. We examine d screening 
strategies to identify patients and determine if we are capturing all appropriate patients. The 
field testing finished recruitment and is complete.   
   
   5 
 
Intervention adaptation: We develop ed an intervention draft that will balance core elements 
of the STAT -ED intervention with information gathered from the qualitative interviews and 
field testing  (Wingood et al., 2008) .  The intervention adaption was informed by [CONTACT_193132] , and the current literature . We also elicit ed feedback on 
which intervention components will be adapted and the types of cultural adaptations needed 
from t he Advisory Group and consultant s. This involve d using relevant components, as well 
as writing adaptations to current components and  new content.  The intervention will 
include patient navigator instructions, such as motivational interviewing questions, 
procedures for assisting with mental health appointments, and tips for problem solving 
barriers, and content for youth and caregivers. . The intervention manual discuss es potential 
intervention delivery strategies such as by [CONTACT_756], in -person, and by [CONTACT_193133].  A written 
manual has been developed .     
 
RCT: S tudy staff will contact [CONTACT_193134], complete baseline assessments, and 
randomize to the adapted STAT -ED or control condition  (enhanced Treatment as Usual) . 
The adapted STAT -ED will involve the following strategies: psychoeducation, motivational 
interviewing, problem solving logistical barriers, and assistance with making and following 
up with mental health appointments.  This could involve identifying additional mental health 
resource s and providers based on insurance type.  One social worker has been hired and 
trained to implement the adapted STAT -ED and the control condition  (enhanced Treatment 
as Usual)  for study.  Patient navigator will communicate with the family in person, by 
[CONTACT_162520], and/or by [CONTACT_193135]’s preference. The  control condition 
(enhanced Treatment as Usual) will receive telephone contacts to check in and remind 
families about mental health care initiation. Telephone contacts are consistent with current 
ED practice in which social work team members follow up by [CONTACT_193136].  The proposed study is a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_193114] a patient navigator intervention for suicidal Black youth and test t he preliminary 
effectiveness of the intervention in preparation for a fully -powered RCT.  We will perform 
initial analyses (chi -square and t-tests) to compare the intervention and control groups on 
proportion to initiate mental health treatment, mean number  of days to treatment initiation, 
and mean number of treatment sessions at both 2 months and 6 months follow -up. A Cox 
proportional hazards model will examine group differences in mental health utilization, time 
to treatment initiation, suicidal ideation, and mental health motivation  (Cox, 1972) . 
Assessments may be conducted in -person, via telephone, or electronically/online.  At the end 
of the study, we will also solicit and review feedback from the patient navigator  who is 
research staff mem ber about feasibility and acceptability.  The patient navigato r will also 
complete fidelity measure after first session of the adapted STAT -ED. 
Partici pants may be recontact[CONTACT_193137].  
3.[ADDRESS_229496] , subjects will be randomized to either the adapted STAT -ED or to enhanced 
treatment as usual.  Randomization will be accomplished in advance using computer -
   
   6 
generated rand om numbers. Allocation concealment (blinding of the treatment assignment) 
will be implemented using sealed, opaque envelopes . 
3.[ADDRESS_229497] will 
be up to  8 months , with up to 1 month  screening, up to  6 months for  baseline assessments 
and intervention delivery , and  2 months for  study visits completion . 
3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
The study will be conducted at approximately  [ADDRESS_229498] will stop when approximately  100 participants (50 youth -caregiver 
dyads)  are enro lled. It is expected that approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled to 
produce 85 evaluable subjects.  Recruitment for interviews will stop when approximately 30 
participa nts (15 youth -caregiver dyads)  are enrolled and recruitment for field testing will 
stop when approximately 10 (5youth -caregiver dyads) are enrolled .

may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator for lack of 
adherence to the study visit schedule or any AEs.  The Investigator ma y also withdraw 
subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for reasons of safety or for 
administrative reasons. It will be documented whether or not each subject completes the 
study. If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, rel ated adverse events after the 
subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source 
documents and on the CRF.

5.1.2 Other Evaluations, Measures  
Qualitiative Interviews   
• Qualitative  interview guide  will be developed. Questions concerning perceptions 
and preferences of mental health treatment and barriers and facilita tors to 
accessing mental health services will be asked of participants.  
• Demographic s survey  will gather information such as  age, biological sex, 
gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and family income.  
 
 
Field Testing  
• Demographic s survey  will gather information such as  age, biological sex, 
gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and family income.  
• Patient navigation notes  
 
RCT  
 
 
   
   11 
• ED STARS  mental health service use  is a 8-item interview that measures mental 
health services children receive and actions taken by [CONTACT_193140]. 
This measure was used with over 6000 adolescents from the Pediatric 
Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN)  that spanned diverse 
geographic regions of the US  (King et al., 2020) . Cargeivers will complete this 
interview  unless youth is participating without a parent.   
 
• Motivation for Youth’s Treatment Scale (MYTS)  is an 8 -item measure of 
intrinsic treatment motivation that has both youth and parent reports  (Breda et 
al., 2012) .  It has two subscales:  recognition that the youth has a problem and 
readiness to participate in the youth’s treatment. It has good internal consistency 
and validity with support for the factors. MYTS has a 5 -point Likert scale with 
higher scores representing higher motivation. MTYS will be completed by [CONTACT_193141].  
• Suicide Ideation Questionnaire -Junior  (SIQ -Jr) is a youth report measure of 
frequency of suicidal thoughts over the last month  (Reynolds, 1988) . SIQ -Jr has 
high internal consistency, test -retest reliability, predictive validity for suicidal 
behavior, and is sensitive to change  (Reynolds & Mazza, 1998) .    
• Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), a 4 -item, psychometrically -
validated measure that indexes the extent to which stakeholders believe an 
intervention is acceptable .  Both youth and a caregiver will rate the intervention 
helpfulness  and satisfaction. Additionally, the patient navigator  will complete 
the AIM  after the tri al is completed.  
• Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)  is a widely used and validated 
measure (Watson et al., 1988).  It has been used for adolescent samples with 
evidence of potentially three factors: Positive Affect, Negative affect with two 
factors  of Distress and Fear (Villodas et al., 2011; Allan et al., 2015 ). The 
Positive Affect factor will be administered to youth.   
• Demographic s survey  will gather information such as  age, biological sex, 
gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, family income, religion, and insurance 
type.  Same demographic survey will be used for interviews and field testing.  
Another demographic survey will be used for RCT . 
• Feasibility  of Intervent ion Measure ( FIM), a [ADDRESS_229505]  has been developed to assess self -reported task completion by [CONTACT_193142] (0 - not completed, 1 - partially completed, 2 - fully completed). This will be 
completed after  the  interview .  
5.[ADDRESS_229506], t hese are the measures that will be used to assess efficacy (mental health 
utilization) - ED STARS .  The three primary efficacy outcomes are 1) whether the patient 
initiated mental health treatment (yes/no), 2) time to treatment initiation, and 3) number of 
   
   [ADDRESS_229507], ED 
STARS  is an interview and will be administered by [CONTACT_193143] 2 (Study 
visit 2) and 6 months (final visit) after baseline assessment.  SIQ -Jr is a self -report measure  
that will be administered to youth at baseline  and [ADDRESS_229508], p articipant safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_193144] -Jr.  It will 
also include responses on the intervention satisf action.  
 
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
Primary endpoint for qualitative phase (interviews and field testing):  themes of caregiver 
and youth mental health attitudes and engagement and an adapted STAT -ED manual  
Primary endpoint for randomized trial: mental health treatment initiation. The three primary 
efficacy outcomes are: a) whether the patient initiated mental health treatment (yes/no), b) 
time to treatment initiation, and c) number of treatment sessions attended.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_229509], d escriptive statistics for demographic and behavioral characteristics measured 
at basel ine will be examined across the two treatment groups to assess the success of the 
randomization.  
 
6.3.2 Efficacy Analysis  
These are the measures that will be used to assess efficacy (mental health utilization), ED 
STARS .  The three primary efficacy outcomes are 1) whether the patient initiated mental 
health treatment (yes/no), 2) time to treatment initiation, and 3) number of treatment 
sessions attended. Other outcomes are suicidal ideation and behavior  which will be 
examined by [CONTACT_193145] f rom baseline to Visit [ADDRESS_229510], we followed established rules of thumb for pi[INVESTIGATOR_193115] -
armed studies to determine our total sample size of 100  (Whitehead et al., 201 6). Even 
accounting for greater than 15% attrition, power analyses  (Faul et al., 2009)  indicate that this 
sample size will produce 80% power to detect a large effect for group differences between 
conditions over time ( f = .72). This pi[INVESTIGATOR_193116]; rather, the primary aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_193117] a fully -powered RCT. The effect sizes obtained in 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_193118] a subse quent R01 to inform sample 
size considerations.  
 
7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are  not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen 
during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported to the IRB in 
accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. 
AEs that do not meet prompt reporting requirements will be summarized in narrative or 
other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review  (if continuing 
reviews are required), or will be tracked and documente d internally by [CONTACT_193146] (if continuing reviews are not required) .

8 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
8.1 Treatment Assignment Methods  
8.1.1 Randomization  
Randomization will be accomplished in advance using computer -generated random 
numbers. Al location concealment (blinding of the treatment assignment) will be 
implemented using sealed, opaque envelopes . 
 
8.1.2 Blinding  
Allocation concealment (blinding of the treatment assignment) will be implemented using 
sealed, opaque envelopes to prevent staff and participants from manipulating the 
randomization.     
 
8.[ADDRESS_229511] privacy. All data for these study procedures will 
be maintained on CHOP /Penn/NIH  secure server s, and all analyses will be performed on de -
identified data only. All  collected study measures will be entered directly into a REDCap 
database maintained and protected on this secure research server. Any paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_193119] s at CHOP . Recordings of interviews 
will be store d on a password protected secured server s at CHOP /Penn  to be coded and 
analyzed. All audio files will be sent to ADA Transcription services for transcription with 
deletion of any identifying information. The de -identified transcripts will be returned and 
maintained on CHOP’s secure research server  with regular backup . The ADA Transcription 
services is a CHOP approved vendor that have been used before for other research studies at 
CHOP and will continue to be used in the future.  A master list, linking the st udy data with 
subject PHI will be stored separately  from the data in a password -protected file on a secure 
CHOP drive accessible only to the study team.  Participants’ information will be stored in 
the REDCap database and configured to export data without  PHI. The coded  data may be 
shared with the study sponsor , University of Pennsylvania , other other research staff at 
CHOP/Penn for current or future research purposes . Every 6 months, the study sponsor 
NIMH requires a data transfer to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). During the course of the 
study and after its completion, the research team will send coded  data to the NDA repository 
where it will be stored and managed. Addit ionally, any necessary study data will be 
transmitted accordingly to Clinicaltrials.gov.  Identifiable and non -identifiable information 
may be stored for future research purposes indefinitely . 
8.[ADDRESS_229512] obtai ning IRB approval  or determination of exemption . The 
investigator will obtain a data use agreement between the provider (the PI) of the data and 
any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_66945] a limited dataset.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_229513] (DSMB) that was developed for the Center. 
The DSMB will meet regularly to review the study progress, review modifications, and 
monitor compliance with IRB rules, human subjects’ procedures, OHRP regulations, and 
plan for rules for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_193120].  This project will be under the Penn Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_193121]. 
Its members and their credentials will be submitted to the University of Pennsylvania IRB 
and to NIMH prior to any Project accruing human research participants. The DS MB will 
comprise at least four members with expertise in clinical psychiatry, mental health services 
research, biostatistics, and bioethics. The DSMB will hold scheduled annual meetings in 
person or virtually to review any INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_193122] a clinical trial by 
[CONTACT_175716]. These will be supplemented by [CONTACT_193147] a particular 
project(s) during the year, as needed. The DSMB will review and approve the research 
protocol and examine progress annually.  
 
8.4.2 Risk Assessment  
The study procedure  risks are not greater than minimal.  The research involves the collection 
of sensitive and protected health information from participants. The risk of participation is 
considered minimal. There is a potential risk of breach of confidentia lity of information and 
study results about individuals. This risk is minimized by [CONTACT_193148]: use of secure files, storing data on secure computers, using unique 
study identifiers, using only coded data for analysis, and obtaining a Certificate of 
Confidentiality through NIH. A second risk is that participants may become uncomfortable 
in completing study measures. The risks to participants of the measures and intervention are 
similar to those associated with receiving care coordinating services for mental health 
treatment referral. The discussion of personal and sensitive material (e.g., mental health) 
may make participants uncomfortable. The participants’ right to refuse to answer questions 
or discontinue a p rocedure will be communicated to them and respected and considered to 
be an essential component of maintaining a positive study experience for the participant. 
   
   16 
Some further potential risks to participants include disclosing child abuse/neglect, suicidal 
ideation and behaviors, and homicidal ideation. Additionally, the family’s routine activities 
may be disrupted slightly because of participation in the study. Participants will not be 
deceived in any way about the nature of the study or reimbursement. Suicid al ideation and 
behavior are risk factors for suicide attempt or death. Therefore, there is increased risk of 
suicide among the participants regardless of their participation in the study.  
 
Should suicidal ideation or behaviors or functioning worsen, we wi ll implement a suicide 
prevention plan to assess immediate risk for harm. Participant will be  assess ed for  suicidal 
risk and determine next steps, such as contact[CONTACT_193149], revising safety plan and/or 
referral to Emergency Department at a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_17399] l for evaluation for psychiatric 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Should child maltreatment be suspected, study staff will comply with all 
mandated reporting laws.  
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_229514], y outh assigned to the intervention arm will receive patient 
navigation services to potentially reduce barrier s to receiving mental health treatment. 
Additionally, the youth in the control condition  (enhanced Treatment as Usual)  will receive 
telephone contacts which may benefit their receipt of mental health treatment. There are 
benefits to society for increasing the understanding of motivation for obtaining mental 
health treatment and providing more culturally informed care, whi ch may help to increase 
service utilization among the underserved population of Black youth at risk for suicide.   
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_229515] participants and 
schedule study visit 1 ( intervention session for field testing and baseline assessme nt for 
RCT ). For the RCT, a study flyer will be given to families who are undecided about the 
study or do not have time to be enrolled in the ED  
All recruitment materials will be IRB approved.  
8.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization  
Parent/legal  guardian  consent and child assent will be obtained for study participation.  
Consent will may be collected in -person or remotely and may be documented on paper or 
electronically . A waiver of screening consent is being requested to screen medica l records 
for inclusion/exclusion.  For the qu alitative interviews, f or youth age [ADDRESS_229516] after the youth reaches the age of majority .  For youth between 10 -17 years of age, 
youth assent and parental/ legal guardian consent will be attained. For the field testing and 
RCT, for youth ages [ADDRESS_229517] after the youth reaches the age of 
majority.  For youth between 10 -13 years of age, youth assent and parental/ legal guardian 
consent will be attained. Participation in the study will be completely voluntary, and 
participants will have the study rationale and goals explained to them, as well as the 
requir ements for participation, the risks and benefits of participation, and alternatives to 
participation. This is done by [CONTACT_193150]. Should any participant become intolerant of any aspect of the 
study or an exclusionary condition be identified, their participation will be discontinued.  If 
potential participants  want additional time to consider  study participation, they can be 
contact[CONTACT_6811] a later time by [CONTACT_193151]. There is no time limit for  consent and  
participation  as long as that phase of the study is still active. Parent consent and child assent 
also will be gathered for the qualitative interview consent form for their w illingness to 
participate in the field testin g study procedures. If consent is gathered in person, research 
staff will be given a hard copy of  the signed consent form .  In the event that  the participants 
are not seen in person , an alternative method of obt aining informed consent will be used. 
Eligible participants will be sent the informed consent document electronically through 
REDCap. The study team will then go over the document in detail with the eligible 
parents/legal guardians and youth . The e -consent  function in REDCap will be used to obtain 
the parent/legal guardian’s  signature. The signed e -consent will then be stored within 
REDCap, and a copy of the form will be available to download and emailed securely to the 
family.  
 
   
   18 
Verbal Consent from patient navigators  
Informed Consent of patient navigator s will be obtained verbally. The aforementioned 
patient navigators are employed at CHOP and will not be paid for their participation as a 
secondary research participant. A waiver of documentation of c onsent is being requested for 
these participants. Verbal consent will be documented internally by [CONTACT_193152] a 
Consent Affirmation Note. Informed consent will be conducted by a study team member 
(other than a principal investigator ) so that the p atient navigators does not feel pressure to be 
a secondary research participant. The provider will have no direct reporting relationship to 
the study team member that obtains informed consent from them. Those noted are research 
study team members as well a s secondary research subjects. They will be provided with a 
verbal consent form outlining what their participation as a research subject will entail . 
Participation will include the completion of surveys of feasibility and acceptability of the 
intervention and the completion of fidelity checklists.   Completion of fidelity checklists is a 
widely accepted, standard practice in the delivery of a behavioral intervention to monitor 
adherence to an intervention manual  and part of routine practice at CHOP . These ch ecklists 
will be used in the clinical supervision of the  patient navigator  and for research purpose s. 
However, participants can choose to not have their fidelity checklist data used beyond 
clinical supervision purposes (i.e., for research purposes).   Participants will be given time to 
ask questions and make an informed decision regarding their completion of the feasibility 
and satisfaction surveys and use of the “data” from the fidelity checklists  for research 
purposes. No HIPAA related information will be  gathered from the patient navigators.

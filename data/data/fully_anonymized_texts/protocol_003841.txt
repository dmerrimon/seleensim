Cohort 7:  20 mg/kg IV Q4W for up to 72 weeks
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protoco l Page 3
LY3002813Each cohort will contain approximately 6(single dose) or9 (multiple dose) patients treated with LY3002813 and [ADDRESS_488410] target engagement and antidrug antibody (ADA) 
frequency  relative to those observed in Study I5T-MC-AACC.
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion:   
The study  will enroll men or nonfertile women, at least [ADDRESS_488411] with Immediate Recall ( FCSRT-IR), a Mini –Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) 16 to 30, a Clinical Dementia Rating of0.5 to 2 and memory box score ≥0.5, no history of 
macrohemorrhage and no more than 4 microhemorrhages on MRI, and a positive amyloid scan by [CONTACT_389754].  
Patients with contraindication for MRI, presence of >4 microhemorrhages on MRI, or history or evidence on MRI 
of macrohemorrhage will be excluded.  Criteria for Japanese patients:  Japanese if recruited at sites in Japan or up 
tothird-generation Japanese if recruited at sites outside of Japan.  “Third-generation Japanese ”is defined as a 
patient whose biological grandparents are of exclusi ve Japanese descent and wereborn in Japan.
Investigational Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:   
LY3002813, single and multiple doses, from 10mg/kg up to 40mg/kg, IV infusion
Comparator, Dose, and Mode of Administration:   
Placebo (saline), IV infusion
Planned Duration of Treatment:   
Part A (Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 ):  single dose of LY3002813 or placebo followed by 72 weeks(for Coho rts 1 and 2) 
and 24 weeks (for Cohort 3) follow-up for each dose level
Part B (Cohorts 4 and 5 ): 13doses of LY3002813 or placebo administered Q2Wfor 24 weeks followed by 
48-weeks follow -up
Part C (Cohorts 6 and 7 ): 19doses of LY3002813 or placebo administered Q4W for 72 weeks followed by 
12-weeks follow -up
Criteria for Evaluation:   
Safety:  Safety parameters that willbe assessed include AEs, concomitant medications , cognitive function, physical 
and neurological examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram , safety laboratory values, and MRI scans .
Bioanalytical:Serum and CSF samples will be used to determine concentrations of LY3002813.  Serum a nd CSF 
concentrations of LY3002813 will be determined by [CONTACT_157768]-linked immunosorbent assay .
Pharmacogenomics :  A blood sample will be used to test for genetic variants that may influence response to 
treatment.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic :  Blood and CSF samples will be used to determine the concentrations of 
LY3002813.   Cortical standardized uptake value r atio (SUVr) from florbetapir and 18F -AV-1451 positron 
emission tomography scans will be analyzed to estimate mean change.  The CSF results from the lumbar puncture s 
taken pre-and postinfusion will be analyzed to estimate the mean change from preinfusion.  The dependent 
variables are Atotal tau, and phospho -tau.
Statistical Evaluation Methods:   
Up to approximately 150 patients may be enrolled to ensure that a minimum of approximately 72 patients complete 
the study.  The sample size is customary for studies evaluating safety, PK, and/or PD parameters; at the concl usion 
of the trial, confidence intervals for PK, PD, and cognition endpoints may be computed in order to evaluate the 
precision of the estimates where appropriate.   In addition ,based on prior Lilly clinical trials, 6 patients randomized 
to each LY3002813 dose and placebo provide over 90% power to detect at least a 17% mean florbetapir SUVr 
reduction of a dose compared to placebo without multiple comparison adjustment.
Statistical :  PK/PD analyses will be conducted on the full analysis set.  This set includ es all data from all 
randomized patients receiving at least [ADDRESS_488412] according to the treatment the patients 
actually received.  Safety analyses will be conducted for all enrolled patients, whether or not they complete all 
protocol requirements.  A model-based approach of analysis will be used.   Summary statistics, data tabulations, 
and data graphs by [CONTACT_124940](Japanese and non -Japanese) will be provided as appropriate.
Safety:  The safety  parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics.  Additional 
analysis will be performed if warranted upon review of the data.
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protoco l Page 4
LY3002813Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic :  Noncompartmental analysis will be conducted ,and PKparameter estimates 
of clearance and half -life will be reported for LY3002813.  Compartmental modeling using nonlinear 
mixed-effects modeling or other appropriate software may be explored ,and population estimates for clearance and 
central volume of distr ibution maybe reported.  Depending on the model selected, other PK parameters may also 
be reported.  Exploratory graphical analyses of the effect of dose level or demographic factors on PK parameters 
may be conducted.  Additional modeling may be performed based on the results of the graphical analyses.  
Exploratory graphical analyses relating LY3002813 serum exposure toLY3002813 CSF concentrations may be 
conducted.  Exploratory analyses may be conducted to describe the relationship between serum or CSF ex posure 
and changes in the florbetapir SUVr, as well as relationships with cognitive endpoints, ADA, AEs, and/or plasma 
and CSF biomarkers. Additional exploratory analyses of the data may be conducted if deemed appropriate.
The relationship between the pre sence (or absence) of ADAsand clinical parameters (including AEs, PD 
measurements, and PK estimates of LY3002813) may be assessed.  The relationship of ADA titers on these 
parameters also may be assessed.
Exploratory:  Alzheimer’ s Disease Assessment Scale -Cognitive Subscale, Clinical Dementia Rating —Sum of 
Boxes, MMSE, Neuropsycho logical Test Battery, Alzheimer’ s Disease Cooperative Study -Mild Cognitive 
Impairment -Activities of Daily Living scale, and FCSRT-IR may be analyzed using a mixed model repeated
measure with pre -infusion cognitive measures as a baseline covariate and fixed effects of dose and study visit.  In 
addition, the pre-infusionflorbetapir SUV rmaybe used as a covariate inan exploratory analysis of change from 
pre-infusion cognitive mea sures in order to assess the baseline variation and change from baseline variation in the 
florbetapir SUVr and cognitive measures .

LY3002813A Single-and Multiple -Dose Study  to Assess the Safety , 
Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacody namics of 
Single and Multiple I ntravenous Doses of LY3002813 in 
Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer’s 
Disease or Mild to Moderate A lzheimer’s Disease
5.Introduction
5.1.General Introduction
LY3002813 is an ant ibody directed at the py roglutamate modification of the third amino acid of 
amyloid beta (N3pG Aβ) epi[INVESTIGATOR_389734].  It i s being 
studied for the treatm ent of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  The mechanism of act ion of LY3002813 
is considered to be the targeting and remova l of existing amylo id plaque, which is a key 
pathological hallmark of AD.  The clinical strategy for LY3002813 target sthe N3pG Aβ specific 
to amyloid plaque in the population of mild cognit ive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild to 
moderate AD pati ents with existing brain amylo id load,as measured using the amylo id plaque 
biomarker, florbetapir.  This rationale is based on the amylo id hypothesis of AD, which states 
that the production and deposit ion ofamyloid-β (Aβ)is an early and necessary event in the 
pathogenesis of AD.  Clinical support for this hypothesis comes fro m the demonstration that 
parenchymal A βlevels are elevated beforethe appearance of symptoms of AD.  Furthermore, 
early in the disease, the presence of brain amylo id appears to increase the risk of conversio n 
from MCI to AD.  It i s implicit in this hypothesis that enhanced clearance o f Aβ plaques will 
lead to ameliorat ion of AD symptoms and slow progression of AD.
The biomarker florbetapir is a positron emissio n tomography (PET) ligand that binds to fibrillar 
amyloid plaque.  Thi s biomarker can provide a qualitat ive and quant itative measurement of brain 
plaque load in pat ients with AD or MCI due to AD.  The absence of significant florbetapir signal 
indicates that those patients clinically man ifesting MCI or dement ia lack evidence of amylo id 
pathology,which is a hallmark of the disease and the target of LY3002813 treatment .  As such, 
implementation of florbetapir will provide a screening tool for entry  into early clinical trials and 
provide a more homogeneous pati ent popul ation for assessment of the risk of targeting plaques.   
Florbetapir PET also provi des quant itative assessment of amylo id deposition in the brain and can 
serve as a pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker of clearance of amylo id deposits.
The safety of LY3002813 was assessed in a 6 -week toxi city study in cynomolgus monkeys, 
including evaluat ions of safet y pharmacology and toxicokinetics.  The administration of 
LY3002813 in monkeys of up to a maximum dose of 100 mg/kg/week (bo lus intravenous [IV]) 
for 6weeks resulted in no drug- related findings.  Repeat -dose hazard ident ification studies of up 
to 6months’duration were conducted in the aged PDAPP (APPV717F) transgenic mouse model 
of Aβ deposi tion to invest igate potential effects related to clearance of Aβ fro m the brain.  In 
addition, a speci alized 3-month study to investigate the potential for cerebral am yloid angiopathy 
(CAA)-associated microhemorrhage was conducted in aged PDAPP transgenic mice.  These 
studies in the PDAPP mouse were conducted with mE8c (LSN3026818), a murine analog
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protoco l Page [ADDRESS_488423] identification studies in PDAPP mice at mE8c doses of up to 100 m g/kg/week (the 
highest dose tested ).  Treatment of PDAPP mice wit h mE8c at 12.5 m g/kg/week for 3 months 
did not exacerbate CAA -associated microhem orrhage at a dose that produced a maximum 
pharmaco logical response (reduction in deposited brain Aβ) in these animals.
The first human dose study  of LY3002813 was I5T-MC-AACC(Study AACC).  Study AACC 
was a Phase 1,patient-and invest igator-blind, randomized within cohort, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, single -dose followed by [CONTACT_27873]-dose, dose -escalation study in patients with 
MCI due to AD or mild tomoderate AD to assess the safety, tolerability, PD,and 
pharmacokinet ics (PK)of single and mult iple IV doses of LY3002813.  The study  included 
Japanese and non -Japanese pat ients.  Patients with AD were enrolled into the single -ascending 
dose (SAD) phase and were each administered a single IV dose of LY3002813 (5 dosing cohorts 
from 0.1 mg/kg IV to 10 mg/kg IV) or placebo fo llowed by  a 12-week follow-up period for each 
dose level.  After the follow -up period, the sam e patients proceeded into the mult iple-ascending 
dose (MAD) phase (5 cohorts) and were administered IV doses of LY3002813 (0.3 mg/kg IV to 
10mg/kg IV; subjects in the 0.1 mg/kg SAD cohort received 0.3 mg/kg in the MAD phase ) or 
placebo approximately  once per m onth for up to 4 doses ,depending on the init ial doselevel.  
This phase concluded wit h a 12-week follow-up period.  The relative exposure assessment of an 
unblinded single subcutaneous ( SC)dose of 3 mg/kg LY3002813 in AD pat ients was also 
performed, followed by a 12 -week follow-up assessment study .  This cohort did not continue to 
the MAD phase.
Under aprotocolamendment, the PK of an unblinded single IV dose of 1 mg/kg LY3002813 in 
young, healt hy male subjects was assessed to determine whether the absence of the amyloid 
target affected the PK as compared to amylo id-positive AD pati ents.
In the SAD portion of Study  AACC, i t was observed that LY3002813 had asignificantly shorter 
half-life than the approximately 24- dayhalf-lifepredicted based on data from nonclinical studies
(a prediction that was consistent with the expected half- life of an immunogl obulin G1antibody
[Lobo et al. 2004] ).  After single -dose administration from 0.1 mg/kg to 3.0 mg/kg, the mean 
terminalelimination half-life was approximately 4 days, increasing to approximately 10 days 
(243hours) at the 10 -mg/kg dose level.  The PK of a single dose of 1.0 mg/kg IV LY3002813 in 
young, healt hy subjects was indist inguishable from the PK in AD patients at t he same dose level.  
In the MADphase, most patients at dose levels ≤3 mg/kg had serum  LY3002813 concentrations 
below the limits of detection 28 days after dosing; patients receiving 10 mg/kg did have 
sustained quant ifiable concentrations 28 days after dos ing.  
Greater than 90% of the patients with AD had treatment -emergent antidrug ant ibodies (ADAs)
3months after the first dose at all dose groups; titers tended to increase by  [CONTACT_389755] [ADDRESS_488424] dose .  Dosing was stopped in the MAD phase of 
StudyAACC because of high prevalence of ADAs and unexpected rapid eliminat ion of the study  
drug.  
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protoco l Page 18
LY3002813Sixteen adverse events ( AEs) of mild or moderate infusio n related reacti ons were reported in 6 of 
51patients dosed wi th LY3002813.  Infusio n reactions occurred in 1 patient in the 0.3 -mg/kg 
cohort, 2 patients in the 1.0 -mg/kg cohort, and 3 patients in the 3.0- mg/kg cohort.  The infusio n 
reactions developed in [ADDRESS_488425] MAD dose and in 5 of the 6 patients after 
the second MAD dose.  One patient discont inued because of dyspnea due to an infusion reaction
(mild severity).  All patients with infusion reactions had high peak titers of ADAs .  Three 
patients were rechallenged with premedicat ion (acetaminophen, ant ihistamine, and/or 
hydrocortisone) and had milder reactions on rechallenge.   Infusion reactions began during t he 
infusion or within 30 minutes of complet ing the infusio n and lasted between 1 minute and 
8hours.  Symptoms included chills /shivering(3patients); flushing (2 patients); hypotensio n 
(asymptom atic, 1 patient); dy spnea (1 pati ent); myal gia (1patient); rash (1 patient); and fever 
(1patient).
LY3002813 was generally well tolerated when administered up to 10 mg/kg.   There were no 
drug-related serious adverse events ( SAEs)reported.  Aside fro m the subject who withdrew from 
the study because of an infusio n reaction AE described above, no other subject withdrew from 
the study because of an AE .  There were a total of 88 treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs)reported irrespect ive of causalit y.  The most commo n TEAEs (n =2 or greater) were
infusion related reaction (n =16), fall (n =5), headache (n =4), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_389735] (n=4), upper respi [INVESTIGATOR_40938] n (n=3), amylo id related imaging 
abnormalities (ARIAs, n =2),diarrhea (n =2), dizziness (n =2), eczem a (n=2), nausea (n =2), 
urinary tract infect ion (n=2) and delirium (n =2).  Of these, there were a total of [ADDRESS_488426] commo n drug rela ted 
TEAEs were infusio n related reaction (n =16) and delirium (n =2).Two cases of asymptomat ic 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalit ies-microhemo rrhage (ARIA -H) were detected by  [CONTACT_12705] ( MRI):  (1) a pati ent in the 3 -mg/kg IV cohort had a right temporal 
microhemorrhage at baseline; a new asymptomatic right external capsule microhemorrhage was 
detected by  [CONTACT_66577] 6 m onths and was unchanged 1 month later; (2) a patient in the 3- mg/kg SC 
single-dose cohort had right temporal, right parietal, and left occipi[INVESTIGATOR_389736]; asymptomatic newright 
parietal microhemorrhage and ischemic white matter lesio ns were detected by  [CONTACT_9268]1 month after 
dosing and were unchanged 1 month later.  There were no clinically significant findings in 
electrocardi ograms (ECGs), vital signs,and safety  laboratory tests. 
Florbetapir scans were performed at baseline and after the last MAD, separated by  [CONTACT_3450] 
7months,to assess the PD effects of LY3002813 .  The change in grey  matter standardi zed 
uptake val ue ratio (SUVr) wi th cerebellum  as a reference regio n was compared across dose 
cohorts.  There was a highly significant reduction in cerebral amylo id by [CONTACT_389756] 
(p<.0002).  The analysis showed consistent reduction in cortical amylo id among patients 
receiving 3 to 5 doses of 10 mg/kg LY3002813.  The mean reduction of 1 7% in SUVr 
corresponds to a mean 50% reduction in brain amylo id.  Meaningful target engagement (amylo id 
reduction) was likely not achieved at doses smaller than or equal to 3 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks 
(Q4W)because of the rapid eliminat ionof LY3002813 and th e lack of sustained exposure.

the IB.
5.2.Rationale and Justification for the Study
This is the second study  with LY3002813 in patients with MCI due to AD or mild to moderate 
AD.  Data from Study AACC indicated a dramatic reduction in cerebral amylo id (as assessed by  
[CONTACT_389757]) in the 6 patients who received 3 to 5 doses of 10 mg/kg of LY3002813
IV over 6 months, without cerebral vasogenic edema or microhemorrhage complicationsin this 
dose group .  These posit ive results were acco mpanied by a high incidence of ADA sat all doses, 
as well as infusio n reactions noted at doses ≤3mg/kg.  Dosing was stopped in the mult iple-dose 
phase of Phase 1 Study  I5T-MC-AACC (Study  AACC) due to hi gh prevalence of ADAs and 
unexpected rapid clearance of the study  drug.
As a result of the significant target engagement (amyloid reduction by [CONTACT_389758]) that was 
identifiedafter 3 to 5 doses of LY3002813 10 mg/kg IV over 6 months, the current study is 
proposed to determine whether different dosing regimens (single -dose, short -term “induction” 
dosingwith higher, m ore frequent dosing ;and chroni c dosing for m aximal PD effect) can 
mitigate immunogenicit y and immune safet yissues,and produce sustained amylo idreduction.  
The aims o f the study are to eval uate the effect of different dosing regimens on ADAs and 
amyloid plaque removal, andassess the rel ationship between PK, PD (amylo id removal), 
immunogenicit y, and clinical safety.  As a high prevalence of ADAs was observed in 
StudyAACC, a risk management pl an for immune safet ywill be incorporated into the clinical 
trial including at least 6 hours monitoring after completion of each infusion,a protocol  for 
management of infusio n reactions, and standardized data collection for infusio n reaction AEs.
A favorable risk/benefit profile and dosing select ion will support further development of 
LY3002813 , including:  (1) removal o f amyloid consistent wi th Study AACC; (2) persistence of 
amyloid removal after com pletion of dosing; (3) acceptable clinical impact of ADAs; 
(4)manageable risk of clinically  significant infusion reacti ons; and (5) l ow incidence of 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalit ies-edema (ARIA-E)and ARIA-H.

I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protoco l Page [ADDRESS_488431] 2 doses each of LY3002813 safely in Cohort 6.  
Safety/PK reviews will occur after a minimum of [ADDRESS_488432] 1 hour. Each cohort will contain
approximately 6 (single dose) or 9(multiple dose) patients treated with LY3002813 and [ADDRESS_488433] target engagement and ADA frequency 
relative to those observed in Study AACC.
The primary  target engagement outcome is the reduction of cerebral amylo id as measured by  
[CONTACT_389760] ( florbetapi[INVESTIGATOR_389738]) assessed at baseline andat 12 weeks , 
24weeks, 36weeks, 48weeks, and 72weeksafter starting treatm ent.  The early postbaseline 
scans are aimedtoassess the time course of amylo id reduction; the later scans are aimedto
assess sustainabilit y of amylo id reduction after complet ion of dosing in Parts A and B, and 
maximal amylo id removal in Part C.
Safety and PK of LY3002813 will be assessed throughout the study  for each cohort.  In addition, 
blood sam ples for the assessment of immunogenicity  will be taken at regular intervals 
throughout the dosin g and follow-up periods.  For Cohorts 1 through 3, a CSF sample will be 
taken by [CONTACT_389761] (LP) at baseline ,another approximately 3days after dosing to 
measure the CSF concentration of LY3002813 and CSFbiomarkers. For Cohorts [ADDRESS_488434] dose if
treatment is stopped earlier .
As noted previously , a high prevalence of ADAs was observed in Study AACC; therefore, a risk 
management plan for immune safet y isincorporated into the clinical trial .  Other safety 
monitoring in Study AACDwill include serial MRIsbeginning at baseline and followingdosing 
according to the study  schedule for assessment of amyloid-related imaging abnormalit ies, AEs, 
ECGs, vital signs (bloodpressure, pulserate, and temperature ), physical examinat ions, 
neurological examinations, and safety laboratory  tests of blood (including immunogenicit y).
Exploratory assessments include CSF, serum, and plasma bio markers;cognitive function;MRI
measures;18F-AV-1451tau PET scan (optional for Japan si tes); and genet ic interactions.
7.1.1.Screening for all Cohorts
At Visit 1,patients will undergo thescreening tests outlined in Attachment 1 .  Upon fulfilling the 
screening criteria at Visit 1, the patient willundergo a screening MRI (Visit 2) and then a 
screening florbetapir PET scan (Visit 3), sequent ially, provided that the MRI cri teria are met 
beforethe PET scan occurs.  If the patient’s eligibilit y is confirmed by  a positive florbetapir PET 
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protoco l Page 24
LY3002813scan, then this scan serves as their baseline PET scan .  Patients may undergo som e or all of the 
predose testing, including cognit ive testing and LP as an outpatient or inpat ient (Visit4).  
Cognitive testing requires a minimum of [ADDRESS_488435] between the Alzheimer’s Disease 
Assessment Scale –Cognitive Subscale (ADAS -cog) and Neuropsy chological Test Battery  
(NTB) to avoid test fatigue ;ideally, cognit ive testing should occur before LP if on the same day, 
and LP should occur no closer than [ADDRESS_488436]-LP headache.  Patien ts should be 
admitted on Day 1,but may be admitted to the siteon Day -1(the day beforethe first dosing 
day).
7.1.2.Dosing for all Cohorts
For each dosing day, patients will remain resident atthe sitefor a minimum o f 6 hours from the 
end of infusio n, during which time patients will be monitored for safet yand,in particular ,for 
infusion reactions. If deemed necessary for safet y or feasibilit y reasons, patients may  remain at 
the site for a longer dura tion (including an overnight stay ), at the discretion of the investigator . 
7.1.3.Part A:  Single Dose Cohorts (Cohorts 1 through 3)
Safety, PK,and PD will be assess edin Cohorts 1 through 3 after single doses of LY3002813 or 
placebo.  The planned doses are 10, 20,and 40 mg/kg IV for Cohorts 1, 2 ,and 3, respectively ;
with 8 patients(6 LY3002813 ;2 placebo)planned to be enro lled in each cohort. Dose escalat ion 
will only occur after the safet y from the preceding cohort has been established in at least [ADDRESS_488437] 4 weeks after dosing for dose 
escalation to Cohort 3 . Enrollment in Cohort s 2 and3 will only co mmence once enrollment into 
the preceding cohort has completed.  Safety, PK,and PD will be assessed at regular intervals for 
approximately  72 weeks (in Cohorts 1 and 2 )or 24 weeks (in Cohort 3)after starting the dosing 
withstudy drug(Attachment 1) .
7.1.4.Part B:  24-WeekQ2W Multiple D ose Cohorts 
(Cohorts 4through 5)
Safety, PK,and PDwill be assess edin Cohorts [ADDRESS_488438] been administered Q2W for 24 weeks .  The planned doses are 
10and 20mg/kgIV with 12 patients(9LY3002813 ; 3 placebo)planned to be enrolled in each 
cohort. Cohort 4 ( 10 mg/kg IV Q2W for 24 weeks)will be initiated after review o f the safety (at 
least 1 week after dosing) and PK data (complete Day 29 visit) from at least 4 patients receiving 
LY3002813 and 1 receiving placebo in Cohort 1.   Cohort 5 ( 20 mg/kg IV Q2W for 24 weeks)
will only be i nitiated after review of the safety and PK data (at least 4 weeks after dosing) fro m 
Cohort [ADDRESS_488439] been dosed safely  with LY3002813 at l east3timeseach
in Cohort 4.  Safety and PD will be assessed at regular intervals for approximately 48weeksafter 
completion of 24weeks ofdosing wi th LY3002813 (Attachment 1) .

LY30028137.1.5.Part C:  Chronic , 72-WeekQ4W Multiple Dose Cohorts 
(Cohorts 6and 7)
Safety, PK,and PDwill be assess edin Cohorts [ADDRESS_488440] been administered Q4W for up to 72 weeks, or when the 
LY3002813 -induced reduction in amylo id measured by  [CONTACT_389762](defined as SUVr <1.1 for 2 consecut ive scans) (Joshi et al . 2015).  The planned doses 
are 10 and 20 mg/kg IV with 12 patients(9 LY3002813 ; 3 placebo)planned to be enrolled in
each cohort.  Cohort 6 ( 10 mg/kg IV Q4W) and Cohort 7 (20mg/kg IV Q4W) may proceed, in 
parallel wit h Cohorts [ADDRESS_488441] 2 doses each of LY3002813 safely in 
Cohort 6.   The maximum dose of 20 m g/kg will not be exceeded. If apatientisdeemed to be 
amyloid negative by [CONTACT_389763] 18 months’dosing(SUVr <1.1 for 
2consecutive scans), the patient will receive placebo infusio n for all subsequent visits and 
continue the Part C visit schedule, including assessment of sustained amylo id reduction at the 
scheduled PET scan assessments. Safety, PK,and PD will be assessed for all patients at regular 
intervals for approximately 12 weeksafter completion of 72 weeks of dosing wi th LY3002813
(Attachment 1).
7.1.6. CSF S ampling for all Cohorts
CSF samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_389764].  In Cohorts 1through 3, the first CSF sample will be 
collected at baseline and a second co llected approximately [ADDRESS_488442] -
treatment samples(Attachment 1 ).
7.1.7.Study Design for Japanese Patients
Sites in Japan will participate in this study  to recruit Japanese patients.
At least 2Japanese patients should be enrolled in each dose cohort forCohorts 1, 2, 4, and 6.  
Assuming that the cohorts will be dosed based on safet y reviews, i t is intended that at least 
3Japanese patients will be enrolled in each dose cohort for Cohorts 3, 5,and 7; however, 
recruitment to a cohort will not be contingent upon fulfilling these requirements .  At least 
17Japanese patients should be enro lled in the study when all cohorts are dosed .  Japanese patient 
enrollment into cohorts shouldensure sufficien t exposures at applicable doses to support future 
studies(for example, at least 6Japanese patients overall expose dto LY3002813, and at least 
2Japanese pat ientsper cohort exposed to LY [ADDRESS_488443] dose sto be used in future 
studies).  For the purpose of safety evaluation in Japanese patients during the study , Japanese 
patientsat sites in Japan and up to third-generation Japanese patients at sites outside of Japan
will beincluded.  The definit ion of up-to-third-generation Japanese is de fined in Sect ion8.1.
Evaluation of safety data from  patients beforedose escalation in Japan must include at least 
1Japanese pat ient on LY3002813.  Therefore, if no Japanese pat ients are assigned to

haveadequate 1-week or 4-week safety evaluation s(as applicable) , then patients in Japan may

7.2.Discussion of Design and Control
The study will enroll patients with MCI due to AD, mild AD, or moderate AD with amylo id 
deposition confirmed by [CONTACT_389765] 
(Albert et al. 2011;McKhann et al. 2011).  The broad study  population is justified for this study 
because amylo id pathology  is well established before the diagnosis of MCI due to AD and does 
not differentiate during the later stages of disease.  Thus, patients within this spectrum are 
essentially uniform for the purpose of testing LY3002813 effect s on target engagement (Jack 
etal. 2010).  Safety, PK, and PD were assessed in this s tudy population in Study AACC for 
doses of up to 10mg/kg.  Japanese patients are included in this study to help enable the inclusion 
of Japanese patients in potential subsequent phases of development.
The single -dose arms in Part A are intended to be usedto assess whether target engagement can 
be achieved after a single dose of10 mg/kg LY3002813 or greater, given that there was evidence 
of a robust PD signal after only  3doses of 10 mg/kg LY3002813 .  The multiple-dose arms will 
be used to assess a dose response and a time course of amylo id reduction based on florbetapir 
scans at baseline and at 12-to 24-weekintervals.  Twenty-four weeksof dosingin Part B is 
proposed to approximate the maximum durat ion of dosing leading to amylo id reduction in 
StudyAACC; amylo id scans at 12 weeks and 24 weeks will be used to assess the time course of 
amyloid removal and i dentify whethershorter treatment duration ( 12 weeks) is sufficient.  
Sustainabilit y of amyloid reduction after complet ion of 24 weeks of dosing will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_389766] 36, 48, and 72 weeks.  The higher dose and m ore frequent dosing (Q2W) may 
reduce the incidence of immunogenicit y identified in Study  AACC.  If a 12-or 24-weekdosing 
duration is sufficient for amylo id removal, then the ri sks of immunogenicit y and infusio n 
reactions will potentially be limited to that treatment period.  Chronic high -dose treatm ent (Q4W
for up to 72 weeks)in Part C will assess the time course of the maximal PD effect and the 
opportunit y to treat until maximum amylo id removal.
Multiple doses of 10 m g/kg IV were safe and tolerated in Study  AACC.  Although infusio n 
reactions were observed in 6 out of 51 patients dosed with LY3002813, there were no infusio n 
reactions in the 10 mg/kg dose cohort , despi[INVESTIGATOR_389739] .  Clinical dosing of single 
dose of 20 mg/kg or mult iple dosing of 10mg/kg in Study AACD will only be init iated after 
safety review of the single 10-mg/kg dose of LY3002813 .
MRI safet y monitoring will occur [ADDRESS_488445] dose, with acquisition of sequences appropriate for 
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protoco l Page 27
LY3002813detecting vasogenic edema and microhemorrhage .These MRIs and MRIs at addit ional time 
points (ie, at 24 weeks, 48 weeks, and 72 weeks) will also provide vo lumetricand other imaging 
biomarkerassessments. Microhemorrhages are believed to indicate a higher risk for 
macrohemorrhage as well as forthe presence of significant amylo id angiopathy , and there 
appears to be a risk of microhemorrhage with ant iamyloid treatment in preclinical models and in 
humans (eg ,bapi[INVESTIGATOR_34870] , gantenerumab, aducanumab [Black et al. 2010 ]) as well.  Although 
there was no evidence of ARIA -E by [CONTACT_389767] 10 mg/kg LY3002813 in Study  AACC, this 
study will continue to monitor ARIA -E (and ARIA -H).  Thescreening MRI scan will be used to 
exclude pat ients with >4microhemorrhages.  The 12 -week interval between MRI scans is 
considered appropriate given the lack of ARIA -E observed up to 10 mg/kg LY3002813 in
StudyAACC.

8.1.Criteria for Enrollment
Eligibility of patients for study  enrollment will be based on the results of a screening medical 
history, physical  andcognitive examination, clinical imaging tests, and the research disease 
diagnostic criteria (Attachment1).  The nature of any condit ions present at the time of the 
physical examinat ion and any  preexisting condit ions will be documented at screening.
Screening tests may occur up to 56daysbeforestudy drug administration except for the 
following:
Exceptions to the 56-day screening window:  the maximum interval of time allowed from 
performance of screening tests to dosing is presented below.  If the interval is greater than what 
is allowed, then that test may be repeated to meet enro llment criteria beforedosing.  Note that 
stable medical therapy  for 2monthsis a requirement beforedosing regardless of the time elapsed 
for screening criteria.

8.2.1.Discontinuation of Patients
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patients Inadvertently Enrolled
The criteria for enrollment m ust be followed explici tly.  If the invest igator site ident ifies a patient 
who did not meet enrollme nt criteria and who was inadvertent ly enrolled, the sponsor must be 
notified.  If the sponsor ident ifies a pat ient who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was 
inadvertent ly enrolled, the invest igator site will be notified.  A discussio n must occur bet ween 
the Lilly clinical pharmacol ogist or clinical research physician (CRP) and the investigator to 
determine whether the patient may cont inue in the study, with or without investigational product.  
Inadvertent ly enrolled patientsmay be maintained in the study and on invest igational product 
when the invest igator and Lilly clinical pharmaco logist or CRPagree it is medically appropriate 
for that patient.  The patientmay not continue in the study  with or without invest igational
product if the Lilly clinical pharmaco logist or CRPdoes not agree with the invest igator’s 
determinat ion it is medically appropriate for the patient to continue.  The invest igator must 
obtain docum ented approval fro m Lilly clinical pharm acologist or CRPto allow the

receive a single IV administration o f approximately  240MBq (6.5mCi) of 18F-AV-1451.  At 
approximately  75 minutes fo llowing injecti on, a cont inuous 30minute brain scan ( 6 acquisitions, 
each of 5 minute s induration) will be perform ed.
Previously  conducted 18F-AV-1451PET scans can be used as baseline measurements, if the 
sponsor approv es. During these prev ious scans, pati ents might receive a single IV administration 
of approximately  240MBq (6.5 mCi) or 370MBq (10.0 mCi) of 18F-AV-1451.  For each 
patient, the baseline data originally collected for previous Lilly and Avid Radiopharmaceuticals

participate in this study .
18F-AV-1451is an invest igational tracer and was posit ive in the in vitro human ether -a-go-go-
related gene (hERG) assay.  However, the cardiovascular assessments performed during the dog 
toxicology studies showed no evidence that 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_488461] ory of risk factors for torsades de pointes and subjects who intend 
to usedrugs known to significantly prolong the QT interval within 14 days or 5 half -lives, 
whichever i s longer,of a scheduled 18F-AV-1451 PET scan are excluded from studies with this 
tracer.
9.2.4.Radiation Doses Associated with PET Imaging
The estimated exposure to ionizing radiation per patient enrolled in this study  (effective dose) is 
summarized in TableAACD.2.  This includes contributi ons from florbetapir and 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_488462] to the baseline (screening) and endpo int (or early 
discontinuat ion) scanning visits only , if the image is not interpretable because of technical 
artifact (scanner failure, patient motion), the patientmay be asked to schedule an addit ional scan 
and have a second scan performed.  Each patient will only undergo up to1additional PET scan 
beyond those scheduled in this protocol. In this case, the patientwould be exposed to an 
additional 3.92 mSv of ionizing radiation.
In apreviously conducted and accepted 18F -AV-1451 scan, the patient might havebeen
administered with 370 MBq (10.0 mCi) rather than 240 MBq (6.5 mCi) of 18F-AV-1451. In this 
case, the patientwould be exposed to an addit ional 2.9mSv of ionizing radiat ion.

LY30028139.3.Rationale for Selection of Dose
Three to5IV doses of 10 mg/kg LY3002813 administered over 24 weeks or lesswere tolerated 
without any drug-related SAEs or infusio n reactions reporte d in Study  AACCand demonstrated 
target engagement (reduction of florbetapir PET) after 3 to 5 m onths of treatm ent.  Therefore ,
doses of 10 mg/kg will be administered to assess the reproducibilit y and extent the 
amyloid-lowering findings with 10 mg/kg IV dosing in Study  AACC.  Doses greater than 
10mg/kg will be administered to explore the maximal effect of LY3002813 on reducing cerebral 
amyloid.  The single -dose arms in PartAare intended to be used to assess whether target 
engagement can be achieved aft er a single dose.  The mult iple-dose arms will be used to assess a 
dose response and a time course of amylo id reductio n based on florbetapir scans at baseline and 
12-to 24-weekintervals.  Twenty-fourweeksof dosing is proposed in PartBto approximate t he 
maximum durat ion of dosing leading to amylo id reduction in Study AACC; amylo id scans at 
12weeksand 24 weeks will be used to assess the time course of amylo id removal and ident ify 
whethershorter treatm ent durati on (12weeks) is sufficient.  Sustainabi lity of amyloid reduction 
after completion of 24weeksof dosing will be assessed by  [CONTACT_389766] 36, 48, and 
72weeks.  The higher dose and more frequent dosing (Q2W) may  reduce the incidence of 
immunogenicit y identified in Study AACC.  If a 12-or 24-weekdosing duration is sufficient for 
amyloid removal, then the ri sks of immunogenicit y and infusio n reactions will potentially be 
limited to that treatment period.  Chronic high -dose treatment ( Q4Wfor up to 72weeks) in 
PartCwill be used to assess the time course of the maximal PD effect and the opportunit y to 
treat until maximum amylo id removal.
Multiple doses of 10 m g/kg IV were safe and tolerated in Study  AACC.  Clinical dose sof 
20mg/kg and 40 mg/kg are 5-and 2.5-fold lower than the highest do se tested in mo nkeys 
(100mg/kg/week) ,which was a no-observed-effect level .  The abilit y to project human 
exposures at doses above 10 mg/kg is questionable, as the expos ureat 10 mg/kg did not appear 
to be proportional wit h the exposures seen at lower dos es.  The clearance of LY3002813 
appeared to be decreasing, and the half- life increasing, at the 10 mg/kg dose level relat ive to 
what was observed at lower doses .  It is unclear whether this trend will cont inue at higher doses .  
Accordingly , in estimat ing the exposures that may be encountered at doses greater than 10 mg/kg, 
the clearance predicted based on nonclinical data (11.3 mL/h) was used, which is much more 
conservative than the clearance observed to date clinically (26.3 mL/h at the 10 mg/kg dose 
level).  These exposure project ions suggest that a dose of 40 mg/kg may result in exposure that 
exceeds that which was achieved at the no-observed-effect level in the 6-week monkey study
(TableAACD.3).  However, the monkey is an “off-target”species(does not possess deposited 
N3pG Aβ); further, theanimal data d idnot predict thehuman findingswith respect to PK or 
immunogenicit y.

9.4.Dose Escalation
By [CONTACT_105338] a dose -escalation study, data will be evaluated on an ongoing basis unt il the 
maximum toler ated dose i s determined or until the maximum  dose for each dosing frequency  has 
been shown to be well tolerated. If the minimal int olerable dose i s reached for any  dose/dosing 
frequency , then the dose level that is tol erated below this minimal into lerabledoseat each dosing 
frequency  will be designated as the maximum tol erated dose for that dosing frequency .

of [ADDRESS_488464] been dosed.  Additional 
safety reviews may  be added.  If available at the time of dose escalat ion decision,
immunogenicit y and additional PK data may be used as supporting data for dose escalat ion.  No 
dose escalat ion can occur without prior discussio n and agreement between the investigator and 
thestudy team.
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 43
LY30028139.4.1.Dose Escalation Method
Safety data (in particular AEs, SAEs, ECGs, vi tal signs, neurol ogical examinat ions, and adverse 
laboratory  abnormalities)will be independently assessed by [CONTACT_389776].  The assessment of AE relatedness is detailed in Sect ion 10.6.1.
After review of these data, an agreement on initiation of subsequent cohorts as detailed above 
will be made by  [CONTACT_86206].  Additional criteria for init iation of Cohort 5 
are
described in Section9.4above.  Criteria for terminati on of dosing for ei ther dose escalat ion or 
within a dose cohort are in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
9.5.Specific Restrictions/Requirements
Throughout the study , patients may  undergo m edical assessments and review of compliance with 
restrictions before continuing in the study .
Alcohol
Patients will not be permitted to consume alcoho l from 48 hours beforevisitsuntil after leaving 
the site.  Patients will not exceed their habitual alcohol consumpt ion during the study .
Exercise
Patients should avoid strenuous exercise and/or activit y from [ADDRESS_488465] 1 effective method of contraception will be used (for example, condoms 
with spermicide, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device , male sterilizat ion, etc).  The patient 
may choose to use a barrier method of contraception .  (Barrier protection methods without 
concomitant use of a spermicide are not an effect ive or acceptable method .  Thus, each barrier 
method must include use o f a spermicide [ie, condom with spe rmicide, di aphragm with 
spermicide, female condo m with spermicide ].  It shoul d be noted, however, that the use of male 
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 44
LY3002813and female condoms as a double barrier method is not considered acceptable because of the high 
failure rate when these barrier methods ar e combined. )
9.5.1.Special Treatment Considerations
[IP_ADDRESS]. Premedication for Infusions
Premedication for dosingis not planned.  However, if an infusio nreaction occurs, appropriate 
medication maybe used as determined by [CONTACT_30967] (see Section 9.7) .  The patient 
may be premedicated for subsequent infusio ns.  If infusio n reactions are observed, but review of 
thedata suggests that dosingmay continue, administration of acetaminophen (500 to 1000 mg)
and/or an antihistamine, and/or methylpredniso lone(or other corticosteroid) may be 
administered orally 30 to 60 minutes beforestartingtheinfusion for subsequent patients.
The decisio n to implement premedicat ion for infusions in subsequent cohorts will be made by 
[CONTACT_86206] ,and it will berecorded in the study  documentati on, along with the 
dose-escalation decision.
Any premedication given will be documented as a concomitant therapy  (see Sect ion 9.7) .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Management of Infusion Reactions
There is arisk of an infusio n reaction wit h any biological agent; therefore, all patientsshould be 
monitored closely.  Symptom s and signs that may  occur as part of an infusio n reaction include, 
but are not limited to, fever, chills, nausea, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, angioedema, 
throat irritation, rash, pruritus, myalgia, and dizziness.  In the event that a significant infusio n 
reaction occurs, the fo llowing guidance shoul d be followed:
the investigational product infusion should be slowed or stopped, depending on the 
symptoms/signs present
oif slowed, the infusion should be completed at the sl ower rate, as tol eratedand 
documented in the CRF
oif stopped, no further attempts to administer the investigational product will be 
made,and this will be documented in the CRF
supportive care should be emplo yed inaccordance wi th the symptoms/signs.  
Management of the infusio n reaction should proceed according to the severit y of the 
reaction as per the flowchart in Attachment 5.  This may include, but is not limited to,
rescue medications such as diphenhydramine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and/or methylpredniso lone.
Stored serum samples for possible immune safet y laboratory  testing (including but not limited to 
Beta tryptase, total immunogl obulin E,and immune complex testing) will  be collected at time
points indicated in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1) .  
Additional, unscheduled stored serum samples for possible immune safet y laboratory  testing 
(including but not limited to β tryptase, total immunoglobulin E,and immune co mplex testing) 
should also be collected approximately 60 -120 minutes and 4-6 weeks after moderate or severe 
infusion reactions .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Recognition and Management of C erebral Vasogenic Edema
Antiamyloid therapi[INVESTIGATOR_389747]3002813 have been associated with 
cerebral vasogenic edema (ARIA-E)with and without microhemorrhage (ARIA-H). Most of 
these cases are asymptomat ic and havebeen detected by  [CONTACT_389777]. When symptoms
arepresent in associat ion with theseimaging abnormalit ies, they have been reported to include 
headache, gait instabilit y, dizziness, trem or, worsening cognit ive function, alteration of 
consciousness, seizures, unsteadiness, and /orvomiting. In most cases (even when symptom atic), 
theseimaging abnormalit ieshavenot required treatment other than discontinuati on of the 
investigat ional compound, andimaging abnormalities have reso lved.  Infrequent ly, high-dose 
steroid therapy has been administered in the p resence o f prominent symptoms.
If the symptoms above are reported and vasogenic edema is suspected, then the abnormalit y is 
best detected by  [CONTACT_389778] 
T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequence on MRI.  An unsch eduled MRI wi th these sequences 
should be obtained upon suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389748].  It is recommended that MRIbe 
repeatedwith these sequences every 2 to 4 weeks unt il resolution of vasogenic edema is 
documented.  For asymptomat ic or mild symp toms, the pati ent can be observed; for moderate 
symptoms, the use of oral or IV steroids can be considered.  In the case of severe symptoms, it is 
recommended that the pati ent be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389749];the use of IV steroids ,such 
as high-dosedexamethasone or a similar agent , should be considered .  Such medicat ions, if used,
should be entered into the concomitant medicat ions CRF.  If asymptom atic or symptomat ic 
vasogenic edema occurs ,the patient must not receive further dosing and should unde rgo 
discontinuat ion procedures.
Patientswho present with new clinically asymptomat ic microhemorrhages should have a repeat 
MRI approximately  every 4weeksuntil stabilizat ion.
9.6.Blinding
This is a patient-and invest igator-blindstudy.
To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly  personnel  will see the 
randomization table and treatment assignments before the study  is complete.  Refer to 
Attachment 4for details on the blinding/unblinding plan.
Emergency  codes will be available to the pharmacy.  A code, which reveals the treatment group 
for a specific study  patient, may be opened during the study  only if the patient’s well-being 
requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment.
If a patient’s study treatment assignment is unblinded, the patient must be discont inued from the 
study, unless the invest igator obtains specific approval fro m a Lilly clinical pharmaco logist or 
CRPfor the study  participant to continue in the study .  During the study , emergency unblinding 
should occur only by  [CONTACT_389779]’s emergency code.
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page [ADDRESS_488466] igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblind ing 
of a patient’s treatment assignment is warranted. Patient safet y must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determinat ion.If the invest igator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, the investigator should make every effo rt to contact[CONTACT_389780] a study  patient’streatmentassignment .  If a study patient’streatment
assignment is unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately.
Upon com pletion ofthe study,all codes mustbe returnedto Lilly or its designee.
9.7.Concomitant Therapy
Stable medical  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_389750] n/exclusioncriteria are allowed;
however, additional drugs are to be avoided during the study  unless requi red to treat anAE or for 
the treatment of an ongo ing medical problem.   The use of l ocal anesthetics for perform ance of 
LP does not constitute a vio lation of 2 months of stable medical therapy .
For all cohorts, if an infusio n reaction occurs, rescue medications including ,but not limited to, 
diphenhydramine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and/or methylpredniso lone may beadministered at the discretion 
of the invest igator.  Administration of medicat ions beforean infusion to prevent a reaction does 
not cause a discont inuation of the patient from the study.  If the need for concomitant medicat ion 
arises, inclusio n or continuat ion of the patient may be at the discretion o f the investigator after 
consultation wit h a Lilly CRPor clinical pharmacologist.  A llmedication used during the course 
ofthe study must be docum ented.
Concomitant therapy  administered to treat an infusio n reaction or as premedicat ion for infusions 
should be docum ented.

Attachment 2lists the clinical laboratory tests that will be performed for this study.
Attachment 3summarizes the blo od volumes for all blood samplingduring the study.
10.1.Laboratory Samples
Blood, urine, and CSF samples will be co llected to determine whether patients meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and to m onitorpatient healt h.  Routine clinical laboratory  tests will 
be analyzed by  a central laboratory  selected by  [CONTACT_389781]  (screening, coagulat ion 
and CSF protein, glucose ,and cell counts) .
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory  safety report.
Laboratory /analyte results that coul d unblind the study  will not be reported to invest igative sites 
or other blinded personnel until the study  has been unblinded.
Samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed wit hin [ADDRESS_488468] results.  Tests are run and confirmed prompt ly whenever scient ifically 
appropriate.  When scientific circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain samples 
to batch the tests run, or to retain the samples until the end of the study  to confirm  that the resul ts 
are valid.  Certain samples may be retained for a longe r period, if necessary , to comply with 
applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory  certificati on standards.
10.2.Samples for Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic 
Evaluations
10.2.1.Pharmacokinetic Samples
At the visits and times specified in the Study Schedule, 1 venous blood sample of approximately 
4mL will be collected for each PK assessment (Attachment 1) .  These blo od samples will be 
used to determine the serum concentrati ons of LY3002813.  The actual date and time (24 -hour 
clock time) of each sampling will be recorded.   On the day of dosing, every attempt should be 
made to collect samples at the specified time; however, failure to do so will not constitute a
protocol violation.
A maximum of [ADDRESS_488469] igator and sponsor.  Instructions for 
the collection and handling of blood samples will be provi ded by [CONTACT_456] .
On the dosing day , PK serum  samples will  be collected from  the arm that did not receive the 
infusion of study  drug.
Time points for PK may be modified based on interim PK results.
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 48
LY300281310.2.2.Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_389751], a lumbar x- ray or fluoroscopy  may be conducted at screening to 
perform the procedure or rule out potential contraindicat ion to a LP, such as significant 
osteoarthritic disease and bone overgrowth.   If an x-rayor fluoroscopy  wasdone within 12 
months of screening, this may be used.
A qualified physician ( eg,anesthesio logist or neurol ogist) will perform  the LP under l ocal 
anesthesia.  At each LP, a maximum of 15 mL (including up to 5 mL for local laboratory testing) 
of CSF will b e collected.  The first 5mL of CSF will be co llected and sent to a local laboratory  
for testing of white blood cell count, red blood cell count (where possible), total protein, and 
glucose.  In addition, eachCSF sample will be visually inspected for evid ence of blood 
contaminat ion.  The results of the visual inspect ion and local laboratory  CSF analyses are to be 
documented on the electronic CRF (eCRF).  Grossly evident blood by [CONTACT_389782] .  Theremaining CSF will be co llected to 
measure conc entrations of Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, total tau,and phospho -tau measurements, as well as 
LY3002813 (see below) in patients who are randomly  assigned to receive LY3002813.  All other 
remaining CSF will be stored for exploratory  work (Secti on10.2).
Patients will be carefully mo nitored for post -LP headaches.  The invest igator may use hydrat ion, 
analgesics, and blood patch to treat the headache ,as clinically  indicated.
Any sample that shows visual or laboratory  evidence of blood con tamination may be excluded 
from the PK and stati stical analyses if the level of contaminat ion is estimated to be sufficient to 
produce misleading results.
10.2.3.Bioanalysis
Samples will be analyzed at a l aboratory  approved by  [CONTACT_17077] a facilit y 
designated by  [CONTACT_456] .
Serum and CSF concentrations of LY3002813 will be determined using a validated enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay method.  It is not intended that s amples collected fro m placebo-
treated pati ents will be analyzed .  Samples will be analyzed at a laboratory  approved by  [CONTACT_389783].
Bioanalytical samples collected to m easure invest igational product concentrations will be 
retained for a maximum o f 2yearsfollowing last patientvisit for the study .  During this time, 
samplesremaining after the bioanalyses may be used for exploratory  analyses such as 
metabolism and/or protein binding work.
10.2.4.Plasma Samples
Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA) plasma from a 6 mL collection tube willbe analyzed 
for Aβ species, which includes A β1-40 and Aβ1-42.  Other fragments of amyloid precursor protein
processing or A βplaque species may be analyzed.
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page [ADDRESS_488470] a pati ent’s response to therapy .  
Variable response to therapy  may be due to ge netic determinants that impact drug absorption, 
distribution, metabo lism, and excretion, the mechanism of act ion of the drug, the disease 
etiology and/or the m olecular subt ype of the disease being treated.  Therefore, where local 
regulations and ERBs allo w, a 1-time blood sam ple will be collected for pharmacogenet ic 
analysis(Attachment 1 ).
Collection of samples for other biomarker research is also part of this study .  Bloodand CSF
samples will be co llectedas specified in the Study  Schedule.
The CSF, plasma , and serum stored samples may be used f or research to develop methods, 
assays, prognostics ,and/or com panion diagnostics rel ated to AD and or other neuropathol ogical 
conditions.
Bloodsamples for bio marker research are required and will be collected from all patientsin this 
studyas specified in the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 ).
Samples will be tested for the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genoty pe (ε2, ε3, ε4) and translocase of 
outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOMM40) poly -T polymorphism to determine whetherthese 
genetic variants are associated with response to LY3002813.  APOE genoty pe, which is in 
linkage disequilibrium wit h TOMM40, has been demonstrated even in small sample sizes to be 
associated with vasogenic edema co mplications; thus, the analysis o f these genes i s planned.  In 
addition, where l ocal regulations allow, the sample will be stored and analysis may be performed 
on other genet ic variants thought to play a role in response to LY3002813, response to 
antidementia concomitant therapy , and/or m olecular subt ypes of AD to test their associat ion with 
observed clinical outcomes when taking the study  drug.  While it is unlikely  that signals from 
small trials can be suggested by  [CONTACT_389784], samples may be saved for analysis part icularly 
for retrospective revie w if future studi es detect associ ations or other researchers report 
significant findings.  At the current time, possible target genes include, but are not limited to, 
FcγRII, FCγRIII, CLU, CR1, PI[INVESTIGATOR_389752], MAPT, BIN1, PSEN1, and PSEN2.
CSFsamples rem ainingafter local laboratorystudies, LY3002813 PK, amyloid species ,and tau 
species testing arecomplete may be retained as stored samples for a maximum of [ADDRESS_488471] but may include VILIP -1, YKL40, β -amyloid fragments, 
interleukins, tum or necrosis factor alpha, and inflammatory  cytokines.
EDTA plasma from a 6-mL collection tube and serum from a 6-mL collection tube will each be 
aliquoted into 5 respective 0.5- mL aliquot volumes for a total of 10 aliquots (5 EDTA plasma 
and 5 serum).  These samples will be stored for biomarker research and development.  The 
following list of potential exploratory  biomarkers does not preclude future m olecules of interest

alpha, and inflammatory  cytokines.
ABI Tempus TMtubes (3 mL blood) for ribonucleic acid extraction and expl oratory gene 
expressio n will be collect ed/processed and stored for future analysis.
In the event of an unexpected AE or the observat ion of unusual response, the pharmacogenetic 
samples may  be genotyped and analysis may  be perform ed to eval uate a genet ic associat ion with 
response to LY3002813 .  These invest igations may be limited to a focused candidate gene study  
or, if appropriate, genome wide analysis may be perform ed to identify regions of the geno me 
associated with the variabili ty observed in drug response.  The pharmacogenet ic samples will 
only be used for investigat ions related to disease and drug or class of drugs under study  in the 
context of this clinical program.  They  will not be used for broad exploratory  unspecified disease 
or population genetic analysis.
Other samples may  be used for research to develop methods, assays, prognosti csand/or 
companion diagnosti csrelated todisease process, pathways associated with disease state, and/or
mechanism o f action of the investigational product (s).
The samples will be coded with the patientnumber and stored for up to a maximum of 15years 
after the last patient visit for the study at a facilit y selected by  [CONTACT_456].  The samples and any 
data generated from them can only be linked back to the patientby [CONTACT_389785].  
The durati on allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory  requests related to the investigational 
product.
An 11-mL blood sample for pharmacogen eticevaluation is a requi red part of this study , unless 
country-specific laws and regul ations prohibit this ty pe of testing.  A 3- mL tube will be used for 
APOE genoty pes and TOMM40 polymorphisms, a 4- mL tube will be used for DNA extraction, 
and a 4-mL tube of who le blood will be stored.  These sampleswill be used to test for genetic 
variants that may influence response t o treatment.
Samples will be destroyed according to a process consistent with local regulation.
10.4.Samples for Immunogenicity Research
Blood samples for immunogen icity testing will  be collected to determine ant ibody production 
against the investigational product.  Additional samples may be collected if there is a possibilit y 
that anAE isimmunologically mediated.  Immunogenicit y will be assessed by a validated assay  
designed to detect ADAsin the presence o f the investigational product .  Antibodies may be
further characterized and/or evaluated for their abilit y to neutralize the activit y of the 
investigat ional product .
Samples may be stored for a m aximum of [ADDRESS_488472] .

then additionalsafety assessments (concomitant medicat ions, AEs, l aboratory  values, vital signs, 
ECGs) and samples for immunogenicit yand PKshould be taken every 12weeksuntil the titer 
returns to baseline (co mes within a single 2- fold dilution of the baseline t iter) or up to [ADDRESS_488474] dose .In the case of a patient whose result is positive at baseline wit h a 
1:10 titer and then subsequent ly develops a treatment -emergent ADA response that increases to 
much higher titers, the antibody  titer would need to decline to a titer of 1:20 or less to b e 
considered a “return to baseline .”In contrast, if the patient ’s resultis “not detected” at baseline 
(in an assay with a 1:10 minimal required dilution), the titer would need to decline to either 
“detected” with a 1:10 titer or a result of “not detecte d” to be considered a “return to baseline .”
10.5.Exploratory Evaluations
10.5.1.Cognitive and Functional Scales
The test of cognit ive function, ADAS-cog, NTB, MMSE,Clinical Dement ia Rating-Sum of 
Boxes (CDR -SB), Alzheimer ’s Disease Cooperative Study -Mild Cognit ive Impairment-
Activities ofDaily Living (ADCS-MCI-ADL)scale,and FCSRT -IRwill beperformed during 
the study at the times specified in the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 ).  These tests are performed 
as a safety and exploratory measure to document any substant ial change associated with 
treatment, as it is not anticipated that these tests should have significan
t changes associated with 
LY3002813 in this small pat ient population and short time window.  Cognitive and funct ional 
tests that are performed on the same day  should be done in a specific order.  Screening tests 
should be completed in this order:  1) MMSE,2) FCSRT -IR, and 3) CDR.  The other scales, if 
done on the same day, should be performed in this order:  1) NTB, 2) ADCS -MCI-ADL, and 
3)ADAS-cog.  The study  partner (or 1of the study  partners if there are 2) should be present or 
available by  [CONTACT_756] f or the assessment of CDR and ADCS -MCI-ADL (this should be the 
primary study partner for ADCS- MCI-ADL).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale -Cognitive Subscale
The ADAS was designed as a rating scale for the severit y of the dysfunction in the cognit ive and 
noncognit ive behavior characterist ic of persons with AD (Rosen et al. 1984).  The cognit ive 
subscale o f the ADAS (ADAS -cog[11]) consists of [ADDRESS_488475] 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_272725]:  ori entation, verbal memory , language, and praxi s.  The scale ranges 
from 0 to 70, wi th higher scores indicating greater disease severit y.  An extended ADAS -cog 
(the ADAS -cog[14]) which includes measurements of delayed free recall, digit cancellat ion, and 
maze completion will be used in this study  (Mohset al. 1997).  A conversio n code of 0 to10 for 
delayed free recall and 0 to 5 for both digit cancellation and maze complet ion provide a total 
ADAS-cog[14] score that ranges from 0 to 90.
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page [ADDRESS_488476] ions.  The NTB 
shows linear annual cognit ive changes across a wide range of MMSE scores as compared to the 
ADAS-cog and is more sensitive than the ADAS -cog among patients with mild impairment 
(Harrison 2007).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Mini-Mental Scale Examination
The MMSE is one of the most widely used screening instruments for cognit ive impairment and 
provides a total  score ranging from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicat ive of greater cognit ive 
impairment (Folstein et al. 1975).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Dementia Rating
The CDR is a clinical staging instrument for Dement ia (Morris 1993).  It characterizes [ADDRESS_488477] ional perform ance:  memory, orientation, judgment andproblem solving, 
community affairs, home andhobbies, and personalcare.  The necessary informat ion to make 
each rating is obtained through a semistructured interview of the patient and a reliable informant 
or collateral so urce (eg,a familymember).  The CDR table provides descriptive anchors that 
guide the clinician in making appropriate ratings based on interview data and clinical judgment .  
In addition to ratings on a5-point scale for each domain (except for personal ca re, which is rated 
on a 4-point scale), an overall CDR score i s derived by  [CONTACT_389786].  This score is useful 
for globally staging the l evel ofimpairment :  0 indicates no impairment ;0.5, 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_488478] ively.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Dementia Rating –Sum of Boxes
The CDR -SB is considered a more detailed quant itative general index than the global score and 
has reasonable accuracy to discriminate between patients with very early AD and those with 
MCI.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Scale
The ADCS -MCI-ADL is a 24- item questionnaire that attem pts to detect milder functional 
impairments and represent a modificat ion of the original act ivities of daily living scale ( Galasko 
et al. 1997).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test with Immediate Recall
The FCSRT -IR is a 16- item instrument version of controlled learning (Grober and 
Buschke1987).  FCSRT -IR performance as an indicator of early AD co mes from correlations 
with abnormalities in structural  and functional imaging and with neurofibrillary lesio ns in 
parahippocampal regions that are the earliest targets of AD patho logy.
10.5.2.Imaging
A total of two 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_488479] 24 hours apart from the florbetapir scan (for further details on florbe tapir 
imaging see Section 9).  The change in grey matter SUV rwill be compared to total dose 
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page [ADDRESS_488480]-baseline MRIs will be performed, mostly for safety monitoring(i.e.,occurring4 
weeks after the first dose, every  12weeks starting from the first dose, and up to [ADDRESS_488481] dose ).  However, additional MRI scans are included for exploratory  evaluation of brain 
structural changes(including, but not limited to, whole brain, ventricle, and hippocamp al 
volumes), white matter and tissue microstructure changes, and funct ional connect ivity in brain 
networks at baseline, [ADDRESS_488482] igator’s discretion.
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, 
AEs that are serious , considered related to study  treatment or the study ,or that caused the patient
to discont inue before completing the study.  The patientshould be followed until the event is 
resolved or explained.  Frequency o f follow-up evaluation is left to the discret ion of the 
investigator.
In addition to records of observat ions made at specific t imes, unexpected signs and symptoms 
and conco mitant medications will be recorded in the clinical trial records throughout the study .
Safety monitoring in will include MRIs, AEs, ECGs, vital signs (blood p ressure, pulserate, and 
temperature), physical and neurological examinat ions, C-SSRS, and safet y laboratory  tests 
(includingLP clinical laboratory  tests).
For Part A, MRI safet y monitoring will consist of a baseline MRI ,a Week4postdosing MRI,
and a Week12 postdosing MRI ,with sequences appropriate for detecting vasogenic edema and 
microhemorrhage.  MRIs atbaseline,24weeks, 48weeks, and 72 weeks are for volumetric 
assessment.   Additional MRI measures may be obtained at these ARIA -related and/or MRI time 
points.
For Parts B and C , MRI safet y monitoring will  consist of a baseline MRI, a Week 4 postdosing 
MRI, and a Week12 postdosing MRI, as well as MRIs every  12 weeks unt il 48weeks (Part B) 
and 12weeks (Part C)after the last dose.   MRIs at baseline, 24 weeks, 48weeks, and 72weeks 
are for volumetric assessment.   Additional MRI measures may  be obtained at these ARIA -related 
and/or MRI time points.
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page [ADDRESS_488483] ion9.4and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_389753]8.2.  Safety evaluationsof Cohorts 1 and2 will be performed after a minimum of 
5patients (4patients on LY3002813 and 1 patient on placebo ) have concluded the [ADDRESS_488484] co mpleted 4-week 
safety assessments .
Regular safet y evaluations across all cohorts will be performed at 3-monthlyintervals.  All new 
data as listed above will be included ,in addition to the local CSF lab oratory tests.  Each 
geography (which may  mean separate m eetingsin the [LOCATION_002] and in Japan)will meet as 
described above to determine whether stoppin g rules are m et.
10.6.1.Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory  
requirements that m ay be less stringent.
Study site personnel  will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’spreexisting 
conditions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in 
the study.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal (note:  fertile wom en are excluded fro m the 
study) or paternal  exposures to the investigational productshouldbe reported.  Data on fetal 
outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory  reporting and drug safet y evaluation.
After the IC Fis signed, site personnel will record any change in the condit ion(s) and the 
occurrence and nature of any AEs.  All AEs related to protocol procedures are reported to Lilly 
or designee.
Any clinically  significant findings from ECGs, laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, 
physical or neurological examinat ion, and PET/MRI that result in a diagnosis should be reported 
as an AE to Lilly or its designee.
In addition, all AEs occurring after the patient receives the first dose of the invest igational 
product must be reported to Lilly or its designee via designated data transmission methods.
Investigators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, investigat ional product, and/or drug delivery  
systemvia designated data transmissio n methods.
The invest igator decides whe ther he or she interprets the observed AEs as either related to 
disease, to the study  medication, study procedure, or other concomitant treatment or pathologies.  
To assess the relat ionship of the AE to the investigational product , the following termino logies 
are defined:
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 55
LY3002813related:  a direct cause and effect relat ionship between the study  treatment and 
the AE is likely
possibly related :  a cause and effect relationship between the study  treatment and 
the AE has not been demonstrated at this time and is not probable, but is also not 
impossible
unrelated:  without questi on, the AE i s definitely not associated with the study  
treatment
As per Lilly’s standard operating procedures all “related” and “possibly related” AEs and SAEs 
will be defined as related to the investigational product .
Study site personnel  must alert Lilly or i ts designee within [ADDRESS_488485] igator 
unblinding a patient’s treatment group assignment for any reason.
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to Lilly  or its designee via designated data transmissio n methods 
the circumstances and data leading to any  such dosage reduction or discont inuation of treatment.
10.6.2.Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AE from this study  that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es:
death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent o r significant di sability/incapacit y
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  [CONTACT_240235] m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_160504] s when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they  
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definit ion.
Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlyi ng medical condit ion has 
worsened during the course of the study .
Study site personnel  must alert Lilly or i ts designee of any SAE within [ADDRESS_488486].  If a patient experiences an SAE after signing informed consent, but 
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page [ADDRESS_488487] been caused by  a protocol  procedure.
SAEsoccurringup to and including the patient’s last study visit will be co llected,regardless o f 
the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of causation, in the clinical data collect ion database andthe 
pharmacovigilance system at the sponsor .
The invest igator does not need to actively mo nitor patientsfor AEsonce the trial has ended 
unless specified in the protocol.   However, i f an investigator becomes aware of SAEsoccurring 
to apatient after the patient’s participat ion in the trial has ended , the invest igator should report 
them to the sponsor, regardless of the invest igator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of causat ion,and theSAEswill be 
entered in the pharmacovigilance system at the sponsor.
Information on SAEsexpected in the study  populationindependent of drug exposure and that 
will be assessed by  [CONTACT_92356].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the reference safet y section of the IB and that the invest igator ident ifies as related to 
investigat ional product or procedure.  [LOCATION_002] 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical 
TrialDirective 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or national regul atory 
requirements in participat ing countries require the reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs. Lilly has procedures 
that will be fo llowed for the recording and expedit ed reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent 
with global regulat ions and the associated detailed guidances.
10.6.3.Other Safety Measures
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physical Examination
Physical examinat ions and routine medical assessments will be conducted as specified in the 
Study Schedule and as clinically  indicated (Attachment 1 ).  Other elements of the physical 
examinationmay be included on an optional or symptom -directed basis .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs
Blood pressure and pulseratewillbe measured as specified in the Study  Schedule and as 
clinically indicated (Attachment 1) .
Blood pressure and pulse rate should be m easured after at l east 5minutes sitting.
If the patientfeels unable to stand, supi[INVESTIGATOR_47538].
Unscheduled orthostatic vital signs should be assessed, if possible, during any AE of dizziness or 
posture-induced symptoms.  Addit ional vital signs may be m easured during each study  period if 
warranted and agreed upon between the sponsor and invest igator.
Body temperature (axillaryin Japan)willbe measured as specified in the Study  Schedule and as 
clinically indicated (Attachment 1) .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Body Weight
Body weight will be recorded as specified in the Study Schedule and as clinically indicated 
(Attachment 1).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Electrocardiograms
For each patient, a single12 -lead digital ECG will be co llected according to the Study Schedule 
(Attachment 1).  ECGs must be recorded before collect ing any blood for safet y or PK tests.
Patients mustbe supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044] [ADDRESS_488489] igational site.
ECGswill be interpreted by a qualified physician ( the investigator or qualified designee) at the 
site as soon after the time o f ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the patient is still 
present,to determine whether the patient meets entry  criteria at the relevant visit(s) and for 
immediate patient management, should any clinically relevant findings be ident ified.  
If a clinically significant quantitative or qualitat ive change fro m baselineis identified (including, 
but not limited to ,changes in QT/ corrected QT [QTc]interval from baseline) after enrollment, 
the investigator will determine whetherthe patient can cont inue in the study .  The invest igator or 
qualified designee is responsible for determining whetherany change in pat ient management i s 
needed and must document his/her revi ew of the ECG printed at the time of evaluat ion from at 
least 1of the replicate ECGs fro m each time po int.  Any new clinically relevant finding should
be reported as an AE.
Digital ECGs will be electroni cally transmitted to a central ECG laboratory  designated by [CONTACT_11007].  
The central ECG laboratory  will perform a basic quali ty control check (for example, 
demographics and study  details) then store the ECGs in a database.  At a future time, the stored 
ECG data may be overread at the central ECG laboratory  for further evaluation o f machine-read 
measurements or to meet regulatory  requirements.  
The machine-read ECG intervals and heart rate may  be used for data analysis and report writing 
purposes unless a cardio logist overread of the ECGs is conducted beforecompletion of the final 
study report (in which case the overread data would be used).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Neurological Examinations
A directed neurol ogical examinationwill be performed by  a physician, nurse practit ioner, or 
physician’s assistant (for Japan, physician only) at the time po ints specified in the Study  
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 58
LY3002813Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).  If abnormalit ies are noted at these time po ints, additional 
examinations should be perform ed at daily  intervals unt il the patienthas returned to baseline.  
The examiner should be familiar with the patient’sbaseline exam ination.  Mandated el ements of 
the examination include inspection for tremor, extraocular movements, brachial and patellar deep 
tendon reflexes, finger -nose point ing, and Romberg sign.  
TableAACD.4presents the scoring of the neurological examinationfindings. For patientswith 
mild (1+) tremor or ny stagmus at baseline, increases in these findings should not be scored at a 
higher level unless the examiner judges them to be significantly exacerbated compared to 
baseline.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Cohorts 1 through 7)
By [CONTACT_389787](FDA), any assessment of suicide -related thoughts 
and behaviors must map to the Columbia Classification Algorithm for Suicide Assessment 
(Posneret al. 2007).  The C -SSRS was developed by [CONTACT_389788] h trial 
group to map directly to the Columbia Classificat ion Algorithm for Suicide Assessment and 
therefore was chosen to assess suicide -related thoughts and behaviors in this study .
The C-SSRS is a scale that captures the occurrence, severit y, and frequency  of suicide-related 
thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period.  The scale includes suggested questions to 
solicit the ty pe of inform ation needed to determine whethera suicide-related thought or behavior 
has occurred.  The C-SSRS will be administered as spec ified in the Study Schedule
(Attachment 1) by [CONTACT_140823].
The C-SSRS is available in adult and child versio ns; however, there is no versio n of the C -SSRS 
for a cognitively impaired populat ion.  The adult version contains a more elaborate “Intensit y of 
Ideation” section that requires memory  of past thoughts in a tem poral context, and a cognitively  
impaired populat ion may be unable to give an accurate response.  The child versio n of the C -
SSRS has condensed this sect ion into 1 questi on.  This reason, and also the suggested wordi ng 
for the scale questions having been simplified, resulted in the child versio n being chosen for th is 
study.  
The child version of theC-SSRS shoul d be administered to the patient with the study partner
presentor available by [CONTACT_648] .  Responses fro m both the study partnerand patient should be

[IP_ADDRESS]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRI scans will be obtaine d at time points indicate d in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1) .
MRI safety monitoring will co nsist of MRIs with sequences appropriate for detecting vasogenic 
edema and microhemorrhage (ARIA-E and ARIA -H).  Thenumber of microhemorrhages 
detected on the baseline MRI scan will serve as 1factor in the exclusio n criteria (that is, 
exclusion of patients with >4microhemorrhages ).  Microhemorrhages might indicate a higher 
risk for macrohemorrhage,as well as the presence of significant amylo id angiopathy, and there 
appears to be a risk of microhemorrhage with so me antiamyloid treatments in preclinical models 
and possibly in humans as well.
The determinat ion of the number of microhemorrhages will be required to be assessed on a 
1.5Tor 3T MRI using a T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequence.  Addit ional FLAIR images will 
be perform ed to eval uate for the presence of vasogenic edema.  All baseline and safety  imaging 
will be analyzed by a central reader blinded to treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Special Procedure/Subjective Procedure
The CSF samples acquired via LPwill be collected at time points indicated in the Study  
Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity Samples
Samples for immunogenicit y testing will be collected at time points indicated in the Study 
Schedule (Attachment 1 ).  Serum samples will be used to determine ant ibody production against 
LY3002813.  Immunogenicit y will be assessed by  a validated assay  designed to detect ADAsin 
the presence o f LY3002813.  Ant ibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for their 
ability to neutralize the activ ity of LY3002813.  Samples may  be stored for a m aximum of 
15years following last patient visit to enable further analysis o f immune responses to 
LY3002813.  The duration allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory requests related to the 
study drug.

10.6.5.Complaint Handling
Lilly collects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical trials in order to ensure the safet y of study participants, m onitor quality, and to facilita te 
process and product improvements.
Complaints related to unblinded comparator drugs or concomitant drugs/drug delivery  systems 
are reported directly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package 
insert.
For blinded studies, a ll product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and 
released by [CONTACT_389789].
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the

10.7.Appropriateness and Consistency of Measurements
All of the measurements in thisstudy will beperformed using standard, validated methods .
10.8.Compliance
Every attempt will be made to select patients who have the abilit y to understand and co mply with 
instructions.  Noncom pliant pati ents may be discont inued from the study.  The time and d ay of 
drug administration will be recorded.  Drug accountabilit y records will  be maintained by [CONTACT_112769].
The specificat ions in this protocol for the timings of safet y, PK, andPD sampling are given as 
targets, to be achieved within reasonable limit s.  Modificat ions may be made to the time po ints 
based upon the safet y and PKinformation obtained.  The scheduled time points may be subject 
to minor alterations; however, the actual time must be correctly recorded in the CRF.
Any major m odifications that might affect the conduct of the study , patient safety, and/or data 
integrity will be detailed in a protocol amendment.

to haveapproximately 12patients (9LY3002813 ; 3placebo) complete the study.
The sample size is customary  for studies evaluating safety, PK, and/or PD parameters ;at the 
conclusion of the trial,confidence intervals for PK, PD, and cognition endpo ints may be 
computed in order to evaluate the precisio n of the estimates where appropriate.  Based on prior 
Lilly clinical trials, 6patients randomized to each LY3002813 dose and placebo provide over 
90%power to detect at least a  mean SUVr reduction of adose com pared to that of placebo 
withoutmultiple comparison adjustment.  Based on Fixed and Adapt ive Clinical Trial Simulator
simulations, there is over 90% success rate that at least 1 LY3002813 d ose separates from 
placebo with a success cri terion of Pr(mean SUVr reduction of LY3002813 dose < mean SUVr 
reduction of placebo) > .  If more patients are needed to determine safet y, target engagement, 
PK, dosing, and/or race differences, then up to a total of 10 additional patients may  be added.
Patientswho are randomized but who do not complete the 12- week safet y and PET assessment s

characterist ics will be recorded and may be used in the PK, PD, and safety analyses as 
quantitative or classification variables .  These characteri stics will be listed and summarized at 
baseline, with the except ion of weight ,which will also be summarized over time.
11.2.4.Pharmacokinetic Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimat ion
Noncompartmental analysis will be conducted ,and PK parameter estimates of clearance and 
half-life will be reported forLY3002813 .Compartmental modeling using nonlinear mixed -
effects modelingor other appropriate software may be explored ,andpopulationestimates for 
clearance and central  volume of distribution may be reported .  Depending on the model selected, 
other PK parameters may also be reported .  Exploratory graphical analyses of the effect of dose 
level or demographic factors on PK parameters may be conducted .  Additional modeling may  be 
performed based on the results of the graphical analyses .  Exploratory graphical  analyses rel ating 
LY3002813 serum exposure to LY3002813 CSF concentrations may be conducted.
Additional exploratory analyses of t he data may be conducted if deemed appropriate .
Interim PK analyses may be conducted using noncompartmental analysisand/or com partmental 
modeling.
11.2.5.Pharmacodynamic Analyses
PD and cognit ion endpoints as function of visit or time will be summarized and/or plotted as 
appropriate ;further details will be given in the statist ical analysis plan.  As there will not be 
sufficient information to make informat ive comparisonsto placebowithinthe Japanese 
population,all analyses will be conducted on the overall populat ion unless otherwise specified.  
As the analyses are considered exploratory , changes to the planned analyses will not require a 
protocol amendment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Imaging Analyses
Statistical assessment of the SUVrwill be analyzed by a mixedmodel repeated m easure 
(MMRM).  Theplanned analyses is an MMRM us ingatleast compound symmetry  covariance
structure with fixed effects of treatment doses(LY3002813 and placebo), study  visit,and
interaction between treatment and visit .  A baseline c ovariate adjustment may be used .  The 
primary comparison is between LY3002813 and placebo for change fro m baseline in composite 
SUVr or percent change in composit eSUVrat last PET imaging visit.  This analysis may be 
repeated for SUVrs inindividual brain regions if needed.
I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 64
LY3002813In addition to the MMRM analysis, a Bayesian posterior probabilit y maybe computed for each 
LY3002813 dose compared to placebo.  For each dose, the credible interval will be co mputed for 
each dose relat ive to placebo.
Changes in vo lume(including, but not limited to, who le brain, ventricle, and hippocampus ), 
brain tissue microstructure ,and functional connectivit y in brain networks captured by [CONTACT_389791];exploratory  evaluation of whole brain and anatomically 
localized structural and functional changeswill be summarized .  MRI will be obtained every  12-
24 weeks; therefore ,an MMRM may be conducted fitting treatment and study visit as fixed 
effects.
Additionally, the relationship between LY3002813 serumexposure and imaging endpo ints may 
be explored graphically or by  a modelingapproach.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmaco dynamic Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] F luid Estimation
The CSF results fro m the LPs taken pre -and postdose will be analyzed to estimate t he mean 
change and percent change from predose.  The dependent variables are Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, total 
tau, and phospho -tau.
[IP_ADDRESS].
Cognition and Functional Analyses
ADAS-cog, NTB, MMSE, CDR-SB, ADCS -MCI-ADL,and FCSRT-IRwill all be summarized 
andmay be analyzed using an MMRM wit h preinfusion cognit ive measures as a baseline 
covariate and fixed effects of dose and study visit.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Plasma Aβ
Plasma Aβ will be analyzed to estimate the mean change fro m predose.  The dependent variables 
will be Aβ 1-40andAβ1-42.
Dosing regimen will be a fixed effect in the model and time may be included as a repeated effect.  
These analyses are considered exploratory  in order to estimate whetherthere is mean change 
following doses of LY3002813. If required ,a logarithmic transformat ion may be considered.
11.2.6.Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Exploratory analyses m ay be conducted to describe the relat ionship between serum or CSF 
exposure and changes in the florbeta pir SUVr, as well as relationships wit h cognitive endpo ints, 
ADA,AEs, and/or pl asma and CSF bio markers.  It is intended that these analyses will be 
graphical in nature as a funct ion of LY3002813 dose , exposure, and/or time fro m study entry;
however, the relationship may also be described using a modeling approach, if appropriate.
11.2.7.Safety Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Evaluation of Safety
All investigational product and protocol procedure AEs will be listed ;if the frequency of events 
allows, safet y data will be summarized using descript ive methodology.

I5T-MC-AACD(f)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page [ADDRESS_488496] -related SAEs will be reported .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Evaluation of Safety
Safety parameters that will be assessed include safety  laboratoryparameters, vi tal signs, and 
ECG parameters.  The parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descript ive 
statistics.  Addit ional analysis will be perform ed if warranted upon review of the data.
Ashift table for each dose group will be constructed to assess the MRI measurement pre -and 
postdose for changes and addit ions of vasogenic edema and microhemorrhages .
Suicide-related thoughts and behaviors based on the C-SSRS will be listed by [CONTACT_4164].  Only time
pointsand patients that show ideat ion/behavior of suicide will be displayed (ie,all “no” 
responses will not be displayed ).
Exploratory analyses of Fridericia’s corrected QT interval data from ECG monitoring in a 
Phase1 trial are perform edto judge the extent and/or risk of QT prolongation .  There will be an 
exploratory  assessment of potenti al prolongation by [CONTACT_66567] m ean change in Fridericia’s 
corrected QT intervalas a funct ion of serumdrug concentrati on obtained and an inspect ion of 
the upper confidencelimit relative to a value of 10 msec, which is consistent with Internat ional 
Conference on Harmonisat ion (ICH) guidance.  Frequency  tables of QTc changes from baseline 
and large QTc values may also be obtained in accordance wit h ICH guidance.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Evaluation of Immunogenicity
Antibody formation will be summarized over time.  If trends following the dosing of LY3002813 
are observed ,then a mixed effect model will be done fitt ing dose, study visit,and interaction 
betweenstudy visit and dose as fixed effect sand the dependent variable as the change fro m 
baseline in ant ibody formulation following dosing of LY3002813 .  If a neutralizat ion assay is 
performed, the frequency  of neutralizing antibodies will be determined.  The relationship 
between the presence (or absence) of ADAsand clinical parameters (AEs, PDmeasurements, 
and PK estimates) may be assessed.
11.3.Interim Analyses
The Lilly study team will review data obtained on an ongoing basis, to assure patient safet y.
It is intended that a safet y review of Cohort 2 data will be conducted to enable the enro llment of 
Cohorts 3, 5,and 7.  This review is described in Section 7.1.3.

aPatients may be admitted on Day -1, to perform these tests, at the discretion of the site.  Note that the ADAS -cog and NTB testing must be separated from 
each other by [ADDRESS_488506] 6hours after the end of infusion .  Any patient discharged before the 24-, 48-, and 72-hour procedures will be 
required to return to the site for procedures at the respective time points. 
cScreening tests may occur up to 56days before the study drug administration apart from the exceptions presented in Section 8.1.
dPerformed before dosing.
eA single ECG will be obtained at screening and will not be transmitted to central vendor.  All other ECGs will be done in triplicate and transmitted to the 
central vendor for storage.   For visit with no specified ECG timing (“X”), the ECG should be collected close to the PK collection and should be time matched 
with preadmission ECGs (Visit 4).
fIf the investigator determ ines that suicide -related behaviors have occurred, the Lilly SHSFform will be used to collect additional information to allow for a 
more complete assessment of these behaviors.

prolong QT interval (with sponsor approval) need a minimum of 14 days or 5 half -lives, whichever is longer, without that drug prior to the 18F-AV-1451
scan.
lInpatient stay is required until a minimum of 6 hours after the end of the infusion for observation .  Patients will be assessed according to the Schedule of 
Events prior to being disch arged.  The 6- hour observation period at the site may be extended beyond 6 hours for safety or feasibility reasons (including an 
overnight stay), at the discretion of the investigator.   In Part A, no more than [ADDRESS_488508] dosing day, 
predose (at the time planned for the start of the dose on Day 1 visit), approximately at the end of infusion, and [ADDRESS_488509] 3 days before dosing, because a second CSF sample will be taken approximately 3 days after dosing with stu dy drug.  Local laboratory will 
process CSF for cells (RBCs and WBCs, where possible) and protein and glucose, the remainder will be sent to central laboratory.  CSF will be analyzed for 
PK (post treatment sample only), Aβ, tau, protein, and cell count.  Additional CSF will be collected for storage, as describe d in Section 10.3.  LPs are required 
for all patients and can be performed up to [ADDRESS_488510] is discharged prior to the 24 -hour assessments, these should also be conducted prior to 
discharge.
qThe numbers in the rows refer to scheduled hours postdose for sampling, measured from the startof the infusion .  The “predose” collection indicates that the 
sample should be taken up to 30 minutes before the beginning of the infusion.   The “end of infusion” collection indicates that the sample should be taken as 
close to the completion of the infusion as possible. On the day of dosing, postdose samples should be collected from a different arm than was used to 
administer study drug.   If no spec ific time point is indicated (“X”), a single sample will be collected as close as possible to the dosing time on the previous
infusion day.
rPredoseand end of infusion samples should be collected.  The “predose” collection indicates that the sample shoul d be taken up to 30 minutes before the 
beginning of the infusion.   The “end of infusion” collection indicates that the sample should be taken as close to the completion of the infusion as poss ible.
Postdose samples should be collected from a different arm than was used to administer study drug.

AEs, safety laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs ) andsamples for immunogenicity and PK should be taken ever y 12 weeks until the ti ter returns to baseline 
(comes within a single 2 -fold dilution of the baseline titer), or up to [ADDRESS_488512] dose.  In the case of a patient who se resultis positive at baseline with a 1:10 titer and subsequently develops a 
treatment -emergent ADA response that increases to much higher titers, the antibody titer would need to decline to a titer of 1:20 or less to be considered a 
“return to baseline .”In contrast, if the patient ’s resultis “not detected” at baseline (in an assay with a 1:10 minimal required dilution ), the titer would need to 
decline to either “detected” wi th a 1:10 titer or a result of “not detected” to be considered a “return to baseline .”
tStored serum samples for possible immune safety laboratory testing (including but not limited to β tryptase, total Immunoglobulin E, and immune complex 
testing) will b e collected .  In the event of a moderate or severe infusion reaction event, additional unscheduled samples should be collected approximatel y

LY3002813Attachment 4. Protocol AACDBlinding/Unblinding Plan
Levels of unblinding are indicated in the table belo w. This table provides general  guidance as to
who will be allowed access to rando mization codes at various steps of the trial. The informat ion 
elsewhere in the protocol will always take precedence over this table.  For interim analysis, 
appropriate interim analysis teammembers, including a statistician, a programmer ,and a data 
manager,will be identified and agreed upon between Lilly and the TPO.
Randomization data are kept strict ly confident ial and are accessible only by  [CONTACT_389800].   All measures possible must be taken to maintain 
the blind,whichmeans that access to the rando mization cod e must be restri cted to authorized 
personnel as described in the protocol and summarized in the table below.
Ifthere isa need for unblinding of select people from Lilly  and/or the TPOwho are not in direct 
contact[CONTACT_36362], the detailed process ,including form ation of the unblinded team, creating 
restricted access electronic fo lders, and measures taken to guard against inappropriate 
dissemination of treatment codes (for example, by [CONTACT_389801]), will be described in the unblinding plan or another appropriate 
document and approval sought from Lilly and Covance team statisticians.

Summary
A Single- and Multiple -Dose Study  to Assess the Safety , 
Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics , and Pharmacody namicsof 
Single and Multiple I ntravenous Dosesof LY3002813 in 
Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment due to A lzheimer’s 
Disease or Mild to Moderate A lzheimer’s Disease
Overview
Protocol I5T-MC-AACD “A Single-and Multiple-Dose Study  to Assess the Safet y, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinet ics, and Pharmacodynamics of Single and Mult iple Intravenous Doses of 
LY3002813 in Patients with Mild Cogni tive Impairment due to Alzheimer’s Disease or Mild to 
Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease ”has been amended.  The new protocol is indicated by  
[CONTACT_11827] ( f) and will  be used to conduct the study  in place of any preceding version o f the 
protocol.
The overall changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are as fo llows:
The cohort descript ion in Section 7 has been updated to clarify  that the pati ent numbers 
in each cohort are planned enro llment number s,rather than a minimum required number 
of patients to com plete the study.
The durati on of the follow-up period after administration of a single dose of 40 mg/kg 
LY3002813 has been reduced fro m [ADDRESS_488517] of a single 
dose of 40 mg/kg LY3002813 on amylo id burden assessed usingflorbetapir PET.
However, if the immunogenicit y titer at the last scheduled assessment or discont inuation 
visit is posit ive, then addit ional safety assessments remain the same (see Section 10.4.1).
Section 9.2.3 ( 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_488518] ration) has been amended to allow 
previously conducted 1 8F-AV-1451 PET scans to be used as the baseline scan.

with a minimum o f8 patients (6 LY3002813; 2 placebo) completing planned to be enrolled in
each cohort. Dose escalation will only occur after the safet y from the preceding cohort has been 
established in at least [ADDRESS_488525] 4 weeks after 
dosing for dose escalat ion to Cohort 3. Enrollment in Cohorts 2 and 3 will only co mmence once 
enrollment into the preceding cohort has completed.  Safet y, PK, and PD will be assessed at 
regular intervals for approximately 72 weeks (in Cohorts 1 and 2) or 24 weeks (in Cohort 3) after 
starting the dosing wit hstudy drug(Attachment 1).

7.1.7.Study Design for Japanese Patients
Sites in Japan will participate in this study  to recruit Japanese patients.
At least 2Japanese patients should be enrolled in each dose cohort forCohorts 1, 2, 4, and 6.   
Assuming that the cohorts will be dosed based on safet y reviews, i t is intended that at least 
3Japanese patients will be enrolled in each dose cohort for Cohorts 3, 5,and 7; however, 
recruitment to a cohort will not be contingent upon fulfilling these requirements .  At least 
17Japanese patients should be enro lled in the study when all cohorts are dosed.   Japanese patient 
enrollment into cohorts should ensure sufficient exposures at applicable doses to support future 
studies(for example, at least [ADDRESS_488530] doses to be used in future 
studies).  For the purpose of safety evaluation inJapanese patients during the study , Japanese 
patientsat sites in Japan and up to third-generation Japanese patients at sites outside of Japan
will beincluded.  The definit ion of up-to-third-generation Japanese is defined in Sect ion8.1.
9.2.3. 18F- AV-1451 Dosage and Administration
A total of two 18F-AV-1451PET scans will be performed approximately 72 weeks apart , except 
for Cohort 3 where scans will be approximately 24 hours apart .  During this study , patients will 
receive a single IV administr ation of approximately  240MBq (6.5 mCi) of 18F-AV-1451.  At 
approximately  75 minutes following injection, a cont inuous 30 minute brain scan (6 acquisit ions, 
each of 5 minute s induration) will be perform ed.
Previously  conducted 18F-AV-1451PET scans can be used as baseline measurements, if the 
sponsor approves. During these previous scans, patients might receive a single IV administration 
of approximately  240MBq (6.5 mCi) or 370MBq (10.0 mCi) of 18F-AV-1451.  For each 
patient, the baselin e data originally collected for previous Lilly and Avid Radiopharmaceuticals
studies can only be entered/sent for Study  AACD after the patient signs the ICF agreeing to 
participate in this study .

In apreviously conducted and accepted 18F -AV-[ADDRESS_488531] been
administered with 370 MBq (10.0 mCi) rather than 240 MBq (6.5 mCi) of 18F-AV-1451. In this 
case, the patient would be exposed to an addit ional 2.[ADDRESS_488532] 24 hours apart from the florbetapir scan (for further details on florbe tapir 
imaging see Sect ion9).  The change in grey matter SUVr will be compared to total dose 
exposure.  Additional approaches for tau PET quant itation may be applied based on emerging 
data.
MRI changes in brai n volume over the course of the study  will be explored.  Over an 
approximate span of [ADDRESS_488533]-baseline MRIs will be performed, mostly  for safety monitoring (ie,occurring [ADDRESS_488534] dose).  However, additional MRI scans are included for exploratory  evaluation of brain 
structural  changes (including, but not limited to, whole brain, vent ricle, and hippocampal 
volumes), white matter and tissue microstructure changes, and funct ional connect ivity in brain 
networks at baseline, [ADDRESS_488535] a minimum of approximately
8patients (6LY3002813 ; 2placebo) complete the study . Cohorts [ADDRESS_488536] a minimum o fapproximately 12 patients (9LY3002813 ; 3placebo) complete the study .  
Also, Cohorts [ADDRESS_488537] a minimum o fapproximately 12patients 
(9LY3002813 ; 3placebo) complete the study .

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
1.1 Soft Tissue Sarcomas 
 Soft-tissue sarcomas make up approximately 1% of adult malignan cies and encompass 
approximately [ADDRESS_1245654] active single agent with a re sponse rate of 
approximately 20-25% 2.  In some instances, patients may not be a candidate for either 
one of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_889674].  Prognosis is dismal in the metastatic setting with a median survival of less than 
[ADDRESS_1245655]-line agent in patients with non-resectable or metastatic 
disease who are not candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
 
1.4 Background of Correlative Studies 
 
Sleijfer et al. recently published a translational study in whi ch they evaluated whether 
cytokine levels in the patients enrolled in EORTC [ZIP_CODE], the phase II study of pazopanib in soft tissue sarcoma, correlated with PFS and OS.  They measured levels of 
several cytokines at baseline and 12 weeks after beginning pazo panib therapy and 
demonstrated that baseline level s were not predictive, but that  high sVEGFR2 and low 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_889675] a more  favorable PFS at 12 weeks (OR 0.636, 95% CI 0.413-
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 9 of 52  0.977, P=0.039) and (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.007-1.160, P=0.0318) re spectively.  There 
was also a trend toward high sVEG FR2 at week 12 and increased O S and a statistically 
significant association between l ow PI[INVESTIGATOR_163197] 12 and longer OS (HR 1.061, 
95% CI 1.025-1.099, P=0.0009) 6. 
 
We propose to measure sVEGFR2 and PI[INVESTIGATOR_889676], [ADDRESS_1245656] dose of each dose esca lation, then after steady-state  is reached at 800 mg QD 
(after at least 10 days of 800 mg QD administration). These PKs  will only be performed 
in the first 10-20 patients enrol led at Washington University.

Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 14 of 52  4.3 Assignment of UPN 
 
Each patient will be identified with a unique patient number (U PN) for this study.  
Patients will also be identifie d by [CONTACT_22705], middle, and last ini tials.  If the patient has no 
middle initial, a dash will be used on the case report forms (C RFs).  All data will be 
recorded with this identificat ion number on the appropriate CRF s. 
 
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
 
5.1 Agent Administration 
 
Pazopanib will be started at a dos e of 200 mg BID for four days, then escalated to a dose 
of 400 mg BID for four days (if to lerated), then escalated once  more to a dose of 800 mg 
QD for the duration of participa tion (if tolerated) or until do se reduction, if necessary.  
Pazopanib should be taken orally without food at least one hour  before or two hours 
after a meal. One cycle of pazopanib is [ADDRESS_1245674]  should be instructed to notify t he investigator. 
 Please note that a Monday or Thursday start is recommended to a void weekend blood 
draws for pharmacokinetic testing.  
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines 
 
Patients should receive full s upportive care during the study, including transfusion of 
blood and blood products, and treat ment with antibiotics, analg esics, erythropoietin, or 
bisphosphonates, when appropriate. 
   Anti-emetics (such as prochlorperazine, lorazepam, ondansetron o r  o t h e r  5 - H T 3  
antagonists) may be administered  prophylactically in the event of nausea.  Anti-
diarrheals, such as loperamide, may be administered as needed i n the event of diarrhea.  
Although acetaminophen at doses of < 2 g/day is permitted, it s hould be used with 
caution in subjects with impaired liver function. 
   
5.2.1 Anticoagulants 
 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/[ADDRESS_1245675] been reported in clinical studies with 
pazopanib; therefore, pazopanib s h o u l d  b e  u s e d  w i t h  c a u t i o n  i n  subjects with 
increased risk of severe bleeding or who are receiving concomit ant anticoagulant 
therapy (e.g., warfarin or its derivatives, low molecular weigh t heparin, 
unfractionated heparin).  Subjec ts taking concomitant anticoagu lant therapy 
should be monitored regularly for changes in relevant coagulati on parameters as 
clinically indicated, as well as  for any clinical  bleeding epis odes. 
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1245676] that there will be no clinically relevant pharmacokinet ic interaction 
between pazopanib and hypoglycemic  agents.  Transient decreases  i n  s e r u m  
glucose (mainly Grade 1 and 2, rarely Grade 3) have been observ ed in clinical 
studies with pazopanib.  In addi tion, decreases in blood sugar have been recently 
reported in subjects treated with another small molecule tyrosi ne kinase 
inhibitor, sunitinib[31].  Such changes may require an adjustment in the dose of 
hypoglycemic and/or insulin therapy.  Subjects should be advise d to report 
symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., confusion, visual disturbances,  palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
sweating).  Serum glucose should be tested during treatment with pazopanib as 
outlined in the protocol and a s clinically indicated. 
 
5.2.3 Use of Statins 
 
Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk  o f  A L T  
elevations.  If a patient receiv ing concomitant simvastatin dev elops ALT 
elevations, follow guidelines for pazopanib dose modification a nd discontinue 
simvastatin.  Insufficient data are available to assess the ris k of concomitant 
administration of alternativ e statins and pazopanib. 
 
5.2.4 Medications that Raise Gastric pH 
 
In a drug interaction trial in patients with solid tumors, conc omitant 
administration of pazopanib with esomeprazole, a proton pump in hibitor, 
decreased the exposure of pazopa nib by [CONTACT_3450] 40% (AUC a nd Cmax).  
Therefore, concomitant use of pazopanib with drugs that raise g astric pH should 
be avoided.  IF such drugs are needed, short-acting antacids such as Tums, Rolaids, Maalox, and Mylanta should be considered in place of p roton pump 
inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists.  Separate antacid and p azopanib dosing 
by [CONTACT_728088] a r eduction in pazopanib exposure. 
 
5.2.5 Medications to Use with Caution 
 
In vitro data indicate 
 that pazopanib is a  potential inhibitor for CYP3A 4, CP2C8, 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/[ADDRESS_1245677] on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 metabolism.  Therefore, 
concomitant use of pazopanib with certain medications (substrat es of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C8, and CYP2D6) with a narrow therapeutic window should be undertaken 
with CAUTION due to the potential for alterations in the pharmacologic effec ts 
of these medications or an increased risk for serious or life t hreatening adverse 
events associated with such medications (see below) secondary to the inhibition of specific CYP enzymes by [CONTACT_407185].  In addition, the potenti al for drug 
interaction with such medications, although diminished, may per sist after the last 
dose of pazopanib due to its long half-life (i.e., mean 30.9 ho urs); therefore, 
continue to exercise CAUTION  for at least [ADDRESS_1245678] dose of pazopanib when administering these medications.  T hese 
medications include ( but are not limited to): 
 Ergot derivatives:  dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine (potential increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_889678]) 
 Neuroleptics: pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924] (potential  increased risk for QT interva l 
prolongation, ventricular arr hythmia, and sudden death) 
 Antiarrhythmics: bepridil, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, amiodarone, 
quinidine, propafenone (potential increased risk for QT interva l 
prolongation and Torsade de Pointes) 
 Immune modulators: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus (potenti al 
increased risk for nephrotoxi city and neurotoxicity) 
 Miscellaneous: quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rispe ridone, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], atomoxetine.  
 
The results from in vitro studies suggested that the oxidative metabolism of 
pazopanib in human liver microsomes is mediated primarily by [CONTACT_3962] P3A4, with 
minor contributions from CYP1A2  and CYP2C8.  Furthermore, in vitro data 
suggest that pazopanib is a substr ate for p-glycoprotein.  Subs tances that induce 
or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter the pharmacologic effects of pazopa nib and should 
be used with CAUTION .  
  
Medications that inhibit CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma pazopanib 
concentrations.  Co-administra tion of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is prohibited 
(see Section 5.2.5); therefore selection of a
 n alternate concom itant medication 
with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 is recommended.  
 CYP3A4 inducers may decrease pla sma pazopanib concentrations.  Selection of 
an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme i nduction 
potential is recommended.    
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 17 of 52  Drugs that induce CYP3A4 and may decrease pazopanib plasma conc entrations 
include (but are not limited to): 
 Glucocorticoids:  cortisone (>50 mg), hydrocortisone (>40 mg), 
prednisone (>10 mg), methylprednisolone (>8 mg), dexamethasone (>1.5 
mg) 
 Anticonvulsants:  phenytoin, carbamezepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, oxca rbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
 HIV antivirals:  efavirenz, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
 Antibiotics:  rifampin (rifampic in), rifabutin, rifapentene 
 Miscellaneous:  St. John’s W ort, modafinil, pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]  
 
5.2.6 Prohibited Medications 
 
Medications that inhibit CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma pazopanib 
concentrations; therefore, co- administration of strong CYP3A4 i nhibitors is 
PROHIBITED beginning [ADDRESS_1245679] dose of study drug until  
discontinuation from the study.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include (but are 
not limited to):  
 
 Antibiotics: clarithromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin 
 HIV: protease inhibitors (ritona vir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir,  
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]) 
 Antifungals:  itraconazole, ke toconazole, voriconazole 
 Antidepressants:   nefazodone 
 
Refer to http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/  
 
In vitro studies suggested that pa zopanib is a substrate of P-g lycoprotein (P-gp) 
and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Therefore, absorpt ion and 
subsequent elimination of paz opanib may be influenced by [CONTACT_889697] 
P-gp and BCRP. 
 Concomitant treatment with str ong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP should be 
avoided due to risk of increased  exposure to pazopanib. Selecti on of alternative 
concomitant medicinal products  with no or minimal potential to inhibit P-gp or 
BCRP should be considered. 
   
 
5.3 Women of Childbearing Potential 
 
Women of childbearing potential ( defined as women with regular menses, women with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contrace ptive method that 
precludes withdrawal bleeding, and women who have had a tubal l igation) are required 
to have a negative serum pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_1245680] dose of 
pazopanib.

5.4 Duration of Therapy 
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continu e protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for d iscontinuation 
documented in the case report forms.  In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue indefinitely until one of the f ollowing criteria applies: 
 Documented and confirme d disease progression 
 Death 
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may  cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rul e out continuation of study drug 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render t he patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the inves tigator 
 Suspected pregnancy 
 Serious non-compliance with the study protocol 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Patient withdraws consent 
 Investigator removes the patient from study 
 The Siteman Cancer Center de cides to close the study 
 
Patients who prematurely discon tinue treatment for any reason o ther than withdrawal of 
consent will be followed as indicated in the s tudy calendar.

monitor for overall survival. Pat ients removed from study for u nacceptable adverse 
events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
  
6.0 DOSE DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 19 of 52  As a general rule, if dose reduction of pazopanib is necessary,  the dose should be reduced 
stepwise by 200 mg at each step, and the patient should be moni tored for approximately 10 to 
14 days at each dose level.  If toxicity does not abate during this monitoring time, the pazopanib 
may need to be interrupted and/or the dose further decreased with continued monitoring for an 
additional 10-14 days at each dose level, and so on.   If the toxicity has abated with reduction of the dose and dose re-escalation is considered safe by 
[CONTACT_093], the pazopanib dose can then be increased step -wise back to the pre-event dose 
(in 200 mg increments, after monitoring for 10-14 days at each dose level to ensure that toxicity 
did not recur or worsen).

Information about all SAEs is co llected and recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a 
clinically thorough report. The investigator must assess and re cord the relationship of 
each SAE to each specific study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the completed , signed form by [CONTACT_230016] (fax: [PHONE_002])  within 24 hours to the oncology [COMPANY_001] DS&E department 
with the provided FAX cover sheets.  This includes serious, related, l abeled (expected) and serious,  related, unlabeled 
(unexpected) adverse experiences. All deaths during treatment or within [ADDRESS_1245702] be kept within 
the Trial Master File at the study site.  
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 29 of 52  Follow-up information is sent to the same fax number as the original SAE Report Form 
was sent, using a new fax cover sheet, stating that this is a f ollow-up to the previously 
reported SAE, and giving the date of the original report. Each re-occurrence, 
complication, or progression of the original event should be re ported as a follow-up to 
that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow-up informat ion should describe 
whether the event has resolved o r continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind 
was broken or not (if applicable), and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.  If the SAE is not previously documented in the Pazopanib Invest igator Brochure or 
Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to  the [COMPANY_001] study drug, 
a DS&E associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for 
Health Authority reporting. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Inves tigator Notification (IN), 
to inform all investigators invo lved in any study with the same  drug that this SAE has 
been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions ( S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be 
collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevan t ethics committees in 
accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulat ory requirements in 
participating countries.  To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the pa tient is on study 
treatment must be reported to N ovartis within [ADDRESS_1245703] day of study 
treatment.

11.0 DATA SUBMISSION SCHEDULE 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/[ADDRESS_1245711] – Solid Tumors 
 
For the purposes of this study, pa tients should be re-evaluated  for response 8 weeks after 
initiation of pazopanib and then  every 8 weeks thereafter.  In addition to a baseline scan, 
confirmatory scans should also be obtained not less than 8 week s following initial 
documentation of objective response. 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_141824] i n Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 34 of 52  diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter 
in the case of malignant lymph node s are used in the RECIST cri teria. 
 
12.2 Disease Parameters 
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be reco rded) as >[ADDRESS_1245712] x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_1245713] scan, or >[ADDRESS_1245714] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_1245715] sca n (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline  and in follow-up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 t o <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeni ngeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, i nflammatory breast 
disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-
measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criter ia for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are prefe rred for selection as target 
lesions.  Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should  be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the ne xt largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for 
non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The basel ine sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor r egression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 35 of 52  Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurabl e 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these les ions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in r are cases unequivocal progression  of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken  and recorded in metric notatio n using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as clos ely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the b eginning of the 
treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are a ssessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they  a r e  
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin  nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   Chest x-ray:   Lesions on chest x-ray are accep table as measurable lesions w hen they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by a erated lung.  However, CT is  preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1245716] 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measu rable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain s ituations (e.g. for body 
scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast , spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables  involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measureme nt.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MR I is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as wi th CT, the modality used at 
follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the le sions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the  scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be f ollowed as closely as possible t o  p r i o r  s c a n s .   B o d y  
scans should be performed with br eath-hold scanning techniques,  if possible. 
 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/[ADDRESS_1245717]:   At present, the low dose or a ttenuation correction CT portion  of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal  d i a g n o s t i c  C T  q u a l i t y  f o r  u s e  w ith RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the s ite can document that the CT pe rformed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (w ith IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuri ng cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is  not routinely or serially performed.   
 Ultrasound:   U l t r a s o u n d  i s  n o t  u s e f u l  i n  a s s e s s m e n t  o f  l e s i o n  s i z e  a n d  s h o uld not be 
used as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations canno t be reproduced in 
their entirety for independent review at a later date and, beca use they are operator 
dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be 
taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about 
radiation exposure at CT, MRI m ay be used instead of CT in sele cted instances. 
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these t echniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be use ful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determin e relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete re sponse (CR) or surgical resecti on is an endpoint. 
 Tumor markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If ma rkers 
are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize  f o r  a  p a t i e n t  t o  b e  
considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent pr ostate cancer) have been 
published [JNCI 96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461-3467, 1 999; J Clin Oncol 
26:1148-1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_1245718]-line trials  in ovarian cancer [JNCI 92:1534-15 35, 2000]. 
 Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors , where known residual benign tu mors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any ef fusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met crit eria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response o r stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of  the treatment) and progressive  disease. 
 FDG-PET:   While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning  to complement CT 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'n ew' disease).  New lesions 
on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following 
algorithm:  
 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 37 of 52   Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow -up is a sign 
of PD based on a new lesion. 
 No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If  the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confi rmed by [CONTACT_4654], 
this is PD.  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confir med as a new site 
of disease on CT, additional fo llow-up CT  scans are needed to determine if there 
is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of  PD will be the date of 
the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at  follow-up 
corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not  progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
 FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner s imilar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is th ought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_205991] e-specific 
medical literature for the indication.  However, it must be ack nowledged that 
both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitation s of FDG-PET 
and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means  one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surroundi ng tissue on the attenua tion corrected image. 
 
12.4 Response Criteria 
 
12.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must ha ve reduction in 
short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as ref erence the smallest sum on stud y (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of a t least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also consi dered 
progressions).  Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study. 
 
12.4.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
Amendment 4; Version 06/04/[ADDRESS_1245719] be n on-pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis). 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initiall y above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non-PD:   Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existi ng non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not  a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is ex ceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_205948], and the 
progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_941] r eview panel (or 
Principal Investigator). 
 
12.4.[ADDRESS_1245720] response recorded from th e start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as refer ence for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement 
of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in no n-target lesions may be 
accepted as disease progression.  
Note: Patients with a global dete rioration of health status req uiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported 
as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to  document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

12.4.4 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured 
from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whiche ver is first 
recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the sma llest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measuremen t criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented.   Duration of stable disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as  reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, inc luding the 
baseline measurements.

14.0 AUDITING 
 
Since Washington University is the coordinating center, each si te will be audited annually by 
[CONTACT_295805] (QASMC) unless the outside inst itution has an auditing 
mechanism in place and can provide a report. The outside sites will be asked to send copi[INVESTIGATOR_205143], including source documentation.  The audit  notification will be sent to the 
Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will ob tain the audit materials from 
the participa ting institution. 
 Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the 
audit. Once accrual numbers are confirmed, and approximately [ADDRESS_1245724] of the cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be sent to the research team. 
However, if during the audit the need arises to review cases not initially selected, the research team will be asked to provide the additional charts within two working days.

15.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
15.1 Sample Size 
 
This is a single arm phase II trial. A single-stage design requ ires a total of 56 eligible 
patients to be enrolled in order to provide 81.64% power to tes t the desired 16 week 
clinical benefit rate (CBR) > 35% against an unfavorable CBR < 20% based on the exact 
binomial method at 5% significance  level (actual significance l evel = 4.32%).  Clinical 
benefit rate is defined as CBR = CR + PR + SD lasting ≥ 16 weeks.  If 17 or more patients benefit at the end of the trial, the treatment regimen  yields a higher clinical 
benefit rate and warrants further investigation.  
 
15.2 Statistical Analysis 
 
Clinical benefit rate will be calculated with 95% confidence in terval (CI) based on the 
Wilson score method and compared to the pre-specified unfavorab le CBR of 20% based 
on one-sided exact binomial test.  The serum levels of sVEGFR2 and PI[INVESTIGATOR_889686]'s correlation coeffi cient will be calculated to 
explore their relationship. PFS and OS in the overall cohort of  patients and by 
[CONTACT_889701]2, PI[INVESTIGATOR_889687] 4; Version 06/04/18   Page 43 of 52  analyzed and plotted by [CONTACT_8761]-Meier method with 95% CI. PF S and OS 
probabilities, overall and by [CONTACT_889702] 95% C I at desired time point. 
Cox proportional hazard model will  be used to report resulting hazard ratio and Wald 
test P-values on sVEGFR2 and P IGF in continuous format. 
 
 
16.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
 Washington University requires th at each participating site sen ds its informed consent 
document to be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_889703] 
(or designee) prior to IRB/IEC submission.     Site activation is defined as when the secondary site has recei ved official written documentation 
from the coordinating center that the site has been approved to  b e g i n  e n r o l l m e n t .   A t  a

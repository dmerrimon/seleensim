INTRODUCTION 
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] 
s
yncytial virus (RSV)
 
causes upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_901020], and leads to significant morbidity and mortality in pediatric, 
i
mmunocompromised, and geriatric populations 
[1]
. 
 
Worldwide, 
RSV is
 
the leading cause of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_901021]
, 
infecting 
50
-
70% of all children 
by [CONTACT_901059] 
[2, 3]
.  
About 2%
 
of  
all children will require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443104].  
Infants born prematurely or those with congenital heart 
disease
 
 
hav
e a particularly high risk for 
severe disease, but more than half of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901022],
 
have no identified risk factors.  The 
peak age of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901023] 2
 
and 
3 months of age,
 
but more than half of all 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
s
 
in children under 
5 ye
ars of age 
occur after
 
6 months
 
[4
-
7]
. 
 
 
Other risk factors include a family history or genetic predisposition to allergic inflammation and 
increase in IL
-
13 and IL
-
4 responses or a low level of maternally
-
transferred RSV
-
specific 
neutralizi
ng activity
 
[8]
. 
 
Additionally
, infants hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901024]
. 
 
Adults with compromised immune systems and those 
age
s 
65 
and older are also at increased risk of severe disease
 
[9, 10]

T

economic impact 
of RSV 
in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) 
alone exceeds $400 million per 
year
 
[13, 14]
 
and worldwide, annual RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901025] 3

million
 
[15]
.
 
Currently, there is 
no licensed RSV vaccine
.  A single 
licensed antiviral therapy
, 
Palivizumab
 
(
Syn
agis™
)
, is currently available for prevention of RSV.  Palivizumab
 
is an anti
-
RSV fusion 
protein
-
specific monoclonal antibo
dy
 
(
m
Ab)
 
used 
as passive prophylaxis 
to reduce the frequency 
of severe RSV disease in premature infants
,
 
but is only recommended for infants born at 28 
weeks of gestational age or less
 
[16
-
20]
.
  
Target populations for an RSV vaccine include 
pregnant women, infants, young children, and the elderly.  It is anticipated that 
a
ge
-
specific 
vaccine 
strategies
 
will be needed to generate effective immunity 
across a ra
nge of age groups 
[21]
. 
 
Vaccine
s
 
to prevent
 
RSV
 
mediated disease are both
 
urgently needed and uniquely challenging.  
In the late 1960s, a
 
formalin
-
inactivated RSV vaccine (FI
-
RSV) was associated with enhanced 
disease following subsequent RSV infection
 
[22]
.  Among 
FI
-
RSV
 
vac
cine
-
immunized infant 
subjects (n=31)
, 80% required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901026] d
eaths were reported.  
This is 
compared
 
to 5% 
requir
ing
 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901027]
-
immunized control infants
 
(n=40).  S
evere RSV disease was 
found to be 
more
 
frequent in vaccinees than in the same
-
age general population not enrolled in the vaccine 
study
 
[23
-
25]
.  
Because infants and small children 
are a
 
primary target population for an
 
effective
 
RSV vaccine, the legacy from that trial represents a substanti
ve obstacle for 
development of an RSV vaccine 
for 
antigen
-
naïve infants. 
 
 
Unique properties of RSV have provided 
challenges
 
to the development of a successful vaccine
. 
RSV encode
s
 
three envelope proteins, a small hydrophobic (SH) protein of unknown function, 
an attachment glycoprotein (G), and a fusion (F) protein.
  
Of these proteins, 
only the F protein is 
essential for infecting cells 
in vitro
; although, 
in vivo
, G protein express
ion provides an 
advantage for infection of human airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603]
 
[26]
.  The G protein is more variable than any 
other RSV protein
 
and
 
a
 
high proportion of G is secreted through an alternative translation

initiation site, and acts as an immunomodulatory decoy for adaptive immune responses
 
[27]
. 
 
Non
-
structural RSV g
ene products
,
 
NS1 and NS2
,
 
both interfere with innate immune responses 
through coo
perative inhibition of interferon induction and effector functions
 
[28, 29]
.
 
RSV lacks an optimal animal model.
 
 
Rodent models such as mice and cotton rats are 
only 
semi
-
permissive for RSV infection, 
although
 
they are 
useful for 
defining 
immune response patterns
 
and rank
-
ordering candidate vaccines for neutra
lizing potency and protective capacity. 
 
Nonhuman primates (NHP) 
are useful 
for immunogenicity and challenge
 
studies
, but 
possess
 
variable levels of susceptibility to infection
 
and generally require large inocula intranasally and 
intratracheally to consist
ently establish infection
.  
 
S
ubstantive advances in understanding both RSV biology and immune system development and 
function have 
resulted in a number of
 
RSV vaccine 
development approaches using 
a variety of 
platforms
, many of which have advanced to clin
ical evaluation, including live
-
attenuated 
vaccines, 
chimeric virus vaccines and viral
-
vectored vaccines, usually expressing F, sometimes 
in combination with other viral genes
 
[30
-
33]
.
  
However, none of these designs based on F have 
yet demonstrated vaccine efficacy in clinical trials, despi[INVESTIGATOR_901028], 
emphasizing the need to use an antigen that induces immune response
s relevant to human 
protection.
 
Several trials with RSV subunit vaccines have been conducted in pre
-
immune children and 
adults. 
 
A series of adjuvanted RSV F 
protein 
candidate vaccines administered alo
ne or in 
combination with G and/
or
 
N
 
(nucleoprotein)
 
were deemed safe in seropositive subjects, but did 
not generate immune responses of sufficient breadth or potency to advance into antigen
-
naïve 
infants 
[3
4
-
38]
.  Another subunit vaccine composed of a fusion of a protein G fragment to the 
albumin
-
binding domain of streptoco
ccal protein G elicited robust immune responses in 
seropositive humans, but subjects reported an unacceptable rate of erythema 
purpura
 
[39, 40]
.  A 
version of RSV F 
protein 
in the post
-
fusion conformation formulated without adjuvant has 
advanced to Phase 2 trials
.  Among 
1600 subjects
 
age 
60 years or older
,
 
44% effectiveness in 
preventing all RSV symptoms, 64% effectiveness in preventing lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_901029], and 
a 
4.8

fold increase in anti

F IgG response among vaccinees
 
was observed

undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement as it mediates the membrane fusion process 
required for viral entry.  During this process, it transitions from a

stable 
postfusion conformation.

Rationale for Use of
 
Aluminum
–
Based Adjuvant 
 
Adjuvants improve the immune response to many vaccines 
[47, 48]
.  The most common 
aluminum
-
based adjuvants includes aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, potassium 
aluminum sulfate, or mixed aluminum salts 
[49, 50]
.  Several phenomena contribute to the effect 
of aluminum hydroxide based adjuvants
 
including
: a ‘repository effect’ 
that
 
occurs when the 
antigens aggregate on the adjuvant particle and are de
posited to the immune cell for long 
duration to induce immune responses, a pro
-
phagocytic effect, and possibly the activation of the 
pro
-
inflammatory nucleotide like receptor protein 3 dependent pathways 
[50]
.  Aluminum
-
based 
adjuvants often improve humoral and innate responses and may lead to increased antibody titers, 
rapid induction of responses, reduction in size or frequency of doses, increased breadth of 
responses to overcome pathogen diversity, induction of long
-
lasting immune memory responses, 
and induction of response to overcome poor immune systems in elderly and young children 
[51
-
54]
.  
Based on over six decades of use, a
luminum is 
broadly
 
accepted to be safe, well
-
tolerated 
and effective

I
mmunogenicity data reveal a more than [ADDRESS_1263700] in neutralizing activity in serum from 
antibodies targeting prefusion
-
specific surfaces of RSV F
 
[55]
. 
 
Aluminum adjuvants have been used in vaccines for many decades with a demonstrated safety 
profile 
[56]
.  Aluminum is the most common adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by [CONTACT_901063] (FDA) 
[57, 58]
.  Aluminum
-
containing v
accines have been 
associated with erythema, subcutaneous nodules, contact [CONTACT_180325], granulomatous 
inflammation 
[56, 59]
.  A specific limitation is neurotoxicity in patients with decreased renal 
function 
[57]
. 
 
Aluminum
-
based adjuvants promote strong humoral immune responses, and therefore, are 
in
corporated in vaccines against diseases where neutralizing antibodies are required for 
protection such as diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B 
[
54]
.  The licensed HPV VLP vaccines, 
Gardasil ([COMPANY_006] & Co, Inc.) and Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline) have alu
minum in the 
formulations at 0.5 mg of aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulphate per dose and 0.5 mg of 
aluminum hydroxide per dose, respectively 
[60]
. 
 
As per 
21 
Code of Federal Regula
tions
 
(
CFR
)
 
part 610.15, the amount of alum
inum
 
in biological 
products cannot exceed 0.85 mg/dose. 
 
The amount of alum
inum
 
in vaccines currently licensed 
in the US ranges from 0.125
-
0.85 mg/dose
 
[58]
.  Based on FDA regulations, experience with 
HPV VLP vaccines and VRC pre
-
clinical data
, VRC plans to use 0.5 mg/dose of aluminum 
hydroxide adjuvant in this phase 1 study.

ELISA and other exploratory assays to assess humoral and 
cellular immune responses may be performed with stored samples. 
 
Human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) type may be obtained from stored samples if needed to assess HLA

class restricted 
cellular responses
.  
Additional measurements of antibody, B cell and T cell responses may also 
be assessed from stored samples for timepoints throughout the study as exploratory evaluations.

condition, appropriate evaluations should be conducted based on clinical judgment.  Screening 
evaluations for specific eligibility criteria must be completed within the time in
terval specified 
prior to enrollment for the given parameter and may be repeated, as needed, to confirm 
eligibility.  
Blood samples for research

vent” (SAE) a
s
 
defined in 21
 
Code of Federal Regulations
 
(
CFR
)
 
312.32
 
a
s
 
follows:
 
“
an 
adverse event
 
or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in 
the view 
o
f either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of th
e following outcomes: 
 
Death, 
a life
-
threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or a co
ngenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events 
that may not result in death, be life
-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47022], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and m
ay require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. 
 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsi
ons that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
”
  
 
“Life threatening” refers to an AE that at occurrence represented an immediate risk of death to 
the subject.  An event that hypothetically 
may caus
e death if it occurs in a more severe form is 
not considered life

Compliance 
 
Non
-
compliance is the failure 
of investigator(s) to follow the appl
icable laws, regulations, or 
institutional policies governing 
the protection of human subjects
 
in research, or the requirements 
or determinations of the IRB, whether intentional or not
. 
 
 
Non
-
compliance may be unintentional (e.g. due to lack of understandi
ng, knowledge, or 
commitment), or intentional (e.g. due to deliberate choice to ignore or compromise the 
requirements of any applicable regulation, organizational policy, or determination of the IRB).
 
Non

compliance is further characterized as serious
 
or 
c
ontinuing 
as follows: 
 
•
 
Serious non
-
compliance 
-
 
Non
-
compliance, hether intentional or not, that results in 
harm or otherwise materially compromises the rights, welfare and/or safety of the 
subject. Non

compliance, even if it does not result in 
direct harm to research subjects. 
 
•
 
Continuing non

compliance that either has 
resulted, or, if continued, may r
esult in harm to subjects or otherwise materially 
compromise the rights, welfare and/or safety of subjects, affect the scientific integrity 
of the study or validity of the results.  The pattern may comprise repetition of the

If we do not observe any AEs in a group of 10 (for example, at the dose escalation review), the 
upper 95% confidence interval for the true incidence rate at that dose is 31%; that is, we can be 
reasonably confident that the true rate is no more than 31%. I
f we do not observe any of a 
specific type of adverse events in a specific arm (n=15), the upper bound of a 95% confidence 
interval for the true incidence is 21.8%. Similarly, if we do not observe any of a specific type of

Power Calculations for Evaluation of Immun
ogenic
ity
 
Although immunogenicity is a secondary endpoint, it is of sufficient interest that we briefly 
present the
 
power to detect a difference between immune responses before and after the first 
dose, and between two dose cohor
ts.  Based on previous research
[44]
, we expect the ELISA and 
n
eutralization results to be approximately normally distributed on the log
[ADDRESS_1263757] good power (90% or better) to detect a difference in the 
magnitude of the immune response of approximately .[ADDRESS_1263758] one vaccination and therefore will provide some safety da
ta. 
 
All statistical analyses will be performed using statistical software
 
R
. 
 
No formal multiple 
comparison adjustments will be employed for safety endpoints or 
immunogenicity 
endpoints. 
 
6.4.1.
 
Baseline Demographics
 
Baseline characteristics including demographi
cs and laboratory mea
surements will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.
 
6.4.2.
 
Safety Analysis
 
Reactogenicity:  
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing each type of 
reactogenicity sign or symptom will be tabulated by [CONTACT_926].  For a given sign
 
or symptom, each 
subject’s reactogenicity will be counted once under the maximum severity for all assessments.
 
Adverse Events:  
AE
s will be coded into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) preferred terms. 
 
The number and percentage of sub
jects experiencing each specific 
AE
 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_134344]
. 
 
For the calculations in these 
tables, each subject’s 
AE
 
will be counted once under the maximum severity or strongest 
recorded causal relationship to treat
ment.
 
A complete listing of AEs for each subject will provide details including severity, relationship to 
treatment, onset, duration and outcome.
 
Safety Laboratory Values: 
 
Boxplots of local laboratory values will be generated for baseline 
values and for v
alues measured during the course of the study.
 
 
Each boxplot will show the 1st 
quartile, the median, and the 3

Risks and Benefits
 
8.5.1.
 
Risks
 
Risk 
of 
the DS
-
Cav1 
vaccine
:  
This is the first study in humans of the investigational DS
-
C
av1 
vaccine.  The risks noted are based on risks of vaccines in general.  
 
Potential side effects resulting from intramuscular injection include stinging, arm discomfort, 
redness of the skin, 
or 
mild bruising at vaccine injection sites.  
 
Subjects may exhi
bit general signs and symptoms associated with administration of a vaccine 
injection, including fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, dizziness and fatigue. 
These side effects will be monitored, but are generally short term, mild to moder
ate severity and 
usually do not require treatment.
  
 
There may be side effects from the study 
products,
 
which may be
 
serious or life threatening, 
that 
we do not yet know about.
 
Risks of Aluminum Hydroxide Suspension
:  
Aluminum is the most common adjuvant u
sed in 
human vaccines licensed by [CONTACT_1622] 
[57]
 
used in 
billions of individuals over decades of clinical 
use 
[51]
.  Side effects are generally limited to minor local reactions at the injection site 
[51]
.  
Other more severe local reactions like erythema, subcutaneous nodules, contact [CONTACT_901077] 
[58]
.
  
 
Risks of Mucosa Sample Collection
: 
 
Coll
ection of samples by [CONTACT_128182], in some cases, minor bleeding
.  
 
Risks
 
of Blood Drawing
:
  
Blood drawing may cause pain, bruising, fainting, and, rarely, 
infection at the site 
where t
he blood is taken.
 
Risks during Pregnancy
:
  
We do not know the possible effects of the study vaccine on the fetus 
or nursing infant. 
 
Therefore,
 
women
 
and adolescents
 
of reproductive potential will be tested for 
pregnancy prior to adminis
tration of each 
dose of study 
product
.  Women will be 
asked to notify 
the site immediately 
if they
 
suspect or learn they are 
pregnan
t
 
during this study.
 
 
In case of 
pregnancy, subjects
 
will continue to be followed for safety. 
 
The subject will be contact[CONTACT_901078] a pregnancy that begins during the study.

Other Risks
:  
It is possible that the standard medical tests performed as part of this research 
protocol will result in 
new diagnoses.  Depending on the medical findings and consequences of 
being provided with the new medical information about health status, the study subject may view 
this aspect of study participation as either a risk or a benefit. 
 
Any such information wi
ll be 
shared and discussed with the subject and, if requested by [CONTACT_423], 
may 
be forwarded to the 
subject’s primary health care provider for further workup and management. 
 
Benefits
:  
Study subjects will not receive direct health benefit from study par
ticipation. 
 
This 
protocol is not designed to provide treatment for any condition.  Others may benefit from 
knowledge gained in this study that 
may aid in the development of an RSV 
vaccine.  
The
 
investigational vaccine 
is not expected to 
provide protection
 
from 
RSV
 
infection
. 
 
8.6.
 
Plan for Use and Storage of Biological Samples
 
To be eligible for this protocol, subjects must be willing to allow stored specimens to be used in 
the future for studying infectious diseases, immune function, vaccine response
s, and other 
medical conditions.  If tests 
show evidence of any acute or chronic condition, subjects will be 
informed of the results and advised to seek appropriate medical care for the condition. 
 
In 
general, testing performed at a research laboratory is 
not for diagnostic purposes and results will 
not be available to the study site or study subject.

related safety and immune respon
se evaluations, 
exploratory laboratory evaluations related to the 
type of infection the study 
product
 
was designed to prevent, exploratory laboratory evaluations 
related to vaccine or infectious disease research in general and for research assay validation
.
 
 
 
Genetic testing may be performed in accordance with the genetic testing information that was 
included in the study ICF. 
 
HLA testing may be done in association with identifying factors 
linked with the immune response development or progression of infec
tions.
 
8.6.2.
 
Storage and Tracking of Blood S
amples
 
and
 
Other S
pecimens
 
All of the stored research samples are labeled by a code that only the site can link to the subject.  
Samples are
 
stored at 
secure facilities with limited access including
 
VIP laboratory (formerly 
 
NVITAL, Gaithersburg, MD
,
)
 
and 
VRC Laboratories

Assessment of Causality Relationship of an Adverse Event to Study Vaccine: 
 
The relationship between an 
adverse event (
AE
)
 
and the vaccine will be assessed by [CONTACT_901080]
r clinical judgment and the definitions below.
 
•
 
Definitely Related
. 
The AE and administration of study 
product
 
are related in time, and a 
direct association can be demonstrated.
 
•
 
Probably Related
. 
The AE and administration of study 
product
 
are reasonably rel
ated in 
time, and the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_316027]. 
 
•
 
Possibly Related
. The AE and administration of study 
product
 
are reasonably related in 
time, but the AE can be explained equally well by [CONTACT_316028]
.
 
•
 
Not Related
. There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
product
. 
 
For purposes of preparing data reports in which AE attributions are limited to “
Related
” or “
Not 
Related
”, in this protocol, the “Definitely, Probably and Pos
sibly” attributions  will be  mapped 
to the “Related” category.  The definitions that apply when these two categories alone are used 
are as follows:
 
•
 
Related
 
–
 
There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the study 
product
.
 
•
 
Not Related
 
–
 
There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
product
.
 
Grading the Severity of Adverse Events:
 
The FDA Guidance for Industry (September 2007): “Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult 
and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials” is the basis for the 
severity grading of 
AE
s in this protocol. Several modifications were ma
de to the table as follows:
 
•
 
“Emergency room visit” is not automatically considered a life
-
threatening event; these 
words have been removed from any “grade 4’ definition where they appear in the table 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_33786].
 
•
 
Any laboratory value 
shown as a “graded” value in the table that is within the 
institutional normal range will not be severity graded or recorded as an 
AE
.
 
•
 
Severity grading for hemoglobin decrease on the basis of the magnitude of decrease from 
baseline is not applicable at the
 
grade 1 level; only absolute hemoglobin will be used to 
define grade 1 decrease.  Increases in hemoglobin are AEs only for values above the 
upper limit of normal and are graded by [CONTACT_4546].
 
•
 
Severity grading definition for Gra
de [ADDRESS_1263815] 
(Erythema/Redness and
 
Induration/Swelling) included added text “requiring medical 
attention”.

When not otherwise specified in the table, the 
following guidance will be used to assign a 
severity grade:
 
Grade 1 (Mild):  
No effect on activities of daily living
 
Grade 2 (Moderate):
 
Some interference with activity not requiring medical intervention 
 
Grade 3 (Severe):
 
Prevents daily activity and requi
res medical intervention 
 
Grade 4 (Life
-
threatening):
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; immediate medical intervention or therapy
 
required to prevent death.
 
Grade 5 (Death):
  
Death is assigned a Grade 5 severity. 
 
Only the single 
AE
 
that is assessed as the primary cause of
 
death should be assigned “
G
rade 5” 
severity.

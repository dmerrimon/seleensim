11  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Dose-ranging Phase 2 Study of 
ISIS 678354 Administered Subcutaneously to Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia and 
Established Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) or at High Risk for CVD  
Study Phase  2 
Indication  Patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established CVD  or at high risk for CVD . 
Investigational Drug  ISIS 678354 is a second generation 2ʹ -MOE modified, GalNAc 3–conjugated antisense 
oligonucleotide inhibitor of apolipoprotein C -III (apoC -III). 
Primary Objective  To evaluate the safety, including tolerability, of ISIS 678354 and to assess the efficacy of different doses and dosing regimens of ISIS 678354 for reduction of serum triglyceride 
(TG) levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established CVD  or at high risk for 
CVD. 
Secondary Objective(s)  To evaluate the efficacy of ISIS 678354 on serum  levels of apolipoprotein C -III (apoC -III), 
total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotei n 
cholesterol (HDL -C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL -C), very low 
density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), apolipoprotein B100 (apoB), and apolipoprotein 
A-1 (apoA -I). 
To evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of ISIS 678354 across different doses and dose regimens in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established CVD  or at high risk for CVD .
 
Exploratory Objective(s)  To evaluate the efficacy of ISIS 678354 on serum  levels of lipoprotein (a) Lp(a)  and 
angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) .   
Study Design  This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study.  
After an up to 4-week screening period, including an up to 2- week qualification period 
following an at least a 2-week diet stabilization period, a pproximately 100 eligible patients 
will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive ISIS 678354 or placebo.   Patients  on stable diet 
known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening to qualification 
period without a 2-week diet stabilization phase.   Study Drug  (ISIS  678354  or placebo) will 
be administered by [CONTACT_6567] ( SC) injection every week, every [ADDRESS_607505] -treatment follow -
up period.  Refer to Section 3.4.2 for additional  detail regarding End of Treatment period 
and scheduling of End of Treatment Visits.  
The primary efficacy and safety analysis time point is at Week 25 for patients who received every 4- week dosing (Cohorts A -B) and at Week 27 for patients who received ever y 2-
week or weekly dosing (Cohorts  C and D, respectively).  For patients continuing treatment 
beyond the primary analysis time point additional supportive efficacy and safety analyses 
will be repeated at the completion of Study Drug treatment.  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established to review 
safety, tolerability and efficacy data collected on ISIS  [ADDRESS_607506] given written informed consent (signed and dated) and any authorizations 
required by [CONTACT_10523]

15  Study Drug Dosage and 
Administration  The Sponsor will provide ISIS 678354 in a concentration of 100 mg/mL and matching 
volume placebo:  
Cohort A:  10 mg every 4 weeks ISIS 678354 or placebo (0. 10 mL) 
Cohort B:  50 mg every 4 weeks ISIS 678354 or placebo (0. 50 mL) 
Cohort C:  15 mg every 2 weeks ISIS 678354 or placebo (0. 15 mL) 
Cohort D:  10 mg every week ISIS 678354 or placebo (0.1 0 mL) 
All doses will b e given by [CONTACT_10530].  Self -administration will be allowed after appropriate 
training of patient and/or caregiver.  
Rationale for Dose and Schedule Selection  The Phase 1 program evaluated ISIS 678354 doses of 15 mg and 30 mg given weekly and 
60 mg given every 4 weeks that were found to be generally well -tolerated and to induce 
clinic ally-relevant reductions in TG.  Four dosing regimens are planned for the present  
study, which  are proposed to provide total monthly drug exposures  equivalent to 10, 30,  40, 
and 50 mg administered as 10 mg every 4 weeks, 15 mg every 2 weeks, 10 mg every week, 
and 50 mg every 4 weeks, respectively. These doses are predicted to provide reductions 
from Baseline in serum TG ranging from approximately 30% to 64% at the end of the dosing 
interval at steady -state based on a preliminary PK/PD model developed using the available 
Phase 1 data. 
The present study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of ISIS 678354 in a 5-fold range of 
drug exposure utilizing 3 different  dosing frequencies:   every 4 weeks, every 2 weeks, and 
weekly.  Patients with hypertriglyceridemia will require chronic treatment and thus every       
2 weeks or every 4 weeks dosing regimens, if safe and well -tolerated, may provide 
advantages over weekly dosing in terms of convenience and compliance for patients.   The 
proposed range of doses are expected to provide sufficient data to characterize the dose - 
and exposure-response relationship. 
Adjustment of Dose 
and/or Treatment 
Schedule  Dose adjustments, including dose interruptions, and/or decreasing the dose frequency may be allowed for safety or tolerability after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.  
Study Visit Schedule and Procedures  Detailed information regarding the study procedures is outlined in Section [ADDRESS_607519] patient reaches 6 months of exposure (for 
continuing safety assessments), with a maximal exposure period of [ADDRESS_607520] of the following periods:  
• An up to 4-week screening period, including a up to 2- week qualification period 
following an at least 2-week diet stabilization period where appropriate  
• An up to 52- week treatment period during which Study Drug will be administered 
per assigned cohort by [CONTACT_10530]  
• A 13- week post -treatment follow -up period  
Patients in Cohorts A and B will receive up to [ADDRESS_607521] -treatment follow -up periods according to the Schedule of Procedures 
(Appendix  A).  
 
 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Continued  
ISIS [ADDRESS_607522] of analytes required for the study and Appendix  C 
details the PK sample sched ules.  
Safety and Tolerability 
Evaluations  Safety and tolerability assessments include:  adverse events, vital signs and weight, 
physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs (including serial ECGs in a subgroup of patients undergoing serial PK sampling) and use of concomitant medications.   Safety and 
tolerability results in patients receiving ISIS 678354 will be compared with those receiving 
placebo.  
Efficacy Evaluations  The primary analysis time point is at 6 months (Week 25 for patients who received every 4-week dosing (Cohorts A and B) and at Week 27 for patients who received every 2-
week or 
weekly dosing (Cohorts  C and D)).  
The primary endpoint is the percent change in serum TG from Baseline at the primary 
analysis time point for ISIS [ADDRESS_607523] of ISIS 678354 as compared to placebo at the 
primary analysis time point on the following:  
• Percent change from Baseline  in apoC -III, TC, LDL -C, HDL -C, non-HDL -C, 
VLDL-C, apoB, and apoA -I 
• Proportion of patients who ac hieve serum TG ≤ 150 mg/dL (≤ 1.7 mmol/L)  
Proportion of patients achieving TG ≤ 100 mg/dL (≤ 1.13 mmol/L)  
Pharmacokinetic 
Evaluations  Plasma samples will be taken from all patients for the measurement of ISIS [ADDRESS_607524] -treatment follow -up period.  In 
addition, in a subset of patients (approximately 10 patients per cohort), more frequent 
plasma samples will be taken following the first and Day 169 (for every week and every 
2-week dosing cohorts) or Day 141 (for every 4- week dosing cohort) dose to determine PK 
parameters.  Plasma sample collection time points are detailed in Appendices A  and C. 
The plasma ISIS [ADDRESS_607525] immunogenicity status  
Statistical 
Considerations  The primary efficacy analysis for the primary endpoint will be the pairwise comparison of 
percent change from Baseline to the primary analysis time point in fasting TG between ISIS 
678354 treated groups and placebo group in the Full Analysis S et. 
The data will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with the baseline TG level as a 
covariate.  
Dose selection for the further development will be based on the following efficacy and safety 
considerations; more than 1 dose may meet these criteria.  An effective dose, or dose 
regimen, will be one that achieves a clinically -meaningful reduction in serum TG levels.  
Safety will be evaluated on the basis of incidence of expected and unexpected treatment -
related SAEs, and other specific safety considerations including the incidence of platelet 
reductions.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.[ADDRESS_607531] common unde rlying cause 
of death, being responsible for ~30% of all deaths  in the [LOCATION_002] , according to the Heart 
Disease and Stroke Statistics -2017 ( Benjamin et al. 2017).  
Elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has long been recognized and established as an independent risk factor for CVD, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_474238]- C levels, such as 
statins which have been available for over 25 years, and PCSK9 -inhibitors more recently , while 
showing a benefit in reduction of CV events ( Cannon et al. 2006, Sabatine et al. 2017), have not 
changed the position of CVD as the leading cause of mortality in the western world.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_474239] -C levels with these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the residual CV risk remains high and the rate of 
majo r adverse cardiac events (MACE) ranges from 32% in a 6 year follow -up in the IMPROVE-
IT study with simvastatin/ezetimibe (Cannon et al. 2015) to 12% in a 3 year follow-up in the FOURIER study with PCSK9 -inhibitor evolocomab ( Sabatine et al. 2017).  These results 
indicate that to achieve further reduction in CV events other risk factors also need  be addressed.  
An association between elevated TG levels (especially postprandial) and CV events has been 
suggested by [CONTACT_474265] ( Hokanson et al.1996, Austin et al. 2000, 
Nordestgaard et al. 2007 ).  Subgroup analysis from PROVE- IT TIMI [ADDRESS_607532] TG level >150 mg/dL had an increased risk for 
future CV events despi[INVESTIGATOR_474240] -C levels, while patients with normal TG levels 
achieved CV benefit from treatment with s tatins ( Miller et al. 2008).  This fi nding has been 
recently confirmed by [CONTACT_474266] (BIP) (>  15,000 
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3

24  patients with coronary heart disease followed for 22 years), demonstrating that elevated fasting 
TG levels were independently associated with increased mortality even after adjusting for other 
known risk factors ( Klempfner et al 2016).  
Several non- statin drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_474241] , including fibrates, niacin and omega -3 fatty acids.  Unfortunately, clinical 
trials that evaluated the use of these agents in addition to optimal statin therapy for CV event 
reduction failed to clearly show additional bene fit (Ginsberg et al 2010, Guyton et al 2013, 
Roncaglioni et al 2013, Sampson et al 2012).  As a result of these negative trials and the potential 
harm of these agents the 2013 ACC AHA cholesterol guidelines currently do not recommend routinely adding TG lowering medications to statin therapy in patients with elevated TGs (Stone et al 2014).  
Taking into account the amount of data that links even mildly elevated TG levels to an increased risk for CV events, these negative results of current TG lowering drugs clearly indicate the unmet need for an effective TG -lowering agent in patients with , or at risk for, CVD.  
ApoC- III plays a pi[INVESTIGATOR_37496] ( Sacks 2015 ), and elevated apoC- III 
levels have been shown to be an independent risk factor for CVD, especially when apoC- III is 
present on apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins ( Sacks et al. 2000, Mendivil et al. 2011).  
Reduction of apoC-III levels by [CONTACT_474267]-III mRNA by [CONTACT_368108] 304801 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) resulted in s ubstantial lowering of TG levels in patients with 
hypertriglyceridemia (Gaudet et al. 2015).  
Therefore,  the present stud
 y was designed to evaluate a new approach to lower ing TG and   
apoC- III levels, specifica
lly in high -risk patients, those with established CVD whose LDL -c 
levels are controlled by [CONTACT_474268]- III 
levels place them at continued risk of recurrent CV events, or in patients at  high risk for CVD.  
The study will evaluate treatment efficacy using a range of doses and dose interval treatment cohorts, while further assessing the safety and tolerability of a ligand conjugated antisense (LICA)- based ASO in this indication.  
2.2 Thera peutic Rationale  
Elevated triglyceride levels are thought to play an important role in development of atherosclerosis and subsequently CVD due to accumulation of TRL  and their remnant cholesterol 
in the arterial wall.  ApoC -III is an integral part of this process.  
ApoC-III, a key regulator of plasma TG levels, is a 79 amino acid glycoprotein synthesized principally in the liver ( Ooi et al. 2008, Figure 1 ).  Multiple apoC -III protein molecules reside on 
the surface of apoB -containing lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and exchanges 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_474242].  The majority of apoC- III is associated with triglyceride -rich 
lipoprotein (TRL) in hypertriglyceridemic patients.  In subjects with normolipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], the majority of the protein is associated with HDL (Chan et al. 2008).

The apoC-III gene is located in a cluster between the apolipoprotein A (apoA) apoA-I and apoA-
IV genes on chromosome 11q23 ( Bruns et al. 1984).  ApoC- III ex pression is down- regulated, in 
part, by [CONTACT_474269]- III gene 
(Li et al. 1995).  More recent findings indicate that TRL carrying apoC- III impair insulin 
signaling in vascular endothelial cells and suggest that apoC- III could link dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_474243] ( Kawakami et al. 2006 ).  Regulation of transcription of the apoC- III 
gene is also mediated by [CONTACT_474270] (PPAR).  Activation of 
PPAR -α reduces apoC -III expression, accounting in part for the hypotriglyceridemic action of 
these compounds ( Staels et al. 1995 ). 
ApoC- III is a potent inhibitor of LPL -catalyzed lipo lysis of TRL, which antagonizes lipoprotein 
lipase (LPL) activation via apoC -III (Lemieux et al. 2003).  ApoC- III also inhibits hepatic lipase, 

ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
26  which plays an important role in the conversion of dense very low- density lipoprotein (VLDL) to 
intermediate -density lipoproteins (IDL) to low -density lipoprotein (LDL) ( Mendivil et al. 2010), 
as well as in the remodeling of HDL ( Brown et al. 2010).  ApoC-III has other recognized 
properties as a direct player in inflammation and atherogenesis, which may further contribute to 
its positive correlation with risk of coronary events.  ApoC- III stimulates the recruitment of 
blood monocytes to vascular endothelial cells by [CONTACT_474271], and also promotes endothelial dysfunction ( Kawakami et al. 2006 ).  Taken together, these 
results support the concept that apoC- III is a multifunctional protein that not only regulates the 
metabolism of TRL, but it is also influences endothelial function and cardiovascular risk (Figure 2 ). 
A growing body of human genetic data have demonstrated associations with functional mutations affecting apoC-III gene expression and CVD risk ( Atzmon  et al. 2006, 
Pollin  et al. 2008, Petersen et al. 2010, Crosby [CONTACT_2297]. 2014, Jørgensen et al. 2014).  The 
Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial demonstrated that apoB particles containing apoC-III more strongly predicted coronary events than plasma TG levels ( Sacks et al. 2000).  In 
a substudy of the CARE trial, the plasma concentration of LDL particles containing apoC- III was 
an independent risk factor for coronary events in patients with diabetes, supporting the role of apoC- III in promoting atherosclerosis (Lee  et al. 2003).  Human genetic data have demonstrated 
positive phenotypic associations with loss (e.g., null or nonsense mutations) and negative effects with gain of function mutations.  Recently, a novel nonsense mutation in the apoC- III gene was 
identified in the heritability and phenotype intervention (HAPI) heart study in Old Order Amish that results in lower plasma apoC -III and TG levels and a cardioprotective profile characterized 
by [CONTACT_474272]-C, increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and reduced atherosclerosis ( Pollin et al. 2008).  In another study involving a group of 214 Ashkenazi Jews of 
advanced age (had passed or nearly reach ed 100 years of age), genotype analysis revealed a 
polymorphism in the apoC- III gene ( APOC3 641CC genotype) with a clear pattern of age-
dependent frequency that was associated with significantly lower levels of apoC-- III protein, a 
favorable lipoprotein profile, a lower incidence of hypertension, and greater insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular health, and longevity ( Atzmon  et al. 2006).  In contrast to the Amish and 
Ashkenazi apoC- III polymorphisms associated with lower plasma T G, apoC- III polymorphisms 
associated with higher plasma TG have been recently described as well ( Petersen et al. 2010).  In 
a cohort of otherwise healthy, lean (mean body mass index [BMI] = 24.7 ± 3.6 kg/m
2) Asian 
Indians, carriers of apoC- III variant alleles (C -482T, T-455C, or both) were noted to have 
significantly higher plasma apoC -III and TG levels, and decreased ability to clear post -prandial 
plasma TG from the circulation.  Furthermore, they were also noted to have an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance compared to patients with homozygous wild- type alleles.  
In a recent study of 75,725 Danish participants, loss-of-function mutations in the apoCIII gene were associa ted with low levels of non- fasting triglycerides and a reduced risk of ischemic 
cardiovascular disease ( Jørgensen et al. 2014).  An unrelated exome sequencing study found that 
rare loss-of-function mutations in apoC- III ass ociated with triglycerides carry reduced risk of 
coronary heart disease in a population of European, African, and Hispanic ancestry in a database of 110,970 participants ( Crosby [CONTACT_2297]. 2014).

Figure  2 ApoC- III is a Multifunctional Protein

TG = triglyceride, TLR2 = toll -like receptor -2, VCAM -1 = vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1,

Potential mechanisms that explain how apoC- III in hibition results in triglyceride reduction in 
patients with hypertriglyceridemia include:  (1) by [CONTACT_474273], (2) through 
potentially enhanced activity of other lipases also involved in the metabolism and breakdown of triglycerides, such as hepatic lipase or endothelial lipase ( Kinnunen and Ehnolm 1976), and (3) it 
is known that apoC- III interacts with apoE, an important factor in liver reuptake of lipid particles 
by [CONTACT_37691] -mediated uptake of lipid particles in the liver (Breyer et al. 1999), and 
therefore, reducing apoC -III might enhance apoE- mediated uptake of lipid particles.  ISIS 
678354- mediated reduction of apoC-III could be contributing to one or all of these mechanisms 
resulting in the observed potent and sustained reductions in TG. 
In summary, inhibition of apoC- III by [CONTACT_368108] 678354 is expected to lower TRLs, and reverse the 
pro-inflammat ory and proatherogenic effects of apoC -III.  Through this novel mechanism of 
action ISIS 678354 is expected to effectively lower TG levels and has potential to reduce CV 
risk in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

respectively.   Increased spleen weights (up to ~1.9- and up to ~2.5-fold over control) 
were also observed mainly at ≥ 6 and ≥ 12 mg/kg/wk in mice and monkeys, respectively.

The most noteworthy finding in the monkey study was a marked PLT reduction, which occurred in one male monkey at the mid-high dose level, 12 mg/kg/wk (840 mg/wk HED).  At Day 65, this animal presented with petechia and oral mucosal bleeding with a PLT count of 8x103/µL. This animal was treated with methylprednisolone on Days 65 and 72, and the PLT count quickly 
recovered to 145x103/µL on Day 70.  This animal continued treatment with ISIS 678354, 
without a dosing holiday, until scheduled necropsy on Day 93 (interim) with the last clinical pathology evaluation on Day 93 again showing a marked reduction in PLT count (6x103/µL).  Marked PLT reductions were not observed in the 30 mg/kg/wk dose group (2100 mg/wk HED) for up to 13 weeks or in any of the remaining dose groups for up to 39 weeks.   In viv o safety pharmacology and in vitro  genetic toxicity studies indicate that ISIS 678354: 
• had no effects on cardiovascular (blood pressure [BP], heart rate [HR], electrocardiogram 
[ECG]), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], arterial blood gases), or central nervous system

(Kim et al. 2014).  
• was not genotoxic and did not increase the rate of mutations in the in vitro  bacterial

Taken together, these data support the evaluation of ISIS  678354 as a potential new t
 herapeutic 
approach to reduce hepa
tic apoC -III expression in patients with elevated TGs to reduce 
triglycerides, potentially improve their insulin sensitivity and reduce CVD risk.  
Lower doses afforded by [CONTACT_213305] 3 technology will reduce overall drug exposure in plasma, 
non-hepatocyte cells in the liver, and kidney.  Therefore, ISIS 678354 has the possibility of delivering similar efficacy results with lower dose levels and thereby [CONTACT_474274]- related adverse

31  2.3.4 Clinical Experience  
Detailed information  concerning the clinical study conducted with ISIS 678354 can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. A summary of the study that has been conducted with ISIS 678354 is 
included below. 
ISIS 678354-CS1  was a Phase 1 , double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study 
designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of 
ISIS 678354 administered by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection to healthy subjects (age 18 to 65).  In the single ascending dose (SAD) part of the study, five dose levels (10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 mg) were evaluated sequentially. In the multiple ascending d ose (MAD) part, two dose levels (15 and 
30 mg) were evaluated at weekly dosing for 6 weeks and one dose leve l (60 mg) was evaluated 
at every 4-week dosing for 3 months.  The SAD and weekly MAD dose levels were studied in a cohort of 8 subjects, where 6 were randomized to active treatment with ISIS 678354 and 2 were randomized to placebo.  In the every 4- week MAD  cohort 10 subjects were studied (6 active and 
4 placebo).  In the 90 and 120 mg SAD and all of the MAD cohorts, the pharmacodynamic effects of ISIS 678354 vs. placebo were examined in healthy subjects with elevated triglycerides (TG > 200 mg/dL).   
Result s from the SAD portion of the Phase 1 study showed significant dose -dependent sustained 
reductions in fasting total apoC-III and TG levels.  ApoC- III reductions of -4%, -32%, -65%, -
78%, and - 91%, and TG reductions of -12%, -11%, -43%, -68%, and - 77% were observed with 
single doses of 10, 30, 60, 90 and 120 mg of ISIS 678354 respectively 14 days after dosing.  In the MAD cohorts, mean apoC- III reductions of -65%, -84%, and -83% and mean TG reductions 
of -61%, -71%, and -65% were observed in the [ADDRESS_607534] dose.  Significant dose-dependent reductions of up to ~-30% in apoB and increases of up to ~100% in HDL- C were also observed.  There were 
no notable increases in LDL -C in any dose group.  E ffects were sustained for at least [ADDRESS_607535] dose, consistent with the drug’s long terminal elimination half- life. 
Overall, ISIS 678354 was well tolerated and there were no safety concerns. There were no deaths, no serious adverse events related to ISIS 678354, no adverse events leading to treatment 
discontinuation, and no clinically- significa nt trends in laboratory assessments observed in any of 
the ISIS 678354 Phase 1 dose groups.  Elevations in ALT  > 3x ULN were reported as treatment -
related in 2 ISIS -678354- treated subjects in MAD every -4-week cohort (60 mg).  Both subjects 
had prior histor y of ALT elevation. There were no other treatment related laboratory 
abnormalities in the liver, kidney function or platelet counts and no clinically significant changes in vital signs or ECGs in any cohort studied.  
2.4 Rationale for Dose and Schedule of A dministration  
The Phase 1 program evaluated ISIS 678354 doses of 15 mg and 30 mg given weekly and 60 mg given every 4 weeks that were found to be generally well- tolerated and to induce clinically -
relevant reductions in TG. Four dosing regimens are planned for the present study, which are proposed to provide total monthly drug exposures equivalent to 10, 30, 40, and 50 mg administered as 10  mg every 4 weeks, 15 mg every 2 weeks, 10 mg every week, and 50 mg 
every 4 weeks, respectively. These doses are predic ted to provide reductions from Baseline  in 
serum TG ranging from approximately 30% to 64% at the end of the dosing interval at steady-state based on a preliminary PK/PD model developed using the available Phase 1 data .

32  The present study will evaluat e the safety and efficacy of ISIS 678354 in a 5-fold range of drug 
exposure utilizing 3 different dosing frequencies:  every [ADDRESS_607536] a 2- week diet stabilization period , where appropriate, approximately 100 eligible patients 
will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio  to receive ISIS  678354 or placebo.  Patients  on a stable diet 
known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening  to qualification period 
without a 2- week diet stabilization phase.   Study Drug ( ISIS 678354 or placebo) will be 
administered by [CONTACT_6567] ( SC) injection  every week, every [ADDRESS_607537]- treatment follow -up 
period. Refer to S ection 3.4.2 for additional detail regarding End of Treatment period and 
scheduling of End of Treatment Visits. 
The primary efficacy and safety analysis time point is at Week 25 for patients who received 
every 4-week dosing (Cohorts A and B) and at Week 27 for patients who received every 2- week 
or weekly dosing (Cohorts C and D, respectively).  For patients continuing treatment beyond the primary analysis time point additional supportive efficacy and safety analyses will be repeated at the completion of Study Drug treatment. 
Patients ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years old with elevated plasma TG levels (≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 2.3 mmol/L) 
and ≤ 500 mg/dL (≥ 5.7 mmol/L)) and a clinical diagnosis of CVD or at  high risk for  CVD are 
eligible for enrollment upon meeting the study specific eligibility criteria.  Patients will be on standard-of- care preventative therapy for known CVD risk factors as per current guidelines.  
Clinical diagnosis of CVD is defined as documented coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, or peripheral artery disease (PAD).  A diagnosis of  CAD has to be documented by [CONTACT_117162]: 
• Angiographic evidence of ≥ 50% stenosis of 1 or more major epi[INVESTIGATOR_368017]  
• History of myocardial infarction documented by [CONTACT_368082], and either symptoms of myocardial ischemia, or ECG changes ( Thygesen et al. 2012) 
• History of coronary revascularization 
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
33  • Evidence of cardiac ischemia on exercise testing, or imaging study  
Patients at a h igh risk for CVD are defined using the following criteria: 
• Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus requiring treatment, and  
• Age ≥ 50 yea rs, and  
• at least one additional CV risk factor:  
o men ≥55 yea rs of age and women ≥ [ADDRESS_607538] within 
4 weeks prior to Day 1 (the first day of Study Drug administration) and will include an at least a 2-week diet st abilization period  followed by [CONTACT_79963] 2- week qualification period .  Patients  on 
stable diet known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening  to 
qualification without a 2- week diet stabilization phase.  Patients who are determined to be 
eligible, based on screening assessments, will be enrolled in the study at Day 1 and randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 parallel dosing cohorts, with each cohort having a 4:[ADDRESS_607539]- treatment follow -up 
period. 
3.2 Number of Study Centers  
This is a multicenter, multinational study.  
3.3 Number of Patients  
Approximately 100 patients will be randomized in this study, with approximately 25 patients 
assigned to each of the 4 treatment cohorts. 
3.4 Overall Study Duration and Follow- up 
The length of patients’ participation in the study may be up to approximately 16 months 
(69 weeks), which includes a 4- week screening period that includes a 2-week diet 
stabilization/run -in period for patients not already on a stable diet, and a [ADDRESS_607540] patient reaches 6 months of exposure (for continuing safety assessments), with a maximal exposure period of [ADDRESS_607541] dose of study drug: 
one week post last dose for weekly dosing (Cohort D), [ADDRESS_607542] dose for every 2- week 
dosing (Cohort C), and [ADDRESS_607543] dose for every 4-week dosing (Cohorts A-B ).  The 
procedures scheduled for the Week 53/ET visit ( Appendix A ) will be performed at the End of 
Treatmen t visit.   Following the End of Treatment visit patients will then enter a [ADDRESS_607544]-

4.1 Screening  
Before patients may be enrolled into the study, the Sponsor or designee requires a copy of the 
Study Center’s written independent ethics committee/institutional review board (IEC/IRB) approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other patient directed information and/or recruitment material.  
Patients or their legally acceptable representatives must sign the consent form before any screening tests or assessments are performed.  At the time of consent, the patient will be considered enrolled into the study and will be assigned a unique screening number before any study procedures, including screening procedures, are performed.  The screening number and patient identification number must remain constant throughout the entire trial.  In the  event the 
patient is re -consented and re -screened the patient must be given a new screening number.  
Screening numbers and patient identification n umbers, once assigned, will not be re-used. 
4.[ADDRESS_607547] been completed and after the 
Investigator has verified that they are eligible per criteria in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.  No patient 
may begin treatment prior to randomization and assignment of a unique patient identification 
number. 
Using an Interactive Web -Response System (IXRS), eligible patients will be randomized 
in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio  to 1 of the 4 parallel-dose cohorts (Cohorts A, B, C, or D ).  Within each dose cohort, 
patients will be randomized in a 4:[ADDRESS_607548] completed the study and the database has been locked.  However, if a patient has suffered an SAE (as defined in Section 9.3.3 ), and/or 
when knowledge of the treatment assignment will impact the clinical management of the patient, the Investigator will have the ability to unblind the treatment assignment for that patient using the IXRS.  The Sponsor will determine the point at which all treatment assignments will be 
unblinded.  The Sponsor or designee will be informed of the unblinding of a patient within 
24 hours.  In addition, all S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be unblinded by [CONTACT_1034]’s or designee’s Drug Safety and Quality Assurance personnel for the purpose of regulatory reporting (see Section 9.2).

Confirmation Guidance:  At any time during the study (treatment or post- treatment follow -up 
periods), the clinical laboratory results meeting any of the safety monitori ng criteria presented 
below must be confirmed by [CONTACT_10533] (ideally in the same laboratory that performed the initial measurement) on new specimens prior to administering the next dose of Study Drug (ISIS 678354 or placebo).  All new specimen collections should take place as soon as possible (ideally within 3 days of the initial collection).  
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
46  In addition, as  described in Section 6.2.1 hematology labs should be sent in parallel to the central 
and local laboratory for analysis.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_86556]:  The Investigator may interrupt or permanently discontinue study 
treatment for any medical reason including changes in clinical laboratory results.   
In the event of an initial clinical laboratory res ult that meets a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_107160], study drug must  
not be adminis tered  again until a confirmatory test result has been reviewed by [CONTACT_474281].  If any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37466] (refer to Sections 8.6.1 to 
8.6.3) are met and are confirmed, the patient will be permanently discontinued from further treatment with Study Drug (ISIS 678354 or placebo), evaluated fully as outlined below and in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor or appropriately qualified designee, and will be entered into the post-treatment evaluation portion of the study.  In general, patients who do not meet the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10448].  However, the Investigator and the Study Medical Monitor (or appropriately qualified designee) should confer as to whether additional close monitoring of the patient is appropriate. 
Additional Guidance:  If possible, a PK sample should be collected as soon as possibl e after an 
SAE has occurred (preferably within 2 weeks).  In addition, if a patient is asked to return to the 
clinic for additional evaluations due to an AE, then a PK sample should be taken at the time of the unscheduled visit. 
8.5.1 Safety Monitoring Rul es for Liver Chemistry Tests  
The following rules are adapted from the FDA guidance for industry, “Drug-Induced Liver 
Injury:  Premarketing Clinical Evaluation,” issued by [CONTACT_941] U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, July 2009.  For a definition of Baseline, please refer to guidance in Section 8.[ADDRESS_607576] liver chemistry tests monitored every 14 days (±2 days) for the first 
3 months of the study treatment, and monthly thereafter during the Treatment Period.   Upon 
completion of the study treatment period, liver chemistry tests should be monitored as per visit schedule in Appendix A . 
In the event of appearance of symptoms or signs of hepatic injury (jaundice, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, abnormal bleeding or bruising, or eosinophilia > ULN) liver enzymes and bilirubin should be tested as soon as possible.  Testing at a lab that is local to the patient is permissible for this purpose.  
In the event of an ALT or AST measurement that is > [ADDRESS_607577] (or the greater of [ADDRESS_607578] if the baseline value was > ULN) at any time during the study (treatment or 
post- treatment perio d), the initial measurement(s) should be confirmed as described in 
Section  8.5. 
Patients with confirmed ALT or AST levels > [ADDRESS_607579] their liver chemistry tests 
(ALT, AST, ALP, international normalized ratio [INR] and total bilirubin) retested at least once- weekly until ALT and AST levels become ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_607580] be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by [CONTACT_474282][INVESTIGATOR_213272]  8.6.1. 
Further Investigation into Liver Chemistry Elevations:  For patients with confirmed ALT or AST 
levels > [ADDRESS_607581],  the following evaluations should be performed: 
1. Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior and concurrent diseases  
2. Obtain further history for concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications, 
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets  
3. Obtain a history for exposure to environmental chemical agents and travel  
4. Serology for viral hepatitis ( hepatitis A virus [ HAV] immunoglobulin M [ IgM], hepatitis 
B surface antigen [ HBsAg ], hepatitis C virus [ HCV] antibody, Cytomegalovirus [ CMV] 
IgM, and EBV antibody panel) 
5. Serology for autoimmune hepatitis (e.g., antinuclear antibody [ ANA]) 
Additional liver evaluations, including gastroenterology/hepatology consultations, hepatic CT or MRI scans, may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor and the study DSMB.  Repetition of the above evaluations should be considered if a patient’s ALT and/or AST levels reach [ADDRESS_607582] be promptly reviewed by [CONTACT_737]

Any case of a platelet count reduction to levels below 50,000/mm3 (Grade 3 or Grade 4) is 
considered an adverse event of special interest and should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor .  In this case the Investigator should refer the subject to a hematologist to provide 
diagnostic and therapeutic management.

8.5.4 Safety Monitoring for Bleeding Events 
Patients  will be evaluated for occurrence of bleeding events continuously after the start of Study 
Drug treatment (Day 1) up to th e end of the follow-up period for all cohorts.  All bleeding events 
are considered adverse events and reported on adverse event case report form . 
Bleeding events that are either major or clinically -relevant non-major bleeding (as defined 
below) will need to be monitored and treated, as needed, immediately.  Patients  with a suspected 
bleeding event will undergo additional testing if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_474285] (S)AE case report form will be completed.   In addition, if bleeding is cons idered 
significant, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), aPTT, PT, INR, and platelet count are to be obtained.  In addition, approximately [ADDRESS_607590] be stored allowing for a centralized assessment of ISIS  678354 
concentrations.  
If a minor bleeding event occurs, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor Medical Monitor (or 
designee) and additional testing of coagulation parameters (aPTT, prothrombin time [PT], INR), platelet count, and platelet volume may be performed. 
Major bleeding (MB) is defined as one of the following ( Büller et al. 2007
):  
1. Fatal bleeding  
2. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular if in a major joint, or pericardial, or 
intramuscular with compartment syndrome  
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
50  3. Clinically overt bleeding leading to transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells or 
whole blood or a fall in hemoglobin of 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or more within 24 hours  
Clinically -relevant non-major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for 
major bleeding but that resulted, for example, in medical examination, intervention, or had clinical consequences for a subjec t (
Büller et al. 2007 ).  
Minor bleeding events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for major bleeding or clinically -
relevant, non-major bleeding events (defined above), for example excess bruising, petechiae, gingival bleeding on brushing teeth.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_607591] 
practice guidelines and bring their glucometer or glucometer log printout to every clinic visit.  In 
addition, patients who are not on insulin but use a glucometer should also bring their glucometer and/or glucometer log printout to every clinic visit.  
• The Investigator or delegate will review the glucometer reading or printout at every clinic visit to evaluate if fasting pre -breakf ast self -monitored plasma glucose values exceed 
threshold values as per the Safety Monitoring Rules for Hyperglycemia below 
All diabetic patients will note any changes in their insulin dose and /or oral antidiabetic 
therapy, as well as any hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_37469]. 
• The Investigator or delegate will ask patients at every clinic visit if they made changes in 
their insulin dose or oral antidiabetic therapy, and if they experienced a hypoglycemic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] 
o Patients will be instruct ed on the monitoring and management of hypoglycemic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_37562]  
o Documented symptomatic hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_474249].  Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is defined as 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_37472] ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L)  
o Any changes in insulin dose or oral antidiabetic therapy should be captured into the Concomitant Medication CRF  
8.5.7 Safety Monitoring for Documented Severe Hypoglycemia  
A documented se vere hypoglycemic event is defined as one in which the patient requires 
assistance of another person to obtain treatment for the event and has a plasma glucose level       
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
51  ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L).  The rescue treatment of hypoglycemia may include IV gluc ose or 
buccal or intramuscular glucagon. 
The definition of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia includes all epi[INVESTIGATOR_37473]-treatment and which were thus thought to place patients at risk for injury to themselves or others.  Note that “requires assistance” means that the patient could not help himself or herself.  Someone being kind that assists spontaneously the patient when not necessary does not qualify as “requires assistance.”  
Severe hypoglycemia will be qualified as a SAE only if it fulfills SAE criteria.  
If a patient presents with symptoms of hypoglycemia, the Investigator will need to take immediate action to confirm the patient’s glucose level and treat the patient accordingly.  
The experience o f hypoglycemia may vary greatly from patient to patient.  However, there are 
certain classical signs and symptoms, of which patients should be aware as a clue that their blood glucose may be low.  Common symptoms include headache, heart pounding, confusion, disorientation, numbness or tingling, pale skin, shakiness or tremulousness, increased appetite, anxiousness or nervousness, lightheadedness or dizziness, sweating, and weakness.  Coma could occur if blood sugar correction is not performed.  
If patients suspect they might be having a hypoglycemia reaction, they should check their blood 
glucose using their meters as soon as possible, before treatment if possible, provided they feel it is safe to do so.  If there is doubt about safety they should treat the event first, using some sugar, milk, or juice for example, then obtain and record a blood glucose value as soon as possible thereafter.  The time and nature of treatment should be noted, and especially if any blood glucose result was before or after treatm ent.  It would be helpful for the patient to note if a contributory 
factor (e.g., missed or reduced meals, unaccustomed physical activity) occurred earlier in the day of the event. 
Instructions should be provided to all patients on the appropriate use of a glucose meter.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_607592] dose titration and/or addition of any other anti-hyper glycemic 
agent(s) only when specific threshold values (listed below) are met and confirmed on subsequent testing (ideally within [ADDRESS_607593]).   Any change to the anti-hyperglycemic therapy 
should be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor prior to introduction.  
Fasting  plasma  glucose (FPG) and HbA1c are monitored as per visit schedule in Appendix A  
(approximately every 3 months ) throughout the study.  In addition, patients on insulin should 
self-monitor their plasma glucose (SMPG) routinely on a glucometer.  If a fasting pre- breakfast 
SMPG value exceeds the specific glycemic limit, the patient should check it again on the following [ADDRESS_607594] the Investigator and an unscheduled central laboratory FPG measurement and HbA1c should be performed. 
The threshold values are defined as:  
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
52  • FPG > 270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) or 
• HbA1c > 9% (for patients with baseline HbA1c < 8%) and HbA1c increase of more than 
1% from Baseline  (for patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 8 and < 9%)  
In case of confirmed FPG /HbA1c above the threshold value, the Investigator should 
ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for insufficient glucose control and in 
particular that:  
• Plasma glucose was actually measured in the fasting condition (i.e., after at least [ADDRESS_607595]) 
• Absence of intercurrent disease which may jeopar dize glycemic control.  In case of an 
emergency (e.g., surgery, infection), the Investigator can take appropriate measures for glycemic control 
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate  
• Compliance to diet and lifestyle is appropriate  
If any of the above can reasonably explain the insufficient glycemic control, the Investigator should consider the following: 
• Investigation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in adverse event (AE)/concomitant medication parts of the e -CRF)  
• Stress on the absolute need to be compliant to treatment 
• Organize a specific interview with a Registered Dietician or other qualified nutrition professional and stress on the absolute need to be compliant to diet and lifestyle recommendations 
A FPG /HbA1c follow- up assessment sh ould be arranged after appropriate action has been taken.

8.6.[ADDRESS_607606] Results  
In the event that any of the renal monitoring rules summarized in Section 8.5.2  are met, 
treatment should immediately be interrupted  and the abnormal result should be confirmed as 
soon as possible, but no later than 7 days after the initial event. In addition, upon consultation 
with the Study Medical Monitor, site will obtain any additional lab assessments necessary to determine any alternative etiologies  that may account for the abnormal result. If results from 
additional testing confirm the initial abnormal lab result, future treatment of the patient will be 
determined per the guidelines  below: 
• An a lternative etiology is  identified  that may account for abnormal results :  
o Patient will have treatment interrupted until either:  
 Lab values have returned to baseline, and/or 
 Alternative etiology has resolved/recovered, AND  
 Study Medical Monitor has approved treatment to resume 
• An a lternative etiology has  not been identified  that may account for abnormal resu lts:  
o Patient will be permanently withdrawn from treatment 
The follow-up schedule and frequency of renal function monitoring after the initial event will be 
determined by [CONTACT_474286].  The Investigator should consider consulting a local nephrologist for any change of renal function that presents a concern.  If a renal biopsy is performed, a sample specimen should be made available for examination by [CONTACT_474287].  
8.6.3 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213276] a low platelet count are summarized in  Table 3 below. 
In the event of any platelet count less than 50,000/mm
3, or a platelet count less than 75,000/mm3 
that occurs while the patient is already on reduced dose, dosing of the patient with Study Drug 
will be stopped permanently ( Table 3).  Platelet count will be monitored daily until 2 successive 
values show improvement then monitored every 2-3 days until platelet count is stable.  
Administration of glucocorticoids is recommended for patients whose platelet count is less than 25,000/mm
3.  Recovery in platelet count may be accelerated by [CONTACT_474288].  Treatment guidelines for immune thromboc ytopenia ( Provan et al. 2010) 
recommend Dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days every 2- 4 weeks for 1 -4 cycles; 
Prednis(ol)one 0.52 mg/kg/d for 2-4 weeks then taper; or methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for 7 days (note:  may require continuation with oral glucocorticoids after methylprednisolone). 
In the event of a platelet count ˂ 75,000/mm
3 and ≥ 50,000/mm3, and in the absence of major 
bleeding or clinically -relevant non- major bleeding (defined below; Büller et al. 2007 ), dosing of 
a patient with Study Drug should be suspended temporarily until the platelet count has recovered 
to ≥ 100,000/mm3.  If dosing is continued, it must  be at a reduced dose as shown in Table 3.  The 
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
54  suitability of the patient for continued dosing will be determined by [CONTACT_474289]’s platelet count, whether any bleeding events were experienced by [CONTACT_102], and the speed of recovery of platelet count after interruption  of dosing. 
If, after reintroduction of Study Drug, the platelet count again falls below 75,000/mm
3, then 
dosing of the patient with Study Drug will be stopped permanently.  
Once a patient commences weekly monitoring this frequency of monitoring should continue until 
the platelet count returns to  the normal range ( ≥140K/mm3) for [ADDRESS_607607] notify the Sponsor Medical Monitor (or designee) and the subject should be 
closely monitored (vital signs, lab tests such as Hb, HCT and platelet count, additional outpatient visits , overnight stays and coagulation tests may be needed) throughout the treatment and during 
the post-treatment evaluation period. 
In the event of Major Bleeding or Clinically -Relevant Non- major Bleeding (see definitions in 
Section 8.5.4) as assessed by [CONTACT_737], dosing of a subject with Study Drug (ISIS 678354 
or placebo) may be stopped permanently.  The follow-up schedule for any events meeting this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213278], including the suitability of the subject for resumption of dosing by [CONTACT_474290] (or designee).

A SAE is any AE that in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, meets any of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death  
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
60  • Is life threatening, that is, poses an immediate risk of death at the time of the event  
• An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening”  if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death.  It 
does not include an AE or adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the patient (whether the 
patient is male or female)  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10462], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest  
For the purpose of this study severe reductions in platelet count < 50,[ADDRESS_607623] to expediting reporting to the Sponsor following the same requirements as for SAE reporting ( Section 9.4.1 ). 
9.4 Monitoring and Recording Adverse Even ts 
Any pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a patient prior to the start of the 
study (i.e., before informed consent) should be recorded as Medical History and not recorded as AEs unless the pre-existing condition worsened.  The Investigator should always group signs and 
symptoms into a single term that constitutes a  single unifying diagnosis  if possible.  
9.4.1 Serious Adverse Events/Adverse Events of Special Interest  
In the interest of patient  safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs and AEs 
of special interest (regardless of their relationship to Study Drug) should be reported to the 
Sponsor  or designee within 24 hours of the Study Center’s first knowledge of the  event.  The 
collection of SAEs will be gin after the patient signs the informed consent form and stop at the 
end of the patient ’s follow -up period .  An  Initial Serious Adverse Event Form  should be 
completed and a copy should be emailed or faxed to the Sponsor or designee.  The contact [CONTACT_368140]:  
Attention:    
Email:    
Fax:    

ISIS [ADDRESS_607624] the patient’s last protocol- specified follow -up visit will be evaluated by [CONTACT_10552].  If the 
Investigator and Sponsor agree the patient’s condition is unlikely to resolve, the Investigator and 
Sponsor will determine the follow-up requirement. 
All SAEs considered treatment -related, as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS], will be reported by [CONTACT_368141] 3.6.  
9.4.2 Non-Serious Adverse Events  
The recording of non- serious AEs will begin after the patient signs the informed consent form 
and will stop at the end of the patient ’s follow- up period .  The Investigator will monitor each  
patient  closely and record all observed or volunteered AEs on the Adverse Event Case Report 
Form.  
9.4.3 Evaluation of Adverse Events (Serious and Non -Serious)  
The Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_10463]: 
[IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to the Study Drug  
The event’s relationship to the Study Drug (ISIS 678354 or placebo) is characterized by 1 of the 
following: 
• Related:   There is clear evidence that the event is related to the use of Study Drug, e.g., 
confirmation by [CONTACT_38000]- challenge test  
• Possible:   The event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s medical condition, concomitant 
therapy, or other causes, and there is a plausible temporal relationship between the event and Study Drug (ISIS 678354 or placebo) administration 
• Unlikely/Remote:  An event for which an alternative explanation is more likely (e.g., concomitant medications or ongoing medical conditions.  For reporting purposes, Unlikely/Remote will be grouped together with Not Related)  
• Not Related:  The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_8130]’s underlying medical 
condition, concomitant therapy, or other causes, and therefore, the Investigator believes no relationship exists between the event and Study Drug 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity  
The severity of AEs and SAEs will be graded based on criteria from the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03, June 2010 (refer to Appendix D ).  Any AE 
not listed in Appendix D  will be graded as follows:  
• Mild:  The event is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_368101]’s usual daily activities  
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
62  • Moderate:   The event causes the subject more discomfort and interrupts the subj ect’s 
usual daily activities  
• Severe:  The event is incapacitating and causes considerable interference with the 
subject’s usual daily activities  
If the event is an SAE, then all applicable seriousness criteria  must be indicated (criteria listed in 
Section 9.3.3).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Action T aken with Study Drug  
Action taken with Study Drug (ISIS  678354 or placebo) due to the event is characterized by 1 of 
the following. 
• None:  No changes were made to Study Drug (ISIS  678354 or placebo) administration 
and dose 
• Temporarily Interrupted, Restarted – Same Dose:   Dosing was temporarily 
interrupted or delayed due to the AE and restarted at the same dose 
• Temporarily Interrupted, Restarted Reduced Dose:   Dosing was tempor arily 
interrupted or delayed due to the AE and restarted at the next lower dose  
• Permanently Discontinued:   Study Drug was discontinued and not restarted 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Given for Adverse Event  
Any treatment (e.g., medications or procedures) given for an  AE should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event Case Report Form.  T reatment  should also be recorded on the concomitant 
treatment or ancillary procedures eCRF , as appropriate . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome of the Adverse E vent 
If the event is a non-serious AE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by 1 of the following: 
• Ongoing:   Patient terminates from the trial and the AE continues  
• Recovered:   Patient recovered completely from the AE  
• Became Serious:   The event became serious (the date that the event became serious 
should be recorded as the Resolution Date of that AE and the Onset Date of the 
corresponding SAE) 
• Change in Severity (if applicable):   AE severity changed  
If the event is an SAE, then the event’s outcome is character ized by 1 of the following: 
• Ongoing:   SAE continuing 
• Persists (as non -serious AE):   Patient has not fully recovered but the event no longer 
meets serious criteria and should be captured as an AE on the non -serious eCRF (the 
SAE resolution date should be entered as the date of onset of that AE)  
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
63  • Recovered:   Patient recovered completely from the SAE (the date of recovery should be 
entered as the SAE resolution date)  
• Fatal:   Patient died (the date of death should be entered as the SAE resolution date)

constitute or be associated with an AE.  Examples of these include abnormal laboratory results 
that are associated with symptoms, or require treatment, e.g., bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, tetany due to hypocalcemia, or cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia.  Whenever possible, the underlying diagnosis should be listed in preference to abnormal laboratory values as AEs.  Clinically -significant abnormalities will be monitored by [CONTACT_368142].  Laboratory abnormalities deemed not clinically -significant (NCS) by [CONTACT_37723].  Similarly, 
laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs by [CONTACT_37724]. 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory reports.  The clinical 
laboratory reports will serve as source documents and  should include the Investigator’s 
assessment of clinical significance of out of range/abnormal laboratory values and signatures.  
All platelet count results must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by [CONTACT_368167][INVESTIGATOR_368046] 75,000/mm
3 as specified in Section 8.6.3. 
Any case of a platelet count reduction to levels below 50,000/mm3 is considered an adverse 
event of special interest and should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor as per Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 9.4.1).  
All results of liver function tests must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by [CONTACT_368144][INVESTIGATOR_368025]  8.6.1. 
All results of renal function tests must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by [CONTACT_368144][INVESTIGATOR_368025]  8.6.2. 
Any event meeting renal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_368022] 8.6.[ADDRESS_607626] and should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor as per Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 9.4.1).  
9.5.2 Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Treatments 
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a rout inely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]; the Study Center must document all of the following: 
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
64  • The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled 
(or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the patient’s consent to participate in the study 
• The condition that required the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37615]’s consent to participate in the study and the timing of the procedure or treatment.  The condition is documented in the patient’s medical history  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole reason for the intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
9.5.3 Dosing Errors 
Study Drug ( ISIS 678354 or placebo) errors should be documented as Protocol Deviations.  A 
brief description should be provided in the deviation, including whether the patient was symptomatic (list symptoms) or asymptomatic, and the ev ent was accidental or intentional.  
Dosing details should be captured on the Dosing Case Report Form .  If the patient  takes a dose 
of Study Drug ( ISIS 678354 or placebo) that exceeds protocol specifications and the patient  is 
symptomatic, then the symptom(s) should be documented as an AE  and be reported per 
Section  9.4. 
Should an overdose occur , the Investigator or designee should contact [CONTACT_213340] [ADDRESS_607627] learning of the occurrence of pregnancy.  Follow-up 
information including delivery or termination is reported by [CONTACT_10558] ‘Follow-up’ on the Pregnancy Forms and reported within 24 hours of occurrence. 
Payment for all as pects of obstetrical care, child or related care will be the patient’s 
responsibility. 
Female patients:  If a suspected pregnancy occurs while on the study (including during the 
follow-up period), a pregnancy test will be performed.  The patient with a confirmed pregnancy 
will be immediately withdrawn from treatment with Study Drug.  However, the patient will be encouraged to complete the Post- treatment Follow -up portion of the study to the extent that study 
procedures do not interfere with the pregnancy.  Regardless of continued study participation, the Investigator will assist the patient in getting obstetrical care and the progress of the pregnancy will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and Sponsor may require access to the mother and infant’s medical records for an additional 8 weeks 
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
65  after birth.  Follow -up will be performed to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_368145]. 
Male patients:  The progress of the pregnancy of a male patient’s partner should be followed 
until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous 
abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and Sponsor may 
request access to the mother and infant’s medical records for an additional 8 weeks after birth.  Follow -up will be performed to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_368146].  
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The sections below indicate the overall structure and approach to the analysis of this study.  A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) incorporating these sections below will be prepared  
separately.  The SAP will outline all data handling conventions, including software, and specify additional statistical methods to be used for analysis. 
The study objectives are listed in Section 1. 
10.[ADDRESS_607628] patient has completed the 
primary analysis time point are identified in the following sections. 
The primary efficacy and safety analysis time point is at  Week 25 for patients who received 
every 4-week dosing (Cohorts A and B) and at Week 27 for patients who received weekly or 
biweekly dosing (Cohorts C and D).  For patients continuing treatment beyond the primary analysis time point additional supportive e fficacy and safety analyses will be repeated at the 
completion of Study Drug treatment. 
10.1.1 Primary Endpoint(s) 
The primary efficacy analysis for the primary endpoint will be the pairwise comparison of 
percent change from Baseline  to the primary analysis time point in fasting TG between ISIS 
[ADDRESS_607629] of ISIS 678354 as compared to placebo at the 
primary analysis time point on the following: 
• Percent change from Baseline  in apoC -III, TC, LDL -C, HDL -C, non- HDL -C, VLDL -C, 
apoB, and apoA-I 
• Proportion of patients who achieve serum  TG ≤ 150 mg/dL (≤ 1.7 mmol/L)  
• Proportion of patients achieving TG ≤ 100 mg/dL (≤ 1.13 mmol/L)  
10.1.3 Safety  Endpoints 
The safety analysis will be performed using the following parameters: 
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol   12 June 2019  
 
67  10.3 Analysis Populations  
Full Analysis Set (FAS):   All patients who are randomized, received at least 1  dose of Study 
Drug (ISIS  678354 or placebo), and have a Baseline TG assessment.  The FAS represents the 
practically -feasible intent -to-treat (ITT) population as delineated in ICH Guideline E9.  This 
population will be used for the primary analysis of effi cacy.   
Per Protocol Set (PPS) :  Subset of the FAS who received within [ADDRESS_607630] no major protocol violations that could compromise the interpretation 
of efficacy.  Major violations will be determined prior to unblinding for statistical analysis.  This population will be used for supportive inferences concerning efficacy.  
Safety Set :  All patients who are randomized and receive at least 1 dose of Study Drug.  This 
population will be used for all safety analyses.   
PK Population:  All patients who are randomized and received at least [ADDRESS_607631] error, interquartile range (25th percentile, 75th percentile), and range ( minimum, maximum) for 
continuous variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables will be used to summarize most data.  Where appropriate, p -values will be reported.  All statistical tests will be 
conducted using 2-sided tests with 5% Type I error rate unless otherwise stated.  
10.6.1 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and Baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_1570].  The patient disposition will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  All patients enrolled will be included in a summary of patient disposition.

68  10.6.2 Safety Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
Treatment duration and amount of Study Drug (ISIS 678354 or placebo) received will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Patient incidence rates of all AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_11189], and by [CONTACT_6213].  Narratives of treatment -
emergent deaths, serious and significant AEs, including early withdrawals due to AEs, will also be provided. 
All treatment -emergent AEs, all treatment -emergent AEs potentially related to Study Drug, all 
treatment- emergent serious AEs, and all treatment -emergent serious AEs potentially related to 
Study Drug (ISIS 678354 or placebo) will be summarized. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Lab oratory Data 
Laboratory tests to ensure patient safety including chemistry panel, complete blood count (CBC) 
with differential, coagulation panel, complement, etc., will be summarized by [CONTACT_213341].  These safety variables will also be presented as change and percent change from Baseline over time after Study Drug (ISIS  678354 or placebo) administration, as 
appropriate.  In addition, the number of patients who experience abnormalities in clinical laboratory evaluations will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs and Examinations 
Vital sign and ECG measures will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].   
10.6.3 Efficacy Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy analysis for the primary endp oint will be the pairwise comparison of 
percent change from Baseline  to the primary analysis time point in fasting TG between ISIS 
678354 treated groups and pooled placebo group in the FAS.  The data will be analyzed using an 
ANCOVA model with the baseline TG level as a covariate.  Missing data may be handled by 
[CONTACT_368148] ( Schafer 1997, Schafer 1999).  
The primary efficacy analysis will take place after the last patient has completed the primary analysis time point, and the database has been locked,  
The following sensitivity analyses will be conducted: 
• The primary analysis will be repeated in the PPS  
• The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test on both 
FAS and PPS, and the treatment effect will be estimated using Hodges-Lehmann estimator  
Additional sensitivity analyses may be conducted as appropriate; the details of these analyses will be outlined in the SAP.  
ISIS 678354 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3

69  [IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Seconda ry Efficacy Endpoints  
• Percent change from Baseline  at the primary analysis time point in fasting apoC- III, TC, 
LDL -C, HDL -C, non- HDL -C, VLDL -C, apoB, and apoA-I will be compared between 
each ISIS  678354 treatment group and pooled placebo group using an ANC OVA model 
with baseline as covariate 
• Proportion of patients who achieve fasting TG ≤ 150 mg/dL (≤ 1.7 mmol/L) at the 
primary analysis time point will be compared between each ISIS  678354 treatment group 
and pooled placebo group using a logistic regression model with Baseline TG as a 
covariate.  Proportion of patients who achieve fasting TG ≤ 100 mg/dL (≤ 1.13 mmol/L) at the primary analysis time point will be analyzed similarly  
All analyses of secondary endpoints will be performed on the FAS as primary and PPS as supportive. 
10.6.[ADDRESS_607632]-treatment concentrations of ISIS 678354 in plasma (as total full 
length oligonucleotides, including fully conjugated, partially conjugated, and unconjugated ISIS 678354) will be determined and summarized by [CONTACT_474292] (IM) status using descriptive statistics.  In addition, plasma terminal 
elimination half -life of ISIS  [ADDRESS_607633]- treatment follow -up data if 
data permits.  
Additionally , for patients in the PK subgroup only, PK parameters will be calculated using non-
compartmental methods. The maximum plasma concentration (C
max) and time to reach C max 
(Tmax) values will be ob tained directly from the plasma concentration-time data. The area under 
the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC) values after the first dose and steady -state dose will 
be calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Other PK parameters may be calculated at the discretion of the PK scientist. Plasma PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics with and without stratification by [CONTACT_84308].  
Exposure-response relationships between selected PD [e.g., TG] and PK measures (e.g., plasma trough c oncentrations) may be explored (including with and without stratification by [CONTACT_10638]) 
in this study, or in a separate population PK analysis combined with other clinical studies. 
The immunogenicity (IM) of ISIS 678354 will be assessed before, during, and after treatment 
with Study Drug (ISIS 678354 or placebo).  The IM incidence (number) and incidence rate (percent) will be summarized at each evaluated study time point and at the patient level by [CONTACT_10566], as the total number of and percent of evaluated patients with antibody negative, positive, and unknown status.  Study patients with positive anti-ISIS 678354 antibody status may be further classified (when applicable) as being either ‘persistent’, ‘transient’, or not determinable.  Potential re lationships of immunogenicity with selected efficacy, safety, and PK 
measures may be evaluated.  
Additional details regarding the PK and immunogenicity analysis will be described in the SAP.

[CONTACT_474335]:  SOP- GDO- WW- [ADDRESS_607677] or secondary cardiovascular (CV) 
events even in patients with well controlled LDL -C levels. Elevated triglyceride levels are thought to 
play an important role in development of atherosclerosis and subsequently CV disease (CVD) due to 
accumulation of triglyceride- rich lipoproteins (TRL) and their remnant cholesterol in the arterial wall 
(Nordestgaard and Varbo, 2014 ). 
Apolipoprotein C- III (apoC -III), a 79 amino acid glycoprotein synthesized principally in the liver, is a 
key regulator of plasma triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. ApoC- III determines serum 
triglyceride  levels by [CONTACT_474296], by [CONTACT_474297] (LPL) activity as wel l as 
by [CONTACT_474298], thus leading to increased levels of chylomicrons and TRLs  (Norata et al. 2015
). Genome wide significance studies have shown that individuals with loss of 
function mutatio ns in APOC3 gene exhibited reduced serum triglyceride  levels, reduced coronary 
heart disease, and increased longevity, thus providing the evidence for APOC3 gene as a target for CVD risk reduction (
Jorgensen et al. 2014 ). 
AKCEA- APOCIII -LRx (ISIS  678354) is a second- generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drug 
targeted to apoC-III that has been covalently bonded to triantennary N- acetyl galactosamine 
(GalNAc 3), a high-affinity ligand for the hepatocyte- specific asialogly coprotein receptor to form an 
ASO- GalNAc 3 conjugate. This GalNAc 3-conjugate approach results in enhanced ASO delivery to 
hepatocytes vs. non- parenchymal cells , therefore increases ASO potency and  allows to achieve a 
therapeutic benefit  at a lower dose ( Crooke et al. 2019 ). In the Phase 1 study in subjects with 
hypertriglyceridemia treatment with AKCEA -APOCIII -LRx significantly decreased plasma apoC -III 
protein levels and triglyceride  levels by [CONTACT_46431] 90% and over 70%, respectively at the highest dose 
used. 
Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate this new approach to lowering triglycerides  by 
[CONTACT_81778] -III levels, specifically in high -risk patients, those with established CVD or at high r isk 
for CVD, whose LDL -C levels are controlled by [CONTACT_474299].

  1.1 Study Overview  
The study ISIS 678354- CS2 is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, 
dose- ranging study being conducted a t approximately 32 sites in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada. 
Patients ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years old with elevated plasma triglyceride  levels (≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 2.3 
mmol/L) and ≤ 500 mg/dL (≥ 5.7 mmol/L)) and a clinical diagnosis of established CVD , or at high 
risk for CVD (as defined in the study protocol), will be eligible for enrollment upon meeting the study 
specific eligibility criteria. Patients will be on standard -of-care preventative therapy for known CVD 
risk factors as per current guidelines. The study is comprise d of the following periods:  
• Screening : An up to [ADDRESS_607680] 2- week diet stabilization period, where appropriate. Patients on a stable 
diet known to the investigator and clinically followed at the site may go from Screening t o 
the qualification visit without a 2 -week diet stabilization phase .  
• Treatment Period : Following qualification , up to approximately 100 eligible patients will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the 4 dosing cohorts as shown in Table 1 , with each 
cohort having a 4:1 ratio to receive ISIS 678354 or matching volume of placebo, respectively, 
by [CONTACT_10530].

  The End of Treatment (EoT) visit for all patients should be scheduled no later than the EoT 
visit of the last patient to reach [ADDRESS_607684] dose of Study Drug: one week post last dose for weekly treatment (Cohort D), [ADDRESS_607685] dose for every 2 -week treatment (Cohort C), and [ADDRESS_607686] dose for every 4 -week treatment (Cohorts A -B). For any patient whose EoT 
visit would occur later than the EoT visit for the last patient to reach 6 months of exposure, 
the prim ary endpoint visit (Week 25 or Week 27 depending on Cohort) will count as the EoT 
visit.  
• Post-Treatment Follow -up Period : After the EoT visit has been  completed, patients will 
enter the 13- week post -treatment follow -up period and will return to the Study Center for [ADDRESS_607687] EoT visit.  
1.2 Objectives

  and D). For patients continuing treatment beyond the PAT  additional supportive efficacy and safety 
analyses will be repeated at the completion of Study Drug treatment.  A final analysis will be 
conducted after all patients have completed their post -treatment follow -up visits. 
1.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Percent change in fasting triglyceride level from Baseline to the  PAT .  
1.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints are the following at the PAT : 
• Percent change from Baseline in apoC -III, TC, LDL -C, HDL -C, non- HDL -C, VLDL -C, 
apoB, and apoA -I  
• Proportion of patients who achieve serum triglycerides  ≤ 150 mg/dL ( ≤ 1.7 mmol/L)  
• Proportion of patients who achiev e triglycerides  ≤ 100 mg/dL ( ≤ 1.13 mmol/L)   
1.4.3 Exploratory Endpoints 
Percent change in Lp(a) , remnant cholesterol,  and ANGPTL3  from Baseline to the PAT . 
Remnant cholesterol will be calculated using the following formula:

CRF will be used to determine whether the medications are prior or concomitant to the treatment period. Missing or partial dates will be imputed as outlined in Section 3.7.1.  Prior medications 
include medications that started prior to the first dose of Study Drug from the time the patient has 
signed the informed consent, regardless whether continued while on treatment or not. A concomitant 
medication is any drug or substance (including over -the-counter (OTC) medications, herbal 
medications and vitamin supplements) administered between first administration of study drug and 
the end of the post- treatment follow -up period.  A prior medication with an imputed stop date that is 
missing or on or after date of first dose of Study D rug will also be considered as a concomitant 
medication . Medications will be classified based on imputed start and imputed stop dates as follows:

  3.3 Primary Analyses  
3.3.1 Primary Endpoint Definition  
The primary endpoint is the percent change in fasting triglycerides from baseline to the primary 
analysis time point. The primary analysis time point is Week 25 for patients in Cohort A and B, and Week 27 for Cohort C and D.  
3.3.2 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy analysis for the primary endpoint will be the pairwise comparison of percent 
change from baseline to the primary analysis time point in fasting triglycerides  between ISIS 678354 
treated groups and pooled placebo group in the FAS .  
The percent change from baseline in triglycerides will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with 
treatment group as a fixed factor and log -transformed baseline triglycerides as a covariate. The 
ANCOVA model will use log(Y/X) as dependent variable, where Y is the post- baseline value of 
triglycerides and X is the baseline value of the triglyceride. The model will provide an estimate of the 
log ratio, which will then be converted back to the original ratio scale. The percent change from 
baseline will then be esti mated based on the estimated ratio. Patients with missing primary endpoint 
will have their fasting triglyceride value imputed using the multiple imputation method described 
below. 
Missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint will be handled by a multiple imputation model that 
contains the following variables: log-transformed baseline fasting triglyceride value, log- transformed 
fasting post- baseline triglyceride values, stratified by [CONTACT_3148] ( Schafer 1997 ; Schafer 1999
). 
Imputation of missing data will be conducted under a working assumption of missing at random 
(MAR), meaning that the propensity for a data point to be missing is not related to the missing data, but it is rel ated to some of the observed data. 
The imputations will be performed for post- baseline visits. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
method will be used under the multivariate normality assumption to impute the missing primary endpoint by [CONTACT_1570] (IS IS 678354 treatment group or pooled placebo treatment group). In 
order to be compliant with the normality assumption, baseline and post- baseline triglyceride data will  
be log-transformed prior to the imputation process and will be reverted  when creating the imputed 
dataset. The MCMC method will impute [ADDRESS_607735], where the median value across the imputed datasets will be used for patients with missing endpoint. 
The primary endpoint will be compared between each IS IS 678354 treatment group and the pooled 
placebo group for each of the 100 imputed datasets. The estimates from the 100 fitted models will be 
combined to provide an overall estimate, with corresponding CIs and p-value (
Little and Rubin, 
2002 ).  Results from the ANCOVA model will be tabulated by [CONTACT_368108] [ADDRESS_607736] Document Version No . Final 1.0

  Mean (SD) percent change over time in fasting triglycerides will be plotted by [CONTACT_368108] 678354 treatment 
group and pooled placebo group, until there are fewer than 10% of the FAS/PPS population at a given 
visit.  Waterfall plots of by -patient percent changes from baseline to the primary analysis time point 
will also be provided.  
The primary efficacy analysis will take place after the last patient has completed the primary analysis 
time point, and the database has been locked.  
All primary efficacy data will be provided in data listings.   
The sample SAS code for the ANCOVA model can be found below: where the baseline and post -
baseline values  will be log -transformed first.  Log (post -baseline/baseline) calculated as log (post -

3.3.3 Sensitivity Analyses of Primary Endpoint 
In addition to the primary efficacy analysis, the following sensitivity analyses will be conducted on 
the FAS . 
Sensitivity Analysis 1  (Per Protocol Set) : The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated, using the 
PPS population. 
Sensitivity Analysis 2 and 3  (Non -Parametric Analyses) : The primary efficacy endpoint will be 
analyzed using a non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test using both the FAS and the PPS. Missing 
data will be handled using the same MCMC multiple imputation method as the primary analysis. The

[CONTACT_474335]:  SOP- GDO- WW- [ADDRESS_607740] will be estimated using the Hodges- Lehmann estimator of the location shift between 
ISIS 678354 treatment groups and the pooled placebo group. Asymptotic 95% CI and corresponding 
p-values will be provided. 
Sensitivity Analysis 4  (FAS) Using controlled imputations (pattern mixture models [PMM] with 
ANCOVA) will be conducted to assess the robustness of the missing at random assumption. With this 
approach, missing not at random (MNAR) is assumed, and the mean function for the missing data from patients treated with ISI S [ADDRESS_607741]-discontinuation t riglyceride values imputed using estimates from 
the placebo patients using the copy increment from reference (CIR) approach, detailed in (
Carpenter 
et al. 2013 ). The assumption is based on the premise that when a patient discontinues treatment due to 
informative missing data, at the time of discontinuation they would progress in a similar manner as 
placebo- treated patients. Otherwise, non -informative missing data will be imputed using the same 
MCMC method as the primary analysis, since it is assumed that those patients would have continued in a similar manner to similar patients in their own treatment group who remained on the study. Therefore, the missing data f or these patients is expected to be missing at random.  
Sensitivity Analysis 5  (FAS) An ANCOVA will be performed on the primary efficacy endpoint 
without applying any imputation for missing data.    
Sensitivity Analysis 6  (FAS) A repeated measures analyses will be performed on the fasting 
triglyceride endpoint.  The percent change from baseline in triglycerides will be analyzed using an 
MMRM model with treatment group as a fixed factor, log -transformed baseline triglycerides and 
timepoint as covariates. If log transformation is applied, the analysis will carry the same conditions as 
the primary efficacy analysis for back transformation.  No imputation of data is applied to this analysis. Analysis visits beyond PAT (Week 29, 37, 45, and 53) will be included only if the total n at 
the analysis visit is at least 10% of the overall FAS . Visit mappi[INVESTIGATOR_474260] A

• Percent change from baseline  at the primary analysis time point in fasting apoC- III, TC, 
LDL -C, HDL -C, non- HDL -C, VLDL -C, apoB, and apoA- I will be compared between each 
ISIS 678354 group and pooled placebo group using an ANCOVA model with log -
transformed b aseline as covariate . The ANCOVA model without applying any imputation for 
missing data will use log(Y/X) as dependent variable, where Y is the post -baseline lipid value 
and X is the baseline lipid value.   
• Proportion of patients who achieve fasting triglycerides ≤ 150 mg/dL (≤ 1.7 mmol/L) at the primary analysis time point with MCMC imputation will be compared between each ISIS 
678354 treatment group and pooled placebo group using a logistic regression model with baseline triglycerides as a covariate.  
• Proportion of patients who achieve fasting triglycerides ≤ 100 mg/dL (≤ 1.13 mmol/L) at the primary analysis time point with MCMC imputation will be compared between each ISIS 
678354 treatment group and pooled placebo group using a logistic regression model with 
baseline triglycerides as a covariate.

  3.6 Pharmacokinetic and Anti -Drug Antibody analysis  
3.6.1 Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis  
All PK data analysis will be conducted using the PK Population except the listing of PK 
concentrations which will be conducted on the Safety Set. 
The concentrations of ISIS  678354 in plasma expressed as ISIS 678354- equivalent (as total 
full-length oligonucleotides, including fully conjugated, partially conjugated, and unconjugated 
ISIS 678354) will be summarized by [CONTACT_474313]. In addition, plasma terminal elimination half- life of 
ISIS [ADDRESS_607751]- treatment follow -up data if data permits.  
Additionally, for patients in the PK subgroup only, PK parameters will be calculated using non-
compartmental methods. The maximum plasma concentration (C max) and time to reach C max (T max) 
values will be obtained directly from the plasma concentration-time data. The area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve (AUC) values after the first dose (AUC 0-24h) and steady- state dose (AUC 0-24h 
and AUC tau) will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. Other PK parameters may be 
calculated at the discretion of the Sponsor. Plasma PK parameters will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics with and without stratification by [CONTACT_474314].  
Exposure-response relationships between selected lipid and PK measures (e.g., plasma trough concentrations) may be explored in a separate population PK/PD analysis combined with other 
clinical studies.  
3.6.2 Anti-Drug Antibody Data Analysis 
All ADA data analysis will be conducted using the Safety Set.  
The ADA of ISIS  678354 will be assessed before, during, and after treatment with Study Drug 
(ISIS  678354 or placebo). The ADA incidence will be summarized by [CONTACT_474315], as the total number of and percent of evaluated patients with ADA negative, 
positive, and unknown status. Patient ADA status (positive, negative or unknown) for all evaluable patients, along with the study day associated with the first emergence of ADA positivity (i.e., onset of ADA), the last positive ADA status observed, and peak ADA titer will be listed by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Potential relationsh ips of ADA with selected efficacy, safety, and PK measures may be evaluated.  
3.7 Safety Analyses 
All safety analyses will use the Safety Set unless otherwise specified. Unless noted otherwise, 
denominators for all tables will be number of patients  in the SS. S afety endpoints including laboratory 
assessments and vital signs will be analyzed by [CONTACT_474316] . 
Adverse events, concomitant medications, safety shift tables, and all tables related to safety monitoring/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_474261] 2 periods: on- treatment and on -study. On- treatment 
assessment is defined as the assessment from the first dose to the last dose of Study Drug plus one 
dosing interval. For Cohorts A and B, on- treatment period spans time from first dose to the last dose

3.7.1 Imputation of Missing/Partial Dates  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
For AEs, the following imputation rules will be applied to impute start dates under conservative 
principles:  
• If year, month and day are all missing then assign the date of first dose of Study Drug 
• If month and day are missing, and year is : 
o the same as the year of the first dose of Study Drug then assign the month-day of first 
Study D rug 
o earlier than the year of the first dose of Study Drug then assign December [ADDRESS_607756] dose of Study Drug then assign January 1  
• If only da y is missing , and month- year is : 
o the same as the month -year of the first dose of Study Drug then assign the day of first 
Study Drug  
o earlier than the month -year of the first dose of Study Drug then a ssign the last day of the 
month  
o after the month -year of t he first dose of Study Drug then as sign the first day of the month  
Imputation will be performed for the end date only if the day or month is missing ( i.e., year is 
present) for a resolved AE as follows:  
• If month and day are missing, and year is  
o the same as  the year of the last dose of Study Drug then assign the month -day of the last 
dose of Study Drug  
o otherwise, assign December 31  
• If only day is missing,  then a ssign the last day of the month  
If the imputed start date is later than the imputed end date , then set the imputed start date to the 
imputed end date.  
Analysis period (on-treatment and on-study) will be assigned by [CONTACT_474317]/end date.

  [IP_ADDRESS] Prior/Concomitant Medications  
For prior/concomitant medications, the following imputation rules will be applied to impute start 
dates under conservative principles: 
• If year, month and day are all missing, then assign the date of first dose of Study Drug  
• If month and day are missing and ye ar is: 
o earlier than the year of the first dose of Study Drug then assign December 31 
o otherwise, assign January 1  
• If only day is missing, and month- year is : 
o earlier than the month -year of the first dose of Study Drug then assign the last  day of the 
month  
o otherwise, assign the first  day of the month  
Imputation will be performed for the end date only if the day or month is missing ( i.e., year is 
present) for a stopped prior/concomitant medication as follows:  
• If month and day are missing, then assign December 31  
• If only day is missing, then a ssign the last day of the month  
If the imputed start date is later than the imputed end date , then set the imputed start date to the 
imputed end date.  
Analysis period will be assigned by [CONTACT_474318]/end date with the period 
start/end date.  
3.7.2 Adverse Events  
All AEs  will be coded by [CONTACT_67503] (MedDRA) version 20.1.  
Missing or partial dates will be imputed as outlined in S ection 3.7.1.   
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as adverse events that occurred after the 
first dose of Study Drug. If the imputed onset date/time is the same as or after the date/time of the 
first dose of Study Drug, then the event is treatment emergent. An AE with a completely missing start 
date will be assumed to be treatment emergent.  
In the situation where change in severity (but no change in seriousness) occurs for an AE , study sites 
are instructed to enter an end date for the original AE and start a new record for the AE with a new 
severity reported. In the new record, the changed severity is to be recorded and the start date will be set to be the end date of the previous record. 
When counting the total number of treatment -emergent events  for table display , events reporting an 
increase in severity will  be counted as separate events.

  additional measurements will be performed including: microscopic examination, urine 
protein/creatinine ratio  (UPCR) , urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) . 
• Renal Urine Biomarkers:  NGAL, NAG, KIM -1, Cys tatin-C   
• Other assessments (glycemic control) : plasma insulin , fasting plasma glucose , homeostatic 
model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA- IR) as provided in the central laboratory data , 
fructosamine, glycated albumin , and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)  
Missing WBC differential absolute counts and percentages will be derived: If WBC differential 
absolute counts are missing, and percentages are available, then absolute counts will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_84297]. Conversely, if absolute count is available, and percentage is missing, then percentage will be calculated by [CONTACT_84298]. If neutrophil counts and percentages are missing, and segmented neutrophil and band 
neutrophil results are available, then neutrophils will be calculated by [CONTACT_474329]. 
Quantitative laboratory measurements reported as ‘< X’, i.e. below the lower limit of quantification 
(BLQ), or ‘>  X’, i.e. above the upper limit of quantification (ULQ), i.e. outside the limit of 
quantification, will be converted to X (or limit of quantification) for the purpose of quantitative summaries.  If urine albumin/creatine ratio (UACR) or urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) is 
‘Cannot calc’ indicating urine albumin or urine protein in the below quantification range, UACR and UPCR will be calculated as the ratio of urine albumin or urine protein to urine creatinine after 
converting urine albumin or urine protein to the limit of quantification. 
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is based on the Chronic Kidney Disease-
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_368010] (CKD-EPI) Equation and is provided as a parameter in the central laboratory data.  
Chemistry, hematology, inflammatory panel, coagulation, other assessments, renal biomarkers,  and 
quantitative u rinalysis ( observed value, absolute and percent change from baseline) will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard error, standard deviation, median, P25, P75, minimum, and maximum , mea n 95% CI ) by [CONTACT_474330]. HOMA- IR and plasma 
insulin  will be summarized only in patients not treated with insulins or insulin analogues. Qualitative 
urinalysis will be summarized using counts and percentages by [CONTACT_474330]. Lab 
summary table  except for platelet count  will be base d on the scheduled visits in central lab data only 
with the results in  original unit . The summary table of platelet count will be based on the scheduled 
visits in central and separately in local lab data with the results in original unit.  
All laboratory test results will be listed separately for local and central labs at  scheduled and 
unscheduled visits with results in original unit .  
A confirmed laboratory value is based on consecutive lab values performed on a different day to, but 
within 7 days (no matter central lab data or local lab data). If consecutive value is same or worse, then 
the initial value is confirmed. If the consecutive value is better , then the initial value is confirmed 
using consec utive value.  If there is no retest within [ADDRESS_607768] Document Version No . Final 1.0

Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (September 2007) .  Number 
and proportion of patients with shift from baseline to worst post -baseline values by [CONTACT_474331] -treatment and on-study periods. Post -baseline lab results are defined  as any 
assessment taken after the first dose no matter central lab or local lab data.  If a patient has no  
baseline value but has a post -baseline value, then the baseline assessment will be labeled as 
“unknown”.  Likewise, if a patient has a baseline value but has no post- baseline value, then the worst 
value will be labeled as “unknown”. Shift tables for eGFR, ALT, AST and total bilirubin will be provided using original and confirmed values.

Study Number:  
CTAP101 -CL-4001  
Study Phase:  4 
Objectives:  
The objectives of this study are to  assess  the repeated -dose safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic  (PK)  
 profiles  of CTAP101  Capsules, IR calcifediol, high -dose 
cholecalciferol, and paricalcitol plus low -dose cholecalciferol  in patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease  (CKD) and vitamin D 
insufficiency (VDI).  
Study Design:   
This is a phase 4, multi -center, [ADDRESS_171747] 18 years with stage 3 or 4 CKD and VDI.  The study will be conducted  at 
multiple s ites within the [LOCATION_002] (US).  Approximately [ADDRESS_171748] 2019  OPKO Ireland Global Holdings Ltd.

 enroll approximately 80 eligible subjects who will be randomized 1:1:1:1 (approximately 20 per 
arm, balanced for body weight ) to receive 8 weeks of treatment as follows: CTAP101 Capsules 
at a dose of 60 mcg per day; IR calcifediol at a dose of 266 mcg on Day 1 and Day 29; high -
dose cholecalciferol at a dose of 300,000 IU on Day 1 and Day 29; and paricalcitol at a dose of 
1 mcg per day (possibly increasing to 2 mcg per day at Day 29) plus low -dose cholecalciferol 
800 IU per day.  If a sign ificant difference in average  weight among subjects by [CONTACT_149242], subjects may be placed into specific treatment groups 
rather than randomly assigned, in order to try and achieve more balance in the treatment gr oups 
by [CONTACT_18694].  
The subjects will be housed in a phase 1 unit for approximately 14 to 26 hours at the beginning 
of the study and on study Day 29 to provide the blood samples required for a detailed 
determination of the PK profile s for serum calcifediol (25D 3)  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Blood samples for some of the PK/  assessments will be collected 
in the phase 1 unit at -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours ; either in t he phase 1 unit or  during outpatient 
visit, at 24  hours;  during outpatient visit for 48 hours ; and then weekly following the first dose 
and the Day 29 dose of each medication.   
  Urine collections (24 -hour) will be obtained at pre -
treatment baseline (Visits 2 and 3), starting immediately after dosing on Day 1 (Visit 4) and 
Day 29 (Visit 10) and at the end of study (Visit 16)  or early termination (ET) .  The schedule for 
collection of blood and urine sample s is delineated in Section 7 (Study Activities ) and in 
APPENDIX 1.   
Subjects receiving treatment with calcitriol or another 1α -hydroxylated vitamin D analog , must 
forgo treatment with these non -study agents and complete a 4 -week washout period prior to 
baseline (BL) assessments and will remain off these non -study medications for the duration of 
the study.  For subjects who are taking vitamin D supplementation (including multivitamins and 
fish oil), they must forgo treatment with these non -study agents for t he duration of the study and 
undergo a 4 week washout.  If at the end of the 4 -week washout the serum total 25-
hydroxy vitamin D level is still ≥30 ng/mL, washout may be extended by [CONTACT_149243] a maximum total of [ADDRESS_171749] 
received calcimimetic therapy within 12 weeks preceding screening.   
Blood samples will be collected from all subjects at weekly intervals during the screening and 
BL periods; during the 8 -week treatment period; and at the specified times during the PK/  
assessments.  Key parameters to be analyzed in the collected samples include some or all of the  
following: serum calcifediol,

signs (VS) and adverse events (AEs) will be monitored at each study visit.  Other parameters to 
be monitored less frequently include  
 brief physical examinations (PEs) and clinical laboratory tests 
(hematology and routine clinical chemistries).  
Subjects will maintain a dietary intake during the study of approximately 1,000 -1,500 mg of 
elemental ca lcium per day by [CONTACT_149244], if necessary, a prescribed daily calcium 
supplement.  
Dosing Plan:  
Approximately 80 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 (approximately 20 per arm) to receive 
one of the listed study medications with a sufficient qua ntity of a non -alcoholic beverage to 
enable swallowing of the capsules:  
1) CTAP101 Capsules [ADDRESS_171751].  
2) IR calcifediol [ADDRESS_171752] on the mornings of Day 1 and 
Day 29.  
3) Cholecalciferol 300,000 IU (high -dose)  in the phase [ADDRESS_171753] on the mornings 
of Day 1 and Day 29.  
4) Paricalcitol 1 mcg plus cholecalciferol 800  IU (low -dose) once daily outside of the phase [ADDRESS_171754] provided that (a) the 
plasma iPTH has not decreased by [CONTACT_2669] 30% from pretreatment BL and remains above 70 
pg/mL, (b) corrected serum calcium is <9.8 mg /dL, and (c) serum phosphorus is <5.5 mg/dL.  
Subjects who are receiving CTAP101 Capsules, IR calcifediol or cholecalciferol (300,000 IU) 
will not undergo upward dose titration.  
Subjects will reduce the dose of study medication per the schedule below in t he event that 
plasma iPTH is confirmed to be <30 pg/mL, corrected serum calcium is confirmed to be >10.3 
mg/dL, or serum phosphorus is confirmed to be > 5.5 mg/dL. Subjects will suspend dosing if 
plasma iPTH is confirmed to be <15 pg/mL or corrected serum calcium is confirmed to be 
>11.0 mg/dL, and will resume dosing when plasma iPTH is ≥30 pg/mL and corrected serum 
calcium is <9.8 mg/dL per the dose schedule  below.   
Dose reduction (if needed) : 
CTAP101: decrease to 30 mcg per day (from 60 mcg per day)  
IR calcifediol: hold Day 29 dose  
Cholecalciferol 300,000 IU: hold Day 29 dose  
Paricalcitol: decrease dose to 1 mcg per day (from 2 mcg per day)

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Medications  
1.1.1 CTAP101 Capsules  
CTAP101  Capsules  is an extended -release (ER) oral formulation of calcifediol which OPKO  
Ireland Global Holdings Ltd . (OPKO)  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_25415] a treatment for secondary 
hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT ) in patients  with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney dis ease (CKD) and 
vitamin D insufficiency  (VDI) .  Calcifediol is 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3, the physiological precursor 
to the vitamin D 3 hormone, 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (calcitriol ). 
1.1.2 Calcifediol Capsules  
Calcifediol capsules are available in the US and in certain countries of the European Union (EU) 
in immediate -release (IR) or ER formulations.  H idroferol is an IR oral formulation of calcifediol 
which F aes Farma  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_149210].  H idroferol is on the market in Spain 
and will soon be  marketed in certain other countries of the EU.  Calcifediol is not approved in 
Japan.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_171760] reported the use of daily doses of vitamin D (either cholecalciferol or 
ergocalciferol) of 700 to 4,000 International Units (IU), weekly doses of 5,000 to 50,000 IU, and 
monthly doses of 50,000 to 300,000 IU.   Irrespective of the treatment regimen used, no or 
inadequate reductions in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels have been observed in randomized 
clinical trials and nutritional vitamin D remains unproven as an effective treatment for SHPT in 
patients with st age 3 -4 CKD.  
1.1.4 Paricalcitol Capsules  
Paricalcitol capsules are available in the  US and in the EU as a treatment for SHPT in patients 
with stage 3 or 4 CKD. Paricalcitol is a 1α -hydroxylated vitamin D analog which is active on 
administration and interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the parathyroid gland to 
suppress the synthesis and secretio n of PTH.  Paricalcitol is frequently combined with 
cholecalciferol in order to both correct VDI and suppress elevated PTH in pre -dialysis patients, 
but the safety and efficacy of this combination of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_149211].  
1.2 Metabolism of Calcifediol and Related Metabolites  
Calcifediol is synthesized by [CONTACT_149246] D 3 (cholecalciferol ) generated endogenously 
in skin following exposure to sunlight or obtained from the diet or supplements.  Another 
prohor mone, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 2, is synthesized hepatically from vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol ), 
which cannot be produced endogenously but is obtained only from the diet or supplements.

 These two prohormones are collectively referred to as “25 -hydroxyvitamin D.”  Unless an 
individual is receiving significant ergocalciferol supplementation, essentially all of the 25 -
hydroxyvitamin D in blood consists of calcifediol.  
The two vitamin D prohormones are activated by [CONTACT_149247]27B1, 
located in the proximal kidney tubule [DeLuca 2004].  Activation occurs under tight regulation 
by [CONTACT_149248], which is secreted by [CONTACT_149249].  The prohormones (25-hydroxyvitamin D2 
and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3) are metabolized directly to  1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 2 (ercalcitriol) 
and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (calcitriol), respectively.  These two vitamin D hormones, 
collectively referred to as “1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ”, are secreted by [CONTACT_149250].  
The two vitamin D prohormones are also activated extra -renally by [CONTACT_097]27B1  in parathyroid and 
many other cells [Adams et al 2014] to provide a local supply of hormones that may prove 
critical to cell growth regulation and the preventio n of cancer, autoimmune disorders (such as 
psoriasis) and certain types of infection.  Adequate local hormone production depends entirely on 
sufficient levels of circulating [ADDRESS_171762] indicator of a patient’s 
vitamin D status.  Serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of ≥30 ng/mL are considered 
adequate in CKD patients while levels of <30 ng/mL are considered “insufficient”  [Holick et al 
2011].  The normal reference range for serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 30 to 100 ng/mL 
[Souberbielle et al 2010 ].  Observational studies suggest that in CKD patients, as glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) declines, higher [ADDRESS_171763] parathyroid hormone ( iPTH) targets [Ennis 2016].  Levels of serum total 25-
hydroxyvitamin D in the general population vary according to many factors, in cluding intensity 
of sunlight (varying with geographic location and season), exposure to sunlight (affected by [CONTACT_149251][INVESTIGATOR_371], use of sunscreen and other cultural factors), age and dietary intake [ Holick 1995].  
Levels tend to be lower during the winter and at higher latitudes.  In patients with CKD, low 
serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (VDI) are unrelated to season or latitude and become 
more prevalent as kidney disease advances.  
1.4 Chronic Kidney Disease  
CKD is a steadily-increasing health problem  driven by [CONTACT_149252].  CKD 
is categorized into five stages, each defined by a GFR range that progressively d ecreases from 
stage 1 to 5.  Aberrations in mineral metabolism and bone histology begin early in the course of 
CKD, worsening as GFR declines [ Levin et al 2007].  Even minimal reductions in GFR have 
been linked to increased risk o f bone loss (osteoporosis), and the incidence of hip fracture 
increases as CKD progresses.  Co -morbidities associated with CKD inclu de SHPT, VDI, 
pervasive soft tissue calcification, cardiovascular disease, infections and reduced quality of life 
[Souberbielle et al 2010 ].   
VDI in patients with CKD is driven by [CONTACT_149253], decreased exposure to sunlight, 
proteinuria, including urinary loss of vitamin D binding protein (DBP) , decreased hepatic

 synthesis of calcifediol and excessive expre ssion of the vitamin D catabolic enzyme, CYP24 A1 
[Helvig et al 2010].  Because renal and extra -renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 is 
dependent on an adequate supply of calcifediol, VDI causes inadequate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin 
D3 production.  Declining renal function further impairs the conversion of calcifediol to 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D 3 by [CONTACT_149254] 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1).  Chronically low circulating 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 results in decreased intestinal absorption  of dietary calcium, increased 
secretion of PTH by [CONTACT_149255], ultimately, SHPT.  
1.5 Secondary Hyperparathyroidism  
SHPT is a condition commonly associated with CKD in which the parathyroid glands secrete 
excessive amounts of PTH.  SHPT affects 40% to 82% of patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD  [Levin 
et al 2007] and frequently arises as a result of either VDI or impaired kidney function, both of 
which can prevent sufficient production of vitamin D hormone to properly regulate calcium and 
phosphorus metabolism and PTH secretion.  Impaired kidney function can also cause elevated 
serum phosphorus and fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23) which exacerbate SHPT.  SHPT 
requires prompt and effective treatment, as prolonged elevation of PTH causes excessive calcium 
and phosphorus to be released from bone, leading to metabolic bone disease and calcification of 
cardiovascular and renal tissues.  In the absence o f effective treatment, SHPT becomes 
progressively more severe and unresponsive to treatment [ Nigwekar et al 2014 ].   
1.6 Clinical Practice Guidelines  
Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of metabolic bone disease in CKD recommend 
regular screening for elevated PTH beginning in patients with stage 3 CKD.  The guidelines, 
issued by [CONTACT_149256] 
(K/DOQI) [National Kidney Foundation. KD OQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for Bone 
Metabolism and Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease 2003 , Guideline 8A], the more recent 
Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the 
Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention, and T reatment of Chronic Kidney Disease -Mineral and Bone 
Disorder (CKD-MBD) [Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD -MBD 
Work Group 2009] and the recent update to the KDIGO  guideline [KDIGO 2017 Clinical 
Practice Guideline Update for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention, and Treatment of CKD -
MBD], also recommend tes ting for VDI when elevated PTH is encountered, and correcting with 
aggressive vitamin D supplementation.  
1.7 The Current Unmet Medical Need 
The medical literature documents that low serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D is inconsistently or 
inadequately treated in patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD by [CONTACT_1996] D (ergocalciferol or 
cholecalciferol) supplementation, and that elevated PTH remai ns uncorrected.  More than [ADDRESS_171765] been published since 1973 in which ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol was 
administered to patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD.  The overall conclusion from this body of work 
is summarized by [CONTACT_149257] -Zadeh et al: “Most of these studies have shown either no or minimal 
to inadequate changes in PTH levels, usually only in some stages of CKD, or changes that still 
would not satisfy the K/DOQI recommended target ranges for PTH ” [Kalantar-Zadeh et al 
2009].  A more recent review of the published randomiz ed clinical trials concluded that vitamin 
  
Protocol CTAP101-CL-[ADDRESS_171766] 2019 OPKO Ireland Global Holdings Ltd.

Confidential   
   
   
 D had no efficacy in lowering iPTH levels in patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD [ Agarwal 2016]. 
Hence, there is a need for effective treatment to increase serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 
control elevated iPTH in this patient population.  
1.8 Nonclinical Experience with Study Medications  
1.8.1 CTAP101 Capsules  
To study the toxicity of CTAP101 Capsules, an earlier formulation of CTAP101 Capsules was 
administered to dogs for 3 months and resulted in typi[INVESTIGATOR_26445] D -induced toxicities including 
hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, soft tissue mineralization (e.g., kidn ey, stomach, aorta and heart) 
and death.  Severe adverse reactions to CTAP101 Capsules were observed in dogs treated with 
500 or 1,000 mcg/day and were associated with serum calcifediol levels >450  ng/mL following 1 
month of treatment.  
Using the current formulation of CTAP101 Capsules, dogs were treated daily for three months 
with doses up to 45 µg (~4.5 mcg/kg/day).  No signs of toxicity were observed at the highest 
dose tested which was associated with serum calcifediol levels >150 ng/ mL.   
Calcifediol administration (orally through addition to the diet) to rats for 6 months has been 
reported to produce signs of toxicity at daily doses >40 mcg/kg.  Toxicities included an increased 
incidence of nephrocalcinosis and uroliths.  Oral admini stration of calcifediol to dogs at ≤2 
mcg/kg/day resulted in no compound -related findings. 
Results from in vitro drug release and nonclinical PK studies in male Yucatan swine demonstrate 
that CTAP101 Capsules have an ER profile.  In swine, the bioavailabil ity (BA) of calcifediol 
following the administration of CTAP101 Capsules was approximately 30% lower than that from 
an IR capsule preparation.  Further, a delay in the release of the active ingredient (time of 
maximum concentration or tmax >7 hours) was observed as compared to the IR formulation (tmax 
~4 hours). 
1.8.2 Cholecalciferol, Calcifediol and Paricalcitol 
Toxicity associated with cholecalciferol, calcifediol and paricalcitol is well understood in the 
medical literature.  Generally, such toxicity is subsequent to hypercalcemia.  Hypercalcemia and 
increased calcium loading can cause calcium deposits in kidneys and vasculature, and can cause 
parathyroid atrophy and generalized tissue deposition of calcium.   
Vitamin D-related toxicity is generally chara cterized by: 
 Increases in urine calcium levels; 
 Increases in serum calcium levels; 
 Mineralization of soft tissues, believed to develop subsequent to hypercalcemia ; and, 
 Increases in bone formation with a resulting reduction in bone marrow space . 
1.9 Previous Clinical Experience  with CTAP101 
CTAP101 Capsules (30  mcg) have been approved as Rayaldee® by [CONTACT_48354] (FDA) for the treatment of SHPT in adults with stage [ADDRESS_171767] 2019  OPKO Ireland Global Holdings Ltd.  
CTAP101 Capsules  Page 21 of 86 
 
Confidential    
   
   
 defined as serum total 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels less  than 30 ng/mL.  The clinical studies 
which supported FDA approval are described below.  
There have been three  previous single -dose phase 1 studies with CTAP101 Capsules  (CTAP101 -
CL-1005, CTAP101 -CL-1011  and CTAP101 -CL-1016 ), two phase 2 studies, of which one was a 
single -dose study ( CTAP101 -CL-2004 ) and one was a repeat -dose study ( CTAP101 -CL-2008 ), 
and three phase 3 studies ( CTAP101 -CL-3001, CTAP101 -CL-3002  and CTAP101 -CL-3003 ).  
Studies CTAP101 -CL-1011 , CTAP -CL-1016  and CTAP101 -CL-2008 were conducted wit h the 
current  formulation of CTAP101 Capsules  (30 mcg per capsule) .  Two of the phase 3 studies 
(CTAP101 -CL-3001  and CTAP101 -CL-3002 ) were  identical double -blind, placebo -controlled 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_149212]  (CTAP101 -CL-3003) was a follow -on open-label extension trial .   
The single -dose studies confirmed the ER characteristics of the investigational drug product and 
that the current formulation has a BA of approximately 25%  when administered in the fasting 
state.  Administration of a single  pharmacologic  dose of CTAP101 Capsules  following a high-
fat, high calorie meal resulted in a significantly higher exposure of calcifediol compared to when 
administered in a fasted state.  An approximate 5 -fold increase in maximum serum concentration 
(Cmax) and a 3.5 -fold increase in area under the concentration curve ( AUC ) was observed in the 
fed group compared to the fasted group  (CTAP101 -CL-1016) . 
In CTAP101 -CL-2008, a  double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized repeat -dose study, daily 
administration of  CTAP101 Capsules  increased serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D  levels to ≥30 
ng/mL in nearly  all subjects and decreased mean plasma iPTH from pre-treatment baseline ( BL) 
and compared to placebo during 6 weeks o f treatment.  The mean % decrease in iPTH from BL 
in the per-protocol ( PP) population was related to the administered dose: -20.9, -32.8, and -39.3 
for the 30, 60 and 90 mcg groups, respectively .   
Efficacy was confirmed in the phase 3 program with nearly all subjects (97%)  treated with 
CTAP101  Capsules  who completed the program  without a major protocol deviation , achieving a 
normal serum total 25 -hydroxyvitamin D level and with 50% of such subjects achieving a mean 
reduction in  plasma  iPTH from BL of at least 30%.  Fewer than 9% of placebo subjects achie ved 
a 30% reduction in iPTH or achieved a normal 25 -hydroxyvitamin D level.  
CTAP101 Capsules  did not cause significant adverse effects on serum  calcium or phosphorus.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including those related to the investigational study 
drug, were comparable across treatment groups, except for hyperphosphatemia which was 
observed in four subjects, none of which was considered by [CONTACT_149258] s tudy drug.  
For all clinical st udies, the adverse event (AE) profiles did not identify any events specific to 
CTAP101 Capsules .  After both single and repeat -dose administration, CTAP101 Capsules  were 
generally well -tolerated.   The overall treatment emergent AE profile in the phase 3 pr ogram was 
comparable between CTAP101 Capsules  and placebo groups.  Subjects receiving CTAP101 
Capsules  had a greater increase in  mean  serum calcium (P<0.001) than placebo patients (0.2 
versus 0.1 mg/dL ); for serum phosphorus, subjects receiving CTAP101 Cap sules  had a greater 
mean increase (P<0.05) than placebo patients (0.2 versus 0.1 mg/dL ).

1.12 Previous Clinical Experience with Paricalcitol C apsules 
Oral paricalcitol has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials  to be effective in controlling 
elevated PTH which characterizes SHPT but it frequently causes hypercalcemia in pre -dialysis 
patients.  In the PRIMO trial [ Thadhani 2012], paricalcitol, administered orally at 2 mcg per day, 
lowered mean PTH from a BL level of approximately 130 pg/mL to the normal range within 8 
weeks, and maintained it normal for another 40 weeks of treatment.  No PTH reduction was 
observed in the parallel placebo group.  Mean serum calcium and phosphorus rose with 
paricalcitol treatment by 0.57 mg/dL (P<0.001) and 0.19 mg/dL (P=0.05), respectively, versus 
placebo.  Nearly 23% of subjects experienced hypercalcemia, defined as 2 consecutiv e 
measurements above 10.5 mg/dL, on paricalcitol versus 0.9% on placebo (P<0.001).  In the 
OPERA Trial [Wang 2014], paricalcitol, administered orally at 1 mcg per day, reduced median 
PTH by 86 pg/mL (55%) from a BL level of 156 pg/mL while placebo treatment increased PTH 
by 21 pg/mL (16%) from a BL level of 129 pg/mL.  Mean serum calcium rose with paricalcitol 
treatment but not with placebo, and 43% of subjects on paricalcitol experienced hypercalcemia, 
defined as serum calcium above 10.2 mg/dL, versus 3% on placebo (P<0.001).  In US phase 3 
trials, paricalcitol produced a mean decrease of 45% in PTH after 24 weeks compared with a 
mean increase of 14% with placebo, and raised serum calcium and phosphorus by 0.2 and 0 .1 
mg/dL, respectively [ Coyne 2006].  Hypercalcemia, defined as two consecutive serum calcium 
determinations above 10.5 mg/dL, was observed in 2% of subjects receiving paricalcitol versus 0 
% on placebo. 
As mentioned above, oral paricalcitol is often used in combination with oral cholecalciferol to 
control elevated PTH and correct VDI in patients with stage [ADDRESS_171771] 2019  OPKO Ireland Global Holdings Ltd.

 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Study Objectives  
The objectives of this study are to  assess  the repeated -dose safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic  (PK)  
and  profiles  of CTAP101  Capsules , IR calcifediol , high-dose 
cholecalciferol, and paricalcitol plus low-dose cholecalciferol  in patients with  SHPT , stage  3 or 4 
CKD and VDI . 
2.2 Study Endpoints  
2.2.1 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
The following PK parameters will be calculated using observed and BL -adjusted serum 
calcifediol  concentrations: AUC, Cmax, tmax, steady -state 
concentration ( Css), time to steady -state concentration ( tss), terminal elimination half -life ( t½), 
clearance (CL/F), and volume of distribution (Vd/F), as feasible.   
2.2.3 Primary Safety Endpoints  
Safety and tolerability of each medication will be evaluated in the Safety  population by [CONTACT_2695], 
physical examinations (PEs), vital signs (VS), hematology  and clinical chemistries . 
2.2.4 Secondary Safety Endpoints  
Secondary safety endpoints will include incidence of hypercalcemia and drug -related 
hyperphosphat emia.  The number (n, %) of subjects with hypercalcemia (two consecutiv e visits 
with serum calcium greater than 10.3 mg/dL ) or hyperphosphatemia (two consecutive visits with 
serum phosp horus greater than 5.5 mg/dL ) will be calculated.  
2.2.5 Efficacy Endpoints  
This study is descriptive and no primary or secondary efficacy endpoint s are defined. Descriptive 
analysis and plots for the ITT and PP populations will be created of serum calcifediol,  
 
 
 
 
 
 which will be specified in an accompanying statistical analysis 
plan (SAP).

18 years with stage 3 or 4 CKD and VDI.  The study will be conducted at multiple sites within 
the US .  Approximately 160 subjects will be screened to enroll approximately 80 eligible 
subjects who will be randomized 1:1:1:1 (approximately 20 per arm , balanced for body weight ) 
to receive  the following medications:  
Test Products, Dose, and Mod e of Administration :  
CTAP101 Capsules ( 30 mcg/capsule ), 60 mcg,  by [CONTACT_149259] -release  (IR) (266 mcg /capsule ), 266 mcg,  by [CONTACT_149239] ( 50,000 IU /capsule ), 300,000 IU,  by [CONTACT_149240] (1 mcg /capsu le) plus cholecalciferol ( 800 IU/capsule ), 1 or 2 mcg plus 800 IU, 
by [CONTACT_149260] . 
If a significant difference in average weight among subjects by [CONTACT_149261], subjects may be placed into specific treatment groups rather than 
randomly assigned, in order to try and achieve more balance in the tre atment groups by [CONTACT_149262].   
The subjects will be housed in a phase 1 unit for approximately  14 to 26 hours at the beginning 
of the study and on study Day 29 to provide the blood samples required for a detailed 
determination of the PK profile s for serum  calcifediol and  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Blood 
samples for some of the PK/  assessments will be collected in the phase 1 unit at -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 
and 12 hours either in the phase 1 unit  or during outpatient visit, at 24 hours; during outpatient 
visit for 48 hours; and then weekly following the first dose and the Day 29 dose of each 
medication.  Blood samples for other  assessments will be collected at less frequent intervals.  
Urine co llections (24 -hour) will be obtained at pre -treatment baseline (Visits 2 and 3), starting 
immediately after dosing on Day 1 (Visit 4) and Day 29 (Visit 10) and at the end of study (Visit 
16) or early termination (ET) .  The schedule for blood and urine samp le collections is delineated 
in Section  7 (Study Activities)  and in  APPENDIX 1.

 Subjects receiving treatment with calcitriol or another 1α -hydroxylated vitamin D analog, or if 
serum total 25 -hydroxyvitamin D ≥30 ng/mL when taking vitamin D supplementation  (including 
multivitamins and  fish oil ), will complete a 4 -week washout period prior to BL assessments.  
Subjects will forgo further dosing with these none study medications  for the duration of the 
study.  Subjects receiving calcimimetic therapy within 12 weeks preceding screening will be 
inelig ible for enrollment.   
Blood samples will be collected from all subjects at weekly  intervals during the screening and 
BL periods,  during the 8-week treatment period, and at the specified times during the PK/  
assessment.  Key parameters to be analyzed in the collected samples include some or all of the 
following:  serum calcifediol,  
 
 
  VS and 
AEs will be monito red at each study visit.  Other parameters to be monitored less frequently 
inclu de  brief PEs  and 
clinical laboratory tests (hematology and routine clinical chemistries).  
Subjects wil l maintain a dietary intake during the study of approximately 1, 000-1,500 mg of 
elemental calcium per day with dietary counseling and, as necessary, administratio n of a daily 
calcium supplement . 
3.2 Rationale for Study Design  
OPKO is developi[INVESTIGATOR_149213]101 Capsules  for the treatment of SHPT in patients with stage 3 or 4 
CKD and VDI.  The active ingredient in CTAP101 Capsules  is calcifediol, which is formulated 
as ER capsules for oral administration.  The formulation is designed to raise serum total 25-
hydrox yvitamin D  in a gradual (physiological) manner.  Raising blood levels of 25-
hydroxyvitamin D  too rapi[INVESTIGATOR_149214] a surge in 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D  production which 
increases the expression of CYP24 A1 in both the kidney and in peripheral target tissues an d has 
significant adverse effects on the expression of other key factors associated with bone and 
mineral metabolism, including FGF23, CYP27B 1, iPTH,  calcium and phosphorus  [Petkovich et 
al 2015 ]. 
The principal aims of the pres ent study are  to compare the  safety and efficacy of CTAP101 
Capsules , IR calcifediol, high-dose cholecalciferol, and paricalcitol plus low-dose cholecalciferol 
for up to 8 weeks to treat SHPT in subjects aged 18 years or older with stage 3 or 4  CKD  and 
VDI and to better  characterize the repeated -dose PK profile s for serum calcifediol  
 
 
.   
The starting dose of CTAP101 Capsules of  30 mcg/day is the lowest dose approved for 
marketing in the US.  This dose is based  on the results from prior  repeat -dose, placebo -

 controlled, double -blind stud ies with CTAP101 Capsules  in patients with VDI and stage 3 -4 
CKD.  These studies demonstrated that 30 mcg/day of CTAP101 Capsules  safely and effectively 
decreased mean plasma iPTH by [CONTACT_149263] 
25-hydroxyvitamin D  within the currently accepted target range of 30 -100 ng/mL .   
A phase 2b dose ranging study in which CTAP101 Capsules  were administered at daily doses of 
30, 60 and 90 mcg (or 210, 420 and 630 mcg/week) for six weeks showed that mean plasma 
iPTH decreased  from pre-treatment BL in a dose -proportional manner by 20.9, 32.8 and 39.3%, 
respectively, and that s erum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D  rose to levels ≥30 ng/mL in almost all 
subjects  (CTAP101 -CL-2008 ).  The daily dose s of 30 and 60 mcg increased serum 25 -
hydroxyvitamin D to a mean levels of 37 and 67 ng/mL,  respectively,  well within the range of 30 
to 10 0 ng/mL.  The daily dose of 90 mc g raised mean serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D a t EOT to 85 
ng/mL causing levels to exceed 100 ng/mL in a substantial proportion of subjects.  This dose was 
considered too high for further evaluation in the phase [ADDRESS_171775] on mean serum  calcium or phosphorus  or on any other monitored parameters during the 6 -
week treatment period.   PK analyses determined that the terminal elimination half-life t1/2 after 
repeat dosing was approximately 30 days but that steady state was not yet achieved after 6 weeks 
of treatment .  Steady state was determined in phase 3 studies to be attained after 12 weeks of 
treatment  (CTAP101 -CL-3001  and CTAP101 -CL-3002 ).

 4) Paricalcitol 1 mcg plus cholecalciferol 800 IU (low -dose) once daily outside of the phase [ADDRESS_171791] provided that (a) the 
plasma iPTH has not decreased by [CONTACT_2669] 30% from pretreatment BL and remains above 70 
pg/mL, (b) corrected serum calcium is <9.8 mg/dL, and (c) serum phosphorus is <5.5 mg/dL.  
Subjects who are receiving CTAP101 Capsules, IR calcife diol or cholecalciferol (300,000 IU) 
will not undergo upward dose titration.  
5.3 Dose Reduction Criteria  
Subjects will reduce the dose of medication at any time by [CONTACT_149264] <30 pg/mL, corrected serum calcium is confirmed to be >10.3 
mg/dL, or serum phosphorus is confirmed to be > 5.5 mg/dL.  Subjects will suspend dosing if 
plasma iPTH is confirmed to be <15 pg/mL or corrected serum calcium is confirmed to be >11.0 
mg/dL, and will resume when plasma iPTH  is ≥30 pg/mL and corrected serum calcium is <9.8

dosing and resume w hen iPTH is ≥30 pg/mL and corrected serum calcium is <9.8 mg/dL at the 
same minimum dosage.   
Dose resumption:  
CTAP101: 30 mcg per day 
Paricalcitol : [ADDRESS_171793] identification number (SSS NNNN ) will consist of a 
3-digit site number (SSS) and a [ADDRESS_171794] number ( NNNN ) at the applicable clinical 
site.  Should a subject be withdrawn from the study, that subject’s 7 digit identification number 
will not be reassigned.    
Randomization will be accomplished in blocks of 4 subjects in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_171795] is deemed eligible for enrollment based, in part, on labora tory assessments 
obtained at the preceding visit (Visit 1).   Laboratory assessments obtained at Visits 2 -3 will not 
be considered in the determination of enrollment eligibility.  
In the event that a significant difference in me an baseline body weight among subjects by 
[CONTACT_149265], the randomization scheme (described 
immediately above) will be suspended and subjects will be assigned to a specific treatment group 
using the following alternative procedure:  
Step 1:   Calculate  the mean body weight for subjects who have been previously entered into the 
treatment period, in aggregate and by [CONTACT_1570].  
Step 2:  Compare the subject’s body weight (measured at Visit 1) with the current mean body 
weight of all subjects who have p reviously been entered into the treatment period.   If the 
subject’s weight is equal to or higher than the current mean body weight of all previously treated 
subjects, then assign the subject to a treatment group (which still has less than 20 subjects) 
having the lowest mean body weight.   If the subject’s weight is lower than the current mean body 
weight of all previously treated subjects, then assign the subject to a treatment group (which still 
has less than 20 subjects) having the highest mean body weight . 
Step 3 (if needed):   If a subject cannot be assigned to a treatment group according to Step 2 
(above) and there are fewer than [ADDRESS_171796] to a 
treatment group (which still has less than 20 subjects) with th e most similar mean body weight.

 Cytochrome P450 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir,  
itraconazole, nefa zodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin or voriconazole, may 
inhibit enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism (CYP24A1 and CYP27B1), and may alter 
serum levels of calcifediol.  
Cholestyramine has been reported to reduce intestinal absorpti on of fat -soluble vitamins and may 
impair the absorption of calcifediol, the active ingredient in CTAP101 Capsules.  Phenobarbital 
or other anticonvulsants or other compounds that stimulate microsomal  hydroxylation reduce the 
half-life of calcifediol.  
5.5.1 Phosphate Binder and Elemental Calcium Therapy  
Use of phosphate binders is prohibited throughout the study. Elemental calcium may be 
prescribed during the screening visit to ensure the dietary intake is within the range of 1,000 -
1,500  mg per day. The overall  dose of elemental calcium intake should remain stable throughout 
the study.  
5.5.2 Diet Restrictions  
There are no study specific dietary restrictions.  Subjects should follow their dietary plan if one 
has been prescribed.  Changes in prescribed dietary phosphoru s or calcium therapy are 
discouraged and any changes during the study should be captured in the electronic case report 
form ( eCRF ). 
Subjects will maintain a dietary intake during the study of approximately 1, 000-1,[ADDRESS_171799] Activity Restrictions  
Subjects should maintain their usual pattern of sun exposures and activities.  
5.6 Treatment Compliance  
Study t reatment compliance will be assessed at all specified visits .  The Investigator  or assigned  
designee will perform drug accountability and dosing compliance calculations for all study drugs 
(number of capsules that should have been taken versus actual number taken as evidenced by 
[CONTACT_149266], subject  dosing diaries , and the  number of capsules remaining in bottles of 
study drug assigned to each subject ).  Dosing compliance at <80% or >120% should be reported 
as a protocol deviation.

protection and in accordance to USP C ontrolled Room Temperature  (20-25°C or 68 -77°F) and 
with access granted to authorized personnel only.  
All sites must ensure that  study drug ha s been kept under required conditions prior to dispensing.  
A temperature log recording the daily storage temperatures will be maintained at  each site.  
Accountability for all study drug s, from receipt until final reconciliation and return of drug by 
[CONTACT_149267], will be the responsibility of the Investigator  or the assigned designee(s).  
In the case of temperature excursions, produ cts should not be dispensed and the Investigator  or 
the assigned designee(s) should contact [CONTACT_149268].  
The Investigator  or assigned designee(s) will maintain study  drug accountability records 
throughout the course of the study.  Specifically, the Investigator  or assigned designee will 
confirm that supplies are received intact  and in the correct amounts per the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_59309], and 
verify that the supplies were mainta ined within an appropriate temperature range  during 
shipment .  This will be documented by [CONTACT_149269][INVESTIGATOR_149219] a 
copy to the sponsor or designee.  A study drug accountability and dispensing log will record the 
study drug disp osition, including dates, quantity of drug received  by [CONTACT_3725] , to whom and amount 
dispensed \returned  and accounts of any drug accidentally destroyed , or not returned, or lost .  The 
site's overall  inventory of study drug supplies will be verified routinely th roughout the course of 
the study.  All opened and unopened bottle s of study drug  capsules  are to be retained at the site 
until the sponsor  or designee has performed a complete accountability , following which study 
drug will be returned to the sponsor  or designee.  
5.[ADDRESS_171801] Retention at Study Site  
At the conclusion of the study, a final accountability  will be performed by [CONTACT_737]  (or 
designee) and verified by [CONTACT_11200].  Any discrepancies identified will be indicated, wit h 
a specific explanation of each discrepancy.  The Investigator  (or designee) must return all unused 
medication in accordance with the  sponsor’s instructions, and a copy of the clinical supplies 
return documentation will be returned to the sponsor  or desig nee.  Drug accountability records, 
clinical drug supply receipts, and return  records  must be maintained by [CONTACT_737] . 
  
Protocol CTAP101-CL-[ADDRESS_171802] or their legally 
authorized representative ( LAR) will be permitted time and opportunity to inquire about details 
of the study and to decide whether or not to participate.  The subject or their LAR will receive a 
copy of the signed and dated consent form and any wri tten information provided to the study 
subjects.  If any material change occurs that affects the conduct of the study  or the subject’s 
willingness to participate in the study , the subject or LAR will be required to sign an updated 
ICF. 
The Investigator or his/her designee will explain the nature of all aspects of the study to the 
subject and/or their LAR, and answer all questions regarding this study, prior to obtaining 
informed consent. 
The process for obtaining consent will be in accordance with all appli cable regulatory 
requirements.  The subject or his/her LAR and the Investigator or his/her designee must both 
sign and date the ICF before the subject can participate in the study.  The original ICF will be 
retained in the site study records.  The Investigator or his/her designee will ensure documentation 
of the consent discussion in the subject’s medical record/source document.  The decision by [CONTACT_149270].  The Investigator or designee must 
emphasize to the subject that consent regarding study participation may be withdrawn at any 
time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.  
If the ICF or patient information is amended during the study, the Investigator must follow all 
applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to approval of the amended ICF by [CONTACT_5030] /Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) and use of the amended form (including 
for ongoing subjects).

participation in the study ends.  
Information to be collected includes description  of the even t (event term) , date of onset, date of 
resolution, Investigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship to the investigational 
study drug, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or evaluations and outcome.  
AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent 
medications, or progression of disease states must be documented as AEs.  Pre -existing 
conditions (present before the start of the AE collection period) are  considered concurrent 
medical conditions and should NOT be recorded as AEs, but must be documented in the medical 
history section of the eCRF and in the source document.  However, if the subject experiences a 
clinically significant worsening or complicati on of such a concurrent condition, the worsening or 
complication should be recorded as an AE.  Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condition.  
Each AE should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis.  Accompan ying signs (inclu ding 
abnormal laboratory values ) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as additional AEs.  If a 
diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded as an AE(s).  Changes  in 
laboratory values are only considered to be AEs if they ar e judged to be clinically significant (ie, 
if some action or intervention is required or if the Investigator  judges the change to be beyond 
the range of normal physiological fluctuation).  If abnormal laboratory values  are the result of 
pathology for which  there is an overall diagnosis (e .g., increased liver enzymes in hepatitis), the 
diagnosis only should be reported as an AE.  
Pre-planned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to the start of AE 
collection are not considered AEs.  Ho wever, if a pre -planned procedure is performed early (e.g.,  
as an emergency) due to a worsening of the preexisting condition, the worsening of the condition 
should be captured as an AE.  Elective procedures performed where there is no change in the 
subject ’s medical condition (including thought processes around the reason for the elective 
procedure) should not be recorded as AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
document and captured in the source documentation and eCRF as procedures.  
Any report of pregnancy identified for any female subject or for a female partner of a male 
subject should be reported immediately (within 24 hours of being informed) to the medical 
monitor.  Pregnancies will be considered ‘events of special interest’ and will not be captured as 
serious adverse events (SAEs).  The Pregnancy Report F orm will be utilized to obtain BL and 
follow -up information.  Pregnancies will be followed to termination or six weeks post -delivery

It should be noted that the clinical severity and seriousness of an AE are not synonymous, e .g., a 
severe headache is not classified as serious until it meets the required elements as an SAE.  
The maximum severity attained for each AE reported will be recorded in the source 
documentation and in the appropriate eCRFs.   
6.6.5 Relationship 
The Investigator’s assessment of an AE's relationship to the investigational study drug is not a 
factor in determining whether the AE is reported in the source documentation and the appropriate 
section of the eCRF.  If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event 
should be reported.  
The relationship or association of the study drugs in causing or contributing to the AE will be 
characterized by [CONTACT_149274] 3.

 Table 3  Adverse Event Relationship Criteria  
Relationship  Criteria  
Not related   The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the 
investigational product is not reasonable.  
 Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations.  
 Dechallenge (if performed) is negative or ambiguous.  
Unlikely related   The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the 
investigati onal product is reasonable.  
 Could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699].  
 Dechallenge (if performed) is positive or uncertain.  
 Rechallenge is negative.  
Possibly related   The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the 
investigational is reasonable.  
 Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs.  
 Dechallenge (if performed) is positive.  
Related   The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the 
investigational product is reasonable.  
 Cannot be ex plained by [CONTACT_19699].  
 Dechallenge (if performed) is positive and pharmacologically/ 
pathologically plausible.  
 Rechallenge (if feasible) is positive.  
 The AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the 
investigational product or pr oduct class, i.e., pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically recognized/plausible or an objective and specific 
medical disorder.  
  
6.6.6 Clinical Significance  
Changes in laboratory values and vital signs  are only considered to be AEs if they are judged to 
be clinically significant (ie, if some intervention or therapy is required or if the Investigator  
judges the change to be beyond the expected variation).  Any changes or abnormalities will be 
considered clinically significant unless the Investigator  indicates not clinically significant 
directly on the laboratory paperwork , eCRF  or source documentation . 
6.6.7 Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition  
An SAE is defined by [CONTACT_149275]:  
 Death  
 Life-threatening AE

  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 A persistent or significant disability (substantial disrupti on of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions)/incapacity  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, may be life threatening, or may require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon approp riate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.    
Research subjects will be instructed to notify the research center for any emergent condi tion and 
will be given the emergency contact [CONTACT_149276].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expectedness  
SAEs must be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or unexpected, meaning not 
anticipated based on current knowledge about the invest igational compound found in the 
protocol or Investigator Brochure (IB) for CTAP101 Capsules , IR calcifediol, Cholecalciferol, or 
Paricalcitol .  Categories are:  
 Unexpected  - nature or severity of the event is not consistent with the product information ; 
 Expected - event is known based on the product information.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE considered serious (see Section 6.6.7  Serious Adverse Events ) by [CONTACT_149277] [ADDRESS_171813] learn about the event.  
SAE Fax line:   
SAE email:  safety @safeharborpv.com  
A written report will follow as soon as possible and should consist of the SAE report and other 
necessary source documents.  If the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149223], then the Investigator  should attempt to obtain a copy of t he hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149224], and provide them to the sponsor  or designee 
as soon as possible.  
For any information not available at the time of the first report that becomes available later, the 
Investiga tor should add this information to both the source documentation and the initial SAE 
section of the eCRFs , and provide any additional written documentation to the above number 
immediately or within [ADDRESS_171814] 2019  OPKO Ireland Global Holdings Ltd.

 SAEs will be provi ded to the Investigator s by [CONTACT_149278] /EC. 
If using a local IRB /EC, the Investigator  is responsible for informing his or her IRB /EC per its 
requirements of any SAEs at that site.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_149225] /EC, 
regulatory authorities, and other physicians must be provided to the sponsor’s  Clinical Services 
Department.  
A subject experiencing one or more SAEs will receive treatment and follow -up evaluations by 
[CONTACT_737] , or they will be referred to another appropriate physician for treatment and 
follow -up.  Withdrawal from the study and all therapeutic measures will be at the discretion of 
the Investigator  at the site.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolution or should the e vent become indistinguishable from the 
chronic disease condition, the subject will be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_171815] concomitant medication history in the source 
document and eCRF.  Changes in phosphate binder and  calcium supplement th erapy will be 
collected  on a separate page  in the eCRFs.  
6.8 Removal of Subjects from the Study  or Study Drug  (Early Termination)  
The Investigator  may withdraw a subject from the study for any of the following reasons:  
 A major protocol deviation occurs ; 
 A serious or intolerable AE occurs ; 
 A clinically significant change in a laboratory parameter occurs ; 
 The sponsor or Investigator  terminates the study ; 
 The subject requests to be discontinued from the study ; 
 If the Investigator  believes it is no longer in the best interests of the subject to continue ; 
 A subject becomes pregnant ; 
No subject replacement is planned.

 8 QUALITY CONTROL AND A SSURANCE  
A quality assurance audit may be performed by [CONTACT_23638]/or its designee at selected sites 
to verify that the study is conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH/GCP (International 
Council on Harmonisation [ICH] and Good Clinical Practice [GCP ]), and applicable SOP s and 
regulations, to ensure that the sa fety and welfare of subjects are addressed, and to confirm that 
problems reported by [CONTACT_149279].  Verification of study documents and 
activities (if applicable) will be conducted to confirm accuracy of recorded data and its analysis.  
Audi t observations and findings will be documented and communicated to appropriate study 
personnel and management.  An inspection may be conducted by [CONTACT_12721].  The 
Investigator  must allow direct access to study documents during these inspections  and audits.  
Monitoring visits will be performed to evaluate study conduct, data integrity, protocol, and GCP 
compliance.  Each Investigator  is responsible for the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported.  All source docume nts are to be completed in a neat, legible 
manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.   Source documents and laboratory reports will 
be reviewed to ensure that they are accurate and complete.  
To ensure the quality of the clinical data across all subj ects and sites, a Clinical Data 
Management review will be performed by [CONTACT_149280] ( EDC ) system.  During the review, subject data will be 
checked for consistency, omissions,  and any apparent discrepancies.  In addition, the data will be 
reviewed for adherence to the protocol, and ICH/GCP.   Moreover, all data from external sources, 
e.g., central laboratory and PK/ processing/analysis will be reconciled with subject eCRF 
data.  To resolve any questions arising from the Data Management review process, data queries 
and/or data clarification notifications will be generated via the EDC system for completion and 
resolu tion.

the coefficient of variation (in percent, %CV) will be calculated as 100* (SD/[arithmetic mean]).  
Arithmetic means, SDs, medians, and geometric means will  be reported with the same number of

selection of a BL value, the more recent non -missing result will be selected; for post -dose 
measurements, the earliest of the results will be selected.  If multiple laboratory results are 
available for the same date and time and the discrepancy could not be resolved, then the 
arithmetic mean of the results could be used unless specified in the data management plan or data 
handling conventions finalized before database lock .  All subjects entered into the clinical 
database will be included in subject data listings.

study, that subject’s 7 digit identificati on number will not be reassigned.    
Randomization will be accomplished in blocks of 4 subjects in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_171838] is deemed eligible for enrollment based, in part, on labora tory assessments 
obtained at two  preceding visit s (Visit s 1 and 2 ).  Laborator y assessments obtained at Visit 3 will

groups become unbalanced for mean baseline body weight as enrollment progresses, the 
randomization scheme (described immediately above) will be suspended and  subjects will be 
assigned to treatment groups by [CONTACT_149282]:

 Step 1:   Calculate the mean body weight for subjects who have been previously entered into the 
treatment period, in aggregate and by [CONTACT_1570].  
Step 2:  Compare the  subject’s body weight (measured at Visit 1) with the current mean body 
weight of all subjects who have previously been entered into the treatment period.   If the 
subject’s weight is equal to or higher than the current mean body weight of all previously tr eated 
subjects, then assign the subject to a treatment group (which still has less than 20 subjects) 
having the lowest mean body weight.   If the subject’s weight is lower than the current mean body 
weight of all previously treated subjects, then assign the  subject to a treatment group (which still 
has less than 20 subjects) having the highest mean body weight.  
Step 3  (if needed):   If a subject cannot be assigned to a treatment group according to Step 2

 Medical history will be displayed in a data listing.  Date of diagnoses of CKD and SHPT, stage 
of CKD, underlying diagnosis of the CKD, and previous and concurrent diseases will be 
collected in the eCRF and documented on the history of CKD page or as medical history.  
Medical history events will be sorted alp habetically by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC).  The coding 
of the data will be  performed with MedDRA version 20 .0 or higher , using preferred t erms . 
9.7 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior medications are defined as any continuing or new medication used within 12 weeks  and 
discontinued before Visit  1.  Concomitant medications are defined as any continuing or new 
medication taken from Visit  1 or anytime thereafter until the end of the study.  World Health 
Organization Drug  Dictionary Enhanced version  September  2017, Format C, or later will be used 
to code concomitant and prior medications.  Prior and concomitant medications will be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_149283]/therapeutic/chemical Class Level 2 and 4 and  generic drug name.  All medications 
recorded on the eCRF, including start and stop (or ongoing as of) dates, AE number (if 
applicable), indication, dose, unit, route, and frequency will be listed.  For the purpose of 
inclusion in prior or concomitant medi cation tables, incomplete medication start and stop dates 
will be imputed and then categorized into prior or concomitant medication categories.

All AEs will be collected on the eCRF and coded via SOC and preferred term using MedDRA 
version 20.0 or higher.   Additionally , the intensity of all AEs will be co ded using CTCAE v. 5.0.  
AEs with missing onset date will be treated as TEAEs and missing onset date will be imputed as 
the date of Visit  1, unless the event end date indicates that the event resolved prior to Visit  1, in 
which case it will be documented i n medical history.  AEs with partial onset date will be treated 
as TEAEs unless the partial onset date or end date of the event is complete enough to indicate 
that the event started or resolved prior to the administration of the investigational study drug,  in 
which case it will be documented in medical history.  Detailed information collected for each 
TEAE will include: AE number, a description of the event, start date, end date or ongoing as of 
date, outcome, therapy for event, whether the AE is serious, s eriousness criteria (life -threatening, 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, required intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment/damage), severity, and relationship to  the study drug.  The incidence of the AEs will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_149285], potentially drug -related TEAEs, serious 
TEAEs, discontinuation due to TEAEs, TEAEs by [CONTACT_8792]  (definite, probable, 
possible, unrelated) a nd TEAEs by [CONTACT_926] (mild, moderate, severe).  The number and 
percentages of subjects with a TEAE will be summarized by [CONTACT_149286] .  TEAEs will be sorted in descending order of total 
incidence o f SOC and preferred term within each SOC.  The percentages will be based on the 
number of Safety  subjects in a particular population subgroup .  If a subject has more than one 
TEAE that code to the same preferred term, the subject will be counted only once for that 
preferred term.  Similarly, if a subject has more than one TEAE within a SOC category, the 
subject will be counted only once in that SOC category.  All AEs collected on the eCRF will be

source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation 
of data.  
Data capture and management will be consistent with applicable ICH/GCP guidelines.  
All data collected during the study for subjects who are enrolled will be recorded in an 
individual, subject -specific eCRF  as part of an EDC system.  The sponsor or designee will 
provide training to the investigative site on the EDC system and eCRFs.   All eCRFs will be 
completed in a timely manner  as data are available in the source for each subject.  As EDC  will 
be utilized, instructions, training records, and a log will be maintained to identify the designated 
site personnel who can enter data and/or sign off on an eCRF.  
A subject eCRF must be completed for each subject w ho signs a consent form and is 
randomized .  All data generated from external sources, (e.g.,  central laboratory results ), will be 
integrated with the subject eCRF data through programming or other data integration techniques.  
All eCRFs should be completed within [ADDRESS_171852]’s status throughout the course of the study in real time.   Queries also should 
be resolved in a timely manner.  
The Investigator  will sign and date the indicated places on  the eCRF via the EDC system’s 
electronic signature.  These signatures will indicate that the Investigator  reviewed the data on the 
eCRF, the data queries, and the data clarifications and agrees with the content.

 APPENDIX  2  CALCIFEDIOL IR  CAPSULES  (HIDROFEROL ) 
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS  
(Translation)  
1.  NAME [CONTACT_149314] 0.266  mg soft capsules  
2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  
Each capsule contains 0.266  mg (266  micrograms) of cal cifediol (15,960  IU of vitamin  D). 
Excipi[INVESTIGATOR_149227]:  
Each capsule contains 4.98  mg of ethanol, 31.302  mg of sorbitol (70% v/v) (E­420), 0.958  mg of 
sunset yellow (E­110) and other excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
For the full list of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], see section  6.1. 
3.  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  
Soft capsule  
Soft gelatine orange -coloured capsule.  
4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
In adults:  
Treatment of vitamin  D deficiency in cases in which the initial administration of high doses is 
required or where adm inistration spaced out over time may be preferred, as in the following 
situations:  
 As an adjuvant for treating osteoporosis;  
 In patients with malabsorption syndrome  
 Renal osteodystrophy  
 Bone problems caused by [CONTACT_149294].  
4.[ADDRESS_171862] be 
taken into account when calculating the appropriate dose of vitamin  D analogues, such as 
calcifediol.  
The dose, frequency and  duration of treatment will be determined according to the plasma levels 
of 25­OH -cholecalciferol, the type and situation of the patient and other comorbidities such as 
obesity, malabsorption syndrome and corticosteroid treatment. The dose which generates serum 
calcium levels of between 9 –10 mg/dL should be administered.  
The plasma determination of 25­OH -cholecalciferol is considered the most acceptable way of 
diagnosing vitamin  D deficiency. It can be accepted that there is vitamin D deficiency with serum 
levels of 25­OH -cholecalciferol <  20 ng/mL and vitamin  D insufficiency with serum levels of 
25­OH -cholecalciferol between 20 and 24  ng/mL.  
In normal subjects, the mean serum concentrations range between 25 and 40  ng/mL of 25­OH -
cholecalciferol.  
The recommended dose is one capsule (0.266  mg of calcifediol) once a month.

  Vitamin D insufficiency: The administration of one capsule (0.266  mg of calcifediol) a month 
for 2  months is recommended.  
 Vitamin D deficiency: The initial administration of one capsul e (0.266  mg of calcifediol) a 
month for 4  months is recommended.  
 As an adjuvant in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients with vitamin  D deficiency, the 
administration of one capsule (0.266  mg of calcifediol) a month for 3 –4 months is 
recommended.  
There  are populations at high risk of vitamin  D deficiency in whom it may be necessary to 
administer higher doses or more prolonged regimens, after analytically testing the extent of the 
deficiency and completing regular checks of serum levels of 25­OH -cholecal ciferol.  
 Renal osteodystrophy: Taking one capsule (0.266  mg of calcifediol) per week or every two 
weeks is recommended.  
 Bone problems caused by [CONTACT_13216]: Taking one capsule (0.266  mg of calcifediol) a 
month is recommended.  
 In patients with higher vi tamin  D deficiencies or malabsorption syndrome, repeating the 
initial dose weekly (0.266  mg of calcifediol) is recommended, followed by [CONTACT_149295] 
a month for 4  months, checking the plasma concentration of 25­OH -cholecalciferol. 
Depending on these le vels, an increase in the dose or frequency of administration may be 
required. Once the value within the interval has been established, the treatment will be 
suspended or the regimen will be more spaced out.  
In general, the doses must be reduced when sympto ms improve because the requirements for 
vitamin D analogues normally decrease after recovery of the bone.  
It is useful to know the serum concentrations of 25­OH -cholecalciferol 3  months after starting the 
supplementation to confirm that they are within the  desirable or preferred interval (30 –60 ng/mL). 
Once the value within the interval has been established, the treatment will be suspended or the 
regimen will be more spaced out.  
Paediatric population  
The medicinal product Hidroferol 0.1  mg/mL oral drops in solution has been authorised for use in 
children, with lower dose concentration.  
Method of administration  
Oral route.  
The capsule may be taken with water, milk or juice.  
4.3  Contraindications  
 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_149228]  6.1. 
 Hypercalcaemia (calcaemia >  10.5 mg/dL), hypercalciuria (abnormally high excretion of 
calcium in the urine).  
 Calcium lithiasis.  
 Hypervitaminosis D.  
4.4  Special w arnings and precautions for use  
 The serum levels of 25­OH -cholecalciferol reflect the patient’s vitamin  D status, but in order 
to obtain an adequate clinical response to the oral administration of calcifediol, there must 
also be adequate calcium intake in the diet. Therefore, to control the therapeutic effects, in 
addition to the 25­OH -cholecalciferol, the calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase, and 
urinary calcium and phosphorous in the serum must be monitored over 24  hours; a drop in the 
  
Protocol CTAP101 -CL-[ADDRESS_171864] be taken, in particular the serum level s of 
25­OH -calciferol and calcium.  
 Hepatic or gallbladder insufficiency:  In the event of hepatic insufficiency, an inability to 
absorb calcifediol may oc cur through bile salts not being produced.  
 Renal insufficiency:  Administration with caution is advised. The use of this medicinal 
product in patients with chronic kidney disease must be accompanied by [CONTACT_149296], and to prevent hypercalcaemia. As the kidneys will give 
rise to calc itriol, in the event of severe renal insufficiency (renal creatinine clearance less than 
30 mL/minute) a very significant decrease in the pharmacological effects may occur.  
 Cardiac insufficiency:  Particular caution is required. The individual’s calcium lev el must be 
monitored at all times, particularly in patients undergoing treatment with digitalis medication, 
as it may cause hypercalcaemia and the appearance of arrhythmia; it is advised to perform 
these measurements twice a week at the start of treatment.  
 Hypoparathyroidism:  1­alpha -hydroxylase shall be activated by [CONTACT_941] , 
therefore in the event of parathyroid insufficiency, the calcifediol activity may decrease.  
 Renal calculi:  The calcium level must be controlled as vitamin  D, by [CONTACT_149297], may aggravate the symptoms. Vitamin  D levels must only be administered in 
these patients if the benefits outweigh the risks.  
 In patients with long -term immobilisation, dose reduction may be necessary on occasion to 
avoid hypercalcae mia. 
 There are diseases that affect the intestine’s capacity to absorb vitamin  D, as in the case of 
malabsorption syndrome or Crohn’s disease.  
 Patients with sarcoidosis, tuberculosis or other granulomatous diseases: It must be used with 
caution, given that  in these diseases there is greater sensitivity to the effect of vitamin  D and 
increase the risk of suffering from adverse reactions at lower doses  of the medicinal product 
than the recommended ones. The serum and urinary calcium concentrations should be 
checked in these patients.  
 The patient and their family and/or carers must be informed of the importance of complying 
with the indicated posology and the recommendations regarding diet and taking calcium 
supplements concomitantly in order to prevent overdos e. 
 Interference with laboratory tests:  Patients must be advised that this medicinal product 
contains a component that may cause changes in laboratory test results:  
Measurement of cholesterol: Calcifediol may interfere with the Zlatkis -Zak method, giving ri se to 
false increases in serum cholesterol levels.  
Elderly patients:  
Elderly patients generally have a greater need for vitamin  D due to a decrease in the capacity of 
the skin to produce cholecalciferol from its precursor 7­dehydrocholesterol, due to a reduction in 
exposure to sunlight, and due to changes in renal function or digestive dysfunctions that may 
reduce vitamin  D absorption.

It may cause asthma, especially in patients who are allergic to acetylsalicylic acid.  
4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone  and other enzyme inducers: Enzyme inducers can 
reduce the plasma concentratio ns of calcifediol and inhibit their effects through induction of 
their hepatic metabolism.  
 Cardiac glycosides:  Calcifediol may cause hypercalcaemia, which can in turn strengthen the 
inotropic effects of digoxin and its toxicity, causing cardiac arrhythmia.  
 Medicinal products that reduce the absorption of calcifediol, such as cholestyramine, 
colestipol or orlistat,  may cause a decrease of the effects. Spacing out the doses of these 
medicinal products and vitamin  D supplements by [CONTACT_2669] 2  hours is recommend ed. 
 Paraffin and mineral oil:  Due to the liposolubility of calcifediol, it can be dissolved in 
paraffin and decrease its intestinal absorption. The use of another type of laxative or at least 
spacing out the doses is recommended.  
 Thiazide diuretics:  Concom itant administration of a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) 
with vitamin  D supplements, in patients with hypoparathyroidism can give rise to 
hypercalcaemia, which can be temporary or require suspension of treatment with the 
vitamin  D analogue.  
 Some a ntibiotics, such as penicillin, neomycin and chloramphenicol , can increase calcium 
absorption.  
 Phosphate binders such as magnesium salts:  As vitamin  D has an effect on the transport of 
phosphate in the intestine, kidneys and bones, it may cause hypermagnesaemia; the dose of 
phosphate binders must be adjusted in accordance with serum phosphate concentrations.  
 Verapamil:  There are studies in which possible inhibition of anti -angina action has been 
recorded, through antagonism of its actions.  
 Vitamin  D: The concomitant administration of any vitamin  D analogue must be avoided as 
this may cause additive positive effects and hypercalcaemia.  
 Calciu m supplements:  The uncontrolled intake of additional preparations containing 
calcium must be avoided.  
 Corticosteroids:  counteract the effects of vitamin  D analogues, such as calcifediol.  
Interaction with food and drink  
Foods that can be supplemented with v itamin  D must be taken into account as this may cause 
additive effects.

4.8  Undesirable effects  
The undesirable effects of calcifediol are, generally, rare (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) although 
sometimes they are moderately significant.  
The most significant undesirable effects relate to the excessive intake of vitamin  D, which means 
they are usually associated with overdose or prolonged treatments, in particular when it is 
combined with high doses of calcium. Doses of vitamin  D analogues required to produce 
hypervitaminosis vary considerably between individuals. The most typi[INVESTIGATOR_149230], and they can appear at an early or a late stage.  
Endocrine disorders:  
Pancreatitis, among the delayed sympt oms of hypercalcaemia.  
Metabolism and nutrition disorders:  
Increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), albuminuria, hypercholesterolaemia, hypercalcaemia  
Nervous system disorders:  
If moderate hypercalcaemia has occurred, the following may appear: weakness, fati gue, 
drowsiness, headache, irritability.  
Eye disorders:  
On rare occasions (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), photophobia and conjunctivitis with corneal 
calcifications may occur at very high doses.  
Cardiac disorders:  
In the event of hypercalcaemia, cardiac arrhythmi a may occur.  
Gastrointestinal disorders:  
Nausea, vomiting, dryness of the mouth, constipation, taste disorders, with a metallic taste, 
abdominal cramps; in the event of progressive hypercalcaemia, anorexia may occur.  
Hepatobiliary disorders:  
With high levels of calcaemia, an increase in transaminase (ALT and AST) may occur.  
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:  
In the event of hypercalcaemia, initially bone and muscle pain, and calcifications in the  soft 
tissues may occur.  
Renal and urinary disorders:  
Manifestations of hypercalcaemia are: nephrocalcinosis and deterioration of renal function (with 
polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia and proteinuria)  
General disorders and administration site conditions:  
Delayed symptoms of hypercalcaemia are: rhinor rhea, pruritus, hyperthermia, and decrease  in 
libido.  
  
Protocol CTAP101 -CL-[ADDRESS_171869] is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of th e medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the Spanish System of 
Pharmacovigilance of Medicinal Products for Human Use: www.notificaRAM.es . 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms:  
The administration of vitamin  D at high doses or over long periods of time may cause 
hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphataemia and renal insufficiency. Initial symptoms of 
intoxication may include the following: weakness, fatigue, drowsiness, headache, anorexia, 
dryness of the mo uth, metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal spasms, polyuria, polydipsia, 
nocturia, constipation or diarrhoea, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, exanthema, hypotony (in particular 
in babies), muscle or bone pain and irritability.  
Among the most delayed sym ptoms of hypercalcaemia are: rhinorrhea, pruritus, decrease in 
libido, nephrocalcinosis, renal insufficiency, osteoporosis in adults, arrested  growth in children, 
weight loss, anaemia, conjunctivitis with calcification, photophobia, pancreatitis, increase in the 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), albuminuria, hypercholesterolaemia, increase in transaminase (ALT 
and AST), hyperthermia, generalised vascular calcification, convulsions and calcification of the 
soft tissue. Rarely, patients may develop hypertension or p sychotic symptoms; serum alkaline 
phosphatase can decrease; water -electrolyte imbalance together with moderate acidosis may give 
rise to cardiac arrhythmia.  
In more serious situations in which calcaemia exceeds 12  mg/dL, fainting, metabolic acidosis and 
coma may occur. Although the symptoms of overdose are usually reversible, renal or heart failure 
may occur.  
It is accepted that serum levels of 25­OH -cholecalciferol greater than 150  ng/mL may be 
associated with an increase in the incidence of undesirable ef fects.  
The increase in calcium, phosphate, albumin and blood urea nitrogen, and cholesterol and 
transaminase in the blood is typi[INVESTIGATOR_149231].  
Treatment:  
The treatment for intoxication by [CONTACT_149298]:  
1. Withdrawing  treatment (with calcifediol) and any calcium supplement that is being 
administered.  
2. Following  a low -calcium diet. To increase the excretion of calcium, administering large 
volumes of fluids, both orally and parenterally, is recommended, and if necessar y, to 
administer glucocorticoids and forced loop diuretics such as furosemide.

 5.  PHARMACOLOGIC AL PROPERTIES  
5.1   properties  
Pharmacological group: Vitamin  D and analogues. Calcifediol. ATC code: A11CC06  
Mechanism of action  
Vitamin  D has two main forms: D2 (ergocalciferol) and D 3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin  D3 is 
synthesised in the skin through exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet radiation) and it is obtained in the 
diet. Vitamin  D3 must undergo a two -step metabolic process to be active; the first step occurs in 
the microsomal fraction of the liver where it is hy droxylated in position  25 
(25­hydroxycholecalciferol or calcifediol); the second process takes place in the kidneys where 
1.25­dihydroxycholecalciferol or calcitriol is formed through intervention of the enzyme 
25­hydroxycholecalciferol 1­hydroxylase; the conversion to 1.25­hydroxycholecalciferol is 
regulated by [CONTACT_149299], by [CONTACT_149300]; there are other metabolites with unknown function. From the 
kidneys, 1.25­hydroxycholec alciferol is transported to the destination tissues (intestine, bone, 
possibly kidney and parathyroid glands) by [CONTACT_149301].  
 effects  
Vitamin  D primarily increases the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the inte stine and 
promotes normal bone formation and mineralisation, and acts on three levels:  
Intestine: it stimulates the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine.  
Bone: calcitriol stimulates bone formation by [CONTACT_149302].  
Kidneys: calcitriol stimulates the tubular reabsorption of calcium.  
In the parathyroid glands: vitamin  D inhibits the secretion of the . 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption  
Calcifediol or 25­hydroxycholecalciferol, such as vitamin  D analogues, is absorbed in the 
intestine if the absorption of fats is normal, through the chylomicrons, principally in the middle 
sections of the small intestine; approximately 75 –80% is absorbed t his way.  
Distribution  
Calcifediol is the main circulating form of vitamin  D. The serum concentrations of 25(OH) -
cholecalciferol reflect the organism’s vitamin  D reserves which are usually between 25 and 
40 ng/mL (62.5 to 100  nmol/L) in healthy individuals.  Following the oral administration of 
calcifediol, the time in which the maximum serum concentration is reached is approximately 
4 hours. Its half-life is around 18 to 21  days and its storage in the adipose tissue is less significant 
than that of vitamin  D, due to its lower liposolubility; calcifediol is stored in the adipose and 
muscle tissue for extended periods of time. The pharmaceutical form of soft capsules offers a 
22% higher bioavailability than the pharmaceutical form of an oral solution in vials. This 
difference is not considered clinically significant given that the dose must be determined on an 
individual basis depending on the serum levels of 25­OH -cholecalciferol and calcium, and these 
levels must be controlled during the treatment.  
Metabolism or Biotransformation  
Elimination  
Calcifediol is principally excreted in the bile.

 5.3  Preclinical safety data  
High doses of vitamin  D (from 4 to 15  times the recommended doses in humans) have been 
shown to be teratogenic in animals, but there are only a few studies that have been carried out in 
humans. Vitamin  D may cause hypercalcaemia in the mother which also gives rise to 
supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome, retinopathy and mental delay in children or newborn 
infants.

glucoc orticoids)  
- Patients with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac 
disease  
- Those recently treated for Vitamin D3 deficiency, and requiring maintenance 
therapy.  
Special populations  
Renal impairment  
InVita D3 should not be used in c ombination with calcium in patients with severe renal 
impairment.  
Hepatic impairment  
No posology adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment.  
Method of administration  
Oral – The capsules should be swallowed whole with water.  
Patients should be advised to take InVita D3 preferably with a meal (see section 5.2  
Pharmacokinetic properties - “Absorption”).  
 4.3 Contraindications  
• Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
• Hypercalcaemia and/or hyper calciuria.  
• Nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis  
• Serious renal impairment  
• Hypervitaminosis D  
• Pseudohypoparathyroidismas the vitamin D requirement may be reduced due to phases of 
normal vitamin D sensitivity, involving the risk of prolonged overdo se. Better -regulatable 
vitamin D derivatives are available for this.  
• Pregnancy  
• Children and adolescents (under 18 years of age)  
4.[ADDRESS_171877] on calcium and phosphate levels should be monitored. The risk of soft tissue calcification 
should be taken into account.  
Caution is required in patients receiving treatment for cardiovascular disease (see section 4.5  
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction - cardiac glycosides 
including digitalis).  
InVita D3 should be prescribed with caution in patients with sarcoidosis, due to a possible 
increase in the metabolism of Vitamin D3 in its active form. In t hese patients the serum and 
urinary calcium levels should be monitored.  
Allowances should be made for the total dose of Vitamin D3 in cases associated with treatments 
already containing Vitamin D3, foods enriched with Vitamin D3, cases using milk enriched with 
Vitamin D3, and the patient’s level of sun exposure.  
There is no clear evidence for causation between Vitamin D3 supplementation and renal stones, 
but the risk is plausible, especially in the context of concomitant calcium supplementation. The

 need fo r additional calcium supplementation should be considered for individual patients. 
Calcium supplements should be given under close medical supervision.  
Oral administration of high -dose Vitamin D3 (500,000 IU by [CONTACT_149304]) was reported to 
result i n an increased risk of fractures in elderly subjects, with the greatest increase occurring 
during the first 3 months after dosing.  
 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Concomitant use of anticonvulsants (such as phe nytoin) or barbiturates (and possibly other drugs 
that induce hepatic enzymes) may reduce the effect of Vitamin D3 by [CONTACT_149305].  
In cases of treatment with thiazide diuretics, which decrease urinary elimination of calcium, 
monitoring of serum calcium concentration is recommended.  
Concomitant use of glucocorticoids can decrease the effect of Vitamin D3.  
In cases of treatment with drugs containing digitalis and other cardiac glycosides, the 
administration of Vitamin D3 may increase the risk of digitalis toxicity (arrhythmia).  
Strict medical supervision is needed, together with serum calcium concentration and 
electrocardiographic monitoring if necessary.  
Simultaneous treatment with ion exchange resin such as cholestyramine, colestipol hydrochlori de, 
orlistat or laxative such as paraffin oil may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of Vitamin D3.  
The cytotoxic agent actinomycin and imidazole antifungal agents interfere with Vitamin D3 
activity by [CONTACT_149306] [ADDRESS_171879] shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3  Preclinical safety data). The 
recommended daily intake for pregnant women is 400 IU, however, in women who are 
considered to be Vitamin D3 deficient a higher dose may be required (up to 2000 IU/day - 10 
drops with the oral drops presentation).  
During pregnancy women should follow the advice of their medical practitioner as their 
requirements may var y depending on the severity of their disease and their response to treatment 
Vitamin D3 and its metabolites are excreted in breast milk.  
Breast -feeding  
Vitamin D3 can be prescribed while the patient is breast -feeding if necessary. This 
supplementation does  not replace the administration of Vitamin D3 in the neonate  
Fertility  
There is no data regarding treatment with vitaminD3 and its effects on fertility.

Website: www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowca rd. 
4.9  Overdose  
Symptoms of overdose  
Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and colecalciferol (vitamin D3) have a relatively low therapeutic 
index. The threshold for vitamin D intoxication is between 40,[ADDRESS_171882] intake of vitamin D 
without medical supervision.  
Overdose leads to increased serum and urinary phosphorus levels, as well as hypercalcaemic 
syndrome and consequently calcium deposits in the tissues and above all in the kidneys 
(nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis) and the vessels.  
Discontinue InVita D3 when calcaemia exceeds 10.6 mg/dl (2.65 mmol/l) or if the calciuria 
exceeds 300 mg/24 hours in adults or 4 -6 mg/kg/day in children.  
Chronic overdosage may lead to vascular and organ calcification, as a result of hypercalcaemia.  
The symptoms of intoxication are little characteristic and manifest as nausea, vomiting, initially 
also diarrhoea, later constipation, loss of appetite, weariness, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, 
muscle weakness, persistent sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], azotaemia, polydipsia and polyuria and, in the final stage, 
dehydration. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_149234], hypercalciuria, as well as 
increased serum [ADDRESS_171883] measure is to discontinue the vitamin D preparation; it takes several weeks to normalise 
hypercalcaemia caused by [CONTACT_1996] D  intoxication.  
Depending on the degree of hypercalcaemia, measures include a diet that is low in calcium or free 
of calcium, abundant liquid intake, increase of urinary excretion by [CONTACT_149308], as well as the administration of glucocortic oids and calcitonin.  
If kidney function is adequate, calcium levels can be reliably lowered by [CONTACT_149309] (3 –6 liters in 24 hours) with addition of furosemide and, in some 
circumstances, also 15 mg/kg body weight/hour so dium edetate accompanied by [CONTACT_149310]. In oligoanuria, in contrast, haemodialysis (calcium -free dialysate) 
is necessary.  
No special antidote exists.

 It is recommended to point out the symptoms of potential overdose to patients u nder chronic 
therapy with higher doses of vitamin D (nausea, vomiting, initially also diarrhoea, later 
constipation, anorexia, weariness, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, muscle weakness, persistent 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], azotaemia, polydipsia and polyuria).  
[ADDRESS_171885] in the presence of bile, so the 
administr ation with the major meal of the day might therefore facilitate the absorption of Vitamin 
D3. 
Distribution and biotransformation  
It is hydroxylated in the liver to form 25 -hydroxy -cholecalciferol and then undergoes further 
hydroxylation in the kidney to form the active metabolite 1, 25 -dihydroxy - cholecalciferol 
(calcitriol).  
Elimination  
The metabolites circulate in the blood bound to a specific α – globin, Vitamin D3 and its 
metabolites are excreted mainly in the bile and faeces.  
Characteristics in Speci fic Groups of Subjects or Patients  
A 57% lower metabolic clearance rate is reported in subjects with renal impairment as compared 
with that of healthy volunteers.  
Decreased absorption and increased elimination of Vitamin D3 occurs in subjects with 
malabsor ption.  
Obese subjects are less able to maintain Vitamin D3 levels with sun exposure, and are likely to 
require larger oral doses of Vitamin D3 to replace deficits.  
5.[ADDRESS_171886] commonly reported were increased calciuria 
and decreased phosphaturia and protei nuria. Hypercalcaemia has been reported in high doses. In a 
state of prolonged hypercalcaemia, histological alterations (calcification) were more frequently 
borne by [CONTACT_8212], heart, aorta, testes, thymus and intestinal mucosa.  
Colecalciferol has been s hown to be teratogenic at high doses in animals.  
At doses equivalent to those used therapeutically, colecalciferol has no teratogenic activity.

be monitored through measurements of serum creatinine. Monitoring is especially important in 
elderly patients on concomitant treatment with cardiac glycosides or diuretics (see section 4.5) 
and in patients with a high tendency to ca lculus formation. In case of hypercalciuria (exceeding 
300 mg (7.5 mmol)/24 hours) or signs of impaired renal function the dose should be reduced or 
the treatment discontinued.  
InVita D3 should be used with caution in patients with impairment of renal func tion and the 
effect on calcium and phosphate levels should be monitored. The risk of soft tissue calcification 
should be taken into account. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, vitamin D in the form of 
cholecalciferol is not metabolised normally a nd other forms of vitamin D should be used.  
The content of vitamin D (800 IU) in InVita D3 should be considered when prescribing other 
medicinal products containing vitamin D. Additional doses of vitamin D should be taken under 
close medical supervision. In such cases it is necessary to monitor serum calcium levels and 
urinary calcium excretion frequently.  
4.[ADDRESS_171893] of vitamin D since the 
metabolism increases.  
Excessive dosing of vitamin D can induce hypercalcaemia, which may increase the risk of 
digitalis toxicity and serious arrhythimias due to the additive inotropic effects. The 
electrocardiogram (ECG) and serum calcium levels of patients should be closely monitored.  
Glucocortic oid steroids may increase vitamin D metabolism and elimination. During concomitant 
use, it may be necessary to increase the dose of InVita D3 tablets.  
Simultaneous treatment with ion exchange resins such as cholestyramine or laxatives such as 
paraffin oil may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin D. Orlistat may potentially 
impair the absorption of colecalciferol as it is fat -soluble.  
The cytotoxic agent actinomycin and imidazole antifungal agents interfere with vitamin D 
activity by [CONTACT_149306] 25 -hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D by [CONTACT_149311], 25 -hydroxyvitamin D -1-hydroxylase.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy   
Vitamin D deficiency is harmful for mother and child. There are no signals that recommended 
doses of vitamin D3 are harmful for the embryo/fetus. High doses of vitamin D have been shown 
to have teratogenic effects in animal experiments. Overdose of vitamin  D must be avoided during 
pregnancy, as prolonged hypercalcaemia can lead to physical and mental retardation, 
supravalvular aortic stenosis and retinopathy of the child.  
InVita D3 can be used up to 2,000 IU/day only in case of a Vitamin D deficiency.  
  
Protocol CTAP101 -CL-[ADDRESS_171894] is, however, 
unlikely.  
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Adverse reactions frequencies are defined as: uncommon ≥ 1/1,000, < 1/100), rare ≥1/10,000, 
<1/1,000) or not known (cannot b e estimated from the available data  
Immune system disorders   
Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): Hypersensitivity reactions such as 
angio -oedema or laryngeal oedema.  
Metabolism and nutrition disorders   
Uncommon: Hypercalcaemia and hype rcalciuria.  
Skin and subcutaneous disorders   
Rare: Pruritus, rash and urticaria.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions   
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorization of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme 
Website: www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard  
4.9  Overdose  
Overdose can lead to hyper -vitaminosis D. An excess  of vitamin D causes abnormally high levels 
of calcium in the blood, which can eventually severely damage the soft tissues, and kidneys. 
Tolerable Upper Intake Level for vitamin D3 (colecalciferol) is set at 4000 IU (100 µg) per day. 
Vitamin D3 should not be confused with its active metabolites. colecalciferol  
Symptoms of hypercalcaemia may include anorexia, thirst, nausea, vomiting, constipation, 
abdominal pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, mental disturbances, polydipsia, polyuria, bone pain, 
nephrocalcinosi s, renal calculi and in severe cases, cardiac arrhythmias. Extreme hypercalcaemia 
may result in coma and death.  
Persistently high calcium levels may lead to irreversible renal damage and soft tissue 
calcification.  
Treatment of hypercalcaemia: The treatment  with vitamin D must be discontinued. Treatment 
with thiazide diuretics, lithium, vitamin A, and cardiac glycosides must also be discontinued. 
Rehydration, and, according to severity, isolated or combined treatment with loop diuretics, 
bisphosphonates, cal citonin and corticosteroids should be considered. Serum electrolytes, renal 
function and diuresis must be monitored. In severe cases, ECG and CVP should be followed.

5.1  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Vitamin D   
Sun exposure: UVB light converts 7 -dehydrocholesterol, found in the skin, to colecalciferol.  
Absorption: Vitamin D is easily absorbed in the small intestine. Food intake potentially increases 
the absorption of vitamin D.  
Distribution and biotransformation: Colecalciferol and its metabolites circulate in the blood 
bound to a specific globulin. Colecalciferol is converted in the liver by [CONTACT_149312] 25 -
hydroxycholecalciferol. It is then furt her converted in the kidneys to 1,25 - 
dihydroxycholecalciferol. 1,25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol is the active metabolite responsible for 
increasing calcium absorption. Vitamin D, which is not metabolised, is stored in adipose and 
muscle tissues.  
After a sing le oral dose of colecalciferol, the maximum serum concentrations of the primary 
storage form are reached after approximately 7 days. 25(OH)D 3 is then slowly eliminated with an 
apparent half -life in serum of about 50 days. Colecalciferol and its metabolites  are excreted 
mainly in the bile and faeces.  
Elimination: Vitamin D is excreted mainly in bile and faeces with a small percentage found in 
urine.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
At doses far higher than the human therapeutic range teratogenicity has been obse rved in animal 
studies. No other relevant data is available that has not been mentioned elsewhere in the SmPC 
(see section 4.6  and 4.9).

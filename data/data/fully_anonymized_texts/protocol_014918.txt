 Background and Study Rationale  
1 Introduction  
A1. With the ongoing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19), there is a growing 
population of COVID -19 survivors.  COVID -19 is a public health crisis. Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_11520] 2 (SARS -CoV-2), the virus responsible fo r the COVID -19 pandemic, is 
associated with a high risk of pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction.1-4 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_626315], COVID -19 continues to spread. As the case fatality rate for COVID -19 is 
estimated at <1%,5 it follows that along with the pandemic increase of COVID -19 cases, there will 
be a marked increase of COVID -19 survivors in the general population.  
 
A2. COVID -19 survivors may be at an elevated risk of major adverse cardiovascu lar events 
(MACE) . Pneumonia is the prominent feature of COVID -19.[ADDRESS_834618] several years, we and 
others demonstrated that survivors of pneumonia (irrespective of etiology), instead of going back 
to their pre -infection baseline health trajectories, enter a trajectory of increased risk of MACE,6-20 
including new onset heart failure, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke,  as demonstrated in 
Figure 1 . For example, we identified 591 pneumonia cases in the Cardiovascular Health Study 
(CHS) and 680 pneumonia cases in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.6,7 In 
CHS, 206 participants (35%) experienced a MACE during the 10 years after their pneumonia 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Of these, 104 (51%) experienced MI, 35 (17%) experienced stroke, and 67 (33%) 
experienced fatal coronary heart disease events. Between 91 days and 1 ye ar following 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], compared to matched controls, the HR for MACE was 2.10 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.59 -2.60); during the second year after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the HR was 1.89 (95% CI 
1.46-2.33). We found similar risk of MACE following pneumon ia hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626316]. In both 
cohorts, we observed that the risk associated with pneumonia was markedly higher than the risk 
associated with traditional risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, and smoking, among others).

 A3. There is a multifaceted pathophysiologic relationship between pneumonia and 
cardiovascular (CV) disease. As previously discussed,[ADDRESS_834619] for months after resolution of the acute event.21 
Inflammatory processes govern the progression of atherosclerosis from fatty streaks to advanced 
atherosclerotic 
plaques and their 
complication and 
evolution i nto clinical 
CV events such as MI 
and stroke.22  Acute 
and chronic 
inflammation can lead 
to endothelial 
dysfunction, increase 
arterial stiffness and 
impair pulsatile 
arterial 
hemodynamics (all of 
which can mediate CV 
risk independently of 
atherosclerosis).23 
Even in the absence 
of systemic 
inflammation, 
progression of 
vascul ar and target 
organ damage initially 
sustained during 
acute pneumonia 
events could mediate 
long-term CV risk.  
 
A4. Because of its unique pathophysiology, COVID -19 may distinctly predispose patients 
to chronic pulmonary disease, MACE and micro - and macrovascular damage/dysfunction. 
COVID -19 may  predispose patients to particularly elevated risk of CV damage due to its 
distinctive proinflammatory and prothrombotic pathophysiology ( Figure 2 ). In the acute phase, 
COVID -19 is associate d with a relatively high incidence of thromboembolic events, MI, stroke, 
and severe arrhythmias.24,25 Hyperinflammation and micro - and/or macrovascular 
thromboembolic or in situ  thrombotic complications have been observed acutely and sub -acutely 
in COVID -[ADDRESS_834620] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Importantly, viral inclusion bodies within endothelial cells and sequestered mononuclear and 
polymorpho nuclear cellular infiltration of the endothelium are seen in COVID -19, along with 
evidence of endothelial cell apoptosis.37 This is consistent with the presence of endotheliitis, which 
could lead to acute and chronic vascular dysfunction resulting in target organ dysfunction and 
increased CV risk.  Thromboembolic disease may also result in reduced a erobic capacity and 
exercise intolerance due to potentially chronically effects on the pulmonary vasculature.29,30

associated with a 14.5 -fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.41 -20.32) elevated hazard of incident 
CKD; there was  a 5.2 -fold (95% CI 3.91 -6.93) elevated hazard of incident CKD in the first five 
years following pneumonia. COVID -[ADDRESS_834622] subclinical kidney injury that is not identifie d 
by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_626318] (i.e. creatinine -based eGFR) during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].38,39 Even among 
individuals without evidence of acute or persistent kidney damage while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], the 
hyperimmune and coagulopathic mechanisms of COVID -19 may predispose COVID -19 survivors 
to an elevated risk of subsequent decline in kidney function. Our gr oup has preliminary data 
demonstrating a strong association of decline in kidney function with elevated 1 - and 3 -year risk 
of MACE, regardless of baseline kidney function (see A8. Preliminary Data ). Thus, decline in 
kidney function among COVID -19 survivors  may be an important mediator of future CV risk in 
these patients.  
 
A6. Several interrelated mechanisms of COVID -19 may be linked to acute multiorgan 
dysfunction and  intermediate - and long -term target organ damage in COVID -19 survivors.  
In comparison to ot her bacterial and viral pneumoniae, inflammation and hypercoagulability in 
COVID -19 may be related to its unique interaction with the renin -angiotensin system (RAS). 
Angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a counter -regulatory component of the RAS, facilit ates 
SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_834623].40 ACE converts angiotensin I (Ang I) to 
Ang II, which acts on the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT 1R), resulting in vasoconstriction, sodium and 
fluid retention by [CONTACT_10521], oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and impaired fibrinolysis.41,[ADDRESS_834624] opposition to the cascade of physiological effects of the ACE/Ang II pathway, the net 
effect of the ACE2/Ang -(1-7) pathway is vasodilation and anti -inflammation. ACE2 hydroly zes 
Ang II, converting it to Ang -(1-7). The conversion of Ang II to Ang -(1-7) diminishes the availability 
of Ang II to bind AT 1R, forestalling the vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic 
effects of AT 1R activation.41-45 Additionally, Ang -(1-7) acts on the Mas receptor, resulting in 
vasodilation, natriuresis, and a reduction in oxidative stress and inflammati on.46,47 Collectively, 
Ang-(1-7) counteracts the pro -inflammatory and pro -fibrotic effects of Ang II in the heart and 
kidneys.48,49 In animal models, unopposed Ang II in the setting of diminished ACE2 upregulated 
inflammatory cytokines interferon -γ, interleukin -6, and monocyte chemoattractant protei n-1, and 
increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal ‑regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2 and c -Jun N -
terminal kinase (JNK)1/2 signaling pathways.50 Furthermore, AT 1R activation by [CONTACT_626352] -
thrombotic effects, including enhanced platelet activation and impaired fibrinolysis, resulting in 
hypercoagulability.44,51,52 Ang II also stimulates plasminogen activator inhibitor -1, further 
promoting thrombus production.42 The pro -thrombotic effects of Ang II are downregulated by 
[CONTACT_626353]2 -mediated conversion into Ang -(1-7) and subsequent Ang -(1-7) signaling via MasR. ACE2 
is more promin ently expressed in the kidneys than in the lungs, and direct viral invasion of the 
kidneys may promote systemic abnormalities in RAS activity.53,[ADDRESS_834625] 
may contribute to the hyperinflammation, hypercoagulability, and endothelial dysfunction in 
COVID -19, and may mediate both acute and long-term target organ CV and kidney damage.55,56  
CAPRICORN Study   Page 9 
Version: [ADDRESS_834626] studies evaluating COVID -19 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626319], 
and are thus prone to misclassification of outcomes, unmeasured confounding, and confounding 
by [CONTACT_626354] (e.g., those with underlying comorbidities are more likely to und ergo 
frequent testing, whereas those without underlying comorbidities may not undergo follow -up 
testing at all). Administrative and retrospective studies also rely upon patients receiving all of their 
care within the same health system and do not adequatel y account for outmigration (e.g., due to 
change in insurance or change in geographic location) or loss to follow up, which may be 
exacerbated in the current setting due to high rates of unemployment and other economic 
pressures surrounding the COVID -19 pan demic. Administrative studies will also lack detailed, 
prospective, quantitative assessment of vascular function, a likely important mechanistic 
contributor to MACE in these patients. Moreover, to the degree that COVID -19 is a new disease 
and the mechanism s that may mediate its relationship with subsequent CV risk are unknown, it 
is essential to couple a careful assessment of incident CV events with deep mechanistic 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_626320]. Our team is experienced with these  
approaches and has been applying them in other settings (most notably, pneumonia of all cause, 
heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction, and CKD). Our team also has a track record of 
translation of mechanistic phenotypes to the testing of novel  candidate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. We aim to apply 
our experience and skills in the most expeditious fashion to contribute to a better understanding 
of intermediate - and long -term CV risk in the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_626321] -19 survivors.

(14) Social determinants of health questionnaire  
(15) Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)  
(16) In a subset of participants, we will also perform supi[INVESTIGATOR_626322] (i.e., peak oxygen consumption, VO 2). 
 
These tests are brief and in combination will take about ~ 5 hours. These assessments will be 
performed upon enrollment (baseline visit) and will be repeated at approximately 1 8-month 
intervals for a total of 3 tests (except for bicycle testing, which will  only occur at baseline). 
Participants will  also be followed prospectively for incident cardiovascular events via a 
combination of medical record reviews and phone calls  as nee ded in order to adjudicate specific 
outcomes. Adjudication of all -cause death may be assisted using data from the Social Security 
Death Index. Expert clinical adjudicators will identify MACE (incident HF, MI, coronary 
revascularization, serious arrhythmia, stroke, peripheral artery disease [PAD], or death) by 
[CONTACT_626355][INVESTIGATOR_78685].  
 
Given availability of staff and/or Center for Human Phenomics Sciences staff to complete study 
procedures such as endothelial cell harvesting, supi[INVESTIGATOR_626323]2 testing, and ultrasound, some 
participants may be asked to have their procedures done in different days to enhance data 
completeness and fe asibility of scheduling.

 Carotid images will be processed offline to assess the following metrics:  
1) Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) : We will measure CC-IMT in near and far walls and in 
the anterior, lateral and posterior projections using automated edge -detection software 
(Carotid Studio; Quipu, Italy). A carefully tra ined technician  will measure CIMT at these sites 
as the distance between the intimal -luminal and the medial -adventitial interfaces of the 
carotid artery wall,58 as done previously by [CONTACT_27156].59-62 CIMT will be computed as the 
mean of all measurements.  
2) Carotid stiffness : We will perform time -resolved semi -automated wall tracking of the 
common carotid lumen diameter using view that best demonstrates both the near and far 
walls  using automated edge -detection software (Carotid Studio; Quipu, Italy) . As recently 
reviewed by [CONTACT_27156], when performed assessments of local stiffness it is essential to 
avoid confounding by [CONTACT_626357].63 Carotid distension waveforms will be used along 
with calibrated carotid tonometry waveforms to calculate local carotid PWV (a measure of 
wall stiffness), using an expression equivalent to the Bramwell -Hill equation, which 
combines pressure and diameter (ln(Dia)P method), which is not susceptible to wave 
reflections:  𝑃𝑊𝑉=√1
2𝜌𝑑𝑃
𝑑𝑙𝑛(𝐷𝑖𝑎) , where PWV is calculated from the slope of the linear 
segment of the loop constructed from plotting pressure as a function of the natural logarithm 
of diameter64. 
 
Impedance Cardiography (ICG) : Study subjects will undergo a resting impedance cardiogram 
(Z-logic; Exxer, Buenos Aires, Argentina) for the evaluation of cardiac output, stroke volume, 
and cardiac contractility , which will allow the estimation of arterial compliance and other 
parameters of interest. ICG will be performed depending on time and equipment availability. 
ICG is a form of pl ethysmography that utilizes changes in thoracic electrical impedance to 
estimate changes in blood volume in the aorta and changes in fluid volume in the thorax. The 
ICG procedure involves the placement of electrical leads (similar to ECG leads) on the pati ent’s 
neck and chest. A low -amplitude, high -frequency alternating current is delivered from some 
sensors while other sensors detect instantaneous changes in voltage. As suggested by [CONTACT_626358]’s 
law, when a constant current is applied to the thorax, the changes i n voltage are directly 
proportional to the changes in measured impedance. The overall thoracic electrical impedance, 
called base impedance (Z0) is the sum of the impedances of the components of the thorax, 
including fat, cardiac and skeletal muscle, lung a nd vascular tissue, bone, and air. Changes 
from thoracic electrical impedance occur due to changes in lung volumes with respi[INVESTIGATOR_626325]. 
The rapi[INVESTIGATOR_626326], leaving the impedance changes due to ventricular ejection. These impedance 
changes have been shown to be accurate predictors of stroke volume, and with the use of 
mathematical algorit hms, ICG allows for accurate non -invasive measurements of stroke volume 
and cardiac output. 65,[ADDRESS_834632].   
 
Pulmonary Function Testing : We will perform a basic expi[INVESTIGATOR_626327] (DLCO) and lung volumes.67 We will utilize an FDA -approved Easyone Pro 
Lab Respi[INVESTIGATOR_626328] (NDD systems Andover, [LOCATION_005] ; 510K K161534 ). In 
this test, subjects perform a forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_626329] a disposable probe meter (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]), primarily 
to determined forced vital capacity and forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_626330] 1 s (FEV1). As 
recommended, DLCO measurements will be performed in duplicate f or enhanced accuracy. In

CAPRICORN Study   Page 15 
Version: [ADDRESS_834633] will in total ~20 minutes.  Pulmonary function tests will not be performed if participants 
are receiving >2L/min of supplemental oxygen.  
 
Aerobic capacity : In a subset of participants who agree to additional testing , have no 
contraindications to exercise testing (such elevated fall risk or severely elevated blood pressure 
>180/100)  and contingent on availability of equipment, personnel and funding, we will use a 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_626333] (VO 2) during exercise. This subset of s ubjects will perform a maximal exertion limited 
exercise test using a graded -exercise protocol. We will use a supi[INVESTIGATOR_610492] (Stress Echo Ergometer 1505, Medical Positioning, Inc, Kansas City, 
MO). Subjects will undergo expi[INVESTIGATOR_610493] a Parvo Medics True One 2400 device 
(Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT)  or equivalent. Resistance began at 15 W for 3 minutes, increasing to 
25 W for 3 minutes, and then increasing by 25 W every 3 minutes thereafter. Breath -by-breath 
information will be recorded. We will use custo m-designed software already developed in Matlab 
(MathWorks, Natick, MA) at our lab for offline processing and quantification of all exercise data.68 
All data quantification will be blinded to treatment. Given costs considerations and funding 
availability, we will offer this additional component to former participants of the FERMIN trial 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) but can be expanded to other participants as additi onal funding becomes 
available.  
 
 
Arterial tonometry : Carotid -femoral PWV will be measured with arterial applanation tonometry, 
which considered the clinical gold -standard method for the assessment of large artery 
stiffness.63,69,70 We will use a commercially available system (SphygmoCor CVMS , AtCor Medical) 
with a high -fidelity applanation tonometer (Millar Instruments). This involves sequential recordings 
of carotid and femoral arterial waveforms using a pen -like high -fidelity applanation tonometer 
placed on top of the artery on the body surface, along with electrocardiographic measurements 
so that the R wave of the QRS can be used as a time -reference point to compare both recordings 
and compute the pulse transit time between the carotid and femoral locations. Surface 
measurements of distance between carotid and femoral sites are performed to estimate intra -
aortic path length (80% of the direct body surface dist ance between the sites). Carotid -femoral 
PWV is computed as distance/transit time. Radial and carotid applanation tonometry will be 
performed as well. Brachial arterial pressures will be measured with a fully validated oscillometric 
device ( Omron HEM 907 -XL BP monitor ; Omron Healthcare ; 510K  K032305  or BP+ device, 510K 
K121266 ). Arm circumference will be measured, and the appropriate cuff size will be placed. 
Radial waveforms will be calibrated with brachial systolic and diastolic pressures. Radial 
pressures will be used to calibrate the carotid pressure waveform, which serves as a surrogate of 
the central pressure waveform, and will be used to obtain central pulse pressure.  
 
Flow mediated dilation (FMD) : Brachial artery FMD and hyperemic flow veloci ty, which evaluate 
conduit artery endothelial function and microvascular function, respectively,71,72 are important 
indicators of vascular health and predictors of CV risk.73,74 FMD will be measured using a semi -
automated device equipped with an ad hoc  vascular ultrasound probe (UNEX Corporation,  
Nagoya, Japan). In this test, a brachial cuff is inflated to 50 mmHg above the systolic blood 
pressure, which is measured in advance. The inflation is held for 5 minutes, and the cuff is then 
deflated. The maximum diameter of the blood vessel of the same region is tracked continuously 
after deflation. The FMD is calculated as follows: FMD (%) = (maximum diameter − diameter at 
rest) × 100/diameter at rest.   Hyperemic brachial artery flow velocity will be determined by [CONTACT_626361] [ADDRESS_834634], we will use wireless near -infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices to 
measure microvascular oxygenation as feasible. We will use a wireless PortaMon device and a 
wireless PortaLite device (Artinis medical systems; The Netherlands) to measure f orearm 
CAPRICORN Study   Page 16 
Version: [ADDRESS_834635] and during the FMD procedure. The NIRS devices are research -only devices 
and will not be used to make medical decisions.  
 
 
Ankle -brachial index (ABI):  ABI uses non -invasive oscillometric blood pressure measurements 
in the ankle a nd upper arm to provide a measure of overt or clinically occult peripheral arterial 
disease. It is a well -established predictor of cardiovascular events and death.77-80 We will 
perform automated ABI measurements using a VaSera Device (Fukuda -Denshi; Japan ; 510K 
K115121 ). 
 
Sublingual microscopy : Sublingual microcirculation will be visualized using sublingual 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_434471] a hand -held sublingual microscope (Microscan device; Microvision Medical; 
Amsterdam, Netherlands)  by a trained technician.[ADDRESS_834636] five videos of the sublingual microcirculation will be 
recorded from different positions and will undergo appropriate quality control.81,82 Videos will be 
analyzed using dedicated software (AVA 4.3C software ; Microvision Medical; Amsterdam, 
Netherlands).83 We will calculate the Becker score,81 which is based on the principle that density 
of the vessels is proportional to the number of vessels crossing arbitrary lines.  In this score, three 
equidistant horizontal and three equidistant vertical lines are superimposed on the microsc opic 
image and vessel density is calculated as the number of vessels crossing the lines divided by [CONTACT_626362]. Microvascular density, our primary metric of microvascular health, will be 
computed as the density of vessels <20 μm in diamet er. We will also compute the proportion of 
perfused vessels as follows: 100 × (total number of vessels - [no flow + intermittent flow])/total 
number of vessels. Perfused vessel density, an estimate of functional capi[INVESTIGATOR_95168], will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_626363].81,[ADDRESS_834637] : If they are able, participants will be asked to perform a [ADDRESS_834638], we will use wireless n ear-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices to 
measure microvascular  oxygenation  as feasible . We will use two wireless  portamon devices and 
the wireless Brite device (Artinis medical systems; The Netherlands) to measure forearm, calf and 
brain oxygenation at rest and during the [ADDRESS_834639] pain during 
the previous month or a history of recent myocardial infarction (within a month), a r esting heart 
rate of more than 120, a systolic blood pressure of more than 180 mm Hg, and a diastolic blood 
pressure of more than 100 mm Hg. These are consistent with current guidelines 85. 
 
Thermal images : thermal imaging patterns depend on vascular and neural function and have 
been associated with cardiovascular risk factors.[ADDRESS_834640] thermal camera (FLIR C2;  FLIR, Wilsonville, OR). This device is for research only and 
will not be used to make medical decisions. Non-contact t hermal imaging is used to detect 
patterns of skin surface heat emissions from patients with various conditions , which has been 
shown to c orrelate with cardiovascular disease risk . This is a non -contact [CONTACT_626364] 17

 associated with any known risks.  
 
Breath condensate collection: Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) analysis is a developi[INVESTIGATOR_626334], non -invasive health diagnostics as new 
optimized analytical instrumentation platforms and detection methods are developed.87-93 Exhaled 
breath contains poten tially valuable metabolomic content due to gas exchange with blood at the 
pulmonary alveolar membrane interface. Various disease states often significantly change the 
entire pattern and relative abundances of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled br eath.87-
[ADDRESS_834641] the condensed exhaled fraction of alveolar air for about 5 -8 minutes using a 
commercially available device (Turbo AAV 14; MEDIVAC, Parma, Italy). This system utilizes 
plastic air collectors coupled with a condenser equipped with a CO 2 detector that routes collection 
of air (via an electronic valve) only when CO 2 levels are consistent with alveolar air (as opposed 
to dead space air). This device is for research only and will not be used to make medical decisions.  
We will use only new or sterilized plastic collection tubes. Exhaled air condensate will be aliquoted 
and frozen at -80°C. This procedure carries no known risks.  
 
Urine collection : In all participants, 10 -mL of urine will be collected and aliquoted.  
 
Veno us endothelial cell harvesting: endothelial cells will be collected from the antecubital 
vein using [ADDRESS_834642] the i ntravenous catheter 
and advance the J -wire to obtain the cells.   Once the J -wire is advanced and pulled back 
through the venous catheter, the distal portion of the wire is transferred to a 50 -ml conical tube 
containing a buffer solution for analyses. Analy ses will include RNA sequencing to assess gene 
expression and fixing for immunohistochemistry. This procedure will be optional depending on 
the availability of a trained research nurse at the time of the visit.  
 
Venous blood collection : In all participant s, we will collect 40 mL of venous blood, which will 
be aliquoted  as plasma, serum , buffy coat  (for future DNA extraction  and potential future genetic 
testing as funding becomes available ) and PAX gene tubes (for future RNA extraction) . 
 
24-hour ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring : Ambulatory BP monitoring will be performed 
using the SunTech Oscar2 ambulatory BP monitor to obtain 24 -hour brachial blood pressure 
measurements as well as estimates of central blood pressure 94. Prior to placement of the 
monitor, resting BP will be measured on both arms  while sitting and orthostatic blood pressure 
will be checked in one arm with a standing blood pre ssure checked approximately 3 minutes 
after rising . If the difference in systolic BP is <10mmHg the non -dominant arm will be used for 
monitoring; however, if the difference in systolic BP is ≥10mmHg the arm with higher pressure 
will be used. The mid -arm ci rcumference will be measured and recorded and a cuff appropriate 
for the arm circumference will be used. Participants will be instructed to engage in usual daily 
activities and avoid strenuous exercise for the [ADDRESS_834643]. BP wil l 
be measured every 30 minutes for 24 - hours. Participants will keep a diary documenting time to 
bed, time waking up, medications taken, and any other events of significance.  
 
Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) : SPPB is a well -established and objective 
assessment tool to evaluate lower extremity function and mobility. It is predictive of all -cause 
mortality95 and incident disability96 and has been associated with incident cardiovascular 
events97 in older adults. A study team member will administer 3 physical tests and assess the 
participant’s balance, gait, strength, and endurance by [CONTACT_626365]

(echocardiograms, cardiac MRIs, CT scans) in [CONTACT_610542]’ imaging core lab.  
 A medical record review including symptoms , past medical history, imaging, laboratory 
values , results of physical exam s, vital signs , hemodynamic values , and other test results ,w 
with sp ecial emphasis will be placed on collection of data related to the severity of the

curve during the longes t hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]; (3) For participants who didn’t get hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
we will use a modified SOFA score that includes the cardiac, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], coagulation and 
renal domains of the SOFA score because these components can be easily and reliably 
adjudicate d using electronic medical record review. For the respi[INVESTIGATOR_626338], we will apply a modified score used in which the arterial oxygen saturation is 
used instead of measured arterial oxygen saturation.   
 
Feasibility : all measurements will be acquired only whenever feasible. Some of these 
measurements may be non -feasible due to patient -specific factors including anatomic factors, 
technical difficulty and/or logistical issues. When measurements are not feasible, the re ason will 
be systematically recorded.

 6.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The Investigator will permit study -related monitoring, au dits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], the 
sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University c ompliance and quality assurance 
groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data 
collection instruments, study data etc).  
[ADDRESS_834656] no known risks.  
 
Venipuncture : According to the 2010 WHO guidelines on phlebotomy, major risks associated 
with venipuncture include hematoma at the site of venipuncture in 2 -3%, and vasovagal reactions 
and fainting in 1%.  
 
Endothelial cell harvesting:  The risks associated with the procurement of venous endothelial 
cells are low and are analogous to the risks that occur with placement of a venous catheter, which 
include pain, superficial phlebitis /venous blood clots and infection.   
 
During va rious procedures (echocardiography, arterial tonometry), we will use adhesive 
electrodes attached to the participant’s skin to record the electrical signal from the heart. These 
may occasionally cause skin itching and irritation.  
 
Risks of pulmonary function tests : Our pulmonary function tests will not involve challenging 
(such as methacholine administration)  and thus are very low risk. A potential risk is dizziness 
during forced maneuvers or shortness of breath during the 8-[ADDRESS_834657] muscles. There is a very low risk of 
pneumothorax from forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] .  
 
Risks of exercise testing : This test is used extensively for research purposes with minimal risk 
to subjects. The most significant risks of the test are dysrhythmias or other cardiovascular 
complications, which are extremely rare. These procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_626371].135,136 Non-
revascularized  myocardial ischemia, which may increase the risk of complications during exercise 
testing, is an exclusion criterion for the study. Furthermore, the procedure is voluntary and 
intended to only be performed in a subset of participants in the study and will n ot be performed in 
any participants with a contraindication to exercise, such as elevated risk of falls (as assessed by 
[CONTACT_473]) or severely elevated blood pressure (>180/100).  
 
Subjects may feel uncomfortable as a result of pushing themselves du ring the maximal effort 
exercise test. Subjects will likely feel short of breath and fatigued as a result of the exercise test. 
Various other complaints, such as nausea, lightheadedness, and other aches and pains are also 
possible as a result of the maxima l effort exercise study. Although exercise testing may result in 
exhaustion, rarely do people develop abnormal heart rate or heart complications during exercise 
tests. The risk of this happening is the same as if the participant would exert themselves duri ng 
stressful situations or during exercise elsewhere.  
CAPRICORN Study   Page 23 
Version: [ADDRESS_834658]. In 
addition to the blood pressure (generally increases) and heart rate (generally increases) changes 
during exe rcise, we will also monitor arterial saturation. This will be done non -invasively using a 
pulse oximeter. Of note, oxygen levels can decrease with exercise, even in individuals without 
significant cardiopulmonary disease.137 If the arterial saturation falls to below 88% (“severe 
exercise induced hypoxemia”138), we will alert the patient’s primary care provider as this may 
prompt consideration for additional or alternative causes for arterial hypoxemia.  
 
Risks of FMD measurements: The cuff inflation used for FMD may cause temporary bruising. 
The inflation itself may cause tingling in the hand/digits, which resolves after deflation.  
 
Risks of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring:  There is minimal physical risk from non -
invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A potential discomfort will be the squeezing from 
inflation of the blood pressure cuff, which may cause sleep disturbance for some participants.  
 
Risks of SPPB:  The gai t and balance tests may lead to falls and the repeat chair stand test 
require a vigorous effort.  However, these tests were found to be efficient, practical, and safe  to 
administer to thousands of older persons in a home setting without any injury or adverse 
outcome .139 
 
Risks of impedance cardiography : this procedure is not associated with any known risks. 
Electrodes or electrode gel may cause irritation or itching.

society in general may benefi t as a result of scientific discoveries obtained during the course of 
this study. However, this study may  provide novel information leading to the discovery and better 
understanding of long-term complications in COVID -19 survivors , which may in turn lead t o newer 
approaches for their treatment  or prevention. Results of research procedures will be shared with

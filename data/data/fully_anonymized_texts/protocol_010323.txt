Protocol Date: March 30, 2020  1.0 Background  
 
The novel coronavirus known as SARS- CoV-2 and the associated disease process 
COVID -19 (coronavirus disease 2019)  was first seen in late [ADDRESS_310548] that hasn’t been seen in generations. Although coronaviruses 
have been prevalent for millennia, this version is immunologically novel , and thus there 
is no natural  immunity to the virus . This has been a major reason for its  rapid spread 
across the world .  
 Previous members of the coronavirus family have typi[INVESTIGATOR_255632], though there have also been more virulent 
versions of this virus seen in the recent past , such as SARS (S evere Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_98158]) and MERS (Middle East Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223]). Similarly named, SARS- CoV-
[ADDRESS_310549] all ages, genders, 
and ethnicities. Everyone is susceptible to this virus.  
 
New diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for respi[INVESTIGATOR_255633] -based (PCR) diagnostics and multiplex assays 
are increasingly used in clinical laboratories for SARS- CoV-2 clinical detection and 
subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Rapid antigenic a nd genetic evolution has been expected for SARS -CoV-2 
strains, and a better understanding of SARS- CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics is needed to 
establish an effective vaccine.  
 
Our present understanding of the nature and extent of the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_255634] (U RT) 
microbiome in humans is limited. Furthermore, we have little understanding of how 
acute viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_255635]- CoV-[ADDRESS_310550]  posited that this is the primary source of

Protocol Date: March 30, 2020 infection and viral replication. Additionally, a high nasal/nasopharyngeal  viral load has 
been associated with increased symptoms and higher severity of the disease.  
 
Interestingly, there have been a number of studies recently looking at the effect of nasal 
saline irrigations in the setting of viral URIs, including coronaviruse s (not including 
SARS-CoV- 2). One of the major takeaways from these studies was decreased viral 
shedding in patients treated with saline irrigations compared to the control group. Nasal saline irrigations are available over the counter and widely viewed as both safe and 
affordable. Could these irrigations have a similar effect on the novel SARS-CoV- [ADDRESS_310551] on other viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]?   
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_310552] shown that the use of 
simple over the counter nasal saline irrigations can decrease viral shedding in th e setting 
of viral URIs, including the common coronavirus (not SARS-CoV- 2). Further, as SARS-
CoV-2 is a n enveloped virus, mild- detergent application with nasal saline would 
neutralize the virus further. It is our hypothesis that nasal saline or nasal saline with 
baby [CONTACT_255644]/viral load and viral transmission, 
secondary bacterial load, nasopharyngeal inflammation in patients infected with the 
novel SARS-CoV- 2.   
 
Specific Aim 1.  Define the longitudinal SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_310553] infections. When used properly, these irrigations are a safe and easy intervention available over the 
counter without a prescription. Additionally, baby [CONTACT_255645] a safe 
additive functioning as a surfactant when a small amount is added to the saline rinses 
which may  help augment clearance of the sinonasal cavity.  
 
Protocol Version #: 001   6 
Protocol Date: March 30, [ADDRESS_310554] for intranasal/sinus disease.  There 
have been a small number of studies showing a transient loss of smell when adding 
surfactant to nasal saline rinses, though this appears to resolve when surfactant is  
discontinued.  
 
 
4.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
List the criteria:

6.0 Study Procedures  
 
Day 0: Patient tests positive for COVID -19 via nasal swab  which is identified through 
Epic and is given information about the trial  via telephone call . At that time, they may 
determine whether or not they would like to be enrolled in  the study. Those enrolled in 
the study will be randomly assigned into one of 3 groups (control, intervention 1, 
intervention 2) using REDCap and delivered a package containing: n asal swabs with 
premeasured depth for insertion, saline rinse bottle with saline packets and detailed instruction guide (intervention 1, 2),  Johnson’s  Baby [CONTACT_255646]  ([COMPANY_012] Inc., 
New Brunswick, NJ) for use with saline rinses  (intervention 2), and symptom 
questionnaire /temperature sheet s.  
  
Days 1-21: Patients in intervention group 1 and 2 will perform nasal saline irrigations 
+/- ½ teaspoon of Johnson’s B aby [CONTACT_255647]. All 
patients wi ll perform nasal swabs every 2 -3 days (
See Instruction Sheet ). In the 
intervention arms, these swabs should be taken at least 4 hours after saline rinses are 
performed. Patients will also check temperature  (at same time  each day ) and fill out a 
symptom questionnaire  (See Symptom Quest ionna ire). At the completion of week 3, 
patients will call our team to collect swabs and questionnaire /temperature  sheet s. The 
paper questionnaires will be transferred to REDcap for data collection and analysis.  
 
*The timing of the study  is based on when patient initially tests positive for COVID -19 
and is a rolling enrollment rather than simultaneously performed.  
 Once 90 (~30 per group)  patients have completed their 21 days of swabs/temperature 
checks/questionnaires, the study trial will be completed and  data analysis will be 
performed. Interim analysis will be performed at 45 total  patients.   
 As these patients will be under quarantine for COVID -19 infection, they will receive and 
provide their swabs, tempera ture and symptom scoring sheets from thei r home add ress 
at the beginning and at  the conclusion of the 21-day study period . The swabs will be 
collected using OMR 110, DNA Genoteck Inc, Canada, that will immediately neutralize 
virus due to isotonic detergents present in the buffer, at the same time  stabiliz ing the 
DNA and RNA for further analysis.  Study administrators will wear appropriate personal 
protective equipment when retrieving the above -mentioned specimens.  
 
Laboratory and Analytic Methods  
qPCR Analysis to asses viral copy number: Viral RNA will be ex tracted using a standard 
Qiagen viral RNA isolation kit. After viral RNA extraction, qPCR will be utilized to analyze 
viral titers.  
 
SARS- CoV-2 Complete Genome Sequencing and analysis:  Viral RNA will be 
extracted using a standard Qiagen viral RN A isolation kit. We have established a high -
throughput CoV genome sequencing pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189], where we will perform overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_109916] -
range RT -PCR across the viral genome for each viral genome proposed in this project. 
Protocol Version #: 001   8 
Protocol Date: March 30, 2020  The sequencing will be performed using the Il lumina MiSeq platforms. We will 1) 
generate the long -range amplicons; 2) create libraries; 3) perform high -throughput 
sequencing; 4) deconvolve and assemble sequencing reads; 5) close genomes using the 
appropriate finishing methods ; and 6) submit the assembled seque nce files and 
metadata to NCBI. We will apply phylodynamic analyses that are being developed as 
part of our analytic pi[INVESTIGATOR_255636] a comprehensive study of SARS- CoV-2 evolutionary 
dynamics. Genome sequences from these samples will allow us to assess the evolution 
and extent of co -circulation of the different SARS- CoV-2 subgroups; we will also assess 
whether there are genetic associations with different clinical signs and symptoms of 
disease severity using the vast amount of clinical metadata that are bein g collected. 
Because all sequence information will be made publicly available, this data will be of use 
for the entire SARS- CoV-2 research community and will serve as references for viral 
diversity for all subsequent studies in this field.  
 16S S equencing for microbiome analysis: DNA/RNA isolation and 16S sequencing 
will be conducted as described before (2, 3) . Microbial sequence data will be evaluated 
in the context of SARS- CoV-2 infection status to deter mine taxon omic profiles and their 
distributions within and between samples, including taxonomic classification and 
abundance, clustering, and measures of within sample (alpha diversity) and between 
sample (beta diversity) variation  (4). Our goal is also to apply hypothesis testing for 
differences in community structure using multivariate statistics such as non -parametric 
multivariate analysis of variance (NP -MANOVA) an d to estimate the significance of 
changes in the diversity, intragroup variation, and specific proportions of taxonomic 
classifications and OTUs. We will determine if specific microorganisms correlate with 
viral SNPs, disease severity, and/or hos t gene exp ression, especially genes important to 
innate immune response.  
 Metatranscriptomics Sequencing: To simultaneously sequence the viral, host, and 
microbial transcriptomes,  RNA-seq libraries will be created from total RNA extracted 
from NP and orop haryngeal swabs and treated to remove all ribosomal RNA (Ribo -
Zero
TM, Epi[CONTACT_82064]). Forty -eight samples will be multiplex per lane on an Illumina 
NovaSeq V4 sequencing lane to producing ~10GB of 150- bp paired -end reads/sample. 
Based on our current experience  with de novo metatranscriptomics assembly, we favor 
Trinity assembly software (5) for this project because it consistently predicted the 
longest and fewest number of contigs and had the highest rate of ORFs that align to 
known genes. Transcripts will be mapped onto risk -active genomes and their relative 
abundance determined from the various samples and time points. To validate RNA-seq 
data, we will perform qRT -PCR on selected genes that show specific differential 
expression patterns. Transcripts that correlate with host and microbiome responses in 
the samples selected for RNA -seq will be investigated across the entire sample set using 
qRT-PCR. The innate immune response data will be validated by [CONTACT_255648].  
 
Data integration . We will interrogate the taxonomic composition of the URT 
microbiome across a wide range of donors (from adults vs. infants) for which we will 
know the genome sequence of the infecting v irus, the disease -severity phenotype, and 
the microbial diversity. These data will inform us as to the presence and relative 
abundance of key microbial species that reflect healthy versus disease states.

Protocol Date: March 30, [ADDRESS_310559] and 
the microbiome (i.e., both taxonomy and function), including potential changes in 
expression caused by [CONTACT_255649]. Correlations between biomarker diversity profiles (e.g., 16S) and functional profiles (RNA -seq), along with disease phenotypes 
and relevant patient metadata, will be identified using statistical approaches. Distance matrices will be computed among the phenotypes that are ordinal and matrix regressed in conjunction with the distance matrices between the samples. Significance and effect 
sizes of the regression coefficients will be reported. Multiple regression will then be performed with all the biomarker and RNA -seq data types simultaneously, using each -
omics distance matrix as a predictor variable  against the phenotype distance matrix as 
the response variable. The integration of these data will allow us to draw a more concrete pi[INVESTIGATOR_255637] -microbiome interactions, particularly as they relate to immune 
status and disease during SARS- CoV-2 infecti on. 
  
 
7.0 Risks 
 
Because of the reported risk of aerosolizing the virus  with rinses, no hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255638] y. Additionally, p atients in the study will be strictly 
directed to perform nasal saline irrigations in a separate bathroom/room in  their house  
to prevent exposure to household contacts . If they are unable to accommodate these 
instructions, they will be excluded/ removed from the trial. All patients who test positive 
for COVID -19 at VUMC are instructed to strictly self -quaran tine and i solate themselves 
from friends, family, and acquaintances. Therefore , the restrictions of this study are not 
a substantial imposition on the ability of patients to keep themselves and their families safe. 
 
There are reports of transient anosmia (loss of sm ell) in patients undergoing nasal saline 
irrigations with surfactant, though larger scale studies have not evaluated this and patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_255639].   
 
While an absolute percentage is unknown, estimates h ave report ed an average of [ADDRESS_310560] (CPAP) masks. Because of 
this risk, the FDA has recommended using boiled water (3- 5 minutes ) or water passed 
through a filter with an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller  (either purchased or 
filtered at home). Use of appropriately treated water in saline rinses renders the risk of 
infectious meningitis vanishingly small.  Johnson’ s Baby [CONTACT_255650] 0.[ADDRESS_310561] been 
noted in prior studies ( PMID:  17405780, 23710951

10.0  Statistical Considerations  
 
As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_255642] -19 patient 
population, a true power analysis i s not possible. Th is study will use a truncated initial 
sample size of 90 patients spread across 3 intervention arms to ensure that exclusion of 
true outliers is possible. Data will be analyzed with routine statistical software, with a 
planned 95% confiden ce interval for statistical testing.

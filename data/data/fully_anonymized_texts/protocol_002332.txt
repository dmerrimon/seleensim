1 Background Information and Scientific Ration ale 
Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is a coronavirus novel to the human 
population discovered in December 2019; it is currently the cause of a global pandemic [1 -3]. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) named the novel coronavir us severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 
2 (SARS -CoV-2) and the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV-2 coronavirus disease (COVID -19). As of 8 March 
2020, person -to-person transmission has occurred in China, across temperate Asia, Europe, and North 
America,  with sporadic cases in Africa and the southern hemisphere. Accurate reporting is limited by 
[CONTACT_46189]. The WHO declared the COVID -19 pandemic a Public Health Emergency 
of International Concern on 30 January 2020 [4].  Most deaths and severe pneumonitis have occurred in 
the elderly or in persons with underlying pulmonary or cardiac co -morbidities or diabetes. In more healthy 
adults, including pregnant women, it can cause a febrile, self -limited pneumonia. Infection appears less 
seve re in children and younger adults [5].  Nevertheless, the burden to health and economic systems 
globally of this pandemic is expected to be substantial. No acquired immunity to this novel viral infection 
appears to exist in the human population globally an d no effective treatment or preventative agent is 
licensed at this time.  
 
Over [ADDRESS_48773] been reported among health care workers  (HCWs)  caring for COVID -
19 patients in China, including 5 deaths, representing 3.8% of all COVID -19 patients  in a recently published 
series of over 72,000 cases [6]. The number of HCWs infected with SARS -CoV-2 are increasing every day 
in Italy and other countries.  
 
On 3 March 2020, WHO declared a global shortage of personal protective equipment  (PPE)  leaving do ctors, 
nurses and other frontline workers dangerously ill -equipped to care for COVID -19 patients [7].  By [CONTACT_46190] -CoV-[ADDRESS_48774] on COVID -19. 
 
As of today there is no approved treatment or prophylaxis for COVID -19 by [CONTACT_8415] (Food and Drug 
Administration). HCQ  is licensed for the chemoprophylaxis and treatment of malaria and as a disease 
modifying antirheumatic drug [8 -9]. It h as a long history of being safe and well tolerated at typi[INVESTIGATOR_46171]. 
HCQ has  antiviral activity  in vitro  against coronaviruses, and specifically Covid -19. Pharmacologic 
modelling based on observed drug levels and  in vitro  drug testing suggest that prophyla xis at approved 
doses could prevent Covid -19 infection and/or ameliorate viral shedding. Based on in vitro data that HCQ 
inhibits viral replication and limited observations reported from China HCQ has the potential for PrEP to 
prevent SARS -CoV-2 infection among HCWs  who are high risk of occupational exposure to SARS -CoV-2 
[10-12].

Version date:[ADDRESS_48775] udy is designed to answer whether 
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), HCQ , can mitigate the risk of SARS -CoV-2 infection among HCWs in 
high-risk setting.  
 
IND Exemption:  
• HCQ is lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002].  
• The investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well -controlled study in support of a 
new indication and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant change in the labeling 
of the drug.   
• In the case of a prescription drug, the investigation is not intended to suppor t a significant change 
in the advertising for the drug.  
• The investigation does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or other factor 
that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk) associated wi th the 
use of the drug product (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)).   
• The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by [CONTACT_2717] (21 CFR 
part 56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50)  
• The investigation is conduct ed in compliance with the requirements of § 312.7 (i.e., the investigation 
is not intended to promote or commercialize the drug product).  
 
2 Potential Risks & Benefits  
2.[ADDRESS_48776] to see in 1 -2% of 
the subject population is mild, self -limited drug reaction presenting as skin rash.  More rarely, the drug has 
been associated with Stevens -Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_46172] s, therefore subjects who 
experience rash will be asked to discontinue HCQ. Additionally, dyspepsia may be encountered with drug 
administration – not ulcer ogenic.  This tends to be mild and self -limiting. The drug can be taken with food.  
Recommendation to  subjects is to avoid antacids and cimetidine  as they reduce bioavailability. Alternatives 
include proton pump inhibitors and histamine 2 b lockers.  
 
Risk of study procedures  
Risks of DBS include temporary discomfort, bleeding, bruising, and rarely infectio n. The risk of infection will 
be minimized by [CONTACT_46191].  
 
Study Population:  The PrEP Study eligibility is high risk HCWs (eg MD /DO, NP, RN, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_46173] -19 units) at Tisch/Kimmel, Bklyn and Winthrop  meeting all inclusion criteria.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Vulnerable Subjects  
This study will enroll employees of NYU LH. Employees (For example: MD/DO, NP, RN, PA, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_46176]), residents, fellows and students recruited as research subjects are more vulnerable to undue 
influence or coercion because of the possibility that they may perceive employment or other benefits as 
dependent upon their participation in research. In addition, NYULHS employees may experience increased 
risk of invasion of privacy or loss of confidentiality.  To minimize these risks, employees will be allowed to 
self-identify as interested in being contact [CONTACT_46192]. Employees may then reach out to the research team  to learn more about 
the study and if enrolled (if employee elects to participate), informed consent will be  performed by a study 
team member with no direct supervisory or evaluation responsibilities. Additionally, at time of enrollment, 
the study team member will emphasize that participation is voluntary and refusal to participate will not affect

4.7.2  Dosing and Administration (applies only to Group A)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Rationale  
Hydroxychloroquine is a long -acting drug (elimination half -life:50 days).   Loading dose of  HCQ  600 mg  has 
been administered  for rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, with a usual maintenance 
dose 200 mg. Since the  protocol will be used in HCWs with at high risk of exposure to SARS -CoV-2, the 
intent is to  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_46179]. For this study, we selected a loading dose  of 600 mg  on 
day one  followed by 200 mg for maintenance dose  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Administration  
• Load ing dose: 600 mg, oral, 1 day  
• Maintenance dose: 200 mg, oral, daily, for 90 days  
The study will follow the study agent’s labeling guidelines except the dosing schedule selected as described 
above.  
 
If participants are already taking HCQ prior to enrolling into the study, patients will continuing their dosing 
schedule as prescribed (200mg per day). We will screen these subjects to document their reason for taking 
HCQ (i.e clinically indicated for lupus, persons who elected to take HCQ off -label). T hese subjects will be 
included into Group A, but their data will not be incorporated into the analysis for primary endpoint.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Supplies  
HCQ will be dispensed at outpatient or inpatient pharmacies of NYULH  at no cost  to the participants.  
Dispense schedules  
• 33 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]  (200 mg oral tablet)  at enrollment  
• 30 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (200 mg oral tablet) at 30 and 60 day  visit

5.1.1  Study Specific Procedures  
Questionnaires (Attachment A, B, C,D,E, F ) 
Participants from both Group A and B will be asked to complete the following questionnaires . 
• Attachment A - Pre - Screening questionnaire  (paper format)  
• Attachment B - Demographic/Employment Questionnaire  (paper format)  
• Attachment C  - Medication  Questionnaire for Group A  
• Attachment D – Medication Questionnaire for Group B  
• Attachment E - Symptoms Questionnaire  
• Attachment F  - Medical History Questionnaire  (paper format)  
 
Confirmation of Pregnancy in Women of Childbearing Potential: We will document in subject’s research 
record whether they are pregnant based on self -report and date of last menses (at Screening and follow -
up visits)  
 
Dried Blood Spots  
Kits will either be mailed to participants or be distributed in specific locations within Tisch/Kimmel, B rooklyn 
and Winthrop  locations.  Collection kit will include supplies to collect a DBS, instructions to collect, and store 
the sample  until ready for drop off . DBS collection  and storage  supplies will include alcohol pad s, lancet s, 
gauze,  collection card s, desiccant packets, and sealable foil bags for storage . Participants will be instructed 
to use a lancet to prick their fingertip, apply blood spot to the collection card , air dry the card, and store it in 
a foil bag containing desiccant packets . Samples will be returned via designated drop off locations at each 
of the participating NYULH facilities. Participants will be instructed to collect DBS sample on the same time 
of questionnaires.  
 
Chart review  
Chart review will be done after participant sign e -consent form. Data will be collected from participant’s 
EPIC medical chart review , including Occupational Health encounters associated with COVID -19.  Data 
collection will be include information related to  the diagnosis of  SARS -CoV-2 infection  and COVID -19 
disease. This may include data relating to demographics or other medical conditions that are suspected or 
known to be risk factors for  SARS -CoV-2 infection and/or modulate COVID -19 disease sever ity (including 
but not limited to diagnosis of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], inclusive of COVID -19, pneumonia, etc) . 
5.1.2  Specimen Preparation, Handling, and Storage  
DBS samples will be initially sent to the CTSI. Upon receipt, the CTSI will check the Symptom Questionna ire 
to label each sample as from a symptomatic or symptomatic participant. All samples will be routed to 
laboratories that are under biosafety level 2 conditions (BSL -2) for initial processing.  
Both samples from participants with and without symptoms will undergoing an initial, brief processing check 
under BSL -[ADDRESS_48784] is appropriately labeled and completed, and re -seal the specimen 
in an individual container labeled with the symptom status of the participant containing desiccant packs. 
The re -sealed specimen container will then be frozen for storage until elution for the intended experiments 
is ready to occur at BSL -2 conditions in a la boratory secured by [CONTACT_46193]/or passcode access 
provided samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic participants are appropriately labeled and stored in 
separate containers. This may occur at either the NYULVC processing lab located on the 4th floor of the

5.3  Laboratory Procedures/Evaluations  
 
Dried blood spot samples collected in this study will be used for serological testing. If sufficient sample 
remains after the primary and secondary objectives are completed, dried blood spot samples may be used 
to evaluate for the ability of non -SARS -CoV-2 coronavirus antibodies to cause antibody dependent 
enhancemen t of a pseudotyped virus expressing SARS -CoV-2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_46181].  
6 Assessment of Safety  
Participants will be asked about any pot ential side effects experiencing during study period.  
6.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_46194]. All recorded AE’s will have a severity grade as well as causality 
(related or not related to Hydroxychloroquine) as determined by [CONTACT_093].  
6.2 Definition of Serious Adverse  Events (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:    
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening

Version date:30 Mar 2020   COVID -19 PrEP HCW HCQ Study  • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46182])  
6.3 Classification of a n Adverse Event  (AE) 
6.3.1  Severity of Event  
For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily  
activities.  
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require sys temic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  
6.3.2  Relationship to Study Agent  
The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study agent (drug, biologic, device) is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there 
is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. All AEs must 
have their relationship to study agent ass essed. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be 
suspect. To help assess, the following guidelines are used.  
 
• Related – The AE is known to occur with the study agent, there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study agent caused the AE, or ther e is a temporal relationship between the study agent and 
event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the study agent and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administra tion of the study agent 
caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study agent and event onset, or 
an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
6.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate CRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, relationship to study produ ct (assessed only by [CONTACT_12213] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on 
study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship.  
 
Any medical condition that i s present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE  and all AEs  will be recor ded in the data collection system 
throughout the study.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentat ion of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].

Data Safety Monitoring Plan: The PI’s H. Michael Belmont and Vanessa Raabe will be monitoring the 
subjects in real time for adverse events. Accumulated data and adverse events will be reviewed at [ADDRESS_48791] 20 subjects are enrolled, then after 
the next 50 and then in increments of 50 thereafter.  If there is an unanticipated safety signal, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_46184]. A summary of the outcomes of these reviews will be submitted to the IRB.  
7 Statistical Considerations  
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans (SAP)  
All data will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics, including mean, median, standard 
deviation, and range for continuous vari ables and frequency and proportions for categorical variables. Data 
will also be summarized graphically.

deviation, and range for continuous variables and frequency and proportions for categorical variables. Data 
will also be summarized graphically.  Distributional assumptions will be assess with suitable transformation 
conducted if indicated.  Sig nificance tests will use two -sided Type I error rate of 0.05.  
7.4.2  Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
The primary analysis will assess the outcomes of seroconversion to SARS -CoV-2 as a marker of SARS -
CoV-2 infection, comparing this outcome across grou ps defined by [CONTACT_46195]. 
Antibody titers will be measured to determine seroconversion, a binomial endpoint defined by a 
four-fold increase in antibody titers compared to baseline. Seroconversion will be defined as a 
binomial vari able (i.e., seroconversion or no seroconversion) and analyzed using Wilcoxon rank 
analysis. Additionally, descriptive analysis will be provided of the antibodies titer results, 
including geometric mean, median, standard deviation, and titer range. Potentia l confounders of 
the primary endpoint will be addressed by [CONTACT_46196], such 
as propensity score matching, and logistical regression to assess for confounding by 
[CONTACT_46197][INVESTIGATOR_46185] -CoV-2 infection.

Secondary endpoints include symptoms reported over time via questionnaires, as well as other clinical 
endpoints such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], ICU admission, and mortality.  These binary clinical outcome will 
be analyzed in a manner similar to that described above for the primary endpoint.  Symptoms will be

8 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in 
source documents.  Examples o f these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_46186], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm 
or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico -technical departments in volved in the clinical trial. It is acceptable to use case report form s 
(CRFs ) as source documents. If this is the case, it should be stated in this section what data will be 
collected on CRFs and what data will be collected from other sources.  
 
The study CRF is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF 
must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the 
procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the 
individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been 
made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter t he correct 
data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT 
ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial 
and date it.  
 
Access to study records wil l be limited to IRB -approved members of the study team. The investigator will 
permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201]/EC, government regulatory bodies, 
and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will 
ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic 
laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832].

and/or the ICH E6.  
9.[ADDRESS_48795]  
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be 
submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be 
obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amend ment to the protocol will require review and 
approval by [CONTACT_3484]. All changes to the consent form 
will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented participants 
need to  be re -consented.  
9.[ADDRESS_48796] link to the e -consent, as well as phone number. 
The study team member will be on the phone and reviewing the e -consent with the participant. The study 
team member will remain on the phone with the participant to answer any questions and address any 
concerns.  
 
The e -consent will describe  in detail the study agent, study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant and document ation of informed consent is required prior to starting intervention/administering 
study product. The subject will document their consent by [CONTACT_46198] e -consent in REDCap.  
 
Language in the e -consent  will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval.  IRB approval will be 
obtained prior to enrolling any study participants.  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study 
and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensiv e discussion of risks and possible 
benefits of participation will be provided to the participants and their families. Consent forms will be IRB -
approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the document. Designated study personnel 
will expl ain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. All participants 
will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and 
potential risks of the study and of their rights a s research participants. Participants will have the 
opportunity to carefully review the written consent form  via REDCap  and ask questions prior to e-signing. 
The participants should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think a bout it 
prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will e-sign the informed consent document prior to any 
procedures being done specifically for the study. The participants may withdraw consent at any time 
throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the  e-signed informed consent document will be given to the 
participants for their records. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_46199].  
 
Since this study will enroll NYULH employees, the study personnel will emphasize that participation in this 
research study is voluntary and that the participant’s employment status, job performance evaluation, and 
the quality of any medical care the participant receives will not be adversely effected if he/she declines to 
participate in the study.

signed subject authorization inf orming the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revo ke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period.  
 
Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_46200]. This confidentiality is 
extended to cover testing of biological samples and the clinical information relating to participants. 
Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in 
strict confidence.  All study data will be stored in REDCap database.  Participant electronic material are 
only labeled with study ID and the link to identifiable info is sto red separately.  
 
Representatives of the IRB may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_1275], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1  Rationale for sulforaphane as a chemopreventive agent for lung cancer  
 
Lung cancer is leading cause of lung cancer death in both men and women worldwide 
(1.5 million deaths) and in the US (158,000 deaths) (2,3).  Cigarette smoking causes 
90% of lung cancer (4).  Smoking cessation is an obvious and practical strategy for 
lung cancer prevention for smokers.  The smoking cessation programs and 
antismoking campaign have resulted in significant reduction in prevalence of 
cigarette smoking in the US, from 60% in late  1960s to 17% in 2015; currently there 
are more former smokers than current smokers (5).  However, former smokers remain 
at high risk of lung cancer even after they quit smoking for many years (6). In fact, 
the majority of new lung cancer cases occur among former smokers (7,8). 
Unfortunately the preventive intervention for lung cancer targeting former smokers is 
lacking.  
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page [ADDRESS_333826] shown that intake of isothiocynantes (ITCs), natural 
products formed from glucosinolates found in certain cruciferous vegetables such as 
broccoli and its seeds, are associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer.  Using a 
valida ted biomarker approach (9,10), we, for the first time, demonstrated that high 
urinary total ITCs, including both sulforaphane (SF) and phenethyl isothiocyanate 
(PEITC), were associated significantly with a 35% reduced risk of lung cancer (11).  
These novel findings stimulated many epi[INVESTIGATOR_273348].  A meta -analysis including 14 studies and more than 8,000 lung 
cancer c ases reported a statistically significant 20% reduced risk of lung cancer for 
subjects with high intake of cruciferous vegetables (12).  These data implicate a 
protective role of ITCs or cruciferous vegetables as a whole against the development 
of lung cancer in humans. However, epi[INVESTIGATOR_273349], thus the observed asso ciation between 
ITCs and lung cancer risk may not be causal. Furthermore, results from observational 
studies usually do not provide a biological underpi[INVESTIGATOR_334].  
 
Preclinical data in rodent models is quite persuasive for prevention of lung cancer 
with ITCs.  In an experiment by [CONTACT_273394]. (13), 160 rats were assigned to 4 groups: 
1) 60 rats treated by [CONTACT_7634] -specific lung carcinogen NNK (2 ppm) only, 2) 60 rats 
of NNK (2 ppm) plus PEITC (3 micromole/g diet), 3) 20 rats of PEITC (3 
micromole/g diet) only, and 4) 20 rats untreated as controls. P EITC was added to diet 
at a non -toxic concentration for the entire study period (112 weeks) whereas NNK 
was added to the drinking water one week after the initial administration of PEITC.  
At the end of the study (after 112 weeks of PEITC and 111 weeks of NNK treatment), 
70% of the NNK -treated only rats developed lung adenoma and adenocarcinoma 
while only 5% of rats treated with PEITC and NNK developed lung tumors, similar to 
those in the PEITC -treated only or untreated control rats.  These results showed t hat 
PEITC, treated concurrently with NNK, a setting analogous to the situation of current 
smokers who are continuously exposed to tobacco carcinogens including NNK, 
completely inhibited carcinogen -induced lung tumors in rats.  
 
In another experiment by [CONTACT_273395] (14) with a different study design, 
mice were treated with a mixture of tobacco carcinogens: 3 micromole 
benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] and [ADDRESS_333827], stopped carcinogen treatment for 12 weeks, and then fed a diet cont aining 
different concentrations of sulforaphane (SF) (1.5 or 3.0 micromole/g diet) or 
phenethy isothiocyanate (PEITC) (1.5 or 3.0 μmole/g diet), for 22 more weeks. At the 
end of the study, the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma was reduced by a statistically  
significant 52% in mice treated with carcinogens plus SF, and by 55% in mice treated 
with carcinogens plus PEITC, compared with mice treated with carcinogens only. 
The tumor multiplicity was reduced by 70% in mice treated with carcinogens plus SF 
and by 6 0% in mice treated with carcinogens plus PEITC.  These results show that 
both dietary SF and PEITC can inhibit the development of lung tumors induced by 
[CONTACT_273396] – B(a)P and NNK.  More importantly, the 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page 7 of 55 chemopreventive agents SF and PEITC were given 12 weeks after the carcinogen 
treatment was stopped, a setting analogous to a situation of exposure for former 
smokers.  
 
Besides the inhibition of tumor  incidence and multiplicity, both SF and PEITC can 
inhibit cellular proliferation markers such as Ki -67 and induction of apoptosis (15), 
hallmarks of tumorigenesis.  In the experiment by [CONTACT_273395] (14), dietary 
intake of SF (1.5 micromole/g diet) reduced number of lung cells expressing 
proliferative cell nuclear antigen, an alternative to Ki -67, by 61% (from 44.4 ± 1.9 to 
17.3 ± 11.7) (14).  In a double -blinded randomized clinical trial, women with 
abnormal mammograms and scheduled for breast biopsy who consumed SF precursor 
GR supplement (estimated daily urinary excretion of 9.7 μmole total metabolites of 
SF) for 2 -8 weeks showed significa ntly reduced Ki -67 labeling indices (LI) in breast 
benign tissue (16).  Dietary SF and PEITC also induced markers of apoptosis in lung 
tissue of mice after treated with tobacco carcinogens. Compared with control animals, 
mice given SF (1.5 micromole/g diet) showed a statistically significant 6 -fold 
increase (from 4.7±1.9 to  29.3±4.7%) in activated caspase -3, and a 2 -fold increase 
(from 12.7±3.0 to 29.4±5.8%) in TUNEL (t erminal transferase dUTP nick end 
7labelling)  of lung cells  (14). 
 
We recently completed two randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled clinical 
trials. The first trial was led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kensler to evaluate whether intake of SF enhances 
the detoxification metabolism of environmental carcinogens and toxicants such as 
benz ene and acrolein in 283 subjects (89% were non -smokers) who were exposed to 
substantial levels of airborne pollutants in China.  Intake of a broccoli sprout -derived 
beverage providing daily doses of 600 micromole GR and 40 micromole SF for 12 
weeks signifi cantly increased the urinary excretion of the detoxification mercapturic 
acids formed from benzene, an environmental carcinogen present in both tobacco 
smoke and polluted air, by 61% (P<0.001) and acrolein by 23% (P=0.01) (17). The 
median levels of the 24 -hour urinary excretion of SF metabolites with this dosing 
regimen were 54 -62 micromole across the intervention period (17).  The second trial 
was led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yuan to evaluate if intake of PEITC inhibits the metabolic activation 
of tobacco -specific carcinogen NNK and enhances the detoxification metabolism of 
tobacco -nonspecific carcinogens and toxicants such as benzene and acro lein. Overall, 
intake of PEITC 40 mg/day for 5 days significantly inhibited NNK metabolic 
activation by 8% (P = 0.023), and increased urinary detoxification mercapturic acids 
formed from benzene by 25% ( P = 0.002) and acrolein by 15% ( P = 0.005), in [ADDRESS_333828] a very similar biological mechanism and share the strongly 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_273350], as shown in the animal experiment (14). 
 
These two randomized phase [ADDRESS_333829] of these ITCs on the metabolisms of tobacco -specific (NNK) 
and nonspecific carcinogens (benzene) and toxicants (acrolein) through specific 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page [ADDRESS_333830] been shown to be directly linked to the development of lung cancer (18). 
 
We propose to further evaluate the chemopreventive effect of SF against lung 
carcinogenesis through a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled phase 2 
clinical trial, a proof -of-principal study, with a longer treatment period (12 months) 
for former s mokers who are at high risk for lung cancer.  We hypothesize that intake 
of SF will improve pathological features of bronchial dysplasia, decrease cell 
proliferation and increase apoptosis in endobronchial biopsies, and improve the gene 
expression profile of lung cancer -related genes in endobronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], all of 
which have been shown to predict lung cancer development and diagnosis (18,19).  
Successful outcome of this systemic analysis is crucial to further develop SF as a 
chemopreventive agent for the primary prevention of lung cancer.  Our ultimate goal 
is to validate the efficacy of this readily available, widely accessible, inexpensive,  
natural compound as a primary chemopreventive agent against the development of 
lung cancer in humans.  
 
Findings from epi[INVESTIGATOR_273351] -
term randomized phase [ADDRESS_333831] lessons from failed large placebo -controlled phase 3 
chemoprevention trials when their premises were primarily based on the observed 
inverse association from epi[INVESTIGATOR_273352], but not by [CONTACT_273397] -clinical studies in animals and early phase randomized 
clinical trials in humans. These previously failed trials included CARET (beta -
carotene and retinol) and ATBC (beta -carotene and  alpha -tocopherol) (20,21)}. 
Therefore, direct evidence of a protective effect of SF on bronchial cellular and 
molecular biomarkers proposed here is crucial for further development of SF as a 
primary chemoprevention agent against the development of lung cancer in humans. 
The proposed study, if i t proves our hypotheses to be true, will have significant public 
health implications on reduction of lung cancer incidence and mortality in former 
smokers.  
2.2 Prior chemoprevention studies  
 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page [ADDRESS_333832], a prostacyclin analogue, in current and former smokers with sputum 
cytological atypia or endobronchial dysplasia (22). Bronchoscopy was performed at 
study entry and after completion of the six -months treatment. Within each subject, we 
calculated the average histological score of all biopsies, the worst biopsy score, and 
the dysplasia index. Compared with former smokers i n the placebo group, former 
smokers treated with oral iloprost exhibited a significantly greater improvement in 
average score (0.41 units better, P = 0.010), in the worst biopsy score (1.10 units 
better, P = 0.002), and in the dysplasia index ( -12.5%, 95% CI -21.0% to -3.9%, P = 
0.006). The [ADDRESS_333833] did not show any improvement of 
histological scores in current smokers (22). Endobronchial dysplasia is a presumed 
precursor of non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In a follow -up study of a high -risk 
cohort of subjects with endoscopic biopsies, persistence of bronchial dysplasia was 
associated significantly with a 7 -fold increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_253543] (adjusted 
hazard ratio = 7.8, 95% CI 1.6 -39.4). Furthermore, e levated Ki -67 LI at baseline 
endobronchial biopsies were associated significantly with increased bronchial 
dysplasia score, which predates the development of lung cancer (18). 
 
Another similar phase 2 clinical trial was the celecoxib trial conducted by [CONTACT_273398] (23). The study enrolled former smokers (age ≥45 years, ≥30 pack -years 
of smoking, ≥1 year of sustained abstinence from smoking) to evaluate the impact of 
COX -2 selective inhibitor celecoxib on cellular and molecular events associated with 
lung cancer pathogen esis. The primary endpoint was bronchial Ki -67 LI after 6 
month treatment. Celecoxib significantly reduced Ki -67 LI by [CONTACT_5554] 34% (P = 
0.04). Furthermore the decrease in Ki -67 LI correlated with a reduction and/or 
resolution of lung nodules on CT (P  = 0.008).   
 
Although both iloprost and celecoxib have shown effective on the reduced regression 
of bronchial dysplasia in former smokers (22-24), both are not available for further 
development as potential chemopreventive agents due to their toxicity (celecoxib) or 
lack of readily deliverable form such as tablets (iloprost). Sulforaphane is a promising 
chemopreventive agent, a natural compound wit h minimal side effects, readily 
available, widely accessible, and inexpensive for mass production.  Smaller trials with 
intermediate endpoints in high -risk subjects are needed to provide crucial data for 
further development of SF as a primary chemoprevention agent against the 
development of lung cancer in humans. The proposed study, if it proves our 
hypotheses to be true, will have significant public health implications on reduction of 
lung cancer incidence and mortality in former smokers.

4. STUDY AGENT INFORMATION  
 
4.1 Broccoli seed preparations (BSP)  
 
4.1.1  Summary  
 
Broccoli seed preparations (BSP) have been studied extensively in multiple Phase I 
and Phase II clinical trials without Grade 2 or higher adverse effects. Broccoli seeds 
contain high concentrations of glucoraphanin (GR), the glucosinolate precursor of 
sulforaphane (SF), which is converted to SF by [CONTACT_273400] 
(25-27). The isothiocyanate SF (1 -isothiocyanato -4R-(methylsulfinyl)butane) was 
originally isolated from commercial broccoli, and is one of the most potent naturally -
occurring inducers of cytoprotective enzymes identified to date (28). SF activates the 
KEAP1 -NRF2 signaling pathway, thereby [CONTACT_273401]. For example, SF has been shown to induce cytoprotective 
enzymes in a variety of animal and human cell lines and tissues (29). 
 
In our initial clinical trials, we investigated BSP in the form of re -hydrated, 
previously lyophilized broccoli sprout powders rich in either GR or SF produced by 
[CONTACT_273402]. 
Jed Fahey a nd Paul Talalay.  Broccoli sprouts ( Brassica oleracea ) were grown from 
specially selected BroccoSprouts ™ seeds to provide a consistent yield of GR or SF. 
In our initial trial, the GR -rich powder was considered as a food by [CONTACT_273403]. It is simp ly the freeze -dried powder derived from a hot water extract of 
broccoli sprouts. In 2010, the US FDA made a determination that beverages 
containing SF -rich broccoli sprout powders (but not GR -rich broccoli sprout 
powders) must be considered as drugs becaus e the SF is formed ex vivo from the 
plant by [CONTACT_273404] -containing daikon seeds during the preparation of 
the SF -rich powder. Thus, subsequent trials in Qidong, China ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) as 
well as the pi[INVESTIGATOR_273354] (NCT 02023931) have been 
conducted with an IND from the FDA (#112038) held by [CONTACT_273405] (Co -
I).   
 
There are three main problems in achieving consistent delivery and bioavailability of 
active SF by [CONTACT_273406]: (1) SF is only moderately 
storage - and heat -stable over time, especially in aqueous solution.  (2) SF -rich 
broccoli sprout extract powders are extremely hygroscopic and the preparation of 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page 13 of 55 capsules containing accurate doses by [CONTACT_273407]. (3)  
Administration of GR as an oral precursor of SF results in highly variable 
conversions of GR to SF metabolites (dithiocarbamates) among individuals, ranging 
from 1 – 40%, but fairly consistent between individuals (17,27,30-32).  
 
In this study in healthy former smokers, BSP will be provided in the form of the 
commercially available dietary supplement, Avmacol®. Although a number of 
dietary supplements containing GR have been available in the U.S. market for several 
years now, Avmac ol® is the first commercial product to contain GR plus the fully 
active enzyme myrosinase, thus yielding a higher and much more consistent SF dose 
upon ingestion. Avmacol ® tablets contain only GR -rich broccoli seed extract, freeze -
dried broccoli sprouts fo r the myrosinase source, and the inert excipi[INVESTIGATOR_273355] a tablet. They are manufactured by [CONTACT_273408], Inc. (Edgewood, 
Maryland, [LOCATION_003]).  Avmacol ® has been sold as a nutritional supplement in the United 
States since 2013, and is manufactured under GMP standards, which has a shelf life 
of two years at ambient temperature. Based on previous human studies with both 
dietary and topi[INVESTIGATOR_273356], and related broccoli seed preparations, 
and the absence of severe or serious risk s (no Grade II toxicities have been observed 
in > 500 patients)  (see Table 3 in Clincal Protocol) , we do not anticipate serious 
adverse events to be associated with the administration of Avmacol® to study 
participants in this proposed trial.  
 
4.1.2.  Description of Origin of Sulforaphane, Purification, and Stabilization  
 
Sulforaphane (SF) and its precursor GR are naturally occurring substances 
(phytochemicals) found in cruciferous vegetables.  For many years now, the only 
reliable source of SF for clinical trials was our own broccoli sprout extract 
preparation.  Whereas gl ucoraphanin has in recent years been made available in the 
supplement market by a number of manufacturers, SF has continued to elude 
commercialization.  Now, with the introduction of Avmacol ® to the dietary 
supplement market, a vetted, stable source of SF is available to clinical trial 
participants, and could be purchased by [CONTACT_273409], even after their 
involvement in clinical studies ends.  This is something that has not been possible 
with previous SF -rich broccoli sprout extract preparations.  
 
The biologically active phytochemical in Avmacol ® is glucoraphanin (GR; 4 -
methylsulfinylbutyl -glucosinolate), the precursor of sulforaphane (1 -isothiocyanato -
(4R)-(methylsulfinyl)butane). Sulforaphane (SF) is the aglycone breakdown product 
of the GR. The molecular formula of SF is C 6H11NOS 2, and its molecular weight is 
177.29 daltons. The structural formulae of GR and SF are shown in Figure 1 . After 
ingestion and absorption, SF is conjugated with glutathione by [CONTACT_159441] -S-
transferases (GSTs), then metabo lized sequentially by -glutamyltranspeptidase 
(GTP), cysteinylglycinase (Cgase), and N- acetyltransferase (NAT) to form 
mercapturic acids, the predominant metabolites of SF found in urine ( Figure 2 ) 
(26,27,31).

Sulforaphane conjugates quickly accumulate in various types of cells in culture, 
reaching intracellular concentrations in the millimolar (mM) range (33). Intracellular 
accumulation is achieved through conjugation with cellular glutathione (34), a 
reaction that is accelerated by [CONTACT_159441] S-transferases (35), and the glutathione 
conjugate is then exported by a transporter -mediated mechanism (36). SF activates 
the Nrf -[ADDRESS_333844] resulting in elevated gene transcription via the Antioxidant -
Response Element in the regulatory domain of its target genes (28). 
4.1.3 Physical, Chemical, and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulations  
The active ingredient in Avmacol ® (as in broccoli sprout extracts) is glucoraphanin 
(GR; 4 -methylsulfinylbutyl -glucosinolate).  The biologically active metabolite of this 
inert plant precursor, sulforaphane (SF; 1 -isothiocyanato -4R-(methylsulfinyl)butane) 
is formed by [CONTACT_273410]. SF conversion is maximized in broccoli 
sprout extracts through the addition of small amounts of 
myrosinase -containing daikon sprouts. Sulforaphane is an 
isothiocyanate. Its molecular formul a is C 6H11NOS 2, and its 
molecular weight is 177.29 daltons. The structural formula of SF 
is:

4.1.4  Non-Clinical Pharmacology  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics  
Analysis of the pharmacokinetics of oral SF was performed using male Fischer rats  
receiving a single 50 mol oral dose of SF. The average plasma concentrations of SF  
are illustrated in Figure 3 . The plasma concentration of SF increased very rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375],  
detectable at 1 h and peaking at 20.8 M, 4 h after dosing. SF displayed fairly rapid  
absorption and an elimination half -life of 2.23 h (1). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamics  
 
Effects on gene expression  
 
Hu et al.  investigated the effects of two oral doses of 50 mol of SF given at 0 and 24 
hours on gene expression profiles by [CONTACT_273411].  562 genes were found to be 2 -fold up - or down -regulated at one or more time 
points (2, 4, 12, 24, 48 hours) compared to control. The most robust induction was of 
the metallothionein -like genes (MT -1/2 and MT -1a), which are considered important 
antioxida nt genes, which increased up to [ADDRESS_333845] to time after a 50 µmol oral dose of 
SF in rats with three animals per time point.  Results are mean ± S.D. The curve is the fitted 
plasma concentrations to a one -compartmental model with first -order absorption using 
WinNonlin (1).

    Page 16 of 55 dose oral SF on selected cytochrome P450 genes were statistically significant with 
up-regulation of CYP 19, 3A3, 3A9, 1B1, 2B19, and 4B1 to 3.28 -, 2.88 -, 2.78 -, 2.49 -, 
2.04-, and 2.05 -times baseline, respectively. Cytochrome P450 2C29 and CYP1A1 
were lower ed to 20% and 72% of baseline levels, respectively (1). 
 
Comblatt  et al. investigated the effects of a single oral dose of 150 micromol of SF on 
gene and protein expression in Sprague Dawley rats. A maximal 12 -fold induction of 
NQO1  transcripts was observed in the mammary gland 12 h after dosing and there 
was significant induction as early as 2 h. A biphasic pattern of heme oxygenase -1 
(HO-1) transcript induction was observed, with an initial peak at 2 h followed by a 
subsequent peak at 12 h. The minimal time to statistically significant HO-1 induction 
was 1 h. A maximal  2.8-fold induction of NQO1 enzymatic activity in the mammary 
gland was observed 24 h after dosing with minimal time to statistically significant 
induction at 4 h (29). 
 
Effects on enzyme expression  
Murine studies of oral SF feeding have examined the effect on detoxication enzyme 
induction. When SF doses of 15 micromole (88.5 mg/kg/day) were administered to 
mice daily for 5 days by [CONTACT_206180], there was a 2.5 -fold increase in hepatic NQO1 
activity (37).  Another murine study of SF administered intragastrically at a dose of 
17 micromole (150 mg/kg/day) for 4 days showed 2.6 fold induction of mammary 
gland NQO1 activity, but hepatic levels of the enzyme were not significantly elevated 
(38).  When SF (50 mg/kg/Day) was given daily for 7 Days by [CONTACT_273412]1 activity increased significantly, but hepatic CYP 1A 
activity was not affected (37). Notably, no toxic effects were noted in these studies in 
which high doses of SF were administered.  
 
Yoxall et al. (39) performed studies with oral SF in male Wistar rats. Using doses of 
3 and 12 mg/kg daily for [ADDRESS_333846] was that activity of CYP1A2 was depressed. CYP2B expression decreased to 
85% of control only at the higher SF dose. CYP3A2 expression decreased to 80% of 
control with SF treatment only at the higher dose. CYP2E1 was  unaffected by [CONTACT_67307].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Non -clinical Metabolism  
 
Kassahun et al. (40) examined the biotransformation of SF in the rat by [CONTACT_17801] 
50 mg of SF per kg to male Sprague -Dawley rats. Bile and urine were subsequently 
collected. In bile, five thiol conjugates were detected including glutathione (GSH) 
conjugates of SF, erucin (the sulfide analog of SF), the N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 
conjugates of SF, and the GSH conjugate of a desaturated metabolite of SF, 
suggesting oxidative metabolism of the parent compound. Fecal metabolites were not 
identified. NAC conjugates of SF were detected in the urine. Quantitative ur ine

    Page 17 of 55 determinations indicated that 60% of a single dose of SF is eliminated in [ADDRESS_333847] by [CONTACT_273413].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non -clinical Toxicology  
 
A number of  animal studies have investigated the biological effects and toxicology of 
oral SF -containing broccoli seeds and SF itself. While these investigations have 
examined a wide variety of endpoints and effects, they have demonstrated the overall 
in vivo  safety and beneficial biological effects of broccoli seeds and SF. Animal 
studies are summarized below.  
 
Myzak et al. (41) treated C57BL mice with 6 micromol SF/Day for [ADDRESS_333848] on body weight, hematocrit, or spleen weight. Taking into account 
species scaling factors, human consumption of 106 g of broccoli seeds daily would 
achieve daily SF intake simila r to this murine study.  
Jones et al. (42) treated male F344 rats with SF 50 mg/kg/Day (280 micromol / kg / 
Day) by [CONTACT_273414]. The dose was selected based on reports of non -toxicity 
and efficacy in inducing cytoprotective enzymes in other model systems. During the 
study [ADDRESS_333849] the 
relative weights of the prostate, kidneys, liver or bladder. Body weight was not 
affected compared to control animals, though there was an 8% decrease in body 
weight in the SF treated group compared to i nitial weight. The SF dose used in this 
study is >10 -times greater than that achieved by [CONTACT_273415].  
Zhang et al. (43) treated female Sprague -Dawley rats with BSP to study the effect on 
tissue GST and NQO1 and the urinary excretion levels of isothiocyanate (ITC) 
metabolites. These experiments included administration of BSP providing 40, 80, and 
160 micromol isothiocyanate /kg body weight daily for [ADDRESS_333850].

4.1.5  Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Broccoli Seed Preparations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Broccoli Sprout Extracts  
Ye et al.  (44) conducted a human study with broccoli sprout extracts to provide 
information on plasma, serum, and erythrocyte concentrations of isothiocyanates (ITC) 
after ingestion of metered doses of ITC. Four healthy male human subjects were fed 
single doses of a SF -rich extract made from sprouted broccoli seeds, in which the 
glucosinolates had been hydrolyzed by [CONTACT_273419], i.e. GR to SF. Cyclocondensation assays were performed on two 
occasions to verify the dose: first at the time of dose preparation and second near the time 
of feeding, with the two analyses within <5% agreement. The four subjects were fed a 
single dose of myrosinase -hydrolyzed extract of sprouted broccoli seeds containing 200 
mol of ITC (77% SF). Maximum urin ary excretion rate of ITC and dithiocarbamates 
(DTC) metabolites of ITC, was attained between [ADDRESS_333852]. The cumulative 8 hour urinary excretion of the 
DTCs averaged 58.3  2.8% of the dose. 72 hours after consumption, urinary excretion 
totaled 77.9  6.4 % of the dose, suggesting the isothiocyanates did not react irreversibly 
with proteins or other macromolecules, but were rapi[INVESTIGATOR_273358]. The plasma and erythro cyte concentrations and urinary excretion rates 
plotted in Figure 4  show that the pharmacokinetic behavior of the ITC was very similar 
in all 4 human subjects. ITC/DTC levels were detected in plasma/erythrocytes 15 
minutes after dosing and the concentration rose to a maximum in the 1 hr sample of all 
subjects with a mean maximum of 2.00  0.30 mol/l; range: 1.62 – 2.27 micromol /l. 
Between 2 and 6 hours after dosing, plasma concentrations of ITC/DTC declined with 
first-order kinetics with a mean half -life of 1.77  0.13 hours. The calculated renal 
clearance is 369  53 ml/min, which is more than double the glomerular filtration rate for 
the subjects, suggesting tubular secretion plays a major role in the elimination process. 
The bioavailability of SF in humans is believed to be 60 -90%. From these data, an 
apparent vo lume of distribution is 59.9  7.0 liters which is consistent with ITC/DTC 
distribution in total body water (27,44). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_273359] -life, it is believed 
that SF has a longer duration of action since most of the induced phase [ADDRESS_333853] 
half-lives measured in days. Thus, a high cellular concentration need not be maintained 
continuously (45).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Broccoli  sprout extract without daikon  
 
We conducted a randomized, Phase Iia human study enrolling [ADDRESS_333854] of sprouted 
broccoli seeds (“tea”) containing 400 mol GR or placebo nightly for 2 weeks in an 
attempt to modulate carcinogen markers. Subjects were followed clinically for 
compliance and adverse events. Serum ALT and urinary dithiocarbamate (DTC) 
levels were assessed. DTC elimination varied up to 3 -fold b etween participants but 
was consistent between doses within an individual, suggesting bioavailability of 
active isothiocyanates (SF) was variable among the population. Importantly, the GR 
in the extract was not treated with myrosinase and thus relied upon enteric bacterial 
flora for conversion to SF. Thus, the inve stigators speculate that differences in 
individual gastrointestinal flora may account for the variability. The broccoli seed tea 
was well tolerated.  All [ADDRESS_333855] of foodborne and airborne toxicants

[IP_ADDRESS]  Broccoli sprout extract with daikon  
 
Egner et al. conducted a cross -over clinical trial in Qidong, China in 2009 to compare 
the bioavailability and tolerability of SF from beverages made with two sprouted 
broccoli seed powders: one glucoraphanin -rich (GR -rich) powder and the other 
sulforaphan e-rich (SF -rich) powder. SF was either generated in vivo  from the GR 
contained in the GR -rich powder by [CONTACT_273420]-rich powder with myrosinase from daikon ( Raphanus sativus ) seeds to generate 
SF-rich powder. Fifty h ealthy, eligible participants were requested to refrain from 
crucifer consumption and randomized into two treatment arms. The study design was

    Page 20 of 55 as follows: 5 -Day run -in period, 7 -Day administration of beverages, 5 -Day washout 
period, and 7 -Day administration of the opposite intervention. Isotope dilution mass 
spectrometry was used to measure levels of GR, SF and SF thiol conjugates in urine 
sample s collected daily throughout the study. Bioavailability, as measured by [CONTACT_273421] (in approximately 12 hour collections after 
dosing), was substantially greater with the SF (mean = 70%) than with GR -rich 
(mean = 5%) bevera ges. The primary urinary metabolite of following administration 
of either GR -rich or SF -rich powder was the acetylcysteine conjugate of SF.  Inter -
individual variability in excretion was considerably lower with the SF -rich than GR -
rich beverage. Eliminatio n rates were considerably slower with GR -rich beverages 
allowing for achievement of steady state dosing as opposed to bolus dosing with SF -
rich beverages. Results from this trial led us to consider blends of SF and GR as SF -
rich and GR -rich mixtures to ach ieve peak concentrations for activation of some 
targets and prolonged inhibition of others implicated in the protective actions of SF. 
The Avmacol® to be administered during this trial follows this pharmacokinetic 
principle, as the bioactive ingredients in clude broccoli seed powder, containing both 
GR and myrosinase which is responsible for consistent in vivo delivery of 40% of the 
GR content as SF (46). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cruciferous Vegetables  
 
Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_70040].  conducted human studies on DTC excretion after cruciferous vegetable 
ingestion. Four healthy male volunteers were fed 250 grams of a cruciferous 
vegetable. Isothiocyanate levels were measured in each vegetable administered and 
contained 0.3 – 0.8 mol/g fresh weight. Thus ITC dosing ranged from 75 – [ADDRESS_333856] 8 -h collecti on, was  80% complete in 24 h and returned to baseline by 72 
h after dosing (27). 
 
Lastly, Fowke et al.  conducted an interventional trial in women over the age of 45 
years. Participants attended a series of classes designed to facilitate the addition of 
cruciferous vegetables to the daily diet. Urine collection for ITC concentration was 
performed at baselin e and during the 4 -week intervention phase. The amount (grams) 
of cruciferous vegetables ingested was recorded during the baseline and intervention 
period. During the 4 -week intervention phase, subjects consumed an average of 196 
grams of cruciferous vegetables per Day (range 53 -371 g). Group -average ITC 
excretion levels in urine followed the trend of vegetable intake with significant 
increases from Baseline to Intervention (P < 0.01) and a decrease from the 
Intervention to Post -interven tion phase of the study (P <0.01). No adverse reactions 
related to the dietary intervention were reported (47). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Broccoli preparations containing active myrosinase.  
 
The bioavailability of a simple powder made by [CONTACT_273422] a boiling water extract 
of GR -rich broccoli sprouts (broccoli sprout extract; myrosinase de -activated by 
[CONTACT_273423]), was compared with a variety of preparations containing

    Page 21 of 55 active myrosinase (BSdP - broccoli seed powder; BsdE - commercially prepared 
broccoli seed boiling water extracts that are spray -dried; FDBS - freeze -dried 
broccoli sprouts).  Multiple sample matrices and modes of delivery showed that 
regardless of deliver y method, providing active myrosinase as part of the preparation 
enhanced the bioavailability of SF and reduced the variability of conversion (GR to 
SF) which can be ascribed solely to the gut microbiota.  Mean bioavailability of GR 
preparations lacking ac tive myrosinase, as we have shown in previous studies, was 
roughly 10% of dose, whereas when active myrosinase was included in the dose, 
bioavailability increased to about 40%, see Table [ADDRESS_333857] variability was also reduced, and when hydrolysis was accomplished 
ex-vivo, prior to dosing, bioavailability was closer to 90% (48).

4.1.6  Safety and Efficacy  
 
Cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli seeds and broccoli seed sprouts, are 
generally regarded as safe and are regular dietary components in many regions of the 
world. Previous estimates of the daily dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables vary 
region ally, averaging 40 g/Day in Singapore (49), 11 g/Day in the [LOCATION_002] (50), 
16 g/Day in Canada (51), 30 g/Day in the [LOCATION_006] (52), and 112 g/Day in Japan (53).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Broccoli Sprout  
 
A number of small pi[INVESTIGATOR_273360]:   
 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page 23 of 55 Murashima and colleagues reported in 2004 on the elevation of multiple biomarkers 
of oxidative stress following a one -week course (6 young male and 6 young female 
smokers) of 100 g/d of fresh broccoli sprouts (54). Plasma markers were measured 
before and after treatment. Treatment produced decreases in serum total cholesterol, 
LDL cholesterol, coenzyme Q 10, plasma 23 harmaco and phosphatidylcholine 
hydroperoxide, and urinary 8 -isoprostane, and 8 -OhdG. Increases in CoQ 10H2/CoQ [ADDRESS_333861], ALT, γ -GPT, and plasma 
amino acids were also measured and there were no before - to after -treatment 
differenc es in any of these biomarkers.  
 
In 2009, a group at UCLA reported on the ability of orally administered broccoli 
sprout homogenates (BSH) to increase phase [ADDRESS_333862] (55). After feeding 57 subjects doses of BSH ranging from 25 to 200 grams on 
3 separate days, followed on the 4th day by [CONTACT_273425], there 
was a dramatic and dose -dependent increase in phase 2 enzyme expression (mRNA 
for GSTM1, GSTP1, HO -1, and NQO1). Induction of individual phase 2 enzymes in 
nasal lavage cells was strongly correlated. No seri ous adverse events were reported, 
and dose intolerance or side effects of broccoli sprouts were not observed, and mild, 
digestive effects are presented in the report.   
 
Christiansen et al. (56) report that ingestion of broccoli sprouts does not improve 
endothelial function in human beings with hypertension (n = 40 hypertensive, non -
diabetic subjects with cholesterol in the normal range). Subjects were fed 10 g of 
dried broccoli sprouts for 4 wee ks, and their blood pressure, endothelial function 
(measured by [CONTACT_1603] -mediated dilation), and blood samples were obtained every other 
week. Glucoraphanin content of the sprouts was measured, and equated to a dose of 
259 µmol GR/day – a reasonable level, but  in light of our findings perhaps not high 
enough to expect a measurable effect due to low conversion of GR to SF by [CONTACT_273426].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Broccoli Sprout Preparations (BSPs) and Extracts (BSEs)  
 
Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_70040]. (31) conducted a double -blind, placebo controlled, randomized, Phase I 
study of two BSPs, beverages containing SF -rich or GR -rich powder made from 
sprouted broccoli seeds, in healthy individuals to determine the safety and tolerance 
of repeated oral administra tion. Twelve healthy human  volunteers received doses of 
BSP every 8 hours for 7 Days (total 21 doses) while undergoing clinical evaluation 
and a battery of laboratory tests. Doses used in 3 cohorts of 3 subjects and 1 control 
were 25 mol glucosinolates, 100 mol glucosinolates, and 25 mol isothiocyanates, 
respectively. Thus subjects received 75 – [ADDRESS_333863] to laboratory testing, samples were obtained 6 
times during the 19 Day study and included evalu ation of the blood for the following: 
CBC with differential, reticulocyte count, PT, PTT, BUN, creatinine, Na, K, CO 2, Cl, 
glucose, albumin, direct/total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, A LT, GGT, T3, 
T4, TSH. Urinalysis was performed for urine creatinine, and urine dithiocarbamates 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page 24 of 55 (DTC). Two of 12 individuals (both receiving active preparations) showed an 
increase in plasma ALT exceeding the upper limit of normal with one meeting 
criteria for a Grade [ADDRESS_333864] -discharge activities (i.e., possible alcohol 
intake) could not be ascertained. Monitoring of TSH levels demonstrated that in 3 of 
12 subjects (2 active treatment, 1 placebo), TSH levels exceeded the upper limit of 
normal during or after the dosing period. Notably, TSH levels rose for [ADDRESS_333865] 6 Days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273361]. TSH increases were not associated with any clinical symptoms or 
abnormalities of T3 or T4. Evaluation by 2 independent endocrinologists determined 
that the changes in TSH were mild and reversible and did not pose an obstacle to 
further studies with administration of BSPs. No other significant laboratory 
abnormalities occurred. Thus, this Phase I safety study in healthy volunteers revealed 
no evidence of systematic, clinically significant  adverse effects that could be 
attributed to the administration of repeated doses of broccoli sprout extracts 
containing SF or GR (31). 
 
Cornblatt et al.  (29) conducted a study to assess the bioavailability of SF -rich 
broccoli sprout extract in human breast tissue. In this proof -of-principle study, [ADDRESS_333866] -dose plasma dithiocarbamate (DTC ) level was 0.92  0.72 
M, and mean epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]/stromal enriched breast tissue DTC concentration  was 1.45 
 1.12 and 2.00  1.95 pi[INVESTIGATOR_273362]/mg tissue for right and left breast respectively. In 
addition, the investigators were able to measure NQO1 and HO -[ADDRESS_333867] tissue, demonstrating the feasibility of assessing a 24harmacodynamics 
action of SF in these tissues (29). 
 
In an ongoing randomized clinical trial at Johns Hopkins, [ADDRESS_333868] or placebo (mango juice). There were only 
three grade 1 mild gastrointestinal adverse events reported and no significant changes 
(1.5 times or greater) in bloods (comprehensive metabolic panel, full blood count, 
coagulation panel and thyroid tests), taken pre and post intervention (personal 
communication K. Visvanathan).  
 
In the cross over trial conducted by [CONTACT_273427]  (46), 2 of the fifty participants 
randomized to receive the SR -rich beverage (150 µmol/day) during either the first or 
second wave complained of nausea or bitter taste and dropped out of the study. 
Serum chemistry studies conducted on samples obtained after th e last of seven daily 
doses of SF did not present any abnormal values. This study suggests that 150 µmol 
SF/day, approximates the maximum tolerated dose.

    Page [ADDRESS_333869] of oral broccoli sprouts on a 
variety of oxidative stress biomarkers in a double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
randomized controlled trial, in type 2 diabetes patients.  Eighty -one patients were 
randomly as signed to one of three treatment groups for 4 weeks. They received either 
10 g/day, or 5 g/day broccoli sprout powder (BSP), or a placebo of cornstarch and 
chlorophyll (57). The authors report that consumption of BSP resulted in a significant 
decrease in malondialdehyde, oxidized LDL cholesterol, and “oxidative stress index”, 
and a significant increase in total serum antioxidant capacity. They found no 
significant effect on “total antioxidant status” or fasting blood glucose.  Since this 
study employed an over -the-counter broccoli sprout supplement and the authors did 
not make independent determinations of its SF content, and since the fasting blood 
glucose values for the thr ee groups were not closely matched, there is substantial 
concern about the robustness of reported results, although there do appear to be clear 
trends for difference.  
 
In a very recent study of men with recurrent prostate cancer at the Knight Cancer 
Institute in Portland, Oregon, treatment with [ADDRESS_333870] inal (58). 
 
[CONTACT_273469] and his colleagues conducted a randomized phase II trial from October 
2011 to January 2012, in which 267 healthy volunteers in Qidong City, China (a 
region with extremely high liver cancer prevalence) received 84 consecutive daily 
doses of a br occoli sprout beverage containing 600 µmol of glucoraphanin and 40 
µmol of sulforaphane, or an indistinguishable placebo (17). The study participants 
comprised 136 treated with broccoli sprout beverage and 131 placebo controls. Of the 
267 participants completing the study, 50% consumed all assigned doses, and the 
remaining participants consumed at least 80 of the 84 doses. Exten sive blood 
chemistries at the termination of the study showed that the means of 13 analytes were 
identical between treated and control groups, and that specifically no abnormalities 
were detected in BUN, creatinine, and transaminases (ALT and AST). Three 
individuals, 2 in the placebo arm and 1 in the treated arm, had slightly elevated total 
bilirubin (1.1, 1.6, 1.8 mg/dL) and two individuals, [ADDRESS_333871] bilirubin (0.5, 0.6 mg/dL levels).  
4.1.7  Rationale for Selected Doses  
We will use doses of Avmacol® that will provide equivalent concentrations of SF as 
found in our most recent trials of various BSP preparations. Four Avmacol® tablets 
twice daily will provide an internal dose of 120 micromole SF per day.  The dose 
selection is based on the results of our previous clinical trials ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) with 
the maximum tolerable dose and minimal toxicity effect to maximize the biological 
effect (17,59). 
This dose level represents bioactive and tolerable doses in healthy volunteer studies. 
This dose was found to be tolerable and without safety compromise with no grade 2 
or higher toxicities reported.  Although bad taste was the main complaint by [CONTACT_273428] -rich sprouted broccoli seed powder at 
150 μmol/day, the encapsulation of Avmacol® is expected to mask any issues with 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page [ADDRESS_333872] activation 
based on a previous healthy volunteer study (59).  The twice -daily dosing schedule 
will provide a steady level of in vivo SF over the 24 hr a day, as shown in a recent 
report (60).   
4.[ADDRESS_333873] created a unique high -risk 
cohort of approximately 3,600 current and former smokers, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_273363] (PluSS).  At baseline, we administered a risk factor questionn aire, 
tested pulmonary function, assessed low -dose computed tomography (LDCT) for 
emphysema severity, created a biorepository (serum, plasma, and  DNA), and 
implemented procedures to ascertain and characterize new lung cancer diagnoses.  At 
enrollment, Plu SS participants had a mean age of 60 years. Among the participants, 
49% were women; 93% whites, 5.5% blacks, and 1.7% other race/ethnicity groups; 
60% current smokers and 40% former smokers with a median 47 pack -years of 
smoking history (61). The PluSS participants resembled the national representative 
sample of current and former smokers who are at high risk for lung cancer. For 
example, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) enrolled more than 53,000 
persons at high risk for lung cancer a t 33 medical centers across the US.  The mean 
age was 61 years. Forty -one % were women; 91% whites, 4% blacks, and 5% other 
race/ethnicity groups; 48% current smokers and 52% former smokers who quit 
smoking within the previous 15 years; a median 48 pack -years of smoking history 
(62). 
This unique cohort has contributed many scientific discoveries in risk biomarkers of 
lung cancer (61,63-72). For example, the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) significantly increased lung cancer risk (61,66). Compared with 
smokers without COPD, smokers with COPD measured as the Global Initiative for 
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) II or higher or Forced Expi[INVESTIGATOR_273364] (FEV1) < 80 % had more than doubled risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_273365] ( Table 2 ).

We will recruit subjects for the present study from the existing PluSS  participants 
who had mild, moderate or severe emphysema or GOLD II -IV COPD. Among the 
original PluSS participants who, as of 12/31/2015, were <[ADDRESS_333875] 15 years, 356 had GOLD II -IV COPD 
(with or without emphysema), and additional 167 with mild, moderate or severe 
emphysema (without COPD). All these [ADDRESS_333876] study (22), which 
used a very similar protocol as the one proposed here, there was a 20% recruitment 
rate. Thus, we expect to fulfill our recruitment goal of at least [ADDRESS_333877] 3 years of the proposed study.  With a 20% dropou t rate 
based on our previous experience (22), we expect to have [ADDRESS_333878] their oral intake of Avmacol® since this dietar y 
supplement is relatively cheap and commercially available.  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN AND STUDY PROCEDURES  
5.1 Pre-Treatment Evaluation  
Pretreatment tests should be performed within 90 days  prior to the randomization.  
1)   Signed informed consent  
2) Questionnaire data collection on patient’s characteristics and  smoking history .  
3) Physical exam including height, weight , vitals  and SWOG performance status.  
4)  FEV1/FVC  
5) Blood oxygen saturation  
6) Expi[INVESTIGATOR_252293]  
7) Laboratory analysis includ ing  CBC  and serum chemistries  such as total 
bilirubin, AST, ALT,   BUN, creatinine, .  
8) Baseline bronchoscopy: Prior to randomization, all participants will undergo a 
bronchoscopy at the Endoscopy Suite at the UPMC  Shadyside Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . The 
procedure will be carried out by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wilson (Co -PI) using Narrow Band Imaging 
(NBI) white -light bronchoscopy.   The patient’s nose, throat, vocal cords and 
windpi[INVESTIGATOR_273368] (numbing medicine) to help keep patient 
from coughing and to numb patient’s airways .  During the procedure,  [CONTACT_9382] 
will perform a complete airway examination inclu ding visualization of the vocal 
cords, trachea, main carina, and orifices of the sub -segmental bronchi to the 
extent that it is visible without causing trauma to the bronchial wall.  Biopsy 
samples will be collected at the pre -determined sites. Some of the se biopsies will 
be used for the pathological examination. Any patients with lung cancer or 
carcinoma in situ will be ineligible for the present study.  We will inform subjects 
the abnormal  biopsy results and provide appropriate counseling from qualified 
medical personnel.

    Page [ADDRESS_333879] additional clinical procedure or 
intervention on these patients beyond routine follow -up and care. The patients 
with dysplasia will be monitored at each clinical visit (once every three months 
during the treatment period) according to the study protocol.  At the end of study 
period, another biopsy at the same site of initial locations that show dysplasia will 
be performed to evaluate the change (progress, regress or no change) of these 
lesions detected at baseline biopsy. This is one of the  primary outcome measures 
for the proposed study.  After the completion of the study, the patients will 
continue to receive routine medical care including annual CT screening if eligible.  
5.2 Randomization  
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to either Avmacol® or placebo arm with a 
50%-50% chance. Each subject will be given three bottles of tablets at month 0 and at 
trimonthly clinical visits. Each bottle contains 250 tablets that will be sufficient for one 
month supply.  
5.3 Treatment Plan  
5.3.1  Nutraceutical Information  
Please see the Avmacol® Nutraceutical Information Guide for detailed information 
on manufacturing and quality assurance (Appendix 11). 
For this study, capsules will be shipped from Nutramax to the University of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_273369]:  
c/o Brian M. Miller, PharmD  
Director, Investigational Drug Service  
UPMC Hillman Cancer Center  
Ground Floor, AG40.[ADDRESS_333880]  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA [ZIP_CODE]  
Avmacol ® capsules will be stored at room temperature in the Investigational Drug 
Pharmacy at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. After dispensing, they may be stored 
at room temperature at the participant’s home.  
5.3.2  Dose  
Following randomization, subjects will begin to take four study tablets (Avmacol or 
placebo) in the morning with breakfast and four tablets in the evening with dinner.  
Each tablet contains 15 mg of glucoraphanin (GR), but contains no SF. Thus the daily 
ingested dose is 120 mg or 274.29 micromole  GR (molar mass 437.49). Based on our 
most recently completed bioavailability studies in humans (48), the internal 
conversion rate of GR to SF in standard gelcaps  (the same formula for the present 
study) was 44% (see Table 1 – Cohort 5 under Section 5.5.1 Pharmacokinetics and 
Metabolism in Humans  on page 23).  Thus the 8 Avmacol tablets provide a daily 
internal dose of  approxi  120 micromole SF  (274,29 x 0.44 = 120.68 micromole SF) . 
5.3.3  Treatment Duration  
The Avmacol tablets will be administered to study participants for a total duration of 
12 months.  Data regarding the duration of SF administration on altering cellular

precursor) significantly reduced Ki -[ADDRESS_333882] tissue ( P<0.01) 
(16).  We note the conversion rate for this formulation of glucoraphanin to SF was not 
determined by [CONTACT_89588] (16). It is likely lower than our Avmacol formulation: 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 5% in the absence of myrosinase. Our Avmacol tablets provide optimal 
internal dose of SF on apoptosis/proliferation markers, by [CONTACT_273429] [ADDRESS_333883] 
tablets are taken (See Appendix 7. Log Form for Daily Intake of Test Tablets).   
5.3.4  Criteria for Removal from Study  
Given the absence of dose -limiting toxicities described in prior clinical trials, 
clinically significant toxicity is not expected from exposure to Avmacol® tablets.  
However, if a participant shows symptoms or signs of Grade ≥2 toxicity attributable 
to Avm acol®, the participant will be withdrawn from the trial and the study 
supplement will be discontinued.  Follow -up will be maintained until the abnormality 
is resolved.  
Participants maintain the right to leave the trial of their own volition at any point.  
5.4 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
There are no plans for a dose modification in the study.  
5.5 Clinical Visits  
Besides two clinical visits in stage 1 of the study for eligibility screening, all 
eligibility study participants will begin taking the study tablets at visit 1 of stage 2 of 
the study and  return to the study clinic at the end of month s 3, 6, 9, and 12 (the end 
of treatment period).  At each clinical visit, the clinical research nurse/assistant will 
conduct the following:  
1) Exam the subject’s diary for dosing and timing of intake of test tablets, and keep 
the diary in subject’s folder.  
2) Count and record the remaining tablets given.  
3) Provide new study tablets that will supply the next 3 months.  
4) Study participant will turn in the self -administered questionnaire for record ing 
his/her intake of cruciferous vegetables in the past 3 months using a dietary 
frequency questionnaire (Appendix 5).  
5) Collect blood , spot urine  and nasal brushing samples  
6)  Conduct pulmonary function test: FEV1/FVC  
7)  Collect safety and toxicity measures at each clinical visit (once every 3 months) 
during the 12 -month treatment period:  
a) Collect adverse events (AEs) using the AE Recording Form (Appendix 8) 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page 30 of 55 b) Conduct physical examination  including body weigh, height, and vitals  by a 
registered nurse and record the results in the patient’s study file  
c) Laboratory evaluation: CBC with platelets and differential, chemistry panel 
including liver function testing.  
8) Only at the end of treatment period, bronchoscopy will be performed on the 
patient using the same procedure as described above in 5.1(8) and bronchial 
biopsies and lavage samples collected (stage 2 - visit 5).  
 
5.6 Withdrawal from the Protocol

7.1 Adverse Events and Risks  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. 
The s afety reports will be coded using current versions of Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Toxicity severity will be reported using National 
Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) term 
and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE 
version 4.[ADDRESS_333886] a ccess to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm ). 
 
7.1.1  Adverse Events for Broccoli Sprout Preparation Avmacol®  
There is no recognized risk from administration of Avmacol® tablets.  The previous 
studies using broccoli sprout beverages in humans reported that the most common 
adverse events (AEs) or complaint by [CONTACT_273431]. As a tablet 
formulation, Avmacol will overcome the bad taste. Other expected AEs in 
gastroi ntenstinal system are nausea and flatulence.  Table 3 summarizes reported AEs 
in previous studies involved more than 500 study subjects.  
 
There may be adverse events or side effects that are currently unknown. Everyone 
taking part in the study will be monitored  carefully for any side effects, including 
routine physical examinations, complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry 
including liver function test, and food intolerances .  All AEs and toxicity measures 
will be evaluated as one of the objective of the present study.

    Page 35 of 55 7.1.2  Risks Associated with Study Procedures  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bronchoscopy  
 
Bronchoscopy is very safe, but no procedure is entirely free of potential risk.  The 
following is a description of the risks of the procedure.  In recent publications, the 
incidence of serious complications was less than 0.05% (5 in 10,000) in over 23,000 
bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Local discomfort (coughing, gagging and soreness of your nose and 
throat) are frequently unavoidable but can be greatly diminished with adequate 
anesthesia.  Bronchitis is common after bronchoscopy and may resolve spontaneously 
or with ant ibiotic treatment.  Nosebleed, wheezing (about 1% chance), a decrease in 
blood oxygen content of approximately 10% for approximately one half hour, low 
grade fever (less than a 5% chance), and lung infection (pneumonia) in less than 0.1% 
and slight expecto ration of small flecks of blood for 24 hours after the procedure (as a 
result of minor trauma to the bronchial lining) may occur.  More serious 
complications such as major bleeding, lung collapse, vocal cord and bronchial spasm, 
and cardiac irregularity ha ve been reported but are very rare.  Since the patient will be 
medicated for this procedure they will need to make arrangements for someone to 
drive them home.  
A Bronchoscopy Patient Communication Log Form is attached (Appendix 9) to 
follow -up the patients after the bronchoscopy is performed.  Patients are called within 
24 hrs., 72 hrs., and instructed to call within 30 days, if febrile, or with increased 
sputum production, or increasing shortness of breath or any perceived deterio ration of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_22342].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  IV Infusion During Bronchoscopy  
 
An intravenous needle will be placed in the subject’s arm for the infusion of fluids.  
The subject can expect to experience some pain at the moment the needle goes into 
the arm.  In addition to this momentary pain, there will be the minor discomfort of 
having the needle taped in the arm.  In about 10 percent of cases small amount of 
bleeding under the skin will produce a bruise (hematoma).  The risk of temporary 
clotting of the vein is about [ADDRESS_333890]’s arm . 
The collected blood samples will be used for clinical blood tests (CBC and chemistry) 
for subject’s general health and for research use. The subject can expect to experience 
some pain at the moment the needle goes into the arm.  In about 1-2 percent of cases 
small amount of bleeding under the skin will produce a bruise (hematoma).  The risk 
of temporary clotting of the vein is about less than one  percent, while the risk of 
infection of a hematoma or significant external blood loss is less than one in 1,00 0.

7.1.2. 4  Nasal brushing  
 
Nasal  cell scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_273372], pain or minor bleeding. The 
patient may feel some discomfort and nasal sore after nasal brushings. Nasal 
bleedings are minor and can be stopped after holding the nose for a few minutes.  
  
7.1.3  Violation of Privacy and Loss of Confidentiality  
 
Violation of privacy and loss of confidentiality are both risks to which research 
participants are exposed.  The possibility of these risks increases when protected 
health information is collected.  
 
7.2 Definitions of Adverse Events  
 
Adverse event : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
Life-threatening adverse event  or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction : An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject 
at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspect ed adverse 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
Serious adverse event  or serious suspected adverse reaction : An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -
threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5183] o f existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Exampl es of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
 
Suspected adverse reaction : Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adve rse event. Suspected adverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which 
means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page 37 of 55  
Unexpected adverse event  or unexpected suspected adverse reaction : An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available , is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in 
the current application, as amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic 
necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the investigator 
brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_273432]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected 
adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a 
class of dr ugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_333892] (IRB), the Sponsor -Investigator will report, to the IRB, any observed 
or volunteered adverse event that is determined to be 1) associated with the 
investigational drug or study treatment(s) ; 2) serious ; and 3) unexpected . Adverse 
event reports will be submitted to the IRB in accordance with the respective IRB 
procedures.  
 
Applicable adverse events will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible and, in no 
event, later than 10 calendar days following the sponsor -investigator’s receipt of the 
respective information. Adverse events which are 1) associated with the 
investigational drug or study treatment(s) ; 2) fatal or life -threatening ; and 3) 
unexpected  will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of the Sponsor -Investigator’s 
receipt of the respective information.  
 
Follow -up information to a reported adverse event will be submitted to the IRB as 
soon as the relevant information is available. If the results of the Sponsor -
Investigator’s follow -up investigation show that an adverse event that was initially 
determined t o not require reporting to the IRB does, in fact, meet the requirements for 
reporting; the Sponsor -Investigator will report the adverse event to the IRB as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_333893] (DSMB)

hematoxylin -eosin (H&E) staining for histological  evaluation and 10 unstained slides 
will be cut for immunoperoxidase studies.   
8.1.2  Endobronchial Brushing  
Endobronchial brushing samples will be collected from study participants during their 
bronchoscopy procedure using an endoscopic cytobrush (Cellebrity Endoscopic 
Cytobrush; [LOCATION_011] Scientific, [LOCATION_011], MA) to collect normal appearing bronchial 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_273373]. The bronchial brushings will be 
targeted to normal appearing epi[INVESTIGATOR_273374] -stem bronchus and 
avoid sampling tumor tissue or dysplastic cells. If any abnormalities are observed on 
the right bro nchus, the bronchial brushing samples will be collected from the left 
main -stem bronchus.  Up to [ADDRESS_333897] treatment, respectively. All brushing samples will be stored in an 
RNA preservative (RNAprotect; Qiagen) and sent to the test laboratory.   
8.1.3  Bronchoalveolar Lavage  
After the completion of bronchial biopsies and brushing, the bronchoscope will be 
wedged in the right middle lobe or lingular orifice.  Up to 150  ml sterile saline will 
be instilled, retrieved by [CONTACT_273434]. Percent recovery will be recorded. Recovered 
fluid will be passed through a micron sterile nylon filter (Becton Dickinson, New 
Jersey) to remove mucus and particulates, and pooled, and cent rifuged. The BAL

Besides a blood sample for eligibility screening or toxicity testing  (10 ml) , an 
additional  blood sample   (70 ml)   will be collected from study participants at months 
0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 after randomization .  Different blood components (serum, plasma, 
buffy coat , RNA ) in blood samples will be separated and properly stored.  
8.1.6 Urine   
Spot urine samples will be collected at initial screening visit (for pregnancy test for 
women younger than 60 years). Similarly, sport urine samples will be collected as at 
months  0, 3, 6, 9, and 12  after randomization .  Aliquots of collected urine samples 
will be stored at –80oC. The urine samples will be used for quantification of total ITC 
(dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables) and SF -NAC (for monitoring intake of SF 
tablets).  
8.1.[ADDRESS_333898] is scientifically and ethically 
acceptabl e.  Patient samples will be provided to investigators with only the study 
identification number so that investigators will not know the patient’s identity; thus 
enhancing patient confidentiality.  Inadvertent discovery of non -parentage is not 
possible as w e are only planning to collect blood from participants and not their 
family members.  Examples of the types of genetic testing include polymorphisms in 
metabolizing enzymes such as GST genes.  None of these genetic “susceptibility” 
factors would be suffici ent to cause lung cancer, but they may interact with 
environmental exposures (such as tobacco smoke).  Since this genetic testing will be 
performed at an unspecified time in the future, it is not possible to say that we will 
provide patients with any infor mation regarding their genetic background.  In the 
unlikely scenario that we do discover a significant gene that is clinically meaningful, 
we would make every attempt to contact [CONTACT_273435].  
 
8.1.8 Identifiers  
The participant’s unique study ID number will be the only identifier on every 
specimen.  Specimens will be stored in a locked -80°C freezer in the research 
laboratory at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center.  
8.2 Biomarkers  
8.2.1  Histology (atypia)  
It has long been established that abnormal bronchial histology (atypia) is associated 
with cigarette smoking and increased risk for lung cancer. In a follow -up study of a 
high-risk cohort of subjects with endoscopic biopsies, persistence of bronchial 
dyspl asia was associated significantly with a 7 -fold increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_273376] (adjusted hazard ratio = 7.8, 95% CI 1.6 -39.4) (18). All bronchial biopsies 
 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page 41 of 55 for histopathological evaluation will be formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and H&E 
stained for subsequent morphologic evaluation and classification.  Biopsies will be 
classified into 1 of 8 categories as defined by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) 
classification (74) and assigned a score according to the following system: 1= normal; 
2= reserve cell hyperplasia; 3 = squamous metaplasia; 4 = mild dysplasia; 5 = 
moderate dysplasia; 6 = severe dysplasia; 7 = carcinoma in situ; and 8 = invasive 
carcinoma. Subjects with base line score [ADDRESS_333899] ([CONTACT_273470]) in a blinded fashion 
as to treatment group.  
Endobronchial histology scores will be first summarized within each bronchoscopy 
by [CONTACT_2329] [ADDRESS_333900] treatment respectively: (1) The 
first endpoint measure is dysplasia index (DI), that solely examines changes in 
dysplasia pre and post -treatment.  The number of biopsies with dysplasia (with WHO 
histology classification score: 4 -6) are divided by [CONTACT_273436] 100. A positive chan ge of 10% or greater indicates progression while a 
negative change  of 10% or greater is regarded as a positive response.  Scores in -
between are coded as stable. (2) The second endpoint measure is the mean 
histological scores. It is calculated by [CONTACT_273437] -treatment. A positive change in the score by 
1 or more points is defined as progressive disease, a negative change in the score by 1 
point or more p oints is defined as a partial or complete response and scores in -
between are defined as stable d isease. (3) The third model is called the “worst score”. 
It identifies the worst histological grade pre - and post - treatment. A positive change in 
the score by 1 or more points is defined as progressive disease, a negative change in 
the score by 1 point or  more points is defined as a partial or complete response and 
scores in -between are defined as stable disease.   The final response determination for 
a patient requires the same response determination in 2 of the 3 measures.  For the 
rare patient with a di fferent response for each category (progression, stable and 
response) the patient will be deemed stable.  These summary score s will be created by 
[CONTACT_273438], in particular [CONTACT_273470].   
8.2.2  Cell proliferation (Ki -67 labeling index)  
A common endpoint of pathways affected by [CONTACT_273439].  Ki -67 
labeling is a validated indicator of proliferative index and can be readily detected in 
bronchial biopsy material (75-77).  Ki-67 labeling index (Ki -67 LI) is  positively  
associated with increased grade of bronchial dysplasia; a mean of 4% in normal and 
hyperplastic samples increased to 38% in biopsies with moderate or severe dysplasia 
(Table 4). When a serial set of matched biopsies were examined for change over time 
there was correlation between histological change and Ki -67 labeling scores.  Ki -67 
thus is an easily performed proliferative index that will be a primary endpoint in this 
study.

8.2.3  Apoptosis (TUNEL and Caspase -3) 
 
Like the proliferative index, the apoptotic index will provide a measure of a final 
common pathway.  D ietary SF significantly induced markers of apoptosis in lung 
tissue of mice after treated with tobacco carcinogens. Compared with control animals, 
mice given SF showed a statistically significant 6 -fold increase (from 4.7±1.9 to 
29.3±4.7%) in activated cas pase-3, and a 2 -fold increase (from 12.7±3.0 to 
29.4±5.8%) in TUNEL (t erminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling)  of lung cells. 
Activated caspase -3 and TUNEL are representative markers fo r apoptosis (14).  Thus 
we will perform TUNEL and caspas -[ADDRESS_333901]. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_20116] (Co -I) and colleagues (19) recently validated that 
a 23-gene expression marker in epi[INVESTIGATOR_273378] -appearing 
main -stem bronchus significantly improved the diagnostic performance of 
bronchoscopy for detection of lung cancer. The combination of the 23 -gene 
expression marker plus bronchoscopy had a sensitivity of 96% (95% CI, 93% to 98%) 
in the first cohort of patients and 98% (95% CI, 96% to 99%) in the second cohort of 
patients, independent of lesion size and location. In patients with a nondiagnostic 
bronch oscopic examination, the gene -expression classifier accurately identified 
cancer in 89%. The [ADDRESS_333902] genomic classifier to 
improve the diagnostic performance of bronchoscopy for the detection of lung cancer. 
In the proposed s tudy, we will evaluate if the SF treatment alters the gene expression 
of these 23 genes in the bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and decreases the classifier score 
towards that seen with lung benign disease (78). 
 
Using mRNA sequencing (mRNA -Seq), we profiled cytologically normal airway 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_273379] -fluorescence bronchoscopy from high -risk 
smokers with (n=50) and without (n=25) bronchial premalignant lesions (PMLs). 
Using surrogate variable  analysis, we identified 280 genes significantly differentially 
expressed between subjects with and without PMLs at false discovery rate 
(FDR)<0.002. The 280 -gene signature [INVESTIGATOR_16884] a significant concordant relationship to 
gene expression changes identified in PMLs adjacent to non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), in NSCLC tumors, and in the field of individuals with lung cancer 
(FDR<0.05). These data suggest that the change in certain gene expressions in 
bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_273380]. In the proposed study, we will

and potentially the risk for lung cancer. More recently, we have demonstrated that the 
cancer -specific gene -expression changes in the br onchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_273383] -expression alterations observed in the nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_273384] [ADDRESS_333904] -treatment will be compared. 
All biopsies will be graded according to the WHO classification for bronchial 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] (74): 
WHO Classification  Grade  
Normal   1.0 
Reserve Cell Hyperplasia  2.0 
Metaplasia   3.0 
Mild Dysplasia  4.0 
Moderate Dysplasia  5.0 
Severe Dysplasia  6.0 
Carcinoma in Situ  7.0 
Carcinoma   8.0 
Response will then be determined by [CONTACT_273440]:  
a) The worst histology grade per patient pre and post treatment.  
Worse =  [ADDRESS_333905] treatment  
Better =  [ADDRESS_333906] treatment  
Same = same point score pre and post treatment  
 
b) Average histology (all biopsies scores/number of biopsies) pre and post treatment  
Worse =  [ADDRESS_333907] treatment  
Better =  [ADDRESS_333908] treatment  
Same = same point score pre and post treatment

100) pre and post treatment.  
Worse = > 10% higher post treatment  
Better = > 10% lower post treatment  
Same = < 10% difference post treatment  
The final response determination will require the same response parameter 
(worse, better or the same) for 2 of the 3 methods.   
8.3.2  Cellular Biomarker Response  
A secondary endpoint is to determine if SF can modulate a proliferative intermediate 
marker Ki -67. Based on prior studies, a response will be considered as a decrease of 
> 10 in the labeling index, progression will be an increase of > 10 in the labeling 
index and no change will signify an increase or decrease of < 10. 
We will also evaluate other biomarkers including apoptotic biomarkers TUNEL and 
caspase -3.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_333909] (59).  The alteration of lung cancer associated gene expression in BAL is an 
indication of SF’s impact on lung cancer risk in the study population.  
8.3.4  Safety and Toxicity Assessment  
 
The safety and toxicity will be assessed by [CONTACT_273441]. We plan to closely monitor all study patients for potential 
SF-related adverse events.  This includes both expected (based on previous clinical 
experience with oral SF) and unexpected events. The expected adverse events  (AEs) 
are gastrointestinal including taste alternation (bad taste), dry mouth, belching, 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The frequencies of AEs were low and most were  at 
moderate by [CONTACT_479] (see Table 3) . 
 
9. STATISTICAL AND SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS  
 This is a randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of 
SF as a chemopreventive agent.   Eligible subjects are former smokers with 30 pack -
years smoking history who quit smoking <[ADDRESS_333910].  The primary objective of this trial is to assess whether oral SF su pplementation 
elicits an increased histologic response when compared to placebo in this pop ulation over 
a 12-month treatment period.   The planned sample size is 72 subjects (36 per treatment 
arm).  A block randomization scheme will be used to ensure that both treatment and 
placebo group have the same proportion of men and women, respectively. T he 
randomization will be done at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center.  
9.1 Statistical Analysis for histological responses  
 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page [ADDRESS_333911] treatment respectively: 1) dysplasia 
index (DI, number of biopsies with dysplasia/total number of biopsies x 100), 2) average 
of all histological scores (all biopsies scores/number of biopsies), and 3) worst biopsy 
score.  The 3 summary end points will be analyzed within 4 different biopsy site 
groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]: all biopsies, biopsies from the [ADDRESS_333912] treatment are then calculated.   
The primary endpoint is the dysplasia index (DI), which has a binomial distribution with 
at least 6 “trials” (i.e., 6 predetermined biopsy sites), and will be analyzed by [CONTACT_106869] (GEE) that constrains average baseline DI to be the same for both 
treatment and placebo groups, and tests whether average follow -up DI differs between 
the SF treatment and placebo groups.  All other endpoints and biopsy site groupi[INVESTIGATOR_273385].  The primary analysis for the average and worst dysplasia scores 
will be a l inear regression that assesses the difference in post -treatment scores by [CONTACT_273442], controlling for the same scores at pre -treatment.  This analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) approach has optimal efficiency in a study design to assess the 
pre- and post -treatment measures with high within -subject correlation due to repeated 
measures (80).  No interim analyses for futility or superiority will be performed, other 
than ongoing safety monitoring.  
Sample size consideration.   In the iloprost  trial, [ADDRESS_333913] or placebo for 6 months.  Treatment effects (adjusted for baseline 
levels) were statistically significant (P≤0.01) for all 3 endpoints (dysplasia index, average 
dysplasia score, worst dyspl asia score). Anticipating a 20% dropout rate over [ADDRESS_333914] 72 study subjects to ensure that 60 subjects complete our SF 
study.  Assuming an average baseline dysplasia index of 22% and post -therapy 11% for 
subjects receiving SF,  a simulation with 10,000 trials with a sample size of 60 subjects 
has yielded an 80% statistical power to detect a statistically significant (two -sided 
p<0.05) treatment effect, using generalized linear models (binomial family, 6 biopsies) 
after controlli ng for baseline levels of DI.  Calculations are similar for other endpoints, 
and actual power should be greater than the DI measure because they are continuous 
measures and have observed within -subject correlation (i.e., repeated measures).  
 
9.2 Statistical Analysis for Cellular Proliferation/Apoptosis Markers  
Ki-67, caspase -3 and TUNEL will be quantified as % positive cells in two slides of each 
tissue block. First we calculate the average values of each of the [ADDRESS_333915] deviation 
(12.7±8.2) of Ki -67 LI in the para -basal layer of bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_273386] (15) and 
the logit function, we back calculated plausible estimates of the mean (2.3676) and 
 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page 46 of 55 variance (0.3480) of log -transformed baseline Ki -67 LI (81).  Assuming these log -
transformed Ki -67 LI values are normally distributed, we simulated 10,000 sets of data 
(n=60 each) and found an 84% statistical power with a two -sided P<0.[ADDRESS_333916] size of 37% for change in Ki -67 LI after 12 months of SF treatment (i.e., 
median Ki -67 LI of 10.7% at baseline and 6.7% at follow -up on SF). This detectable 
effect size is smaller than 61% reduction in cell proliferation marker in the SF treatment 
group (14).  Furthermore, a recent randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled phase 2 
clinical trial involving 58 women found that oral intake of SF glucosinolate for 2 -8 weeks 
resulted in a statistically significant reduction of mean Ki -67 LI (P = 0.01) (16). 
9.3 Statistical Analysis for Gene Expression  
A summary gene expression score will be derived from previously determined gene 
expression features of 23 genes (19,82): score = 𝑒𝑦 /(1+𝑒𝑦), where y = 𝑏0+∑𝑏𝑗∗𝑥𝑗, 
where b0 is the intercept, 𝑏𝑗 is the coefficient, and 𝑥𝑗 is the feature of the gene j 
expression [see details in (82)]. We will calculate the gene expression score (0~1) for 
each subject pre and post treatment separately. A linear mixed effect model will be used 
to assess the effect of SF on post-treatment gene expression scores, similar as described 
in Section 4.2.1. A decreased gene expression score post -treatment towards those seen in 
bronchial benign disease is indicative of the chemopreventive effect of SF on the lung 
cancer -gene expression.  
We will use the similar approach to calculate a summary gene expression score of the 
280-gene signature [CONTACT_273468] (PMLs) in identified our 
preliminary study. Similarly a  linear mixed effect model will be used to assess the post-
treatment gene expression scores. If SF causes a significant change of the score towards 
the regression of PMLs based on histological dysplasia index score, the gene -level 
expression changes will be examined to estimate the SF -treatment effects on ind ividual 
gene or a cluster of genes.  
To assess the similarity and difference in the gene expressions between the bronchial 
airway and nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603], we will use our similar methodologies described previously 
(73). For each gene identified in the analysis above, we will use a linear mixed effects 
model that includes site (bronchus or nose) and treatment (SF or placebo) as fixed effect. 
The regression model is given: Gij ~ µ + β s•Xs + β t•Xt + β st•Xs •Xt + ε ij, where Gij is the 
log 2 expression value for gene i in patient j; the parameter µ is the overall mean of log [ADDRESS_333917] for the interaction between site and treatment; and Xs for site (1=nose, 
0=bronchus) and Xt for treatment (1=SF, 0=placebo).  
  
Sample Size Consideration.   The Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array contains 
~36,[ADDRESS_333918] a 85% 
power to detect a [ADDRESS_333919] treatment (long 2 |d|=1.0, 
σd = 0.7) for 23 identified cancer -related genes at a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05 using 
the method of Liu and Hwang  (83), assuming 99.9% non -differentially expressed genes 
(𝜋0=0.999). Similarly  the study will have a 96% power for 280 PMLs -related genes 
(i.e., 𝜋0=0.990), and a 99% power for 5% differentially expressed genes (i.e., 𝜋0=
0.950) in exploratory analysis.  
 
 
Phase II Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention with Sulforaphane : Clinical Protocol Version 11 (09/23/2019)  
    Page 47 of 55 9.4 Statistical Analysis for Adverse Events and Toxicity Measures  
The frequencies of adverse events (AEs) and toxicity measures (e.g., CBC, liver function 
test, body weight) will be compared between the SF treatment and placebo arm.  The 
analysis will be conducted for total AEs and specific AEs, expected AEs and unexpect ed 
AEs, AEs by [CONTACT_273443][INVESTIGATOR_007], respectively, at each clinical visit as well as 
the summed total over [ADDRESS_333920] will be used for compa ring the 
frequencies between the two treatment groups.  
 
Sample Size Consideration.   As described in Table 3 above, the frequencies of AEs 
reported were low in previous studies. Based on the frequencies repored by [CONTACT_273444], 
the frequency of total AE in placebo was 33% (9 out of 27 participants), the proposed 
study with a total of [ADDRESS_333921] an 80% statistical power to detect a doubled 
frequency (67%) of total AEs in the SF -treatment group.  The proposed study can detect a 
less excess AE rate between the two treatment groups if all AEs over different time 
points are combined  or all AEs are counted independently.  
 
10. GENDER AND MINORITY INCLUSION  
The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_273387], both therapeutic and non -therapeutic, for all citizens of their state and 
region, including their under -served populations. Every effort is made to provide a ccess 
to clinical trials for all individuals and special emphasis is placed on retaining those who 
are enrolled.  
At enrollment, PluSS participants had a mean age of 60 years. Among the participants, 
49% were women; 93% whites, 5.5% blacks, and 1.7% other race/ethnicity groups; 60% 
current smokers and 40% former smokers with a median 47 pack -years of smoking 
history (61). The PluSS participants resembled the national representative sample of 
current and former smokers who are at high risk for lung cancer. For example, the 
National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) enrolled more than 53,000 persons at high risk for 
lung cancer a t 33 medical centers across the US.  The mean age was 61 years. Forty -one 
% were women; 91% whites, 4% blacks, and 5% other race/ethnicity groups; 48% 
current smokers and 52% former smokers who quit smoking within the previous 15 
years; a median 48 pack -years of smoking history (62).

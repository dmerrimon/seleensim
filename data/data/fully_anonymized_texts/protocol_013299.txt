 1. BACKGROUND 
 
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and is 
characterized by [CONTACT_423125], and is considered incurable 
with standard treatment options. Prognosis has been associated with age, stage, disease burden, lactate 
dehydrogenase, hemoglobin, and presence of B-symptoms.[1, 2] The majority of patients with FL 
present with advanced stage disease and are often asymptomatic. In addition to clinical prognostic 
factors, biologic or immune signature [CONTACT_423152]. [2-4] FL is characterized by 
[CONTACT_423126]-2 deregulation, t(14:18) and forms the basis for PCR assessment of minimal 
residual disease (MRD) in FL.[5] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_177164], most patients with FL will succumb to their 
disease and clinical outcomes remain heterogeneous.  
Though a number of management strategies have been utilized for patients with previously untreated 
FL, it was not until incorporation of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody to CD20 antigen that 
improvement in overall survival was achieved.[6] Based on the Stanford experience, there was no 
significant change in the natural history of FL from the 1960’s through the early 1990’s, despi[INVESTIGATOR_423091][7]. The most commonly prescribed frontline strategy for 
FL in the [LOCATION_002] in the modern era is rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.[8] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_423092][9, 10], and median PFS exceeding 5 years with the addition of maintenance 
rituximab[11], chemoimmunotherapy is not considered curative in FL, as patients continue to relapse.  
In addition, the side effect profile associated with cytotoxic therapy[12] raises the question, what is the 
optimal frontline strategy for FL? 
Lenalidomide, a thalidomide derivative, is a second generation immunomodulatory drug, proposed to 
have multiple mechanisms of action, including beneficial effects on both tumor and microenvironment. 
Lenalidomide has been associated with TNF- α inhibitory, and T -cell costimulatory, and antiangiogenic 
activities.[13] The molecular action of lenalidomide, involves its binding to protein targets cereblon, 
Ikaros, and Aiolos[14- 17], and subsequent effects on protein ubiquitination and degradation.[18] 
Lenalidomide as an immunomodulator is an interesting approach to the management of FL given the 
most successful therapy to date for FL has been incorporation of immune therapy (rituximab).  
Most frequently reported adverse events reported during clinical studies with lenalidomide in oncologic 
and non-oncologic indications, regardless of presumed relationship to study medication include: 
anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhea, dehydration, rash, itching, infections, sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, chest pain, 
weakness, hypotension, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, back pain, bone pain, generalized pain, 
dizziness, mental status changes, syncope, renal failure, dyspnea, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism, 
deep vein thrombosis, cerebral vascular accident, convulsions, dizziness, spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377],

[ADDRESS_534432] lymphoma, as 
demonstrated in vitro and in animal models, by [CONTACT_423127]-induced apoptosis and rituximab-
dependent NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.[19- 22] Based on the observed efficacy of lenalidomide 
combined with rituximab in relapsed/refractory indolent NHL[23], and the expectation of synergy 
between these agents, our group completed a phase 2, single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of lenalidomide and rituximab in patients with untreated, advanced-stage indolent NHL, 
demonstrating efficacy and safety of the combination.[24] Overall response rate (ORR) in our study was 
90% with a complete response rate of 63%, and 75% of patients remained in remission at 36 months. Of 
the evaluable patients with FL (N=46), 45 had an ORR, 98%. 40 patients with FL had a CR or unconfirmed 
CR (87%), and three-year PFS estimates were 78.5%.[24] Similar findings were demonstrated by a phase 
2, multi-center study investigating the combination in previously untreated patients with indolent 
NHL.[25] Based on these findings, a phase 3, randomized international registration study comparing the 
efficacy of lenalidomide and rituximab versus chemoimmunotherapy for previously untreated FL 
patients (RELEVANCE; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has completed enrollment, results are eagerly awaited, but not 
anticipated for a few years.  
Another compelling approach to management of indolent NHL is targeting a key cellular pathway or 
attribute specific to tumor cells. The B-cell receptor (BCR) is the unique molecular fingerprint of each B-
cell and signals emanating from the BCR act through downstream pathways to direct development, 
proliferation, and survival of normal B cells. The BCR and downstream pathways are also frequently 
manipulated by B-cell malignancies. As a result, targeted agents inhibiting BCR-activated signaling 
pathways have been successfully translated into the clinical setting.[26, 27] Ibrutinib, an orally available, 
selective kinase inhibitor irreversibly binds Cys-481 residue on Bruton tyrosine kinase. In a phase 1 study 
of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies, ibrutinib was well tolerated; the maximum 
tolerated dose was not reached.[28] Notable was an ORR of 60% in evaluable patients. These findings 
prompted multiple phase 2 studies [26, 29], demonstrating efficacy of ibrutinib and led to FDA approval 
in relapsed mantle cell lymphoma patients who have received at least one prior therapy, chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma patients who have received at least one prior 
therapy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma patients with deletion 17p, and 
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. Ibrutinib is being studied for the treatment of several other illnesses 
and its use in this study is investigational.  
With the evolving knowledge of the BCR pathway and tumor microenvironment, exploiting insights into 
the oncogenic pathways appears to be a promising approach. The combination of lenalidomide and 
ibrutinib has reported synergism in vitro.[14] In a cereblon-dependent fashion, lenalidomide 
downregulates IRF4 and SPIB, transcription factors that prevent interferon β production by [CONTACT_423128]7 and amplify NF- κB signaling by [CONTACT_423129]11. [14] Blockade of BCR signaling using 
ibrutinib also downregulates IRF4 and synergizes with lenalidomide in killing activated B-cell like diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma cell lines, suggesting an attractive therapeutic strategy.   
A phase 1 study of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide in previously untreated 
stage II-IV FL patients has been completed ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The primary objective was to determine the 
recommended phase 2doses of ibrutinib and lenalidomide for combination with rituximab in previously Commented [CP[1]: GCDO: align with current label – add Small 
Lymphatic Lymphoma.

 untreated FL. Secondary objectives were to determine the pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and its major 
metabolite (PCI-[ZIP_CODE]) when combined with lenalidomide and rituximab and to determine the 
pharmacodynamics of basophil activation and BTK occupancy in PBMCs over a 24-hour period of 
ibrutinib when given in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab.  Treatment consisted of dose 
escalations of lenalidomide and ibrutinib and a fixed dose of rituximab (375 mg/m2). Once the 
maximum tolerated dose was reached, there was to be an expansion cohort of ten additional patients. 
These ten patients were to receive the fixed dose of rituximab, and the recommended phase 2 doses of 
ibrutinib and lenalidomide. Patients received lenalidomide PO on days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle for 18 
cycles, and ibrutinib PO on days 1-28 until disease progression. Patients received rituximab by [CONTACT_423130] 1, day 8, day 15, and day 22 of cycle 1. Four remaining doses of rituximab were to be 
given at week 13, week 21, week 29, and week 37.   
 
22 subjects with FL were enrolled at different dose levels.

-[ADDRESS_534433] for a 3+3 design. If dose level 0 is shown to be too toxic (i.e. 
has > 1/6 DLTs), dose de-escalation was to be continued until finding a dose level with 0/3 or 1/6 DLT. If 
the dose level has 1/6 DLT this dose was to be selected as the MTD. If the dose level has 0/3 DLT, 
another 3 pa tients were to be added at this level. If the level has ≤ 1/6 DLT with the addition, of 3 
patients, it will be selected as the MTD. If the dose level has > 1/[ADDRESS_534434] cycle of treatment. Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.0. Patients were to be 
evaluated once per cycle for any adverse events. 
 
Non-hematologic dose-limiting toxicity was defined as any of the following: any Grade 3 or 4 non-
hematologic toxicity (excluding: Grade 3 rash that resolves to < Grade 2 within 10 days with systemic 
corticosteroid treatment, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, fever without neutropenia, tumor lysis syndrome); 
grade 3 rash that does not resolve to < Grade 2 within 10 days with corticosteroid treatment; any grade 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]; grade 3-4 bullous dermatitis; failure of any 
Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity (as defined above) to resolve or recover to baseline level after 
delaying the next dose by [CONTACT_726] 2 weeks; AST or ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_534435] in combination with a total bilirubin 
≥ [ADDRESS_534436]. Hematologic dose -limiting toxicity was defined as any of the following: any Grade 4 
hem
atologic toxicity, except for grade 4 neutropenia ≤ 7 days; grade 4 neutropenia > 7 days; grade 3 or

 4 neutropenia complicated by [CONTACT_411] ≥ 38.5°C or infection; grade 4 thrombocytopenia (mus t be repeated 
same day by a separate peripheral blood draw to confirm toxicity); grade 2-3 thrombocytopenia 
complicated by [CONTACT_327785]. 
 
The preliminary safety data that has not been reported or published suggests the combination is 
tolerable.  Of 22 subjects, 8 developed a Grade 1 or 2 rash, and 8 subjects developed a Grade 3 rash; 
rash was not considered a DLT in this study unless the rash did not resolve to < Grade 2 within 10 days 
with corticosteroid treatment.  In addition, rash was associated with allopurinol in several cases and 
with Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) in 1 case.  No cytokine storm reactions were seen.  
As a result of this approach, in the CTEP/A051103 study, no DLTs were seen and no MTD was identified.  
The rashes were manageable with temporary holding of ibrutinib and lenalidomide, concomitant 
therapy with corticosteroids and/or antihistamines, and discontinuation of potential contributors such 
as allopurinol if applicable.  The maximum dose of lenalidomide given was the highest planned dose of 
20 mg.   
In the phase 2 study of lenalidomide and rituximab in previously untreated FL [24], the most common 
hematologic adverse event was neutropenia (25% grade 3, 10% grade 4), however, febrile neutropenia 
was infrequent (<1%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_423093] (21% grade 2, 2% grade 3). 
Common non- hematologic adverse events were fatigue (90% all grades, 5% grade ≥3), pain or myalgia 
(82% all grades, 9% grade 3), nausea or vomiting (61% all grades, 0 grade ≥3), rash (58% all grades, 7% 
grade 3), diarrhea (50% al l grades, 0 grade≥3), and constipation (52% all grades, 0 grade ≥3). Less 
frequent non-hematologic grade 1 or 2 adverse events included cough (44%), dizziness (43%), edema 
(43%), peripheral neuropathy (36%), infusion reaction (13%), and thyroid test abnormalities (23%). 
Second malignancies were reported in 5 patients. No deaths occurred on study as a result of toxicity. 
The MTD of ibrutinib in phase 1 studies has not been reached. [28] The most common (>20%) non-
hematologic adverse events associated with ibrutinib have generally been mild (Grade 1 or 2) and 
include diarrhea (50%), fatigue (41%), nausea (31%), peripheral edema (28%), dyspnea (27%), 
constipation (25%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (23%), vomiting (23%), and decreased appetite (21%). 
Grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicities include neutropenia (16%), thrombocytopenia (11%), and anemia 
(10%). [26] Four patients in the phase 2 study that led to the FDA indication for ibrutinib in 
relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma had subdural hematomas (Grade [ADDRESS_534437], Grade 3 in 2 subjects); all were associated with falls, head trauma, or both. [26] Though 
infrequent, additional non-traumatic bleeding complications associated with ibrutinib have been 
reported including gastrointestinal bleeding and hematuria. 
Marginal zone lymphoma is a less frequent indolent NHL and is most commonly managed similar to 
follicular lymphoma given limited prospective data to guide routine practice. We included untreated 
marginal zone and small lymphocytic lymphoma in the phase 2 study of rituximab in combination with 
lenalidomide.[30] We enrolled 30 subjects with untreated marginal zone lymphoma subjects, 67% 
achieved a CR and 22% a PR with an ORR of 89%. Median PFS was 53.[ADDRESS_534438] identified a set of 
markers with differential expression in nodal marginal zone lymphoma compared with follicular 
lymphoma. [31, 32] The nodal marginal zone lymphoma signature [CONTACT_423153], interleukins (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10), integrin signaling (CD40), and cell 
survival pathways (MAPKs, tumor necrosis factor, transforming growth factor- β, and NF -κB), conferring 
a survival advantage in nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Inactivation of the A20 gene is also a common 
genetic aberration in marginal zone lymphoma which may contribute to lymphomagenesis via 
constitutive NF- κB signaling. [33] Alteration in lymphoma biology and signaling may explain the 
differences observed with therapeutic outcomes in follicular and marginal zone lymphoma. Targeting 
the BCR pathway may be even more atractive in marginal zone lymphoma . A phase II trial PCYC- 1121 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) examined single agent ibrutinib in [ADDRESS_534439] one prior therapy. The results are eagerly awaited, but are anticipated to be favorable given a 
supplemental new drug application has been submitted to the FDA for use of ibrutinib as treatment for 
patients with marginal zone lymphoma.  Therefore, extending the eligibility of this study to untreated 
marginal zone lymphoma is warranted to examine the safety and efficacy of rituximab, lenalidomide and 
ibrutinib in untreated marginal zone lymphoma. 
With the prolonged natural history of FL, identifying optimal endpoints or surrogates for overall survival 
for frontline studies is an evolving field. In an analysis of the National LymphoCare Study, previously 
untreated patients with FL who experienced progressive disease within 2 years of initial treatment were 
identified as a high risk group, “early progressors”. [34] Early progression was dramatically associated 
with poor overall survival, hazard ratio (HR) =13.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.94-22.4). After 
adjusting for FLIPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], early progression was associated with an increased risk of death (HR=15.4, 95% 
CI 9.6-24.7). This suggests that a landmark progression-free survival at [ADDRESS_534440] for a high risk 
population and discern a difference in outcomes. Another proposed efficacy endpoint includes the 
complete response rate at 120 weeks or 30 months.[35] Both approaches serve as surrogate endpoints 
for overall survival. 
We are proposing a novel frontline, open-label, phase [ADDRESS_534441] in addition to the tumor and microenvironment.  
We aim to explore the efficacy and safety of the novel combination of rituximab, lenalidomide, and 
ibrutinib in previously untreated patients with FL and marginal zone lymphoma .

5.3.1 Dosage and Administration 
Below are specific administration instructions for drugs used within this study: 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
18 
 Ibrutinib 
Ibrutinib 560mg (4 x 140mg capsules) is administered orally once daily with approximately 8 ounces 
(240mL) of water. Ibrutinib may be administered with or without food. For patients with mild liver 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the recommended dose of ibrutinib is 140 mg daily (one capsule), see 
Table 1. Grapefruit or Seville oranges should be avoided due to CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_534453] and subjects should not attempt to open, break or chew the capsules or dissolve in 
water. Capsules should be taken at approximately the same time each day. No extra capsules should be 
taken to make up missed doses of ibrutinib. Ibrutinib dosing is continuous throughout the treatment 
phase. If a dose is missed, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the 
normal schedule the following day. No extra capsules to make up the missed dose should be taken.  
Table 1. Ibrutinib Dose Adjustment for Patients with Hepatic Impairment 
Category  Hepatic Impairment (Child -Pugh) Dose 
Mild hepatic impairment  Class A 140mg (1 capsule) daily  
 
Ibrutinib will be dispensed to subjects in bottles. Unused ibrutinib capsules dispensed during the 
previous visits should be returned and accountability records must be updated. Unused capsules should 
not be re-distributed to anyone. Subjects should return all used bottles to the site when they receive 
new study drug. Unused study drug will be destroyed as per our institution guidelines.  
Treatment will continue until disease progression, end of study, or other reason for treatment 
discontinuation outlined in section 8. Dose modifications for toxicity are outlined in section 5.4. 
 
Rituximab 
Rituximab is given as 375mg/m2 IV infusion once weekly for 4 doses starting on day 1 of cycle 1 (± 2 
days). For cycles 2 through 12, rituximab is given as 375mg/m2, one dose on day 1 (± 2 days) of each 
cycle.  The costs for administering rituximab are to be covered by [CONTACT_31031]’s insurance. Pre 
medications for rituximab will be administered per institutional guidelines. 
First infusion: 
Rituximab should be administered intravenously per institutional guidelines. The final concentration of 
rituximab is 1mg/mL. Rituximab will be administered at an initial rate of 50mL/hr. The infusion rate may 
be escalated in 50mL/hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400mL/hr as tolerated. If 
hypersensitivity or an infusion reaction develops, the infusion should be interrupted until symptoms 
resolve or improve. For management of infusion reaction, please refer to the institution’s 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
19 
 hypersensitivity reaction order sheet. The infusion can continue at one-half the previous rate upon 
improvement in symptoms, and the escalation of 50mL/hr increments every 30 minutes resumes to a 
maximum rate of 400mL/hr. 
Subsequent infusions: 
If subjects tolerated the first infusion well, the subsequent infusions can start at an initial rate of 
100mL/hr as per institution guidelines and increase by 100mL/hr increments every 30 minutes to a 
maximum of 400mL/hr as tolerated. If subjects did not tolerate the first infusion well, follow the 
guidelines for the first infusion.  
Lenalidomide 
Patients with CrCl >60 mL/min will receive 15mg of lenalidomide days 1 through 21 of cycle 1, and 20mg 
of lenalidomide days 1 (± 2 days) through 21 every 28 day days for cycles 2 through 12 for a total of 12 
cycles. Dosing will be based on patient’s creatinine clearance (CrCL) as calculated by [CONTACT_283016] -
Gault (Appendix 13.3), Table 2. See below for further instruction on dose adjustment for subjects with 
renal impairment. 
Lenalidomide should be taken orally at about the same time each day, either with or without food. 
Lenalidomide capsules should be swallowed whole with water, and should not be opened, broken, or 
chewed. If a dose is missed, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the 
normal schedule the following day. No extra capsules to make up the missed dose should be taken. 
Females of childbearing potential should not handle or administer lenalidomide unless they are wearing 
gloves. Unused lenalidomide capsules dispensed during the previous visits should be returned and 
accountability records must be updated. Unused capsules should not be re-distributed to anyone. 
Subjects should return all used bottles to the site when they receive new study drug. Unused study drug 
will be destroyed as per our institution guidelines. 
 
Lenalidomide Dose Adjustment for Renal Impairment 
Subjects with renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 60 ml/min) will be dosed based on Table 2.  CrCL assessment will 
occur on: Day 1, 8, 15, and 22 for cycle 1; Day 1 and 15 for cycle 2; Day [ADDRESS_534454] has a creatinine obtained at any time during the Treatment Phase because it was clinically 
indicated, a dose reduction based on CrCL and Table 2 should be performed. For cycle 1, subjects with 
renal impairment, CrCL of 30-60mL/min, will initiate 15mg of lenalidomide every 48 hours.  Subjects 
with renal impairment, CrCL of <30 mL/min prior to cycle 1, will initiate 10mg of lenalidomide every 48 
hours. For subjects with renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 60 ml/min ) necessitating dose adjustment on Day 1 of 
a cycle according to Table 2, but then stably improves, a dose increase based on CrCL will not occur until 
day 1 of the next cycle. For subjects with CrCl ≤ 60 ml/min at study initiation, but then stably improves  
to > 60 ml/min, proceed to lenalidomide 20 mg once daily with Cycle 2. At any point, should a patient 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
20 
 require dose reduction due to reduced CrCl, and the CrCl then stably improves, dose escalation will not 
occur until day 1 of the next cycle.

 Level -2 280 mg per day   
Level -3 140 mg per day  
Level -4 Discontinue ibrutinib  
The dose of ibrutinib may be reduced successively by [CONTACT_177222], Table 4. Once a 
patient’s dose has been reduced, no dose re-escalation is permitted. Patients who cannot tolerate the 
lowest applicable dose level are to be discontinued from the Treatment Phase. Patients with mild 
hepatic impairment will be starting at 140mg per day as outlined in Table 1. If these subjects have 
toxicity that result in dose modification of ibrutinib as outlined above, they will be discontinued from 
the Treatment Phase as they are starting at the lowest applicable dose level and cannot tolerate 
therapy. 
Please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for guidelines for management of ibrutinib in subjects who require treatment 
with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor. 
5.4.3 Rituximab 
The rituximab dose should be held for any unmanageable toxicity that is consistent with the rules 
outlined in Table 3. A missed dose of rituximab on the weekly schedule for any reason will not be made 
up (the visit window for this visit and Day 1 of Cycles 2 -12 is ±2 days).  
5.4.4 Lenalidomide 
The lenalidomide dose should be held for any unmanageable toxicity that is consistent with the rules 
outlined in Table 3. 
The dose of lenalidomide may be reduced successively by [CONTACT_177222], Table 5. Once a 
patient’s dose has been reduced, no dose re-escalation is permitted. Patients who cannot tolerate the 
lowest applicable dose level are to be discontinued from the Treatment Phase. Dose modification should 
also meet the specifications outlined for those subjects with renal insufficiency as outlined in Table 2. If 
patients with renal impairment are currently receiving 10mg every [ADDRESS_534458] meets any of the following criteria, then withdrawal from the study treatment is mandatory: 
 Subject has confirmed progressive disease (PD) 
 Subject has an intercurrent illness or AE that prevents further treatment administration beyond 
28 days 
 Subject decides to withdraw from study 
 Subject becomes pregnant 
 Subject is routinely noncompliant with study procedures and/or scheduled evaluations 
 Subject requires a prohibited concomitant medication 
 Investigator considers withdrawal to be in the best interest of the subject. 
A safety follow up visit is required for all subjects except those who have withdrawn full consent.  
6. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/PROCEDURES  
6.1 Concomitant Medications 
6.1.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications 
Supportive medications (such as for emesis, diarrhea, constipation, etc.) should be delivered in 
accordance with standard practice. Tumor lysis prophylaxis should be administered during cycle [ADDRESS_534459] practice. Of note, aprepritant is a moderate CYP3A4/5 
inhibitor and should be used with caution as outlined below in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Use of neutrophil growth 
factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) is permitted for 
management of neutropenia in accordance with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
guidelines. Preemptive or prophylactic G-CSF during cycle 1 is not required. Transfusions may be given in 
accordance with institutional policy. 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
26 
 Short courses of corticosteroids (<14 days) for treatment of non-lymphoma related medical reasons (e.g. 
rash, arthritis, asthma) or for tumor flare at doses that do not exceed 10mg per day of prednisone or 
equivalent are permitted, See Section 6.1.3.  However, if clinically indicated, higher doses of 
corticosteroids (>10mg per day) are permissible. 
  
6.1.2 Concomitant Medications to be used with Caution 
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant use of CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors/Inducers 
Ibrutinib is metabolized primary by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5. Due to the potential increase in ibrutinib exposure, 
concomitant use of strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, clarithyromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, and nefazadone) should be avoided while the 
subject is receiving treatment.  
If use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is necessary, selection of an alternate concomitant medication with 
less potent enzyme inhibition potential is strongly recommended. If concomitant use of ibrutinib with a 
strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is unavoidable, ibrutinib should be discontinued. After completing treatment 
with the strong CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_534460] 7 days before resuming ibrutinib.  
Subjects should avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during ibrutinib treatment, as these contain 
moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4/5. In addition, moderate CYP3A4/5 inhibitors commonly used include 
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, and fluconazole. These moderate CYP3A4/5 inhibitors 
should be avoided, but if necessary are permissible and should be used with caution. 
Co-administration of ibrutinib with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_423096]) may 
decrease ibrutinib plasma concentrations and should be avoided.   
A comprehensive list of inhibitors, inducers, and substrates may be found at 
www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/u
cm093664.htm#cypEnzymes

[IP_ADDRESS] Thromboembolism Prophylaxis   
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_423097] a thromboembolic event (history of a 
thromboembolic event, taking concomitant medications associated with an increased risk for a 
thromboembolic event, a known hypercoagulable state regardless of thromboembolic history) receive 
prophylactic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81mg) daily unless contraindicated. If aspi[INVESTIGATOR_177178], the patient must 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
[ADDRESS_534461] be taken in high-risk situations. For patients who 
are deemed very high-risk for venous thromboembolism, the treating physician should strongly consider 
prophylactic doses of low molecular weight heparin (i.e. enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily). All 
patients who develop a deep venous thromboembolism in any location must be treated appropriately 
with low molecular weight heparin. Heparin should continue for at least 3 months, however treating 
physician discretion is allowed. Study treatment is to continue during heparin use. For subjects in whom 
low molecular weight heparin is contraindicated (i.e., renal impairment), a non-vitamin K antagonist 
anti-coagulant can be used instead where medically appropriate. 
Warfarin and Other Vitamin K Antagonists 
Warfarin and similar vitamin K antagonists are not permitted during this trial. They should not be given 
within 30 days prior to initiation of ibrutinib. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Antiplatelet and Anticoagulation 
VTE prophylaxis is discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Warfarin or similar  vitamin K antagonists should not be 
administered concomitantly with ibrutinib. Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E should be 
avoided. Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib.  Grade 3 or higher 
bleeding events (subdural hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria and post procedural 
hemorrhage) have occurred in up to 6% of patients.  Bleeding events of any grade, including bruising 
and petechiae, occurred in approximately half of patients treated with ibrutinib.  The mechanism for the 
bleeding events is not well understood.  Ibrutinib may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients 
receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Recommend holding ibrutinib for at least [ADDRESS_534462] minor surgery. 
[IP_ADDRESS] QT prolongation 
Any medications known to cause QT prolongation (Appendix 13.5) should be used with caution; periodic 
ECG and electrolyte monitoring should be considered. For an up to date list of drugs that cause QT 
prolongation, please refer to the following website: www.QTdrugs.org   
6.1.3 Prohibited Concomitant Therapy 
Chemotherapy, anti-cancer immunotherapy, corticosteroids for lymphoma treatment (at doses >10mg 
of prednisone or equivalent), experimental therapy, or radiotherapy are prohibited during the 
Treatment phase. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant use of Systemic Corticosteroids 
Systemic corticosteroid use at doses above 10mg/day (prednisone or equivalent) is prohibited during 
the Treatment Phase. Systemic corticosteroid doses above 10mg/day (prednisone equivalent) are 
allowed for tumor flare reaction treatment (<14 days), ≥ grade 3 rash where clinically indicated, or 
rituximab cytokine release syndrome prophylaxis and treatment of infusion related reactions at any 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
28 
 time. For patients receiving systemic corticosteroids at doses > 10mg/day (prednisone equivalent), a 28 
day washout period prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 is required.  
6.2 Guidelines for Perioperative management of Ibrutinib 
Ibrutinib may increase risk of bleeding with invasive procedures or surgery. The following guidelines 
should be applied for the use of ibrutinib in the perioperative period for subjects who require surgical 
intervention or an invasive procedure while receiving ibrutinib: 
 For any surgery or invasive procedure requiring sutures or staples for closure, ibrutinib should 
be held at least [ADDRESS_534463] 7 days after the 
procedure and restarted at the discretion of the investigator when the surgical site is reasonably 
healed without serosanguinous drainage. 
 For minor procedures (such as central line placement, needle biopsy, thoracentesis, or 
paracentesis) ibrutinib should be held for at least [ADDRESS_534464] is on ibrutinib, it is not necessary to hold ibrutinib for these procedures. 
 For emergency procedures, ibrutinib should be held at least for 7 days after the procedure and 
until the surgical site is reasonably healed.  
7. STUDY PROCEDURES 
Before study entry (Screening Phase), throughout the Treatment Phase, and during Follow-up, various 
clinical and diagnostic laboratory evaluations are outlined. The purpose of obtaining these 
measurements is to ensure adequate safety and tolerability. Clinical evaluations and laboratory studies 
may be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated. The Schedule of Assessments is provided in 
Appendix 1. 
7.[ADDRESS_534465] read, understand, and sign the IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF) before 
any study-specific screening procedures are performed. After signing the ICF, completing all screening

 7.4.6 Adverse Events 
Only laboratory abnormalities which result in signs or symptoms that require intervention or follow up 
and are considered clinically significant should be recorded as AEs.  See Section 10 for more details. All 
other AEs whether serious or non-serious will be entered in PDMS/CORe (the electronic case report 
form) from the time of signed and dated ICF up until [ADDRESS_534476], PET/CT and MRI Scans 
A CT scan (with contrast unless contraindicated) of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis are required for 
disease assessmen t. A “diagnostic quality” combined PET/CT with IV and PO (or water) contrast is an 
acceptable alternative to CT scans.  In addition, if independent CTs are performed, a PET can also be 
used to augment tumor assessment. In the case where a CT with contrast is contraindicated, an 
alternative would be an MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  
In general, follow-up assessments will be done by [CONTACT_5291]. PET-CT scan is encouraged and should be 
done at baseline and repeated to confirm complete remission and/or at treatment discontinuation, 
unless the subject’s insurance will not cover a PET as part of standard of care. In this situation, CTs are 
acceptable alternatives. For lymphomas that are not FDG-avid at screening, PET does not need to be 
repeated in subsequent assessments.

HIV serologies include antibodies to HIV 1 and 2.  
7.4.14 Creatinine Clearance 
Determination of creatinine clearance using the modified Cockcroft-Gault estimate (utilizing actual body 
weight) should be calculated during the Screening phase, C1D1, C1D8, C1D15, C1D22, C2D1, C2D15 and 
at the start of each subsequent cycle to determine dose of lenalidomide (Table 2).  
7.4.[ADDRESS_534479] 
During screening, two serum pregnancy tests will be required for women of childbearing potential. 
Females of childbearing potential are defined as: all females who are menstruating, amenorrheic from 
previous treatments, under 50 years of age, and/or perimenopausal, and do not qualify for the females 
not of reproductive potential category.   
Females not of reproductive potential are defined as: females who have been in natural menopause for 
at least [ADDRESS_534480] had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, or 
female children who have not started menstruating and will not be required to undergo pregnancy 
testing.Females of reproductive potential must also adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as 
required in the Revlimid REMS® program, Appendix 13.6.  
Urine pregnancy tests should be performed as clinically indicated for women of childbearing potential.  
7.4.16 Bone Marrow Biopsy and Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_423101] 90 days before study 
entry. Thereafter, bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_423102].  Minimal residual disease assessment should be done on marrow using PCR for t(14;18)

9.  STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 General Considerations: 
This is an open-label, Phase 2 study investigating the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib combined with 
rituximab and lenalidomide in previously untreated subjects with FL. The study will include 60 subjects 
in one treatment arm.  
9.1.1 Response Assessment 
Response assessments will be done and recorded by [CONTACT_079]. The response criteria are 
based on the revised criteria for malignant lymphoma described in the Lugano Criteria, international 
Working Group for NHL (Cheson 2014).  
9.1.[ADDRESS_534488] the action taken with the study drugs as a result of an AE or SAE, as 
applicable (e.g., discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of study drugs, as appropriate) and report if 
concomitant and/or additional treatments were given for the event. AEs and SAEs will be reviewed on 
an ongoing basis to identify safety concerns.  
For subjects with a history of Hepatitis B or C, standard of care monitoring for viral reactivation will be 
conducted. Subjects with a history of Hepatitis B will be required to undergo hepatitis B reactivation 
prophylaxis unless contraindicated. 
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study must be 
followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (due to the SAE). 
Janssen and Celgene shall notify the Investigator via an IND Safety Report of the following information: 
Any AE associated with the use of study drug in this study or in other studies that is both serious and 
unexpected, any changes on the investigational brochure or any other safety information that changes 
the risk/benefit profile of ibrutinib or lenalidomide during the conduct of the study; any finding from 
tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects; including reports of 
mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_177184]/her IRB 
promptly of these new serious and unexpected AEs or significant risks to subjects. The Investigator must 
keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_56594], including correspondence with Janssen, Celgene, and the IRB, on file. 
 
9.2 Definition of Analysis Populations 
The following definitions will be used for the efficacy and safety analysis: 
 All treated population: The subjects who enrolled in the study and had at least 1 dose of study 
drug. 
 Response evaluable population: The subjects in the all treated population who have measurable 
disease at baseline and have at least one adequate post-treatment disease assessment by [CONTACT_1275]. 
 Safety analysis population: All enrolled subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug (same 
as the all treated population). 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
[ADDRESS_534489] demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and other baseline characteristics (ECOG PS, disease 
burden, FLIPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005]) will be summarized. Summary statistics will include means, standard deviations, and 
medians for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Compliance parameters 
including number of completed cycles, number of dose modifications, and reasons for discontinuation 
will also be similarly summarized. 
9.3.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS rate at 2 years. Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_423136] 2014 Cheson Lugano criteria. The 2-year PFS rate will be calculated and corresponding 95% CI will 
be derived.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Methods 
The primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints will be conducted based on the all treated population. PFS 
is defined as the time from the treatment start date (Cycle 1, Day 1) until the first date of objectively 
documented progressive disease or date of death from any cause. Patients will be censored at the last 
follow-up date if progression or death has not occurred during follow-up.   If a patient has missing data 
(incomplete CT scan), all other available CT, PET/CT or MRI of the patient will be used for the analysis.  
Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS.  Corresponding 95% CI will be summarized. Cox 
proportional hazards models will be used to assess the effects of patient prognostic factors on time- to-
event endpoints. The final analysis will be performed when the last patient is followed for [ADDRESS_534490] study drug dose.  
9.3.3 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
 CR rate at 120 weeks (± 4 weeks) will be determined by [CONTACT_978] (Cheson, Lugano classification 
2014). The number and percentage of subjects with a CR at 120 weeks will be tabulated.   
 
 ORR  (CR + PR) will be assessed by [CONTACT_177232], Lugano 2014. The number 
and percentage of subjects with an ORR will be tabulated. The best ORR will be recorded.  
 
 DOR will be measured from the time by [CONTACT_177233], whichever is 
recorded first, is met until death or the first date by [CONTACT_177234]. 
Subjects who are progression free and alive at the time of clinical cut-off or have unknown

[ADDRESS_534491] tumor assessment. Subjects with no baseline disease 
assessment will be censored on cycle 1, day 1. Non- responders will be excluded from the 
analysis for DOR. Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate event-free curves, 
median, and 95% CI.  
 
 EFS will be measured from the date of cycle 1, day [ADDRESS_534492] documented 
progression, transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, initiation of new anti-lymphoma 
treatment, or death. Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate event-free curves, 
median, and 95% CI. 
 
 TTNT will be measured from the date of cycle 1, day [ADDRESS_534493] documented 
administration of any anti-lymphoma treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immune therapy, 
radioimmunotherapy, or other experimental therapy). Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used 
to estimate event-free curves, median, and 95% CI. 
 
 OS will be measured from the date of cycle 1, day [ADDRESS_534494]. Kaplan-Meier 
methodology will be used to estimate event-free curves, median, and 95% CI. 
9.3.4 Safety Analysis 
Analysis of safety data will be conducted on the safety population. Safety summaries will include 
tabulations in the form of tables and listings. The frequency (number and percentage) of treatment-
emergent AEs will be reported. Additional AE summaries will include AE frequency by [CONTACT_423137].  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values will be summarized.  
9.3.5 Exploratory Analyses 
The objective is to identify predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers after therapy with rituximab 
plus lenalidomide with ibrutinib in subjects with previously untreated FL and marginal zone lymphoma. 
 Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_177167] 
o PBMC will be stained with multiple antibodies and analyzed with up to 12-parameter 
flow cytometry.  
 Identification of signaling pathways or biomarkers that predict sensitivity or resistance by [CONTACT_158086] (GEP) 
o GEP will be performed on tumor biopsies obtained at baseline in consenting subjects to 
determine predictive biomarkers. The primary focus of the analysis of GEP data will be 
to evaluate the 41-gene effector T cell signature [CONTACT_423154] [36]. But other 
gene signatures specific to other immune cell subsets and tumor signaling pathways, 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
[ADDRESS_534495]-treatment levels will be correlated with ultimate response, and, via landmark 
analysis, with PFS. 
o Pharmacodynamic effects of combination therapy will be assessed in peripheral blood. 
Blood samples will be collected at baseline, Cycle 1, Day 1, Cycle 2, Day 1, and Cycle 7, 
Day 1. Lenalidomide affects multiple immune cell subsets and its effects may be 
assessed by [CONTACT_423138] [24]. 
Since ibrutinib has been shown to inhibit ITK in Th2 cells and skew the polarization of 
CD4+ T cells to Th1 phenotype, we will also assess the ratio of Th1: Th2 cells in the 
PBMC by [CONTACT_423139]. Furthermore, alteration of various cytokines and 
chemokines will be assessed in the plasma by [CONTACT_423140]. The various cellular 
subsets measured at baseline will be compared with on-therapy time points and 
correlated with best clinical response and PFS

[ADDRESS_534498] received the combination treatment, for patient safety we 
will monitor the prohibitive toxicity, defined as any treatment-related death or frequent discontinuation of 
treatment during cycles 1 and 2. The prohibitive toxicity rate of 15% or higher will be considered unacceptable. 
The prior probability of the rate is assumed to follow a Beta (0.3, 1.7) distribution with two patients worth of 
information. We will monitor patients by a cohort size of 10.  At any time after at least [ADDRESS_534499] 
completed toxicity evaluations, the trial will be stopped if the following statement is true 
Pr[prohibitive toxicity rate > 15% | data]  > 0.95, 
which means that the trial will be stopped for toxicity if the posterior probability of the rate being greater 
than 15% is greater 95%.  
 
Patients will be monitored by a cohort size of 10 according to the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_423104] 1 and 2.

Any treatment-related death occurring beyond cycle [ADDRESS_534500] quality complaints as defined below: 
 
This Study has been designated as an interventional study.  As such, all adverse events regardless of 
causality and special situations excluding those from subjects not exposed to a Janssen Medicinal 
Product and product quality complaints with or without an adverse event as described in this section 
will be reported from the time a subject has signed and dated an Informed Consent Form (ICF) until 
completion of the subject’s last study-related procedure (which may include contact [CONTACT_20687]- up 
safety).  Serious adverse events will be reported for [ADDRESS_534501] is: Ibrutinib (Imbruvica)  
10.[ADDRESS_534502] administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational or non-investigational) product. For the purposes of this study, AEs include events which 
are either new or represent detectable exacerbations of pre-existing conditions. The following are not 
considered an AE: 
 Pre-existing condition: A pre-existing condition is not considered an AE unless the severity, 
frequency, or character of the event worsens during the study period. 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
46 
  Pre-planned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423106], but rather a therapeutic intervention. However, if during the pre-planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423107], the event will be considered an SAE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14150], solely for the 
administration of treatment, or due to long travel distances are not SAEs. 
 Diagnostic testing and procedures: Testing and procedures should not be reported as AEs or 
SAEs but rather the cause for the test or procedure should be reported. 
 Asymptomatic treatment related lymphocytosis: This event should not be considered an AE. 
Patients with treatment-related lymphocytosis should remain on treatment and continue with 
all study-related procedures. 
 
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Event 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the patient, in the view of 
the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not 
include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Is suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product 
 Is medically important 
 Development of a secondary malignancy, excluding superficial, non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma 
in situ. 
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is also 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
 Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse events. Any important 
medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_223857], IND Office. 
 All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must be reported 
to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. 
Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Serious 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
47 
 Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, 
expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working 
days of knowledge of the event). 
 All life-threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the study drug, must have a 
written report submitted within 24 hours  (next working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety 
Project Manager in the IND Office.   
 Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety reporting to the 
IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until [ADDRESS_534503] returned to baseline, 
progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event. 
 Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_534504] be reported to the IND Office. This will include the development of a secondary 
malignancy, except superficial, non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ. 
 
Reporting to FDA: 
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety Project Manager IND Office) 
according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_177191], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the 
sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy. Safety data includes adverse events, product 
quality complaints (PQCs), and special situations including pregnancies. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease 
state ) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study, or within  [ADDRESS_534505]’s last 
dose of lenalidomide or ibrutinib, are considered immediately reportable events. Lenalidomide and/or 
ibrutinib are to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC , using the Janssen Serious Adverse 
Event Form - and Celgene Drug Safety using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form,  immediately by [CONTACT_423141]. The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one 
experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify 
Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC –  using the Janssen Serious Adverse Event Form, and Celgene Drug Safety 
using the Pregnancy Follow-Up Report Form, immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either 
normal or abnormal outcome). If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or 
therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal 
outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
48 
 and Celgene Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form.  
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_534506] should also be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC using 
the Janssen Serious Adverse Event Form, and Celgene Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other 
appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. Male Subjects 
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male subject 
taking lenalidomide should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised 
to call their healthcare provider immediately. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_423108]-up. This includes ensuring the reports are fully investigated and 
thoroughly documented by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_423109]-up information is summarized e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], coroner’s repor ts, autopsy results and recorded on the appropriate forms. 
Because the effect of the Janssen medicinal product on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of 
male subjects exposed to a Janssen medicinal product will be reported by [CONTACT_423142] [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of their knowledge of the event  using the Serious Adverse Event 
Form.  Depending on local legislation this may require prior consent of the partner. 
Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant 
will be required. 
 
10.1.3 Severity Criteria (Grade 1- 5) 
Definitions found in the CTCAE (version 4.03) will be used for grading the severity of AEs. The CTCAE 
v4.[ADDRESS_534507] 
experiences an AE not listed in the CTCAEv4.03, the following grading system should be used to assess 
severity: 
 Grade 1 (Mild AE): experiences that are usually transient, requiring no special treatment and do 
not interfere with the sub ject’s daily activities  
 Grade 2 (Moderate AE): experiences that introduce some level of inconvenience or concern to 
the subject and that may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_11884] 
 Grade 3 (Severe AE): experiences that are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly interrupt the 
subject’s usual daily activity, and require systemic drug therapy or other treatment  
 Grade 4 (Life threatening or disabling AE): experiences that cause the subject to be in imminent 
danger or death 
 Grade 5 (Death related AE): experiences that result in subject death. 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
49 
 10.1.4 Causality (Attribution) 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_423110]: 
 Not related: another cause of the AE is more plausible, a temporal sequence cannot be 
established with the onset of the AE and administration of the investigational product; or a 
causal relationship is biologically implausible 
 Unlikely: The current knowledge or information about the AE indicates that a relationship to the 
investigational product is unlikely.  
 Possibly related: There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and 
administration of the investigational product, but the AE could also be attributed to concurrent 
or underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or procedures.  
 Related: The AE is clearly related to use of the investigational product. 
10.1.5  Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information 
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable 
product reference safety information. For a medicinal product(s) with a marketing authorization, the 
expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_423143].

10.1.6 J&J Medicinal Product 
For the purposes of this study, the Janssen medicinal product is: Ibrutinib (Imbruvica)  
10.[ADDRESS_534508], an identifiable patient, and identifiable reporter, the 
following events represent Special Reporting Situations: 
• overdose of a  Janssen medicinal product  
• pregnancy exposure (maternal and paternal) 
• exposure to a medicinal product from breastfeeding  
• suspected abuse/misuse of a medicinal  Janssen product 
• inadvertent or accidental exposure to a medicinal  Janssen product  
• any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of a Janssen medicinal 
product 
• unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a  Janssen medicinal product 
• medication error involving a  Janssen product (with or without patient exposure to the medicinal  
Janssen product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976]) 
• suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product.

These safety events may not meet the definition of an adverse event; however, from Janssen 
Scientific Affairs, LLC perspective, they are treated in the same manner as adverse events. Special 
situations should be recorded on the Adverse Event page of the CRF. 
 
10.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Procedures 
[IP_ADDRESS]  All Adverse Events 
All subjects who receive treatment will be considered evaluable for toxicity (safety analysis population). 
All serious events will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until completion of 
the subject’s last study related procedure (which may include contact [CONTACT_423144]). Serious 
adverse events will be reported for [ADDRESS_534509] immediately report to Janssen Scientific Affairs any serious 
adverse event and Special Reporting Situations, whether or not considered drug related. Study 
endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all-cause mortality) must be reported in accordance 
with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the 
event (e.g., death as a result of anaphylactic reaction or fatal hepatic necrosis). In that case, the 
investigator must immediately report the event to Janssen Scientific Affairs. The Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_423111]-serious adverse events and report them to Janssen Scientific Affairs according to the 
timetable for reporting as specified either in the protocol or to fulfill regulatory reporting requirements. 
For each subject, AEs SAEs, and Special Reporting Situations should be recorded after informed consent 
is obtained until the subject has completed participation in the study as follows: 
• A Serious Adverse event or Special Reporting Situations must be reported if it occurs during a 
subject’s participation in the Study (whether receiving Study Product or not) and within [ADDRESS_534510] completes 
his/her participation in the Study must be followed until any of the following occurs: 
• the event resolves or stabilizes; 
• the event returns to baseline condition or value (if a baseline value is available); 
• the event can be attributed to agents(s) other than the Study Product, or to factors unrelated to 
Study conduct. 
• It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after demonstration of due 
diligence with follow -up efforts)  
•  
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Special Reporting Situations 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
[ADDRESS_534511]’s source records. Investigators must record in the CRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_423112] a Janssen medicinal product.  
 
The adverse event recorded should not be a procedure or a clinical measurement (i.e. a laboratory value 
or vital sign) but should reflect the reason for the procedure or the diagnosis based on the abnormal 
measurement. 
Preexisting conditions that worsen in severity or frequency during the Study should also be recorded (a 
preexisting condition that does not worsen is not an adverse event). 
Further, a procedure or surgery is not an adverse event; rather, the event leading to the procedure or 
surgery is considered an adverse event. Any event requiring in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423113] a subject’s participation in a tria l must be reported as an SAE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423114]: 
 Reasons described in the Protocol, e.g. drug administration, Protocol-required testing 
 Surgery or procedure planned prior to entry into the Study. 
If, in th e Principal Investigator’s judgment, a clinical significant worsening from baseline is observed in 
any laboratory or other test parameter (e.g. electrocardiogram (ECG), angiogram), physical exam 
finding, or vital sign, a corresponding clinical adverse event should be recorded. 
If a specific medical diagnosis has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded as the 
adverse event, whenever possible.  However, a complete description of the signs, symptoms and 
investigations which led to the diagnosis should be provided. For example, if clinically significant 
elevations of liver function tests are known to be secondary to hepatitis, “hepatitis” and not “elevated 
liver function tests” should be recorded. If the cause is not known, the abnormal test or finding should 
be recorded as an adverse event, using appropriate medical terminology (e.g. thrombocytopenia, 
peripheral edema, QT prolongation).  
Janssen Scientific Affairs will provide to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_423115]/S[LOCATION_003]R (Serious 
Unexpected Suspect Adverse Reaction) reports generated by [CONTACT_423145].  
 Toxicities that are not serious are AEs, and they will be required to be entered/recorded into 
PDMS/CORe. 
 Toxicities that become serious will be required to be entered/recorded into PDMS/CORe and reported 
using the eSAE application. [A paper copy can be printed for you to fax to the company.]

a. For each Cycle, assessment is assumed to be on Day 1 unless otherwise specified.  
b. In subjects who discontinue study therapy without documented disease progression, every effort should be made to continue 
monitoring their disease status as per the follow- up schedule until (1) the start of new anti-cancer treatment, (2) documented 
disease progression, (3) death, or (4) the end of the study, whichever occurs first. Survival assessments will continue up to [ADDRESS_534527] study drug.  
c. Treatment cycles are 28 days; however the treatment cycle interval may be increased due to toxicity according to the dose 
modification guidelines provided in Section 5.4. If the interval is increased, all procedures except for response assessment should be 
performed based on the new dosing schedule 
d. Written consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol specific procedure. Results of a test performed prior to th e 
subject signing consent as part of routine clinical management are acceptable in lieu of a screening test if performed within the 
specified time frame (e.g., within [ADDRESS_534528] dose of trial treatment). Screening number will be assigned when the 
study informed consent is signed. 
e. Record all medications taken within 28 days of screening visit. Concomitant medications – Enter new medications started through 
the treatment phase as well as up to [ADDRESS_534529] adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as required in the 
Revlimid REMS® program. 
j. Coagulation factors (PT/INR and aPTT) should be tested as part of the screening procedures for all subjects. For subjects requiring 
anticoagulation during the study (warfarin is contraindicated) appropriate coagulation tests should be done when clinically indicated 
to monitor anticoagulation. 
k. These screening tests need to be finalized prior to the first dose of rituximab. HCV RNA will be performed if Hep C Ab is positive. 
l. All subjects will have bone marrow biopsy/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_177198] (within 90 days of study entry). Subsequent bone marrow 
assessments will only be performed in subjects who have bone marrow involvement at baseline to confirm disease response (CR). 
m. Biomarker blood samples will be collected and processed as outlined in Section 7.4.18. On Cycle 1, Day 1,  Cycle 1, Day 15, Cycle 2, 
Day [ADDRESS_534530] will be collected prior to rituximab dosing. At the time of documented PD, bloo d 
biomarker collection should be performed (±4 weeks). 
n. If a fresh biopsy is being pursued as part of standard clinical practice, for consenting patients, fresh tumor can be collected as 
outlined in Section 7.4.19.  If this is not possible, archival tumor tissue (paraffin embedded) when available should be collected at 
Screening for biomarker analyses for consenting patients. At the time of confirmed PD, if a tumor biopsy is planned as part o f 
routine clinical practice, for consenting patients, a fresh tumor sample should be collected for biomarker analyses and processed as 
outlined in Section 7.4.19. 
o. Disease response assessment is based upon Cheson 2014 lymphoma response criteria. “Diagnostic quality” PET -CT with oral 
contrast/or water and IV contrast should be performed at Screening unless there is a contraindication or not covered by [CONTACT_22241]. If 
CT scans have already been completed, a PET can be performed at Screening. PET/CT or CT and PET should be repeated to confirm 
complete remission and/or at treatment discontinuation if covered by [CONTACT_22241]. For lymphomas that are not FDG-avid, PET does 
not need to be repeated in subsequent assessments. CTs of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with IV contrast will otherwise be 
conducted at baseline for those who do not undergo diagnostic quality PET-CT, at approximately Cycle 4, Day 1 (± 7 days), Cycle 7, 
Day 1 (± 7 days ), at the completion of treatment and during the follow up phase. During the follow-up phase, response assessment 
should occur every 12 weeks (± 2weeks) for 4 assessments, then every 24 weeks (±4 weeks) until study completion, PD, withdrawal 
of consent, death, or lost to follow up, whichever comes first. When a contraindication prevents CT, an MRI of the chest, 
abdomen/pelvis can be substituted. 
p. In subjects who discontinue study therapy without confirmed disease progression, a radiological assessment should be performed at 
the time of treatment discontinuation (i.e. date of discontinuation ± 2 weeks). If previous scan was obtained within 4 weeks prior to 
the date of discont inuation, then a repeat scan at treatment discontinuation isn’t mandatory.

If patients meet all the above criteria and are without B symptoms (drenching night 
sweats, fever that is non-infectious, weight loss > 10% of body weight, fatigue, or 
pruritus), they are considered low tumor burden by [CONTACT_79444] D’Etude des 
Lymphomes Folliculares (GELF) criteria. (Khal. ASH Education 2012) If they do not 
meet all of the above criteria, they are considered high tumor burden.

ureter.   Ureteral stents work by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -establishing or maintaining patency of the ureter in 
conditions of obstruction or injury.  Stents passively dilate the ureter, allowing urine to flow 
both through and around the stent, and are indicated when t here is ureteral obstruction with 
or without  renal insufficiency, secondary to nephrolithiasis, malignancy, or other pathologic 
process es.  Additionally, they can be used as a prophylactic measure after endoscopic 
procedures involving the ureter, or surgical repair of the ureter such as in ureteral 
anastomoses.   
Unfortunately, despi[INVESTIGATOR_609210] 60’s, stent related symptoms are 
common in patients after s tent insertion and continue to be a challenge to manage.  Overall 
quality of life is impaired in 45% - 80% of patien ts with ureteral stents in place  1.   Stent 
related symptoms occur in up to 80% of patients  following stent insertion.  These include: 
storage urinary symptoms  such as urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, dysuria, hematuri a, 
stent colic (flank/SP pain), and incomplete emptying or urinary incontinence.   To date, 
various methods have been investigated and employed in an ef fort to alleviate these  
symptoms, from various stent designs to pharmacotherapy.   With respect to pharmacologic 
management of stent symptoms, various agents have been investigated, including 
intravesical pharmacologic therapy 2, periuret eral injection of botox 3, selective alpha -1 
blockers 4,  and a nticholinergic agents 5.

placement of a ureteral stent for urolithiasis .  This objective will be ass essed by [CONTACT_609213] (the Urinary Stent 
Symptom Questionnaire), which is a validated tool used to assess stent symptoms1.  We felt 
that a 15%  further  decrease in the i ndex score in the experimental group, compared to the 
control group would represent a clinically significant improvement in urinary symptoms, 
based on the prior studies evaluating lower urinary tract sympt oms in patients with stents. 
We hypothesize that combination therapy with Tamsulosin and T olterodine ER will yield 
greater symptom relief than tamsulosin alone.   In addition, we hypothesize that a longer 
duration of treatment of Tolterodine ER, 2 weeks pri or to insertion of the stent, will yield 
greater symptom relief than initiation of Tolterodine ER after stent placement or tamsulosin 
alone.   
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:  
This is a prospect ive, double blind, randomized control trial.    
STUDY SITE  
This st udy was originally planned to take place at UW Health, Meriter Health Sciences, 
Vista Medical Center East and University of Manitoba. Three of the sites were unable to 
recruit patients to the study and have dropped out of the study: Meriter Health Sciences , 
Vista Medical Center East and University of Manitoba. Thus, the study was amended in 2014 
to be a single site study conducted only at the UW Health.

STUDY ACTIVITIES  
Patients who will be undergo ing urinary stent insertion during the management of 
renal or ureteral stones , or other conditions requiring endoscopy will be randomized into 
the combination or monotherapy arm, based on a computer generated randomization 
scheme, and will be enrolled into the study arm in a blinded manner.   The study is intended 
to be double -blin ded.  The drug kit will linked to the randomization number and both the 
investigator and patient will thus be blinded to the treatment. All patients will be required 
to provide a signed informed consent, which  outlines the differences in the two treatment 
arms and study objectives.   Patients will be provided the corresponding  pi[INVESTIGATOR_609211] -filled 
vials, based on their group assignment.  Initially, the study used a [ADDRESS_807826] stent removal . In the 7 -day regimen, 80 patients were 
enrolled  and completed the study  (15 patients  enrolled but  withdrawn, 95 patients in total ).

PATIENT SCREENING AND RECRUITMENT  
Potential s ubjects will be identified by [CONTACT_609214], PCNL or stent placement is scheduled.  These subjects will be screened for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria by [CONTACT_609215] . A waiver of patient screening 
is requested in the current application.  If inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, the surgeon 
will ask the patient if he or she is interested in talking with a study team member for a study 
that he or she is eligible. One the patients’ permission  is obtained , a member of the research 
team  will approach the patient for enrollment. Subjects will be recruited by [CONTACT_609216] -investigators, or by a research coordinator.  The 
patient must consent to participate as evidenc ed by [CONTACT_609217], study -specific, IRB -approved 
informe d consent form before any study specific data may be collected and recorded.   
 We have requested a waiver of patient screening. We believe  that the screening 
process will not pose more than minimal ris ks to subjects or adversely affect the rights and 
welfare of the subjects. The screening process only consists of reviews pre -existing data. No 
patient care or outcomes are affected as a result of screening. The surgeon or study 
coordinator will only revie w the medical record that is relevant for inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. No data will be collected in this phase. The exclusion criteria for the current study 
include pre -exsiting LUTS, active UTI,  contraindication to anticholinergic medication, 
current an ticholinergic use,  chronic pelvic pain syndromes, pregnant females, and under 18 
years of age. In the Urology clinic, a significant amount of patients who undergo stone 
9 
University of Wisconsin -Madison  
Study #: 2017 -0755  
IRB Approval Date: 7 /17/[ADDRESS_807829] will be randomized to 
one of the two arms (tamsulosin + placebo versus tamsulosin + tolterodine) using a 
computerized randomization scheme .   
 
STUDY DRUG/INTERVENTION  
The study drugs of interest are Tamsulosin and Tolterodine ER, both of which are 
routinely used in urology.  The UW pharmacy will supply the study drugs and placebo.   Each 
of the study drugs and placebo will be provided in standard drug vials.  Under the original, 
7-day study treatment regimen, each vial contained 7 pi[INVESTIGATOR_392915].  In 2014, the study was 
amended to add a 21 -day treatment regimen.  This replacement study will use only the 21 -
day treatment regimen, and the drug vials will contain 21 pi[INVESTIGATOR_392915].  The placebo capsule will 
be sim ilar in color and appearance to the Tolterodine capsule, and will be provided by [CONTACT_609218].  Patients may continue to use any prior medications concurrently  with either 
of the study drugs, and no washout period is necessary.  
TAMSULOSIN   
10 
University of Wisconsin -Madison  
Study #: 2017 -0755  
IRB Approval Date: 7 /17/2017  
Tamsulosin  is a selective α 1a-blocker (FlomaxTM), generic since 2009. It is an 
antagonist of α1 -mediated contraction of prostate, bladder and proximal urethral smooth 
muscle, and a s such, reduces urethral pressure and resistance, bladder outlet resistance, 
bladder h yperactiv ity, and consequently LUTS.  Its  adverse effects include headache, 
dizziness, asthenia, nasal congestion, retrograde ejaculation, and a rare reversible condition 
known as floppy iris syndrome, which is only relevant if patients are undergoing cata ract 
surgery.  
TOLTERODINE ER  
 Toleterodine ER is an anticholinergic (antimuscurinic) agent, which  is used as one of 
the firs t line agents for detrusor over activity.  It is given as once -daily dosing for overactive 
bladder symptoms, and even used in BPH pat ients e xhibiting bladder symptoms.  It s side -
effects include xerostomia, xeropthalmia, gastroparesis, constipation, drowsiness, acute 
urinary retention, but unlike other drugs of this class, e.g. oxybutynin, tolterodine ER causes 
little to no  cognitive imp airment due to it s larger molecular weight which precludes crossing 
of the BBB.  
SAFETY AND MONITORING  
Regular inquiries of study flow, pertaining to patient recruitment, randomization, 
patient compliance (with medication and completing questionnaires) and adverse events 
will be scheduled to occur after the first week and subsequently every two weeks during the 
active patient enlistment phase.  Any adverse events/side effects will be monitored as per 
11 
University of Wisconsin -Madison  
Study #: 2017 -0755  
IRB Approval Date: 7 /17/[ADDRESS_807830] 
reactions to the study d rugs to the urology clinic or on -call urology staff .   
No significant  adverse events are anticipated with either of the study drugs , as they 
are routinely used in everyday urology practice .  The pat ient will report side effects  if and 
when they occur ; the drug will be stopped if continuation is deemed inappropriate.  Any 
adverse events or unanticipated problems will be recorded and the offending drug will be 
stopped, and the patient counseled accordi ngly.   If a patient has side effects that precludes 
their ongoing participation in the study, they will be withdrawn and considered a study 
drop -out.   All measures will be in effect to prevent breaches  of confidentiality and/or 
emotional upset.  
Patients a re instructed to contact [CONTACT_609219].  The surgeons who 
perform these procedures are also members of the study team, and  will ensure that all 
patients’ clinical care will not be influence d due to study participation . We confirm that study 
participation will not delay needed clinical care in the event that an enrolled subject requires 
stent placement sooner than anticipated.  We will only include patients whose stent 
placement will not be delayed as a result of study participation .  If the patient ha s the stent 
placed in the interim or ha s discontinued medications, he or she  will be excluded from the 
study.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS & POWER CALCULATIONS:  
In 2014, a change of protocol was approved that extended the study treatment to 21 
days.  Our sample size calculation  in the 21 -day regimen  was based on the recommended 
sample size calculations by [CONTACT_609220] 1.  The authors’ calculations 
were based on the results of their validation studies that compared mean domain score and 
standard deviation di fferences between stented and control patients, using a [ADDRESS_807831] 
(p<0.05).  The percentage change (15%) translates to an absolute change in score by [ADDRESS_807832] 
deviation of 6.5 points between the tamsulosin and placebo arm 4 to confirm the previous 
authors’ sample size.  With an expected decrease of [ADDRESS_807833] deviation (6.5),  a two -tailed t -test (p=0.05) and 
power of 0.80, our calculation yielded 43 patients per arm.  Given the relatively similar 
numbers from the two calculations, we opted to us e the more conservative sample size of 53 
patients per arm as the data collection endpoint .   
We are assessing for both an absolute and relative change in the USSQ scores.  
1. We will be assessing for a relative change of 4 actual points (which translates to a  15% 
change, as per Joshi et al’s validation study) within each group from immediately post stent 
insertion at 24 hours compared to day 5.  
2. We will also assess for a change in scores between groups, i.e. comparing the mean intra -
group score change as descr ibed in  1 (i.e., immediately post stent insertion at 24 hours 
compared to day 5) .   
13 
University of Wisconsin -Madison  
Study #: 2017 -0755  
IRB Approval Date: 7 /17/2017  
 
The questionnaire responses will be analyzed using cross tabulations and descriptive statistics to assess 
differences between groups. Paired t-tests will be used to assess within -group change in scores from the 
USSQ (comparison between post -op, i.e. at 48 hours, and day 5) and other discriminant properties.   T-
tests will be used to assess inter -group score changes.  
The intent -to-treat principle  will be employed in the event subjects have to withdraw from their 
assigned group, although this is not expected given that both treatment medications are used 
extensively in urology, and both treatment regimens are occasionally employed based on anecdota l 
physician experience.   
 
 
DATA SECURITY:  
All information obtained from the medical reco rd and questionnaires will be kept secure and 
only accessible by [CONTACT_609221].  Data collected will be stored into a 
Microsoft® Excel database by [CONTACT_609222][INVESTIGATOR_609212].  All 
information will be de -identified and coded prior to database entry.  The key for the code 
will be stored on a different computer for safety.

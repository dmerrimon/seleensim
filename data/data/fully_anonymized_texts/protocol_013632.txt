2.1. Background 
2.1.1. Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
On December 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of severe pneumonia of unknown 
etiology in the city of Wuhan to the WHO.   The China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(China CDC) rapi[INVESTIGATOR_668526] a novel betacoronavirus , SARS -CoV-2, as the etiologic agent with 
approximately 70% genetic homology with Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7531] 
(SARS -CoV) and 50% homology with Middle Eastern Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7531] 
(MERS -CoV) . In the ensuing [ADDRESS_1039105] intensified.   
 
 
   
 
After an incubation period of between 2 and 14 days  from exposure, approximately 81% of patients 
develop uncomplicated illness characterized by [CONTACT_758975]-specific symptoms 
including fever, non- productive cough, dyspnea and myalgias  1,7-12. Approximately, 14% of 
symptomatic patients develop severe illness often defined by a respi[INVESTIGATOR_7137] e >30  breaths per minute ,

of patients become critically ill with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], shock and multi -organ dysfunction 7. Although 
asymptomatic infection has been d escribed, the relative proportion of patients who never develop 
symptoms is not known13,14. 
Risk factors for sev ere disease include older age, male sex, and metabolic syndrome comorbidities 
including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity.  Markers of a systemic inflammatory 
response have been reported in association with disease progression and death including D -Dimer, 
lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) and C- reactive protein (CRP ) 2,8-11,15,16.  Additionally, cytokine 
levels including interleukin ( IL)1β, IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, granulocyte- colony stimulating factor 
(GCSF ), granulocyte- macrophage colony- stimulating factor ( GMCSF ), interferon gamma (IFN γ), 
inducible protein -10 ( IP-10), m onocyte chemoattractant protein -1 ( MCP1 ), macrophage 
inflammatory protein 1 alpha ( MIP1α), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta ( MIP1β), tumor 
necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα), platelet -derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and vascular endothelial 
growth fa ctor ( VEGF ) levels were increased among patients admitted to the intensive care unit 
(ICU) compared with non- ICU patients and healthy adults  9. Though low overall relative to acute

week of illness ( Figure 1) with long- term viral RNA persistence potentially associated with 
severity of illn ess (Figure 2) 1,3,5,16,17.  The median time to viral RNA clearance is approximately  
11 days for mild disease and 21 days in pati ents with severe or critical illness (Figure 2) 2,17. 
Increased viral loads in addition to prolonged virus replication  in patients with severe illness 
suggest that viral loads maybe a useful surrogate for assessing severity in COVID -19.  
Viral RNA detection is also dependent upon sample type , with evidence of prolonged viral RNA 
detection in lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_758941] ( Figure 1  and Figure 3) 1-3,5,16,17. Daily sampling of the upper and 
lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_758942], in general , viral RNA in OP swabs are elevated in initial samples 
and already on the decline at the time of presentation whereas sputum samples peak during the 
first week of symptoms and decline more slowly  5.

a sample on each day is shown in the table below the plot. D=days after symptom onset. S=s aliva. E=endotracheal 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_758943]. While infectious virus was readily isolated from 
clinical samples in a single study, it was again dependent on  sample type, viral load,  and timing. 
In the only study to date to evaluate infectious virus kinetics, infectious virus was successfully 
isolated from 17% of OP swabs and from 83% of sputum samples  but only from samples collected 
within the first week from symptom onset and only in those that contained >106 viral RNA 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL (Figure 4 ). No infectious virus was isolated beyond Day [ADDRESS_1039107] between 
an infected and susceptible individual  18.  Although viral RNA has been detected in air samples  
within airborne isolation rooms, airborne transmission is not believed to be a major driver of 
transmission based on current evidence  19. Recent reports indicate that human -to-human 
transmission in China is largely driven by [CONTACT_758976] w ith secondary attack rates of 
3-11%14,18,20.  Among 344 clusters including 1308 of 1836 reported cases in Guangdong, 
approximately 78- 85% occurred within families  18. Identification of interve ntions to interrupt 
household and community transmission could have a profound impact on the pandemic at large as 
well as slow the surge of patients requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_758944].

Confidential 21 2.2. Rationale  
Antiviral therapeutic interventions that reduce infectious virus production could play a key role in 
decreasing community transmission, decreasing surge on healthcare facilities, and potentially 
reduce clinical complications of infection. This “ treatment as prevention” approach has the 
potential to reduce the burden of COVID -[ADDRESS_1039108] 
acting antiviral.  
 
 
 EIDD -2801 is the 5’- isobutyrate prodrug of the broadly active, direct acting antiviral 
ribonucleoside analogue EIDD -1931, which inhibits replication of multiple viral pathogens from 
multiple RNA families. Further clinical information is needed to determine safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral activity in humans.   
2.3. Preclinical Data  
2.3.1. Mechanism of A ction  
The primary mechanism of action of EIDD -2801 is inhibition of viral RNA replication  by 
[CONTACT_758977] -1931-5’- monophosphate metabolite into the viral RNA genome 
resulting in induction of viral error catastrophe.  Upon incorporation into nascent chain RNA, 
EIDD-1931-5’-monophosphate induces increased mutational frequency in the viral genome 
resulting in the production of non- viable viru s. Following oral delivery, EIDD -2801 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_758945] -1931 which 
is in turn phosphorylated into a tri -phosphate (EIDD -2601) that can pair with either guanosine or 
adenosine and can substitute for either CTP or UTP , respectively,  resulting in an accumulation of

Confidential 22 mutations that increase with each cycle of viral replication  21. Additionally, the active  metabolite , 
EIDD-1931-5’-triphosphate, may act as a chain terminator and arrest viral replication via a next 
nucleoside effect.  Given this dual mechanism of action, it is anticipated that there will be a high 
barrier to the development of resistance.  
 
 
2.3.2. In Vitro Evidence  
Antiviral activity of EIDD -[ADDRESS_1039109] epi[INVESTIGATOR_378917]4.  Using 
a clinical is olate of SARS -CoV- 2, EID D-1931 exhibited an average half -maximum inhibitory 
concentration (IC 50) of 0.3µ M and a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50) of >10 µ M (Figure 5)  4. 
A dose- dependent reduction in infectious virus titers was observed during treatment in a human 
lung epi[INVESTIGATOR_114239], Calu -[ADDRESS_1039110] gene expression at doses up to

EIDD- 2801 has not been used prophylactically or therapeutically in patients with COVID -19; 
however, EIDD- 2801 has been studied in a single and multiple ascending dose study in healthy 
volunteers (Study EIDD -2801-1001) . Preliminary data from this study showed that doses of

the participant’s health.   
Enrollment in a  Phase I study of EID D-2801 (Study EIDD -2801-1001) in 130 healthy volunteers 
has completed.  No serious AEs were reported and no trends of increased frequency or severity of 
AEs with higher doses of EIDD-2801 were observed . No clinically significant findings or dose -
related trends were observed in clinical laboratory, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG) data. 
 
 
 Further details for EIDD -2801-[ADDRESS_1039113], the study team will notify 
participants and will advise appropriate medical follow up when indicated.   
EIDD- 2801 and EIDD-1931 were shown to be mutagenic (Ames positive) in a bacterial 
mutagenesis assay with and without metabolic activation.  
 
Given the anticipated short -duration of treatment for COVID -19 (eg, 
5 days), EIDD -[ADDRESS_1039114] a benefit/risk profile that supports further clinical 
development.

is associated with this routine medical diagnostic procedure with no reported risk.  
2.5.3. Risks of  Self-Nasal Mid -Turbinate Swab S ampling  
For participants enrolled at applicable sites only , this optional procedure may be self -administered 
on Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28.  No reported risks are associated with this procedure. 
2.5.4. Risks of Oropharyngeal S ampling  
For participants enrolled at applicable sites only , this optional procedure may be nurse-
administered on Day s 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28.  Temporary discomfort is associated with this routine 
medical diagnostic procedure with no reported risk. 
2.5.5. Risk of Blood Collection  
Blood collection may cause pain, bruising, and occasionally a feeling of lightheadedness or 
fainting.  Rarely, it may  be associated with an infection at the site of blood drawing.  
2.5.6. Risks of Pregnancy and U se in N ursing Women  
Treatment with EIDD -[ADDRESS_1039115] be taken to avoid pregnancy during 
the study and for 50 days  after completion of EIDD -2801 dosing in female participants  and for 
100 days after completion of EIDD -2801 dosing in female partners of male participants .  
 
2.5.7. Risk of Exposure to COVID -19 
There is the potential risk for increased transmission of SARS -CoV- 2 to study team members. 
Precautions will b e taken  to prevent this. Home visits will be carried out by [CONTACT_758978] (gown, gloves, N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521], face 
shield). Wherever possible, single use testing supplies will be used, and other testing equipment 
will be wiped down with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -approved disinfectant between each use. The nurse will perform 
study procedures with each participant on an individual basis in a separate room. Study participants 
will be encouraged to use their own devices to complete online questionnaires and symptom 

Protocol EIDD-2801-[ADDRESS_1039116] information in order to carry out study procedures, but this information will not be used as study 
data (it will not be entered into the study database). In the early phase of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], a COVID -[ADDRESS_1039117] SARS -CoV- 2 that could  make it  useful for treatment and/or prevention  
of COVID-19.  
In the absence of an approved therapeutic to reduce progression of illness in COVID -19 and 
transmission of SARS -CoV-2, new antiviral therapeutics represent an urgent public health need. 
 
 
  
2.6. Justification for Dose  
In a recent Phase I safety study  (Study EIDD -2801-1001) a total of 130 healthy volunteers were 
enrolled. Sixty- four participants  received a single dose of between 50 and 1600 mg EIDD-2801 or 
placebo; 56 participants received multiple dose of between 50 and 800 mg EIDD-2801 or placebo 
BID for 5.5 days; and 10  participants received a single dose of 200 mg EIDD -2801 in the fed state 
followed by a single dose of 200 mg EIDD-2801 in the fasted state after a washout period of 14 
days, or vice versa.  Among participants who received single doses of EIDD -1801 or placebo, a  greater proportion of 
participants  report ed AEs following administration of placebo (43.8%) than following 
administration of EIDD-2801 (35.4%). One moderate AE (head ache) was reported by 1 participant 
following administration of EIDD -2801 at the 400- mg dose level , and 2 moderate AEs (nausea 
and headache) were reported by [ADDRESS_1039118] frequently reported AE  was headache, which was reported by 18.8% of 
participants  who were administered placebo and 12.5% of participants  who were administered 
EIDD-2801.  
Among participants who received multiple ascending doses  of EIDD -2801 or placebo BID over 
5.5 days, a greater proportion report ed AEs following administration of placebo (50.0%) than 
following administration of EIDD-2801 (42.9%). With the exception of [ADDRESS_1039119] frequently reported AE  was diarrhea, which was 
reported by 7.1% of participants who were administered EIDD -2801 and 7.1% of participants who

Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP   15 November 2020 
 
Confidential 27 were administered placebo. One participant had an AE of mild, truncal, maculopapular, pruritic 
rash following multiple doses of 800 -mg EIDD-2801, which was considered by [CONTACT_758979]; this AE  resulted in early discontinuation of the study drug dosing on 
Day 3. The participant  was administered a topi[INVESTIGATOR_758946] -histamines, and the AE resolved 
after [ADDRESS_1039120] evaluation, 3 participants  reported 1 AE  each, all of which 
were mild in severity.   
There were no serious AE s rep orted in this study and there were no trends of increased frequency 
or severity of AE s with higher doses of EIDD-2801.  
There were no clinically significant findings in clinical laboratory, vital signs, or ECG data.  
 
no 
clinically significant changes in hematological parameters were seen in the Phase 1 study.  
In the Phase 1 study EIDD -2801- 1001, dose escalations were discontinued before a maximum 
tolerated dose was reached because plasma exposures that were expected to be efficacious based 
on scaling from animal models of seasonal and pandemic influenza were exceeded .   
 
The 200-mg dose is selected for Part 1 of 
this study. To allow for variability in PK  including intracellular  half-life of the  EIDD-1931- 5’-
triphosphate and to account for uncertainty in scaling assumptions, doses of up to [ADDRESS_1039121] opportunity to rigorously evaluate the safety, tolerability , and efficacy of EIDD -2801. No 
approved therapy is available to treat COVID-19 in outpatients. 
2.9. Justification for Age Restriction  
Children , adolescents, and adults under the age of 18 will not be included in this trial.  Initial 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_758947] 18 are 
able to be infected, the overwhelming burden of severe disease occurs among adults , particularly 
older adults.  Given the low incidence of disease in children, and in consideration that the P hase I 

Protocol EIDD-2801-2003  Version  5.0 
Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP   15 November 2020 
 
Confidential 28 data for EIDD -2801 are limited to adults, the risk/benefit analysis does not warrant inclusion of 
this population at this time. 
2.10. Justifi cation for Including Women of Childbearing Potential   
There is no safety data currently available in pregnant women or those who are breastfeeding.  
 
pregnant women or those who are nursing will not be eligible for 
this study. However, in the recently published study of remdesivir, which demonstrated a 
significant reduction in the duration of illness compared with placebo, the greatest recovery rate 
ratio occurred in individuals between the ages of [ADDRESS_1039122], there is a now a clear rational e for including women of child -bearing age into 
this Phase 2  study.  
Women of childbearing potential (as defined in Appendix 2) will therefore be eligible for 
enrollment only if they meet Inclusion Criterion  4.1.10, including the following:  
1. Have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test at Screening 
2. Agree to undergo a follow-up pregnancy test on Study Day [ADDRESS_1039123] missing or unevaluable primary or key 
secondary virology endpoint data , additional  participants  may be enrolled to ensure adequate data 
at each dose level. The total number of participants to be enrolled will not exceed 204.  
In Part 1  of this study, up to approximately  44 participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive 
EIDD- 2801 200 mg BID (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B ) orally BID for 5  days. Enrollment in Part 1 
may be interrupted to initiate enrollment in a different cohort, and may resume at a later time point.  
The study may continue to enroll the follow ing optional study parts : 
• In Part s 2--4, up to approximately16 participants per part will be randomized 3:1 into 
Arms C and D (Part 2), Arms E and F (Part 3) and Arms G and H (Part 4) to receive 
treatment as follows: EIDD -2801 up to 800 mg or placebo orally BID for 5 days.  
• In Parts  5--9, up to approximately 16 participants per part will be randomized 3:1 into 
Arms I and J (Part 5), Arms K and L (Part 6), Arms M and N (Part 7), Arms O and P (Part 8), and Arms Q and R (Part 9) to receive treatment as follows: EIDD -2801 up to 
800 mg or p lacebo orally BID for 5 days. 
The dose of EIDD -2801 evaluated in Part 1 will be 200 mg BID. The doses selected for subsequent 
study part s may be the same, higher or lower than the dose (s) studied in previous study part s, and 
will not exceed 800 mg BID.  Doses will be chosen based on emerging virology and safety data 
from this and other ongoing studies. Selected doses will be communicated in an official 
memo/protocol clarification letter. The maximum number of participants enrolled will be 204 .   
All study part sizes are approximate. Study parts may be combined for randomization purposes if 
the same dose is planned for more than one part.  Study parts enrolling at the same dose level may 
be enrolled simultaneously.

6.2.6. Clinical Assessments  
No physical exams will be conducted.  
Clinical investigators will perform a clinical assessment at enrollment including vital signs 
(temperature , blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and  oxygen saturation ). Height and 
weight should be recorded and may be obtained by [CONTACT_3445]’s self -report.  In their clinical 
judgement, they may identify some participants who are ill enough to warrant furt her clinical 
evaluation, which may result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. They will then refer these participants for such 
evaluation. These participants will not start study treatment and  will not be included in the 
analyses. While clinical judgement may not be standard across sites, the blinding process should 
balance site variation.

Confidential 49 7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND STUDY MONITORING  
7.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or diagnosis that occurs in a study participant during the conduct of the study REGARDLESS of the attribution (i.e., relationship of event to medical treatment/study 
product/device or procedure/intervention). This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or 
aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition. The principal investigator (PI ) 
and medical monitor will review all AEs on a weekly basis to determine which are treatment -
related AE s. 
7.2. Adverse Event Collection Requirements for This Protocol  
Post-entry, all AEs must be recorded on the eCRFs within [ADDRESS_1039154] been met:  
• All Grade ≥ 2 AEs  
• All AEs that led to a change in study treatment/intervention regardless of grade  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_758956] (PSS) of all SAEs, 
regardless of relationship to the investigational drug, within 24 hours of clinical site personnel becoming aware of the event. The PI (or designee) will provide the initial notification by [CONTACT_5583] 
a completed SAE form which must include the PI’s (or designee’s) assessment of the relationship 
of the event to investigational drug and must be signed by [CONTACT_978]. Follow -up information, or new 
information regarding  an ongoing SAE, must be provided promptly to Covance Drug Safety 
Services ( DSS) at [EMAIL_2654]  or via fax.  
The SAE Form will collect data surrounding the event (e .g., the nature of the symptom[s], ti me of 
onset in relation to initiation of therapy, duration, intensity, and whether or not therapy was 
interrupted or discontinued). The Investigator’s assessment of the probable cause of the event will 
also be included. In addition, relevant medical histor y, concomitant medications, laboratory and 
diagnostic tests reports, and procedures as well as all pertinent medical information related to the 
event will also be collected.  
All AEs that are reported must have their severity graded. To grade AEs, sites must refer to the 
DAIDS AE Grading Table, corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, which can be found on the DAIDS 
RSC website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical- research -sites/daids -adverse- event -grading-
tables . 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threateni ng illness 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] .  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
Protocol EIDD-2801-2003  Version  5.0

Confidential 50 • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect , or 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192109]). 
7.3. Reporting Requirements for this Study  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_758957], regardless of relationship to the investigational drug, within 24 hours of clinical site personnel becoming aware of the event. The PI (or designee) will provide the initial notification by [CONTACT_5583] a completed SAE form which 
must include the PI’s (or designee’s) assessment of the relationship of the event to investigational 
drug and must be signed by [CONTACT_978]. Follow -up information, or new information regarding an 
ongoing SAE, must be provided promptly to Covance DSS at  or via 
fax. The study agents for which expedited reporting are required are:  
• EIDD-2801 or Placebo for EIDD-2801 
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or 
other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) 
will be documented as the AE/SAE . 
Additionally, all reported pregnancies from the day of randomization through 50 days  (for female  
participants) or 100 days (for female partners of male participants) after the last dose of study  
intervention must be reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_093]. 
7.3.1. Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities present at the screening visit will be re corded as pre -treatment signs and 
symptoms. After study treatment administration, a clinical laboratory abnormality should be 
reported as an AE only if it is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093].  
In addition, the following laboratory abnormalities should also be captured on the AE CRF page 
as appropriate: 
• Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
• Any laboratory abnormality that required the participant to have the investigational product discontinued or interrupted 
• Any laboratory abnormality that required the participant to receive specific corrective 
therapy 
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical  diagnosis would be used by [CONTACT_80582] (e .g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
7.3.2. Grading Severity of Events  
The DAIDS AE Grading Table, corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, must be used and is available 
on the DAIDS RSC website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical- research -sites/daids -adverse-
event- grading -tables.

Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP   15 November 2020  
 
Confidential  51 When changes in severity of an AE occur, the maximum severity for the experience should be 
noted.   
7.3.3. Relationship  
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed by [CONTACT_38237]: 
• No (unrelated, not related, no relation): The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and 
another cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is suspected . 
• Yes (related): The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence 
or worsening of the AE is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified.  
The follo wing factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration -  The event should occur after the 
study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the eve nt. 
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - Each report should be evaluated in the 
context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the participant may have. 
• Concomitant medication -  The other medication s the participant is taking or the treatment 
the participant receives should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug -  Clinical and/or preclinical data may 
indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses -  The exposure to stress might induce adverse 
changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study drug - The known pharmacologic 
properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should 
be considered. 
7.3.4. Expedited AE Reporting Period 
• Any medical condition that is present at  the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered  as baseline and not reported as an AE.  However, if  any pre-existing medical  
condition increases  in severity  after starting study treatment, it should be recorded as  an 
AE. 
• Although disease progression including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53763] -[ADDRESS_1039155] pregnancy information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy in a female 
participant or female partner of male participant (after obtaining the necessary signed informed 
consent from the female partner).  
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any 
pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneously reported to the 
investigator or their designee), including the pregnancy of a male participant’s female partner, that 
occurs during the study are reportable to the Sponsor as described in Section 7.3. 
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy.  
Any pregnancy complication will be reported as an AE or SAE. The medical reason (example: maternal health or fetal disease) for an elective termination of a 
pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. Prenatal testing showing a fetus will be born with 
severe abnormalities/congenital anomalies that lead s to an electi ve termination of a pregnancy will 
be reported as an SAE for the fetus.  
Pregnancy outcomes of ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign 
hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth mu st 
be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the 
outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.  
7.4. Study Monitoring  
7.4.1. Adverse Events  
The UNC Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review and assess select e xpedited adverse 
events ( EAE ) reports for potential impact on the study participant safety and protocol conduct as 
per, guidance documents, and standard operating procedures  (SOPs ) as applicable. Summary 
reports of AEs will be shared weekly with the medica l monitor(s). SAEs will be reported through 
the Covance SAE reporting protocol within 24 hours to the medical monitor(s). The EIDD -[ADDRESS_1039156] of the study via regular summaries of screening, 
accrual, study and study treatment discontinuation, and data and specimen completeness. The UNC SMC  will monitor safety regularly .

10.4. Randomization and Stratification  
In Part 1 of the study, e ligible participants will be randomized using a 1:1 ratio to Arm A or B  using 
permuted blocks. In all subsequent study parts, eligible participants will be randomized using a 
3:1 ratio ( EIDD -2801:placebo) to Arm C or D  (Part 2), Arm E or F (Part 3), Arm G or H (Part 4) , 
Arm I or J (Part 5), Arm K  or L (Part 6), Arm M or N  (Part 7), Arm O or P  (Part 8 ), or Arm Q or 
R (Part 9).   
In Part 1, r andomization  will be stratified  by “early” versus “late” time from symptom onset, where 
“early” time from symptom onset is defined by [CONTACT_294819]  (i.e., randomization date and time)  0 to 
≤60 hours from symptom onset and “late” is enrollment  (i.e., randomization date and time)  >60 to 
≤168 hours from symptom onset.  In subsequent study parts , randomization will not be stratified  
due to lack of availability of subjects in the “early” time from symptom onset.  
Protocol EIDD-2801-[ADDRESS_1039161] 
(confirmed) dose of study treatment (approximately 22 each in Arms A and B).   
In subsequent, optional study parts , the sample size for each part  will include approximately 
[ADDRESS_1039162] (confirmed) dose of study treatment (approximately 
12 participants randomized to an active EIDD -2801 arm and 4 randomized to placebo). 
Participants who are randomized but do not take the first (confirmed) dose of study treatment will not be followed and will be replaced.  
This study i s designed to evaluate the antiviral activity of EIDD -2801 by [CONTACT_758997] (days) 
until elimination of viral RNA detection  in NP  swabs in people who receive EIDD -[ADDRESS_1039163] (for Part 1) and median time (days) until first non- detectable SARS -
Cov-2 NP  swabs will be estimated in each trial arm.  
Power/ Sample Siz e for Part 1: 
The distribution of days until SARS -CoV- 2 viral RNA  is not detectable  (i.e., below the limit of 
quantification in NP swabs ) can be compared between the 2 trial arms (drug vs placebo) using an 
exact log -rank test. At a 0.10 type I error probability and unde r the assumptions in  Figure 8 and 
the corresponding table below, there is > 85% power to detect a difference (Drug - Placebo) of at 
least 30% if the eval uable sample size is 19 individuals per arm.   
Anticipating up to 10% missing data, enrolling n=44 participants total (approximately 22 per arm) 
in Part 1  will provide 88 % power for the primary endpoint.  Power was calculated empi[INVESTIGATOR_758960] 
R version 3.6.2 using 5000 simulated datasets. 
•The power to detect a risk difference (RD) (Drug - Placebo)  of -30% is 0.88.
•The power to detect a RD (Drug - Placebo)  of -40% is 0.98.
•The power to detect a RD (Drug - Placebo)  of -50% is >0.99
The table below contains the assumed data for the viral RNA detection  simulation s. This a ssumes 
collection of NP  swabs from all enrolled individuals on Study Days 1 , 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28.

Participants who receive placebo will be pooled in the  final analyses.  The between group 
comparisons assessment of dose and exposure response will be evaluated based on endpoints of 
time to undetectable SARS -CoV- 2 viral RNA and change in viral RNA over time (including 
viral RNA baseline -normalized AUC through Day 28), and number (%) of subjects with 1, 2 or 
≥3 log 10 viral RNA decline over time.  
10.6. Populations for Analyses  
Statistical analyses will be performed on the following populations:  
• Modified Intent -to-Treat ( mITT) : All subjects who are randomized into th e study  and 
have baseline and at  least [ADDRESS_1039165] baseline viral RNA assessment. Subjects will be analyzed 
according to the treatment  they actually received.  
• Safety:  All subjects who are randomized and take at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects 
will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  
• PK: Subjects in the safety population with at least 1 PK concentration value. 
• Per Protocol (PP): Subjects in the safety population who had no major protocol deviations  
and completed the Day 28 follow -up Visit.  
10.7. Statistical Analyses  
The efficacy, PK, and safety variables and associated analyses are described in this section. 
Additional details will be described in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) that will be prepared a nd 
finalized before database lock. Should the analyses specified in the SAP differ from those 
described in the protocol, the methodology in the SAP will prevail.  General methodology will 
include descriptive tabular and/or graphical summarizations by [CONTACT_266476] . 
Continuous variables will be presented using descriptive statistics: number of observations (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical values will be 
summarized with counts and percentages. All coll ected data will be presented in listings.  
10.7.1. Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive statistical methods will be used to tabulate and summarize demographics and baseline 
characteristics.

Plasma concentrations of EIDD -2801 and EIDD- 1931 will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_758998]. A PK- pharmacodynamic ( PD) model will also be developed to examine 
the relation ship between EIDD- 2801/EIDD -1931 PK, viral load reduction,  and clinical outcomes . 
Details of PK and PK -PD analys es will be provided in the SAP.

Confidential 62 10.7.3. Part 1 Analyses 
Part 1 will be analyzed separately as an a priori  powered study. A Statistical Analysis Plan wi ll be 
developed that describes  the analyses to address the study’s primary , secondary, and exploratory  
objectives.  
The following provides an outline of the methods for the main comparisons between randomized 
arms, particularly for the primary outcome measu re.   
Analyses involving randomized comparisons will include all randomized participants who received the first ( confirmed ) dose of study treatment, according to a  modified intention- to-treat 
(m-ITT) approach. Participants who do not receive the first (confirmed) dose will be replaced. 
Unless stated otherwise, the date of randomization will be the time origin for analysis (Day 1). Additional per -protocol analyses may be performed, particularly for virology efficacy endpoints. 
Missing data are expected to be uncommon (<5 to 10% of participants). Losses to follow -up will 
be assumed non- informative and complete -case analyses will be conducted.  
This is a virology proof -of-principle study, as such a type I error probability of 10% (α=0.10) will 
be used throughout, with no planned adjustments for multiplicity or primary or secondary 
endpoints. Throughout, all statistical tests will be two -sided and “exact” statistical procedures that 
do not rely on large sample assumptions will be applied  where computationally feas ible.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Outcome Measures  
Virologic Efficacy : The distribution of days until first non- detectable SARS -CoV-2 viral RNA  in 
NP swabs will be estimated for each randomized arm (drug versus placebo), using Kaplan -Meier 
methods with a corresponding exact stratified log -rank test (Part 1 only: to account for the “early” 
versus “late” time from symptom onset randomization strata). “N on detec table” will be  defined as 
a viral load below the limit of quantification  (BLOQ) . Two consecutive non -detectable viral RNAs 
in NP swabs (or one negative with no further follow -up) will be required to achieve the event. The 
date of the first non -detectable w ill be the event date. Participants who prematurely discontinue 
the study before achieving non- detectable results will have follow -up for efficacy endpoints 
censored at the date of last measurement.  Losses to follow -up will be assumed  non- informative.  
Safety and Tolerability : In order to measure the safety and tolerability of EIDD -2801, we will 
estimate by [CONTACT_758999] 1) any AEs leading to early discontinuation of blinded treatment (active or placebo), 2) study drug- related disconti nuation of treatment, 3) new 
grade 3 or higher AE (not already present at baseline), and 4) study drug-related new grade 3 or 
higher AE. The cumulative probability (i.e., risk) of each safety and each tolerability endpoint 
(4 endpoints) will be estimated u sing the Kaplan -Meier approach and  stratified log -rank test will 
be employed for between trial arm comparisons (as outlined for the primary efficacy outcome). 
Follow-up will be right censored at the date of last known status and event times will be the dat e 
of first onset of the given endpoint (e.g., time to first AE leading to early discontinuation of 
blinded treatment).  
The safety and tolerability profile of EIDD -2801 in humans is currently not fully characterized  
and descriptive participant- level listings of safety and tolerability events will be summarized. We 
will estimate 28 -day risk function of each safety and tolerability endpoint with a corresponding 
2-sided 90% confidence interval, with focus on the upper co nfidence limit for interpretation of 
results. To inform the design of future larger trials we will estimate the difference in probabilities

other  studies, a lthough  a risk difference is of  greater public he alth relevance.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary O utcomes 
Safety: Occurrence of Grade 2 or higher AEs and drug related AEs will be evaluated using the 
same approach as outlined for the p rimary safety analysis in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. We will 
describe and estimate all-cause mor tality and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48285] 28-day period from an d 
including the day of the first (confirmed) dose of  study treatment. The Kaplan-M eier approach  
described above will be applied to the endpoint of days until first hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059], and 
the 28-day risk function will be estimated as described fo r the primary safety endpoints. 
Duration of fever, duration of symptoms , and duration of time to self -reported return to usual 
health will be summarized with descriptive statistics. Participant -specific durations of fever and 
symptoms will be compared between study arms using a stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The

headache , sore throat, loss of sense of smell, loss of  sense of taste, cough, and difficulty breathing. 
Improvement in these symptoms is defined as a decrease in all new or worsened symptoms  (i.e., 
from severe/moderate severity to mild/absent/pre -COVID- 19 severit y, or a decrease in mild 
severity to absent). Participants who do not have complete  symptom diaries  due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_758963].

Safety and efficacy data will be provided both based on the pooled analyses , as well as per cohort 
analyses.  For the pooled analyses, data across all study parts will be combined.  Subjects that

group.  All  analyses will be performed based on the safety population ( defin ed as subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of randomized study drug as treated ) by [CONTACT_7169].  Data from the active 
treatment arms  (e.g., Arms A, C, E, G, I , K, M, O, and Q) may be combined for analysis , when 
appropriate, in comparison with the pooled placebo group. No formal hypothesis tests will be

statistics using a 2- sample binomial test or Fisher’s exact test.   
Continuous endpoint s (actual, change from baseline, percent change from baseline, adjusted AUC 
on treatment or during study) will be summarized over time by [CONTACT_1570].  The between -
group differences and associated 95% confidence interval s will be estimated using an ANCOVA 
model, where dose group will be included as a fixed effect  and baseline and days since infection

Safety  
All safety d ata will be provided descriptively by [CONTACT_759003].  Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). An AE is considered treatment -emergent if it begins or worse ns in severity 
after the first dose of randomized study drug. The number and percentage of subjects with treatment- emergent AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term.

Laboratory abnormalities will be graded 
according to the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events 
Corrected Version 2.1, if applicable.  Any graded abnormality that occurs following the initiation of 
study drug and represents at least a 1- grade increase from the baseline assessment is defined as

10.9. Interim  Analysis  
No formal interim analysis is planned.  
An interim virology data monitoring report may be prepared after approximately the tenth  
participant in selected  study part s (Parts 1 to 9 ) have data available through study Day 7. Blinded 
data listings and pooled descriptive interim summaries of viral RNA and infectious virus may be 
reviewed to verify assumptions made for sizing this proof -of-concept study, to determine whether 
Protocol EIDD-2801-[ADDRESS_1039168] been enrolled. Site personnel will remain blinded until the database is locked at the end of 
the study. These data may be shared with the IND sponsor. 
After completion of each  study part, unblinded virology data and safety data may be reviewed to 
determine the dose(s) for the subsequent parts.  
10.10.  Unblinding 
For unblinding requests, including emergency unblinding, refer to  
, or other similar site -specific standard operating 
procedure.  
In the event that emergency disclosure of treatment assignment is thought to be required, the site 
investigator must follow , or other similar site -specific 
standard operating procedure. 
Unblinding
 will not occur to allow replacement of participants (see Section 6.2.4).  
In cas
e of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding 
of a participants’ study drug assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_1152] a participant’s study drug assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the participant. 
If a participant’s study drug assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within [ADDRESS_1039169] the accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly 
affect a participant's rights, safety, or well- being (ICH  E3). The site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_758964]. Once important 
protocol deviations are identified, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_90478]. Protocol  deviations must be sent to the IRB/EC per their guidelines.  
For this study , all protocol deviations that meet the definition of important as defined in the MOPS

Confidential  76 16.2. Appendix 2:  Contraceptive Guidance  
Definition of Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below):  
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:  
• Prem enarchal  
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Mulle rian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interv iew. 
• Postmenopausal female  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.  
o A high follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may 
be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ).  However, in the absence 
of [ADDRESS_1039174] dis continue HRT to allow confirmation of 
postmenopausal status before study enrollment.

Confidential 77 Contraception Requirements  
CONTRACEPTIVES ALLOWED DURING THE STUDY INCLUDEa: 
Highly Effective Methods That Have Low User Dependency  
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
•Progesterone -only subdermal contraceptive implantb
•Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)c
•N
on-hormonal intrauterine device ( IUD)
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Azoospermic partner (vasectomized or secondary to a medical cause)
This is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of th e
W
OCBP  and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional hig hly effective method of
contraception should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.
Note: documentation of azoospermia for a male participant can come from the site personnel’s review of th e
participant’s medical records, medical examinat ion, or medical history interview.
Sexual Abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in rel ation to the duration of the study and the preferred and lifestyle of the 
participant.  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependentd (must be used in combination with a 
barrier method)  
Combined (estrogen- and progestogen- containing ) hormonal contraception  
− Oral 
− Intravaginal  
− Transdermal  
− Injectable  
Progestogen -only hormone c ontraceptionb 
− Oral 
− Injectable  
Barrier methods to be used with hormonal contraceptives above (male condoms are preferred method)  
•Male or female condom with or without spermicide
•Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide
•A combination of male condom with either cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double
barrier methods)  
Footnotes: 
a)Contraceptive use by [CONTACT_759007].
b)If locally required, in accordance with CTFG guidelines, acceptable contraceptive implants are limited to those which
inhibit ovulation.
c)IUS is a progestin-releasing IUD
d)Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly  (and not in combination with barrier method). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_758970]-use failure rates (i .e., when used consistently and correctly).
Note : The following are not acceptable methods of contraception alone or in combination:  
− Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides 
only, and lactational amenorrhea method. 
− Male and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction).

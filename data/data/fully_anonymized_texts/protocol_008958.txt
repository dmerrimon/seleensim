 OBJECTIVES  
 The purpose of the study is to determine if opi[INVESTIGATOR_79516].  
 We hypothesize that patients are frequently prescribed more opi[INVESTIGATOR_79517], result ing in excess medications that are at risk for misuse, diversion and 
contribution to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_79518].  
 
BACKGROUND  
Perioperative pain management is an important aspect of quality patient care. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_79519], with the [LOCATION_002] writing over 
250 million prescriptions for painkillers per year[1]. Increased usage has led to unintended 
negative consequences for individuals and society. It is estimated that 46 people die each day 
from an overdose of pr escription painkillers, and individual use can lead to the development of 
tolerance and worse treatment outcomes [1, 2]. Further issues arise when opi[INVESTIGATOR_79520], 
it is estimated that nontherapeutic use has increased three fold in recent years[3]. In the United 
States alone in [ADDRESS_86834] of opi[INVESTIGATOR_79521] $53.4 billion, of 
which $[ADDRESS_86835] productivity, $8.[ADDRESS_86836] and the 
remainder drug abuse treatment and medical com plications[4]. The federal government has 
recognized this epi[INVESTIGATOR_79522] a call for clinicians to more responsibly prescribe opi[INVESTIGATOR_79523][5].  
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_79524], from 2000 -2010 the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_79525] 11.3% to 19.6% whereas there was no change in the prescribing of 
non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_79526]. Further, when specifically looking at new musculoskeletal pain 
visits, one half resulted in pharmacologic treatment, with the prescribing o f non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_79527] 38% to 29% from 2000 to 2010, respectively[6]. The 
clinical use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_79528] -operative pain control has also been linked to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_79529][7]. Legitimate opi[INVESTIGATOR_79530] a 33% increased risk of future misuse after high school[8].  
 
It has been estimated that orthopedic surgeons prescribe 7.7% of all opi[INVESTIGATOR_79531][9].Special attention needs to be paid to the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_79532], there is considerable 
variability among surgeon and procedure in regards to the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_79533][10].An analysis of 250 patients undergoing 
outpatient upper extremity surgery found that on average patients consumed 10 opi[INVESTIGATOR_79534], 
with 19 pi[INVESTIGATOR_79535] a total of 4,639 pi[INVESTIGATOR_79536][10]. Leftover 
prescription o pi[INVESTIGATOR_79537][11]. 
Further studies are needed to quantify the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_79538], misuse, diversion and contribution to the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817].  
 
STUDY ENDPOINTS:  
This study is observational in nature. The study will end once we have collected data for 60 
patients for each arm.  
 
STUDY INTERVENTION(S)/INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT(S):  
N/A 
 
PROCEDURES INVOLVED:  
This study will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_79539] -inferiority in opi[INVESTIGATOR_79540].  
 
Eligible patients will be identified in clinic by [CONTACT_79549]. Patients will 
subsequently be approached by [CONTACT_79550]. In the event that a patient 
 
Hip Arthroscopy RCT study  
Page 4 of 8 Version Date: 06/03/2019   
 determines that they wish to pursue surgery and this is discussed by [CONTACT_79551].  
 
All patients will fill out a preoperative questionnaire  asking them the questions below related to 
specific risk factors for opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834]/abuse in addition to the iHOT -12, the NPRS,  and the PCS . 
 
 Age 
 Sex 
 BMI 
 Do you actively smoke  cigarettes?  
 If no, have you ever consistently smoked cigarettes (daily for > 1  mont h)? 
 What is your employment  status?  
 Is this injury part of a workers’ compensation  claim?  
 Are you actively participating in organized sporting activities? If so, at what level (ie 
professional, college,  recreational)  
 Are you currently using narcotic pain  medications?  
 Do you have a personal hx of substance abuse (ex. prescription or illicit drugs, 
alcohol)?  
 Do you have a family history of substance abuse (ex. prescription or illicit drugs, 
alcohol)?  
 What is the highest level of education you  attained?  
 What i s your average yearly household  income?  
 
The patients undergoing hip arthroscopy will be randomized into two groups prior to surgery by 
[CONTACT_16133]. The surgeons’ physician assistants will be responsible for prescribing the 
appropriate medications.  
 
 Group 1: Will be prescribed [ADDRESS_86837] - operative 
pain medication  regimens.  
 Group 2: Will be prescribed [ADDRESS_86838] - operative 
pain medication  regimens.  
 
In order to limit potential variability in sample size, block randomization will be utilized with the 
following parameters: 12 blocks with 5 patients in each block. The blocks will be as follows:  
 
Block 1/7/13  
[ZIP_CODE]  
 
Block 2/8/14  
[ZIP_CODE]  
 
Block 3/9/15  
[ZIP_CODE]  
 
Block 4/10/16  
[ZIP_CODE] 
 
Block 5/11/17  
[ZIP_CODE]  
 
Block 6/12/[ADDRESS_86839] study  
Page 5 of 8 Version Date: 06/03/2019   
 be enrolled in the order listed in the block. For example, if block 6 is selected initially Patient 1 
will be enrolled in Group 2, Patient 2 will be enrolled in group 2, Patient 3 will be enrolled in 
group 1, etc. After every 5th patient is randomized to a group a new block will be randomly 
selected.  
 
The surgeons’ physician assistants will be responsible for pres cribing the appropriate 
medications. To clarify, we do not electronically prescribe C2 medications as a routine part of 
practice and do not intend to as part of the study.  
 
All patients will be provided the same counseling regardless of the amount of narco tics they are 
prescribed. In the event that a patient requires additional narcotics on top of the original 
prescription the treating surgeon will need to be notified in order to accurately assess the 
amount already consumed and appropriately prescribe addi tional medications.  
 
Please note that there is considerable variability in opi[INVESTIGATOR_79541]. 
Patient's that undergo hip arthroscopy typi[INVESTIGATOR_79542] [ADDRESS_86840] that the majority of pa tients prescribed 60 tablets do not take greater than 50% of what 
they are prescribed. We are interested in determining the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_79543].  
 
Following their o peration, all patients will have Pain -Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) 
assessed at [ADDRESS_86841] -anesthesia care unit (PACU).  
 
Additionally, a phone ca ll will be placed at 24 hours, 48 hours and between 7 -14 days after 
surgery and asked a Numeric Pain Rating Score (NPRS), how many opi[INVESTIGATOR_79544], how many are left over and when the date they stopped taking them.  
 
NPRS scores can be per formed verbally. The following statement will be provided to patients:  
 
The 11 -point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. “no pain”) to 
'10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. “pain as bad as you can imagine” or “worst p ain 
imaginable”), please rate your pain on a scale of 0 -10. 
 
If they are still taking pain medications at that point, an additional follow -up call will be placed at 
21 days (+1 -3 days) after surgery asking the same questions. We will allow 4 total phone ca lls 
(24 hours, 48 hours, 7 -14 days, and 21 (+ 1 to 3) days post -surgery. If patients continue to take 
narcotics 21 days after surgery they will be listed as >3 weeks of narcotic use)  
 
Refill requests will also be recorded.  
Maximum total length of the study  will be [ADDRESS_86842] -surgery.

STUDY TIMELINES  
This study will be observational in nature. Patients will fill out a preoperative questionnaire

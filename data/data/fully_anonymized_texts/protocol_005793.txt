Confidential Page [ADDRESS_965432] approximately 15% of the global population and up to 30% of the U. S. 
population (Bielory 2000). Allergic reactions can vary from a mild, self-limiting 
condition to a debilitating condition that significantly impairs the quality of life. Allergic 
conjunctivitis is generally considered a type [ADDRESS_965433] cell degranulation and release of histamine and a late 
phase involving various pro-inflammatory mediators (Abelson 2003). Histamine is the 
primary preformed mediator responsible for the typi[INVESTIGATOR_710025], vasodilation, and vascular leakage leading to ocular redness, chemosis, and 
blepharitis. The early phase response occurs within minutes to hours following allergen 
exposure. The itching associated with the early phase allergic reaction has been shown to 
peak at ~ 5-[ADDRESS_965434] cells also synthesize and release cytokines, chemokines, and growth 
factors that initiate a cascade of inflammatory events leading to a late-phase reaction 
involving a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, 
cytokines, and interleukins and characterized by [CONTACT_704402], neutrophils, 
and subsequent lymphocytes and macrophages into the conjunctival tissues (Ciprandi 
1993; Bacon 2000). 
 
Current treatments for allergic conjunctivitis include histamine blockers and mast-cell 
stabilizers, which address early-phase symptoms, and steroids, which address late-phase 
symptoms. Agents that have good efficacy with fewer adverse effects, particularly 
associated with steroids for late-phase symptoms,  are warranted.  
 
Amnion-derived Multipotent Progenitor (AMP) cells have a unique secretory profile, 
producing a novel secretome containing many cytokines and growth factors known to be 
involved in wound healing and the inflammatory response. This secretome, known as 
ST266 (formerly Amnion-derived Cellular Cytokine Solution [ACCS], Noveome 
Biotherapeutics, Inc.), has been carefully characterized. Noveome produces ST266 under 
cGMP conditions. Placentas are tested and screened for known infectious agents, and 
conform to all HIPAA requirements. The secreted proteins have been characterized by 
[CONTACT_143046], antibody array analysis,  and ELISA. Lot release testing of individual 
production lots of ST266 have documented the concentration reproducibility of fiv e 
selected cytokines (PDGF- ββ, VEGF, Angiogenin, TIMP -1, TIMP-2) and MMP-9 
inhibition activity. ST266 may provide a novel treatment option for inflammatory 
conditions, including allergic conjunctivitis (Steed 2008 ). 
 
ST266 has been shown to be anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective in 
several animal models, including rats, rabbits, guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], and mice. ST266 appears to 
reinstate physiologic homeostasis in impaired inflammatory conditions without the 
application of steroids and associated side effects. The scientific rationale for using this 
amnion cell-derived product originated from scarless fetal wound healing partially

Confidential Page 16 of 81 attributed to cytokines in the amniotic fluid (Larson 2010, Lo 2012). Several in vivo  
animal studies showed faster wound healing with ST266, sometimes with less 
inflammation. In a mouse ear model of inflammation caused by a contact [CONTACT_710035], ST266 
reduced inflammation similar to clobetasol, a class I steroid, by [CONTACT_710036]. Nonclinical 
toxicology studies have been performed with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (dermal, oral cavity, eyes) and 
systemic (IV) formulations of ST266, and no safety issues have been identified. When 
given topi[INVESTIGATOR_710026], there was no evidence of systemic exposure to ST266 
(Bergmann 2009).  
 
ST266 has been shown to be safe in eight separate preclinical GLP safety studies of 
single and multiple repeat-dose administrations for topi[INVESTIGATOR_14929]. A 24-hour ocular 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) and tissue distribution study conducted in 36 New Zealand white 
rabbits following topi[INVESTIGATOR_710027]266 (50 µL) found ST266 primarily 
in the lower conjunctiva, with no indication that the protein diffused in the vitreous or 
retina after topi[INVESTIGATOR_567537]. Peak tissue concentrations were observed at [ADDRESS_965435]-dosing, approximately 70% of the material remained in the 
vitreous, suggesting extended activity. In an acute eye irritation study with three (3 ) New 
Zealand white rabbits, topi[INVESTIGATOR_710028]266 (0.1 mL) after 72 hours indicated 
that the drug was non-irritating (Investigational Brochure ST266 , topi[INVESTIGATOR_710029] 2016).  
 
ST266 has been studied in Phase [ADDRESS_965436] been exposed to ST266 for up to 42 
consecutive days without drug-related adverse effects in six (6) separate clinical trials. 
One (1) study showed anti-inflammatory efficacy in treating gingivitis. Another Phase 1 
study with topi[INVESTIGATOR_710030]266 treatment in subjects with partial thickness burns indicated no 
evidence of systemic absorption of ST266 components. Noveome is currently conducting 
a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled 9-month safety and efficacy 
study of up to 150 subjects with periodontitis. Noveome completed a Phase 1 study (ST-
05-14) to assess the safety of ST266 eye drops in subjects with moderate to severe dry 
ey
e. Thirty (30) subjects were randomized to receive either study drug or an over-the-
counter artificial tear eye drops four times per day for six (6) weeks. Subjects were 
examined regularly during the six-week dosing period and then followed for an additional 
month for safety. No adverse events were observed related to administration of the study 
drug. No clinically significant changes were observed in best corrected visual acuity 
(BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), endothelial cell density (EDC), conjunctival 
staining, tear osmolarity, cup- to-disc ratio, hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, or 
vital signs after initiation of the investigational treatment. The results provide preliminary 
evidence of safety and tolerability of ST266 eye drops in human subjects.(Investigational 
Brochure ST266 topi[INVESTIGATOR_710031] 2016).   
The conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC)-induced allergic response mimics the acute 
response that is triggered by [CONTACT_710037]. The Ora-CAC® model has 
been used to evaluate anti-allergic agents and to identify the cellular and mediator 
responses seen in allergic conjunctivitis (Abelson et al 1990). The Ora-CAC® model has

be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP, without any judgment about 
causality. An AE  can arise from any use of the IP (eg, off-label use, use in combination 
with another drug or medical device) and from any route of administration, formulation, 
or dose, including an overdose.  
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate 
pages of the eCRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in clinical finding is considered 
an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one (1) comprehensive event. Any pre-existing 
medical condition that worsens after administration of study medication will also be 
considered an  adverse event. Study medication includes the drug under evaluation or any 
other medications required by [CONTACT_590217]. 
Ocular complaints should not be addressed as AEs unless the complaint is outside the 
normal limits for allergic conjunctivitis symptoms after allergen exposure or is associated 
with clinical sequelae (i.e., adverse slit lamp examination finding). 
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relationship to IP, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078]. 
 Severity 11.1.1
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423].  The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the 
event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
 Mild :  Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activi ties. 
ST266 Ophthalmic Drops Noveome Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol: ST266- AC-201/16-100-0005  Amendment V3.0/13Jan2017 
 
Confidential Page 45 of 81  Moderate :  Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Severe :  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, 
and interferes with the subject’s d aily activities. 
 Relationship to Investigational Product 11.1.2
The relationship of each AE to the IP should be determined by [CONTACT_710042]: 
 Suspected :  A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. A suspected AE 
can be further defined as:  
 
 Definite:   Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from 
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug 
class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_597728]. 
 
 Probable:   Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from 
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug 
class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_710033]. 
 
 Possible:   Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from 
the time of administration, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s 
clinical state or by [CONTACT_339413]. 
 
 Not Suspected :  A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE. A 
not suspected AE can further be defined as: 
 
 N
ot Related:   Concurrent illness, concurrent medication, or other known cause 
is clearly responsible for the AE, the administration of the IP and the occurrence 
of the AE are not reasonably related in time, OR exposure to IP has not 
occurred. 
Types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the AE 
include:  a single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated with IP exposure (eg, angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with IP 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the IP (eg, tendon 
rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as 
known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other 
events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the IP-treatment group than in a 
concurrent or historical control group.

Confidential Page 46 of 81  Expectedness 11.1.3
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations: 
 Unexpected :  an AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or Report of 
Prior Investigations (ROPI) or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed. 
 Expected :  an AE that is listed in the IB or ROPI [INVESTIGATOR_253675]. 
 Not applicable:  an AE unrelated to the IP. 
The Investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final 
classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination.  
 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS 11.2
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if less 
than 24 hours).  For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission includes 
transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit.  Inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]:  emergency room visits; outpatient/same-
day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units. 
Note:  The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers t o any extension 
of an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_710034]. 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;

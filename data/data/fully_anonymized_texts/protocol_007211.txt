 Proposal Summary  
Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473511]:  A Safety Assessment, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_473505]-Discharge Bleeding  
 
CHAMP Study: Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473512]  
• High bleeding risk is common (30%) among patients undergoing PCI at Mayo Clinic, [COMPANY_002]ster.  
• Most bleeds occur within 30 days of PCI.  
• Current studies analyzing shortened DAPT regimens exclude the crucial first 30 days.  
 
What This Study Adds  
• Genotype -based stratification of patients  receiving antiplatelet therapy after PCI.  
• Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473513].  
• Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473514].  
• First study to evaluate antiplatelet monotherapy within [ADDRESS_606759]-discharge b leeding  (PDB)  with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)  in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions 
(PCI)  is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.1-[ADDRESS_606760] incidence occurring within 30 days of discharge. Patients with PDB  are also at increased risk for 
subsequent death or myocardial infarction (MI) , with the highest risk occurring within the first [ADDRESS_606761],  reduction in PDB has 
been demonstrated following early  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_473515] . The Ticagrelor with or without Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_473516] -Risk Patients after PCI (TWILIGHT) trial demonstrated a doubling of major bleeding risk in patients randomized to ticagrelor 
with a spi[INVESTIGATOR_473517].8 More recently, 
two randomized trials demonstrated the safety of P2Y12 monotherapy (mainly clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]) following one and three months of DAPT  
in low -risk patients receiving drug -eluting stents  (DES) .9, 10 Similarly, Acetyl Salicylic Elimination Trial (ASET) confirmed the safety 
of prasugrel monotherapy following DES  in stable coronary artery disease.11 These studies excluded patients with high bleeding risk 
(HBR), however, the results  were consistent in demonstrating reduction in PDB  without any increase in the ischemic events.  The 
MASTER DAPT trial demonstrated noninferiority of [ADDRESS_606762] DAPT for 2 or more 
months in terms of net adverse events  and major cardiac/cerebral ischemic events. There was also a lower rate of major or clinically 
significant minor bleeds in the group receiving only a month of DAPT.12 
 
Approximately 15% patients  undergoing PCI  have HBR  and are generally excluded or underrepresented  in the  DES  trials.13, 14 These 
patients will benefit from shorter duration of DAPT . However , contemporary clinical trials are done with newer  stent designs  
(polymer -free)[ADDRESS_606763] 
80% risk reduction for ischemic events with genotype guidance in the first [ADDRESS_606764] risk period follow ing PCI.  
Potential advantages of genotype -guided P2Y 12 inhibitor therapy in which a large number of patients receive clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (given an 
approximate 50% to 70% prevalence of CYP2C19  noncarriers) and the remainder receive more potent alternative P2Y [ADDRESS_606765] and  lower risk for bleeding for this group  as compared with patients receiving either ticagrelor or prasugrel. Furthermore, 
reduction in ischemic events with newer P2Y12 inhibitors could only be demonstrated among CYP2C19 loss -of-function  (LOF)  
carriers, underscoring the utility of upfro nt genetic testing prior to routine DAPT prescription in patients with HBR undergoing PCI.  
Our specific aims of th e present  pi[INVESTIGATOR_473518]: 
Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473519] 100 consecutive patients 
with HBR and meeting the inclusion criteria  ([ADDRESS_606766] been enrolled then withdrawn for 
various reasons such as starting an additional blood thinner, patient preference, etc.) . To ensure that we have data on 100 active 
patients that complete their 1 month visit, we will plan to accrue up to 1 50 patients. The primary safety end point will be showing 
noninferiority of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473520]2C19 LOF allele  
(QuantStudio with Chemagic DNA extraction) . All patients will receive clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (600  mg load &  75 mg maintenance) and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
(324 mg load & 81  mg maintenance) for the first week . Those wit h CYP2C19  *2 or  *3  LOF allele ( CYP2C19   LOF carriers)] will be  
prescribed prasugrel or ticagrelor  [prasugrel 60 mg  load, maintenance 10 mg  or 5 mg (for patients ≥ 75 years or < 60 kg) daily or 
ticagrelor 180 mg  load, maintenance 90 mg twice  daily  (dose escalation with bolus will occur regardless of the timing of the last 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473521])] . Non-carriers (or those with inconclusive results) will continue with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]  75 mg daily maintenance dose.  
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_473522]2C19  results are available . 
Specific Aim 2: Among participants enrolled in aim 1, aim [ADDRESS_606767]-dismissal all-cause death, any  MI up to 180 days, repeat revascularization, or any other BARC bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].   
 
SIGNIFICANCE  
Reduction in PDB following PCI is a Major Unmet Need : PDB is common and is seen in approximately 5% ; and 20% of those bleeds 
manifest in the first month following PCI. The increase in complexity of patients undergoing PCI and the concerns for late stent 
thrombosis led to prolongation of duration of DAPT following PCI. Coincidentally, patients with HBR were excluded, 
underrepresented, or were given bare metal stents. Recent trials have demonstrated superiority of DES over bare metal stents  in 
patients with HBR and showed safety and efficacy of one -month DAPT. The duration of DAPT for at least [ADDRESS_606768] heightene d ischemic risk, especially among patients presenting with acute 
 
4 
 coronary syndrome. The challenges in defining the optimal management of HBR patients undergoing PCI include  heterogeneity in its 
definition and  paucity of relevant clinical data .  
Proposed Strategy  to Reduce PDB through Genotype -Guided Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473523] : Reduction in the ischemic risk with current 
generation of DES, modulation of atherothrombotic risk with guideline -directed therapy and shift in patient case -mix towards greater 
noncardiac morbidity and mortality have identified strategies to lower bleeding without compromising anti -ischemic efficacy. In that 
regard,  trials  have shown superiority and safety of DES over bare metal stents with [ADDRESS_606769] PDB occur s early and 
underscores the need to abbreviate  further  the duration of DAPT. More recently, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -free prasugrel therapy following successful 
stenting in patients with stable coronary artery disease has demonstrated safety. The limitations of that pi[INVESTIGATOR_473524]  (1 patient died with massive intracranial bleed) , inclusion of only stable CAD, and no 
genotype guidance. Our study is a natural, provocative iteration of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -free, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473525].  
Proposed Strategy to Reduce Ischemic Hazard : Cardiac mortality due to MI dominates in the first week after PCI, and the mortality 
risk is relatively high for 2 weeks after PCI.17 The risk of acute or subacute stent thrombosis with current generation stents is low. 
Utilization of CYP2C19  genotype –guided prescription of oral P2Y12 inhibitor therapy after PCI may improve that ischemic risk by 
[CONTACT_473555]2C1 [ADDRESS_606770] hoc analysis from the TAILOR -PCI, 
80% risk reduction in ischemic events with genotype -guided oral P2Y12 inhibitor therapy  was seen  in the first 3 months after PCI .20 
High prevalence (50% -70%) of non -carriers of CYP2C19 allows very early deescalation into clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473526] P2Y12 inhibitors with higher bleeding risk only to patients with CYP2C19 LOF allele.  PDB and ischemic 
PCI data will be actively monitored and entered from same number of controls deemed to have HBR.  The central goal of our proposal 
is to address the unmet need of an effective P2Y12 inhibitor protocol among patients with HBR who undergo PCI to lower the ir 
incidence of PDB  by [CONTACT_473556]2C19 genotype. This will allow  individualizing antiplatelet treatment 
while  potentially  lowering their bleeding and ischemic hazards.  
 
APPROACH: Methodology  – General Methods  
1. Design Overview . For Aim [ADDRESS_606771] -dismissal cardiac death/spontaneous MI <30 days or stent thrombosis <[ADDRESS_606772]-dismissal assessment for BARC 3 or 5 bleeding, all -cause death, any MI, and/or 
repeat revascularization up to 180 days.  Informed consent followed by [CONTACT_473557] . 
Loading dose of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (600  mg) will be given to all patients and maintenance dose of 75 mg daily will be given, as 
indicated.  We will allow patients to be given loading dose (324  mg) of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_473527]. The choice of 
stents, access site and treatment site will be at the discretion of the treating physician  (Figure 1).  
2.  Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473528]/ ticagrelor  administration . This study will be single -center, single -arm, open label, first -in-human, and a 
proof -of-concept, pi[INVESTIGATOR_473529]. All participants in the first 
week will receive clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473530] 
(600 mg) and maintenance (75  mg) 
and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_473531] (324  mg, if not on 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) and 81mg maintenance. 
Participants with HBR who meet the 
inclusion criteria  will be stratified  by 
[CONTACT_097]2C19 LOF allele . Non-carriers 
(or those with inconclusive results) 
will continue with maintenance dose 
of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473532] 75 mg 
daily . If LOF allele is present , they 
will be prescribed either prasugrel or 
ticagrelor monotherapy [prasugrel 60 
mg load, maintenance 10 mg daily; 
ticagrelor 180 mg load, maintenance 
90 mg twice daily; dose escalation 
with bolus regardless of timing of the 
last clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473521] ]. Prasugrel will be the preferred agent except when absolutely contraindicated (history of stroke/transient 
ischemic attack or active bleeding). Patients ≥ 75 years or < 60 kg will receive prasugrel at a reduced dose of 5 mg daily. If there is 

 
5 
 a relative contraindication to prasugrel (as determined by [CONTACT_1963]), the participant will be given ticagrelor.  
Maintenance aspi[INVESTIGATOR_473533]. (Figure 1). 
3. Medication adherence, provision of prasugrel/t icagrelor and follow -up: Each enrolled p articipant  will be carefully followed , pre-
dismissal education about medication compliance and potential switch to prasugrel or ticagrelor will be given to each participant. 
A phone call by [CONTACT_473558] w eek of 
PCI. Study coordinator will mail [ADDRESS_606773] initiation of the loading and mainte nance dose. The number of remaining tablets 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_692]) at [ADDRESS_606774] review to assess follow -up. All cardiovascular -related end points and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473534] a nd P2Y12 inhibitor received by [CONTACT_102]. Only 
study -related events confirmed by [CONTACT_473559].  
4. Trial Duration : [ADDRESS_606775] 80% risk reduction for ischemic events with genotype guidance 
in the first [ADDRESS_606776] ( DSMB ): All deaths will be considered cardiac unless a clear 
noncardiac cause can be ascertained. Spontaneous MI will be defined according to the fourth universal definition.21 Periprocedural 
MI (< [ADDRESS_606777] -PCI) will be defined according to the 2013 definition of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and 
Interventions.22 Stent thrombosis will be defined and classified according to the Academic Research Consortium –2 definition.23 
BARC bleeding will be defined as previously reported.24 All endpoints will be independently adjudicated by [CONTACT_473560]. An independent DSMB will oversee the individual and collective safety of the patients in the study during enrollme nt 
and follow -up. To provide the steering committee with tim ely feedback on potential safety issues, the DSMB will review the data 
3 times during the trial : (1) When the 25th patient is enrolled, (2) when the 50th patient is enrolled, (3) when the 100th patient is 
enrolled, and (4) when the 100th actively enrolled patient completes 1 -month follow -up.  
6. Subjects  
a) Inclusion Criteria : Informed consent  after successful 
PCI [no non-fatal MI /stroke /repeat target 
revascularization /bleeding /acute kidney injury ] and 
academic research consortium -high bleeding risk (ARC -
HBR) score ≥4 . 
b) Exclusion Criteria : Chronic use of warfarin or direct oral 
anticoagulant (DOAC), u nsuccessful PCI (see above), 
lesion s with angiographic thrombus, prior PCI within 6 
months  (except for staged PCIs within the same 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_165148] 7 days of initial PCI , in which 
case enrollment will occur following the final 
planned/staged PCI) , planned PCI greater than 7 days but 
less than 6 months following index PCI,  planned 
surgical intervention to treat any cardiac or noncardiac 
condition within 6 months  (excluding transcutaneous 
valve interventions and pacemakers ), high risk 
lesion /stent characteristics (>50% unprotected left main 
disease, bifurcation disease requiring 2 stents technique, 
rotational atherec tomy, vein graft , unprotected left main 
intervention, or history of definite stent thrombosis ), 
women of child -bearing age unless negative pregnancy test is done, life expectancy <1 year, known drug /alcohol 
dependence, and assessment that the patient will not be 
compliant with the study protocol.  
c) Subject Accrual Plan : The recruitment will be drawn 
from the Earl Wood Cardiac Catheterization  Laboratory 
(>1,500 PCIs /year)  and Cardiology inpatient services at 
St. Mary’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Day 1 will include screening 
following successful PCI, bleeding risk calculation 
(ARC -HBR), enrollment, informed consent, and clinical 
CYP2C19 assay collection. On day 30, a study 
coordinator phone call will occur to assess ischemic  
symptoms, readmission, and bleeding. On day 90, a 
study coordinator phone call will again assess ischemic 
symptoms, readmissions, and bleeding. All encounters 
will include drug education and assurance of 
compliance.  
d) Reassessment:  The study coordinator will make phone 
calls at one and three months to inquire about ischemic 
symptoms, readmissions at other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473535], or 
any bleeding.  
 
7. Control Cohort : A cohort of similar patients will be identified from the Mayo Clinic catheterization laboratory PCI 
registry to determine rates of ischemic and bleeding events in a cohort of HBR post -PCI patients reveiving standard of 
care DAPT after PCI. These patients will be identified by [CONTACT_473561], and we will utilize ICD diagnosis codes to 
identify bleeding and ischemic events. Retrospective chart review will verify the clinical situation to ensure the validity 
of the coded diagnoses (to minimize  errors inherent to diagnosis coding). There will be no direct patient contact, and 
patients who refused registry research participation will be excluded from this study. We aim to obtain the following

Aim 1: Detailed Approach  
The objective of aim [ADDRESS_606778] week of DAPT initiation, non -carriers will receive clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473536] , and prasugrel/ ticagrelor 
will be given to patients with CYP2C19 LOF allele. The rationale  for this aim is  to individualize antiplatelet therapy and to 
reduce bleeding risk by [CONTACT_473562] P2Y12 pharmacotherapy by [CONTACT_2750]2C19 LOF genotype. Large number (50% -70%) of 
patients are non -carriers and in them clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473537], cost, and unique adverse effects  related to ticagrelor  (e.g., bradycardia, dyspnea) or 
excess bleeding related to prasugrel . Recruitment should not be a challenge at Mayo Clinic, [COMPANY_002]ster where 30% of PCI 
patients are HBR.  
Background . The highest risk for readmissions for bleeding is within 30 days of discharge , and those with PDB are also at 
heightened ischemic risk for death/MI within the first [ADDRESS_606779] 
abbreviated the DAPT duration ( 1-3 months ) or have deescalated the intensity of P2Y12 inhibitors only after this critical period 
is over. There is an urgent need to test early antiplatelet deescalation leveraging CYP2C19 -LOF alle le-based stratification.  
Preliminary Studies . HBR patients represent 30% 
of all patients who underwent PCI in the Mayo 
Clinic, [COMPANY_002]ster catheterization laboratory 
between January 2010 and July 2021.  Role of 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_473538]: TAILOR PCI 
demonstrated a 34% risk reduction of ischemic 
events ( HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 -1.02, p=0.06) at [ADDRESS_606780] 80% risk reduction 
(p=0.001) for ischemic events with genotype 
guidance in the first [ADDRESS_606781] 
risk period following PCI. A recent meta -analysis 
using data from 7 randomized control trials with 
15,949 patients demonstrates a 30% risk reduction  in ischemic events (95% CI 0.59 -0.83) in CYP2C19 LOF  allele patients with 
the use of ticagrelor/prasugrel vs clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123943] a RR of 1.0 (95% CI 0.80 -1.25) in wild -type or no LOF patients  indicating 
that CYP2C19 genotype played a significant role in driving the benefit of ticagrelor/prasugrel.25  
Research Design   
1. Assessment of high bleeding risk : Academic Research Consortium (ARC) defined 1 -year high bleeding risk as a BARC 3 or 
5 risk of ≥4% or a risk of intracranial hemorrhage of ≥1%.[ADDRESS_606782] 1 major or 2 
minor risk criteria are met . This model successfully identified high bleeding risk patients following PCI.27  
2. Assessment of CYP2C19LOF Allele:  Clinical CYP2C19 assay will be run on QuantStudio with Chemagic DNA extraction 
that assesses CYP2C19 (*2, *10, *17, *35) The results will be expected within [ADDRESS_606783]-PCI. Close monitoring  of participants receiving clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473539]/ ticagrelor  monotherapy for any cardiac deaths, spontaneous MI and stent thrombosis will be done . 
Potential Problems and Alternative Strategies.  The results of genotype -based assay will be available at or following the 
participant’s discharge. To ensure compliance with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473540]2C19 LOF 
allele, the study coordinator will call them with the results , mail the 90 -day prescription for prasugrel or ticagrelor and ensure its 
receipt and initiation.  Based on the expert consensus, pharmacodynamic data , escalation in 
patients with CYP2C19 *2 or  *[ADDRESS_606784] maintenance dose of prasugrel 10 mg daily 
(5 mg if age ≥ 75 years or weight < 60 kg) or ticagrelor [ADDRESS_606785] of successfully enrolling  participants  into 

 
10 
 clinical trials , including genotype -directed randomization for the TAILOR PCI trial . We will approach potential participants for 
informed consent before dismissal following the PCI procedure.  For participant with same -day dismissal , we will approach 
them either before coronary angiography or pre -dismissal once the sedation from the procedure wears off.  
Aim 2: Detailed Approach   
Aim [ADDRESS_606786]-PCI at Mayo Clinic, [COMPANY_002]ster is presented in Table 2 . 
Introduction . PDB is common and is seen in approximately 5% and 20% of those bleeds manifest in the first month following 
PCI. Longer observation is needed to accurately define its incidence, source, severity, and time dependency. The ischemic 
hazard usually follows adm ission due to PDB and is likely due to interruption or discontinuation of DAPT. Insights into its time 
course, relationship with antecedent bleeding, type of MI (STEMI vs. NSTEMI) and prognosis are equally relevant. 
Prolongation of observation is critical to delineate time course of both bleeding and ischemic hazards. The objectives of Aim [ADDRESS_606787] balance between ischemic and bleeding risks after PCI. Shortening of DAPT duration 
is safe and has not demonstrated an increase  in the incidence of ischemic risk. The limitations of the existing  trials are, 1) that 
DAPT is given for [ADDRESS_606788] month following PCI  that 
overlaps with high risk period for PDB, 2) TWILIGHT trial randomized higher -risk patients only after demonstrating no 
ischemia or ble eding for the initial 3 months following PCI thereby [CONTACT_473563] -risk patients for PDB, 3) ASET pi[INVESTIGATOR_473541] -risk, stable patients who were given prasugrel. Older age is one of the main drivers of bleeding and along 
with prior TIA /stroke, or low body weight will significantly limit the applicability of monotherapy with prasugrel. In that 
regard, individualizing P2Y12 therapy guided by [CONTACT_37688][INVESTIGATOR_473542] g non -carriers (prevalence of 60% -70%) and limiting the use of newer P2Y12 inhibitors to the rest. 
Accurate assessment and prolongation of period of observation is relevant especially among participants presenting with ACS.  
The central goal of Aim [ADDRESS_606789] 6 months following PCI with DES. 
This aim  leverages the support from existing Mayo Clinic PCI database in whom all the information is routinely collected 
following a coronary intervention.  
Preliminary Studies . Research Design : Same 150 participants from Aim 1 will be enrolled, however, data for Aim 2 will be 
collected at  six months. Our main strategy for this aim is to demonstrate whether clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473536], guided by [CONTACT_7631], 
is associated with lower bleeding and ischemic events during extended period of observation , especially relevant in participants 
presenting with ACS.  Expected Outcomes : Upon completion, we will have comprehensive data on incidence, severity, 
predictors, type, and time trends for both PDB and isch emia.  In recent years, several trials have analyzed PCI in HBR patients 
examining DAPT regimens and outcomes to balance the risk of ischemia and bleeding. Table 3  (see supplemental material) 
summarizes these key trials.  Extending the period of observation allows us to monitor the participants longer and demonstrate 
the safety of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473536].  From this aim we will determine whether clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473543]-comers  
following successful PCI, especially  among participants presenting with ACS, as the current guidelines recommend at least [ADDRESS_606790] shown after completion of Aim 2 
that clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473544] 6 months of observation.  
Potential Problems & Alternative Strategies.  Participants may not  report minor bleeds. Minor bleeds are generally 
nonactionable and don’t carry the same prognostic connotation as more severe BARC 3 bleeds. We will, however, attempt to 
capture all bleeds, including BARC 2. Participants may be admitted to out -of-network facilities with PDB and /or any ischemic 
event that may not be captured routinely. We have a strong post -PCI surveillance program to contact [CONTACT_473564].  Specific adverse events monitored will include death, type I NSTEMI, STEM I, stent thrombosis, upper 
gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, lower GI bleed, GI bleed of unclear source, intracranial bleed (hemorrhagic stroke, subdural 
 
11 
 hemorrhage, etc.), ischemic stroke, radial artery access site complication, femoral artery access site complication, and/or o ther 
clinically significant bleeding event.  Drug  compliance may be an issue. To ensure higher rates of compliance, study 
coordinators will underscore the importance of  medication compliance  before discharge . 
Statistical Considerations : Sample size estimation : Due to the exploratory nature of the study, no formal sample size 
calculations  will be  performed. Continuous variables will be expressed as mean  ± SD or as median with interquartile range. 
Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages.  Stoppage Rule: On the basis of prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_473545], a sample size of 100 active patients is planned with a similar safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_473546] e of definite stent thrombosis.11, 28 -30 In the present study, if we observe more than 2 cases of definite 
stent thrombosis, the study will be halted and further recruitment will be terminated. The cutoff rates for definite stent 
thrombosis  is determined based on the incidence of stent thrombosis (1.2% at 30 days and 1.7% at 1 year, in the Bern -
Rotterdam registry) .[ADDRESS_606791] Timeline  & Budget : Year 1 will include IRB submission/approval. Patient recruitment and conducting the study will 
occur in year 1 and year 2 if necessary. Statistical analysis and manuscript preparation/submission will occur in year [ADDRESS_606792] is $100,000  ($99,987 – see attached budget) . 
Future Directions : The incidence of PDB  following PCI is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and the 
incidence will continue to grow  with the aging population . Safe, early deescalation of inhibitors P2Y12 remain s the cornerstone 
of management.31 Stratification based on the CYP2C19 LOF allele allows us to use clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473547] (ticagrelor or prasugrel ). Upon completion of this project, we will have identified whether clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473548] -carriers of this allele  can lower the incidence of PDB without compromising safety.  This holds great 
potential to allow for a much larger population of patients at HBR  to benefit from this protocol.  If this study confirms our 
hypothesis, the next steps will be to test clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473549] a large multicenter trial to determine whether its 
administration is safe and lowers the incidence of PDB. Further study would also be warranted to evaluate the underlying 
mechanisms of improvement and to demonstrate whether longer -term t reatment  (beyond 3 months)  is safe.  Finally, other doses 
and combinations  can be tested along with further research to define the optimal dosing duration and schedule. Prior to 
proceeding to these future studies, our study will test the concept hypothesis  that clopi[INVESTIGATOR_473550]. If our hypotheses are not confirmed, future directions will 
include testing of alternative ways to reduce PDB . In addition, routine use of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_473551]. Our goal is to better understand the  PDB bleeding among patients undergoing PCI with DES . If correct, our 
hypothesis will impact future trial designs and future practice.

A. IND Sponsor:  [CONTACT_392360] L. Sperry will oversee all planning and execution of the Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856187] (PAMPer) trial, which is a 4 year, multi -center, randomized, open label, clinical trial, and will assume 
the responsibilities of the IND Sponsor as addressed under 21 CFR Part 312, Subpart D.   
B. Study Site Investigators:  The study site Investigators will oversee the conduct of the PAMPer trial at their 
respective study sites, and will assume the responsibilities of Investigators as addressed under 21 CFR Part 
312, Subpart D.  
C. Coordinating Center:  The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_856188]-
coordinating center. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_856189], under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_856190], will be responsible for the education and training of participating center research staff and will oversee 
education and training of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856191]. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_856192], under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_856190], will be re sponsible for sample acquisition, 
sample storage, data entry via web based platform, and maintenance of data integrity.  
D. Study Timeline Responsibilities:  
1.  Pre-Trial Start Period and Year One:  
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_856189]:  The IND Sponsor, participating study site Investigators, 
consultants, research staff and data management team will develop the clinical trial protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, informed consent documents and notification letters, data collection forms, database, and manual of operations. An IND application will be submitted to the FDA in accordance with the provisions governing the conduct of this clinical trial under the Exception from the Requirement for Informed Consent for Emergency Research.  A coordinating center  protocol and separate study site clinical protocol will be initially submitted for 
review and approval by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_68348], and the [LOCATION_003]MRMC Office of Research Protections Human Research Protections Office. Once approved at these levels, the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_856193].  Study sites will be added to the clinical trial protocol following approval by [CONTACT_856352], and the IND application and Coordinating Clinical Center protocol will be amended accordingly.     
 
Participating Study Sites:  Study site Investigators will coordinate and oversee the execution of the clinical  
trial at their respective institutions. They will finalize plans with each of their respective blood banks for the 
obtaining and rotation of plasma to and from the helicopter bases. They will each submit their plasma plan to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_856194]. Once they have received an approved master clinical trial protocol, the study site investigators and their research team will submit the protocol to their 
respective IRB’s and follow local and federal regulations and guidelines relevant to this research; i.e.: 21 CFR 
50.24, Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research, the harmonized U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations; 21 CFR Part 312, Investigational New Drug Application; and DOD Directive DODD 3216.02. No research at any site will commence until approval from the responsible IRB and the [LOCATION_003]MRMC ORP HRPO has been received.  
 
2. Year Two: 
 
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_1192276] completed the clinical trial protocol, an initial interim analysis with be 
completed with a focus on safety.      Phase system analysts at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_856195] a web-based secure 
server to link sites with relevant information; a pass -word protected, electronic Case Report Form for data 
entry; and training modules for the conduct of the clinical trial protocol  including electronic data entry.   
Personnel will need to pass a test on the portal as evidence of their training and knowledge of the protocol and procedures.   
     Each enrolling study site will be monitored on an annual basis by [CONTACT_856353][INVESTIGATOR_856189].  Study sites having difficulty with addressing the provisions associated with the Exception from the Requirement for Informed Consent for Emergency Research, underperforming sites, or 
sites with multiple protocol deviations will be reassessed for ability to continue. If unable to improve, they may 
be replaced.  
Two formal interim analyses of efficacy will be performed when 33% and 67% of the expected number of primary events had accrued (about one month after  1/3 and 2/[ADDRESS_1192277] accruals).  
 An estimated additional 150 patients will be enrolled (total=260 ) by [CONTACT_856354], and blood samples will 
be batch analyzed for cytokine and protein C constituents. Continued prospective data collection and integrity verification for clinical outcomes will occur.  
 
3. Year Three: 
An estimated additional 150 patients will be enrolled (total=410 ) by [CONTACT_392308], and blood samples will be 
batched analyzed for cytokine and protein C constituents. Continued prospective data collection and integrity verification for clinical outcomes will occur . 
 
4. Year Four: 
An estimated additional 120 patients will be enrolled (estimated total= 530 ) by 9 months into the fourth year, 
with completion of analyses for cytokine and protein C constituents once we meet our enrollment. Prospective 
data collection will be completed and final integrity verification for all data will occur. Final data analysis will be 
completed in the final 3 months after data integrity is verified. Manuscript preparation will follow soon after. 
 
IV. Study Site Information 
 
It is anticipated that the participating study sites/institutions will include: University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]/UPMC, 
University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern, University of Tennessee, Case Western Reserve University, University of Louisville and Vanderbilt University. These institutions have busy air medical transport services and existing affiliations with local blood banks. The actual intervention will take place en route to the trauma center, and follow up data will be collected up to 30 days, independent of discharge disposition .

The study will be a 4 year, multi -center, open-label, randomized trial conducted at level-1 trauma centers. For 
patients with evidence of hemorrhagic shock being transported by [CONTACT_856355], the pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856196] -B A plasma  (<1:50 dilution or titer <50)  will be compared to 
air medical standard of care.   
 
VI.  Study Design 
 
A. Background and Significance: 
 
1.  Uncontrolled hemorrhage and coagulopathy remain 
leading causes of mortality post-injury:  Hemorrhage is 
estimated to be responsible for over 40% of all trauma-related 
deaths, nearly half of which occur in the pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].[ 1, 2] 
In addition, uncontrolled bleeding remains the leading cause of early in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380].[ 3, 4] Ongoing hemorrhage is 
complicated by [CONTACT_65357] -known ‘lethal triad’ of coagulopathy, 
hypothermia and acidosis (Fig 1.).[ 5-8] It has been demonstrated 
that persistent hypothermia and progressive metabolic acidosis are associated with severe recalcitrant coagulopathy and resultant unbridled hemorrhage.[ 9-12] Although multiple 
mech anisms which promote or result in coagulopathy post-
injury have been proposed and studied, interventions that 
reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with 
hemorrhage and coagulopathy in the clinical arena remain limited.[ 13, 14]  
 
2. Coagulopathy  is common, occurs early and is a 
complex, primary process following injury:  Coagulopathy 
has been shown to be present in over 25% of patients at the time of trauma admission and has been determined to be an independent predictor of mortality with an associated 4-fold 
higher risk of mortality in both civilian and military 
settings.[
15-19] Those injured who arrive with coagulopathy 
also have been shown to have longer ICU stays and ventilator requirements, are more likely to develop acute renal injury  and multiple organ failure, and have a trend towards a 
greater incidence of acute lung injury.[ 18, 20] Prior literature 
has suggested that the coagulopathy which complicates injury is a secondary event driven by [CONTACT_856356].[ 7, 9, 21] Postulated mechanisms for this post- injury coagulopathy include 
dilution, depletion, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). [22] Dilution is thought to arise secondary to excessive 
crystalloid or colloid, or due to transfusion of blood products 
devoid of coagulation factors ; with depletion resulting from 
ongoing bleeding where factor replacement lags behind 
utilization.[ 22] In a smaller subgroup of trauma patients, DIC 
has been shown to occur and is associated with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ 
failure.[ 23] Evolving evidence suggests that these prior 
mechanisms, which drive dysfunction or consumption of 
coagulation factors, may be individually too simplistic.[24 ] 
More recent evidence demonstrates the importance of shock 
and tissue hypoperfusion as principal  drivers of coagulopathy 
following injury which may be required for coagulation factor

 dilution and depletion to become evident.[ 12, 20, 24, 25] (Fig 2.) These processes may in part be modulated by 
[CONTACT_856357]-protein C pathway.[ 20] As our understanding has increased regarding the mechanisms 
responsible for the acute coagulopathy of trauma, a new paradigm where early coagulopathy post-injury is 
considered a complex, multi -factori al, primary event has developed.[ 22, 24, 26]  
It is with this understanding that  the scope and magnitude of morbidity due to uncontrolled 
hemorrhage is demonstrated, highlighting the importance of the potential benefits of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856197] 
30 day mortality. 
 3. Diagnosis of the acute coagulopathy of trauma:
 As we continue to expand our understanding of the 
acute coagulopathy of trauma, emphasis has also been placed on diagnosing coagulopathy which complicates 
injury to allow real time assessment to guide evolving blood component transfusion requirements.[ 27] 
Increasing evidence suggests that historic reliance on prothrombin time (PT)  and international normalized ratio 
(INR) is time exclusive and provides insufficient information relative to the complexity which drives this 
coagulopathic proces s.[28-30] What is needed for the appropriate evaluation of an acutely injured patient’s 
coagulation status is a rapid, reliable assessment of the thrombosis and fibrinolysis arms of the hemostatic 
cascade. Thrombelastography (TEG) is a technology which provides a real time, viscoelastic analysis of these 
blood clotting processes.[ 27] (Fig 3.) Point-of-care rapid thrombelastography (POC r -TEG) differs from 
standard TEG because the clotting process and subsequent analysis is accelerated by [CONTACT_856358] a whole blood sample.[ 31] POC r -TEG is limited, however, by [CONTACT_856359] 4 minutes of blood draw to prevent clot formation unless the addition of citrate occurs.[ 31] It 
has been demonstrated that TEG can assess coagulopathy, platelet dysfunction and hyperfibrinolysis at an 
early stage following injury and is the most rapid available test for providing reliable information on 
coagulopathy in significantly injured patients.[ 32, 33] If not more important, the technology has been deemed 
feasible for use in a deployed military setting as well as for civilian use.[ 34] 
 
4. Aggressive blood component transfusion is associated with improved outcomes in massive 
transfusion:  Both allogeneic blood and FFP transfusions have been shown to be independent risk factors for 
poor outcome in the critically ill. [ 35-39] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_856198], the acutely exsanguinating, injured 
patient at times requires large volumes of these transfusion components until definitive control of bleeding and hemostasis can be obtained.[ 40-42] A significant amount of recent attention has focused on the prevention and 
treatment of the early coagulopathy which complicates severe injury and massive transfusion.[ 42-45]  Since 
2007, a large amount of both military and civilian evidence has accumulated suggesting that ratio -based 
transfusion strategies ta rgeting high fresh frozen plasma: packed red blood cell and platelet: packed red blood 
cell transfusion ratios reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with unbridled hemorrhage and massive transfusion post injury. [46-53] Thes e same studies revealed significantly lower overall blood transfusion 
requirements with shorter time intervals to receiving individual component transfusion, when these resuscitation protocols were employed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].[ 47, 50, 54 , 55] Controversy remains regarding 
the exact proportion of plasma or other blood components these patients with hemorrhagic shock should receive and the potential for survival bias when analyzing retrospective data[ 56-59]; however, consistent 
evidence suggests that addressing the acute coagulopathy of trauma is associated with improved outcome.[ 60] 
This evidence demonstrates that plasma transfusion plays an intricate role in addressing the early coagulopathy which is present at the time of admission following injury and that intervening early in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856199]. 
 
5. Predicting high volume transfusion requirements:
 With the demonstrated benefit of targeting high 
plasma and platelet transfusion ratios in those patients that ultimately require massive transfusion (defined as 
transfusion of >[ADDRESS_1192278] 24 hours from injury), it is essential that massive 
transfusion can be predicted relatively early, soon after presentation to the trauma center in a large proportion of patients.[
61] There exists an increasing pool of literature suggesting that this can be done relatively easily 
soon after (or before) trauma center arrival. The majority of these massive transfusion scoring systems incorporate laboratory values in addition to vital signs upon admission in both civilian and military settings.[ 61-
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

65] Consistently, these scoring systems include hypotension (<90mmHg) as one of the primary predictors of 
large volume transfusion requirements. The ABC scoring system consists of 4 non-weighted parameters and 
include hypotension ( <90mmHg), penetrating mechanism, positive focused assessment sonography of trauma, 
and a heart rate >120 bpm.[ 66] This score had an area under the curve of 0.[ADDRESS_1192279].  
 
6. Risks a ssociated with plasma transfusion:  Both allogeneic blood and blood components have been 
shown to be independent risk factors for morbidity in the critically ill. [ 35-39 , 47, 67] With their use a risk of 
allergic reactions, transfusion-associated acute lung injury, transfusion-associated cardiac overload, and acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], has been documented.[ 39, 60] These are hypothesized to be secondary to 
transfer of antileukocyte antibodies from allo-immunized donors or a resultant biological response to accumulated by -products associated with blood and blood component storage.[ 39] Consistently, these studies 
which have characterized the risks associated with plasma transfusion find no association with greater 
mortality. It is in those patients with hemorrhagic shock and early coagulopathy where the documented survival 
benefit likely far exceeds any complication risks attributable to component transfusion.[ 47, 60, 67, 68 ]  
The risks associated with plasma transfusion may inherently be minimized secondary to addressing and intervening with the development of acute coagulopathy post injury early in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856200] a reduction of 30 day mortality. 
 7.  Universal donor ‘AB - plasma’:
  
For this clinical trial, the early , pre-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856201]-cross -
matched plasma will utilize a rare resource, ‘universal donor plasma’  or AB 
plasma represents approximately 3- 5% 
of all plasma available and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_856202].[ 25] It is 
sometimes referred to as ‘liquid gold’. 
Due to the precious nature of universal donor plasma, the NIH blood bank has developed and maintains a special AB plasma donor program. 
(http://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/ab_plasma.html
) 
It is the precious nature of universal donor plasma which highlights the importance of utilizing air 
medical transport in this proposal. Air medical services cover large geographical areas and provide care at both the scene of injury and to those critically injured patients who are initially evaluated at outside facilities and require transfer to definitive care trauma centers. By [CONTACT_856360], the most efficient use of a rare resource can be 
accomplished with minimization of waste. Utilizing trauma centers with busy air medical services, who 
have relationships with their respective blood bank affiliates, will allow the successful completions of 
the aims and objectives proposed with minimization of blood bank resources due to the logistical considerations relative to ground prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_392092].  
 
8. Delay  to definitive hemorrhage control:
 Definitive control of ongoing hemorrhage remains a fundamental 
principle in trauma management. Increasing attention has been paid to the significance of delay and the timing 
of definitive control of hemorrhage. Clarke and colleagues have previously shown that delays to operative intervention in patients with significant abdominal injuries are associated with a higher mortality risk, demonstrating a 1% higher risk of mortality for every 3 minute delay in getting patients from the ED to laparotomy.[
69] Additional studies documenting relationships between delay and poor outcome following injury 
have been demonstrated for interventional radiology procedures and by [CONTACT_856361]-injury in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].[ 70, 71] Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856203] 4. http://www.redcrossblood.org/learn -about -blood/blood -types  
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

improved outcome following severe injury, however, scene time and overall transport times are consistently 
longer as compared to ground transportation in both civilian and military setting.[ 72-76 ]   
The results provided by [CONTACT_856362]. This proposal will provide needed insight into the 
consequences of early plasma intervention in these critically injured patients when these impediments exist.   
 
B. Preliminary  Studies: 
1. High plasma: blood transfusion ratios improve survival and 
reduce blood transfusion requirements:  Secondary to the 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]’s participation in the Inflammation and the 
Host Response to Injury Large Scale Collaborative Program or ‘glue 
grant’ prospective cohort trial, ( www.glue grant.org ), we have 
previously characterized the relationship between high fresh frozen plasma:packed red blood cell (FFP:PRBC) transfusion ratios in massive transfusion patients.[
47] We verified a dose response 
relationship revealing that as the FFP:PRBC increased toward 
1:1.5, a significant reduction in mortality occurred. (Fig 5.) These 
findings remained 
significantly robust after controlling for important differences in injury severity, temperature, shock parameters and operative interventions. Equally important, 
there were significant reductions in blood and blood component 
transfusion requirements in those with High vs. Low FFP:PRBC transfusion ratios. (Fig 6.) In a more recent analysis (unpublished, submitted to [ADDRESS_1192280]) aimed to debunk any question of survival 
bias regarding high plasma transfusion ratios, Cox-Hazard regression 
was used to determine the independent mortality risks at 6hr, 12hr, 
and 24hrs while controlling for important confounders. FFP:PRBC 
and platelet:PRBC ratios were also analyzed as time-dependent covariates accounting for 
fluctuation over time. We found that despi[INVESTIGATOR_392123], high FFP:PRBC and platelet:PRBC 
ratios are associated with a survival benefit as early as 6hrs and 
throughout the first 24hrs, even when time dependent fluctuations of component transfusion were accounted for (Fig 7). We concluded that the observed mortality benefit associated with high component transfusion ratios was unlikely due to survivor bias and 
that early attainment of high transfusion ratios may significantly 
lower the risk of mortality in massive transfusion patients.  
This previous work demonstrates that in patients who ultimately require large volume transfusion, targeted high 
proportions of plasma improves outcome. 2. 
Earlier more aggressive blood component 
transfusion is associated with a reduction in massive 
transfusion:  We have recently  characterized changes in 
resuscitation practice which have occurred over time in a cohort of severely injured patients requiring massive transfusion (in press, Journal of Trauma, presented at 
Western Trauma Association, 2011).  We demonstrated 
that the incidence of massive transfusion (>10 units blood) significantly decreased over time, despi[INVESTIGATOR_392124]. (Fig 8). When the recent time

 period (2007-current) was compared to the early time period (2004-2006) of enrollment for the study, there was 
a significant increase in the FFP: PRBC and platelet: PRBC transfusion ratios as early as [ADDRESS_1192282] 6 hours relative to the total given at 24 
hours significantly increased (Fig. 9). This occurred in patients who required 7-[ADDRESS_1192283] below the definition of massive transfusion. The data suggests that early, more aggressive attainment of high transfusion ratios may reduce the 
requirement for massive transfusion and may shift overall blood 
requirements below those which currently define massive 
transfusion.  
This previous work suggests that early and aggressive 
plasma administration may be associated with improved 
outcomes and reduced overall blood transfusion 
requirements and mortality. 
 
1. The potential risks associated with plasma transfusion:
 We 
have previously documented the independent risks associated 
with blood component transfusion (per/U nit) in a cohort of significantly injured patients.[ 67] Using Cox hazard 
regression and controlling for all important confounders, we found no association between plasma administration and the development of nosocomial infection. There was a relationship between plasma and multiple organ failure and acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]. A d ose response relationship was documented 
with the risk of these complications significantly increasing after 3 U nits of plasma (Fig. 10) . Overall, taking into 
account all patients in the analysis, plasma was associated with a significantly lower independent risk of 
mortality. For every Unit of plasma given (in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) the independent risk of mortality was estimated to be 
reduced by 3% (HR 0.97, p=0.02, 95%C.I. 0.94-0.99, Fig. 11  
This prior work suggests the mortality benefit may outweigh the potential risks associated with plasma transfusion; with 
the early administration of plasma having the potential to 
reduce overall blood transfusion requirements and further improve outcomes. These results are similar to prior military experience which documented improved survival for every 
unit of plasma a patient receives.[68]  
 
3. Feasibility of air medical service intervention:
 The air 
medical service at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]/UPMC is the 
busiest non- profit flight service in the country and has a significant 
track record of prospective trials and interventions.[ 77-80] The 
Department of Emergency Medicine’s participation in the 
Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium  (https://roc.uwctc.org/ ) 
further demonstrates the expertise and capabilities this service 
has with air medical interventions. A recent analysis demonstrates the importance of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856204]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473], need for 
emergent operative intervention and the development of multiple 
organ failure

2011) demonstrates the utility of air medical tissue oximetry and the ability it has to predict operative intervention or blood transfusion in the first [ADDRESS_1192284] been selected for their relationships with their respective air medical 
transport team, their experience with air medical interventional trials and their clinical research infrastructure to allow an interventional trial as described to occur. Air bases that will be utilized for the trial  will be selected to

 4. Feasibility of the AB plasma or low titer anti- B A plasma intervention:
 The collaborative environment 
between the Departments of Surgery, Emergency Medicine and Transfusion Medicine at the University of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]/UPMC unifies prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856206].  The leadership and direction provided by [CONTACT_209133][INVESTIGATOR_9109]/UPMC clinicians and investigators will also promote the successful execution of the trial at the other participating centers. [CONTACT_856446], as the Medical Director of the Institute of Transfusion at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], has the buy -in and support of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_856207] [ADDRESS_1192288] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856208]; thereby [CONTACT_856363]. This will allow [ADDRESS_1192289] 
thawed plasma available (up to 5 days) when required. As no clinically significant differences have been documented regarding the safety or efficacy secondary to the age of thawed plasma (1-5 days old), the potential for increasing the average age is possible but not clinically significant in regards to the safety of transfusion practice at each center or the execution of the proposed trial .  The storage logs will be with the 
plasma product at all times recording age and temperature of storage. The respective transfusion services at each participating center will have full and complete access to the storage records to verify that the plasma products have been properly stored prior to their exchange. Blood bank staff will verify age and proper storage 
before reissuing plasma.  
C. Objectives/Hypotheses: 
1. Study Rationale:  The effects of coagulopathy, hypothermia and acidosis are well known markers for 
mortality following traumatic hemorrhage. Increasing attention has recently been paid to the correction of the coagulopathy which complicates damage control resuscitation. Importantly, coagulopathy has been shown to be present very early after injury, at the time of trauma admission, even further substantiating the importance of early initiation of treatment. It is with this understanding that the magnitude of importance of the current 
proposal becomes apparent. Air medical transport is utilized for both civilian and military injured victims where 
delay to definitive care and hemorrhage control is exceedingly common. Delay to definitive care and hemorrhage control has been shown to be associated with poor outcome. It is in this cohort of patients where

centers, a [ADDRESS_1192297] (DSMB). Interim analysis will occur when 1/3 and 2/3 of patients are enrolled. A 3 month data cleaning and wind down will occur once enrollment has been completed, allowing 
data analysis and manuscript preparation.   
 
5. Military Significance/Public Purpose:
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_856210]-
injury management practices which have occurred over the last decade, uncontrolled hemorrhage remains one 
of the leading causes of trauma related deaths.[ 4, 5, 81, 82]  
To intervene early in the cascade of events which promotes and drives ongoing hemorrhage and the early 
coagulopathy that complicates injury has the potential to reduce overall transfusion requirements, alter the early systemic inflammatory response, and reduce the morbid clinical outcomes which are common in patients requiring large volume transfusion. It remains unknown the magnitude of effects associated with early 
intervention into this process. Importantly, the risks associated with early, prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856211]. In those patients who ultimately would not require large volume blood component 
transfusion, early plasma may be associated with a greater risk of acute lung injury or an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response in addition to any beneficial survival effect. The results and conclusions of the 
current proposal will allow and promote understanding of both the potential benefits and risks attributable to 
this type of intervention and this knowledge would have a direct impact on both military and civilian injured 
patients.  
 Due to the sparse nature of AB plasma processes and distribution procedures which efficiently allow and 
promote the availability of this product for prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856212]. The potential for additional blood transfusion 
components to be made available would open the possibilities of a flying or driving prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856213]. This potential knowledge base would be dramatically beneficial to both military and civilian trauma systems. It is in both these settings where the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856214] a relatively novel arena for new interventions.  It is anticipated that the results provided by [CONTACT_856364]. This proposal will provide needed insight into the consequences of early plasma intervention in these critically injured patients when these impediments exist.  6.  Patient  Benefit:
 The potential benefit of 2 units of plasma in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856215]. Plasma will provide needed coagulation factors  to begin to 
interrupt the coagulopathy that is occurring which represents the mainstay of treatment in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]

 [83] It is 
know that hypotension in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856219] a higher independent risk of mortality  and 
worse outcome.[ 84-86] It is in these patients where the benefits of early prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856220].  Improved outcomes have been demonstrated the earlier plasma is given after arrival to a trauma 
center.[ 87] Recent, published evidence has documented the feasibility and potential benefits of a 
prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856221]. The small study 
demonstrates that patients who receive prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856222], (as part of a plasma first resuscitation 
strategy) in patients with average transport times of 40 minutes, benefit by [CONTACT_856365][INVESTIGATOR_856223]: PRBC transfusion ratio throughout the first 24 hours, a reduction in crystalloid in

 the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], and  early treatment of trauma-induced coagulopathy which is a known 
independent predictor of mortality.[ 83] (see Attached Manuscript)  This prior and recent evidence 
suggests the current trial has significant potential to provide benefit to patients.  
 
VII. Research Design and Methods  
A. Study Design/Setting:  The study will be a [ADDRESS_1192298] significant experience with multi -center trials and the research infrastructure to 
allow them to successfully participate in this research study . It is anticipated that participating Institutions 
will include: University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]/UPMC, Un iversity of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern, University of 
Tennessee, Case Western Reserve University, University of Louisville and Vanderbilt University.  
 
B. Study Population:  Blunt or penetrating injured patients with hemorrhagic shock being transported via air 
medic al services from the scene of injury or from referring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114682] a definitive care trauma center  
participating in the trial .  
 
Inclusion Criteria: 
1. Blunt or penetrating injured patients being transported from scene or referral hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856224] 
2. Systolic blood pressure below 90mmHg AND tachycardia>108 at scene, or  at outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856225]. 
OR 
3. Systolic blood pressure below 70mmHg at scene, or outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856226]. 
 
 
 
Exclusion Criteria : 
1. Wearing NO PAMP opt –out bracelet 
2. Age > 90 or < 18 years of age 
3. Inability to obtain intravenous or interosseous access 
4. Isolated fall from standing injury mechanism 
5. Documented (radiographic evidence)  cervical cord injury with motor deficit  
6. Known prisoner  or known pregnancy 
7. Traumatic arrest with > 5 minutes of CPR without return of vital signs  
8. brain matter exposed or penetrating brain injury (GSW)  
9. Isolated drowning or hanging victims  
10. Isolated burns > estimated 20% total body surface area 
11. Referral Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856227]-patient admission  
12. Objection to study  voiced by [CONTACT_856366].  Although all reasonable efforts will be made by [CONTACT_856367], due to the nature of the emergency pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], there may be 
occasions where the air medical crew must rely on verbal report of inclusion criteria, including qualifying vitals , 
from the referring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_392164].  In these instances, if, after subsequent review of outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856228] 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017  
 
Page 16 of 86 
 and/or ground crew documentation, it is determined that the subject did not meet inclusion criteria and/or met 
exclusion criteria, the subject will remain enrolled in the study based on the intention- to-treat principle.  
 In the event that a verbal report must be used in lieu of physical documentation or directly witnessing the 
qualifying vitals, documentation of the verbal report will serve as the source documentation for determining 
eligibility.  Verbal reports will be documented in the air medical record and will detail the information reported 
and by [CONTACT_20898].  
 
C. Randomization:
  A single stage cluster randomization scheme will be utilized. Air medical services  at each 
respective participating institution (2 to 6 bases or helicopters at each center)  will be block random ized and 
assigned to the plasma arm or standard care (control) arm for 1 month at a time. The cluster  design will be at 
the level of the helicopter.  The block scheme will vary randomly between 2, 4, and 6  month block sizes over 
the period of enrollment for the trial at each participating center. Examples of a 4 month block randomized 
possibilities for a single helicopter or air base every month would be: PPSS, PSPS, PSSP, SPSP, SPPS, or 
SSPP (P=plasma, S=standard care.)  
 
Randomization assignments for each center will be determined prior to the start of enrollment following the above single stage cluster design using standard computerized randomization software. Communication with the blood bank transportation services and each respective air base will occur and a n annual schedule of 
randomization assignment will be distributed to all air base sites by [CONTACT_434]. This specific randomization scheme is required due to the limited supply of AB universal donor plasma and also due to the logistics of the intervention. AB plasma or low titer anti -B A plasma  is required to be delivered to and available 
at each institution’s respective air base and on board the appropriate helicopter which is randomized to plasma 
intervention. Due to these factors, patients are not feasibly able to be randomized individually  as this would 
require excessive amount of AB plasma or low titer anti -B A plasma   to be on board at all air base or helicopter 
services. Similarly, due to plasma distribution requirements, monthly random assignments of air base of helicopter services to plasma or standard of care reduces logistical demands for blood bank services and prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_378012]. Importantly, prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856229]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856230] a patient receives plasma or standard air medical care. However,  we will attempt to 
minimize ED and staff treatment bias by [CONTACT_856368]. Additionally, all steps will be undertaken so that data analysis will be performed in a blinded fashion. Sham bags will be distributed to all participating helicopters and air bases for the entire 
duration of the study and will be utilized in those months where plasma is not on board and in patients who 
meet inclusion criteria.  
 
D. Intervention:
 2 units of thawed AB plasma or low titer anti -B A plasma  not older than 5 days  will be infused 
in eligible patients who are randomized to the plasma arm of the clinical trial.  The AB plasma or low titer anti -B 
A plasma  will be that which is routinely used clinically; as collected, tested and stored by [CONTACT_123817] (FDA -
registered) blood collection and banking laboratories.  Those air medical transport bases  randomized to 
prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856231] (i.e., for the month of randomized assignment to the plasma arm) 
stocked with [ADDRESS_1192299] been properly stored prior to their exchange. A blood bank technician at each respective center will be in 
charge of monitoring all units of plasma at each air base, the age of each unit of plasma and the timing of 
transport services used to transport unused plasma back to the blood bank facility. Storage records at that time 
will verify appropriate storage and age of the plasma prior to placing it back in the blood bank plasma pool.

 overall  study  PI ([CONTACT_856447]). The individual  pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856235].  
     Evidence has accumulated regarding the potential negative effects of excessive crystalloid particularly in 
patients with hemorrhagic shock . A standard operating procedure (SOP)  for crystalloid/resuscitation 
management for enrolled patients  in the pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856236] (SBP < 90mmHg) for a ‘goal directed resuscitation. (Figure 11. a bove) These crystalloid 
volumes will be monitored relative to transport time for all patients and across enrolling sites.  
Some of the  participating centers for the proposed study have the ability to carry uncrossmatched blood 
routinely on their air medical  services to be initiated during flight. The air medical protocols for these institutions 
to transfuse blood en route occurs when greater than 2 liters of crystalloid/ resuscitation are infused with 
ongoing hypotension . The air medical services carry only 2 units of PRBCs (‘O’ negative) carried in approved 
coolers, with appropriate recordings to comply with blood banking standards, with similar look back procedures 
as is being proposed for the current trial for plasma. These protocols are already up and running at each 
respective institution and will not be altered by [CONTACT_856369]. This has become standard of care for these air 
medical services. For the proposed intervention to be most applicable across the majority of trauma air medical systems across the country, we will continue this practice. The inclusion criteria for the PAMPer trial will enroll 
patients based upon the proposed inclusion and exclusion criteria well before this blood transfusion threshold is met.  In those patients who remain hypotensive after the 2 units of AB plasma or low titer anti -B A 
plasma, the respective institutions will follow their own air medical transfusion guidelines (transfusion 
initiation if continued hypotension with concern for bleeding after 2L of resuscitation or following 
discussion with their respective medic command).  Any additional blood en route will occur following 
completion of the [ADDRESS_1192300] for prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507441] (# of units) in all of our primary and 
secondary analyses and will further characterize this prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856237].

2.  In Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856239]:
 We have selected level 1, academic, trauma centers with busy  air medical transport 
services  that are recognized for providing high level care of the injured patient. As the intervention is sole ly in 
the pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], there exists the potential for in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856240] -center study  which does increase the study results applicability. However, to minimize 
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017  
 
Page 19 of 86 
 those differences where high level evidence exists for the early in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_392201], and 
throughout a patients’ admission, local SOPs for resuscitation and transfusion will be employed and monitored 
over the initial 24 hours and throughout a patients’ admission. SOPs for patients who are at risk of massive 
transfusion (MT) will target an FFP: PRBC ratio of at least 1:2 based upon currently available data. Similar  
local SOPs for PLT transfusion ratios (1:2) will be employed and monitored during the initial [ADDRESS_1192302] restrictive transfusion guidelines for each 
respective institution in line with the TRICC trial recommendations (transfusion trigger of hgb- 7.0 in the ICU, 
non-bleeding patient).[ 88]  
 
G.  Blinding:  Because of the pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856241], the precious nature of AB plasma and all 
attempts to minimize waste of this resource, the transportation required to have thawed plasma at varied 
helicopter bases, and to minimize the air medical flight crews’ requirements for the trial, the current randomization scheme at the level of the helicopter base was selected on a monthly basis and the intervention 
was unable to be blinded since transfusion of blood products requires documentation. However, we will attempt to minimize ED and staff treatment bias by [CONTACT_856370].  
 
 
  
H.  Outcome Variables/Definitions:  
 
1. Primary Outcomes:  Our primary outcome for the proposal will be 30 day mortality. It is this outcome 
variable for which the study will be powered.  
 
2. Secondary Outcomes:  Our secondary outcomes for the proposal will include clinical outcomes, [ADDRESS_1192303] measurements . 
  3. Clinical O utcomes:
 All clinical outcomes will be prospectively evaluated throughout ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517], and the timing from the day of initial injury will be recorded for time-to-event statistical analysis.  
 a. Twenty Four -Hour Blood Transfusion Requirements:
 24-hour blood transfusion requirements will  be 
determined by [CONTACT_856371]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856242]. For survival bias analysis, number of blood transfusion Units  received at 3, 6, 12, and 18 hours will also be recorded. Any initiation of blood transfusion will be 
considered completed. 
 b. In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] M ortality:
 In hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856243]. 
Over the first [ADDRESS_1192304] 24 hour period. 
 
c. Multiple  Organ Failure:  Organ dysfunction will be evaluated via a well -validated scoring system 
referred to as the Denver Postinjury Multiple Organ Failure Score.  Patients who are never admitted 
to the ICU or those with a length of ICU stay of less than [ADDRESS_1192305] a 
Denver Score of 0. The Denver score rates the dysfunction of four organ systems (pulmonary, renal, hepatic, 
and cardiac), which  are evaluated daily throughout the patient’s intensive care unit stay and graded on a scale 
from [ADDRESS_1192306] laboratorial and physiologic values are used 
for the score. MOF scores are calculated as the sum of  the simultaneously obtained individual organ scores on 
each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856244] a score >[ADDRESS_1192307]

 d. Nosocomial I nfection:
 Infectious outcomes of interest will include ventilator associated pneumonia, blood 
stream infection and urinary tract infections. Surgical site infections and post-operative intra-abdominal 
collections will also be recorded but excluded as a principal secondary outcome event so as to reduce the confounding effects of operative interventions which not all patients require. The development of these 
nosocomial infections will be based upon positive culture evidence during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. Infections will be 
monitored until post-injury day 28 or ICU discharge. Diagnosis of a ventilator associated pneumonia requires a 
quantitative culture threshold of ≥ 104 CFU/ml from broncho-alveolar lavage specimens in addition to standard x-ray and clinical criteria. Diagnosis of catheter -related blood stream infections requires positive peripheral 
cultures with an identical organism obtained from either a positive semi -quantitative culture (>15 
CFU/segment), or positive quantitative culture (>103 CFU/segment) from a catheter segment specimen. 
Urinary tract infections require > 105 organisms/ml of urine. All time variables to the respective outcome event 
will be determined from the day of initial injury, while the time to the first nosocomial infection will be used in those patients with multiple infections for time-to-event analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
regression analysis.  
 
e. Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury  (TRALI): Development of ALI will 
be assessed utilizing the 1992 American-European Consensus Conference definition [ 92] which includes: 1) 
bilateral infiltrates on chest x -ray, 2) a capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469] < 18mmHg, and 3) Pao2/Fio2 ratio < [ADDRESS_1192308] 6 hours from 
arrival at the trauma center as it is clinically defined.  
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

      Toy et al. reported a TRALI risk of 1:12,[ADDRESS_1192309] of practice for blood banks.  
 
f. Blood component transfusion and resuscitation requirements:
 24-hour blood component transfusion 
requirements for fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusion will be determined by [CONTACT_856372][INVESTIGATOR_856242]. Similar determinations for crystalloid requirements, colloid requirements (albumin, hetastarch) and whether the patient requires vasopressors (yes/no; norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], vasopressin or phenylephrine) in the first [ADDRESS_1192310]-injury will occur. For survival bias 
analysis, number of Units  will also be determined at 3, 6, 12, and 18 hours for each transfusion and 
resuscitation component. 
 
g. Coagulation Parameters:  During the first 60 minutes  (+ 12 hours)  of the initial in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856245] (for those patients taken directly to the OR), but after transfusion of 
thawed plasma if hanging,  blood for  PT, INR and point of care rapid-TEG analysis will be obtained. These 
measurements will be repeated a s close to  24 hours  (+/- 12 hours)  from the time of injury  as feasible, to 
coordinate with other lab draws and staffing patterns . We will also be performing additional coagulation 
biomarker assays at these time points. Tissue factor will be added to a citrated whole blood collection tube and 
rapid TEG parameters including activated clotting time (ACT, seconds), angle (α, degrees), coagulation time 
(K, seconds), maximum amplitude (MA, mm), clot strength (G, dynes/cm2), and estimated percent lysis (EPL, 
%) will be measured for each patient .  
 
h. Cytokine and Protein C pathway measurements: During the first 60 minutes  (+ 12 hours)  of the initial in -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856246] (for those patients taken directly to the OR),  
but after transfusion of thawed plasma if hanging,  blood for IL-6 cytokine levels, thrombomodulin and protein C 
levels will be drawn along with blood for coagulation analysis. These measurements will be repeated at 24 hours (+/- 12 hours) from the time of injury as feasible, to coordinate with other lab draws and staffing patterns . 
An additional blood draw will be performed at 72 hours (+/- 12) for additional coagulation biomarkers.
  IL-6 
levels rather than a large panel of early inflammatory cytokines will be measured; as IL-[ADDRESS_1192311] injury.[
93, 94] 
Altered thrombomodulin and protein C levels have similarly been shown recently to be associated with increased mortality, blood transfusion requirements, acute renal injury and greater ventilator requirements 
post-injury.[ 20] These outcome markers will provide information and insight into the mechanisms responsible 
for any beneficial effects of addressing hemorrhagic shock early in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. IL-6 will be measured using an ELISA immunoassay kit ( Human IL-6 ELISA Kit, Antigenix America Inc., [LOCATION_003]). 
Thrombomodulin and protein C levels will also be determined utilizing ELIZA immunoassay techniques (Asserachrom Thrombomodulin EIA, Diagnostica Stago, [LOCATION_003]) and (Staclot Protein C clot-based activity assay, 
Diagnositca Stago, [LOCATION_003]), respectively. All cytokine and Protein C pathway samples will be stored and batched 
at their respective institution and delivered to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_856247] A immunoassay measurements will be undertaken.  
 VIII. Human Subjects
  
We anticipate that this study w ill be conducted under the federal provisions governing Exception from the 
Requirement for Informed Consent for Emergency Research, including community consultation, public 
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_1192312] significant experience 
with community consultation and notification practices. The requirements for Exception from the Requirement for Informed Consent for Emergency R esearch and our proposal’s characteristics regarding these can be 
found in the Clinical Protocol Appendix 1.  Once a participating institution completes the processes for 
obtaining IRB approval of the research protocol, the IND will be amended to include the institution as a study site.  The respective information submitted to the IND application will include a summary of the community consultation process accepted by [CONTACT_3488]. Community Consultation Plan (appendix 2) attached. 
 Benefits of participation in the PAMPer trial for both plasma and standard of care subjects:  
     A unique benefit regarding participation in the PAMPer trial is that all research results for both plasma and 
control arms of the study may be used to further inform clinical care decisions throughout a participants hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. We have recently presented research currently in press  (Brown et al. Journal of Trauma and 
Acute Care Surgery, 2013) documenting the potential benefits of goal directed prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856248]. Based upon this knowledge for all trial participants, a prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_817590] (SOP) utilizing a goal directed crystalloid resuscitation guideline will be followed. Due to the variability of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856249], this will potentially benefit participants in either arm of the study. 
     Participation in the trial may also aid in early recognition of trauma induced coagulopathy due to the early 
measurements of INR and thrombelastography (TEG) which will be performed on all enrolled subjects. TEG is an FDA approved tool, however, currently it is not standard of care and only a small proportion of trauma centers across the country routinely obtain early INR and point of care rapid-TEG analysis in the emergency 
department, soon after arrival in patients in hemorrhagic shock.  Early recognition of coagulopathy for all 
enrolled subjects may lead to earlier intervention and in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856250].    
     For all participants in the trial, early and continual screening and assessment for  clinical outcomes including 
multiple organ failure (MOF), nosocomial infection (NI) and acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) will 
occur and will have the potential to again benefit all participants, irrespective of which arm of the study they are randomized to, as early surveillance for these clinical outcome may lead to beneficial effects.  It is the layering 
of standardization of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_83271], early diagnosis of trauma induced coagulopathy and additional early assessment and screening for important clinical outcomes including MOF, NI, and ARDS that highlights the benefits of participation in the PAMPer trial for both plasma and control arms of the study.  
1. Screening and Enrollment:
 Subjects will be identified prospectively by [CONTACT_856373]. The intervention takes place on board the air medical transport 
vehicle by [CONTACT_856374]. Site research coordinators will document and 
verify all trauma arrivals via air medical transport for enrollment. Those patients who met inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria will have been assigned to AB plasma  / low titer anti -B A plasma  or standard of care (i.e., 
based on the study site randomization code). Subjects not enrolled by [CONTACT_439064][INVESTIGATOR_856251]. Once in the emergency 
department, the subjects will  undergo initial blood sampling for our secondary outcomes of interest, and will 
have point of care rapid thromboelastography (TEG) performed for coagulation parameter measurements 
within 60 minutes of patient arrival and again the next day. 
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

2. Informed Consent and Notification:  If any subject or family member voice objections to being included in 
research at the scene, the subject will not be included.  Once subjects have arrived at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], they  will be 
approached for informed consent as soon as possible, or their legally authorized representative, if available, 
will be approached if subject is unable to consent. We expect most of these subjects to be unable to 
prospectively provide consent due to the critical nature of their injuries. We also anticipate that, in many cases, 
the subject’s legally authorized representative will not be readily available at the injury scene to prospectively 
provide informed consent. The subject’s capacity to consent will be determined by [CONTACT_856375][INVESTIGATOR_307] .  All consenting and notification will be accomplished by [CONTACT_856376], HIPAA laws, and the protocol.  For those subjects that expi[INVESTIGATOR_856252], next of kin will be notified of their involvement in the trial. 
In our experience, there is no single time -line that is appropriate for all subjects or families who are dealing with 
the end-of-life or social issues surrounding resuscitation from traumatic injury. The treating healthcare team can guide appropriate timing of discussions about our research.   When a family member refuses to provide 
consent for the subject’s participation in the study, they will be provided with a notification form approved by 
[CONTACT_1201]. Additionally, for subjects that do not survive we will send a certified letter, also approved by [CONTACT_1201].   
     We will keep a log that reflects the required steps for contact[CONTACT_856377]. The checklist 
will be completed for each subject enrolled and included in the subject’s research records. 
See Appendix 3 
We will attempt to notify the family as soon as possible in person. In the event that they cannot be contact[CONTACT_493552] (for example, if they are outside of the state), we will notify them by [CONTACT_279594].  Subjects (or their legally authorized representatives) may refuse follow -up and/or access to medical record review   as stated in 
the notification form. This will be documented in the subject’s case history, along with the date and reason for withdrawal. The study investigators may examine data that have already been collected in order to determine 
safety. Subjects who wish to withdraw also will be reminded that total withdrawal will prevent the investigators from identifying any potential adverse events. Outcomes for subjects who withdraw or who decline consent to the follow-up portion of the study will be assessed by [CONTACT_856378] (SSDI).      The original informed consents will be kept in a binder in a locked secure cabinet at each study site. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_856253] a binder in a locked cabinet. These documents will be kept for a minimum of 7 years after study analysis is completed. Then they will be destroyed. 
 3. HIPAA:
 language is included in our informed consent which contains adequate written assurances that 
protected health information (PHI) will not be disclosed to any person or entity other than those listed on the informed consent. This research could not practically be conducted without access and use of PHI for safety 
reasons.  
 
 
IX. Sample Storage  
 
     Detailed instructions beyond what is presented here regarding blood sample collection, processing, storage, 
packaging, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_22016] a separate m anual of p rocedures .  Samples will be kept for at least 
[ADDRESS_1192313] the sample integrity and document the 
conditions (for example: thawed, vial broken, clotted, etc.).  The plasma samples obtained during PAMPer will 
be maintained by  [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_856254] a -80°C freezer. 
 
X. Data  
 
1. Sources:  Data will be collected prospectively as patient care progresses. This will include a review of the air 
medical patient care report(s), Emergency Department and electronic/ paper hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097].  
 
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

blood and blood components, resuscitation requirements. 
 
4. Data Entry:  MACRO and associated internet technology affiliates at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_856255]-based HTML forms to collect necessary information from all participating sites. Web entry forms will have 
dynamic features such as immediate checks on data and relationships within a form and between forms. 
Details and clarification about data items will be provided using pop-up windows and links to appropriate 
sections of the on-line version of the Manual of Operations. Data encryption and authentication methods will be 
used. Additional features will be built into the web entry forms including: forms transmission history, access to past forms, tracking of data corrections, and the capability to save and r e-load incomplete forms. The subjects 
will be identified by a study number only. All clinical interventions will become part of the patient’s medical 
records including plasma transfusion.  All hard copy source documentation will be kept in a secured, locked 
cabinet in the site‘s research coordinator‘s office. All study documents will be maintained in a secure location for the time frame designated by [CONTACT_133032]‘s requirements. The electronic data will be entered and maintained on a password protected SSL website designed for this trial.  
     The data entered for the PAMPer trial will be maintained at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_392202] a relational 
database. The database would be housed in a virtual environment so in the event of a hardware failure it would migrate to a new host. The data will be backed up 4 times a day with full transaction log files in use and copi[INVESTIGATOR_856256] a secure service, Iron Mountain. In addition to the data server, the 
production web server will also be backed up routinely and as a virtual machine can be transitioned to different hardware automatically in case of hardware failure.  All Servers are behind an enterprise firewall and access has to be granted through the firewall even within the University Network.  Research laboratory results will also be downloaded to the study designated program.  
5. Database Management:
 A two -tiered database structure will be created. A front-end database will serve the 
web entry needs, using a database management system well -suited to handling updates from multiple 
interactive users. The data from this database will be transferred periodically (e.g. weekly) to a data repository 
that can be used by [CONTACT_108250]. These data sets will be the basis for data queries, analyses 
and monitoring reports. Various versions of this database will be kept as needed, e.g. for quarterly performance reports. Backup of data and programs will be performed at frequent intervals. Access to data will be limited to those who need access to perform their tasks. The database management system is able to manage large quantities of data, to merge data from multiple databases as required, to handle complex and 
possibly changing relationships, and to produce analysis datasets that can be imported into a variety of 
statistical analysis packages. 
 XI. Analysis Plan
  
 
The over arching goal of the study proposal is to assess the efficacy and safety of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856257]. All primary and secondary analyses will be performed based on the Intent -to-Treat principle and will include all 
enrolled patients grouped by [CONTACT_17628].

Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

 a. Hypothesis Primary Aim #1: Using the hypothesis patients in hemorrhagic shock who receive AB 
plasma or low titer anti -B A plasma  during air medical transport will have a reduced [ADDRESS_1192314] death is 
included in the data collection section of this protocol. If more than 15% of the subjects are missing the 30 days 
mortality data, our primary outcome will be analyzed descriptively without inferential testing. The proportion of mortality within each cluster (level of randomization) will be computed and pooled for both intervention and control groups. For our cluster design, the primary clinical outcome of 30-day mortality will be assessed as a 
fixed end point of time using test of proportions differences, pooled z -test with continuity correction applied. 
Our statistical testing is part of 3 sequential tests that determined using the O'Brien-Fleming spending function 
to determine the test boundaries at each look including the final analysis as described in our power analysis.[ 95] P value and related effect size with 95% confident interval for [ADDRESS_1192315] in this study.[ 96] The revised z -
value adjusting for clustering is calculated with following equation:  
                
𝑧𝑧−𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉
�(𝑑𝑑𝑉𝑉𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑  𝑉𝑉𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑉𝑉𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒) 
  
      As an extension for the above analysis, multiple regression including generalized estimating equations 
(GEE) will be used as well to adjust for cluster level covariates and to incorporate patient level covariates  
through a two-stage process .[97] This approach of modeling techniques allows the inherent correlation within 
clusters to be modeled explicitly and a more satisfactory model can be obtained.[ 98, 99 ] For this regard in 
utilizing a statistical modeling we will be able to identify the main factors that explain variation in the outcome. Our analysis plan is to adjust for the effect of related covariates before testing the effect of our intervention (pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856222]) rather than to maximize the proportion of variation explained. Ensuring that our modeling is hypothesis -led rather than data driven, we have considered the most covariates which are to be included in 
our model with the intervention variable fitted last (pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856222]). Of these covariates: prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856258], pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856259], mechanism of injury, head injury/GCS, age, 
and gender. The priority will be for base line covariates which reveal imbalance in between clusters or treatment groups.  Site as a stratifying variable will be included as a random effect .[ 100]  The number of 
variables that we may adjust our main effect for will be according to related relevancy  and sample size 
adequacy. We are also aware that we should avoid the extended enthusiasm in over adjusting to avoid diluting the intervention main effect of our trial. Sensitivity analysis of [ADDRESS_1192316] of imputation as alive on the treatment group for comparisons and related confident intervals. Additional 
statistical technique may be added based on DSMB recommendations. STATA software, StataCorp, College Station, TX, will be used in our analysis. Interim and final analyses of the primary outcome will be the same, 
and both adjusted and unadjusted p- values will be presented for all analyses .  
 
2. Secondary Hypotheses:  
 
a. Hypothesis Secondary Aim #1: Using the hypothesis patients in hemorrhagic shock who receive 
prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856260] -B A plasma  during air medical transport (Ppp) will have a lower 24hour 
blood transfusion requirement, a lower incidence of multiple system organ failure, nosocomial infection, acute 
lung injury and TRALI as compared to patients who receive standard air medical care (Psc) , we will test the 
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

 null hypothesis of Ppp=Psc versus the alternative hypothesis that Ppp<Psc. In testing the significance for our 
secondary aims, data will be checked for equal variance across clusters and adjustment for fixed effects and 
random effects will be incorporated in any modeling when needed. Assuming equal variance, we will utilize the 
two-sided Mann-Whitney U or  Fishers Exact test for these secondary clinical outcome comparisons. Time-to-
event analysis using Kaplan-Meier and log rank comparison will also be performed utilizing the timing of the 
secondary outcome event in days and censoring patients who suffer mortality prior to any outcome ev ent. 
Regression analysis of individual level data using methods for clustered data (adjusting the standard errors for the design effect) will be used in order to analyze the effect of intervention on the outcome variables adjusting 
for all confounding, covariates and expected interactions. Models will be compared with the likelihood ratio test.  
 b. Hypothesis Secondary Aim #2: Using the hypothesis 
patients in hemorrhagic shock who receive 
prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856260] -B A plasma  during air medical transport (Ppp) will have a reduced fresh 
frozen plasma and platelet transfusion requirement, a reduced crystalloid and colloid requirement in the first [ADDRESS_1192317] air medical care (Psc) , we will test the null hypothesis of Ppp=Psc 
versus the alternative hypothesis that Ppp<Psc. In testing the significance for our secondary aims, data will be 
checked for equal variance across clusters and adjustment for fixed effects and random effects will be incorporated in any modeling when needed. Assuming equal variance, 
we will utilize an independent samples 
Mann-Whitney U test for these secondary hypothesis comparisons of resuscitation volumes across 
randomization groups as they will not be normally distributed. We will utilize the two-sided Fisher Exact test for 
vasopressor requirement (yes/no) in the intial [ADDRESS_1192318]-injury across randomization groups. Similar analyses controlling for possible survival bias will be performed as proposed for our primary outcome, 24 hour blood transfusion requirements.  
 
c. Hypothesis Secondary Aim #3: Using the hypothesis 
patients in hemorrhagic shock who receive 
prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856260] -B A plasma  during air medical transport (Ppp) will have improved 
coagulation measurements as determined by [CONTACT_213395], PT and thromboelastography parameters as compared to 
patients who receive standard air medical care (Psc), we will test the null hypothesis of Pp=Psc versus the 
alternative hypothesis that Ppp<Psc for each coagulation parameter. In testing the significance for these 
secondary aims, data will be checked for equal variance across clusters and adjustment for fixed effects and 
random effects will be incorporated in any modeling when needed. Assuming equal variance, we will utilize an 
independent samples Mann-Whitney U test for these secondary hypothesis comparisons of coagulation 
parameters as they will not be normally distributed. We will additionally control for mulitple comparisons. Similiar analyses for the two time points will be performed (first 60 minutes  (+12 hours) and 24 hours).  
 
d. Hypothesis Secondary Aim #4: Using the hypothesis 
patients in hemorrhagic shock who receive 
prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856260] -B A plasma  during air medical transport (Ppp) will have reduced early 
IL-[ADDRESS_1192319] air medical care (Psc) , we will test the null hypothesis of Ppp=Psc versus alternative 
hypotheses (Ppp<Psc for IL-6 and thrombomodulin and Ppp>Psc for protein C levels). In testing the 
significance for these secondary aims, data will be cheeked for equal variance across clusters and adjustment 
for fixed effects and random effects will be incorporated in any modeling when needed. Assuming equal 
variance, we will utilize an independent samples Mann-Whitney U test for these secondary hypothesis 
comparisons of cytokine and protein C pathway moeities as they will not be normally distributed. Similiar analyses for the two time points will be performed (first 60 minutes  (+12 hours)  and 24 hours).  
 
3. Predefined Subgroup Analyses:
 Predefined subset analyses will be performed looking at 1a.) patients 
who ultimately did or did not required massive transfusion in the first 24 hours (≥ 10 Units PRBCs) 1b.) patients 
who ultimately required ≥  than 4 Units of  PRBC’s 2.) those patients who received or did not receive prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856261], 3.) those patients with significant traumatic brain injury (Head AIS >2) versus those without significant brain injury (Head AIS ≤ 2), 4.) those patients enrolled from the scene of injury versus those enrolled from a referral hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 5.) those patients with a preinjury history of vitamin K antagonist 
medication versus those without,  6.) those patients with preinjury history of antiplatelet medication, 7.) those 
patients who suffered blunt injury as compared to those who suffered penetrating injury,  and 8.) those patients with high versus low field to ED transport times (median split subgroups) .  It is recognized that the study is not

Page 27 of 86 
 appropriately powered for these subgroup comparisons and the results and conclusions formulated from these 
subgroup analyses will be considered exploratory in nature and will not be used as a basis for treatment 
recommendations.  
 
4. Randomization of Ineligible Subjects:  It is anticipated that there will be a small proportion of patients 
enrolled who receive either AB plasma/ low titer anti -B A plasma  or standard of care that in retrospect will not 
have met the entry criteria and are thus ineligible. In this circumstance, patients will be analyzed according to the group to which they were randomized. Subgroup analyses based on eligibility criteria will be performed if 
the number of patients so affected is large. However, based on the relatively limited inclusion and exclusion 
criteria it is anticipated that the frequency of this event will be low.   
 
5. Non-adherence:  In some circumstances, patients may receive standard care instead of AB plasma/ low titer 
anti-B A plasma  intervention when randomized to AB plasma /low titer anti-B A plasma for that month. Non -
adherence is most likely to occur in the case of the exsanguinating patient when AB plasma or low titer anti -B 
A plasma despi[INVESTIGATOR_856262]. Fortunately, this event is relatively rare. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_856263]-to-treat analytic design, these patients will be analyzed with the group to which they were randomized. 
 
6. Sample Size Justification and Power Analysis:  We have determined the sample size for this proposal 
and powered the analysis based upon our primary outcome (30 day mortality)  as this is a traditional trauma 
trial standard for evaluating delayed complications and safety of trial interventions, the benefit is 
durable, the outcome is  important to scientists and patients and provides evidence to support the 
most efficient use of the nation’s blood supply. All subjects will be tracked for vital statistics for a full 
[ADDRESS_1192320] left the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 7. Blood Transfusion at 24 hours Secondary Outcome:
 Baseline references for the average 24 hour blood 
transfusion requirement in injured patients with hemorrhagic shock vary in the literature and depends on 
multiple factors including shock severity, injury severity, age, mechanism of injury and transfusion practice at 
the institutions being analyzed.[ 36, 45, 47, 68, 101 -105] From these baseline references we determined that 
the average requirement for blood in initial 24 hours for patients in hemorrhagic shock is 15 .0±[ADDRESS_1192321] 80% power to detect at least a 20% reduction in 24 hour blood transfusion requirements.  
8. Sample Size Calculation for a C luster Design:
 To appropriately power the study for [ADDRESS_1192322] Response to Injury 
Large Scale Collaborative Program, ( www.gluegrant.org ) supported by [CONTACT_763250] (NIGMS) or more commonly termed ‘Glue Grant’ study and additional published literature to 
estimate our baseline mortality and effect size for the study. In hemorrhagic shock patients enrolled in the Glue 
Grant, patients who require at least 3-[ADDRESS_1192323] 6 hours of injury had a in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 21.3% to 
22.4% mortality, respectively. This is similar and in conjunction with prior published literature in hemorrhagic 
shock patients.[ 51, 105- 108] Based upon these point estimates we will use a baseline mortality of 22% for our 
power calculations.  By [CONTACT_856379], the intent of the trial would be to improve outcomes (30 mortality) by [CONTACT_856380], reducing the need for massive transfusion (> [ADDRESS_1192324] 
injury) and reducing the inflammatory response which blood transfusion has been shown to be an independent 
risk factor for. Again, using the Glue Grant dataset, for those patients who required between  at least10 units 
and 15 units of blood transfusion over the initial 24 hours following injury, the mortality rate was 7.6% and 8.3%, respectively. 
For our sample size estimation for the 30 day mortality outcome, we chose a difference of 14% (22% to 8%, 
see Glue Grant point estimates above) from a baseline mortality of 22% when comparing patients randomized 
to plasma versus standard of care. The trial will be powered at 88% with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, 
adjusted for interim analyses to 0.037 (interim analyses at 1/3 and 2/3 enrollment). The additional power will 
allow adjustment of potential unequal cluster sizes as this  could decrease the statistical power of the study. We 
considered a between group difference in 30 day mortality of 14% or greater to be clinically meaningful and of

The used multiplier of 1.75 has been determined based on the equation of (1 + ( ň - I) Ƿ), where ň = average 
cluster size) and (Ƿ = estimated intra-cluster correlation coefficient). Assuming a 1:1 randomization of equal 
cluster sizes, with 32 clusters of 16 patients each, with an estimated intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 
0.05, (as recommended when no previous literature or similar trials involving patient-level outcomes exist, [109-111] . With a total of 564 patients needed for this trail, on average, over the 3.5 years of enrollment for the 
trial, each participating center of will need to enroll 20-30 patients per year.  We will enroll 564 subjects in order 
to ensure that we reach our goal of 504 evaluable subjects for our per -protocol analysis.  
 
9. Missing Data:
 As a general strategy for missing data in this study we will concentrate highly on tactical 
approach rather than only analytical. Our goal is to focus on preventing missing data as much as possible. 
There is no methodology that can recover the robustness and unbiased character of estimates derived from a 
complete set of data.  
     We expect very little missing data due to the nature of our study design and with related heavy preparation 
and efforts from our parts to have a well -conducted clinical trial. The study intervention in this study will span a 
short duration in mostly prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856265] a considerable drop out during that 
treatment phase.  We expect about 2.5% -3% on average. We have inflated our sample size by 5% to reduce 
related effect on power adequacy.       In this study we will be attempting to maximize the number of participants according to the study protocol 
until all  outcome data are collected. Our outcome measurements will be attempted in all subjects who initially 
are enrolled into the study including those who did not complete the study and in a full ‘ intention to treat’ basi s 
for our statistical analysis.  
     For 30-day mortality, given the transient nature of many of the subjects, extensive efforts will be made to 
ascertain vital status. Batch searches of mortality databases will continue annually for subjects with unknown status, until [ADDRESS_1192328]’s vital status. If the subject was discharged to his/her usual residence before day 30, the research staff will contact [CONTACT_392337]/legally authorized representative (LAR). If vital status 
remains unknown the clinical site will request periodic searches for the subject’s social security number in the 
Social Security Master Death Index. For subjects not reported as deceased by [CONTACT_392338] 30 following ED admission, batch searches of the mortality database will continue annually until trial close-out. 
Date (and cause of death when available) for out-of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856266]; however, underlying and contributing causes of death may not be available from these sources. For interim and final analyses, subjects who have not been reported as deceased by [CONTACT_4475] 30 following ED admission from any of these 
sources , we will use multiple imputation for the final value. 
For sensitivity analyses we will report the data with 
and without imputation. We also will report an analysis consistent with that used in other trauma studies 
counting those missing as ‘ alive’ and ‘dead’ on day 30. 
     Data missing will be accurately documented with related causes, continuously monitored and  mitigated 
accordingly. We are not expecting missing baseline data as prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856267], therefore no problem should be expected in the precision of our analysis.  We are setting a minimum 
rate of completion for the study primary outcomes data equal to 80%.  A rate above 15% of missing primary outcome data is unacceptable for our data analysis  and will be reported as a descriptive outcome only. Single 
imputation methods will not be used as the primary approach in the treatment of missing data.        We will assume data missing is  not at random in our trial and we will use all baseline covariates and some 
of missing data might be determined by [CONTACT_856381]. A likelihood-based analysis 
including regression multiple imputations and random -effects regression models could be implemented in this 
regard. Missing outcome can be predicted from individuals’ observed data using model based on observed 
individuals. In our final analysis we will explicitly state the assumptions underlying treating missing outcomes 
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

 and justifying those using compressive data descriptions and sensitivity analysis.  Our sensitivity analysis will 
allow us to explore the robustness of conclusions to alternative plausible assumptions. We will follow CONSORT statement in reporting the number of clusters/objects with missing outcome data by [CONTACT_54012].[112] All methods used in treating missing data will be adequately reported.  
 
 
 
 
XII. Safety Monitoring  
 
 1. Adverse Event definitions:   
 
a. Adverse event  means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. 
 
b. Adverse reaction  means  any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 c. Suspected adverse reaction
 means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”  
 
d. Reasonable possibility .  For the purpose of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. 
 e. Life-threatening, suspected adverse reaction
.  A suspected adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” 
if, in the view of either the Investigator (i.e., the study site principal investigator) or Sponsor, its occurrence 
places the patient or research subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include a suspected adverse 
reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 f. Serious, suspected adverse reaction
. A suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
the Investigator (i.e., the study site principal investigator) or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse reaction, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Important drug-related medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] “serious” when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the research subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 g. Unexpected, suspected adverse reaction
.  A suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is 
not listed in the general investigational plan, clinical protocol, or elsewhere in the current IND application; or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been previously observed and/or specified. 
 
 2. Assessing and Reporting Adverse Events (AEs):  All adverse events will be documented by [CONTACT_856382]. Reporting forms will be submitted to the 
Coordinating Center (to include the IND Sponsor) and Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). All reported 
adverse events will be reviewed as to treatment arm and further classified by: a) Severity (serious  or non-
serious); and b) Expected vs. Unexpected. For serious, unexpected adverse events  felt to be associated with 
the research intervention, the C oordinating Center will notify the reviewing IRBs and the FDA/IND application 
in accordance with requisite reporting time frames.  
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_1192329]’s AE/SAE log and follow local reporting requirements.      SAE reporting for the PAMPer  study will follow the FDA guidance on safety reporting requirements for IND 
and Department of Defense guidelines as well as local IRB reporting guidelines. SAE’s will be reported within 15 calendar days of receiving the site report.           Transfusion services  at each respective enrolling center will rely upon their respective central blood bank 
to provide them universal donor ‘AB’ plasma. All participating blood centers will minimize multiparous female donor plasma as is current standard of practice for blood banks. The risk of complications including TRALI and 
are required to be specifically monitored for, recorded and investigated by [CONTACT_856383]. Any transfusion complication including any transfusion of blood products in the pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856268]. As the intervention is specific to the pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856269], all transfusion related 
complications will be assessed during the initial 24 hours from arrival and recorded. 
The admitting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856270], which will be the service which provides the plasma for the trial  
and is a participating center, will be responsible for investigating and documenting any adverse reaction or 
fatality due to plasma that was transfused during transport.  
      Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856271], temperature monitoring, administration, and adverse event reporting 
will be followed across all participating trauma centers. (see Appendix 4 ) 
     A summary report of the DSMB’s findings will be submitted to regulatory agencies. At least one specialized 
clinician from the Data Safety Monitoring committee will be responsible for monitoring data safety. All related 
unanticipated problems will be directly handled by [CONTACT_856384]. We will 
also follow Department Of Defense Unique requirements documentation. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_856272], analysis, and reporting of adverse effects using a standardized report form  (i.e., Form FDA 
3500A). The C oordinating Center will be responsible for all oversight of these risk assessments with monthly 
evaluations.  
  
 
3. Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856273]: 
a.. Transfusion rate will be compatible with the patient’s condition. The patient will be monitored closely 
during the entire transfusion. The documented start and stop times are directly related to the actual 
transfusion of the component. Paramedics will document vital signs and start times in the field. Study 
coordinators will assume responsibility of additional vital signs and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_856274]. 
b. The patient medical record shall include the following:  
1. Name [CONTACT_856441] 
2. Donor identification number of components  
3. Date and time of transfusion (Start and Stop time)  
4. Pre and post transfusion vital signs  
5. The volumeor  # of units transfused 
6. The transfusionist’s name (paramedic)  
7. Documentation of related adverse events  
     c. Procedure for transfusion reactions:   
This is modified from UPMC policy for Blood Transfusions to be applicable for this study.  
1. Careful observation throughout the transfusion allows for early detection of adverse reactions and 
optimal treatment, if necessary. All  reactions should be handled initially as possible hemolytic reactions  
and the transfusion must be stopped. Any adverse events associated with the transfusion of blood or 
blood components should be documented in the patient’s Medical Record and reported to the b lood 
bank/ transfusion service. Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856275]. If clinical concern for a transfusion reaction occurs, the transfusion will be stopped, and supportive care will continue. The concern for a transfusion reaction will then be communicated to the trauma center staff.  
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_1192330] common clinical events accompanying or announcing transfusion reactions are, in order of 
decreasing frequency: 
a. Fever, with or without chills  
b. Skin symptoms, hives and/or itching or rash  
c. Chest pain 
d. Hypotension 
e. Nausea 
f. Flushing  
g. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_68661] (wheezing, coughing or dyspnea)  
h. Bleeding at infusion site 
i. Hemoglobinuria 
j. Circulatory overload 
k. Anaphylaxis  
3. If an adverse reaction is suspected, the procedure below will be followed: 
a. Stop the transfusion  
b. Maintain IV access with Normal Saline and change the tubing. 
c. Notify the patient’s physician upon arrival to the ED and initiate immediate treatment as  
ordered. 
4. For all other blood products involved in a reaction, the transfusion shall be stopped and a  
Transfusion r eaction i nvestigation shall be initiated per standard blood bank guidelines  
5. Notify the Blood Bank of the suspected transfusion reaction. 
6. Collect a sample drawn from the patient as soon after the re action was detected. Send a [ADDRESS_1192331] back copy of the transfusion tag, the IV tubing used and the top 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_856276] 3 part form. The back copy of the 
Transfusion Reaction Investigation form should remain in the patient’s chart as the initial report. A  post 
transfusion reaction Urinalysis with Microscopic may also be ordered by [CONTACT_102]’s physician. 
7. The Blood Bank will complete the Transfusion Reaction initial  report and notify the caregiver of the 
critical results. Pathology  will evaluate the patient’s reactions, Blood Bank’s initial report, culture when 
indicated, and report will be documented in the patient’s medical record. Consultation between the 
Medical  Director of the Transfusion Service, the patient’s physician and Risk Management is  required 
when a fatal hemolytic transfusion reaction occurs. Further evaluation and FDA notification may be 
indicated. The participating centers Transfusion Service is responsible for  peer review and blood 
utilization practice.  
8. Look back procedures: Since the plasma will be tracked through the participating centers Blood 
Bank/Transfusion service  look back/product recall procedures will be conducted as per standard 
protocol. (See Appendix 5 ) 
 
4. Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB):  A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be created to 
review this study  and provide recommendations re. study continuation to the IND Sponsor.  After initial 
approval and at periodic intervals (to be determined by [CONTACT_942]) during the course of the study, the 
DSMB responsibilities are to: 
 
a. Review the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data and safety monitoring;  b. Evaluate the progress of the study, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant 
recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, adverse events, unanticipated problems, performance of the trial sites, and other factors that can affect study outcome;  c. Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as scientific or 
therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the study;  
d. Review clinical center performance, make recommendations and assist in the resolution of problems 
reported by [CONTACT_507509] ; 
 
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_1192332] the safety of the study participants;  
 
f. Report on the safety and progress of the study; 
 g. Make recommendations to the  IND Sponsor, and if required, to the FDA concerning continuation, 
termination or other modifications of the study based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study;  
h. Monitor the confidentiality of the study data and the results of monitoring;  
 
i. Assist the IND Sponsor by [CONTACT_57018], enrollment, sample size and/or 
data collection.  j. The DSMB will include experts in emergency medicine, surgery (trauma/critical medicine), bioethics  and 
biostatistics.  As a condition of Department of Defense funding, a Medical Monitor will be appointed and approved by [CONTACT_1201].  The Medical Monitor may or may not be a DSMB member. Members will consist of persons independent of the investigators who have no financial, scientific, or other conflict of interest with the study.  Written documentation attesting to absence of conflict of interest will be required.   
 
k. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68344], Health Sciences will provide the logistical 
management and support of the DSMB.  A safety officer (chairperson) will be identified at the first meeting.  
This person will be the contact [CONTACT_856385].  Procedures for this will be discussed at the first meeting.  
 
l. The first meeting will take place before initiation of the study to discuss the protocol, approve the 
commencement of the study, and to establish guidelines to monitor the study. The follow -up meeting frequency 
of the DSMB will be determined during the first meeting.  An emergency meeting of the DSMB will be called at 
any time by [CONTACT_414137]. DSMB charter is attached (Appendix 6). 
   
5.  Research Monitor  
The research monitor is required to review all unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, 
serious adverse events and all subject deaths and provide an unbiased written report of the event. At a minimum, the medical monitor must comment on  the outcomes of the event or problem and in case of a 
serious adverse event or death, comment on the relationship to participation in the study. The medical monitor must also indicate whether he concurs with the details of the report provided by [CONTACT_856386]. The 
research monitor may also discuss the research protocol with the investigators, interview human subjects, and 
consult with others outside of the study about the research.  The research monitor shall have authority to stop a research protocol in progress, remove individual human subjects from a research protocol, and take whatever steps necessary to protect the safety and well -being of human subjects until the IRB can assess the 
monitor’s report.  Reports for events determined by [CONTACT_856387] U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Office of Research Protections Human Res earch

6. Interim Analyses:
 In concert with the DSMB, prior to initiation of the trial, the final monitoring plan                    
will be developed to serve as the guide to the DSMB’s decision-making process concerning early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_856277]. In making the decision to recommend termination of the study, the DSMB shall be guided by [CONTACT_392339]: (i) a formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_392235] (comparison of treatment groups on the 30 day  mortality ), (ii) information on safety outcomes by [CONTACT_1570], (iii) consistency between 
results for primary and secondary outcomes, and (iv) consistency of treatment effects across subgroups.  
     We have designed this trial with a two interim look before the final analysis. Our power analysis generated 
assuming a total of 3 sequential tests based on O'Brien-Fleming spending function to determine alpha spending and test boundaries. We will use test of proportions differences, z -test with continuity correction 
applied and other adjusting techniques. The level of significance will maintain an overall p value of 0.05 according to O’Brien-Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_507450] a p value of 0.038; two sided, for the final analysis 
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_1192333] (DSMB) will periodically review 
the efficacy and safety data. DSMB will issue related recommendations based on comprehensive data 
monitoring and substantiated evidences. Two formal interim analyses of efficacy will be performed when 33% 
and 67% of the expected number of primary events had accrued (about one month after 1/3 and 2/[ADDRESS_1192334] 
accruals). The purpose of our sequential tests is to detect early  sign of superior efficacy and detect further 
apparent futility in the intervention group. This kind of futility monitoring and testing could cause this trial to be stopped as soon as a negative outcome of 30-days mortality is inevitable and thus it is no longer worthwhile continuing the trial to its completion. Such early termination for futility could reduce the enormous expenditures 
of resources, human and financial, involved in the conduct of trials that ultimately provides negative answer s 
regarding the value of the study medical intervention.[ 113]  
     Our trial’s lower and upper 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_856278] I and Type II error 
probabilities of the group 
sequential plan are according to the study assumptions and design. The upper boundaries are related to the formal efficacy testing at 
each assigned sample size 
(expected number of primary events completion at 33%, 67%, and 100%). The lower boundaries are related to the formal futility 
(safety) testing at each assigned 
sample size (expected number of primary events completion at 33%, 67%, and 100%). Upper and lower boundaries will be provided to 
DSMB as a guideline and could be modified by [CONTACT_392356]. With this 
sequential testing plan based on O'Brien-Fleming spending function, only an absolutely overwhelming 
treatment intervention can justify the termination of our clinical trial after a third of the subjects have been enrolled and completed a one month of follow up. If the trial has been ordered to stop early because of interim analysis, adjusted p-values will be computed based on the described analysis of our main clinical outcome. Unadjusted p-value will not be considered for final results interpretations.  
Our interim analysis is part of our three sequential testing as we have mentioned above. At each of the two 
interim looks, 30 days -mortality will be pooled across clusters comparing between the two study groups. Based 
on the assumed power analysis at each interim look, the z-value will be calculated and adjusted for cluster size 
and other adjustments (including within-clusters correlation) similar of what we have described on the analysis of our primary clinical outcome and as much as the accrued sample size at that specific check may allowed.  We have illustrated z -values for the upper and lower boundaries across interim two analyses and final analysis 
of a total accumulated alpha of 0.05. ( Figure and T able below ) 
     Further and in relation to interim safety analysis, safety data by [CONTACT_856388]. Data w ill be remained completely unbl inded unless the 
DSMB call for otherwise. The safety data of the study include serious adverse events regarding frequency, anticipated or unanticipated, individual description for each event and dates. Our periodic reports to DSMB  will 
include as well data on recruitment, data completion, data quality, etc.  Other data will be provided as well as any additional safety analysis upon DSMB request. Mortality will be reported as an overall in our periodic reports to DSMB however we will report mortality individually as treatment A and B at each of the trial two formal interim analyses. Secondary to limited funding, complex cluster design and multicenter nature of the trial, we are unable use adaptive design due to the possibility of substantial increase in sample size, however based upon a DSMB recommendation during our interim analysis if our mortality rate is lower than expected 
and requires less than a 10% increase in our pre- determined sample size required, we will attempt to increase 
our enrollment utilizing those centers with highest enrollment, limited by [CONTACT_856389], and taking into 
consideration the needed adjustment for type I error. O'Brien-Fleming Boundaries with Alpha = 0.05

For futility assessment based on conditional power we will be able to use SAS programs  (FindZa.sas and 
FindZaBI.sas) at each interim analysis to compute the properties of a futility assessment based on a 
conditional power computation.  
Based on the above analysis the study DSMB might provide recommendations at interim analysis for early 
discontinuation of the trial because of futility and related conditional power. Such conclusion is based on a fact 
that even further subject enrollments to a full sample size or even additional increase in sample size will 
unlikely proves effectiveness. Possible additional confirmatory analysis can be applied to consider any other 
efficacy measures and to provide subsets analysis based on centers and other  considerations.    
 
 7. Quality Control, Assurance and Confidentiality:  
 
a. Protocol Compliance: 
The participating study site I nvestigators will not deviate from the protocol for any reason without prior written 
approval from the IRB except in the event of the safety of the research subject. In that event, the study site 
Investigator will notify the IND Sponsor and reviewing IRB immediately, if possible, and request approval of the 
protocol deviation, or, if prospective IND Sponsor and IRB approval is not possible, the study site Investigator 
will notify the IND Sponsor and reviewing IRB promptly following the respective protocol deviation. The study 
site Investigator  will inform the reviewing IRB of all protocol deviations  and unanticipated events involvi ng risks 
to the research subjects and others, and will obtain prospective IRB approval for all proposed protocol changes . Persistent or serious noncompliance may result in termination of the study site’s participation in the 
research study.  
 Protocol Deviations: Due to the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856241], the relative focused inclusion criteria, 
and the short intervention period, we expect few protocol deviations as compared to other large multicenter 
trials. If monitoring reports  demonstrate evidence of continuing protocol deviations, we will analyze them to 
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017  
 
Page 36 of 86 
 determine if they are site specific or common across the study. We will note if specific inclusion or exclusion 
criteria are being misinterpreted, if a certain time point in testing is being omitted, or if a common set of data elements are missing. If the deviations are site specific, retraining will be done at the site. If the problems are 
study wide, we will discuss them with the other investigators, the DOD and the FDA to see if the protocol 
needs amended or recruitment put on hold.  
 
b. Privacy and Confidentiality : 
The study site Investigator’s  and members of their research team  will make reasonable effort to ensure the 
research subjects ’ confidentiality . Subject name [CONTACT_507540] a secure, 
locked, limited access area.  
c. Investigator Responsibilities: 
The study site I nvestigators will agree to implement the IRB approved protocol and conduct the study in 
accordance wi th Section 9 (Commitments) of Form FDA 1572, 21 CFR Part 312, Subpart D, and the ICH GCP 
Guidelines (E6, Section 5) as well as all  applicable national, state and local laws . The study will be performed 
in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
XIII. Study Limitations

Protocol Version [ADDRESS_1192362] outlined below each criterion stipulated in the regulations for this exception and how  our study design applies to 
these criteria.  
 
(1) The human subjects are in a life- threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, 
and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include evidence obtained through randomized 
placebo -controlled investigations, is n ecessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular 
interventions.  
 The proposed trial is a randomized trial comparing the use of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856287] a definitive trauma center. These patients are in an 
life-threatening situation with a mortality before discharge approaching 25% despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510]. The standard of care for 
management of these patients includes intravenous crystalloid while en route to definitive care. As reviewed in this 
proposal, prior studies have demonstrated that injured patients who require large volume blood transfusion have improved 
survival if transfusion of plasma in high or equal ratios to blood occurs. Evidence suggests that early blood component 
transfusion may reduce overall blood transfusion requirements and that addressing the coagulopathy which occurs early after injury improves outcome. Controversy remains regarding the specific ratio of plasma and other blood components 
relative to blood that is beneficial. It is known that plasma is associated with a greater risk of pulmonary complications, including acute lung injury and adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505];  however, whether these risks outweigh the surv ival 
benefit associated with early plasma in hemorrhagic shock patients remains unknown. Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856288].  
     We propose a randomized trial focused on evaluation of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856289]. Furthermore, we have developed the current proposal with also places an emphasis on the 
mechanism by [CONTACT_856391].  
 
(2) Obtaining informed conse nt is not feasible because:  
i. The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition;  
ii. The intervention under investigation must be administered before consent from the subjects' legally authorized representatives is feasible; and  
iii. There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for participation 
in the clinical investigation.  
 
The study intervention needs to be administered en route to a definitive trauma center from the injury scene or from a referring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (see discussion of therapeutic window below). In this uncontrolled setting, the hemorrhagic shock patient 
is unable to provide consent for study enrollment, is commonly unconscious or in extremis, and legal next -of-kin are often 
not immediately available at the scene, nor is it practical for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856290]. Since we are studying patients with hemorrhagic shock following injury, there is no way to 
prospectively identify individuals who are likely to become eligible for this trial.  
 
(3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because:  
i. Subjects are facing a life-threateni ng situation that necessitates intervention;  
ii. Appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the information derived from those 
studies and related evidence support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual 
subjects; and  
iii. Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical 
condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is kno wn 
about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention or activity.  
 (i) As defined, these patients are injured and in hemorraghic shock and are facing a potentially life- threatening situation 
that requires immediate intervention.  
(ii) Previous animal and human studies have been conducted, and suggest the potential for a direct benefit to individual patients who require large volume blood transfusion.  
(iii) Plasma has been evaluated in patients who require large volume blood transfusion following injury and has been 
shown to provide a survival advantage. Plasma has also been independently shown to be associated with pulmonary 
complications but no higher risk of mortality. As discussed above, there are potential risks to subjects that may have not 
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017  
 
Page 45 of 86 
 been observed in previous trials. We contend that these risks are reasonable in light of the potential benefits outlined in 
this proposal and the current poor outcome for patients with hemorrhagic shock.  
 (4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver.  
 
This study could not be conducted without the waiver of consent due to the need to administer the intervention in the 
prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856291] a definitive trauma center.  
 
(5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic window based on scientific 
evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative for 
each subject within that window of time and, if feasible, to asking the legally authorized representative contact[CONTACT_856392]. The investigator will summarize efforts 
made to contact [CONTACT_856393].  
 
Patients in hemorrhagic shock following injury have been shown to develop progressive hypothermia, coagulopathy and 
acidosis leading to further recalcitrant hemorrhage and multisystem organ failure and death. The potential t herapeutic 
window for addressing this process is during the initial resuscitation period, which occurs from arrival of the air medical transport provider on scene or at a referral hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856292]. Since this is an immediately life-threatening situation, it will not always be possible to contact [CONTACT_856394]. We will mak e 
every effort to contact [CONTACT_856395][INVESTIGATOR_856293] a 
randomized trial. Research personnel will attempt to contact [CONTACT_423]’s legal authorized representative as soon as 
feasible and a summary of these efforts will be documented in the patient’s chart. If the subject becomes competent during the study period then he/she will be approached by [CONTACT_856396].   
 
(6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an informed consent document 
consistent with Sec. 50.25. These procedures and the informed consen t document are to be used with subjects 
or their legally authorized representatives in situations where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. 
The IRB has reviewed and approved procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for a 
family member to object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation consistent with paragraph 
(a)(7)(v) of this section.  
 
All procedures and consent forms will be approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) of the study site prior  to the 
onset of the trial.  
 
(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of the subjects will be provided, including, at least:  
i. Consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried out by [CONTACT_1201]) with representatives of the 
communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn;  
ii. Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the 
subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical investigation, of plans for the investigation and its risks 
and expected benefits;  
iii. Public disclosure of sufficient information following completion of the clinical investigation to apprise the 
community and researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of the research population, 
and its results;  
iv. Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation; 
and  
v. If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not reasonably 
available, the investigator has committed, if feasible, to attempting to contact [CONTACT_856397]'s family member who is not a legally authorized representative, an d asking whether he or she objects to 
the subject's participation in the clinical investigation. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact 
[CONTACT_503771].  
 
(i) Co mmunity consultation as outlined by [CONTACT_392331]. Since the population 
eligible for enrollment includes all citizens in the study region it will not be possible to target any particular small group. Feedback from the community will be obtained by [CONTACT_856398]. If requested, bracelets will be made available that could be worn by [CONTACT_856399] 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

 do not want to participate. Public notification and community consultation will be performed as directed by [CONTACT_856400], 
targeted small group meetings or consultation with community leaders. Our institution has significant experience with 
community consultation and notification practices.  
(ii) & (iii) Public disclosures will be performed both prior to study enrollment and at the completion of the study in the form 
of multimedia press releases organized by [CONTACT_473]. These will include plans for the study including potential risks 
and benefits and a summary of the results of the study upon completion. In the event that the press releases are not 
widely circulated, advertisements will also be placed in local papers describing the study.  
(iv) The Data Safety Monitoring Board will function as an independent data monitoring committee who will exercise 
oversight of the study.  
 
(v) We expect that all patients who meet the enrollment criteria will be unconscious or in critical state that does not allow 
appropriate consent to occur. Any delay in medical care that would be required for the care provider to attempt to obtain 
consent from the patient’s legal guardian would be life threatening. Thus it will not be feasible to attempt to obtain 
informed consent during the initial therapeutic window. Requiring consent to review a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856294] a biased estimate of the safety and efficacy 
of the intervention. Therefore we will use exception from consent for emergency research which includes public 
notification, community consultation, patient notification of enrollment, and provision of an opportunity  to opt out from 
ongoing participation.

UPMC PASSAV ANT AND UPMC PASSAVANT  CRANBERRY  HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_200160] - Patients transfused  after October 
31, [ADDRESS_1192376] has no transfusion  records 
prior to this date. 
 
II.          CONFIRMING  THE PATIENT  AND IDENTIFYING  THE PHYSICIAN  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] - For patients since October 1988, the SafeTrace  Tx has the patient's name, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7965], birth date 
and sometimes  the physician.  If the physician's  name [CONTACT_856443],  this must be obtained from 
the medical record.  For transfusions in the pre-computer era, the transfusion,  the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and the physician  are 
verified by [CONTACT_856408].  Patient cards are stored in boxes stored in a 
warehouse  at National Business Records Management  (NBRM). 
Chicago -Patients transfused after June I, 2000 are in SafeTrace  Tx.  If physician  information  is not in SafeTrace 
Tx, the transfusion  entity will receive only the information  available  prior to this time. 
 
III.        RECIPI[INVESTIGATOR_856314]'s physician,  the physician who ordered the blood product, 
or the transfusing entity a letter notifying him/her of the lookback.  All correspondence  is sent by [CONTACT_856409]. For HIV, HCV and HBV lookback,  the physician must promptly return an enclosed confirmation letter to the 
transfusion service indicating  that they accept responsibility for patient notification.  In the case of HIV and HCV, 
patient notification includes the need for HIV or HCV testing and counseling.  If the transfusion service cannot locate 
the physician,  does not receive the confirmatory  documentation from the physician or the physician  refuses to accept 
responsibility for notification , then the transfusion  service is responsible  for notifying the patient.  This is done by [CONTACT_856410][INVESTIGATOR_600].  The FDA requires that the process of notification  be completed  within 8 weeks for 
HIV and 12 weeks  for HCV (prospective ) and 1 year for HCV (retrospective).

year; most do not.  Some box numbers have a very broad span; often this is because frozen RBCs from years 
before were used and put into the current box with the same letter series.  This means that there is usually more 
than one box on the list which could contain a given card.  The end number of the box is closer to most of the 
cards in it. 
2.          POOLED  COMPONENTS  
Pools ar
e given unique unit numbers  in the computer.  In SafeTrace Tx, the unique pool number can be found in 
the additional  information tab of the component profile  of the original unit.  This pool number can then be queried 
to get final disposition information .   In the PTS computer system, the blood unit inquiry for the original unit 
number will give P-number, and then this can be entered to yield the patient.  Pre-computer , when a platelet was 
pooled, the P-number was put on the platelet's original inventory  card and a new P-number inventory  card was 
made.  The P- series card has the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]'s  name, so if only the original unit number is given, both cards must be 
sought sequentially for  pre-1984 searches.  After the BOS mainframe  computer  system began in 1984, pools in 
PTS were entered.  Donor Counseling will provide the P-number or individual unit IDs from the mainframe.  
3.          OBTAINING  INVENTORY  CARDS/PATIENT RECORD  CARDS 
The Quality Department  secretary provides forms for requesting stored boxes from NBRM. 
After identifying  the boxes needed from the computer  list above, the request forms are completed and sent to the 
Quality Department  secretary.  They arrange for the boxes to be pi[INVESTIGATOR_856316] a few days.

 Introduction  
The purpose of this charter is to define the roles and responsibilities of the DSMB, delineate qualifications of the 
membership, describe the purpose and timing of meetings, provide the procedures for ensuring confidentiality and proper 
communication, and outline the content of the reports.   
 The DSMB will function in accordance with the principles of the following documents: FDA document “Guidance for 
Clinical Trial Sponsors: On the Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees”.  
 
Study Overview/Summary  
Objective/Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis will be that prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856318] [ADDRESS_1192378] injury. The 
secondary hypotheses include that prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856319], multiple organ 
failure, nosocomial infection, and acute lung injury; reduce or prevent the early coagulopathy as demonstrated by [CONTACT_856415]; and reduce the early inflammatory 
cytok ine response, thrombomodulin and increase protein C levels.  
 
Specific Aims:  
Aim#1: Determine whether prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856320] a reduction 
in 24 hour blood transfusion requirements.  
Aim#2: Determine whether prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856320] a reduction 
in the incidence of in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], multiple organ failure, nosocomial infection, acute lung injury and 24 hour blood 
component transfusion and resuscitation requirements.  
Aim#3: Determine whether prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856321], lower early IL-6 cytokine levels, reduced thrombomodulin and increased protein C levels.  
 Study Design: Multi -center, prospective, randomized, open label, interventional trial over 4yrs focusing on patients with 
concern for hemorrhagic shock being transported via air ambulance to definitive trauma care.  
 Population: Blunt or penetrating injured patients with hemorrhagic shock being transported via air medical services from the scene of injury or from referring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114682] a definitive care trauma center participating in the trial.  
 Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Blunt or penetrating injured patients being transported from scene or referral hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856224] 
2. Systolic blood pressure below 90mmHg AND tachycardia>108 at scene, or at outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507429] 
3. Systolic blood pressure below 70mmHg at scene, or outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856322]:  
1. Wearing NO PAMP opt –out bracelet  
2. Age > 90 or < [ADDRESS_1192379] with > 5 minutes of CPR without return of vital signs  
8. Brain matter exposed or penetrating brain injury (GSW)  
9. Isolated drowning or hanging victims  
10. Isolated burns > estimated 20% total body surface area  
11. Referral Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856227]- patient admission  
12. Objection to study voiced by [CONTACT_856416]: Eligible patients will be randomized to receive [ADDRESS_1192380] air medical care. To minimize waste of AB plasma or low titer anti -B A plasma , local blood bank affiliates in 
coordination with each participating center will exchange unused, ≤ 5 day-old AB thawed plasma allowing its subsequent 
clinical use.  
 
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017  
 
Page 64 of 86 
 Randomization scheme: Respective air medical services will be randomly divided into 2 groups by [CONTACT_856417], depending on each service’s organizational characteristics. These groups will then be 4- month, block 
randomized to either AB plasma or low titer anti -B A plasma  or standard care.  
 
Roles and Responsibilities  
DSMB Roles and Responsibilities  
This DSMB will  
• Meet periodically (see DSMB Meetings) to review aggregate and individual subject data related to safety, data integrity and overall conduct of the trial.  
• Review specific interim analyses for efficacy (see Study Review Criteria/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_392286]).  
• Provide recommendations to continue or terminate the trial depending upon these analyses.   
• Communicate other recommendations or concerns as appropriate.  
• Operate according to the procedures described in this charter and all procedures of the DSMB.    
• Follow conflict of interest guidelines as detailed below (see DSMB Membership).  
• Comply with confidentiality procedures as described below (see Confidentiality).  
• Maintain documentation and records of all activities as described below (see DSMB Meetings, DSMB Reports).  
 
Principal Investigator (or Designees) Roles and Responsibilities  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_392278]:  
• Assure the proper conduct of the study.  
• Assure collection of accurate and timely data (monitoring and data management).  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_856323].  
• Promptly report potential safety concern(s) to the DSMB.  
• Prepare summary reports of relevant data for the DSMB. (This may include analyses not otherwise outlined in this charter based upon findings.)  
• Provide an independent facilitator for presentation of results during DSMB meetings if requested by [CONTACT_4318].  
• Communicate with regulatory authorities, IRB, and investigators, in a manner that maintains integrity of the 
data, as necessary. (This communication is not the responsibility of the DSMB .) 
• Provide funding for the study and DSMB.  
• PI [INVESTIGATOR_392280].  
 
DSMB Membership  
The DSMB will consist of at least [ADDRESS_1192381] been selected by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_856324].  
As characteristic qualifications, members will:  
• Work professionally and meet qualifications for their respective professions.  
• Comply with accepted practices of their respective professions.  
• Comply with the conflict of interest policies specified by [CONTACT_392349] (SOPs) of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_856325], financial, personal, or other conflicts of interest related to the 
conduct, outcome, or impact of the study according to the guidelines specified below (e.g., engaged in any 
simultaneously occurring competitive trials in any role that could pose a conflict of interest for this study ).  
• Be independent from the PI, IRB, regulatory agencies, principal investigator, co -principal or sub- principal 
investigator, site investigator, site sub- investigator, clinical care of the study subjects, or any other capacity 
related to trial operations.  
• Not be on the list of Notice of Initiation of Disqualification Proceedings and Opportunity to Explain (NIDPOE) 
(http://www.fda.go v/foi/nidpoe/default.html) and/or debarred list of investigators 
(http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/debar).  
Although each DSMB member will be expected to serve for the duration of the trial, in the unlikely event that a member is unable to continue participation, the reason will be documented and a replacement will be selected by [CONTACT_978].  
 The DSMB will follow conflict of interest guidelines referenced by [CONTACT_9092], Financial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection 
(http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/finreltnn/fguid.pdf
). DSMB members will sign a non- conflict of interest statement 
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_1192382] and/or potential 
conflicts of interest (as determined by [CONTACT_201554]) will be reduced to the greatest extent that is consistent with assembling a 
highly competent DSMB. Any questions or concerns that arise regarding conflicts of interest will be addressed by [CONTACT_856418] [INVESTIGATOR_363379].  
 
DSMB Meetings  
Projected Schedule of Meetings  
An initial meeting of the DSMB will be held prior to any subject enrollment in the study in order for the members to review the charter, to form an understanding of the protocol and definitions being used, to establish a meeting schedule, and to review the study modification and/or termination guidelines. Subsequent interim and final review meetings will be held to 
review and discuss interim and final study data (adverse events, protocol deviations, enrollment summary and tables for 
overall primary and secondary endpoints).  Frequency of meetings will be every six months, unless the board determines otherwise.  
Meeting Format  
DSMB meetings will generally be conducted by [CONTACT_392351]. A quorum, defined as 2 out of 4 members will be required to hold a DSMB meeting. Critical decisions of the DSMB should be made by [CONTACT_203332]. 
However, if this is not possible, majority vote will decide.  
 
Open and Closed Sessions  
The open session may be attended by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_856326]. Data presented in the open 
session may include enrollment data, individual adverse event data, baseline characteristics, overall data accuracy and 
compliance data or issues, and other administrative data. Minutes of the open session will be recorded by [CONTACT_856419]. Minutes will be finalized upon signature [CONTACT_856445] [CONTACT_856420].     
 
The closed session will be restricted to the DSMB members. A facilitator or recorder may be requested by [CONTACT_4318]. 
Data which may compromise the integrity of the study (e.g., comparative data) will be analyzed and discussed only in the closed session. The minutes of the closed session will be recorded by [CONTACT_45453]. Minutes from the closed session 
will be  recorded separately from the minutes of the open session and stored securely by [CONTACT_45453]. Closed session 
minutes, finalized by [CONTACT_392352], will be maintained in confidence and retained until discarded in 
accordance with applicable statutory regulation.  
 
Following each meeting, a report separate from the minutes of the open and closed sessions will be sent to the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_856327] (see DSMB Communication of Findings and 
Recommendations).  
 
Study Review Criteria/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_392284], and guidelines / stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_758288]’s first evaluation of data.  
 
Safety Analyses  
The primary safety endpoint is mortality as observed during interim analysis.  In addition to the primary safety endpoint, 
the DSMB will monitor the following adverse events:  
1. ARDS (adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505])  
2. TRALI (transfusion related acute lung injury)  
3. MOF ( - multiple organ f ailure)  
4. Transfusion reactions  
5. Surgical interventions  
6. Complications due to specific injuries  
7. Other major medical or surgical complications are commonly observed in these patients  
  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130] / Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: Safety  
Termination or modification may  be recommended for any perceived safety concern based on clinical judgment, including 
but not limited to a higher than anticipated rate for any component of the primary endpoint resulting in adverse events, or 
unexpected SAEs.  
 
Efficacy Analyses The primary outcome variable 30 day mortality will be utilized to access for efficacy of the trial. Accessing this  primary 
outcome variable at each interim analysis will allow early termination of the trial for either lack of efficacy or excessive 
efficacy or benefit provided by [CONTACT_856421][INVESTIGATOR_856222].  
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

Adaptive Protocol Modification  
There is no planned sample size re -estimation; however if the DSMB reveals a need, the sample size calculation can be 
re-evaluated.  
 
Consideration of External Data  
The DSMB will als o consider data from other studies or external sources during its deliberations, if available, as these 
results may have a profound impact on the status of the patients and design of the current study.  
 
DSMB Reports  
Monitoring for Safety  
The primary charge of the DSMB is to monitor the study for patient safety. Formal DSMB safety reviews will occur as 
specified above (see Study Review Criteria/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_392286]).   
 Monitoring for Efficacy  
The DSMB will monitor efficacy outcomes to determine relative risk/benefit, futility, or for early termination due to 
overwhelming efficacy.  Interim analyses efficacy reports sent to the DSMB will occur as specified above (see Study 
Review Criteria/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_392286]).  
 
Monitoring for Study Conduct  
The DSMB will review data related to study conduct. Data to be reviewed and listed in the DSMB reports includes: enrollment rates over time, time from last patient enrolled to date of report (indication of delay between treatment or 
follow -up and reporting), summary of protocol violations, and completeness of treatment and follow -up visit data.  
 
Data Flow for Adverse Events  
The DSMB will carefully monitor adverse events periodically throughout the duration of the study. This process will be dynamic to include quarterly reviews of all reported SAEs by [CONTACT_856422]. The investigators will be expected to 
report Serious A dverse Events (SAEs) to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_1192383] recent data (recog nizing limitations thereof) available at the time of the analysis. Requests for additional data by [CONTACT_856423], who will be responsible for communicating the request with the PI.  
 
The DSMB wi ll review the data and discuss the analyses during the closed portion of the scheduled meeting.  
 
DSMB Communication of Findings and Recommendations  
Following each meeting and within 7 days of the meeting, the chairperson will send findings and recommendations of the 
DSMB in writing to the PI.  
 
These findings and recommendations can result from both the open and closed sessions of the DSMB. If these findings 
include serious and potentially consequential recommendations that require immediate action, the chairperson will also 
promptly notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_392287]/or by [CONTACT_6968].  
 
PI’s Response to DSMB Findings and Recommendations  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254]- investigators will review and respond to the DSMB recommendations. The recommendations of the DSMB 
will not be legally binding but require professional consideration by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_840]. If the DSMB recommends continuation 
of the study without modification, no formal response will be required. However, if the recommendations request action, 
such as a recommendation for termination of the study or modification of the protocol, the DSMB will request that the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_392288] a formal written response stating whether the recommendations will be followed and the plan for addressing the issues.  
 It is recognized that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_856328]. Upon receipt, the DSMB will consider the PI [INVESTIGATOR_856329], 
resulting in a final decision. Appropriate caution will be necessary during this process to avoid compromising study 
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017  
 
Page 67 of 86 
 integrity or the ability of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_392291], should the study continue. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_856330], IRB, and investigators within an appropriate time.  
 
In the unlikely event of irreconcilable differences, especially regarding study termination or other substantial study modifications, the DSMB may decide to discontinue monitoring the current study and disband. This decision will be 
communicated to the PI, FDA, and IRBs.  
 
Public disclosure of the PI’s final decision or DSMB recommendations will be at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7516]. 
The DSMB will not make any public announcements either as a group or individually.   
 
DSMB Closeout  
This study may be terminated under a variety of circumstances including, but not limited to, termination for overwhelming effectiveness, futility, or safety issues per protocol or DSMB monitoring guidelines. Responsibilities of the DSMB with 
regard to closeout will be to review the final study report to ensure study integrity. The DSMB may recommend continuing 
action items to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_856331].  
 
Confidentiality  
All data provided to the DSMB and all deliberations of the DSMB will be privileged and confidential. The DSMB will agree to use this information to accomplish the responsibilities of the DSMB and will not use it for other purposes without written 
consent from the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators. No communication of the deliberations or recommendations of the DSMB, 
either written or oral, will occur except as required for the DSMB to fulfill its responsibilities. Individual DSMB members 
must not have direct communication regarding the study outside the DSMB (including, but not limited to the investigators, 
IRB, regulatory agencies, or PI) except as authorized by [CONTACT_4318].  
 
Amendments to the DSMB Charter  
This DSMB charter can be amended as needed during the course of the study. Information to be included as 
amendments will be any modifications or supplements to the reports prepared for the DSMB, as well as amendments to 
other information addressed in this charter. All amendments will be documented with sequential version numbers and 
revision dates, and will be recorded in the minutes of the DSMB meetings. Each revision will be reviewed and agreed upon by [CONTACT_392355] [INVESTIGATOR_40657]. All versions of the charter will be archived in accordance with this document 
and maintained by [CONTACT_978].

        (5)  A copy of the continuing review approval notification by [CONTACT_856424].  For greater than minimal risk research, a copy of the continuing review report approved by [CONTACT_856425].  Please note that the HRPO also conducts random audits at the time of continuing review.  Additional information and documentation may be requested at that time.  
         (6)  The final study report, including any acknowledgement documentation and supporting documents, must be 
submitted to the HRPO when available.  
 
        (7)  The knowledge of any pending compliance inspection/visit by [CONTACT_1622], DHHS Office of Human Research 
Protections (OHRP), or other government agency concerning this research, the issuance of Inspection Reports, FDA 
Form 483, warning letters or actions taken by [CONTACT_856426], must be promptly reported to the HRPO.   
 Please Note: The [LOCATION_003]MRMC ORP HRPO conducts site visits as part of its responsibility for compliance oversight.  Accurate and complete study records must be maintained and made available to representatives of the [LOCATION_003]MRMC as a 
part of their responsibility to protect human subjects in research.  Research records must be stored in a confidential 
manner so as to protect the confidentiality of subject information.

Harmonization Protocol for Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856335]: [ADDRESS_1192386] and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_856336]: Anthony E. Pusateri, PhD  
1. Introduction  
This harmonization protocol describes two phases for harmonizing three clinical studies that examine the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856337].  The primary harmonization plan is effective immediately and harmonizes the 
key study components that are critical to the primary unifying hypotheses and to the preplanned meta -analysis relate d 
to those primary unifying hypotheses.  The secondary harmonization plan will be developed later, and will address 
secondary hypotheses and exploratory analyses.  In this document, the primary harmonization will be described in 
detail.  The approach and components related the secondary harmonization plan will be identified but will not be 
discussed in detail.  
Currently, there is great interest in the potential use of plasma as the initial resuscitation fluid for traumatic hemorrhage.  Traditionally, initia l resuscitation has included fluids such as crystalloids.  Plasma has been used as part of 
transfusion during the in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507427].  Recent evidence suggests both that earlier transfusion and that a 
higher ratio of transfused plasma with respect to red cells improve outcomes.  These findings suggest that earlier use of 
plasma may be beneficial in trauma patients; however, there are little clinical data on the use of plasma in the pre -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84365].  The question of the utility of plasma in t he prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856338].  Therefore, the US DoD has sponsored three clinical trials to s tudy the potential beneficial or negative 
effects of plasma in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].   
The approach taken in the overarching research program was to fund three separate studies, as opposed to funding a 
single very large study for licensure.  This approach was taken because of the limited information available on the 
prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856339].  The approach was designed to provide information on prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856340].  To obtain the maximum amount of information possible, the three clinical studies will be harmonized to provide the most effective possible meta -analysis 
addressing the most important outcomes.  Harmonization is not meant to significantly alter the objectives or success of any individual study.  An additional reason for harmonization is to facilitate  an interface with the NHLBI-DoD Trans -
agency Consortium on Coagulopathy in Trauma (TACTIC).  
2. Purpose of this document  
This document is a Harmonization Protocol.  It identifies the specific points of harmonization among the three separate clinical studi es.  This document also identifies the unifying hypotheses, approach to data integration, and the meta -
analysis plan, as well as relevant coordination procedures.  Specific details about clinical protocol procedures are 
included within each separate study protocol (Appendices 1 -3).  This harmonization protocol does not replace or negate 
any planned analyses described for each individual site, nor does it detract from the unique characteristics of each 
study.  This document describes procedures and analyses that will bring together the three studies with the purpose of 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_856341], harmonized data and by [CONTACT_856427] -analyses according to a pre -planned, statistically valid approach.

 5. Clinical Protocol Harmonization Approach  
This protocol harmonization will be conducted in two stages, Primary Harmonization and Secondary Harmonization.  
Primary Harmonization will be accomplished prior to the start of patient enrollment with the purpose to support the 
unifying hypotheses stated in this document.  This will include such key aspects as experimental treatments and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, among others.  Secondary harmonization will be accomplished lat er and will include specific 
assay methodology and other aspects of the study.  The approach to harmonization will be to attain agreement among 
site principal investigators and then to obtain local IRB, [LOCATION_003]MRMC Human Use Review Office, Secretary of the Army, 
and FDA approval for any required protocol modifications.  Ideally, all changes that require FDA and/or Secretary of the 
Army approval will be accomplished as part of primary harmonization.  It is hoped that items harmonized during 
secondary harmonizati on will require only IRB notification or, at most, IRB concurrence for approval.  
Primary harmonization will include the following aspects of each clinical study:  
1. Experimental Treatment Groups  
2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
3. Timing of blood samples and identification of key parameters and assays  
4. Adverse events  
5. Methods to account for patient transport time  
6. Enabling language and permissions for secondary harmonization.  
Secondary Harmonization will include the following aspects of each clin ical study:  
1. Assay procedures and reagents  
2. Blood sampling and handling procedures  
3. Sample processing and storage procedures  
4. Timing and number of blood samples (additional harmonization beyond that stated for primary harmonization)  
5. Consolidati on of procedures and laboratories to run assays  
1. Experimental Treatment Groups  
Across the three individual studies (Combined Study), the experimental treatment groups will be:  
Control: Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856344]: Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856343] [ADDRESS_1192388] to the specific plasma component and preparation procedures 
to be used (Table 1).  These are dictated by [CONTACT_856429] w ill not be possible to change these 
parameters.  However, we believe that the procedures to be used for each individual study are similar enough to enable the overarching analyses described in the preplanned meta-analysis section.  The volume of blood prod ucts 
administered will be recorded in units  or volume.  Randomization will be accomplished as described in each individual 
site protocol (Appendices1 -3). 
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are compatible among the three individual studies.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
phrased differently among the three individual protocols (Appendices 1 -3).  There are differences in specific wording and 
details of t he inclusion and exclusion criteria as written.  These are summarized in Tables [ADDRESS_1192391] been developed (Tables 4 -5).  We 
believe that these simplified inclusion and exclusion criteria reflect the primary features and intent identified in each 
protocol and describe, for the combined protocol, valid criteria that identify the harmonized patient population for 
purposes of the harmonized analysis and interpretation of the combined studies.  Although there may remain slight differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria, it is expected that the number of enrolled patients that fall outside of the  
simplified, harmonized criteria will be so small as to not appreciably affect the projected power of the planned analyses through exclusion of these patients from the harmonized dataset.  Exclusion would only be required for the primary and secondary unified hypotheses..

 3. Timing of blood samples and identification of key parameters and assays  
Timing of collection of data for key parameters that support the unifying hypotheses will be standardized across studies 
to the following times: 1) Emergency Department arri val (within 1 hour of arrival and prior to in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856345]; 2) 24 hours after ED arrival; and 3) 28-30 days after ED arrival.  This represents the minimum that 
will be performed.  Data will also be collected at other time po ints as described in each individual site protocol. 
Additional assays are included as specified in each site specific protocol (Appendices 1 -3). 
The clinical data both at presentation and throughout hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856346] (Table 6).  Clinical data entered will include a summary of injuries on admission, 
illness during the index admission, medical history, medications, and infectious and non -infectious complications, as well

three studies.  These are the time points that support the unifying hypotheses and primary and secondary outcomes 
identified in the harmonization protocol.  
6. Enabling language and permissions for secondary harmonization.  
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017  
 
Page 80 of 86 
 Each site protocol will include  language that will provide permission to: archive samples, share samples with other 
laboratories, perform additional assays on samples, stor e data, transfer and shar e data, and perform future data 
analyses beyond the scope of the specific approved study a nd specifically delineated procedures.  In addition, a 
maximum blood volume approval will be sought for each individual site protocol to facilitate planning for any future 
additional blood samples that may be included.  For additional blood samples, or for  any other change related to 
secondary harmonization or other reason, appropriate approvals will be sought.  It is anticipated that each of the three studies will be included as the DoD component of the NHLBI/DoD Trans -Agency Research Consortium for Trauma -
Induced Coagulopathy (TACTIC) grant program.  This program will likely require the collection of samples for analysis of 
genetically-related parameters.  Therefore, permissions will be specifically sought for collection of these types of 
samples.  These may include additional consent procedures.  
Secondary Harmonization will include the following aspects of each clinical study:  
1. Selected assay procedures and reagents  
2. Blood sampling and handling procedures  
3. Timing of interim reviews  
4. Sample processing and storage procedures  
5. Timing and number of blood samples (additional harmonization beyond that stated for primary harmonization)  
6. Consolidation of procedures and laboratories to run selected a ssays  
Details for secondary harmonization will be determined later.  
7. Coordinating Procedures  
Communication plan.  Coordination of the three separate studies will be facilitated by [CONTACT_856433], periodic 
site visits by [CONTACT_856434], and twice yearly in-person meetings.  In addition,  procedures will be established to 
report progress and for transfer data.  Additional communications will be established as needed to address specific 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].  Study sites will share full protocols, manuals of operations, and specific details of assays and  other procedures as 
needed to facilitate coordination of studies.  In cases where it is determined that assays or other procedures will be 
standardized among the three study sites, detailed procedures will be exchanged, technicians will be cross -trained, and 
assays (or other procedures) will be validated at each individual site.  
Data consolidation plan.  A specific, detailed data consolidation plan will be developed well in advance of the first interim data analysis that is planned for each study site.  Th e time of the first interim analysis will also be the time of the 
first full test of the consolidated data set and all associated data transfer procedures.  
Study monitoring will be conducted in accordance with [LOCATION_003]MRMC standard procedures for monitoring human use protocols.  This will include periodic site visits by [CONTACT_1750], periodic progress reports, and other communications.  
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) Procedures.  Each individual study site will be responsible for its DSMB.  Reporting will be in accordance with FDA and [LOCATION_003]MRMC requirements.  
Local protocol approvals will be the responsibility of each individual study site.  All study sites will share lessons -learned 
with the overall team.  
Protocol Version 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

Community consultation procedures will be the responsibility of each individual study site.  All study sites will share

Secretary of the  Army Approval.  Each individual site protocol will require approval from the Office of the Secretary of 
the Army.  The approvals will be facilitated by [CONTACT_856435].  Each individual sit e 
protocol will be submitted along with the Combined Study Harmonization Protocol to demonstrate that the studies are 
part of a coordinated program and to facilitate approval.  
8. Data Meta -Analysis P lan 
Unifying Hypotheses  
The following hypotheses will be addressed by [CONTACT_856428] -analysis. 
It is expected that all patients enrolled in the COMBAT and PUPTH studies  will be included in the meta -analyses that 
address the primary and secondary unifying hypotheses.  The PAMPer Study includes five enrolling sites. Two of these sites will have a slightly different prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_23047].  Procedures at these two sites include the possibility of initiat ing 
transfusion of packed red blood cells enroute, prior to ED arrival.  It is an ticipated that for some parameters, this will 
require sub-analysis.  For the purpose of addressing the primary and secondary outcomes,  these sites will be excluded.  Overall sample size projections, with and without PAMPer sites allowing prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856349], are shown 
in Table 7.

Meta -analysis objectives:  
Table 8 shows the various planned primary (P), secondary (S) , and exploratory (E)  outcome measures across the three 
studies. Analysis of ED arrival and 24 hour mortality will provide a more fine -grained  look at the mortality and may 
provide insights into trends in other variables (time dependency, survivor bias, etc.).  In addition, analyses will be performed to support each of the secondary hypotheses (hypotheses 2 -10) described above.

Statistical Analysis Plan  
For all primary and secondary endpoints the null hypothesis that Plasma=Standard of Care (SOC) will be tested against the alternative hypothesis that Plasma<SOC (Plasma> SOC for Clot Strength) using the appropriate independent sample 
test at a significance cutoff of 0.05. For normally distributed continuous variables, or those which can be log transformed 
to normality (e.g. transfusion requirement), a t- test will be used.  For non -normally distributed continuous variables the 
Mann -Whjtney U test will be used.  Binary endpoints (e.g. 30 day mortality) will be tested using the Fisher Exact Test.  
For all secondary endpoints and exploratory subgroup analysis, the significance cutoff will be Bonferroni corrected. If 
warranted by [CONTACT_856436] 3                                                                                                                      January 17, 2017

 significance cutoffs, exploratory Westfall-Young Bootstrap (sampled permutation) minP based p -values an d step -down 
null hypothesis rejection decisions will also be presented.    
Size and power of pooled data analysis:  
Individual participant data (IPD) from the three studies will be pooled for meta -analysis using a one -step approach.  
Potential study specific  clustering effects will be accounted for by [CONTACT_856437] a random effects 
covariate. This constitutes a two level grouped design which will allow covariate analysis and adjustment at the patient 
and study levels. Any study terminated at or a fter the first interim analysis, but before planned completion due to 
adverse events will be included in the meta -analysis.  
Figures 2 provides the power estimates for a range of potential pooled sample sizes for 30 day survival.  An estimated control morta lity of 22% from the PAMPer study was chosen over the slightly less conservative 26% estimate from the 
COMBAT study.  The combined study power curves represent a best case scenario which assumes a negligible effect from covariates and an interclass correla tion (ICC) of 0.  We expect a low ICC based on our high degree of harmonization 
and demonstrated equivalency of primary treatments.  Adjusting for covariates at the patient and study levels will 
reduce their negative impact on grouped power.  The unequal number of patients expected across the three studies will, 
with a non -0 ICC, work to slightly decrease expected power.

curved black line in each plot represents a 30 day control mortality estimate of 22% (PAMPer study).  
Vertical lines represent the expected number o f total patients for the PAMPer (red), COMBAT (blue), 
and PUPTH (green) studies.  Patient estimates for the PAMPer study exclude sites which allow 
administration of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_856350] 1.75 multiplication 
adjustment for grouped design. The black vertical line gives the pooled sum of these patient  values. The 
intersection of the curved and vertical black lines represents the upper limit of meta -analysis power (a) 
and effect size (b). Power calculations use a two tailed  test of proportions differences.   a   b

 Table 9 shows planned subgroup analyses for the three studies. Trauma type (blunt vs. penetrating), head injury, and 
shock are shared across two of the three studies and will be conducted for the primary and secondary meta -analysis 
outcomes. Additionally, any subgroup analysis which shows treatment effects in an individual study will be repeated in 
the meta -analysis if permitted by [CONTACT_856438]. Where differing metrics are planned for a single subgroup (e.g. 
lactate/BE vs. systolic blood pressure + heart rate for shock), the metric used for meta-analysis will be that which is 
present in, and most directly comparable across, the three studies.

Protocol Version [ADDRESS_1192401] use between death and 24hours as “non-ignorable missing data with known mechanism” and use a maximum likelihood modeling approach to impute the 
“missing” portion.  
Intent to treat analysis:  primary and secondary outcome data will be collected in all patients regardless of treatment 
received.  An “intent -to-treat” ap proach will be used for all primary/secondary outcome analyses, i.e., we will compare 
the outcomes of the two groups according to the group assignment at time of randomization, regardless of what treatment participants actually received.  In addition to the “intent to treat” approach, the harmonized combined data will also support exploratory analyses, which may incorporate analysis based on the treatment received including red 
blood cell transfusion .

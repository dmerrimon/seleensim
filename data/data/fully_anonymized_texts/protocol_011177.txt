1.0 Research Introduction  
 
1.1 Purpose/Specific Aims  
This study will test the feasibility and acceptability of a telehealth -delivered treatment designed to help smokers 
with s erious mental illness  to quit using a therapy  approach focused on increasing task persistence.  
A. Objectives  
We will test the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of our PTSC -S intervention  when delivered via 
telehealth.  
B. Hypotheses / Research Question(s)   
1. We hypothesize that  the PTSC -S intervention will be acceptable to participants, and the study 
will be feasible to conduct . 
 
2. As compared to baseline, participants will report greater task persistence as evidenced by 
[CONTACT_166420] (TASQ).   
 
3. As compared to baseline, participants will report smoking fewer cigarettes per day at 1 - and 3 -
month follow -up. 
 
 
 
1.2 Research Significance  (Briefly describe the following in 500 words or less ): 
We created a treatment manual designed to help smokers with serious mental illness  to quit smoking, in part, by 
[CONTACT_166421] (i.e., “task persistence”). While several 
measures of task persistence were not found to be significantly changed in the study, we detected a significant 
change (in the hypothesized direction) on a measure of thoughts likely to dampen task persistence as it relates to. 
Specifically, as hypothesized, scores on the Thoughts About Smoking Questionnaire (TASQ) showed significant 
decreases from baseline to the target quit date, t(16) = 7.753, p < 0.001, and maintained those significant decreases 
from baselin e to end -of-treatment, t(19) = 4.537, p < 0.001.  
 
In addition, we found that the intervention was feasible and understandable. Once we began providing 
transportation to our research participants, attendance exceeded our goal of 65% of participants attendin g at least 
6 of 8 treatment sessions. We also found that in response to the statement, “Overall, this treatment was easy to 
understand,” 68.8% of participants endorsed “7: Totally Agree” with an additional 18.8% endorsing “6: Agree very 
much” for a total o f 87.6% endorsing at least a 6 out of 7. In response to the statement, “Overall, this treatment was 
helpful,” 56.3% of participants endorsed “Totally Agree” with an additional 25% endorsing “Agree very much” for a 
total of 81.3% endorsing at least a 6 of 7 . 
 
1.3 Research Design and Methods  
Overview : We will evaluate the  feasibility and acceptability of our intervention (Persistence Targeted Smoking 
Cessation for Serious Mental Illness; PTSC -S) when delivered via telehealth in a single group, within -subjects design. . 
The purpose of this trial is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of our PTSC -S intervention.  
A. Participant Recruiting and Screening:  The project will take place remotely via telehealth to reduce patient 
burden and travel difficulties. O ur Rutgers offices in New Brunswick, NJ,  are located in the building next to 
a large University Behavioral Health Care outpatient clinic that serves clients with serious and persistent 
mental illness . We will recrui t New Jersey resident smokers from Rutgers University Behavioral Health 
Care, from the community via our website , social media,  and local flyers, via Rutgers listservs , local

agencies or organizations who serve mental health consumers (i.e. CHOICES ; Serv B ehavioral Health 
Systems, Inc. ; George J. Otlowski, Sr. Center for Mental Health Care , Hunterdon Behavioral Health Care ), 
and ElevateU’s  Study Recruitment Platform  (more detailed information listed below under “ElevateU 
Recruitment”) . We will use IRB appr oved language from recruitment advertisements for electronic 
communication (i.e. listservs, newsletters, ect.) with approved study sites. Potential participants will call 
our offices for a telephone pre -screen  or fill out an interest form on Qualtrics that would be followed by a 
telephone pre -screen . If potentially eligible, they will be offered a more in -depth telehealth phone or video 
assisted  screening after providing informed consent. If all inclusion crite ria are met, they will be invited to 
participate. This is an urban area with a large low -income population and therefore a greater proportion 
of smokers than the average of 14.8% in the state of New Jersey.  Previous studies have given us the 
necessary exp erience with Rutgers listservs, websites, Craigslist, and use of flyers and brochures to 
maximize recruitment.  
 
ElevateU . ElevateU  is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_166391]. 
The purpose of the online platform is to match individuals with substance use disorders who wish 
to participate in research with researchers doing relevant substance use resea rch. The recruitment 
platform is currently in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_166392].  
 
Access to ElevateU’s recruitment platform https://moshemu.com/  is provided to researchers at no 
cost. Researchers may register and create an entry describing their research study on the Moshemu 
website for potentially interested individuals to view. ElevateU advertises online, at no cost to the 
research teams for res earch studies. Potential research participants who see the advertisement 
may choose to click on the advertisement link which will take them to a description of the study. If 
interested in that study, the potential research participant can “sign up” to be c ontacted by [CONTACT_166422]/or phone numbers.  
 
ElevateU, as part of this registration process, potential research participants may choose to 
voluntarily provide information related to health behaviors so they can be contact[CONTACT_166423]. Providing this information is voluntary. The 
ElevateU platform is seen as providing minimal risk to participants who wish to enroll in studies 
because the website and registration/data storage process is similar to methods currently being 
used in people’s day to day lives. For example, people typi[INVESTIGATOR_166393], Reddit, and 
online patient communities such as “Patients Like Me,” where they provide information about their 
health either through fr ee text conversations and/or responses to questions. This website will be 
using similar methods and therefore seen as minimal risk to participants.  
 
Furthermore, the primary method of identification will not be through name [CONTACT_166448]. Part icipants have the ability to create a new email address by [CONTACT_40397] a free email 
through tools such as gmail.com. Overall, we believe these methods involve minimal risk and have 
been used in a variety of IRB -approved studies by [CONTACT_2296] (e.g., UCLA and UC Irvine researchers) 
in the past.  
 
All information collected via ElevateU’s platform will be stored in an encrypted database. Two 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_166394] a passkey for each user (participant on the online 
recruitment platform) and for  each study that the user enrolls in. If the user opts into the study, a 
copy of their data becomes encrypted with a passkey of the study. It is therefore will only ever be 
accessible to the user themselves and to the manager of any study they enroll in.

our IRB approved study will only be described in language consistent with already IRB approved 
study flyers. As noted above, potential participants who see the advertisement will have the option 
to click the link on the ad, read about the study, and opt -in to being contact[CONTACT_166424].  
 
When a potential participant actively opts -in to being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], [CONTACT_166452]’s Moshemu account 
will be notified. The research team will then have access to the contact [CONTACT_166425] p otential 
participant chose to provide. [CONTACT_166452]’s team will be able to download a CSV file with the 
contact [CONTACT_166426]. Steinberg will store this file on the secure HIPAA compliant Rutgers 
OneDrive folder.  
 
Study Procedures:  A trained research assistant (who will receive weekly and as -needed supervision 
from the principal investigator) will pre -screen potential participants on the phone, followed by a pre -
baseline tutorial regarding the required technology and assist with any troubleshooting needs.  A 
research assistant will meet with participants via telephone or telehealth video platform, obtain 
informed consent  via a HIPAA compatible survey platform (i.e., Red Cap  or Qualtrics ), and administer 
the baseline assessment battery  (see Assessment Measures table below). We will divide the baseline 
assessment battery into two sessions to minimize participant fatigue if necessary. Each baseline 
assessment session will last approximately 90 minutes.  
 
The research coordinator (who will receive weekly and as -needed supervision from the principal 
investigator) will screen participants at baseline using the SCID -RV for suicide risk exclusion criteria. If 
any participant indicates high levels of depression or suicidality, we will provide phone numbers and a 
recommendation to contact [CONTACT_166427] . In case of imminent suicide risk , a research staff member 
will call A cute Psychiatric Services (APS) at 855 -515-5700 with the research participant and the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_166395].  
 
Questionnaires that are commonly used in tobacco dependence treatment studies will be used in the 
current study. Women of childbearing age will confirm in writing that they are not pregnant or nursing, 
not planning on becoming pregnant in the next three months, and that they are using effective birth 
control  if they are sexually active . Carbon monoxide (CO) levels (also commonly collected in tobacco 
dependence treatment studies) will be assessed with a personal carbon monoxide monitor that 
connects to one’s mobile device and CO reading in parts per million (ppm) will be recorded.  
 
Study  Intervention: We will  provide free, weekly individual telehealth video counseling sessions for 8 
weeks and 10 -weeks’ worth of the nicotine transdermal patch (an FDA -approved smoking cessation 
product available over the counter). All sessions will be video  recorded for treatment integrity and 
supervision.  
 
HIPAA compatible video platform : We will use Microsoft Teams for all assessment and telehealth  
counseling  appointments . If there are any problems connecting to Microsoft Teams, we will use 
Doxy.me or Zoom as a backup. Both Microsoft Teams , Doxy.me , and zoom  are HIPAA compatible 
platforms for telehealth services. A trained research assistant will meet with each participant  via 
Microsoft Teams (or via telephone ) if participant is unable to use the technology without any assistance

beginning of assessment or  counseling.  
 
In the event we are unable to meet with a patient using telehealth  video services (e.g. because of 
internet connectivity issues ), we will provide counseling using the telephone . There is a strong 
literature supporting tobacco "QuitLines", proactive telephone coun seling and we would therefore still 
be providing treatment via an empi[INVESTIGATOR_166396]. We expect this will in the best interest of

Emails : We may  create a Google account  email with a complex password for each research participant 
using their assigned ID number and short title of our study “ptscs”  (i.e. ID#[EMAIL_3357] ) if a 
participant does not have an email address to use . We will store this information using the HIPAA 
compliant Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage system  and may assist participants with their email as 
needed . No PH I will be transmitted via this email account. This email will be used to set up  the 
Smokerlyzer application for the iCO Smokerlyzer device, as the application requires an email to be sent 
to our research team with  the results of their breath test. We will ask our participants to not use this 
email account for communication outside of the research study to protect their confidentiality.  See 
section 1.7.2 for more on the iCO Smokerlyzer device.  
 
B. Data Points:  We will collect data at baseline, at the end of treatment, and at follow up at [ADDRESS_193077] 
quit date.  
 
C. Duration:  Participants will be active in the stud y for approximately [ADDRESS_193078] an interim 
analysis after 50% of the target enrollment has completed followup assessment.  
 
1.4 Preliminary Data  
Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (N=26) examining the PTSC -S intervention demonstrated that we could successfully follow -up this 
population (20 of 26 participants were reached at end -of-treatment). In addition, we demonstrated tha t our 
intervention engaged our target mechanism (i.e., task persistence). While there was no change in persistence on 
multiple measures, we did find that as hypothesized, scores on the Thoughts About Smoking Questionnaire (TASQ) 
showed significant decrease s from baseline to the target quit date, t(16) = 7.753, p < 0.001, and maintained those 
significant decreases from baseline to end -of-treatment, t(19) = 4.537, p < 0.001. These data indicate that our PTSC -
S intervention positively influenced cognitive aspe cts of our target mechanism, thus meeting milestone 1. More 
specifically, our intervention was able to positively influence cognitions likely to dampen task persistence.  
 
We also found that 57.7% of participants met our target of attending at least [ADDRESS_193079] 5 patients from the equation (those 
who did not have the benefit of transportation provided to them), we find that 66.7% of participants attended at 
least 6 of 8 of their PTSC -S treatment sessions.  
 
Finally, participants found the intervention to be easy to understand and helpful. In response to the statement, 
“Overall, this treatment was easy to understand,” 68.8% of participants endorsed “7: Totally Agree” with an 
additio nal 18.8% endorsing “6: Agree very much” for a total of 87.6% endorsing at least a 6 out of 7In response to

the statement, “Overall, this treatment was helpful,” 56.3% of participants endorsed “Totally Agree” with an 
additional  25% endorsing “Agree very m uch” for a total of  81.3% endorsing at least a [ADDRESS_193080] (Cohen’s dz  = 1.28) of the intervention 
on task persistence as measured by [CONTACT_166428] (TASQ). We detected a change in 
mean(SD) scores, in the predicted direction, from 4.371(1.0) at baseline to 3.218(1.1) at follow -up. An effect of dz = 
1.28 setting power at 80% and alpha at 0.05 suggests we need N = [ADDRESS_193081] (see Figure 1 below).  
Because effect sizes may be unstable at smaller sample sizes, we will be much more conservative and as sume an 
effect size of Cohen’s dz = 0.5 (consistent with a medium, rather than a very large effect size). Given a medium effect 
size, while setting power at 80% and alpha at 0.05, we will require N = 27 participants for this within -subjects design 
(see Fig ure 2 below). While we will impute baseline data where follow -up data are missing (i.e., assuming no 
improvement), we will also recruit additional participants to account for the possibility of up to 20% loss to follow -
up (i.e., 80% retention rate). We wil l therefore aim to recruit [ADDRESS_193082] N = 27 with complete 
data at follow -up after making the protocol changes described within this document . 
 
1.6 Study Variables  
A. Independent Variables, Interventions, or Predictor Variables  
We will provide 8 -weeks of free telehealth counseling to participants and 10 weeks of nicotine transdermal 
patch (an FDA -approved, over -the-counter medication).  
 
“Persistence -Targeted Smoking Cessation  in those with Serious Mental Illness  (PTSC -S)” is an 8-session, 
individual, smoking cessation counseling strategy that focuses heavily on using cognitive behavioral therapy 
targeted at disputing automatic thoughts that may reduce task persistence for smokers with serious mental 
illness . While disputing autom atic thoughts will be the focus of each session, skill building and support will 
also be included. Participants will be asked to complete homework assignments between sessions – 
including keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a daily thought record to monitor automatic thoughts that ma y put them at risk for 
smoking. A daily thought record is a commonly used cognitive behavioral therapy homework assignment in 
which participants practice identifying and evaluating their thoughts. Participants will also track their daily 
cigarette use and nicotine patch use for homework.  
 
 
We will give participants a 10 -week supply of the nicotine transdermal patch (an FDA -approved, over -the-
counter medication) to be used starting two weeks prior to their Quit Date.  Although the nicotine patch 
is commercial ly available without a doctor’s prescription, Co -I [CONTACT_166453] (an addiction 
psychiatrist) will provide medical monitoring during this study. Consistent with the product insert, 
participants will be instructed to use one nicotine patch daily, and to apply it upon awakening at 
about the same time each day. Subjects will be instructed to vary the site of application of the 
patch daily to minimize any skin irritation. They will use the 21mg patch for the first 8 -weeks, then 
2-weeks of the 14mg patch.  
 
B. Dependent Variables or Outcome Measures   
Primary Outcome measures

• We will measure feasibility using a  scale regarding how “useful” the intervention was, how 
acceptable the length of each session was, and how acceptable the number of counseling sessions 
offered was (with higher scores reflecting ratings of more useful and more acceptable).   
• Follow -up rate s of at least 80% at the 3 -month follow -up 
• Rates of missing/unusable data will be < 10% of all data collected  
Secondary Outcome measures:  
• 7-day point prevalence abstinence at end -of-treatment and [ADDRESS_193084] quit -date  
• Percent abstinence days between the target quit -date and end -of-treatment and [ADDRESS_193085] 
quit-date.  
• Task Persistence  
• Treatment attendance  
 
 
1.7 Drugs/Devices/Biologics  
1) Nicotine replacement therapy . The n icotine transdermal patch is an accepted , FDA approved  treatment for 
nicotine dependence . Nicotine patches are available over -the-counter (OTC)  without a prescription . Study 
participants will be provided with information by a research therapi[INVESTIGATOR_166398], including a desc ription of common side effects.  
 
A. Drug Accountability and Storage Methods  
▪ Storage and accountability.  We will store  any existing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in 
original packaging (box containing 2 -week supply) in locked cabinets in a room with locked doors 
at [ADDRESS_193086]; Suite 105; New Brunswick, NJ. We will  document temperature of the room 
weekly using a min/max thermometer.  All future NRT orders will be directly shipped to 
participants.  
o Back Up Storage Site : In the event the storage room reaches a temperature near the 
maximum or minimum allowed temperature range, we will temporarily store  the 
medication at the Rutgers RWJMS Research Pharmacy located in the East Tower, 8th 
Floor, [ADDRESS_193087] the pharmacy and 
arrange to drop off /pi[INVESTIGATOR_166399] . We will document the transfer i n the in the 
medication  log. The research assistant will document their name, the date of the 
transfer, and the number of boxes  transferred.   
 
If the medication is stored at the pharmacy and the research therapi[INVESTIGATOR_166400] a research participant , the research therapi[INVESTIGATOR_166401] a research assistant to pi[INVESTIGATOR_166402].  
▪ Inventory.  A trained research assistant  will use an NRT inventory log to document the Lot # and 
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_166403].  After receiving the nicotine patch shipm ent, a research 
assistant will meet with the participant using telehealth video platform, asking the patient to 
show each  nicotine box’s  expi[INVESTIGATOR_166404] . This information will be documented 
in the inventory log.

▪ Dispensing NRT.  We will purchase the [ADDRESS_193088] udy. After receiving the nicotine patch shipment, a research 
assistant will meet with the participant using telehealth video platform, asking the patient to 
show each  nicotine box’s  expi[INVESTIGATOR_166404] . This information will be documented 
in the  dispensing log. The research therapi[INVESTIGATOR_166405]. Consistent  with the product insert, participants will be instruc ted to use one 
nicotine patch daily, and to apply it upon awakening at about the same time each day. 
Participants will be instructed to vary the site of application of the patch daily to minimize any 
skin irritation. They will use the 21mg patch for the fi rst [ADDRESS_193089] unused portions of the NRT because it is not common practice to 
specify a time limit by [CONTACT_166429].  Patients will receive  large 
stickers with the label “21 mg” or “14mg”. A  research assistant will watch patients put the correct 
sticker over the seal of the appropriate nicotine patch box to minimize chances that patients will 
open the wrong box.  
 
2) Carbon Monoxide Monitor.  We will use the  iCO™ Smokerlyzer  to measure carbon monoxide (CO) . The iCO 
Smokerlyzer  has an FDA regulatory classification of a General Wellness Device (GWD)  and therefore does not 
have a 510(k) number . The iCO™ Smokerlyzer® allows you to measure your breath CO levels to encou rage the 
user to make an informed decision about cutting down or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_166406], 
which is in line with the definition and intended use of a General Wellness Device ( GWD ). 
 
The iCO Smokerlyzer  works with iOS or android smartphone or tablet and in conjunction with their 
Smokerlyzer®App (available on Apple App Store & Google Play Store). Each participant will receive an iCO 
Smokerlyzer  and a computer tablet with the app loaded to the device. The iCO Smokerlyzer provides 
biofeedback in the form of a personal CO level immediately from a simple breath test.   
 
The patient is asked to hold their breath for a [ADDRESS_193090], participants will send  our research team the results, which are date and time 
stamped, from an email account we set up for them. The data itself are stored on the participants’ own mobile 
device and the data transmitted  via email will not contain any PHI. For more information about participant’s 
email accounts please reference 1.3.A.  
  
A. Device Accountability and Storage Methods  
▪ Storage and accountability.  We will store  the iCO Smokerlyzer devices  with  the study coordinator  
or Principal Investigator . We will document when each iCO Smokerlyzer devices are provided to 
participants.  
▪ A research assistant will provide instructions on how to use the iCO Smokerlyzer. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_166407] s.

recommendation to contact [CONTACT_166430].  In case of emergent suicidality a research staff member will call Acute Psychiatric 
Services (APS) at 855 -515-5700  with the research participant.  
 
A. Administration  
Participants will meet with a research assistant for a “pre -baseline” appointment technology tutorial for 
assistance with any troubleshooting needs.  Participants will then meet with a research assistant to provide 
electronic informed consent through HIPAA compatible survey platform, RedCap  or Qualtrics . Following 
consent, participants will complete a questionnaire battery that does not include PHI online via Qualtrics .  
▪ Timing and Frequency  
We will divide the baseline assessment battery into two sessions to minimize participant fatigue if 
necessary.  Each baseline assessment session will last approximately [ADDRESS_193092] approximately 
60 min utes.  
▪ Location  
Participants will complete questionnaires and counseling sessions using a HIPAA compatible  
telehealth platform  (e.g. Microsoft Teams , Doxy.me , or zoom ) 
▪ Procedures for Audio and Visual Recording  
Participants will be asked permission to allow study staff to video record their intervention as part 
of the research study, by [CONTACT_166431]. The recording(s) will 
be used for clinical supervision, to validate the integr ity of the counseling intervention, and 
potentially to later examine the relationship between what is said during the sessions and various 
clinical outcomes.  The recording(s) will include the participant ID number and date of the research 
appointment  and will automatically be stored within the Microsoft  Teams environment ( i.e., 
Microsoft  Streams) . If we were forced to use Doxy.me  or zoom  as a backup, recordings would be 
stored on password protected local computers, and the files would  then be encrypte d and moved 
to a HIPAA compatible network storage .  The files themselves will be password protected and 
encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard 256 method (AES -256). Files will be linked with 
each participant’s  ID number. Files will be destroyed 6  years after the protocol is closed.

Demographics Questionnaire . This questionnaire includes primarily items from the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; ([LOCATION_002] Department of Health and Human 
Services & Disease Control and Prevention, 2010) including items about a ge, race, and income.  
 
Smoking History . This questionnaire includes primarily items from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; ([LOCATION_002] Department of Health and Human Services 
& Disease Control and Prevention, 2010) . This self-report asks whether a participant relights 
cigarettes (Yes/No); i f subjects responded “Yes,” a follow -up question was asked to 
determine the number of cigarettes that were  relit (Allen et al., 2019) . 
 
Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD; He atherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerström, 
1991) . The FTCD is a commonly used, 6 -item questionnaire designed to measure dependence upon 
cigarettes.  
 
Brief Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM; Smith et al., 2010).  The Brief 
WISDM is a 37-item, theoretically derived measure of tobacco dependence measuring a variety of 
smoking motives. Respondents rate each item on a scale ranging from ranging from 1 = Not true 
of me at all to 7 = Extremely true of me.  
 
Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale (WSWS; (Welsch et al., 1999).  The WSWS is a 28 -item scale 
developed to contain reliable subscales tappi[INVESTIGATOR_166409]. There are 7 subscales: anger, anxiety, sadness, concentration, sleep, 
hunger, and crav ing. Respondents rate each statement on a scale ranging from 0 (strong disagree) 
to 4 (strongly agree).  
 
ICT – Change Measure (Miller & Johnson, 2008).  This measure asks participants to rate their 
perception of importance of quitting and confidence in quit ting on a 10 -point Likert -type scale 
from 0=Definitely Not to 10 = Definitely.  
 
Quitting Fatigue.  Quitting fatigue will be measured with a single Likert -scale item ranging from 0 
(Not true of me at all) to 10 (Extremely true of me) in response to the state ment, “I am tired of 
trying to quit smoking.”  
 
Commitment to Quitting Smoking Scale (CQSS; Kahler et al., 2007) . The CQSS measures motivation, 
or “commitment” to quitting smoking with eight Likert scale items with response options ranging 
from 1 = strongly  disagree to 5 = strongly agree.  
 
Thoughts About Smoking Questionnaire.  The Thoughts About Smoking Questionnaire is a 1 4-item 
scale that was developed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_166410]. Respondents rate items from 1 -7 (Totally 
Disagree to Totally Agree).  
 
Temperament and Character Inventory —Persistence Scale (TCI -P; Cloninger, Przybeck, Svrakic, & 
Wetzel, 1994). This subscale examines the trait of task persis tence in 8 True/False items.  
 
2-item Task Persistence Measure (Steinberg et al., 2007).  This 2 -item scale measures task 
persistence via a 4 -choice Likert scale (Very True to Very Untrue)

Distress Tolerance Scale  (DTS; Simons & Gaher, 2005) . 15-item scale used to assess 
participants’ perception of their ability to tolerate mental distress. Items (e.g. “I can’t 
handle feeling distressed or upset”) answered on 5 -point Likert -type scales ranging from 
(1) strongly agree to (5) strongly disagree evaluate p articipants’ ability to experience and 
endure negative emotional states and includes scales that assess appraisal, tolerance, 
absorption, and regulation. This scale contains good psychometric properties, including 
high internal consistency.  Because six of these items are included in the DII, below, this 
measure will be comprised of nine items.  
 
Distress Intolerance Scale  (DIS; Schmidt, 2006 ). 5-item measure on which participants indicate, on 
a 7-point Likert -type scale (0 = not at all like me to 6 = extremely like me), the degree of agreement 
towards statements related to their tolerance of discomfort  
 
COVID -19 Questionnaire . This questionnaire includes q uestions from the Coronavirus Stressor 
Survey ( McLean & Cloitre, 2020 ) and relationship between th e coronavirus and smoking.  
 
Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1983).  The BSI is  a self -report instrument 
assessing severity of psychiatric symptoms.  
 
Breath -holding.  We will document time in seconds that participants can hold their br eath as a 
measure of task persistence. Participants will raise their hand when the experience begins to 
become uncomfortable and the total persistence score will be the time (in seconds) bewteen when 
they indicate discomfort and when they release their bre ath. 
 
Medical History Form.  We developed this form to collect brief medical information to assist in 
confirming eligibility for this study.  
 
Inclusion Exclusion Criteria Form. We developed this form to confirm eligibility for this study.  Part 
one includes criteria from the initial phone screen. Part two includes risk assessment information 
from the baseline assessment.  
 
Technical  Glitches Questionnaire . We developed this form to collect brief feedback about any 
technology issues related t o telehealth.  This brief questionnaire is completed by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_11437], rather 
than participants to assess intervention feasibility.  
 
The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI; Buysse , 1989 ). Measure the quality and patterns of 
sleep. It differentiates “poor” fr om “good” sleep by [CONTACT_166433]: subjective sleep 
quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep 
medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The client self -reports each of these 
seven areas of sleep on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale.  
A global sum of “5”or greater indicates a “poor” sleeper.  
 
Post -counseling questionnaire.  We developed this form to collect feedback from participants 
based on their experience with telehealth counseling.  
 
Working Alliance Inventory – Short Revised (WAI -SR; Munder et al., 2010) .  The Working Alliance 
Inventory‐Short Revised (WAI‐SR) is a 12‐item measure for the assessment of the therapeutic 
alliance

Expi[INVESTIGATOR_166408] (CO).  Participants will provide expi[INVESTIGATOR_166411] . CO levels will be documented on this form in parts per million 
(ppm). The iCO Smok erlyzer works with iOS or android smartphone or tablet and in conjunction 
with their Smokerlyzer®App (available on Apple App Store & Google Play Store). Each participant 
will receive an ICO Smokerlyzer and a computer tablet with cellular service with the app loaded to 
the device. The iCO Smokerlyzer provides biofeedback in the form of a personal CO level 
immediately from a simple breath test.  After completing the breath test, participants will email 
our research team the results, which are date an d time stamped, from an email account we set up 
for them. The data itself are stored locally on the mobile device  and the data transmitted via email 
will not contain any PHI.  
 
Pregnancy Form.  Using this form, women will state in writing that they are not pregnant or nursing, 
not planning on becoming pregnant in the next two months, and that they are using effective birth 
control  if sexually active . Although we will request this attestation fro m all female participants, it 
should be noted that the nicotine patch is available over -the-counter, and although the package 
insert states that “the risks to your child from this medicine are not fully known” observational and 
intervention studies do not find harmful effects on the fetus or on the pregnancy as compared to 
placebo in human studies (Bar‐Zeev et al., 2018).   We therefore expect the risks continue to be 
minimal to our female population and are outweighed by [CONTACT_166434].  
 
SCID -RV for DSM 5 - Modules  A, B, C , D, and Suicidal Ideation and Behavior  (First, Williams, Karg,

D. Feasibility of Recruiting  
We anticipate enrolling 3  participants monthly  over the course of 3 years . Based on previous research 
conducted by [CONTACT_166438].  This is an urban area with a large low -
income population and therefore a greater proportion of smokers  than the average of 14.8% in the state 
of New Jersey.  Previous studies have given us the necessary experience with Rutgers listservs, websites, 
Craigslist, and use of flyers and brochures to maximize recruitment.

There is a risk of discomfort associated with nicotine withdrawal for patients who are quitting smoking. The 
nicotine patch (an FDA -approved medication) is well tolerated; however, there are potential side effects 
that may arise  when using the patch. Potential side effects include dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, or redness or swelling at the patch site.  Each patient will discuss these side effects with their 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. If questions arise as a result of the patch, one of the study co -investigators is an Addiction 
Psychiatrist who will be available to provide patients with information regarding their side effects.  
 
The overall risk of AEs in this study is expected to be low because both the counseling sessions  and the use 
of over -the-counter nicotine replacement products are low risk and similar to established treatments to 
help smokers quit. We will monitor patients for AEs at every session, however, and any AEs that are deemed 
to be moderate to severe will be  reviewed by [CONTACT_166440], [CONTACT_69333] and discussed at the 
weekly research meetings. The team will document the recommended actions with input from [CONTACT_69333]. 
AEs will be followed until they resolve or until participant study completion.  Th e AE Tracking Form and AE 
specifics log will also be completed.  
 
There is a risk that participants’ confidentiality could be violated. To reduce the risk of violating 
confidentiality, several steps will be taken. Only IRB approved members of the research t eam will have 
access to the data. All computers used by [CONTACT_166441]. The participants google email account will only include their participant ID number  and we will  
ask that participants do not use this account for communication outside of the research study to protect 
their confidentiality.  Data will only be accessed when coded, entered, or audited. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_166417]. All data will be stored in locked cabinets with in locked rooms. We will 
use a telehealth platform that is HIPAA compatible  (e.g. Microsoft Teams , Doxy.me , or zoom ). Based on 
these procedures, we anticipate that the risk to confidentiality is very low.

6.1 Data Management and Confidentiality  
 
A. Hypothesis 1: The PTSC -S intervention will be acceptable to participants, and the study will be feasible to 
conduct as evidenced by:  
a. At least 80% of participants will provide at least a 5 on a 1 – 7 scale regarding how “useful” the 
intervention was, how acceptable the length of ea ch session was, and how acceptable the number 
of counseling sessions offered was (with higher scores reflecting ratings of more useful and more 
acceptable). Analysis 1a: Descriptive statistics will be reported.  
b. We will achieve follow -up rates of at least 8 0% at the 3 -month follow -up. Analysis 1b: Descriptive 
statistics will be reported.  
c. Rates of missing/unusable data will be < 10% of all data collected. Analysis 1c: Descriptive statistics 
will be reported.  
 
Hypothesis 2: As compared to baseline, participant s will report greater task persistence as evidenced by 
[CONTACT_166420] (TASQ). Analysis 2: One -tailed, paired 
sample t -tests will be used to examine decreases in scores on the TASQ at each timepoint.

Hypothesis 3 : As compared to baseline, participants will report smoking fewer cigarettes per day at 1 - and 
3-month follow -up. Analysis 3: One -tailed, paired sample t -tests will be used to examine decreases in 
cigarettes smoked per day on the TASQ at each timepoint.  
 
B. We determined the sample size based on data from the R21 phase of the study, we can expect a large effect 
(Cohen’s dz = 1.28) of the intervention on task persistence as measured by [CONTACT_166445] (TASQ). We detected a change in mea n(SD) scores, in the predicted direction, from 
4.371(1.0) at baseline to 3.218(1.1) at follow -up. An effect of dz = 1.28 setting power at 80% and alpha at 
0.05 suggests we need N = [ADDRESS_193112] (see Fig ure 1 
below).  
 
Because effect sizes may be unstable at smaller sample sizes, we will be much more conservative and 
assume an effect size of Cohen’s dz = 0.5 (consistent with a medium, rather than a very large effect size). 
Given a medium effect size, while setting power at 80% and alpha at 0.05, we will require N = 27 participants 
for this within -subjects design (see Figure 2 below). While we will impute baseline data where follow -up 
data are missing (i.e., assuming no improvement), we will also recruit additional partici pants to account for 
the possibility of up to 20% loss to follow -up (i.e., 80% retention rate). We will therefore aim to recruit [ADDRESS_193113] N = 27 with complete data at follow -up after making the protocol changes 
described within th is document .  
 
C. Data Handling: Only IRB approved members of the research team will have access to the data. The research 
staff collecting the data will bring the data to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of it being collected. Data will only be 
accessed when coded, entered, or audited. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_166419]. All data 
will be stored in locked cabinets within locked rooms.  
 
Data collection: The data will be collected through telehealth video  interview  using HIPAA compliant 
platform (e.g. Microsoft Teams , Doxy.me , or zoom ). If telehealth video  appointments are unable to be done 
because of internet connectivity , we will conduct telephone interviews.  Data will be stored at the Division 
of Addiction Psych iatry; [ADDRESS_193114]; Suite 105; New Brunswick, NJ [ZIP_CODE].  Only the IRB -approved 
research team will have access to the research data.  
 
Data entry, editing and management, including handling of data collection forms, different versions of data, 
and data  storage and disposition: Data will only be accessed and handled by [CONTACT_166446]. [CONTACT_166452] is ultimately responsible for the receipt and 
transmission of all data. Informed consent collected remo tely will be stored in HIPAA compatible survey 
platform, RedCap. Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_156837] (e.g., names on consent forms) will be stored immediately in Rutgers 
offices where they will be locked in a cabinet housed behind a locked door (of Division of Addiction 
Psychiatry, [ADDRESS_193115], New Brunswick).  
  
All computer files will be kept on computers requiring login and complex passwords for entry, and all files 
with identifying information will have the extra protection of a password to open that i ndividual file.  The 
individual participant’s personal information, including name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_15750], will be kept separate 
from their study data and linked only by a study number assigned by [CONTACT_978]. The master link between the 
study number and patient c ontact information will be destroyed once all data is collected and checked for 
accuracy. The confidential binder containing telephone screen forms will be shredded and properly 
discarded after [ADDRESS_193116] obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH.

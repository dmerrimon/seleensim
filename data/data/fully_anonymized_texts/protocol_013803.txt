Study DesignThe proposed study is a Phase  2, open label study to evaluate the safety,  antiretroviral 
activity and pharmacokinetics  of four infusions of 3BNC117 in HIV-infected individuals 
on combination  ART and during a brief analytical treatment interruption (ATI) (Figure 
1. Study Design). 
Fifteen study participants will receive four intravenous infusions of 3BNC117, 
administered at 30 mg/kg on day 0, week 12, week [ADDRESS_1065539]  3BNC117 infusion (week  24), until 
week 36. 
The ART regimen will be resumed  at week 36 or sooner if plasma HIV-1 RNA  level is ≥ 
200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml, CD4+ T cell count drops < 350 cells/l, and results are confirmed upon 
repeat measurement during the next weekly scheduled visit. If plasma HIV-1 RNA level is 
≥ 1,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml, the participant will be asked to return for a repeat measurement prior  to 
the next scheduled  visit,  and ART  will be resumed if results are confirmed. ART will also 
be resumed early if the participant becomes  pregnant or if otherwise clinically indicated.  If 
ART is resumed before week 27, the fourth 3BNC117 infusion will not be administered.
Participants will be followed weekly during the analytical  treatment  interruption phase for 
safety assessments and for monitoring plasma HIV-1 RNA levels.  Participants may return 
to clinic between scheduled visits for additional  VL measurements, if they desire to do so. 
CD4+ T cell counts will be monitored every 2 weeks during the analytical treatment 
interruption phase. 
If HIV-1 RNA  remains undetectable at week 36, participants  will be offered to continue 
off ART  with close monitoring, in conjunction  with the participant’s primary medical 
provider, as long as HIV-[ADDRESS_1065540]

Objectives -The primary objectives are:
-- Evaluate the effect of four infusions of 3BNC117 at 30 mg/kg in preventing or delaying 
virologic rebound during a  short analytical  treatment interruption. 
-- Evaluate  the safety and tolerability of four intravenous infusions of 3BNC117,  dosed  at 
30 mg/kg, in HIV-infected individuals  with suppressed  viremia on ART and during 
interruption of  ART.
-
-The secondary  objectives are to evaluate  the pharmacokinetics of four intravenous 
infusions of 3BNC117,  dosed at 30 mg/kg in HIV-infected individuals with suppressed 
viremia on ART and  during interruption of ART.
-Exploratory objectives include  an evaluation  of the effects  of 3BNC117 in combination 
with standard ART  on the size of the HIV-1 reservoir.  In addition, a phylogenetic 
comparison of viruses grown from PBMCs collected from participants while on ART to 
rebound viruses collected after ART interruption and analysis of escape mutations that 
might arise after administration of 3BNC117  will be performed. HIV-1-specific  immune 
responses and levels of chronic  inflammation markers following 3BNC117  infusions  will 
also be  evaluated.  
-
OutcomesThe primary  outcomes  are rate of virologic rebound (plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml 
on two separate occasions) at week 36 ([ADDRESS_1065541] ART interruption), time to rebound 
following ART interruption, and frequency of adverse events and laboratory 
abnormalities. 
The secondary endpoints are serum elimination half-life,  and decay kinetics,  as well as 
other PK/PD measurements.

CONFIDENTIAL 11Statistical Methodology
A one-sided  upper confidence interval will be constructed  for the probability of rebound 
using the Clopper-Pearson method. As such, with a sample size of 15 HIV-infected 
individuals, the null hypothesis (p(rebound)=0.85)  will be rejected with at least 80% 
power if at least 6 participants do not rebound  (an effect  size equal or higher than 0.32). 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be used to address the second variable, “time to 
rebound”. If 10 or more participants experience  viral rebound prior to week 29 [[ADDRESS_1065549] 3BNC117 infusion], additional participants 
will not undergo  ATI.
The number and percentage of participants experiencing one or more AEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_775801], and severity. AEs will also be summarized  by 
[CONTACT_775802] v2.0. The CTCAE v4.03 grading scale will be used for reporting and grading  
adverse events related  to infusion  reactions (Appendix B). 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated  using standard non-compartmental analysis 
methods. 
A 95% repeated  measures ANOVA  F-test will be used to compare the levels of latently  
infected resting CD4+  T cells in peripheral blood;  levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA by [CONTACT_558587];  and levels  of cell-associated HIV-1  RNA  and DNA, at baseline and at weeks 
12, 23 (or 24) and 36. For repeated measures ANOVA  F-test, a sample  size of [ADDRESS_1065550]  size of 0.44, with 80% power and 95% 
confidence.

CONFIDENTIAL 142LAY SUMMARY
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_775774] (ART) in suppressing  
viral replication and preventing  disease progression, HIV-[ADDRESS_1065560]  
participants, due to persistence of HIV-1 in latent reservoirs.  3BNC117 is a highly 
neutralizing anti-HIV-1  monoclonal antibody  isolated and cloned from  an HIV-infected  
individual who is a viremic  controller.  In preclinical studies  carried out in humanized 
mice and non-human primates, 3BNC117 alone or in combination with other  neutralizing 
antibodies led to protection  from HIV-1 or chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency 
virus (SHIV) infection, and also to sustained suppression of HIV-1  plasma viremia. 
Moreover, 3BNC117 in combination  with other  bNAbs  and agents that reverse HIV-1  
latency prevented viral rebound in HIV-infected  humanized mice. In humans,  3BNC117  
is being evaluated under protocol MCA-835 and to date has been generally safe. 
Moreover, a single infusion of 3BNC117  transiently  decreases HIV-1 viral loads  in HIV-
infected individuals. The primary aims of this protocol are to evaluate 3BNC117’s effects 
on preventing virologic  rebound when  ART is discontinued and the safety  of four 
intravenous infusions of 3BNC117. In addition, the study will evaluate 3BNC117’s 
effects on established HIV-[ADDRESS_1065561]  achieved virologic 
suppression on ART alone.  
3Objectives and Rationale
3.1Introduction
3.1.1 Background
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_775775], HIV-1 infection  persists in a latent state 
as integrated proviruses  in resting  memory  CD4+ T cells (Eisele E et al. 2012). The 
burden of daily medication regimens, toxicity, development of resistance  and cost 
underscore the need for a continued  search for additional complementary  therapeutic 
modalities. Moreover,  standard antiretroviral  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_775776] a 
normal immune status  in HIV-infected individuals and co-morbidities such as 
cardiovascular disease, bone disorders and cognitive impairment may occur  (Deeks S et 
al. 2013) .  
The latent reservoir  is established very early during infection (Chun TW et al. 1998, 
Archin NM et al. 2012) and it is the major barrier to curing HIV-1 infection.  The HIV-1 
reservoir is maintained during ART by [CONTACT_775803]-life of infected memory T cells, the 
homeostatic proliferation of these cells, and perhaps by [CONTACT_775804]-to-cell virus 
transfer (Barouch  D Deeks S 2014). Although latently infected resting CD4+ T cells are 
largely nonpermissive  for viral gene  expression,  it is believed that even on ART, a 
fraction of infected cells can intermittently produce virus (Bailey J et al. 2006, Tobin N et 
al. 2005).

(Davey RT et al. 1999; Papasavvas E et al. 2004, El-Sadr WM et al. 2006, Rothenberger  
M et al. 2015). Even  in the context of suppressive ART, HIV-1 infection is characterized  
by [CONTACT_775805], and levels of HIV-1 viremia and cell-associated HIV-1 
remain relatively stable  (Palmer  S et al. 2008; Deeks S et al. 2013). Studies have shown 
that intensified antiretroviral  regimens  do not affect low level viremia  and do not result in 
lower levels of HIV-1  persistence  (Markowitz M et al. 2014;  Dinoso  JB et al. 2009;  
McMahon D et al, 2010).
  
A fraction of HIV-infected individuals (10 – 30%)  mount a serologic response that can 
neutralize a broad spectrum of HIV-1 isolates (Simek M et al. 2009). Although  broadly 
neutralizing antibodies that arise  during  HIV infection fail to resolve established 
infection, the selection of resistant strains indicates  that bNAbs  exert selective pressure 
on the virus. Importantly,  several different  groups of investigators have shown that 
macaque chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection can be 
prevented by [CONTACT_775806]-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies 
(Mascola J et al. 1999, Moldt  B et al. 2012, Shingai M et al. 2013). Broadly neutralizing 
antibodies might  also play  a role in the treatment  of HIV-1 infection.
Broadly neutralizing  antibodies  (bNAbs)  differ from other  therapeutic modalities for 
HIV-[ADDRESS_1065563],  they can neutralize the pathogen directly;  second,  they 
have the potential to clear the virus and infected cells through  engagement  of innate  
effector responses; and third, immune complexes produced by [CONTACT_775807]-1. In addition a subset of bNAbs  can inhibit 
cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1  at very low concentrations (Malbec M et al. 2013). 
Experiments in humanized mice  and non-human primates indicate that bNAbs  can lead to 
rapid virological suppression that is sustained for as long as mAb levels are maintained 
above a certain threshold (Klein F et al. 2012, Horwitz T et al. 2013, Shingai M et al. 
2013, Barouch D et al. 2013). 
In SHIV-infected nonhuman primates  3BNC117 induces rapid  viral suppression  as 
monotherapy (Shingai M et al. 2013, Barouch  D et al. 2013). Also, 3BNC117 
monotherapy is able to prevent infection in macaques challenged with SHIV AD8EO  or 
SHIV DH12-V3AD8 more  effectively than the previously described  antibody  VRC01 (Shingai 
et al. 2014). 
While antibody  monotherapy did not control HIV-1 infection  in untreated humanized 
mice (hu-mice), a single neutralizing antibody, i.e. 3BNC117, controlled infection when 
plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were initially suppressed by [CONTACT_108367]. Hu-mice  
that received  ART normally rebounded  immediately after the drugs were terminated, 
whereas a single antibody  was sufficient  to maintain virologic  control after ART 
interruption in 50-86% of the hu-mice,  for as long as antibody concentrations  remained 
therapeutic (Horwitz J et al. 2013). Mice  that escaped  3BNC117 carried resistance 
mutations in the CD4bs  at positions YU2(279-281) or YU2(458/459). In contrast, viruses that 
emerged after immunotherapy was terminated did not contain  antibody  resistance 
mutations and remained  sensitive to neutralization by [CONTACT_775808]. Of interest, cell-

CONFIDENTIAL 16associated HIV-1 DNA levels declined  in plasma and lymphoid  tissue  following therapy 
with bNAbs alone or in combination with conventional ART in non-human  primates or 
hu-mice (Barouch D et al. 2013, Horwitz J et al. 2013 ). Therefore, antibody  monotherapy 
may be sufficient as a maintenance regimen, when combinations of antiretroviral drugs 
and/or antibodies  initially  suppress viremia.  
In addition  to suppressing plasma  viremia, broadly neutralizing  antibodies can also 
interfere with the establishment  of the reservoir  in hu-mice  by [CONTACT_95962]-FcR mediated 
mechanisms. When hu-mice where  administered bNAbs  carrying Fc region  mutations 
that abrogate  Fc-receptor  binding,  bNAbs initially suppressed viremia at the same  rate as 
the unmutated bNAbs,  but more than half of the animals  showed viral rebound  within [ADDRESS_1065564] partially dependent  on Fc-mediated  effector  functions, such as ADCC (Halper-
Stromberg A et al. 2014). 
Experiments in humanized mice  also showed  that bNAbs have effects on established  
HIV-1 viral reservoirs. HIV-1 infected hu-mice  were treated with a tri-mix  of bNAbs in 
combination with one or three agents  that induce viral transcription from latently infected 
cells (vorinostat, I-BET151, and α-CTLA4 mAb). When [ADDRESS_1065565] antibody injection, 57% of mice failed to rebound. 
Moreover, proviral DNA  could not be detected at the terminal time point in the majority 
of mice that did not rebound, whereas  the majority of mice  that did rebound  had 
detectable HIV-1 DNA at the end of follow up. These results show that combination  
therapy with antibodies  and inducers  of viral transcription can significantly alter the 
latent HIV-1 reservoir  in hu-mice (Halper-Stromberg A et al. 2014). Even in the absence  
of latency reversing agents, bNAbs have the potential to eliminate infected cells that 
intermittently produce  viruses despi[INVESTIGATOR_775777]-mediated mechanisms, such as ADCC. 
Therefore, bNAbs  in combination with ART might deplete the reservoir over  time. 
Eliminating the HIV-[ADDRESS_1065566] measurement  of the latent reservoir to evaluate therapeutic  
eradication strategies remains  difficult (Siliciano J et al. 2014). Quantitative viral 
outgrowth assays and PCR-based assays of integrated DNA yield  conflicting results 
(Eriksson G et al. 2013), in part because PCR cannot distinguish between  inactive  and 
permanently disabled  proviruses, while outgrowth assays  underestimate reservoir  size 
(Ho YC et al. 2013). Time to viral rebound  after ART  is discontinued may prove to be a 
useful measurement  to evaluate strategies that aim to decrease the size of the reservoir 
(Siliciano  J et al. 2014). It is possible that data generated in this study  will allow us to 
examine if 3BNC117 potential effects  on the reservoir (measured  by [CONTACT_775809]) 
correlate with delayed time to viral rebound,  particularly if participants  who do not 
experience viral rebound by [CONTACT_5875]  12 remain off ART until 3BNC117 levels are no longer 
detected. 
The SMART randomized  trial demonstrated  that epi[INVESTIGATOR_775778], guided by [CONTACT_775810]4+

CONFIDENTIAL 17opportunistic infections or death  from  any cause, as compared  with continuous ART, 
during a median follow-up time of 16 months (El-Sadr W et al. 2006). While structured 
treatment interruptions (STIs) have traditionally  been avoided given safety concerns, it 
should be noted that, in the first 16 weeks following randomization into the SMART 
study, there  were  no deaths  in either treatment group (continuous ART or epi[INVESTIGATOR_775778]).  
In addition,  the difference in risk of opportunistic diseases  and major  cardiovascular, 
renal, and hepatic  diseases  between the two groups occurred predominantly after 16 
weeks and increased  over time.  Recent  evidence suggests that short analytical treatment 
interruption (ATI; limited  to a maximum  of 16 weeks),  in patients with preserved CD4 
count and virologic  suppression, is safe and is an accepted tool to evaluate new 
therapeutic modalities (Rothenberger  M et al. 2015; Routy JP et al. 2012; Kutzler MA et 
al. 2008 ). Thus, brief ART interruption  can be used to study the role that recently isolated 
anti-HIV-[ADDRESS_1065567] in controlling or  preventing HIV-1 replication.
Passive administration of less potent, earlier  generation anti-HIV-1 bNAbs has been  
evaluated in ART-interruption  settings in humans, but not in combination with ART. In 
these studies, 13-16 antibody infusions were administered intravenously  at doses  ranging 
from 0.5 to 2 g and were generally found to be safe and well-tolerated. One of the 
administered antibodies  (2G12) seemed to delay  viral rebound in some  participants. This 
effect was rather limited, as 2G12 did not neutralize subject’s  viral isolates  with sufficient 
potency (Mehandru S et al. 2007, Trkola A et al. 2005). However both studies found 
some correlation between the baseline sensitivity  of the subject’s virus to 2G12  and delay 
in viral rebound. Therefore,  in this study we will test the sensitivity of the participant’s 
provirus to 3BNC117 at baseline  (day 0) and will correlate  the effects on viral rebound  
and on the HIV-[ADDRESS_1065568] not been  evaluated before in the 
setting of ART-interruption in humans,  it is not known which  serum antibody levels  will 
be required to prevent  viral rebound.  In hu-mice, levels of 3BNC117 decreased to levels  
as low as 0.5 g/ml (10 times the IC50 value for the HIV-1 strain used)  before viral 
rebound occurred during ART-interruption (Horwitz et al., 2013). In the setting  of 
antibody monotherapy  in nonhuman primates,  3BNC117 serum levels above  1-10 g/ml  
(10-100 times the IC50 value for the respective strain) were required  to prevent rebound. 
In this study, an additional infusion of 3BNC117 will be administered 3 weeks into the 
ATI period  in order to maintain  3BNC117 serum levels above  50-100 g/ml, for at least 
6 weeks after ART is discontinued. This will allow us to investigate  the ability of 
3BNC117 to prevent viral rebound  beyond the period of 2-3 weeks, during  which 
rebound usually occurs after ART is discontinued  (Davey RT et al. 1999; Papasavvas E 
et al. 2004, El-Sadr  WM et al. 2006, Rothenberger M  et al. 2015).

Analytical interruption  of ART  is included in this protocol to evaluate  if 3BNC117  alone 
can maintain viral suppression and delay viral rebound. ART will be interrupted for 12

3BNC117 is a broadly neutralizing and highly potent anti-HIV-1 antibody.  3BNC117 
was initially cloned from B cells isolated  from a volunteer infected with HIV-1 clade B, 
who controls his HIV-1  infection without antiretroviral therapy. The initial study was 
conducted under protocol MNU-0628. 3BNC117 targets the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) 
within HIV-1 envelope  gp-120. 3BNC117 showed an average IC80 on a combined group 
of 95 tier 2 viruses of 1.4 g/ml (Scheid  J et al. 2011) when evaluated  by [CONTACT_775811]. 3BNC117 also showed in vivo activity in HIV-1 or SHIV-infected 
humanized mice and non-human primates.  In chronically infected animals, passive 
administration of 3BNC117 alone  or in combination with other  potent  neutralizing 
antibodies suppressed plasma viremia to levels below detection  (Horwitz J et al. 2013; 
Shingai M et al. 2013; Barouch D et al. 2013). Moreover,  the combination of 3BNC117 
with two other bNAbs and latency reversing agents prevented viral rebound in HIV-
infected humanized mice ( Halper-Stromberg A et  al. 2014). 
3BNC117 has been manufactured for clinical use under cGMP by [CONTACT_775797].  
The manufacture of the recombinant human monoclonal 3BNC117 was carried  out by [CONTACT_775812]-free CHO cell culture.  3BNC117 was manufactured as a sterile solution 
intended for parenteral use, in compliance  with Good  Manufacturing Practices (GMP). 
No animal-derived  raw materials were used during the cell culture, purification, and 
formulation of the drug substance. Testing  for adventitious  agents was performed in 
accordance to FDA  Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal 
Antibody Products for Human Use (1997). An ongoing  drug product stability  testing 
program monitors the quality of 3BNC117 over the duration of the clinical dosing period. 
Stability is evaluated in real time at the recommended storage conditions  of 5 ± 3°C as 
well as at  accelerated temperature conditions of 25 ± 2°C /  60 ± 5% RH. 
Clinical Safety of  Other  anti-HIV  Monoclonal Antibodies.
Monoclonal antibodies are a growing part of the therapeutic arsenal. While each mAb 
product has unique  safety issues related to its mechanism of action, the major safety 
concern related  to mAbs  in general  is infusion/hypersensitivity reactions, which are more 
common for mAbs that contain murine elements. 3BNC117 is a fully human recombinant 
form of a naturally existing human mAb. Passive administration of antibodies is

Passive administration of anti-HIV-1 antibodies  has also been evaluated in humans.  HIV 
Immune Globulin  (HIVIG) was in clinical  use in the 1990s before the advent of highly 
effective ART.  HIVIG was also evaluated  in HIV-infected pregnant females  and their 
newborns in a phase III trial to assess whether HIVIG plus single dose nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_775779]-1  transmission. While there was no demonstrable 
difference in treatment efficacy, the study showed that that there were no significant 
differences in mortality or serious AEs between the two arms of the trial (Onyango-

Several monoclonal  antibodies that target HIV-[ADDRESS_1065571] been evaluated in clinical 
studies. For example, 2F5 and 4E10 are IgG1 (kappa) monoclonal antibodies that target  
the membrane-proximal ectodomain of gp41, while 2G12  binds to a carbohydrate moiety 
on the silent face of gp120. These  neutralizing antibodies were evaluated in combination 
in HIV-infected individuals (Armbruster C et al. 2002; Armbruster C et al. 2004). The 
antibodies were  administered intravenously at 0.5 to 1 gm doses; [ADDRESS_1065572] 2G12 was found in two individuals. Another neutralizing antibody  KD-247, 
which targets the V3 loop, was evaluated  in viremic HIV-infected individuals. The 
antibody was administered as 3 weekly infusion administered as doses ranging  from 4 to 
16 mg/kg. KD-247  was well tolerated  at the doses  tested  and showed  some  virologic 
activity at the higher dose levels (Matsushita S et al. 2015). 
Two other studies  included HIV-infected individuals on combination  ART and plasma 
viral levels < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml (Trkola, A et al. 2005), n = 14;  Mehandru M et al. 2007), n

adverse events (SAEs) were recorded. In both studies,  the use of mAbs  was safe and 
generally delayed, but did not prevent, viral rebound. The emergence of resistance to 
2G12, however, demonstrated  that the antibody exerted selective pressure on the 
circulating viral strains. It is important to note that the antibodies used in these  studies 
have far lower potency and breadth than the more recently isolated neutralizing 
antibodies, such as 3BNC117. Moreover, in contrast to 3BNC117,  these antibodies had 
very limited effect in the  treatment of HIV-1 in humanized mice ( Poignard  et al., 1999).

3.1.4 Clinical Experience with  3BNC117
3BNC117 is currently being evaluated  in a phase  1 study in both HIV-uninfected and 
HIV-infected individuals (protocol MCA-835) and in an exploratory phase 2 study in 
HIV-infected subjects (protocol MCA-867). 
In protocol  MCA-835, study participants are administered one or two intravenous 
infusions of 3BNC117  at increasing dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 30 
mg/kg), and are followed for [ADDRESS_1065575] infusion. As of 17 Aug 2015, total of 55 
individuals were  enrolled in the study (22 HIV-uninfected, 19 viremic HIV-infected  and 
14 HIV-infected individuals  on ART). Five subjects (HIV-uninfected) have  received two 
doses of 30 mg/kg, 12 weeks apart. Twenty-two subjects (3 HIV-uninfected and 19 HIV-
infected) have been administered one  dose of 30 mg/kg. 
Overall, 3BNC117 has been generally safe and well-tolerated, mild transient myalgia, 
fatigue and headache  have occurred.  Some  participants reported ophthalmic complaints,  
but a causal relationship with 3BNC117 was not established. To date, no serious  adverse 
events (SAEs) were  reported during study follow up and no dose-limiting toxicities  
(DLT’s) deemed  possibly, probably  or definitely related to 3BNC117 have occurred.  
Preliminary PK data show  that 3BNC117’s half-life  is approximately 17.6 days in HIV-
uninfected and 9.6 days in viremic HIV-infected individuals.  PK data from ART-treated  
participants, with VLs < 20 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml,  who received a single  3BNC117 infusion of 10 
mg/kg show  that 3BNC117’s t 1/2 in this setting is similar to  HIV-uninfected individuals.
In HIV-uninfected individuals, dosed at 30 mg/kg,  3BNC117  levels were  maintained 
around 75 μg/ml  for 3-4 weeks after infusion and around 5 g/ml for [ADDRESS_1065576] and second  10

A transient decline in HIV-1 viremia, of approximately 0.5 log 10, occurred following the 
administration of 3 mg/kg of 3BNC117 to three HIV-infected individuals with detectable 
viremia. Of the 2 individuals off ART receiving the 10 mg/kg dose of antibody,  1 
responded with a 1.36 log 10 decline  in viremia and the other did not respond. The 
individual that did not respond was infected with 3BNC117-resistant virus (IC 50 > 
20µg/ml at baseline). All nine individuals that received the 30mg/kg dose of 3BNC117 
showed rapid decreases  in their viral loads that varied between individuals from  0.8 to 2.5 
log 10. The median  time to reach the nadir in viremia was 7 days, and the mean drop in VL 
was 1.48 log 10 at nadir. Interestingly,  emergence of resistant  viral strains  was variable, 
with some individuals remaining sensitive to 3BNC117 for a period  of 28 days after 
infusion (Caskey, Klein  et al. 2015). Virologic  data will continue to be analyzed under 
protocol MCA-835,  as additional HIV-infected individuals are  enrolled. 
In protocol MCA-867, HIV-infected individuals on suppressive cART  are administered 
two 30 mg/kg intravenous infusions of 3BNC117 at week [ADDRESS_1065578] 3BNC117 infusion. Subjects are followed  weekly  and 
cART is resumed if viral rebound  occurs or CD4+ T cell counts decline to < 350 
cells/mm3. As of [ADDRESS_1065579] reported AEs were  transient,  of grade  1 severity, and 
include headache,  fatigue and myalgia.

The administration of four infusions of 3BNC117 (30 mg/kg) will be safe, well tolerated,  
and will prevent or delay the return  of HIV-[ADDRESS_1065580]  ART might 
be associated with a decrease in the size of the HIV-1 reservoir in ART-treated HIV-

CONFIDENTIAL 23-Evaluate HIV-1 specific T and B cell immune  responses following administration of 
3BNC117, including CD8+ T cell expression  of immune activation markers, such as 
HLA-DR, CD38 and  PD-1, at baseline  and week 24.
4Study Design  
The proposed study is an exploratory Phase 2, open label study to evaluate the safety  and 
antiretroviral activity of four infusions of 3BNC117 in HIV-infected individuals on 
combination ART and during a brief analytical  treatment interruption (Figure 2. Study 
Design).  PK assessments are also included.
After meeting enrollment criteria, fifteen participants with 3BNC117-sensitive  virus will 
be enrolled sequentially and will receive  four intravenous infusions of 3BNC117, 
administered at 30 mg/kg  on day 0, week  12, week [ADDRESS_1065582] this dosing regimen to maintain 3BNC117  serum levels above 50-100  g/ml  for at 
least 6 weeks.  This exceeds the typi[INVESTIGATOR_775781], which ranges 
from 2-3 weeks (Davey RT et al. 1999; Papasavvas E et al. 2004, El-Sadr WM et al. 
2006, Rothenberger M et  al. 2015).
Figure 2. Study Design
 
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have longer elimination half-
lives than other antiretroviral classes. In order to avoid the risk of inadvertent 
monotherapy, which  can select NNRTI resistant strains,  if the participant’s ART regimen  
includes an NNRTI, the NNRTI will be switched to dolutegravir  (an integrase  inhibitor), 
4 weeks prior  to discontinuing  all other antiretroviral drugs. Dolutegravir will be 
provided to  the participants for  that time period.
Participants will be followed weekly  during the analytical treatment interruption (ATI) 
phase of the study for safety assessments  and for monitoring plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. 
Participants may return to clinic  between scheduled visits for additional VL 
measurements, if they desire to do so. CD4+ T cell counts will be measured  every other  
week.

Leukapheresis will be performed for all study participants. The procedure will occur at 
day -14 and week 23 in the RUH inpatient unit. Collected samples will be used for viral 
outgrowth assays  to measure levels of latently  infected resting CD4+ T  cells.
Stat PT/PTT and CBC with differential will be sent prior to the procedure.
6.2.7 Monitoring for cytokine  release associated adverse events and treatment  of 
cytokine release syndrome
Based on previous clinical experience with similar monoclonal antibodies  and with 
3BNC117 (protocol MCA-835), it is unlikely that administration of 3BNC117  will lead 
to cytokine release syndrome. However, a potential side effect of a monoclonal antibody 
can be the stimulation of a massive release  of cellular cytokines,  which can have 
profound effects on blood pressure,  vascular integrity, and myocardial,  lung,  liver, and 
kidney functions. If cytokine release  syndrome  occurs, the volunteer  may need to be 
treated with intravenous fluids, vasopressors,  and high-dose  corticosteroids  and may 
require ventilatory support. 
Study participants  will be closely  monitored for [ADDRESS_1065611] infusion in the RUH 
inpatient unit. Access  to a twenty-four hour on-call physician is available. The RUH 
outpatient and inpatient units and the WCMC Clinical Trial Unit are equipped  with crash 
carts for immediate medical care. Supportive medications, including acetaminophen, 
diphenhydramine and glucocorticoids,  will be available at both clinical sites for use if 
clinically indicated. In case of an emergency,  after stabilization of the volunteer, he/she 
will be transferred  to the neighboring tertiary care center, New  York Presby[CONTACT_124266][INVESTIGATOR_307] (Cornell) for specialized medical care.  
6.2.8 Family Planning  Counseling
During screening and subsequent study visits,  study personnel will counsel volunteers 
about the importance of prevention of pregnancies  and the use of condoms,  as well as 
other effective family planning methods. Condoms will be  provided.
Pregnancy tests will be conducted at follow up visits as outlined in the Time of Events 
Schedule (Appendix A). 
Should pregnancy occur, a pregnant volunteer  will not receive 3BNC117  infusions. If 
pregnancy occurs after any 3BNC117 infusion, a pregnant volunteer will be asked to 
return for follow up every 4-6 weeks until delivery. Should  pregnancy occur, ART will 
not be discontinued or will be resumed  as soon as the study investigators become  aware 
of the pregnancy. Approximately 2-4 weeks after delivery, a pediatrician will examine

8.1Design
The proposed study  is an exploratory phase  2, open label study to evaluate the 
antiretroviral activity and safety of four 3BNC117 infusions in HIV-infected individuals 
on combination antiretroviral therapy and during a brief analytical  treatment interruption.  
The study will also  obtain  additional data on 3BNC117’s effects on the HIV-1  reservoir.  
Study participants will be administered four intravenous infusions of 3BNC117,  
(administered at 30 mg/kg). Antiretroviral therapy will be discontinued [ADDRESS_1065625] screening 50 participants in order to 
achieve 15 evaluable participants. An over-enrollment of 2 participants  will be allowed if 
participants do not complete all four 3BNC117 infusions. Participants that do not receive 
the fourth  infusion because viral rebound  occurred prior to week 27 will not be replaced. 
Additional participants will be enrolled  after study withdrawal is confirmed.
The same ART  regimen will be resumed at week 36 or sooner  if plasma  HIV-1 RNA 
level is ≥ 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml  or CD4+ T cell count drops < 350 cells/l,  during the next 
weekly scheduled visit.  If plasma  HIV-1  RNA level is ≥ 1,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml,  the participant 
will be asked to return for a repeat  measurement prior to the next scheduled visit, and 
ART will be resumed if results are confirmed. ART will also be resumed early if the 
participant becomes  pregnant or if otherwise  clinically indicated. If ART regimen  is 
resumed before  week 27, the fourth 3BNC117  infusion  will not be administered.    
Volunteers will be followed weekly during the analytical treatment interruption phase for 
safety assessments and for monitoring plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. CD4+ T cell counts  
will be monitored every 2 weeks.  (Appendix A).

CONFIDENTIAL 438.2Analysis of Antiretroviral effects, Safety and  Pharmacokinetics
Primary Objective:
1. 3BNC117’s effect on virologic rebound :
A one-sided  upper confidence interval will be constructed for the probability  of rebound 
using the Clopper-Pearson method (Clopper,  C. et al., 1934). Kaplan-Meier estimator will 
be used to address the second variable,  “time to rebound” (Kaplan, E. et al., 1958).
2. Analysis of safety
The number  and percentage of participants experiencing one or more AEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_8792], and severity. AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_775846],  according to system 
organ class (SOC) and preferred term. AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_775847] v2.0 (see 
Appendix B). The CTCAE v4.03 grading scale  will be used for reporting and grading  
adverse events related to infusion reactions and cytokine release syndromes. 
The changes in hematology, chemistry, and other laboratory values will be summarized 
descriptively. Changes will be calculated relative to the values collected at baseline.
Secondary and Exploratory Objectives:
1. Pharmacokinetics: 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using standard non-compartmental  
analysis methods,  using WinNolin software,  version  6.3. Pharmacokinetic parameters,  
including AUC, Cmax, T½, Tmax  and others will be summarized. Pharmacokinetic  
parameters will be examined to correlate  exposure  with safety  and pharmacodynamic 
parameters, and variance  based on population intrinsic factors such as weight and gender 
will be explored. 
2. 3BNC117 effects on the size  of the HIV-1 reservoir:
A 95% repeated measures ANOVA F-test will be used to compare the following  
variables, before each infusion for all participants and at week 36, for participants that do 
not rebound:
levels  of latently infected resting  CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood;
levels  of cell-associated  HIV-1  RNA  and DNA in  PBMCs;  
levels  of plasma HIV-[ADDRESS_1065627]  immune responses :

8.3Sample Size Considerations
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_775791]  a convenient sample size of 15 evaluable 
participants. 
A one-sided  upper confidence interval will be constructed for the probability  of rebound 
using the Clopper-Pearson  method. As such, a sample size of 15 HIV-infected  individuals 
will allow the rejection of the null hypothesis (rate=0.85) with 80% power for an effect 
size equal  or higher  than 0.32, if at least 6 participants do not rebound. The one-sided 
95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals calculated for a varying number of observed 
rebounds are presented in Table  1.

If 10 or more participants experience viral 
rebound prior  to week 29 [[ADDRESS_1065630] 3BNC117 
infusion], additional participants  will not undergo  ATI.
The safety population will include all participants who receive a 3BNC117 infusion.  A 
baseline measurement and at least one laboratory,  vital sign, or other safety-related 
measurement obtained after at least one dose of study treatment  may be required for 
inclusion in the analysis of a specific safety parameter. With sample size of 15, if none  of 
the participants experience  a grade 2 adverse event related to 3BNC117, the 95% upper 
confidence bound  for the rate of adverse events  in the population is 21.8%. 
This study also aims at evaluating possible effects of 3BNC117 on the HIV-1 reservoir. 
A 95% repeated measures ANOVA F-test will be used to compare  levels  of latently 
infected resting CD4+  T cells in peripheral  blood; levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA by [CONTACT_558587]; and levels  of cell-associated  HIV-1  RNA and DNA, at baseline and at weeks

This study requires frequent follow up visits, which can be challenging  to participants.  
The study staff will review the study schedule  in detail with potential participants in 
advance of enrollment  and attempt to facilitate transportation to the clinical  site, if 
needed. Frequent  visits  allow ongoing communication between study investigators and 
participants and can decreased the risk of participants being lost to follow up. Participants 
will be contact[CONTACT_775853] (whichever  is preferred  to the participant) prior to

consult participant’s primary care physician on any changes in treatment, which  can also 
improve participant retention. 
11Potential  Benefits to Participants
It is unlikely that study  participants will benefit from participating in  this study.
12Potential  Risks to Participants 
This study entails  moderate risk to participants since 3BNC117 is an investigational 
new drug with limited  human  safety data.  The study also includes a period of ART 
interruption.  It has been shown that epi[INVESTIGATOR_775794]4+  count decline 
leads to increased risk of opportunistic  infections as compared with continuous ART 
(El-Sadr W et al. 2006, SMART trial).  However, different groups  have  now shown 
that short analytical treatment interruption  is safe (Rothenberger  M et al. 2015;  Routy 
JP et al. 2012). ART will be resumed if plasma HIV-1 RNA levels  increase to ≥ 200 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml and confirmed upon repeated measurement (performed  within [ADDRESS_1065635] measurement).
If the HIV-1 viremia  rebounds after ART is discontinued, absolute CD4+  counts  
might drop. However  participants will be followed very closely  and ART will be 
resumed if CD4+ cell count drops < 350 cells/l and confirmed upon repeat  
measurement.

syndrome, such as fever, rash, swollen glands, headache,  sore throat, nausea, 
vomiting. ART will be resumed  if acute retroviral  syndrome is suspected by [CONTACT_83671].
Resistant viral strains to previous  ART medications might arise  during the analytical  
treatment interruption.  
During the ART-interruption phase  of the study participants may be at increased risk 
of transmitting  HIV-1 to their partners, if they become  viremic,  and of HIV-1

The risk of repeated 3BNC117 infusions is not yet  known.  
While each mAb product has unique  safety  issues related to its mechanism  of action, 
the major safety  concern related to mAbs in general is an infusion/hypersensitivity 
reaction. These types of reactions are more  common for mAbs  that contain  murine  
elements compared to human mAbs, such as 3BNC117. Passive administration of 
anti-HIV-[ADDRESS_1065638] adverse events observed  were  infusion-related events. 
Immunologic symptoms such as listed below are possible with administration of a 
monoclonal antibody  and will be considered adverse events of interest.  Potential 
allergic-type reactions during and immediately  following the administration of 
3BNC117 will  be carefully monitored.

symptoms resolved  without  specific  treatment  and ophthalmologic evaluations 5 
months after 3BNC117 administration  did not show changes from baseline. 
Blood  drawing and phlebotomy can be associated with pain, bruising,  anemia or 
infection at the site of  venipuncture. Rarely, fainting may follow phlebotomy.
The adverse effects 3BNC117 administration  would have in a fetus or unborn child 
are unknown. 
Leukapheresis is a well-tolerated procedure,  which is commonly used for blood  cell 
donations. The risks associated with a leukapheresis are mild pain or discomfort with 
catheter insertion (common) in both arms, temporary numbness of lips or extremities  
(occasionally), ecchymosis, nausea, chills, transient  numbness and infection (rare). 
The best method to obtain  the number of cells needed for this research  is 
leukapheresis.
13Procedures to  minimize  risk
As outlined above, this study will be an exploratory phase 2 trial of 3BNC117  in 
humans. Potential trial volunteers will be informed about the possible  risks  of the 
monoclonal antibody  and that there may be unknown risks. 
Medical records  and routine laboratory data will be handled with HIPAA compliance 
and protected  by [CONTACT_775854], JCAHO-
approved institutions.
With any new medicine or monoclonal  antibody, there  is a possibility of totally 
unexpected side effects. Participants  will be closely monitored for [ADDRESS_1065640] 
infusion in the RUH inpatient unit. The RUH  inpatient unit is equipped for providing 
emergency medical  interventions in the unlikely  event of acute allergic or other 
reactions. In case of an emergency,  after stabilization of the participant, he/she will be 
transferred to the neighboring tertiary care center, New  York  Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(Cornell) for specialized medical care.
Participants will be closely monitored for the development of symptoms of ocular 
disease (such as blurry  vision,  increased  lacrimation, redness, dryness, pain)  and the 
study investigators will perform a directed  exam of the eyes.  If participants develop 
symptoms or signs  of ocular disease,  they will be referred to an ophthalmologist for 
diagnosis and management. These  evaluations will be performed at no cost to the 
participant.
During the treatment interruption phase  of the study, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels  will 
be monitored weekly and CD4+ T cell counts will be monitored  every other week.

T cell count drops < 350 cells/ l, and either result is confirmed upon repeat 
measurement, during  the next weekly scheduled  visit. If plasma HIV-1 RNA  level is 
≥ 1,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml, the participant will be asked to return for a repeat  measurement 
prior to the next scheduled  visit, and ART will be resumed if results are confirmed.

In order to minimize the risk of resistance  to the previous ART regimen, all 
antiretroviral drugs will be stopped simultaneously  and ART will be resumed if 
plasma HIV-1  RNA level  is ≥ 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml and confirmed upon repeat 
measurement. Non-nucleoside reverse  transcriptase inhibitors have longer elimination 
half-lives than other antiretroviral classes.  Therefore, in order to avoid the risk of 
inadvertent monotherapy, which  can select  NNRTI  resistant strains,  if the 
participant’s ART regimen includes an NNRTI, the NNRTI  will be switched  to 
dolutegravir (an integrase inhibitor) 4 weeks prior discontinuing all other  
antiretroviral drugs. Dolutegravir will be provided to the participants  for that time 
period.
 In order  to minimize  the risk of transmitting  HIV-1 to their partners  and of HIV-1  
superinfection from  an HIV-infected partner, participants will be asked to use male  or 
female condoms for the duration  of ART interruption. In the event of a high-risk 
exposure to an HIV-infected partner,  participant  may re-initiate ART as clinically 
indicated by [CONTACT_5657]/her primary care  physician.
Since  the safety profile of 3BNC117  is not fully known and since interruption  of ART 
has been associated  in the past with increased  risk of cardiovascular complications,  
participants with certain co-morbid  conditions (such as coronary  artery disease, 
uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, auto-immune diseases) will be excluded to 
ensure a healthy  population  of participants  are selected.
To minimize  risks associated with phlebotomy, blood drawing  will be performed by 
[CONTACT_190036]. Should discomfort occur, they will provide appropriate  
treatment.
To minimize risks associated with blood drawing, volunteers will be closely 
monitored for signs  and symptoms of anemia.
Female study volunteers of reproductive potential who participate in sexual activity  
that might lead to pregnancy will be advised to use a reliable form  of contraception 
for the duration  of the study. In addition, a pregnancy test will be performed at 
screening, on the day of each drug infusion, and throughout the course  of the study.

regarding the continuation of the trial  (see section 15.1 Safety Monitoring Committee).
Participants will be withdrawn from the study for the reasons listed  in section [IP_ADDRESS] 
Withdrawal from the study (Early Termination) .
15.9 Other Disease  Events 
Adverse events will be followed  until resolved or considered  stable during  each 
scheduled study visit or during unscheduled  study visits if warranted.  If adverse events  
deemed related to the study agents  are not resolved at the time of final study visit, 
participants will be referred for appropriate  medical care until the symptoms resolve or 
the participant’s condition becomes  stable.

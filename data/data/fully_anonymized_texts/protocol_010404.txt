High Dose Dual Therapy vs. Clarithromycin Triple Therapy for Treatment Naive H. pylori Infection in an Urban
 Population: A Prospective, Randomized Clinical Trial
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_655730], it will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_49790], it will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655731] - Gastroenterology
When the application is complete, it will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655732]
H. pylori is the most prevalent chronic bacterial infection affecting humans in the world. H.pylori eradication rates
using clarithromycin triple therapy are decreasing in the [LOCATION_003] due to clarithromycin resistance. High dose dual
therapy, consistent only of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin, is proving to be an effective alternative with
higher eradication rates.
The purpose of our study is to determine if high dose dual therapy is as efficacious as the current standard treatment
 regimen of clarithromycin triple therapy for patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. The study will be a randomized,
 prospective clinical trial which will measure H. pylori eradication rates in patients with treatment naïve infection with
 either clarithromycin triple therapy or high dose dual therapy. This randomized clinical trial is relevant given the rising
 incidence of clarithromycin resistance that is seen in urban populations.
This is a phase [ADDRESS_883003] practice and there is no experimental intervention. The study is simply
 assessing the relative efficacy of two endorsed treatment regimens in our unique patient population.

3. Summary - Background
Objectives
Is utilizing high dose dual therapy in treatment naïve adults diagnosed with H. pylori as effective as clarithromycin
 triple therapy in H. pylori eradication? Based on this information, should high dose dual therapy become a more
 widely utilized initial treatment regimen? We aim to determine if high dose dual therapy has comparable eradication
 rates for H. pylori infection when compared to clarithromycin triple therapy, specifically among our diverse [LOCATION_001]
 City population. We will also assess the demographics among the population enrolled and being treated. We will
 then compare our data to that of recently published data describing the efficacy of high dose dual therapy as first line
 therapy in the management of H. pylori infection. Our main objective is to determine if using high dose dual therapy
 is non-inferior to standard triple therapy. 
Background
Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, the most prevalent chronic bacterial infection in the world, is the leading cause
 of peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue
 (MALT) lymphoma. Its prevalence has been reported to be > 50% globally and roughly 35% within the [LOCATION_002].
 HP is also notably more prevalent amongst African American, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and patients
 of low socioeconomic status. Per American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines, testing for HP should be
 done in patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia under the age of 60 without alarm features, patients with active PUD
 or history of PUD, patients on chronic treatment with NSAID's, and prior gastric malignancies. Although invasive
 testing using endoscopy with biopsy may be warranted in some patients, less invasive methods are available. Both
 the urea breath test (UBT) and the stool antigen assay are widely used, and both have sensitivities and specificities
 averaged at 95%.
Traditionally, HP infections have been empi[INVESTIGATOR_655733] a proton pump
 inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (metronidazole in those with penicillin allergy). Although initially found
 to be efficacious with an eradication rate of 77.5% in 2007, this number has been declining due to rising rates of
 antimicrobial resistance, particularly to clarithromycin. A recent retrospective study published in 2016 by [CONTACT_418516], et
 al. evaluated clarithromycin resistance in the [LOCATION_003] via DNA sequencing and found the resistance rate to be 32.3%.
 Current ACG guidelines advise to avoid clarithromycin triple therapy among populations where clarithromycin
 resistance rates exceed 15% and in patients with prior macrolide exposure.
High dose dual therapy (HDDT), a specific regimen of interest, has become an effective alternative to standard
 triple therapy, especially in areas with clarithromycin-resistance. This two-drug regimen, consistent of only a PPI
 [INVESTIGATOR_655734], is supported as an alternative regimen by [CONTACT_655738]. Its favorable qualities include a much lower bacterial resistance rate to amoxicillin, increased
 function of amoxicillin at an increased intragastric pH, less overall antibiotic exposure, and decreased propagation
 of clarithromycin resistance. Current data pertaining to its efficacy is limited to small population sizes and amongst
 specific populations in Asia and Europe. A recent study by [INVESTIGATOR_114858], et al. in 2015 evaluated the efficacy of HDDT vs.
 clarithromycin triple therapy in Taiwan, and found the eradication rate to be 95.3% vs. 80.7%, respectively.
We propose to conduct a prospective study aimed to determine if high dose dual therapy is as effective at HP
 eradication when compared to clarithromycin triple therapy amongst our diverse urban population in [LOCATION_001] City. 
Primary and Secondary Study Endpoints
Primary Endpoint: Eradication rate of HP infection treated with HDDT vs. clarithromycin triple therapy
Secondary Endpoints: Patient compliance with treatment regimen, patient satisfaction with treatment regimen,
 symptom control (assess improvement in epi[INVESTIGATOR_50684], nausea, vomiting) adverse effects, age, sex, ethnicity, and

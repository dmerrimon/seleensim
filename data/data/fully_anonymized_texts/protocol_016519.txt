 Title Mindfulness -Oriented Recovery Enhancement for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_393098]: A Randomized Controlled Trial  
  
Study  Design  The design  is a parallel  group  superiority  trial. The unit of 
randomization is the individual patient.  
Study  Duration  5 years.  
Trial Sites  University of Utah Health – Community Physicians Group.  
 
Objective  Conduct  a randomized  controlled trial to determine  the efficacy  of a 
Mindfulness -Oriented Recovery Enhancement intervention for opi[INVESTIGATOR_393099].  
 
Number  of Subjects  The target  sample  size is 260 participants  enrolled  (200 + 
oversampling by 30% for attrition) to provide  80% prob ability that a 
two-sided 95% confidence interval will have a margin (half -width) less 
than +/ - .[ADDRESS_493362] deviation for the between -groups difference in 
the study outcomes . 
 Main  Inclusion  
Criteria  Age ≥18 with a chronic pain-related diagnosis, reporting  current pain 
≥3 on a 0 -10 scale, currently taking prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_4976] ≥3 months, 
and surpassed a validated cutpoint for opi[INVESTIGATOR_393100] (COMM).  
 
 
 
Intervention  Mindfulness -Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) is a group 
behavioral intervention that unites mindfulness training, cognitive 
reappraisal, and positive psychological principles into an integrative 
intervention strategy targeting mechanisms of pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724].  
 
Duration  of 
Intervention  8 weeks.  
 
 
Primary  Outcome  The primary  outcome  is opi[INVESTIGATOR_393101],  operationalized  as scores on the COMM and triangulated by 
[CONTACT_393139]. The co -primary 
outcome is chronic pain symptomology, operationalized as pain 
severity and functional interference scores on the Brief Pain 
Inventory (BPI).  
 
  
 
  
 
 
Primary  Analysis  Effects of treatment on the DMI will be analyzed with generalized 
mixed effects models, and effects on the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_393102], adjusting for baseline levels.  
Secondary  
Outcomes  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533], psychological distress, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506].  
 
 
 
Interim Analysis  Interim monitoring  will focus  on patient  accrual,  baseline  comparability  
of treatment  groups,  protocol  adherence,  data completeness  and 
quality,  and safety. No interim outcome analysis is planned.  
 
 
 1. BACKGROUND  
 
Prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_393103]. Though opi[INVESTIGATOR_393104], it may confer with significant health risks, including 
dependence, overdose, and misuse. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_393105] -related 
behaviors such as unauthorized dose escalation or use of prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_393106] -medicate 
negative emotions that exacerbate craving.6 Research on treatments for opi[INVESTIGATOR_393107]; according to a 2015 NIH -AHRQ systematic review of  long-term 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_289045], “no study evaluated the effectiveness of risk mitigation 
strategies for improving outcomes related to overdose, addiction, abuse, or misuse.”[ADDRESS_493363] -related 
stimuli.8 To address this need, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_393108], called Mindfulness -
Oriented Recovery Enhancement  (MORE). MORE integrates training in mindfulness, 
reappraisal, and savoring of natural rewards to enhan ce hedonic regulation and target the risk 
chain at the point where maladaptive emotion -cognition interactions link chronic pain to opi[INVESTIGATOR_5422]. MORE is innovative in that it aims to modify associative learning mechanisms 
dysregulated by [CONTACT_393140][INVESTIGATOR_393109]-down cognitive control to restructure bottom -up reward learning from 
valuation of drug reward to natural reward  – something that no other behavioral intervention 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_393110] n designed to do. Accordingly, this project  funded  by [CONTACT_393141] (NIDA) is a randomized  clinical  trial (RCT)  of MORE to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_393111] -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_393112].   
 
 
2. AIMS  
 
AIM 1. To conduct a RCT of the Mindfulness -Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) 
intervention for co -occurring aberrant drug -related behaviors and chronic pain in primary 
care.  
We will compare the therapeutic impact of MORE and a conventional supportive group (SG) 
psychotherapy  active control condition on clinical outcomes germane to opi[INVESTIGATOR_393113]. Hypotheses : Opi[INVESTIGATOR_393114], as compared to SG 
participants, will evidence decre ased opi[INVESTIGATOR_393115] ( PRIMARY OUTCOMES ), as well 
as reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506], opi[INVESTIGATOR_4952], and psychological distress ( SECONDARY 
OUTCOMES ) from pre - to post -treatment through [ADDRESS_493364] and quantify the degree to which MORE’s impact on opi[INVESTIGATOR_393116] -cognition interactions (top -down 
mechanism).  
Hypotheses : The impact of MORE on opi[INVESTIGATOR_393117] : a) attentional disengagement from  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related cues  (reduced attentional 
bias) ; b) emotion regulation ; and c) cognitive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (e.g., reinterpretation of pain as innocuous 
sensory information ).  
 
AIM [ADDRESS_493365] and quantify the degree to which MORE’s impact on aberrant drug -related 
behaviors  is mediated by [CONTACT_393142]  (bottom -up mechanism).  
 
 Hypotheses : The impact of MORE on aberrant drug -related behaviors  will be mediated by 
[CONTACT_393143], as indicated by a) decreases in psychophysiological indices of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_66148] -reactivity ; b) increases in r esponsiveness to natural reward cues; and c) a shift in the 
relative salience of these cues.   
 
3. STUDY  DESIGN  
 
A two -arm parallel RCT design with an active control group will minimize internal threats to 
validity. Mindfulness -Oriented Recovery Enhancement ( MORE ; n=130) and the Supportive 
Group Psychotherapy control ( SG; n=130) will be equated for time spent  in treatment. 
Assessors will be blind to treatment condition.  Target sample sizes were determined via power 
and precision analyses.  The unit of randomization  is the individual patient.  The co -primary  
outcomes are opi[INVESTIGATOR_393118]. Participants will complete a clinical  
assessment battery at pre - and post -treatment, and at 3-, 6-, and [ADDRESS_493366] -
treatment. P articipants will complete ecologic al momentary assessments ( EMAs ) of symptoms,  
skill practice,  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_393119] [ADDRESS_493367]  up to 3 times/day 
(morning, noon, and night).

 The primary  outcome  is opi[INVESTIGATOR_393122],  operationalized  
as scores on the COMM and triangulated by [CONTACT_393144]. The co -primary outcome is chronic pain symptomology, operationalized as pain 
severity and functional interference scores on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Overall 
success of the intervention will occur if opi[INVESTIGATOR_393123], 
while pain severity does not worsen.  For conservatism, we evaluate all outcomes with two -
sided tests, and the Bonferroni correction to control for multiple compa risons.     
 
Primary outcomes (PRE/POST/FOLLOW -UP). Our pre -specified primary opi[INVESTIGATOR_393124].gov is a validated composite measure - the Drug Misuse Index (DMI).[ADDRESS_493368] to identify patients who misuse opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],12 the DMI uses 3 levels 
of data to triangulate opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]: self -reports on a structured questionnaire (i.e., the COMM); 
clinical assessment  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724] —the Addiction Behaviors Checklist (ABC)13—rated by 
[CONTACT_45914] (i.e., ps ychologists, social workers, and nurses) blinded to treatment assignment; 
and urine toxicology screens. The COMM consists of 17 items rated on a Likert scale (0=never, 
4=very often) regarding how often in the past 30 days patients engaged in opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724] -related 
behaviors (e.g., used opi[INVESTIGATOR_393125]). COMM scores ≥9 and ABC scores 
≥[ADDRESS_493369] 
positive for illicit drugs or a non -prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]. Subje cts with positive COMM scores will be  
given a positive DMI and classified as a misuser. If patients deny engaging in opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724] -
related behavior (COMM scores <9), then positive ratings on both the urine screen and the ABC 
are needed for a positive DMI, because urine screens can be inaccurate due to variable drug 
metabolites, and clinician ratings may unreliable.14,15 Otherwise, subjects will be  given a 
negative DMI. Multiple studie s support the validity of this DMI scoring method.11,16 –18 Chronic 
pain symptoms  (pain severity and functional interference) will be assessed with the Brief Pain 
Inventory (BPI ).19 
 
4.2 Secondary  Outcomes  
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_393126] 2 items “How much do you want to take your opi[INVESTIGATOR_393127]? ” and “How strong of an urge do have to take opi[INVESTIGATOR_393128]?” using 0 -10 Numeric 
Rating Scales (NRS) delivered via EMA. Single item measures of craving have been shown to 
validly predict opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]16 and be sensitive to MORE treatment effects.3 Reduction in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_393129] (TLFB) and triangulated 
by [CONTACT_393145].20 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_393130] -equivalent using standardized equianalgesic conversions. Subjects will also 
document daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_393131]. Psycho logical distress  will be measured with the 
Depression Anxiety Stress Scale -21 (DASS -21), a validated, reliable scale (α=.87 -.94).21  
 
4.3 Tertiary  Outcomes  
 
The tertiary  outcomes  include psychophysiological measures, self -report mediators, and other 
EMA ratings of momentary affective state and momentary pain ratings.  
 
5. RANDOMIZATION  
 
5.1 Method  of Randomization  
 
An electronic random number generator will randomize participants with simple random 
assignment in blocks of varying sizes (2 - 4) to preserve unpredictability of allocation, which 
will be  concealed by [CONTACT_393146].   
 
  
All participants who  met trial eligibility  criteria  were  randomized via simple random 
assignment.   
A computerized random number generator produced the simple random assignment. An 
investigator uninvolved in recruitment, consenting, assessment, or follow -up generated the 
assignment. No  one else from the trial was involved  in the process.  To minimize  the risk of 
selection bias,  the investigator who generated assignments had no contact [CONTACT_393147].  
 
5.[ADDRESS_493370] 
staff blinded to group assignment (which remained concealed throughout the study). To 
maintain blinding, the allocation list was inaccessible to project staff involved in assessment 
or treatment, and before each assessment, participants were  reminded to not reveal anything 
that would disclose their treatment assignment to study staff.  
 
6. SAMPLE SIZE  
 
6.1 Preliminary  Data  
 
Sample size  considerations  are based the effects of MORE versus SG on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] - and pain -
related variables from the PI’s NIDA R03 grant (R03DA032517). The PI’s R03 -funded Stage [ADDRESS_493371] sizes on pain and  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related variables over the course 
of the study (Cohen’s d=.50 - .84). 
 
6.[ADDRESS_493372] detectab le effects for a treatment X time interaction term given 
different sample sizes, assuming a Type I error rate of .05 and varying correlations between 
repeated measures, which ranged from .34 -.56 per outcome in the R03. Cohen26 defined 
f=0.10 and f=0.25 as small and medium effects, respectively. Thus our target N of 260 (N=200 + 
oversampling by 30% for attrition) will allow us to detect small -to-medium effects on continuous 
outcomes.  Based on dichotomous clinical classification of opi[INVESTIGATOR_393132] a from the R03 
(68% improvement for MORE versus 32% for SG), the proposed sample size will offer 
outstanding power (>.99) to detect differences of this magnitude on this outcome. (b) Precision 
of parameter estimation . Our target N will allow model paramete rs to be estimated with a high 
degree of precision. A per group sample size of N=130 provides 80% probability that a two -
sided 95% confidence interval will have a margin (half -width) less than +/ - .[ADDRESS_493373] 
deviation. Thus the proposed sample will provi de precision more than adequate for estimating 
small clinical effects with high confidence. (c) Multivariate models . Generally, structural equation 
power calculations for the full information maximum likelihood sensitivity analyses can be based 
on Root Mea n Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) comparisons of nested models. The 
proposed sample provides, in a realistic testing scenario, greater than 80% power in a [ADDRESS_493374] 
(26 versus 25) of close fit comparing two models with RMSEA of .06 and .05 at α=.05.  These 
calculations are conservative. Maximum likelihood techniques retain all observations at all 
times, and efficiently incorporate correlated observations to yield an Effective Sample Size that 
is quantifiably larger than the number of subjects. With ful ly specified repeated dimensions, the 
anticipated correlations will yield an effective sample size that is 40% larger, or roughly N=360.

Due to COVID -19 and related research restrictions at the University of Utah, recruitment  ended 
on March  31, 2020,  with a total of 250 participants  enrolled (10 participants less than the 
originally anticipated target N).

Opi[INVESTIGATOR_393134] (DMI) is a dichotomous longitudinal 
variable Y, and  we will evaluate treatment impact with a generalized linear mixed model

For the opi[INVESTIGATOR_393135] (Drug Misuse Index; DMI), it is not necessary to adjust for 
baseline differences, as all participants exhibited opi[INVESTIGATOR_393136].   
Our primary interest lies in estimating, for the BPI  [CONTACT_3252]-primary pain outcome j, the adjusted main 
effect, which represents the overall benefit of treatment across all four post-treatment 
measurement points conditional on baseline:

(t>1) a djusted treatment means. The key estimand for binary DMI will be the main effect on the 
additive logit scale over the four post -randomization occasions.  
This estimand is meaningful whether a time -by-treatment arm interaction is present or not, as it 
repre sents the expected overall treatment benefit for individuals randomly selected from the two 
populations.  The null hypothesis of no treatment impact is 
0:0jjH , a single numerator 
degree -of-freedom test, which we evaluate at alpha=.05/3 = .0167 (i.e., Bonferroni adjustment 
for the three primary variables) under restricted maximum likelihood with Kenward -Roger 
denominator degrees of freedom. To control for false discovery in the three primary outcomes, 
we will compare  the unadjusted  p-values against  Bonferroni -adjusted  alpha  =.05/3  = .0167.   
 
The analysis of primary outcomes achieves unbiased estimates of model parameters when 
missingness arises from processes that depend on observed covariates (Missing at Random, or 
MAR).  Maximum likeliho od estimation (MLE) procedures under an intent -to-treat philosophy are 
robust against common patterns of missing data .27,33 MLE is based on all data observations; no 
values are deleted or imputed. In our tables and reporting, we refer to the p -values under the 
standard MAR assumption as p MAR.  There is however no definitive test for the MAR 
assumption.  But we investigate sensitivity to missing data and possible other covariates using 
two other approaches.  We extend the scope of the MAR analysis us ing Full Information (Direct) 
Maximum Likelihood under broader multivariate patterns of missingness, incorporating 
simultaneous longitudinal outcomes and key sociodemographic variables as auxiliary variables 
correlated with the outcome. In simulations, thi s approach often yields performance equal to or 
better than achieved by [CONTACT_393151] .34–[ADDRESS_493377] will be examined under three sensitivity  variations:  
 
a) Replication of the analysis model (1) under simultaneous inclusion of the three primary 
outcomes of drug misuse, pain severity, and pain interference, repeated over post -
randomization assessments, along with respective baseline predictor values.  In thi s multivariate 
analysis, pain severity and pain interference are continuous variables, while drug misuse is 
represented as a dichotomous outcome under a logit link.  All three outcomes are free to 
correlate in the analysis, with the global hypothesis test imposed by [CONTACT_393152] 
0:0jjH for j=1,2,3, a [ADDRESS_493378].   
 
b) Replication of the [ADDRESS_493379] in (a) with the addition of the continuous log -
transformed opi[INVESTIGATOR_393137], and the continuous Distress secondary outcome as 
correlated variables.   
 
c) Replication of (b) with the addition of the demographic predictor variables gender and 
continuous age at baseline.  
 
(d-f) Re -running variations a, b, and c under constrained longi tudinal analysis (CLDA) rather 
than regression adjustment for baseline.  Under CLDA, the baseline means are constrained to 
be equal across arms.  These constraints are straightforward under multivariate modeling. The 
overall benefit contrasts among the pos t-baseline means, conditional on within -outcome 
baseline treatment arm equalities, are equivalent to the difference in areas under the curve for 
the conditional post -baseline mean trajectories.   
 
In the text and tables, we report p -values obtained under M odel C as p MAR+ , to indicate that the 
standard MAR analysis has been supplemented with several auxiliary variables, as described 
above.  
 
Finally, we re -estimated all analyses under a simple selection model37,[ADDRESS_493380] evaluated at alpha=.05 in the multivariate mixed effects model as 
0,joint: , 0j Hj 
 versus 
1, joint:0j H some  for some j. Multivariate contrasts may be 
 
 implemented in the univariate mixed model framework of SAS 9.[ADDRESS_493381] p -values for the univariate tests.  
  
Descriptive analysis of opi[INVESTIGATOR_393138] ≥50% at each time point.   
 
To explore whether the cognitive, affective, and physiological mediators specified in Aims [ADDRESS_493382] structural 
equation path analyses according to established guidelines28 by [CONTACT_393153]: A) ‘a’ path between treatment indicator and change in outcome (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]) from 
pre-treatment to follow -up; B) the ‘b’ path between pre -post treatment change in the mediator 
(e.g., attentional bias) and pre -treatment to follow -up change in the outcome ( e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_5422]); and C) the ‘c’ path between treatment and pre -post treatment change in the mediator 
(e.g., attentional bias). We will test mediation by [CONTACT_393154] a and b paths, with bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]29 used to test the significance of the indirect effect. Our 
team developed a comprehensive analysis of mediation under possible moderation for clinical 
trials,[ADDRESS_493383] levels, 
among variables - this will further guide analyses for Aims 2 a nd 3. Path models will be 
corrected for multiple comparisons. Mediational analyses will be published in a subsequent 
report following publication of the primary trial outcomes.  
 
For EMA, we will use growth curve analysis31 to examine treatment and homework practice 
effects on:  trajectories of  craving (and other tertiary EMA outcomes – e.g., affective state).  The 
basic growth curve model will be specified with fixed effects consisting of continuous time t (in 
days), ca tegorical period p (AM, Noon, or PM reporting) and the categorical between -subjects 
treatment factor ( g = MORE vs. SG).  Random effects will incorporate correlated intercept and 
period -specific trend components, as in standard growth models:

The model allows different trends in the three different reporting periods of the day. The key null

Additional temporal complexity and serial dependence will be considered in polynomial and

relationships will be considered in ALT models tha t include additional cross -lagged and auto -
regressive effects.

TITLE: 
A Multi-Center, Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-
Group Study to Evaluate the Effect of AMR101 on Cardiovascular Health and Mortality in 
Hypertriglyceridemic Patients with Card iovascular Disease or  at High Risk for 
cardiovascular Disease: REDUCE-IT (Reductio n of Cardiovascular Events with EPA – 
Intervention Trial) 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130649]: AMR101 (icosapent ethyl  [ethyl-EPA])  
PHASE: 3b 
INDICATION: 
Treatment with AMR101 to reduce th e risk of cardiovascular events  in patients with clinical 
cardiovascular disease or with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease. 
OBJECTIVES: 
The primary objective  is, in patients at LDL-C goal while on statin therapy, with established 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) or  at high risk for CVD, and  hypertriglyceridemia (fasting 
triglycerides, TG, ≥150 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL), to evaluate the effect of 4 g/day AMR101 
for preventing the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event of the composite endpoint 
that includes: 
• Cardiovascular (CV)  death, 
• Nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), 
• Nonfatal stroke, 
• Coronary revascularization,  
• Unstable angina determ ined to be caused  by [CONTACT_816715]/non-
invasive testing and requiri ng emergent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
[Because of the variability in TG levels, the lower TG qualifying limit is 10% lower than the 
target of 150 mg/dL, i.e., 135 mg/dL.] 
 
The secondary objectives  of this study are the following: 
The key secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of therapy on th e composite of death 
from CV causes, nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization, unstable angi na, nonfatal stroke, or 
peripheral CVD requiring intervention, angi oplasty, by[CONTACT_4897], or aneurysm repair. 
 
Other secondary objectives  : 
• To evaluate the effect of therapy on co mbinations of each of the key secondary 
objective clinical events in additi on to the following clinical events: 
o Cardiac arrhythmia re quiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
o Cardiac arrest 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130650] 2011 Page 4 of 98 o Peripheral CVD requiring interven tion, angioplasty, by[CONTACT_4897], or 
aneurysm repair 
o Total mortality 
 
The tertiary objectives  of this study are the following: 
• Evaluate the effect of therapy on the occu rrence of a second, third, fourth, and fifth 
major cardiovascular event (sam e as the pr imary composite endpoint but for events 
occurring after the first event); 
• To evaluate the effect of therapy on th e primary endpoint in subgroups of patients 
including: 
o Diabetes mellitus 
o Metabolic syndrome as defined by [CONTACT_816716]; 
• To evaluate the effect of therapy on the individual endpoints of new congestive heart 
failure (CHF), on new  CHF as a prim ary cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191], on transient 
ischemic attack, on amputation for vascular disease and on carotid revascularization; 
• Elective coronary revascularization and emergent coronary revascularization;  
• To assess the ef fects regarding lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], lip oproteins and inf lammatory markers 
including triglycerides (TG), to tal chol esterol (TC), low-density  lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C), high- density lipoprotein choles terol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, 
very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), high 
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) a nd high sensitivity troponin (hsTnT), as 
follows: 
o Assessment of the effect of AM R101 on each marker (on-treatment 
change of markers) 
o Assessment of the effect of the baseline value of each marker on 
treatment effects (baseline effect on outcomes) 
o To evaluate the effect of therapy for preventing clinical events, as 
defined above, among all patients in the study, and in subgroups such as 
patients with diabetes mellitus and pa tients with substantial on-treatment 
changes of any of the markers (on-treatment effect on outcomes). 
• To evaluate the effect of therapy on new onset diabetes (See appendix C); 
• To explore the effect of AMR101 on  weight and waist circumference.

Secondary endpoints : 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is: 
• The composite of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization, 
unstable angina, nonfatal stroke, or pe ripheral CVD requiring intervention, 
angioplasty, by[CONTACT_4897], or aneurysm repair. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints are as fo llows (to be tested in said order): 
• The composite of total mortality, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke; 
• The composite of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization,

For the secondary endpoints that count a single event, the first occurrence of this type of 
event will be counted in each patient. For s econdary endpoints that are composites of two or 
more types of events, the first occurrence of any of the event t ypes included in  the composite 
will be counted in each patient. 
 
Tertiary endpoints:  
• The second, third, fourth, and fifth majo r CV event of the primary composite 
endpoint. The type of (nonfatal) events may occur in any order. 
• Primary endpoint in subset of patients with diabetes mellitus;

will be counted in each patient. For tertiary endpoints that are composites of two or more 
types of events, the first occurrence of any of the event types included in the composite will 
be counted in each patient (except when stated  otherwise, for the second, third, fourth, and 
fifth major CV event). 
 
POPULATION: Inclusion Criteria
: 
1. Fasting TG levels of ≥135 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL. The target for the lower end of the 
fasting TG level is ≥150 mg/dL but because of the variab ility in TG levels, patients will 
qualify for enrolment within 10% of this limit (i.e., ≥135 mg/dL). 
2. On stable therapy with a statin  (with or without ezetimibe), for at least 4 weeks prior to 
the LDL-C/TG baseline qualifying measurements for randomization, to maintain          
LDL-C >40 mg/dL and ≤100 mg/dL  
• Stable therapy is defined as the same daily  dose of the same statin for at least 28 
days before the lipid qualification measurem ents (TG and LDL-C) and, if applicable, 
the same daily dose of ezetimibe for at le ast 28 days before the lipid qualification 
measurements (TG and LDL-C). Patients who have their statin therapy or use of 
ezetimibe initiated at Visit 1, or have thei r statin, statin dose and/or ezetimibe dose 
changed at Visit 1, will need to go through a stabilization period of at least 28 days 
since initiation/change and have their qua lifying lipid measurements measured (TG 
and LDL-C) after the washout  period (at Visit 1.1).  
• Statins may be administered with or without ezetimibe.   
NOTE: If patients qualify at the first qualific ation visit (Visit 1) fo r TG and LDL-C, and 
meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, th ey may be randomized at Visit 2. If patients 
do not qualify at the first qualifying visit (Visit  1), a second re-qualifyi ng visit (Visit 1.1) 
is allowed. For some patients, because they ne ed to stabilize medications and/or need to 
washout medications, the second re-qualifying vi sit (Visit 1.1) will be needed after the 
stabilization/washout period.

Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130665] 2011 Page 11 of 98 STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: 
This is a multi-center, multi-national, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study.  This is an event-driven trial:  It is expected that a minimu m of [ADDRESS_1130666] occurred.  
Screening Period:
 
During the screening period, patients will be evaluated for inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Patients will be eligible for randomization if th ey meet all the inclus ion/exclusion criteria. 
Prospectively, eligible patients with documen ted CVD or diabetes (with at least one 
additional risk factor for CVD) will undergo screen ing to establish suitability for inclusion in 
the trial. The qualifying lipid determination at Vis it [ADDRESS_1130667] 
a fasting TG level ≥135 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL in order to enter the treatment/follow-up 
period of the trial (and they need to meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria). These 
patients will be randomized at Vi sit 2, which will occur soon af ter Visit 2 (there will be no 
Visit 1.1 for these patients). 
Patients who do not qualify at Visit 1, may return to the Research Site for a second qualifying 
visit (Visit 1.1) at which time procedures that caused failure of eligibility at Visit [ADDRESS_1130668] Visit 1.1 to 
determine whether they qualify based on lip id level requirements (TG and LDL-C) 
determined at Visit 1. Other procedures that cause d failure of eligibility at Visit 1 will also be 
repeated at Visit 1.1. Details are listed in the main section of the protocol. 
 
Treatment/Follow-Up Period:  
At Visit 2 (Day 0), eligible patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to one of the following 
treatment groups: 
• AMR101 4 g daily, or 
• Placebo. 
Stratification will be by [CONTACT_816718] (estab lished CVD or the presence of diabetes with 
≥1 risk factor for CVD), use of ezetimibe and by [CONTACT_101820] (Westernized, Eastern 
European, and Asia Pacific countries). 
 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130669] 2011 Page 12 of 98 During the treatment/follow-up pe riod, patients will return to th e Research Site at regular 
intervals for efficacy and safety evaluations , and drug supply and compliance checks. The 
visits after the randomization visit (Visit 2; Da y 0) are at approximately after 6 months for 
Visit 3, and then every year thereafter. 
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUT E OF ADMINISTRATION: 
Eligible patients will be random ly assigned at Visit 2 to receive orally AMR101 4 g daily or 
matching placebo. AMR101 is provided in 1000 mg  liquid-filled, oblong, gelatin capsules. 
The matching placebo capsule is filled with lig ht liquid paraffin and contains 0 mg of 
AMR101. AMR101 capsules are to be taken with f ood (i.e. with or at the end of a meal). 
 
During the treatment period, the daily dose of study drug is 4 capsules per day taken as two 
capsule taken on two occasions per da y (2 capsule given twice daily). 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: 
• Intent-to-treat analysis. 
• Parameters will be su mmarized using m ea n, standard d eviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, and interquartile range for contin uous data an d percentage for catego rical 
data. 
• Survival analysis using the log-rank test for the primary efficacy outcome comparing the 
2 treatment groups (AMR101 and Placebo ) and including the strati fication factors CV 
risk category, use of e zetimibe and by [CONTACT_816719] ( Westernized, Eastern 
European, and Asia Pacific countries). 
• All statistical analyses for the efficacy and safety outcomes will be performed at the 5% significance level using 2-sided tests unless otherwise noted. 
• One interim analysis is planned when approxi mately 60% of the planned total number of 
events has occurred. 
 
The analysis is planned to: 
• Describe at base line: Patient characteristics, including lipi[INVESTIGATOR_816574], stroke history, cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome, among 
others. 
• Compare the primary, secondary, and tertiary endpoints between treatm ent groups at the corresponding follow-up time points. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130670] 2011 Page 13 of 98 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: 
Sample size estimation is based on the assumption that the primary composite endpoint (time 
from randomization to the first occurrence of  CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, 
coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916]) would be relatively 
reduced by 15%, from an event rate by 4 years of 23.6% in the placebo group to 20.5% in the AMR101 group. It is expected that a minimum of [ADDRESS_1130671] this difference at 4.76% significan ce level (decreased from 5.00% because of one 
interim analysis) and with 90% power, assu ming an 18-month enrollment period and a 
median follow-up of 4 years. The current samp le size calculation is based on an estimated 
placebo yearly event rate of 5.9% (23.6% over 4 y ears). To protect agains t the possibility that 
the actual placebo event rate is lower than estimated, an extra 1000 patients will be enrolled 
(approximately 7990 patients in tota l). By [CONTACT_816720] 1000 pa tients, the event rate in the 
placebo group could be 5.2% per year (20.8% over 4 years) without having to modify the 
other sample size assumptions. Before completing the enrollment phase of the trial, the actual 
event rate based on pooled, blinded accumulation of primary efficacy endpoint events will be 
calculated and may be used to in crease the sample size. If the sample size is increased, the 
enrollment phase will be extended to allo w enrollment of the additional patients.

AMR101 (icosapent ethyl [ethyl-EPA]) is a hi ghly purified ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic 
acid (EPA) derived from fish oil, and is bei ng developed by [INVESTIGATOR_816571]. (hereafter 
referred to as Amarin or the Sponsor) for the treatment of hypertrigly ceridemia. The purpose 
of this study is to evaluate  whether the triglyce ride-lowering drug AMR101, combined with a 
statin therapy, will be superior to the statin  therapy alone, when used as a prevention in 
reducing long-term clinical events in patient s with mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816575] (CV) events. 
1.1. Background 
Since the initial observation of a link between fish oil consump tion and the reduced incidence 
of coronary heart disease in the Eskimos of  Greenland (Bang 1972), a large body of evidence 
has accumulated showing that regular intake of omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) exerts 
cardioprotective effects in both primary and secondary coronary heart disease prevention 
(Harris 2008, Lee 2008 ). Several mechanisms ha ve been proposed to account for these 
beneficial effects, including the reduction of tr iglycerides (TG), suppression of cardiac 
arrhythmias, decreased platelet aggregati on, improved plaque composition and stabilization, 
and hemodynamic changes. This mounting body of evidence has led the American Heart 
Association (AHA) to recommend the consumption of O3FAs in dietary fish or in capsule 
form at a dose of 1 g/day for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) ( Kris-
Etherton 2002). This recommendation has now been included in American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the long-term 
management of patients with stable angina  and acute coronary syndromes (Antman 2004, 
Fraker 2007, Anderson 2007). 
A large number of studies have also demonstrat ed the triglyceride-low ering effects of O3FAs 
(Harris 1997, Ginsberg 2001). The US FDA has approved a product containing 
approximately 90% esters of the O3FAs EPA and DHA for use at a dose of 4 g/day as an 
adjunct to diet for the treatment of patie nts with very high triglyceride levels ( ≥500 mg/dL) 
(Lovaza
® USPI 2009). The same medicinal product under the name [CONTACT_816949]® (Omacor SPC 
2008) is approved in Europe for the treatment  of endogenous hypertrigl yceridemia at a dose 
of up to 4 grams daily as a supplement to diet when dietary measures al one are insufficient to 
produce an adequate response. Omacor® at a dose of 1 gram daily is also approved in key 
European and certain Asian markets for the se condary prevention of myocardial infarction 
(Post-MI). 
Epadel® capsules, which contain highly purified (>95%) ethyl-EPA, have been marketed by 
[CONTACT_816721] 1991 for the treatment of arterioscler osis obliterans and since 1994 
for the treatment of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (Epade l SPC 2007). The recommended dose is 1.8 g/day 
for arteriosclerosis obliterans and 1.8 to 2.7 g/day for hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. Hypertriglyceridemia 
is a feature of many dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] s and often occurs in person s who are obese and/or have 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus in isolation or as a component of the metabolic syndrome (Jacobson 
2007, Bays 2008). 
Elevation in TG confers dual risks of acute panc reatitis (most marked in patients with severe 
hypertriglyceridemia [TG >1500 mg/dL]) (Yad av 2003) and accelerated atherosclerosis 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130686] 2011 Page 22 of 98 leading to CV events, the latter even after corr ection for other lipid and non-lipid risk factors 
(Jacobson 2007). With this in mind, Amarin is  assessing the potential of AMR101 capsules, 
which contain highly purified icosapent ethyl (et hyl-EPA), for the treatmen t of patients, as an 
adjunct to diet, with very high TG levels ( ≥500 mg/dL) and those with high TG levels (≥ 200 
and <500 mg/dL) despi[INVESTIGATOR_816576]. Amarin-sponsored studies with AMR101 in 
patients with very high TGs (Study AMR-01- 01-0016, the MARINE study) and in patients 
with high TGs on statins (Study AMR-01-01- 0017, the ANCHOR study) are in progress. 
1.2. Summary of Amarin-Sponsored Clinical Studies with AMR101 
To date, Amarin has completed 8 double-bli nd, placebo-controlled clinical trials with 
AMR101 in patients with CNS disorders in cluding Huntington’s disease, depression, 
schizophrenia and age-associated memory im pairment. Males and females were almost 
equally represented. The majority  of patients were Caucasian, but the studies also included, 
among the patients receiving AMR101, 14 Blacks, 6 Asians and 11 patients of another race.  
The patients received 0.5-4 g/day AMR101 or placebo. The duration of the double-blind 
treatment period ranged from [ADDRESS_1130687] 
received AMR101 2 g/day for up to 28 days  in a pharmacokinetic study (LA01.01.0009). In 
these studies, AMR101 was administered in the form of 500-mg soft gelatin capsules, orally with meals as a twice-daily regimen with half of  the daily dose in the morning and half in the 
evening. 
Across all 9 completed Amarin-spo nsored studies (1 in healthy volunteers and 8 in patients), 
a total of 1243 patients were randomized (24 h ealthy volunteers and 12 19 patients with CNS 
disorders). From the 1243 patients, 724 ( 24 healthy patients and 700 patients) were 
randomized to receive AMR101 and 519 to receive placebo. See the  Investigator’s Brochure 
for more information. In 4 of the Amarin-sponsored studies in patients  with CNS disorders, patients who completed 
the double-blind period were roll ed-over into an open-label extension phase and received 1-
2 g/day AMR101 (most received 2 g/day). The tr eatment period in the open-label extensions 
ranged from [ADDRESS_1130688] investigated the effi cacy of AMR101 in lowering triglycerides: 
• Study AMR-01-01-0016 (the MARINE study)  in 229 patients with very high 
triglycerides (>500 mg/dL). 
• Study AMR-01-01-0017 (the ANCHOR study)  in approximately 702 patients 
with mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (high triglycerides: ≥200 to <500 mg/dL) who are taking 
statins 
 
1.3. Study AMR-01-01-0017 (ANCHOR Study) 
The results from the ANCHOR study are particul arly relevant for the dose selection of the 
present study since the ANCHOR study was co nducted in the same patient population. The 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130689] 2011 Page 23 of 98 primary objective in the ANCHOR study was to determine the efficacy of AMR101 2 g daily 
and 4 g daily, compared to placebo, in lowering fasting TG levels in patients with high risk 
for cardiovascular disease (C VD) and fasting TG levels ≥200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_816577] (LDL-C) goal (>40 mg/dL and <100 
mg/dL) on statin therapy. 
After a 6- to 8-week screeni ng period which included diet  and lifestyle stabilization, a 
washout period for excluded non-statin lipid-altering medications (if needed), and a TG 
qualifying period, patients were randomized to one of 3 treatment groups and received study 
medication during a 12-week, double-blind treatment period. Patients had to be treated with 
one of 3 statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin or  rosuvastatin) to reach their LDL-C goal of 100 
mg/dL (+15% allowed for variability) and had to be on a stable dose for a minimum period of [ADDRESS_1130690] qualifying fasting TG levels of ≥200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL based on the 
mean of 2 measurements. During the 12-week double-blind treatment period, patients received orally AMR101 2 g/day, AMR101 4 g/day, or placebo. 
In the ITT population (687 patients), the base line median TG level was 259.0 mg/dL (IQR: 
81.00 mg/dL), 264.8 mg/dL (IQR: 93.00 mg/dL) and 254.0 mg/dL (IQR: 92.50 mg/dL) for 
the patients receiving placebo, AMR101 4 g/da y and AMR101 2 g/day, respectively. At the 
Week 12 endpoint, the median percent change  from baseline TG level was +5.9%, -17.5% 
and-5.6% for the patients receiving placebo, AMR101 4 g/day and AMR101 2 g/day, 
respectively. The median difference betw een AMR101 4 g/day and placebo was -21.5% 
(p<0.0001). The median difference between  AMR101 2 g/day was -10.1% (p=0.0005). 
The TG lowering effect of AMR101 was similar in males and females at the 4 g/day dose. 
Efficacy of AMR101 was similar in diabetics an d non-diabetics, and was similar irrespective 
of the type of statin administered. The higher the potency of the statin regimen, the greater 
the TG reduction in the AMR101 4 g/day group.  The higher the baseline TG tertile, the 
greater the TG reduction for both AMR101 dose groups. 
Key lipoprotein variables were decreased by [CONTACT_162702] R101 even after patients were on stable 
doses of statin therapy, with LDL-C levels at  goal. Compared to placebo, statistically 
significant reductions with AMR101 were  observed for non-HDL-C, Apo B, Lp-PLA
2, 
VLDL-C, TC and VLDL-TG for both dose gr oups. The Apo B placebo-adjusted percent 
change from baseline was reduced by 9.3% in the AMR101 4 g/day group versus the placebo 
group (p<0.0001). The non-inferiority criterion for LDL-C was met at both AMR101 doses, because the pre-
specified upper boundary of the 97.5% confid ence interval (-1.7 and 0.05 for AMR101 4 
g/day and AMR101 2 g/day, respectively) did not  cross the 6% non-inferiority threshold. For 
the AMR101 4 g/day group, LDL-C decreased significantly by 6.2% versus placebo, 
demonstrating superiority over placebo (p=0.0067). 
TC and VLDL-TG decreased significantly re lative to placebo in both AMR101 dose groups, 
and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs CRP) decreased significantly (p=0.0003) by 
0.5 mg/L relative to placebo in the AMR101 4 g/day group. HDL-C was unchanged in the 
groups, but relative to placebo, there were small decreases of -4.5% and -2.2% for the 
AMR101 4 g/day and 2 g/day treat ment groups, respectively. The difference was statistically 
significant for the AMR101 4 g/day gr oup compared to placebo (p=0.0013). 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130691] been exposed to ethyl-EPA from AMR101 capsules. AMR101 
has been well tolerated (with in cidence of adverse events sim ilar to placebo) and there have 
been no major safety concerns. The most co mmonly reported side effects for AMR101 were 
diarrhea, nausea, headache, arthralgia, and sk in rash. See the Investigator’s Brochure for 
more information. 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 trials in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, treatment with AMR101 at 
doses of 2 and 4 g/day was safe and well tole rated with no safety concerns. The types (by 
[CONTACT_11702]) of common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and their incidence in the MARINE and ANCHOR trials, are listed in Table 1.

In a large study with Japanese patients (Japan  EPA Lipid Intervention Study [JELIS]), long-
term administration of 1. 8 g/day ethyl-EPA (Epadel®) was associated with an excellent safety 
and tolerability profile ( Yokoyama 2007). Most AE s attributable to ethyl-EPA were regarded 
as mild. The most common adverse events were gastro-intestinal (nausea, diarrhea, epi[INVESTIGATOR_258713]) or dermatologic (eruption, itching, exanthema, eczema) in nature. 
1.5. Rationale 
Hypothesis 
The hypothesis is that combin ation anti-dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816578] a LDL-C lowering drug 
(statin therapy) with the triglyceride-loweri ng drug AMR101 will be superior to the LDL-C 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130692] shown that elevated  levels of total cholesterol (T C) and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with incr eased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) 
(LaRosa 2003), and therapeutic strategies that le ad to a statistically significant reduction in 
LDL-C lower CHD event rates (Baigent 2005). One potential impediment, limiting further 
reduction in CHD events despi[INVESTIGATOR_816579]-treatmen t LDL-C, is residual elevation in serum TG 
levels (Miller 2000). Indeed, even after adju stment for HDL-C, detailed evaluation of 
population-based prospective studi es has disclosed an indepe ndent effect of TG on CHD 
events (Sarwar 2007). Coupled with the knowle dge that combined hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (i.e., 
elevated LDL-C and TG) promotes CHD to a si gnificantly greater extent than either high 
LDL-C or TG alone ( Manninem 1992), the hypothes is is strong that low on-treatment levels 
of TG when added to low LDL-C would be superior to low LDL-C alone in reducing 
subsequent CHD events. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis was obtained in a post hoc 
analysis of the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Ev aluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In 
Myocardial Infarction 22 Trial (PROVE IT-T IMI 22) (Miller 2008) wh erein among patients 
receiving statin therapy after acute coronary syndrome (ACS ), on treatment TG <150 mg/dL 
was associated with a lower risk of recurrent CHD events independently of the level of LDL-
C. For each 10% lowering of TG attained during the first 30 days of treatment after an ACS 
event, the risk for d eath, myocardial infarction, or recu rrent acute coronary syndrome was 
reduced by 2.3% (p =0.035) af ter adjustment for high LDL-C (>70 mg/dL) and HDL-C (<40 
and 50 mg/dL in men and women, respectively). 
Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Fish Oils 
There is a growing body of evidence, encompa ssing molecular, cellular, animal and human 
studies defining the roles for O3 FAs as bioactive agents for re ducing the risks of and treating 
CVD (Torrejon 2007). Many epi[INVESTIGATOR_816580], and more specifically  between the intake and blood 
levels of O3FAs and CV mortality. For exam ple, when comparing blood levels of O3FAs 
among men who had died of sudden cardiac de ath with controls matched for age and 
smoking status, it was found that participants with the highest blood levels of EPA and DHA 
had a 90% risk reduction for sudden cardiac de ath compared with those with the lowest 
levels (Albert 2002). 
Clinical trials and experimental studies, suggest  important antiatheroge nic and antithrombotic 
effects of O3FAs. These result from wide-ra nging biological effects,  including benefits on 
lipoprotein metabolism, blood pressure, endot helial function and va scular reactivity, 
inflammation, platelet and fi brinolytic function, cytokine  production, coagulation and 
oxidative stress (Mori and Woodman 2006). Evid ence suggests that increased consumption 
of O3FAs from fish or fish-oil supplements re duces the rates of all- cause mortality, cardiac 
and sudden death, and possibly st roke (Wang 2006). The effect was evident in both primary-
prevention (general population without a histor y of CVD) and secondary -prevention (patients 
with a history of CVD) studies with a stronger effect in secondary prevention. 
The Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART) was on e of the first randomized, controlled studies 
to demonstrate the beneficial effects of O3FA s in secondary prevention of CHD and reported 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130693] 2011 Page 26 of 98 a 29% reduction in all-cause mortality over a 2-year peri od in 2033 male MI survivors 
advised to increase their intake  of oily fish (200 to 400 g of fatty fish per week, which 
provided 500 to 800 mg/day of O3FAs) (Burr 19 89). While not statistically significant, there 
was also a trend toward a reduction in recurrent ischemic heart disease events with increased 
fatty fish consumption. A post hoc analysis  of patients receiving fish oil capsules 
(900 mg/day of EPA+DHA) in DART suggested th at the protective effect  was attributable to 
O3FAs (Burr 1994). The greatest benefit was seen in fatal MIs, and this observation led to 
the hypothesis that O3FAs might protect the my ocardium against the adverse sequela of 
acute ischemic stress. 
A cardioprotective effect for O3FA s derived from fish oil is supported by [CONTACT_816723], 
especially amongst high-risk individuals (Mori and Woodma n 2006). Early separation of 
survival curves in the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell’Infarto 
Miocardico (GISSI)-Prevenzione study (GI SSI-Prevenzione Investigators 1999) and the 
DART trial support a reduction in ventricular fibrillation and a decr eased incidence of 
myocardial infarction ( Leaf 1996)  as the primary mechanisms through which O3FAs prevent 
CVD (Mori and Woodman 2006). Many international bodies including the AHA, American College of Cardiology, and the 
European Society of Cardiology have found th e overall evidence for benefit sufficiently 
strong to make public recommendations for in creased O3FA intake for both primary and 
secondary prevention (Harris 2007). 
Omega-[ADDRESS_1130694] the efficacy of O3FAs for 
secondary prevention of CHD is the GISSI study  (GISSI-Prevenzione In vestigators 1999). In 
this study, 11,324 patients with preexisting C HD (experienced an MI and were receiving 
conventional cardiac pharmacotherapy) were rand omized to either 300 mg of vitamin E, 
850 mg of O3FA ethyl esters (as EPA and DHA), both, or neithe r. After 3.5 years of follow-
up, the group given the O3FAs alone experience d a 15% reduction in the primary end point 
of death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal  stroke (p <0.02). There wa s a 20% reduction in all-cause 
mortality (p =0.01) and a 45% reduction in s udden death (p <0.001) compared with the 
control group; vitamin E provided no additiona l benefit. Triglycerides decreased by 4% and 
LDL cholesterol levels increased by 2.5% afte r six months in the O3FA treatment groups 
compared with controls. This trial, although very  large and carried out in a relatively "usual-
care" setting, was not placebo controlled, a nd dropout rates were high (>25%). A follow-up 
study (Marchioli 2002) assessed the time-course of the benefit of O3FAs on mortality in 
subjects in the GISSI-P Study and found that  survival curves diverged early after 
randomization. Total mortality was significantly lowered by 28% after 3 months of treatment 
(RR =0.59), and by 4 months, the risk of  sudden cardiac death was reduced by 45% 
(RR =0.47). 
Ethyl-EPA 
In another larger trial, the Japan EPA Lipi d Intervention Study (JELI S), 18,645 patients with 
hypercholesterolemia (70% women; mean age, 61  years) were randomly assigned to either 
statin alone or statin and pur e ethyl-EPA (1.8 g/day). Of all patients, 15,000 patients (80%) 
were without existing CAD and 3,645 (20%) with existing CAD (Matsuzaki 2009). The 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130695] 2011 Page 27 of 98 primary endpoint was any major adverse corona ry event (MACE including SCD, fatal and 
nonfatal MI, and other nonfatal events including unstable angina pectoris (determined to be 
caused by [CONTACT_816724]/non-i nvasive testing), angi oplasty, stenting, and 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806]).  
In the overall analysis ( Yokoyama 2007), dur ing the 4.6-year follow-up, ethyl-EPA reduced 
major adverse coronary events by 19% (p =0.011). EPA treatment was also associated with a 
significant 24% reduction in the in cidence of unstable angina and a 19% decrease in nonfatal 
coronary events. This treatme nt also produced nonsignifican t reductions of 21%, 25%, and 
14% in fatal MI, nonfatal MI, and revascularizations, respectively. 
In a subgroup analysis of primary prevention cases, compared to patients with normal serum 
TG and HDL-C levels, those with abnormal levels (TG ≥150 mg/dL; HDL-C <40 mg/dL) 
had a significantly higher major adverse corona ry event (MACE) rate by 71% (p=0.014). In 
this higher risk group, ethyl-EPA treatment suppressed the MACE risk by 53% (p=0.043) 
(Saito 2008). 
While there was no significant difference in the incidence of first str oke between ethyl-EPA 
and control groups, the inciden ce of stroke recurrence was si gnificantly lower in the EPA 
group at 6.8% versus the control group at 10.5%, a reduction of 20% (p<0.05; Tanaka 2008). 
Further, while there was no difference in the incidence of recurrent hemorrhagic cerebral 
events between the two groups, ethyl-EPA was effective in reducing the recurrence of 
ischemic cerebral vascular events such as cerebral infarc tion (Harris 2009).  
O3FA supplementation lowered CV risk in bo th the GISSI-Prevenzione study and JELIS, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_816581] (e.g., statins, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], β-blockers 
and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors).  Additionally, the JELIS trial established the 
safety and efficacy of combination therapy with  ethyl-EPA and a statin vs statin therapy 
alone for improving CV prognosis. The JELIS trial was conducted with Epadel that contains 
the same active ingredient, ethyl-EPA, as AMR101. Ethyl-EPA was shown in the JELIS study to reduce CAD events even in a Japanese population with  very high intakes of O3FAs 
due to the high fish consumption. The eviden ce supporting a benefit in primary prevention 
comes from an observed 18% decrease in CV even ts in the 80% of patients in the JELIS trial 
without documented CAD (p =0.13); this effect size was essentially the same as that observed in the secondary preventi on cohort (19%, p <0.05) (Lee 2008). 
Medical Need 
CVD resulting from progressive atheroscle rosis remains the most common cause of 
morbidity and mortality all over the world. Based on 2006 US statistics ( American Heart 
Association 2010), an estimated 81 million American adults (more than one in three) have 
one or more types of CVD. Of these, 38 milli on are estimated to be age 60 or older. Total 
CVD includes coronary heart disease (CHD): 17.6 million, heart failure (HF): 5.8 million and 
stroke: 6.4 million. CHD further divided includ es myocardial infarction (MI): 8.5 million, 
and angina pectoris (AP): 10.2 million. Final mort ality data show that CVD as the underlying 
cause of death accounted for 34.4% of all deat hs (about 830,000 of all 2.4 million deaths in 
2006). CHD is the leading cause of death in all Western indu strialized countries, despi[INVESTIGATOR_816582]-1960s. In developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], the incidence of 
CVD is increasing alarmingly. In addition to death, CVD also causes many serious non-fatal 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130696] s of O3FAs (Ginsberg 
2001; Harris 1997). Hypertriglyceridemia is a co mmon lipid abnormality and often occurs in 
persons who are obese and have insulin resistance , Type 2 diabetes mellitus, or the metabolic 
syndrome (Jacobson 2007; Bays 2008 ). Elevation in TG is positively associated with 
accelerated atherosclerosis leadi ng to CV events, the latter ev en after correction for other 
lipid and non-lipid risk factors (Jacobson 2007). In the US ( American Heart Association  
2010), the mean TG level for American a dults age 18 and older is 144.2 mg/dL (men, 
156.5 mg/dL; women, 132.1 mg/dL).  
Lifestyle modification is important fo r the management of patients with 
hypertriglyceridemia; however, for patients w ho do not adequately re spond to dietary and 
lifestyle restrictions, relatively few classes of drugs are available to treat 
hypertriglyceridemia, and each is associated with  risks that may limit their use alone or in 
combination. Currently available pharmacological treatments for hypertriglyceridemia include fibric acid derivatives (such as gemfibrozil and fenofibrate), niacin in various 
formulations, prescription omega-3-acid et hyl esters (Lovaza/Omaco r) and statins (3 hydroxy 
3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors).  
Although the above agents have robust TG-lowering effects in patients with 
hypertriglyceridemia, the degree of TG-lowering is highly variable; generally greater TG-
lowering effects are observed for fibrates and niacin compared with statins. Many patients will be satisfactorily tr eated with one or more of the above range of drugs (combined with 
appropriate diet and atte ntion to other CV risk factors and lifestyle). 
Lovaza, comprised predominantly of ethyl-EPA and the ethyl ester of docosahexaenoic acid 
(ethyl-DHA), is indicated only in patients wi th very high TG levels (>500 mg/dL), raises 
LDL-C even when combined with statins in pa tients with high TGs (200-499 mg/dL), and is 
approved at 4 g/day (equivalent to 4 capsules/day) resulting in poor patient compliance. A 
non-compliance rate of 35% was reported  in one clinical trial ( Leaf 2005). 
Fibrates are clearly effective at raising HDL-C and lowering TG concentrations. However, 
their effects on vascular events remain uncertai n. Several large-scale tria ls of fibrate therapy 
have been completed in the past few years. Although some of these trials have suggested 
benefit, others have shown no effect, lead ing to uncertainty about the presence and 
magnitude of any cardiovascular protective e ffects and difficulties for clinicians in 
interpretation of the resu lts (Jun 2010). The ACCORD st udy (Ginsberg 2010) reported no 
overall benefit for fenofibrate, raising further questions about the usefulness of these agents. 
There are also safety issues w ith the above agents that limit their clinical use. Statins, 
particularly at high doses, may cause increases in hepatic transaminase s and are also known 
to cause myopathy and occasionally rhabdomyolys is, which may lead to death from acute 
renal failure. This risk may be increased when  fibrates and statins are co-administered and 
many clinicians will avoid co-prescribing these [ADDRESS_1130697] 2011 Page 29 of 98 steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Niacin is also associated with impairment of glucose 
tolerance and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_816583]. 
The DYSlipi[INVESTIGATOR_816584] (DYSIS ) assessed the prevalence of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816585]. This epi[INVESTIGATOR_816586] 
22,[ADDRESS_1130698] three months, and had a clinical diagnosis of coronary or other at herosclerotic disease, 
or were at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_179558]. The study found 48% of patients had LDL-C not at 
goal; 26% had low HDL-C levels; and 38% had elevated triglycerides. This study 
demonstrates that persistent dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816587]-treated patients. 
Patients with dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], particularly thos e with established CVD or diabetes, have 
therapeutic needs that cannot be met by [CONTACT_816725]. It is hypothesized that achieving 
target values for LDL-C/non-HDL-C in these pa tients using a therapeutic approach of the 
combination of AMR101 and a statin will benefi t these patients. Such a combination therapy 
might increase the like lihood of therapeutic success in these patients with regards to future 
risk of CVD, based on meeting of both LDL- C/non-HDL-C goals and TG goals according to 
the ACC/AHA guidelines (Anderson 2007). Approximately [ADDRESS_1130699] high TG levels (>200 mg/dL), however only a minority (3.6%) are currently treated with prescription medication (Ford 2009). Patients with elevated TGs are currently under-served 
and would benefit from a new, safe and e ffective product that can  provide the following 
attributes: 
• Robust efficacy to lower TGs 
• Safe to use with other lipid-lo wering agents, including statins 
• Does not increase LDL-C when used in patients on statin therapy (TG = 200-499 
mg/dL) 
• Has convenient dosing regimen 
• Has class-specific positive outcomes data 
 
Pleiotropic Effects 
There is ample evidence that O3FAs decrease TGs in patients with hypertriglyceridemia 
which is a beneficial effect related to the fact that elevated TGs have been identified as an 
independent risk factor for C VD. Lowering TGs in patients with hypertriglyceridemia would 
lead to a slowing of the development of atherosclerosis. However O3FAs including EPA 
have a wide range of additional pharmacological  effects that most likely contribute to a 
beneficial effect in patients with CVD. 
Beneficial effects in clinical trials have been  attributed in part to  reducing arrhythmias (Lee 
2003; Goel 2002; Calo 2005 ). The case for an antiarrhythmic effect of O3FAs comes from 
clinical trials and from animal studies. Clinical trials have shown that the risk of sudden 
death in patients who have survived myocardial  infarction is greatly reduced by [CONTACT_621394] 
O3FAs in the diet ( Siscovick 2000). Thus it seems that fatal ve ntricular fibrillation is less 
likely to occur during sufficient intake of O3 FAs. Animal studies support this. Coronary 
ligation studies in a variety of species (rats, dogs and marmosets) have shown that the 
incidence of ventricular fibril lation is lower in animals fed a diet rich in O3FAs before 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130700] 2011 Page 30 of 98 ligation (McLennan 1992; Leaf 1996). In isolated  cells, the story is similar (Li 1997, Engler  
2000; Omura 2001). In neonatal rat cardiac m yocytes, EPA prevents the arrhythmogenic 
action of many interventions, including high external Ca2+ and ouabain (Kang 1994). The 
antiarrhythmic effect is caused by a reduction in electrical excitability caused by [CONTACT_816726] 
O3FAs into the phospholipid cell membranes of the cardiac myocytes, which modulates membrane ion channels. This is the postulated direct mechanism that refers to the antiarrhythmic effect of O3FAs which inhibits the fast, voltage-dependent sodium current 
along with the L-type calcium currents. Th is reduces the action potential of cardiac 
myocytes, reducing the susceptibil ity to arrhythmia. These cellul ar alterations are likely to 
reduce the severity of ventri cular arrhythmias by [CONTACT_816727]
2+ following ischemia. It was also shown in patients with coronary artery 
disease that long-term treatment with EPA augments both NO-mediated and non-NO-
mediated endothelium-dependent forearm vasodilatation ( Tagawa 1999). 
Another, indirect mechanism refers to th e effect of O3FAs on cardiac arrhythmias by 
[CONTACT_816728]-products from 
chain elongation of their parent polyunsaturated fatty acids ( Nair 1997). Most investigations 
of the link between O3FAs and heart disease ha ve demonstrated the competition between AA 
and O3FAs to become substrates in the produc tion of eicosanoids. O3FAs compete with AA 
in several ways, but EPA in particular co mpetes with AA as the substrate for the 
cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibiting th e production of thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) and in 
endothelial cells, prostaglandin I 3 (PGI 3) is synthesized from EPA (Nair 1997). The net result 
of these actions is vasodilatation. A reduced  ratio of AA/EPA shifts the spectrum of 
eicosanoid production toward an  increase in thromboxane A 3 (TXA 3) and PGI 3 at the 
expense of TXA 2 and PGI 2, respectively. This shift was found to reduce the risk of 
ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) ( Coker 1982). Excessive 
production of eicosanoids derived from omega-[ADDRESS_1130701] important pharmacologi c properties of EPA is its anti-inflammatory 
and immune-modulating activity (Calder 2006; Ca lder 2010 ). Because of the inflammatory 
events underlying plaque rupture,  the variety of anti-inflammato ry effects of O3FAs may be 
of relevance to atherosclerosi s and its clinical manifestati ons of myocardial infarction, 
sudden death, and stroke ( Mori 2004; Thie s 2003). A randomized controlled study, in 
patients awaiting surgery to remove atherosclerotic plaques in the caro tid artery, has shown 
that an anti-inflammatory response might be  involved, by [CONTACT_816729] O3FAs as a supplement ( 1.4 g/day) and the stabili ty of atherosclerotic 
plaques (Thies 2003). This improved stability was achieved by [CONTACT_816730] O3FAs 
into the plaque. 
The omega-[ADDRESS_1130702] established roles in 
inflammation and AA metabolism is a long reco gnized target for commonly used anti-
inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. O3FAs, are incorpor ated into inflammatory cell phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_144045] a 
time- and dose-dependent manner. They are inco rporated partly at the expense of AA, but 
also other omega-6 fatty acids. EPA and DHA inhibit AA metabolism. Thus production of 
AA-derived eicosanoids is decreased by [CONTACT_75327] O3FA s. EPA gives rise to an alternative family 
of eicosanoids (e.g. PGE 3), which frequently have lower anti-inflammatory potency than 
those produced from AA, and to resolvins (E- and D-series) which have potent anti-
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130703] 2011 Page 31 of 98 inflammatory and inflammation resolving pr operties (Serhan 2006; Dona 2008 ). The plasma 
AA/EPA ratio has been used as a marker of th e inflammatory status in patients with CVD 
(Rupp 2004; Holub 2009). In favor of the concept that less pro-inflamma tory processes can 
be observed already at lower AA/EPA ratios is the finding that  1.4 g/day ethyl-EPA reduced 
the incidence of plaque rupture (Thies 2003) . The AA/EPA ratio had a strong relationship 
with the incidence of CV events such as MA CE in patients undergoing elective PCI ( Domei 
2009). 
In addition to modifying the profile of lipid-derived mediator s, O3FAs can also influence 
peptide mediator (i.e. cytokine) production. Pro-inflammatory cyt okines, or cytokines 
reflecting inflammatory processes, e.g. IL-1be ta, IL-2, IL-6, TNFal pha, platelet-derived 
growth factor (PDGF)-A and -B and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), are 
reduced by [CONTACT_816731]  (von Schacky 2007), and soluble cytokines 
reflecting interactions between blood cells and the vessel wall, such as intercellular adhesion 
molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell ad hesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) ( Yamada 2008). 
EPA and DHA intake also resulted in a d ecreased expression of genes involved in 
inflammatory- and atherogenic-related pathwa ys, such as nuclear transcription factor κB 
signaling, eicosanoid synthesis, scavenger receptor activity, adipogenesis, and hypoxia 
signaling (Bouwens 2009). 
In conclusion, the pleiotropic e ffects of EPA may contribute to the overall beneficial effects 
on the risk of CVD, in addition to the TG-lower ing effect. Therefore, it is possible that the 
efficacious dose of EPA that decr eases the CV event rate is lower than the dose needed to 
exert the maximum TG-lowering effect, and/or that a modest decrease of TGs after EPA 
treatment could still lead to a signif icant decrease in the risk for CVD. 
Dose Selection 
This trial will be conducted with a dose  of AMR101 of 4 g/day (4 capsules/day). 
To date, only one study was published investigat ing the effects of combination treatment 
with an O3FA plus statins on clinical cardiovascular events. This is the Japan EPA Lipid 
Intervention Study (JELIS) (Yokoyama 2007), as previously discussed, wherein ethyl-EPA 
combined with low-dose pravastatin or simvastatin compared with statin therapy alone reduced major coronary events without alteri ng rates of sudden cardiac death. These effects 
were achieved without any signifi cant changes in total, LDL- or HDL-C and a statistically 
significant (p <0.0001) decrease in triglycerides, suggesting th at EPA can lower CVD risk by 
[CONTACT_816732]-C lowering (Yoko yama 2007). In a subanalysis of this study, 
the addition of ethyl-EPA to pravastatin or simvastatin reduced also the incidence of 
coronary heart disease events in high-risk pati ents with metabolic syndrome and atherogenic 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816588]-C (Saito 2008). The JELIS 
study was performed in a large patient popula tion wherein an ethyl-EPA dose of 1.8 g/day 
translated to significant benefits on CV events. 
In the ANCHOR study (Amarin-sponsored), both  the 2 and 4 g/day dosing regimens of 
AMR101 resulted in statistically  significant reductions of TG s (see Section 1.3). However, 
since the 4 g/day dose caused a larger reducti on in TG and other lipid, lipoprotein and 
inflammatory markers, the AMR101 4 g/day dose was selected for the present study. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130704] 2011 Page 32 of 98 1.6. Risk/Benefit 
Across all completed Amarin-sponsored studies, the proportion of patients (based on the 
safety population from the randomized, double-blind periods of the studies) experiencing any adverse events was similar for patients on pl acebo (light paraffin oil) and patients on 
AMR101 (57.1% and 57.4% for placebo and AMR101, respectively). The proportion of 
patients experiencing a serious adverse event (SAE) was also similar for both treatment 
groups (5.2% and 6.0% for placebo and AMR101, re spectively). The safe ty profile in the 
open-label extensions was similar to that obs erved in the double-blind treatment periods. 
There were no SAEs attributed to AMR101 dur ing the open-label exte nsion periods of the 
studies. 
In summary, AMR101 is very well tolerated at daily doses up to [ADDRESS_1130705] 
demonstrated that it is safe. See the Inve stigator’s Brochure for more information.

3.1. Type of Study 
Phase 3b, multi-Center, multin ational, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study 
3.2. Study Population 
The population for this study is men and women ≥45 years of age with established CVD, or 
men and women ≥[ADDRESS_1130708] atherogenic dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816589] (but at treatment goal for LDL-C, by [CONTACT_27180] a 
statin) and hypertriglyceridemia. More details are listed in the inclusion criteria. 
The patients will need to provide written consen t to participate in the study and be willing 
and able to comply with the pr otocol and the study procedures. 
3.3. Study Periods 
This study consists of th e following study periods: 
• Screening Period : During the screening period, pa tients will be evaluated for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
At the first visit to the Research Unit (Vis it 1), study procedures will be performed for 
evaluation of patient’s eligibility in the study. At  this screening visit, patients will sign an 
informed consent form before any study pro cedure is performed; the informed consent 
form will cover the treatment/follow-up peri od. Based on the evaluation from Visit 1, the 
following situations may occur: 
o Patients who are eligible for participati on based on the study procedures on Visit 1 
will return to the Research Unit for Vis it 2 (randomization visit) to start the 
treatment/follow-up period. This case includ es, for example, patients at Visit 1who 
are on a stable dose of a stat in, are planning to stay on the same statin and the same 
dose of the statin, and who not need to  wash out any non-statin lipid-altering 
medications. 
o Patients who are not  eligible for participation based on the study procedures on 
Visit 1 and are unlikely  to become eligible in the next 28 days (for example: 
unlikely to stabilize statin dose, unable to wash out non-st atin lipid-altering 
medications, etc.): these patients wi ll be screen failed after Visit 1. 
o Patients not eligible for participation in  the study based on the study procedures on 
Visit 1 may possibly become eligible in th e next 28 days: these patients may return 
at the discretion of the inve stigator for a second optiona l screening visit (Visit 1.1) 
at which time the procedures needed for re-evaluation of th e previously failed 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  will be repeated. This ca se includes, for example, 
patients who are started on a statin at Visit 1, whose statin dose is changed at Visit 1, 
and/or needed to wash out non-statin lipid-altering medica tions. The following 
applies for these patients: 
• Patients with a change in the statin or statin dose on Visit [ADDRESS_1130709] 2011 Page 35 of 98 at Visit 1.1. Other concomitant medications  (antidiabetic therapy, for example) 
can be optimized or stabilized during this period. 
• Patients starting a washout at Visit [ADDRESS_1130710] 
28 days (only 7 days for bile acid sequestrants) before the lipid qualifying 
measurements at Visit 1.1. 
• Patients at Visit 1 who are on a stable dos e of a statin, are planning to stay on 
the same statin at the same dose, and who do not need any medication washout, but were asked to return for Visit 1.1 to  repeat one or more of the other study 
procedures not related to concomitant medications  
o Patients who become eligible for participation based on the additional study procedures at Visit 1.1 will return to the Research Unit for Visit 2 (randomization 
visit) to start the treatment/follow-up period. 
At the end of the screening period, patients will need to meet all inclus ion/exclusion criteria 
before they can be randomized. Patients who ar e not eligible for pa rticipation after the 
screening period (based on study procedures at Visit 1 and/or Vi sit 1.1) may return at a later 
date for rescreening. These patien ts will need to re-start with  all procedures starting with 
Visit 1. This includes patients who need more time to stabilize one or more conditions or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (for example: statin, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, thyroi d hormone, HIV-protease 
inhibitor therapy). 
• Treatment/Follow-Up Period : Within [ADDRESS_1130711] screening visit and within 
14 days after the second screen ing visit, if one is conducte d, eligible patie nts will enter 
the treatment/follow-up period. During this pe riod, the patients will receive study drug 
during the planned visits at the Research Si te and take the study drug while away from 
the Research Site. 
During the visits, study procedures will be perfor med for evaluation of efficacy and safety. A 
detailed schedule of procedures  is provided in Appendix A. 
3.4. Study Duration 
The estimated study duration includes a plan ned 18-month enrollment period followed by a 
follow-up period of approximately 3.5 years in expected duration (approximately 5 years in 
total). Patients will be randomized at different  times during the enrollment period but will all 
end the study at the same date (study end date). It is planned that all randomized patients will 
receive study medication and be followed-up until the study end date . This is an event-driven 
trial and patients will continue in the trial if  the trial runs longer than expected, or will 
terminate earlier if the trial runs shorter than expected. 
The total duration of the trial is based on a median 4-year follow-up period across patients. 
The first patient randomized would be followe d for 4.75 years (the l ongest individual follow-
up duration), and the last patient randomized would be followed for 3.25 year (the shortest 
individual follow-up duration). 
3.5. Study Groups 
At Visit 2 (Day 0), eligible study patients  will be randomly assigned to the following 
treatment groups: 
• Group 1 : AMR101 4 g daily (four 1000 mg capsules daily) 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130712] 2011 Page 36 of 98 • Group 2 : placebo (four capsules daily) 
The four AMR101 or placebo capsules daily wi ll be taken as two capsules in the morning 
and two capsules in the evening (twice-per-day dosing regimen). 
3.6. Number of Patients 
This is an event-driven trial:  It is expected that a minimu m of 1612 primary efficacy endpoint 
events will be required during the study. A to tal of approximately 7990 patients will be 
entered into the study to either receive AM R101 or placebo (approximately 3995 patients per 
treatment group) in order to observe an es timated 1612 events that make up the primary 
composite endpoint for efficacy. 
3.7. Number of Study Sites 
Participants will be enrolled at multiple Research Sites in multiple countries. 
3.8. Randomization 
On Day 0, eligible patients will be randomized to one of 2 study groups using a computer-
generated randomization schema. Randomized tr eatment assignment to either AMR101 or 
placebo in a 1:1 ratio will be provided using the internet or  a touch-tone telephone via an 
interactive voice response system (IVRS). 
3.9. Blinding 
This is a double-blind study. Patients, investig ators, pharmacists and ot her supporting staff at 
the Research Sites, personnel and designees of the Sponsor, study administrators and 
personnel at the organization(s) and vendors supporting the study will be unaware of the 
randomization code (i.e., they will not know  which study participan ts are receiving the 
experimental drug and which are receiving the placebo drug). The study medication, AMR101 and placebo capsules, will be similar in  size and appearance to maintain blinding. 
During the double-blind treatm ent/follow-up period, everyone (p atients, investigators, 
pharmacists and other supporting staff at the Rese arch Sites, personnel and designees of the 
Sponsor, study administrators and personnel at the organization(s) and vendors managing/supporting the study), with the exceptio n of the laboratory personnel performing 
the analysis, will be blinded to individual re sults of the efficacy la boratory measurements 
(including lipid values). Indivi dual results from the lipid pr ofile may be unblinded in the 
event of an emergency for a patient. 
3.10. Stratification 
Participants will be assigned to treatment groups stratified by [CONTACT_816718], use of 
ezetimibe and by [CONTACT_101820] (Western ized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific 
countries). There are two CV risk categories: 
• CV Risk Category 1: patients with establis hed CVD defined in the inclusion criteria. 
Patients with diabetes and establishe d CVD are included in this category. 
• CV Risk Category 2: patients with diabetes and at least one additional risk factor for 
CVD, but no established CVD. This is primary prevention group. 
Stratification will be recorded in the IVRS at the time of en rollment. Approximately 70% of 
randomized patients will be in the CV Risk Category 1 and approximately 30% of 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130713] 2011 Page 37 of 98 randomized patients will be in the CV Risk Category 2. Enrollment with patients of a CV 
risk category will be stopped when the planned number of patients in that risk category is reached. 
4. STUDY POPULATION 
4.1. Inclusion Criteria 
Patients meeting the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the study: 
1. Fasting TG levels of ≥135 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL. The target for the lower end of the 
fasting TG level is ≥150 mg/dL but because of the variab ility in TG levels, patients will 
qualify for enrolment within 10% of this limit (i.e., ≥135 mg/dL). 
2. On stable therapy with a statin  (with or without ezetimibe), for at least 4 weeks prior to 
the LDL-C/TG baseline qualifying measurements for randomization, to maintain          
LDL-C >40 mg/dL and ≤100 mg/dL 
• Stable therapy is defined as the same daily  dose of the same statin for at least 28 
days before the lipid qualification measurem ents (TG and LDL-C) and, if applicable, 
the same daily dose of ezetimibe for at le ast 28 days before the lipid qualification 
measurements (TG and LDL-C). Patients who have their statin therapy or use of 
ezetimibe initiated at Visit 1, or have thei r statin, statin dose and/or ezetimibe dose 
changed at Visit 1, will need to go through a stabilization period of at least 28 days 
since initiation/change and have their qua lifying lipid measurements measured (TG 
and LDL-C) after the washout  period (at Visit 1.1).  
• Statins may be administered with or without ezetimibe.  
NOTE: If patients qualify at the first qualific ation visit (Visit 1) fo r TG and LDL-C, and 
meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, th ey may be randomized at Visit 2. If patients 
don’t qualify at the first qualifyi ng visit (Visit 1), a second re -qualifying visit (Visit 1.1) 
is allowed. For some patients, because they ne ed to stabilize medications and/or need to 
washout medications, the second re-qualifying vi sit (Visit 1.1) will be needed after the 
stabilization/washout period.

A detailed schedule of procedur es is provided in Appendix A. 
6.1.1. Screening Period 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening Visit (Visit 1) 
Patients will come to the Research Site for Visit 1. They will be instructed  to fast for at least 
10 hours before their visit. 
If patients qualify for randomization based on th e procedures at Visit 1, they need to be 
randomized within 42 days after Visit 1. The foll owing procedures will be performed at the 
screening visit: 
• Obtain signed informed consent 
• Assign the patient a patient number 
• Obtain medical, surgical  and family history 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130727] 2011 Page 43 of 98 • Record demographics 
• Obtain height, weight, and body mass index 
• Obtain vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart ra te, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and oral body temperature) 
• Obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram 
• Evaluate inclusion/exclusion criteria 
• This includes procedures and (fasting)  blood samples (for example, hs-CRP, 
calculated creatinine clearance) as needed  to determine the CV risk category (see 
inclusion criteria) 
• Obtain fasting blood samples for chemistry and hematology testing 
• Obtain a fasting blood sample for the lipid profile (TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, non-
HDL-C, VLDL-C) 
• Perform a urine pregnancy test on women of childbearing potential 
• Record concomitant medication(s) 
• Instruct patient to fast for ≥10 hours prior to the next visit 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening Visit (Visit 1.1) 
Some patients will skip Visit 1.1: Patients w ho qualify for study participation after Visit 1 
because they meet all inclusion criterion and non e of the exclusion criteri a, may return to the 
Research Site for Visit 2 to be randomized and to start the treatment/f ollow-up period of the 
study. For these patients, Visit 2 will occur soon after Visit 1. 
Patients, who do not qualify at Visit 1, may re turn to the Research Site for a second 
qualifying visit (Visit 1.1) at th e discretion of the investigator. At Visit 1.1, procedures that 
caused failure of eligibility at Visit [ADDRESS_1130728] arted treatment with a statin, changed their 
statin, changed the daily dose of their statin, started to washout prohi bited medications or 
started a stabilization period with certain medi cations (see inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
details). Any of these changes at Visit [ADDRESS_1130729] Visit 1.1 to determ ine whether they qualif y based on lipid level 
requirements (TG and LDL-C) determined at Vis it 1. Other procedures that caused failure of 
eligibility at Visit 1 will al so be repeated at Visit 1.1. 
The following procedures will be performed at the screening visit: 
• Obtain vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart ra te, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and oral body temperature)

deemed the patient not eligible on Visit 1. 
• Obtain fasting blood samples for chemistry and hematology testing. Only those 
samples will be obtained that deemed the patient not eligible on Visit 1. 
• Obtain a fasting blood sample for the lipid profile (TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, non-
HDL-C, VLDL-C) if the patient was deemed  not eligible on Visit 1. This includes 
patients who at Visit 1 started treatment w ith a statin, changed their statin, changed 
the daily dose of their statin, started to washout prohibited medications or started a 
stabilization period with certain medications  (see inclusion/excl usion criteria for 
details). These patients will have a fasting blood sample collected at Visit 1.1 for the 
qualifying lipid values (TG and LDL-C), a nd the TG and LDL-C inclusion criteria 
will be evaluated.

study date, there will be a last visit with  procedures as listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Last Visit – End of Study 
All patients will complete the study at the sa me time (within a 30-day window after the study 
end date), irrespective of the date that they were randomized. The end date of the study is 
planned for Day [ADDRESS_1130735] 
occurred (event-driven trial). For each patient, th e last visit may occur within [ADDRESS_1130736] form, un til/unless appropriate 
information is obtained. 
At Visit 13, the following procedures will be performed: 
• Perform physical examination 
• Obtain weight 
• Obtain vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart ra te, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and oral body temperature) 
• Measure waist circumference  
• Obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram 
• Obtain fasting blood samples for: o Chemistry and hematology testing 
o Lipid profile 
o Biomarker assays 
o Archiving (in countries and at sites approved by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC and dependent on 
country regulations) 
• Determine study drug compliance by [CONTACT_816736] 
• Assess and record efficacy events 
• Assess for and record adverse events 
• Record concomitant medication(s)

• Day 1530 ±5 days 
• Day 1620 ±5 days 
• Day 1710 ±5 days 
If the treatment/follow-up period of the st udy is extended beyond the expected end date 
(Day 1800), additional follow-up phone calls wi ll be made every 3 months in-between 
additional visits ±5 days. See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for the timing of the additional visits. If the 
treatment/follow period of the study is shorter than the expe cted end date, less follow-up 
phone calls will be needed. 
Every attempt will be made to talk to  each patient within this time frame. 
The following information will be collected from the patient: 
• Possible efficacy endpoints related to CV even ts. Patients will be asked to return to 
the Research Site to assess for any endpoints or events identified. 
• Adverse events 
• Concomitant medications 
• Current address and contact [CONTACT_3031] ( update if changed or will be changing) 
Patients will be reminded about the following items: 
• To take the study medication according to  the dosing schedule  assigned, with food 
• When to return to the Research Center for the next visit 
• To bring the unused study me dication to the next visit 
• To not take study drug on the morning of their next visit 
• To fast for at least [ADDRESS_1130738] 10 hours. For the purposes of this study, fasting is defined 
as nothing by [CONTACT_24340] (and any essentia l medications). 
The investigator must review a nd sign all laboratory test report s. At screening, patients who 
have laboratory values that are outside the exclusionary limits specified in the exclusion 
criteria may not be enrolled in  the study (patients can be cons idered for the study if values 
are classified as not clinical ly significant by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator). Af ter randomization, the 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130739] c linically appropriate follow-up procedures. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Laboratory Tests 
The safety laboratory tests include: 
• Hematology with complete blood count (CBC), including RBC, hemoglobin (Hgb), 
hematocrit (Hct), white cell blood count (WBC ), white cell differential, and platelet 
count 
• Biochemistry panel including total prot ein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), total 
bilirubin, glucose, calcium, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, ur ic acid, creatinine phosphokinase, HbA 1c. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Fasting Lipid Profile 
The fasting lipid panel includes: TG, TC , LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, and VLDL-C.  
At all visits, LDL-C will be calculated usi ng the Friedewald equation, or measured by 
[CONTACT_248139] (Beta Quant) if at the same visit TG >400 mg/dL . These 
LDL-C values will be used for the evaluati on of the LDL-C inclusion criterion (LDL-C 
qualifying measurements for randomization) and fo r the assessment of changes in the statin 
therapy when LDL-C is not at goal. In addition, irrespective of the TG levels, at Visit 2 (0 
Months of Follow-up, baseline) and at Visit 4 (12 Months of Follow-up), LDL-C will be 
measured by [CONTACT_255629] (Beta Quant). These direct LDL-C measurements will be 
used in the statistical analysis including the calculation of the percen t change from baseline 
(1 year versus baseline). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Genetic testing 
A fasting blood sample will be stored for future genetic testing at the discretion of the 
sponsor. The specifics of this test will be determ ined at a later date. Th is sample is optional 
as local regulations may prohibit genetic samp les to be collected or shipped outside the 
country, or patients may not consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biomarkers Assays 
The biomarker assays include: hs-CRP, Apo B and hsTnT. [IP_ADDRESS]. Additional laboratory tests 
Additional laboratory tests include: 
• A urine pregnancy test will be administered to women of childbearing potential at 
certain visits as listed in schedule of procedures (Appe ndix A). The urine pregnancy 
tests will be performed at the Research Site utilizing marketed test kits, or at a 
certified clinical laboratory. 
• A fasting blood sample (12 mL) for archiving. This sample will be collected only at 
sites in countries where allowed by [CONTACT_816738]. The plasma from the archiving sample will be stored frozen in 2 separate equal aliquots, a nd will be used at the Sponsor’s discretion to perform 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130740] 2011 Page 50 of 98 repeat analyses described in the protocol or to perform other tests related to 
cardiovascular health. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blinding of Laboratory Results 
All efficacy laboratory results during the double- blind period of the trial will be blinded 
(values not provided) to patients, investigators, pharmacists a nd other supporting staff at the 
Research Sites, personnel and designees of th e Sponsor, study administrators and personnel 
at the organization(s) and vendors managing and/or supporting the study, with the exception 
of the laboratory personnel conducting the assays. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Flagging of Critical Lab Values 
Critical lab values are values that may warrant medical intervention to avoid possible harm to 
a patient. Critical lab values will be defined in the Laboratory Manual for the study, and the 
Research Site will be notified of the occurrence of  a critical lab value (critical high or critical 
low) by a special annotation (flag)  in the laboratory reports prov ided to the Research Sites. 
Although laboratory values that are part of  the efficacy endpoints during the double-blind 
period of the study will not be provided to the Research Site (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the sites 
will be notified when the TG value of a patient sample is >1000 mg/dL (critical high TG 
value) or if the LDL-C values of a patient sa mple is >130 mg/dL. These critical high values 
will need to be confirmed by a repeat meas urement (new fasting blood sample) within 7 
days.  
If TG values are confirmed high, patients may be discontinued from study drug with the 
option to remain on study (see Section 11.1 ODIS).  
If LDL-C values are confirmed high the inves tigator may either increase the dose of the 
present statin therapy or may add ezetimibe to lower LDL-C. The investigator should use the 
best clinical judgment for each patient. 
6.3.2. Medical Procedures 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medical, Surgical and Family History 
Medical history, including family history and details regarding all illnesses and allergies, 
date(s) of onset, status of current condition, and smoking and alcohol use will be collected on 
all patients. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Demographics 
Demographic information including day, month, and year of birth, race, and gender will be 
collected for all patients. [IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs 
Vital signs include systolic and diastolic blood pr essure, heart rate, resp iratory rate, and oral 
body temperature. Blood pressure will be measured using a standardized process: 
• Patient should sit for ≥5 minutes with feet flat on the floor and measurement arm 
supported so that the midpoint of the manometer cuff is at heart level. 
• Use a mercury sphygmomanometer or automatic blood pressure device with an 
appropriately sized cuff with the bladder centered over the brachial artery. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130741] 2 mmHg 
mark. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physical Examination 
A physical examination must include source docu mentation of general appearance, skin, and 
specific head and neck, heart, lung, abdomen, ex tremities, and neuromuscular assessments.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Height, Weight and Body Mass Index 
Height and weight will be measured. Measurement of weight should be performed with the 
patient dressed in indoor clothing, with shoes removed, and bladder empty.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Waist Circumference 
Waist circumference will be measured with a tape  measure, as follows: Start at the top of the 
hip bone then bring the tape measure all the wa y around – level with the navel. Make sure the 
tape measure is snug, but without compressing the skin, and that it is pa rallel with the floor.  
Patients should not hold their breath while measuring waist circumference. 
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
ECGs (standard 12-lead) will be obtained annually. Site personnel should make every 
attempt to perform a patient’s ECG using the sa me equipment at each visit. ECGs will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_816739] s ilent MI. Silent MIs will be sent for event 
adjudication.  
7. TREATMENT AND RESTRICTIONS 
7.1. Treatment 
7.1.1. Treatment Regimen, Dosage, and Duration 
Eligible study patients will be randomly assigned on Day 0 to one of the 2 treatment groups. 
Patients in each group will r eceive either 4 g/day AMR101 or placebo for up to 4.75 years 
(4 years planned median treatment duration) according to  Table 1 . 
The daily dose of study drug is 4 capsules per day taken as two capsules taken on two 
occasions per day (2 capsules given twice daily). 
 
Table 2. Dosing Schedule during the Treatment Period 
Treatment 
Group Daily Dose Number of Capsules per Day 
[ADDRESS_1130742] 2011 Page 52 of 98  
 
 
  Patients will be instructed to take study drug with food (i.e., with or at the end of their 
morning and evening meals). On days that pati ents are scheduled for study visits, the daily 
dose of study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_816740]. For the purposes of this study, fasting is 
defined as nothing by [CONTACT_24340] (and any essential medications) for at least 10 
hours. 
7.1.2. Treatment Assignment 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Identification number 
A unique patient identification number (patient number) will be established for each patient 
at each site. The patient number will be used to identify the patient throughout the study and 
will be entered on all documentation. If a patient is  not eligible to receive  treatment, or if a 
patient discontinues from the study, the patien t number cannot be reassigned to another 
patient. The patient number will be used to assign patients to one of the 2 treatment groups 
according to the randomization schedule. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Drug Randomization 
Only qualified patients who m eet all of the inclusion crite ria and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be randomized and will receive study medication starting at Visit 2 (Day 0). 
Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to  one of the 2 treatment groups. Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_816718], use of ezetimibe and by [CONTACT_101820] 
(Westernized, Eastern European, and As ia Pacific countries) (See Section 3.10). 
Approximately 70% of randomized patients will be in the CV Risk Category 1, including 
patients with established CVD, and approximately  30% of randomized patients will be in the 
CV Risk Category 2, including patients with diab etes and at least one additional risk factor 
but no established CVD. Enrollment with patien ts of a CV risk category will be stopped 
when the planned number of patients in  that risk category is reached. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Emergency Unblinding 
In an emergency, when knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the patien t, the investigator may request the patient’s 
treatment assignment for unblinding. Prior to unblinding the patient’s individual treatment 
assignment, the investigator should assess th e relationship of an adverse event to the 
administration of the study drug (Yes or No).  If the blind is broken for any reason, the 
investigator must record the date and reason for breaking the blind on the appropriate Case 
Report Form (CRF) and source documents. 
7.1.3. Compliance Control 
It is recommended that, unless cl ear contraindications arise, pa tients be strongly encouraged 
to adhere to their treatment regimen with th e study drug for the durat ion of the trial. Any [ADDRESS_1130743] 2011 Page 53 of 98 interruptions of therapy should, if possible, be brief (e.g., <4 weeks) and only for clinically 
indicated reasons, such as adverse events. Discontinuations will be discouraged as much as 
possible. Any discontinuations should be  based on compelling clinical reasons. 
For every patient, an assessment of compliance to the study drug treatment regimen must be obtained at each scheduled visit. Study medication will be dispensed in amounts exceeding the amount required for the study. Patients will be instructed to re turn all unused study 
medication at the next visit. Compliance to th e study drug regimen will be evaluated at each 
visit by [CONTACT_618637]. Discrepancies will be evaluated and discussed with each 
patient to assess compliance. If compliance is unsatisfactory, the patient will be counseled about the importance of complia nce to the dosing regimen. At the end of the study, the final 
study medication compliance will be determ ined by [CONTACT_816736] (see Section 
12.2.2). 
7.2. Study Restrictions 
7.2.1. Concomitant Medications during Treatment/Follow-Up Period 
Any medications administered during th e study period must be documented on the 
Concomitant Medication CRF. Patients must not ha ve taken any investigational agent within 
90 days prior to screening. Patie nts cannot participate in any ot her investigational medication 
trial while participating in this study.  
The following non-study drug related, non-statin, lip id-altering medications and supplements, 
and foods are prohibited during the screening period (after Vi sit 1 to Visit 2), and are 
strongly discouraged during the study afte r Visit 2: 
• niacin >200 mg/day; 
• fibrates; 
• prescription omega-3 fatty acid medications; 
• dietary supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., flaxseed, fish, krill, or 
algal oils); 
• bile acid sequestrants; 
• cyclophosphamide; 
• systemic retinoids 
If any of these products would be used duri ng the treatment/follow-up period of the study, it 
should be for compelling medical reasons, and it should be documented in the Concomitant Medication CRF. 
Foods enriched with omega-3 fatty acids ar e strongly discouraged after Visit 1 for the 
duration of the study.  
The following products are allowed: statins, ezetimibe, and herbal products & dietary 
supplements not containing omega-3 fatty acids. Statins: 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130744] 2011 Page 54 of 98 • The same statin at the same dose should  be continued until the end of the study, 
unless deemed medically necessary to change because of an adverse event or lack of 
efficacy (LOE).  It is preferred that if LOE is the determining factor that ezetimibe 
be added to the present dose. 
• Switching between a brand name [CONTACT_816950]. 
•  Statins may be administered with or without ezetimibe. 
• Based on the FDA recommendation, simvastatin  [ADDRESS_1130745] not experienced any 
muscle toxicity. (See reference:  FDA Drug Safety Communication: Ongoing safety review of high-dose Zocor (simvastatin) and increased risk of muscle injury. 
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm204882.htm)  
• Changing of the type of statin or the statin dose during the treatment/follow-up 
period of the study should only be done for compelling medical reasons and must be 
documented in the CRF. 
LDL-C Rescue: 
• If the level of LDL-C exceeds 130 mg/dL dur ing the study (initial measurement and 
confirmed by a second determination at le ast 1 week later), the investigator may 
either increase the dose of the present st atin therapy or may add ezetimibe to lower 
LDL-C. The investigator should use the be st clinical judgment for each patient.  
No data are available with regard to potenti al interactions between ethyl-EPA and oral 
contraceptives. There are no reports suggesti ng that omega-[ADDRESS_1130746] ed to refrain from excessive 
alcohol consumption, to maintain their current dietary regimen, and to not alter their normal

8.4. Dispensing Procedures and Storage Conditions 
8.4.1. Dispensing Procedures 
At Visit 2 (Day 0), patients will be assigned study drug according to their treatment group 
determined by [CONTACT_21477]. Once assigned to a treatment group, patients will 
receive study drug supplies. At each visit, pa tients will bring unused drug supplies dispensed 
to them earlier. From the drug supplies assign ed to each patient, site personnel will 
administer drug while the patien ts are at the Research Site. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130748] the IVRS system or  a designee of the Sponsor for 
the study (if no IVRS system is used) wh en any unscheduled replacements of study 
medication are needed. 
During the last visit during the treatment period, patients will bring the unused drug supplies 
for site personnel to calculate the final study medication compliance by [CONTACT_816736] 
(see Section 12.2.2).  
8.4.2. Storage Conditions 
At the Research Sites, study drugs must be stored at room temperature, 68°F to 77°F (20°C 
to 25°C). Do not allow storage temperature to  go below 59°F (15°C) or above 86°F (30°C). 
Store in the original package. 
Study drugs must be stored in a pharmacy or lo cked and secure storage facility, accessible 
only to those individuals authori zed by [CONTACT_816742]. The investigator 
or designee will keep accurate dispensing records. At the conclusion of the study, study site 
personnel will account for all used and unused  study drug. Any unused study drug will be 
destroyed. The investigator agrees not to dist ribute study drug to any patient, except those 
patients participa ting in the study. 
9. EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
9.1. Specification of Variables and Procedures 
The primary endpoint and the majority of the secondary and tertiary endpoints are based on 
clinical events related to CVD and mortality. All events occurring between randomization 
and the study end date (inclusive) must be reco rded. Only adjudicated events will be included 
in the final analyses. Further details on the asse ssment of clinical even ts and their definitions 
will be found in the CEC charter. Important definitions are listed in Appendix B of this 
protocol. 
9.2. Efficacy Endpoints 
9.2.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Time from randomization to the first occurren ce of the composite of the following clinical 
events: 
• CV death, 
• Nonfatal MI (including silent MI; ECGs will be performed annually for the detection 
of silent MIs), 
• Nonfatal stroke, 
• Coronary revascularization  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816573]/non-invasive testing . 
The first occurrence of any of these major adverse vascular events during the follow-up 
period of the study will be included in the incidence. 
9.2.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is: 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130749] 2011 Page 57 of 98 • The composite of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization, 
unstable angina, nonfatal stroke, or pe ripheral CVD requiring intervention, 
angioplasty, by[CONTACT_4897], or aneurysm repair. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints are as fo llows (to be tested in said order): 
• The composite of total mortality, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke; 
• The composite of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization, 
unstable angina, peripheral CVD, or cardi ac arrhythmia requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
• The composite of death from CV causes, nonf atal MI, coronary revascularization, or 
unstable angina; 
• The composite of death from  CV causes or nonfatal MI; 
• Total mortality; 
• Fatal and nonfatal MI (including silent MI); 
• Coronary Revascularization;  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816573]/non-invasive testing ; 
• Fatal and nonfatal stroke. 
For the secondary endpoints that count a single event, the first occurrence of this type of 
event will be counted in each patient. For s econdary endpoints that are composites of two or 
more types of events, the first occurrence of any of the event t ypes included in  the composite 
will be counted in each patient. 
 
9.2.3. Tertiary Efficacy Endpoints: 
• The second, third, fourth, and fifth majo r CV event of the primary composite 
endpoint. The type of (nonfatal) events may occur in any order. 
• Primary endpoint in subset of patients with diabetes mellitus; 
• Primary endpoint in subset of pa tients with metabolic syndrome; 
• New CHF, new CHF leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28689], transient ischemic  attack, amputation 
for CVD and carotid revascularization; 
• Elective coronary revascularization and emergent coronary revascularization; 
• New onset  diabetes; 
• Fasting TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C , VLDL-C, apo B, hs-CRP, and hsTnT: 
on treatment change and baseline effect; 
• CV mortality; 
• Cardiac Arrhythmias re quiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
• Cardiac Arrest; 
• To explore the effect of AMR101 on  weight and waist circumference. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130750] occurrence of any of the event types included in the composite will 
be counted in each patient (except when stated  otherwise, for the second, third, fourth, and 
fifth major CV event). 
10. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
10.1. Specification of Variables and Procedures 
Safety assessments will include adverse events, clinical laboratory measurements (chemistry, 
hematology), 12-lead ECGs, vital signs (systo lic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral body temperature) , and physical examinations as per Study 
Procedures/Appendix A. 
A complete medical, surgical and family history will be completed at Visit 1. 
A list of the analytes to be measured for th e safety evaluation is found in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. All 
laboratory test results must be evaluated by [CONTACT_816743]. 
Any observations at physical examinations or laboratory values considered by [CONTACT_816744]. 
10.2. Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with the medicati on under investigation. An adverse event can 
therefore be any unfavorable  and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally asso ciated with the use of an investigational 
medication product, whether or not related to  the investigational medication product. All 
adverse events, including observe d or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to 
be recorded on the appropriate CRF. Each adve rse event is to be evaluated for duration, 
intensity, and causal relationship with the study medication or other factors. 
Adverse events, which include clinical laborator y test variables, will  be monitored from the 
time of informed consent until st udy participation is complete. Patients should be instructed 
to report any adverse event that they experien ce to the investigator. Beginning with Visit 2, 
investigators should assess for adverse events at each visit and record the event on the 
appropriate adverse event CRF. Wherever possible, a specific di sease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_816745]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or sy mptom is not considered a com ponent of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_093], it should be reco rded as a separate adverse event on the CRF. 
Any medical condition that is present when a patient is screened or present at baseline that 
does not deteriorate should not be reported as an adverse event. However, medical conditions 
or signs or symptoms present at  baseline and that change in se verity or seriousness at any 
time during the study should be repo rted as an adverse event. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen will be reported as adverse events or SAEs. The investigator wi ll exercise his or her medical and scientific 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130751] 2011 Page 59 of 98 judgment in deciding whether an abnormal labor atory finding or other abnormal assessment 
is clinically significant. 
The investigator will rate the se verity (intensity) of each advers e event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study 
drug using the categories of Yes or No. Severity: 
• Mild – An event that is usually transient in  nature and generally not interfering with 
normal activities. 
• Moderate – An event that is suf ficiently discomforting to interf ere with norm al 
activities. 
• Severe – An event that is incap acitating with inability to work or do usual activity or 
inability to work or pe rform normal daily activity. 
 
Causality Assessment: 
The relationship of an adverse event to the ad ministration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
• No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – Th e time course between the administration 
of study drug and the occurrence or worseni ng of the adverse event rules out a causal 
relationship and another cause (concom itant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is 
suspected. 
• Yes – The tim e course between the adm ini stration of study drug and the occurrence 
or worsening of the adverse event is consis tent with a causal re lationship and no other 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], co mplications, etc.) can be identified. 
 
The following factors should also be considered: 
• The temporal sequence from study medication administration 
• The event should occur after the study m edicat ion is given. The length of tim e from 
study medication exposure to even t should be evaluated in th e clinical context of the 
event. 
• Underlying, concomitant, in tercurrent diseases 
• Each report should be evaluated in the contex t of the natural history and course of the 
disease being treated and any othe r disease the patient may have. 
• Concomitant medication 
• The other m edications the patien t is taking or the tre atment the patien t receives 
should be examined to determine whether a ny of them might be recognized to cause 
the event in question. 
• Known response pattern for th is class of study medication 
• Clinical and/or preclinical da ta may indicate whether a par ticular response is likely to 
be a class effect. 
• Exposure to physical an d/or mental stresses 
• The exposure to stress m ight induce advers e changes in the patient and provide a 
logical and better explan ation for the event. 
• The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study medication 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130752] 2011 Page 60 of 98 • The known pharm acologic properties (absor ption, distribution, m etabolism, and 
excretion) of the study medi cation should be considered. 
Unexpected Adverse Events  – An unexpected adverse event is  an adverse event either not 
previously reported or where the nature, seriousness, severity, or outcome is not consistent 
with the current Investigator’s Brochure. 
10.2.1. Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following 
criteria: 
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening- Note: The term  “life-th reatening” in the de finition of “serious” 
refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the tim e of the event. It 
does not refer to an event, which hypotheti cally might have caused death, if it were 
more severe. 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588]- Note: In general, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117706] a pre-existing condition(s) that did no t worsen from 
baseline is not considered adverse even ts and should not be reported as SAEs. 
• Results in disability/incapacity 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Is an important medical event- Note: Importa nt medical events that may not result in 
death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816591], 
based upon appropriate m edical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and m ay require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the outcom es listed above. 
Examples of such m edical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency. 
For the purposes of this study SAEs that are primary endpoint events will only be recorded 
for the endpoint determination and not capture d as SAEs. Following adju dication if the event 
is determined to not meet the criteria for a pr imary event, the event will be evaluated as an 
SAE beginning with that day as Day 0. 
10.3. Serious Adverse Event Reporting – Procedure for Investigators 
10.3.1. Initial Reports 
All SAEs occurring from the time of inform ed consent until [ADDRESS_1130753] be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 
hours  of the knowledge of the occurr ence (this refers to any adve rse event that meets any of 
the aforementioned serious criteria). SAEs that  the investigator cons iders related to study 
medication occurring after the 30-day follow-up pe riod will also be reported to the Sponsor 
or designee. 
The investigator is requ ired to submit SAE reports to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) in accordance with local requirements . All 
investigators involved in studies using the sa me investigational medicinal product (IMP) will 
receive any Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) reports for onward 
submission to their local IRB as required. All re ports sent to investigators will be blinded. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130754] continue to follow the patient until the SAE has subsided, or until the 
condition becomes chronic in natu re, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the 
patient dies. Within [ADDRESS_1130755] 
update the SAE form electronically in th e EDC system for the study and submit any 
supporting documentation (e.g., laboratory test  reports, patient di scharge summary, or 
autopsy reports) to the Sponsor or designee via fax or email. 
10.3.3. Reporting by [CONTACT_816746]. Cases will be 
unblinded for reporting purposes as required. 
10.4. Exposure In Utero During Clinical Trials 
If a patient becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator should report the pregnancy 
to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_1130756] the Exposure In Utero  form to the investigator for completion. 
The patient should be followed by [CONTACT_816747]. If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason before the antici pated date, the investig ator should notify the 
Sponsor or designee. At the completion of th e pregnancy, the investig ator will document the 
outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum co mplication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the inve stigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting an SAE. 
11. TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION/PATIENT WITHDRAWAL 
Patients may withdraw from the study at  any time and for any reason. Study drug 
administration may also be discon tinued at any time, at the disc retion of the investigator. In 
any case, follow-up for efficacy and safety should be continued. 
11.1. Reasons for Early Study Drug Discontinuation 
Study drug discontinuation should be  avoided as much as possible, but may be done for any 
of the following reasons: 
• Patient withdraws consent or requests earl y discontinuation from  the study for any 
reason. Patients should be en couraged to continue to participate in the study for the 
entire duration of the study even if they choose not to take study m edication any 
longer. 
• Occurrence of a clinical or laborato ry advers e event, either serious or non-serious, at 
the discretion of the investigator. T he S ponsor or designee shoul d be notified if a 
patient is discontinued because of an advers e event or laboratory abnormality. It is 
recommended that, u nless clear contraindi cations arise, patients be strong ly 
encouraged to adhere to their treatment re gimen with the study drug for the duration 
of the trial. Any interruptions of therapy s hould, if possible, be brief (e.g., <4 weeks) 
and only for clinically indi cated reasons, such  as adverse events. Th e following 
should be considered reason for discontinuation: 
o ALT > 3x ULN and bilirubin > 1.5x ULN 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130757] 2011 Page 62 of 98 o ALT >5x ULN 
o ALT >3x ULN and appearance or worsening of hepatitis 
o ALT > 3x ULN persisting for >4weeks 
o ALT > 3x ULN and cannot be monitored weekly for 4 weeks 
• Any medical condition or personal circ umstance that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], exposes the patient to risk  by [CONTACT_816748] e study or precludes 
adherence to the protocol. 
• Sponsor discontinues the study. 
• A TG value that is flagged as critically high, i.e., > 1000 mg/dL, and confirm ed as 
critically high by a re peat measurement (new fasting blood sam ple) within 7 days. In 
this case, a patient m ay be discontinue d from study drug and other lipid-altering 
medications may be (re)initiated. 
Occurrence of an outcome even t according to the judgment of the investigator is not 
considered a valid reason for study drug discontinuation. 
Patients whose treatment with study medica tion is discontinued early, and have not 
withdrawn consent, may stay in study and will be monitored until the end of the study. 
Patients that continue in the study after indefinite cessation of  therapy will be characterized 
as Off Drug In Study (ODIS). If not contraindicated, patients will also have the option to 
restart study medication at any poi nt once characterized as ODIS. 
The reason for study drug discontinuation or interruption will be recorded on the CRF. 
11.2. Follow-Up after Early Study Drug Di scontinuation/Lost to Follow-Up 
• Patients who prematurely discontinue study drug are not to be replaced. 
• All randomized patients must be followed up according to the st udy flowchart until 
the study end date or death, regardless of  whether they discontinue study drug 
prematurely or not. Any event occurring after early study dr ug discontinuation will be 
recorded up through the study end date. 
• In order to f ollow the medical status of the patients, especially when they withdraw 
after having experienced an advers e event,  investigators are encouraged to obtain  
information from the patient’s prim ary care practitioner (phys ician or any other 
medical care provider). Investig ators are also requested to try as much as possible to 
re-contact [CONTACT_816749] e end of the trial to obta in at least their vital status as 
well as their status with resp ect to the primary en dpoint, and thus avoid lost to follow-
up for the efficacy assessment. 
• If patients are lost to follo w-up, the CRF m ust be complete d up to the last visit or 
contact. Patients who didn’t ha ve a study visit for [ADDRESS_1130758] 
to follow-up. 
12. STATISTICS 
12.1. Analysis Populations 
12.1.1. Randomized Population 
The randomized population will incl ude all patients who sign
 the informed consent form and 
are assigned a randomization number at Visit 2 (Day 0). 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130759] 2011 Page 63 of 98 12.1.2. Intent-to-Treat Population  
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) populati on will consist of all randomized  patients who take at least 
one dose of study drug. The ITT population is th e primary analysis population. All efficacy 
analyses will be performed on the ITT population. 
12.1.3. Per-Protocol Population 
The per-protocol (PP) population will include all ITT patients without any major protocol 
deviations, and who had ≥80% compliance with study drug while on treatment (up to 
discontinuation for patients whose treatment is terminated early). The per-protocol efficacy 
analysis for CV events will be restricted to each patient’s time on study drug plus [ADDRESS_1130760] one dose of study drug. This is the same as the ITT 
population. 
12.2. Statistical Methods 
Safety and efficacy variables will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods to be 
described in detail in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized 
before study unblinding. 
12.2.1. Patient Disposition and Demographic/Baseline Characteristics 
The numbers of patients screen ed, the number of patients randomized per treatment group 
(randomized population), and the number of patients in the ITT and PP populations by 
[CONTACT_816750]. 
For randomized patients who discontinued treatment with study drug, the primary reason for 
discontinuation will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviati on, median, minimum and maximum) will be 
provided by [CONTACT_816751] (e.g., age, sex, race, and 
ethnicity) and baseline characte ristics (e.g., body weight, height, and body mass index) in the 
ITT and PP populations. Demographic data and baseline characteristics will be compared among treatment groups for 
the ITT and PP population. Differences in demogr aphic and baseline characteristics will be 
tested using a chi-square test (for categorical variables) or a 1-way analysis of variance 
model with treatment as a fact or (for continuous variables). The p-values will be used as 
descriptive statistics, primar ily as an assessment of the adequacy of randomization. 
12.2.2. Study Medication Exposure and Compliance 
The final compliance to study drug will be calculated  as the percent of doses taken relative to 
doses scheduled to be taken. Overall percent co mpliance will be calculated per patient in the 
ITT and PP populations and summarized by [CONTACT_816752] (n, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130761] 2011 Page 64 of 98 12.2.3. Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_419148]/therapy verbatim terms will be coded using the latest version of the 
World Health Organization Drug Dictionary. The numbers and percentages of patients in each treatment group taking concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_816753]. 
12.2.4. Analysis of Efficacy 
For efficacy endpoints including CV events, only adjudicated events will be included in the 
final statistical analyses. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary Statistics 
Summary statistics (n, mean, standard devia tion, median, minimum, and maximum) for the 
baseline and post-baseline measurements, the percent changes, or changes from baseline will 
be presented by [CONTACT_816754]. The 
summary statistics will include changes in body weight and body mass index from baseline 
by [CONTACT_35080]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any 
component of the composite of the following clinical events: 
• CV death, 
• Nonfatal MI (incl uding silent MI), 
• Nonfatal stroke, 
• Coronary revascularization,  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816572]/non-invasive testing. 
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be perf ormed using the log-rank test 
comparing the 2 treatment groups (AMR101 and placebo) and including the stratification 
factor “CV risk category”, use of ezetimibe and by [CONTACT_101820] (Westernized, 
Eastern European, and Asia Paci fic countries) as recorded in  the IVRS at the time of 
enrollment. Treatment difference will be te sted at alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_1130762] ratio fo r treatment group (AMR101 vs. placebo) from a 
Cox proportional hazard model that includes the stratification fact or will also be reported, 
along with the associated 95% c onfidence interval. Kaplan-Meier  estimates from the time to 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be plotted. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Endpoints 
The statistical analyses of the secondary endpoints will be analyzed by [CONTACT_816755]-rank test 
specified above for the primary efficacy endpoint . Treatment differences will be tested at 
alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_1130763] 
and the associated 95% confidence intervals wi ll also be provided. Kaplan-Meier estimates 
from the time to the secondary e fficacy endpoints will be plotted. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130764] 2011 Page 65 of 98 [IP_ADDRESS]. Tertiary Endpoints 
For event rates, the statistical analyses of the tertiary endpoints will be similar to the analysis 
of the secondary efficacy endpoints. 
For measurements of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], lipoproteins and in flammatory markers the change from baseline 
will be analyzed in the units of each mark er, and the percent change from baseline. 
New onset diabetes is defined as Type 2 diabetes newly diagnosed during the 
treatment/follow-up period (i.e. pa tients with no history of diab etes at randomization, with 
the test as listed in Appendix C). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subgroup Analyses  
The following subgroups will be explored. Log-rank tests, treatment effects and the 
associated 95% confidence intervals for the pr imary and secondary efficacy endpoints within 
each subgroup will be provided using the Cox proportional hazard model with treatment (AMR101 or placebo), and stratif ication as a factor (with th e exception of the subgroup 
analyses of those subgroup variab les related to the stra tification factors, i.e., CV risk category 
that will not have strati fication as a factor): 
• Gender, 
• age (<65 yr and ≥ 65 yr), 
• race (white and nonwhite, or any other subset with at least 10% of the total number of 
patients), 
• CV risk category (previous CV disease or not), 
• the presence/absence of diabetes at baseline, 
• baseline LDL-C (by [CONTACT_816756]), 
• baseline HDL-C (by [CONTACT_816756]), 
• baseline TG (by [CONTACT_816756]), 
• hs-CRP ( ≤3 mg/L and >3 mg/L), 
• Apo B (by [CONTACT_816756]) 
The consistency of the treatment effects in subgroups will be assessed for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. For each subgr oup variable, a Cox proportional hazard model 
with terms for treatment, stra tification factors (wit h the exception of t hose subgroup variables 
related to the stratif ication factors, i.e., CV risk category), subgroup, and treatment-by-
subgroup interaction will be performed. The main tr eatment effect will not be tested with this 
model. P-values for testing the interaction terms will be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Interim Efficacy Analysis 
One interim analysis will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint using best available 
data (adjudicated events and site reported e ndpoints) based on data when approximately 60% 
of the total number of primary endpoint events is reached. The interim analysis will be based 
on a group sequential design that includes earl y stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_816592] I error rate (O’Brien-Flemi ng). This allows for interim analysis and 
preserves the overall Type I error probability of α=0.[ADDRESS_1130765] been observed. According to this boundary, the critical p-value at  the interim analysis 
has to be p<=0.0076, resulting in the final evaluation p-value of 0.0476.  
The interim results of the study will be mon itored by [CONTACT_45959]. The analyses 
will be performed by [CONTACT_816757] l group unblinded to the treatment assignment. 
The results will be reported only to the DS MB. The unblinded information will not be 
released to sponsor under a ny circumstance before the completion of the study. Specific 
statistical guidelines for data monitoring will be discussed and formalized in a separate 
Interim Statistical Analysis Plan and DSMB Charter. 
12.2.5. Analysis of Safety 
All analyses of safety will be conducted on the safety population, which is defined as all 
randomized patients who receive at least one dose of study drug. The safety assessment will 
be based on the frequency of adverse events , physical exams, vita l signs and safety 
laboratory tests. 
Adverse events with new onset during the study between the initia tion of study drug and 
[ADDRESS_1130766] dose of study drug for each patient will be considered treatment-
emergent (TEAEs). This will include any AE with onset prior to initiation of study drug and 
increased severity after the treatment initiation. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_72065], and by [CONTACT_3148]. This will include overall incidence rates (regardless of severity and relationship to study drug), and incidence rate s for moderate or severe adverse events. A 
summary of SAEs, and adverse events leading to early discontinuation from the study will be 
presented through data listings. 
Safety laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_447]-treatment change from 
baseline for each of the parameters using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_1570]. Those 
patients with significant laboratory abnorma lities will be identified in data listings. 
Additional safety parameters will be summarized in data listings. 
12.3. Sample Size Determination 
Sample size estimation is based on the assumpti on that the primary composite endpoint (time 
from randomization to the first occurrence of  CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, 
coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916]) event rate by 4 years 
would be relatively reduced by 15%, from an ev ent rate by 4 years of  23.6% in the placebo 
group to 20.5% in the AMR101 group. It is expected that a minimum of [ADDRESS_1130767]  this difference at 4.76% significance level 
(because of the interim analysis described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and with 90% power, 
assuming an 18-month enrollment period and a median follow-up of 4 years. The current sample size calculation is based on an estimat ed placebo yearly even t rate of 5.9% (23.6% 
over 4 years). To protect against the possibility  that the actual placebo event rate is lower 
than estimated, an extra 1000 patients will be enrolled (approximately 7990 patients in total). 
By [CONTACT_816720] 1000 patients, the event ra te in the placebo group could be 5.2% per year 
(20.8% over 4 years) without having to m odify the other sample size assumptions. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130768] be 
made available to the Sponsor and/or its designee. 
13.2. Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_816593], originals or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_222497], relati ng to the conduct of this trial, and necessary for the evaluation and 
reconstruction of the clinical trial. This documentation includes, but is not limited to 
protocol, CRFs, AE reports, patie nt source data (including record s of patients, patient visit 
logs, clinical observations and findings), corr espondence with health authorities and IRB, 
consent forms, inventory of study product, Investig ator’s curriculum vitae, monitor visit logs, 
laboratory reference ranges and laboratory certification or qu ality control procedures, and 
laboratory director curriculum vitae. 
The Investigator and affiliated institution shoul d maintain the trial documents as required by 
[CONTACT_1729]. The Investigator a nd affiliated institution should take measures to 
prevent accidental or premature destruction of documents. Clinical trial documents must be 
kept in the clinical site’s archives indefinite ly, unless written authori zation is obtained from 
the Sponsor. 
14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 
The investigator and research institution agree that the Spons or, their representatives and 
designees, the IRB or IEC, and representatives from worldwide regulatory agencies will have 
the right, both during and after the clinical trial, to review and inspect pertinent medical 
records related to the clinical trial.  
15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
The Sponsor and/or its designee(s), will perfor m quality control and quality assurance checks 
of all clinical trials that it sponsors. Before  the enrollment of any patient in this study, the 
Sponsor or its designee will review with the investigator and site personnel the following 
documents: protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, CRFs and procedures for their completion, the 
informed consent process, and the procedur e for reporting SAEs. Site visits will be 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130769] 2011 Page 68 of 98 performed by [CONTACT_1052]/or its designees. During these visits, information recorded on 
the CRFs will be verified against source documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the CRF data is  entered by [CONTACT_779], the Sponsor or designee 
will review for safety information, comple teness, accuracy, and logical consistency. 
Computer programs that identify data incons istencies may be used to help monitor the 
clinical trial. If necessary, requests for clarifica tion or correction will be sent to investigators. 
By [CONTACT_12142], the S ponsor agrees directly or th rough its designee(s) to be 
responsible for implementing and maintaining qu ality control and qual ity assurance systems 
with written standard operating procedures to ensure that tria ls are conducted and data are 
generated, documented, and reported in complian ce with the protocol, accepted standards of 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP),  International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and other 
applicable regulations. 
16. ETHICS AND GOOD CLINICAL  PRACTICE COMPLIANCE 
Good Clinical Practice is  an international ethical and sc ientific quality standard for 
designing, conducting, recording, and reporting trials that involve human patients. 
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well 
being of trial patients are protec ted, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and that  the clinical trial data are credible. In this study, the 2008 
version of the Declaration of Helsinki will be  adhered to. It can be found on the website of 
The World Medical Association: 
http://www.wma.net/en/30public ations/10policies/b3/17c.pdf
 
17. INFORMED CONSENT 
Prior to participation in a study, the participant, or participant’s legal representative must sign 
an IRB/IEC-approved written informed consen t form (ICF). The approved written informed 
consent must abide to all applicable laws in re gards to the safety and confidentiality of the 
patients. To obtain and document informed cons ent, the Investigator should comply with 
applicable regulations; adhere to  GCP standards and the ethical principles in the Declaration 
of Helsinki (see Section 16). The language in the oral and written informa tion about the trial, including the written 
informed consent form should be as non-techni cal as practical and should be understandable 
to the participant or participant’s legal representative and the impartial witness, where 
applicable. Before informed consent is obt ained, the Investigator  should provide the 
participant, or partic ipant’s legal representa tive ample time and opportun ity to inquire about 
the trial and to decide whet her or not to participate. 
All questions about the trial should be answered to the satisfaction of th e participant, or the 
participant’s legal representa tive. The written ICF should be  signed and personally dated by 
[CONTACT_82976]’s legal repr esentative, and by [CONTACT_16994]. Participants will be informed that participation is voluntary and that he/she can withdraw from the study at a ny time. A signed copy of the consent form must 
be given to the participant, and this fact will be documented in the CRF. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130770] 2011 Page 69 of 98 Of special concern regarding informed consent is the collection of blood samples for genetic 
analysis. Local regulations may not allow the co llection of blood samples for genetic testing 
or the shipment of blood samples for genetic te sting outside the region. In these cases, blood 
samples for genetic testing will not be collected, and the portion of the ICF describing the 
genetic component of the study will not be incl uded. If blood samples for genetic testing will 
be collected, the ICF will clea rly indicate that a sample will be drawn for this purpose, but 
that the participant has the right to refuse this procedure. 
18. PUBLICATION POLICY  
The Steering Committee (SC) is responsible fo r the reporting and pub lication of the study 
results. All decisions regardi ng the use of study data for publ ic presentation, and publication 
including issues of authorship must be appr oved by [CONTACT_1034]. The results of the study will 
be published irrespective of whether the endpoi nts are met, or whether the results are 
regarded positive or negative. 
Confidentiality, publication, and patent appl ications related to unpublished study-related 
information and unpublished information given to the investigator by [CONTACT_3433] e Sponsor and/or its 
designee(s) shall be handled as set fo rth in the Clinical Trial Agreement. 
19. FINANCING AND INSURANCE 
19.1. Finances 
Prior to starting the study, the Principal Inves tigator and/or institution will sign a Clinical 
Trial Agreement with the Sponsor and/or its designee(s). This agreement will include the 
financial information agreed upon by [CONTACT_46954]. 
19.2. Insurance Compensation 
The Sponsor certifies that it has taken out a li ability insurance policy covering all clinical 
trials under its sponsorship. Th is insurance policy is in a ccordance with local laws and 
requirements. The insurance of the Sponsor doe s not relieve the inves tigator and the other 
collaborators from maintaining their own liabi lity insurance policy. An insurance certificate 
will be provided to the IRB/IEC and Competen t Authority according to country specific 
regulatory requirements. 
20. COMPLETION OF STUDY 
The end of the study will be at the time of the last patient-last visit of the follow-up period of 
the study. The IRB and IEC will be notified about the end of the study according to country-specific regulatory requirements. 
21. STUDY ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION 
21.1. Protocol Amendments 
Any amendments to the study protocol consider ed to be a substantial amendment will be 
communicated to the investigator by [CONTACT_39987]. All substantial protocol 
amendments will undergo the same review and a pproval process as the original protocol and 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130771] 2011 Page 70 of 98 may be implemented after it has been approve d by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and Competent Authority  , 
unless immediate implementation of the change is  necessary for patient safety. In this case, 
the situation must be documented and reporte d to the IRB/IEC and Competent Authority 
according to all relevant country-specific regulatory requirements. 
A protocol amendment is considered to be a substantial amendment if it is likely to affect the 
safety, physical, or mental integrity of patients in the study; the scientific value of the study; 
the conduct or management of th e study; or the quality or safety of any IMP used in the 
study. 
Any other minor changes to the protocol not co nsidered to be substantial amendments will 
not need prior approval of the IRB/IEC and Competent Authority and will be communicated 
to the investigator by [CONTACT_4885].

EVENTS IN CARDIOVASCULAR TRIALS

DEFINITION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH  
  
Cardiovascular death  includes death resulting from an acute myocardial infarction, sudden 
cardiac death, death due to heart failure, death due to stroke, and death due to other 
cardiovascular causes, as follows:  
  
1. Death due to Acute Myocardial Infarction refers to a death by [CONTACT_816767]  
(arrhythmia, heart failure, low output) within 30 days after a myocardial infarction (MI) 
related to the immediate consequences of the myocardial infarction, such as progressive 
congestive heart failure (CHF), inadequate cardiac output, or recalcitrant arrhythmia.  If these 
events occur after a “break” (e.g., a CHF and arrhythmia free period of at least a week), they should be designated by [CONTACT_816768], even though the MI may have increased the 
risk of that event (e.g., late arrhythmic death becomes more likely after an acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI)).  The acute myocardial infarction should be verified to the extent possible 
by [CONTACT_816769].  Sudden cardiac death, if accompanied by [CONTACT_816770], new ST elevation, new 
LBBB, or evidence of fresh thrombus by [CONTACT_361910]/or at autopsy should be 
considered death resulting from an acute myocardial infarction, even if death occurs before 
blood samples or 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) could be obtained, or at a time before the 
appearance of cardiac biomarkers in the blood.  
 
Death resulting from a procedure to treat a myocardial infarction (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery by[CONTACT_10956] (CABG), or to treat a complication 
resulting from myocardial infarction, should also be considered death due to acute MI.    
  Death resulting from a procedure to treat myocardial ischemia (angina) or death due to a 
myocardial infarction that occurs as a direct consequence of a cardiovascular 
investigation/procedure/operation should be considered as a death due to other cardiovascular 
causes.  
 
2. Sudden Cardiac Death  refers to a death that occurs unexpectedly, not following an acute 
AMI, and includes the following deaths:  
a. Death witnessed and instantaneous without new or worsening symptoms  
b. Death witnessed within [ADDRESS_1130786] AMI  
c. Death witnessed and attributed to an identified arrhythmia (e.g., captured on an 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130787] 2011 Page 80 of 98 
 electrocardiographic (ECG) recording, witnessed on a monitor, or unwitnessed but found 
on implantable cardioverter-defibrillator review)  
d. Death after unsuccessful resuscitation from cardiac arrest  
e. Death after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest and without identification of a non-
cardiac etiology (Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome)  
f. Unwitnessed death without other cause of death (information regarding the patient’s 
clinical status preceding death should be provided, if available)  
General Considerations  
 
o A subject seen alive and clinically stable 12-24 hours prior to being found dead without any evidence or information of a specific cause of death should be classified as “sudden cardiac death.”  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_816597]  
• Subject well the previous day but found dead in bed the next day  
• Subject found dead at home on the couch with the television on  
 
o Deaths for which there is no information beyond “Patient found dead at home” may be 
classified as “death due to other cardiovascular causes” or in some trials, “undetermined 
cause of death.”  Please see Definition of Undetermined Cause of Death, for full details.  
 
3. Death due to Heart Failure or Cardiogenic Shock refers to a death occurring in the  
context of clinically worsening symptoms and/or signs of heart failure (see Definition of 
Heart Failure Requiring Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) without evidence of another cause of death and not 
following an AMI.  Note that deaths due to heart failure can have various etiologies, 
including one or more AMIs (late effect), ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, or 
valve disease.  
 
Death due to Heart Failure or Cardiogenic shock should include sudden death occurring during an admission for worsening heart failure as well as death from progressive heart 
failure or cardiogenic shock following implantation of a mechanical assist device.  
  New or worsening signs and/or symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) include any of 
the following:  
a. New or increasing symptoms and/or signs of heart failure requiring the initiation of, or an 
increase in, treatment directed at heart failure or occurring in a patient already receiving 
maximal therapy for heart failure  
b. Heart failure symptoms or signs requiring continuous intravenous therapy or chronic 
oxygen administration for hypoxia due to pulmonary edema  
c. Confinement to bed predominantly due to heart failure symptoms  
d. Pulmonary edema sufficient to cause tachypnea and distress not occurring in the context of 
an acute myocardial infarction, worsening renal function, or as the consequence of an 
arrhythmia occurring in the absence of worsening heart failure  
e. Cardiogenic shock not occurring in the context of an acute myocardial infarction or as the 
consequence of an arrhythmia occurring in the absence of worsening heart failure  
 Cardiogenic shock is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) < [ADDRESS_1130788] 2011 Page 81 of 98 
 1 hour, not responsive to fluid resuscitation and/or heart rate correction, and felt to be 
secondary to cardiac dysfunction and associated with at least one of the following signs of 
hypoperfusion:  
•  Cool, clammy skin or  
•  Oliguria (urine output < 30 mL/hour) or  
•  Altered sensorium or   
•  Cardiac index < 2.2 L/min/m 2  
Cardiogenic shock can also be defined if SBP < 90 mm Hg and increases to ≥ 90 mm Hg 
in less than 1 hour with positive inotropic or vasopressor agents alone and/or with mechanical support.  
  
General Considerations 
 
 
Heart failure may have a number of underlying causes, including acute or chronic 
ischemia, structural heart disease (e.g. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), and valvular heart 
disease.  Where treatments are likely to have specific effects, and it is likely to be possible to distinguish between the various causes, then it may be reasonable to separate 
out the relevant treatment effects.  For example, obesity drugs such as fenfluramine 
(pondimin) and dexfenfluramine (redux) were found to be associated with the 
development of valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension.  In other cases, the 
aggregation implied by [CONTACT_816771].  
  
4. Death due to Stroke  refers to death occurring up to 30 days after a stroke that is either due  
to the stroke or caused by a complication of the stroke.   
 
5. Death due to Other Cardiovascular Causes  refers to a cardiovascular death not included in 
the above categories (e.g. dysrhythmia unrelated to sudden cardiac death, pulmonary 
embolism, cardiovascular intervention (other than one related to an AMI), aortic aneurysm 
rupture, or peripheral arterial disease).  Mortal complications of cardiac surgery or non-
surgical revascularization should be cl assified as cardiovascular deaths.  
 
DEFINITION OF NON-CAR DIOVASCULAR DEATH  
  Non-cardiovascular death  is defined as any death that is not thought to be due to a 
cardiovascular cause.  Detailed recommendations on the classification of non-cardiovascular 
causes of death are beyond the scope of this document.  The level of detail required and the 
optimum classification will depend on the nature of the study population and the anticipated 
number and type of non-cardiovascular deaths.  Any specific anticipated safety concern should 
be included as a separate cause of death.  The following is a suggested list of non-cardiovascular* 
causes of death:    
Non-Malignant Causes 
 
•  Pulmonary  
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130789] 2011 Page 82 of 98 
 •  Renal  
•  Gastrointestinal  
•  Hepatobiliary  
•  Pancreatic  
•  Infection (includes sepsis)  
•  Non-infectious (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS))  
•  Hemorrhage, not intracranial  
•  Non-cardiovascular system organ failure (e.g., hepatic failure)  
•  Non-cardiovascular surgery  
•  Other non-cardiovascular  
•  Accidental/Trauma  
•  Suicide  
•  Drug Overdose  
 
*Death due to a gastrointestinal bleed should not be considered a cardiovascular death.  
 
Malignant Causes  
Malignancy should be coded as the cause of death if:  
•  Death results directly from the cancer; or  
•  Death results from a complication of the cancer (e.g. infection, complication of surgery / 
chemotherapy / radiotherapy); or  
•  Death results from withdrawal of other therap ies because of concerns relating to the poor 
prognosis associated with the cancer  
 
Cancer deaths may arise from cancers that were present prior to randomization or which 
developed subsequently.  It may be helpful to distinguish these two scenarios (i.e. worsening of prior malignancy; new malignancy).  
  
Suggested categorization includes common organ systems, hematologic, or unknown.  
 
DEFINITION OF UNDETERMINED CAUSE OF DEATH 
  Undetermined Cause of Death refers to a death not attributable to one of the above categories 
of cardiovascular death or to a non-cardiovascular cause.  Inability to classify the cause of death 
may be due to lack of information (e.g., the only available information is “patient died”) or when 
there is insufficient supporting information or detail to assign the cause of death.  In general, the 
use of this category of death should be discouraged and should apply to a minimal number of patients in well-run clinical trials.  
  
A common analytic approach for cause of death analyses is to assume that all undetermined cases 
are included in the cardiovascular category (e.g., presumed cardiovascular death, specifically 
“death due to other cardiovascular causes”).  Nevertheless, the appropriate classification and analysis of undetermined causes of death depends on the population, the intervention under 
investigation, and the disease process.  The approach should be prespecified and described in the 
protocol and other trial documentation such as the end point adjudication procedures and/or the 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130790] 2011 Page 83 of 98 
 statistical analysis plan.  
 
DEFINITION OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION  
  
1. General Considerations  
  
The term myocardial infarction (MI) should be used when there is evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consis tent with myocardial ischemia.  
  In general, the diagnosis of MI requires the combination of:  
•  Evidence of myocardial necrosis (either changes in cardiac biomarkers or post-
mortem pathological findings); and  
•  Supporting information derived from the clinical presentation, electrocardiographic 
changes, or the results of myocardial or coronary artery imaging  
 The totality of the clinical, electrocardiographic, and cardiac biomarker information should be considered to determine whether or not a MI has occurred.  Specifically, timing and trends in 
cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiographic information require careful analysis.  The 
adjudication of MI should also take into account the clinical setting in which the event occurs.  
MI may be adjudicated for an event that has characteristics of a MI but which does not meet the 
strict definition because biomarker or electrocardiographic results are not available.    
2. Criteria for Myocardial Infarction  
  
a. Clinical Presentation  
The clinical presentation should be consistent  with diagnosis of myocardial ischemia 
and infarction.  Other findings that might support the diagnosis of MI should be taken 
into account because a number of conditions are associated with elevations in cardiac 
biomarkers (e.g., trauma, surgery, pacing, ablation, congestive heart failure, 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, severe pulmonary hypertension, 
stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage, infiltrative and inflammatory disorders of cardiac muscle, drug toxicity, burns, critical illness, extreme exertion, and chronic kidney 
disease).  Supporting information can also be considered from myocardial imaging and 
coronary imaging.  The totality of the data may help differentiate acute MI from the 
background disease process.  
 
b. Biomarker Elevations  
For cardiac biomarkers, laboratories should report an upper reference limit (URL).  If 
the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit (URL) from the respective laboratory 
performing the assay is not available, then the URL for myocardial necrosis from the 
laboratory should be used.  If the 99th percentile of the URL or the URL for myocardial necrosis is not available, the MI decision limit for the particular laboratory should be 
used as the URL.  Laboratories can also report both the 99th percentile of the upper 
reference limit and the MI decision limit.  Reference limits from the laboratory 
performing the assay are preferred over the manufacturer’s listed reference limits in an 
assay’s instructions for use.  CK-MB and troponin are preferred, but CK may be used in 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130791] 2011 Page 84 of 98 
 the absence of CK-MB and troponin.  
 
For MI subtypes, different biomarker elevations for CK, CK-MB, or troponin will be 
required.  The specific criteria will be referenced to the URL.  
  
In many studies, particularly those in which patients present acutely to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816598], it is not practical to stipulate the use of a single biomarker or 
assay, and the locally available results are to be used as the basis for adjudication.  
However, if possible, using the same cardiac biomarker assay and preferably, a core 
laboratory, for all measurements reduces inter-assay variability.  
  
Since the prognostic significance of different types of myocardial infarctions (e.g., periprocedural myocardial infarction versus spontaneous myocardial infarction) may be 
different, consider evaluating outcomes for these subsets of patients separately.  
  
c. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Changes  
Electrocardiographic changes can be used to support or confirm a MI.  Supporting 
evidence may be ischemic changes and confirmatory information may be new Q waves.  
  
• Criteria for acute myocardial ischemia (in absence of left ventricular 
hypertrophy (LVH) and left bu ndle branch block (LBBB)):  
 
o ST elevation  
New ST elevation at the J point in two anatomically contiguous leads with the 
cut-off points:  ≥ 0.2 mV in men (> 0.25 mV in men < 40 years) or ≥ 0.15 mV in 
women in leads V2-V3 and/or ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_1130792] depression ≥ 0.05 mV in two contiguous 
leads; and/or new T inversion ≥ 0.1 mV in two contiguous leads.  
  
 
The above ECG criteria illustrate patterns consistent with myocardial ischemia.  In 
patients with abnormal biomarkers, it is recognized that lesser ECG abnormalities may represent an ischemic response and may be accepted under the category of abnormal 
ECG findings.  
  
• Criteria for pathological Q-wave  
  
o Any Q-wave in leads V2-V3 ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_1130793] ≥ 0.03 seconds and ≥ 0.1 mV deep or QS complex in leads I, II, aVL, 
aVF, or V4-V6 in any two leads of a contiguous lead groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (I, aVL, V6;  V4-
V6; II, III, and aVF)
a   
 
aThe same criteria are used for supplemental leads V7-V9, and for the Cabrera 
frontal plane lead groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
•  Criteria for Prior Myocardial Infarction  
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130794] ≥  0.04 seconds in V1-V2 and R/S ≥ [ADDRESS_1130795]  
 
3. Myocardial Infarction Subtypes 
Several MI subtypes are commonly reported in clinical investigations and each are defined 
below:  
 
a. Spontaneous MI

•  ECG evidence of acute myocardial ischemia  
•  New pathological Q waves  
•  Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall 
motion abnormality  
•  Autopsy evidence of acute MI  
 
2. If biomarkers are elevated from a prior infarction, then a spontaneous myocardial 
infarction is defined as:  
a. One of the following:

o Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion 
abnormality

hours apart) prior to the suspected MI*  
o ≥ 20% increase (and > URL) in troponin or CK-MB between a measurement made 
at the time of the initial presentation and a further sample taken 3-6 hours later  
*If biomarkers are increasing or peak is not reached, then a definite diagnosis of recurrent MI is generally not possible.

 b. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention-Related Myocardial Infarction  
Peri-PCI MI is defined by [CONTACT_28782].  Symptoms of cardiac ischemia are not 
required.  
  
1. Biomarker elevations within 48 hours of PCI:  
• Troponin or CK-MB (preferred) > 3 x URL and  
• No evidence that cardiac biomarkers were elevated prior to the procedure;  
OR  
• Both of the following must be true:  
o ≥ 50%1 increase in the cardiac biomarker result  
o Evidence that cardiac biomarker values were decreasing (e.g., two samples  3-6 
hours apart) prior to the suspected MI  
2. New pathological Q waves   
3. Autopsy evidence of acute MI  
 
c. Coronary Artery By[CONTACT_137870]-Related Myocardial Infarction  
 
Peri-coronary artery by[CONTACT_10956] (CABG) MI is defined by [CONTACT_4868].  
Symptoms of cardiac ischemia are not required.  
  
1.  Biomarker elevations within 72 hours of CABG:  
• Troponin or CK-MB (preferred) > 5 x URL and  
• No evidence that cardiac biomarkers were elevated prior to the procedure;   
 
OR  
• Both of the following must be true:  
o ≥ 50%2 increase in the cardiac biomarker result  
o Evidence that cardiac biomarker values were decreasing (e.g., two samples  3-6 
hours apart) prior to the suspected MI.  
 
AND  
 
2. One of the following:  
•  New pathological Q-waves persistent through 30 days  
•  New persistent non-rate-related LBBB  
•  Angiographically documented new graft or native coronary artery occlusion  
•  Other complication in the operating room resulting in loss of myocardium  
•  Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium

Silent MI is defined by [CONTACT_716]:  
  
1. No evidence of acute myocardial infarction  
 
AND

•  New pathological Q-waves.  A confirmatory ECG is recommended if there have been 
no clinical symptoms or history of myocardial infarction.  
•  Imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract, in the absence of a non-ischemic cause  
•  Autopsy evidence of a healed or healing MI  
 
COMMON CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES FOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION 
CATEGORIES   
  
For some trials, categorization of MI end points may be helpful or necessary using one or more 
of the classification schemes below:  
  
1.  By [CONTACT_816772]:  
 
a. Clinical Classification of Different Types of Myocardial Infarction  
 
•  Type 1  
Spontaneous myocardial infarction related to ischemia due to a primary coronary 
event such as plaque erosion and/or rupture, fissuring, or dissection  
•  Type 2

[CONTACT_816773]/or at autopsy, but de ath occurring before blood samples could 
be obtained, or at a time before the appearance of cardiac biomarkers in the blood  
• Type 4a

DEFINITION OF HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_816600]   
  1.  Symptoms of myocardial ischemia at rest (chest pain or equivalent) or an accelerating 
pattern  of angina with frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_816601] 
 
  
2.  Prompting an unscheduled visit to a healthcare facility and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (including chest 
pain observation units) within [ADDRESS_1130802] one of the following: 
 
a. New or worsening ST or T wave changes on resting ECG  
•  ST elevation  
New ST elevation at the J point in two anatomically contiguous leads with the cut-off 
points:  ≥  0.2 mV in men (> 0.25 mV in men < 40 years) or ≥ 0.15 mV in women in 
leads V2-V3 and/or ≥ 0.1 mV in other leads.  
  
•  ST depression and T-wave changes  
New horizontal or down-slopi[INVESTIGATOR_345482] ≥ 0.05 mV in two contiguous leads; 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130803] 2011 Page 90 of 98 
 and/or new T inversion ≥ 0.1 mV in two contiguous leads.  
  
The above ECG criteria illustrate patterns consistent with myocardial ischemia.  It is 
recognized that lesser ECG abnormalities may represent an ischemic response and may 
be accepted under the category of abnormal ECG findings.  
 
b. Definite evidence of myocardial ischemia on myocardial scintigraphy (clear reversible 
perfusion defect), stress echocardiography (reversible wall motion abnormality), or MRI 
(myocardial perfusion deficit under pharmacologic stress) that is believed to be 
responsible for the myocardial ischemic symptoms/signs  
 
c. Angiographic evidence of ≥ 70% lesion and/or thrombus in an epi[INVESTIGATOR_816602]/signs  
 d. Need for coronary revascularization procedure (PCI or CABG) during the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210].  This criterion would be fulfilled if the admission for myocardial ischemia led to 
transfer to another institution for the revascularization procedure without interceding 
home discharge  
 
AND 
 
 
4. No evidence of acute myocardial infarction 
 
General Considerations  
  
1. Escalation of pharmacotherapy for ischemia, such as intravenous nitrates or increasing  
dosages of β -blockers, should be considered supportive of the diagnosis of unstable angina.  
However, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_816603], without any of the additional findings listed under category 3, would be 
insufficient alone to support classification as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929].  
 2. If subjects are admitted with suspected unstable angina, and subsequent testing reveals a non-  
cardiac or non-ischemic etiology, this event should not be recorded as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929].  Potential ischemic events meeting the criteria for myocardial infarction 
should not be adjudicated as unstable angina.    
3. Planned rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_816604] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34104].  For example, a patient with stable exertional angina whose admission for coronary 
angiography and PCI is prompted by a positive out patient stress test should not be considered 
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929].  
 4. A patient who undergoes an elective catheterization where incidental coronary artery disease 
is found and who subsequently undergoes coronary revascularization will not be considered 
as meeting the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816605].   
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130804] 2011 Page 91 of 98 
 DEFINITION OF TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK AND STROKE  
 Transient Ischemic Attack  
  
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as  a transient epi[INVESTIGATOR_513435], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retinal ischemia, without  acute infarction.  
  
Stroke  
  
Stroke is defined as an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_816606], 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retinal vascular injury.    
Classification:  
  
A. Ischemic Stroke  
  
Ischemic stroke is defined as an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_196545], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], or retinal 
dysfunction caused by [CONTACT_196594].  
  
Hemorrhage may be a consequence of ischemic stroke.  In this situation, the stroke is an 
ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation and not a hemorrhagic stroke.  
 
B. Hemorrhagic Stroke  
  
Hemorrhagic stroke is defined as an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_816607] a nontraumatic intraparenchymal, intraventricular, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.  
 
C. Undetermined Stroke  
  Undetermined stroke is defined as a stroke with insufficient information to allow categorization as A or B.  
 
2. Stroke Disability  
  
Stroke disability should be measured by a reliable and valid scale in all cases.  For example, 
the modified Rankin Scale may be used to address this requirement:    
 
Scale Disability 
0 No symptoms at all 
1 No significant disability despi[INVESTIGATOR_5119]; able to carry out all usual duties and 
activities 
2 Slight disability; requiring some hel p, but able to walk without assistance 
3 Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance 
4 Moderate severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend 
to own  bodily needs without assistance 
5 Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and 
attention 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130805] 2011 Page 92 of 98 
 6 Dead 
 
 
Additional Considerations  
  
In trials involving patients with stroke, evidence of vascular central nervous system injury 
without recognized neurological dysfunction may be observed.  Examples include microhemorrhage, silent infarction, and silent hemorrhage.  When encountered, the clinical 
relevance of these findings may be unclear.  If appropriate for a given clinical trial, however, they 
should be precisely defined and categorized.  
  
The distinction between a Transient Ischemic Attack  and an Ischemic Stroke is the presence of 
infarction, not the transience of the symptoms.  In addition to laboratory documentation of 
infarction, persistence of symptoms is an acceptable indicator of infarction.  Thus, symptom 
transience should be defined for any clinical trial in which it will be used to distinguish between 
transient ischemia and infarction.  
 
DEFINITION OF HEART FAILURE REQUIRING HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_816608] (HF) requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816609]:  
  
a. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317082] a visit to an emergency 
department that results in at least a 24* hour stay (or a date change if the time of admission/discharge is not available).  
 
*For this end point in any given clinical trial, there should be some flexibility in the required 
duration of stay, depending on the population and the adverse event profile of the drug to be 
studied.  For example, a clinical trial studying patients with NYHA Class III/IV heart failure 
may not wish to capture hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816610] [ADDRESS_1130806] frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816611]-term therapy.  On the contrary, 
clinical trials in patients with NYHA Class I/II heart failure may wish to capture shorter 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816612].  
  
AND 
 
  
b. Clinical symptoms of heart failure, including at least one of the following: 
New or worsening  
•  dyspnea  
•  orthopnea  
•  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  
•  increasing fatigue/worsening exercise tolerance  
 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130807] two of the following:   
1.  edema (greater than 2+ lower extremity)  
2.  pulmonary crackles greater than basilar (pulmonary edema must be sufficient to cause 
tachypnea and distress not occurring in the context of an acute myocardial infarction or 
as the consequence of an arrhythmia occurring in the absence of worsening heart failure)  
3.  jugular venous distension   
4.  tachypnea (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] > 20 breaths/minute)  
5.  rapid weight gain  
6.  S3 gallop  
7.  increasing abdominal distension or ascites  
8.  hepatojugular reflux  
9.  radiological evidence of worsening heart failure  
10.  A right heart catheterization within 24 hours of admission showing a pulmonary 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469] (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) ≥ 18 mm Hg or a cardiac 
output  < 2.2 L/min/m2  
 
NOTE :  Biomarker results (e.g., brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)) consistent with congestive 
heart failure will be supportive of this diagnos is, but the elevation in BNP cannot be due to 
other conditions such as cor pulmonale, pulmonary embolus, primary pulmonary 
hypertension, or congenital heart disease.  In creasing levels of BNP, although not exceeding 
the ULN, may also be supportive of the diagnosis of congestive heart failure in selected cases (e.g. morbid obesity).    
AND 
 
  
d. Need for additional/increased therapy   
1. Initiation of, or an increase in, treatment directed at heart failure or occurring in a patient 
already receiving maximal therapy for heart failure and including at least one of the 
following:  
•  Initiation of or a significant augmentation in oral therapy for the treatment of 
congestive heart failure  
•  Initiation of intravenous diuretic, inotrope, or vasodilator therapy  
•  Uptitration of intravenous therapy, if already on therapy  
•  Initiation of mechanical or surgical intervention (mechanical circulatory support, 
heart transplantation or ventricular pacing to improve cardiac function), or the use of 
ultrafiltration, hemofiltration, or dialysis that  is specifically directed at treatment of 
heart failure.  
AND  
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130808] 2011 Page 94 of 98 
   
e. No other non-cardiac etiology (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic 
cirrhosis, acute renal failure, or venous insufficiency) and no other cardiac etiology (such as 
pulmonary embolus, cor pulmonale, primary pulmonary hypertension, or congenital heart 
disease) for signs or symptoms is identified.  
 
NOTE :  It is recognized that some patients may ha ve multiple simultaneous disease processes.  
Nevertheless, for the end point event of heart failure requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the diagnosis of 
congestive heart failure would need to be the primary disease process accounting for the above 
signs and symptoms.  
 
INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY DEFINITIONS  
  1.  Coronary Revascularization Procedure
:  A coronary revascularization procedure is a 
catheter-based or open surgical procedure designed to improve myocardial blood flow.  
Catheter-based tools (e.g., balloon catheters, cutting balloons, atherectomy devices, lasers, 
bare metal stents, and drug-eluting stents) improve myocardial blood flow by [CONTACT_816778] a site of an obstructive coronary  lesion.  By[CONTACT_250534] (arterial, venous, or 
synthetic) improve myocardial blood flow by [CONTACT_1541] a conduit for blood flow distal to an obstructive coronary lesion.  Insertion of a guidewire through a coronary guide catheter into a coronary vessel or by[CONTACT_816779] (PCI) 
is considered intention for PCI.  However, in the assessment of the severity of intermediate 
lesions with the use of intravascular ultrasound, Doppler flow velocity, or fractional flow 
reserve, insertion of a guidewire will NOT be considered PCI.  
 
2.  Procedural Success
:  Achievement of <30 % residual diameter stenosis of the target lesion 
assessed by [CONTACT_816780] (QCA) and no in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_478125] (MACE, a composite of death, MI, or repeat coronary 
revascularization of the target lesion).  Ideally, the assessment of the residual stenosis at the 
end of the procedure should be performed by [CONTACT_256911].  
  
Comment
:  For some devices or clinical settings (e.g., plain old balloon angioplasty 
(POBA) for patients undergoing non-cardiac su rgery), achievement of < 50% diameter 
stenosis by [CONTACT_816781].  
  
3. Elective and  Non-elective Procedures:   
  
Elective :  An elective procedure is one performed on a patient with stable cardiac function in 
the days or weeks prior to the procedure.  Elective cases are usually scheduled at least 1 day 
prior to the procedure.  
  
Non-Elective :  A non-elective procedure is one performed on a patient who has been 
stabilized following initial treatment of acute coronary ischemia, and there is clinical 
consensus that the procedure should occur within the next [ADDRESS_1130809] 2011 Page 95 of 98 
   
A procedure that is performed without delay on a patient with evidence of ongoing refractory 
ischemia with or without hemodynamic instability.  
 
4. Target Lesion:   A target lesion is any lesion treated or attempted to be treated during the 
trial procedure with the study device.  The target lesion is the treated segment starting 5 mm 
proximal and ending 5 mm distal to the study device (stent, in most cases).  
  5. Target Vessel:
  A target vessel is  any native coronary vessel (e.g., left main coronary artery  
(LMCA), left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), left circumflex coronary artery (LCX), or right coronary artery (RCA)) or by[CONTACT_816782], LCX, or RCA containing the target lesion.  The target vessel includes the target lesion as well as segments of the vessel 
that are upstream and downstream to the target lesion, including side branches (native 
vessel).  
 6. Non-Target Lesion
:  A non-target lesion is one for which revascularization is not attempted 
or one in which revascularization is performed using a non-study device.  
 7.  Non-Target Vessel
:  A non-target vessel is one for which revascularization is not attempted 
or one in which revascularization is performed using a non-study device.   
 
8.  Target Vessel, Non-Target Lesion :  Any lesion or revascularization of a lesion in the target 
vessel other than the target lesion.  
 
9.  Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR) :  Target lesion revascularization is any repeat  
percutaneous intervention of the target lesion (including 5 mm proximal and distal to the 
target lesion) or surgical by[CONTACT_816783].  In the assessment of TLR, angiograms should be 
assessed by [CONTACT_256911] (if designated) and made available to the Clinical End Points Committee (CEC) for review.  
 
10.  Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR)
:  Target vessel revascularization is any repeat  
percutaneous intervention or surgical by[CONTACT_256915].  In the assessment of TVR, angiograms should be assessed by [CONTACT_256911] (if designated) and made available to the CEC for review.  
 
11. Clinically-Driven Target Lesion Revascularization
:  Revascularization is clinically-driven 
if the subject has a target lesion diameter stenosis ≥ 50% by [CONTACT_816784].  Clinical or functional ischemia includes any of the following:   
 
a. A history of angina pectoris, presumably related to the target vessel  
b. Objective signs of ischemia at rest (ECG changes) or during exercise test (or equivalent), 
presumably related to the target vessel  
c. Abnormal results of any invasive functional diagnostic test (e.g., Doppler flow velocity 
reserve or fractional flow reserve (FFR))  
d. A diameter stenosis ≥70% by [CONTACT_816785].  
 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130810] 2011 Page 96 of 98 
 Comment:  In the absence of QCA data or if a < 50% stenosis is present, TLR may be 
considered clinically-driven by [CONTACT_816786] s evere ischemic signs and symptoms attributed 
to the target lesion are present.  
 
DEFINITION OF PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL REVASCULARIZATION 
PROCEDURE  
1. Peripheral Arterial Revascularization Procedure : A peripheral arterial revascularization  
procedure is a catheter-based or open surgical procedure designed to improve peripheral 
arterial blood flow. This procedure may include thrombectomy, embolectomy, atherectomy, dissection repair, angioplasty, and stent placement.   
 
The intention to perform percutaneous peripheral arterial intervention is denoted by [CONTACT_816787] a guidewire through a guide catheter into a peripheral artery.  
 
The target vessel(s) should be specified (e.g., aorta, renal, mesenteric, iliac, femoral, tibial) 
and recorded as well as the type of revascularization procedure (e.g., surgical, angioplasty, 
stent placement, thromboembolectomy). For simplicity, this definition applies to non-cardiac 
and non-cerebrovascular vessels, including the aorta, but does not address aortic aneurysm 
repair.  
 
2. Procedural Success : In the case of percutaneous intervention for obstructive lesions, 
procedural success is defined as the achievement of a final residual diameter stenosis < 30% by [CONTACT_576336] (and without flow limiting arterial dissection and 
hemodynamically significant translesional pressure gradient) without any in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816613] (death, acute onset of limb ischemia, need for urgent/emergent vascular 
surgery). The balloon inflation and/or stent placement may be preceded by [CONTACT_576337] (e.g., percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, directional or rotational atherectomy, 
laser, chronic total occlusion crossing device).  
 
3. Elective and Non-Elective Procedures
:  
 
Elective : An elective procedure is one that is scheduled and is performed on a patient with 
stable peripheral arterial disease.  
 
Non-Elective : A non-elective procedure is one performed on a patient who has been 
stabilized following initial treatment of acute peripheral limb ischemia, and there is clinical 
consensus that the procedure should occur within the next 24 hours.  
 
OR  
 
A procedure that is performed without delay because of urgency of the medical condition (e.g., acute limb ischemia, acute aortic dissection).  
 
4. Target Lesion : A target lesion is any lesion treated or attempted to be treated during the trial 
procedure with the index device. The target lesion is the treated segment starting 5 mm proximal and ending 5 mm distal to the index device (stent, in most cases).  
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-[ADDRESS_1130811] 2011 Page 97 of 98 
  
5. Target Vessel :  A target vessel is any vessel (e.g., non-cardiac or non-cerebrovascular 
vessel) that contains the target lesion treated with the study device.  The target vessel 
includes the target lesion as well as the entire vessel upstream and downstream to the target 
lesion, including side branches (native vessel).   
 
6. Non-Target Lesion :  A non-target lesion is one for which revascularization is not attempted 
or one in which revascularization is performed using a non-study device.  
 
7.  Non-Target Vessel :  A non-target vessel is one for which revascularization is not attempted  
or one in which revascularization is performed using a non-study device.   
8. Target Vessel, Non-Target Lesion
:  Any lesion or revascularization of a lesion in the target 
vessel other than the target lesion.  
 
9. Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR ):  Target lesion revascularization is any repeat  
percutaneous intervention of the target lesions (including 5 mm proximal and distal to the 
index device) or surgical by[CONTACT_816783].  In the assessment of TLR, angiograms should be 
assessed by [CONTACT_256911] (if designated) and made available to the 
Clinical End Points Committee (CEC) for review.  
 
10. Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR) :  Target vessel revascularization is any repeat  
percutaneous intervention or surgical by[CONTACT_256915].  In the 
assessment of TVR, angiograms should be assessed by [CONTACT_256911] (if 
designated) and made available to the CEC for review.  
 
11. Clinically-Driven Target Lesion Revascularization :  Clinically-driven target lesion  
revascularization is a target lesion revascularization prompted by [CONTACT_816788] (intermittent claudication, critical limb ischemia) or objective imaging evidence of 
target lesion restenosis (i.e., most commonly with duplex ultrasonography).  In the 
assessment of clinically driven TLR based on duplex ultrasonography, ultrasonographic 
images should be assessed by a duplex ultrasound core laboratory (if designated) and made 
available to the CEC for review.

OBJECTIVES: 
The primary objective is, in patients at LDL-C goal while on statin therapy, with established 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at high risk for CVD, and hypertri glyceridemia (fasting 
triglycerides, TG, 200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL [ 2.26 mmol/L and <5.64 mmol/L]), to 
evaluate the effect of 4 g/day AMR101 for preventing the occurrence of a first major 
cardiovascular event of the com posite endpoint that includes: 
 Cardiovascular (CV)  death, 
 Nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), 
 Nonfatal stroke, 
 Coronary revascularization,  
 Unstable angina determined to be caused  by [CONTACT_816789]/non-
invasive testing and requiri ng emergent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
The secondary objectives of this study are the following: 
The key secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of therapy on th e composite of death 
from CV causes, nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization, unstable angina determined to be caused by [CONTACT_816724]/ non-invasive testing and requiring emergent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nonfatal stroke , or peripheral CVD requiring intervention, angioplasty,

failure (CHF), on new CHF as a primary cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191], on transient 
ischemic attack, on amputation for vascular disease and on carotid revascularization; 
 Elective coronary revascularization and emergent corona ry revascularization;  
 To assess the effects regarding lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], lipoproteins and inflammatory markers including triglycerides (TG), total chol esterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C), high- density lipoprotein choles terol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, 
very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), high 
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) a nd high sensitivity troponin (hsTnT), as 
follows: 
o Assessment of the effect of AM R101 on each marker (on-treatment 
change of markers) 
o Assessment of the effect of the baseline value of each marker on 
treatment effects (baseline effect on outcomes) 
o To evaluate the effect of therapy for preventing clinical events, as 
defined above, among all patients in the study, and in subgroups such as 
patients with diabetes mellitus and pa tients with substantial on-treatment 
changes of any of the markers (on-treatment effect on outcomes). 
 To evaluate the effect of therapy on new onset diabetes (See appendix C); 
 To explore the effect of AMR101 on  weight and waist circumference.

POPULATION: 
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Fasting TG levels of 200 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L) and <500 mg/dL (5.64 mmol/L).

with a statin (with or wit hout ezetimibe) for at least 4 weeks prior to the LDL-C/TG 
baseline qualifying measurements for randomization  
 Stable therapy is defined as the same daily  dose of the same statin for at least 28 
days before the lipid qualification measurem ents (TG and LDL-C) and, if applicable, 
the same daily dose of ezetimibe for at le ast 28 days before the lipid qualification 
measurements (TG and LDL-C). Patients who have their statin therapy or use of 
ezetimibe initiated at Visit 1, or have thei r statin, statin dose and/or ezetimibe dose 
changed at Visit 1, will need to go through a stabilization period of at least 28 days 
since initiation/change and have their qua lifying lipid measurements measured (TG 
and LDL-C) after the washout  period (at Visit 1.1).  
 Statins may be administered with or without ezetimibe.   
NOTE: If patients qualify at the first qualific ation visit (Visit 1) fo r TG and LDL-C, and 
meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, th ey may be randomized at Visit 2. If patients 
do not qualify at the first qualifying visit (Visit  1), a second re-qualifyi ng visit (Visit 1.1) 
is allowed. For some patients, because they ne ed to stabilize medications and/or need to 
washout medications, the second re-qualifying vi sit (Visit 1.1) will be needed after the 
stabilization/washout period.

STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: 
This is a multi-center, multi-national, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study. 
This is an event-driven trial:  It is expected that a minimu m of [ADDRESS_1130827] occurred. 
Screening Period: 
During the screening period, patients will be evaluated for inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Patients will be eligible for randomization if th ey meet all the inclus ion/exclusion criteria. 
Prospectively, eligible patients with documen ted CVD or diabetes (with at least one 
additional risk factor for CVD) will undergo screen ing to establish suitability for inclusion in 
the trial. The qualifying lipid determination at Vis it [ADDRESS_1130828] 
a fasting TG level 200 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L) and <500 mg/dL (5.64 mmol/L) in order to 
enter the treatment/follow-up period of the trial (and they need to meet all other 
inclusion/exclusion criteria). These patients will be randomized at Visit 2, which will occur 
soon after Visit 1 (there will be no Visit 1.1 for these patients). 
Patients who do not qualify at Visit 1, may return to the Research Site for a second qualifying 
visit (Visit 1.1) at which time procedures that caused failure of eligibility at Visit [ADDRESS_1130829] Visit 1.1 to 
determine whether they qualify based on lip id level requirements (TG and LDL-C)

repeated at Visit 1.1. Details are listed in the main section of the protocol. 
Treatment/Follow-Up Period: 
At Visit 2 (Day 0), eligible patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to one of the following 
treatment groups: 
 AMR101 4 g daily, or 
 Placebo. 
Stratification will be by [CONTACT_816718] (estab lished CVD or the presence of diabetes with 
≥1 risk factor for CVD), use of ezetimibe and by [CONTACT_101820] (Westernized, Eastern 
European, and Asia Pacific countries). 
 
During the treatment/follow-up pe riod, patients will return to th e Research Site at regular 
intervals for efficacy and safety evaluations , and drug supply and compliance checks. The 
visits after the randomization visit (Visit 2; Da y 0) are scheduled for 4 months after Visit 2 
(for Visit 3); 8 months after Visit 3 (for Visit 4); and then every year thereafter. 
 
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUT E OF ADMINISTRATION: 
Eligible patients will be random ly assigned at Visit 2 to receive orally AMR101 4 g daily or 
matching placebo. AMR101 is provided in 1000 mg  liquid-filled, oblong, gelatin capsules. 
The matching placebo capsule is filled with lig ht liquid paraffin and contains 0 mg of 
AMR101. AMR101 or matching placebo capsules are to  be taken with food (i.e. with or at 
the end of a meal). 
 During the treatment period, the daily dose of study drug is 4 capsules per day taken as two 
capsules taken on two occasions per day (2 capsules given twice daily).  
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: 
 Intent-to-treat analysis. 
 Parameters will be summarized using mea n, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, and interquartile range for contin uous data and percentage for categorical 
data. 
 Survival analysis using the log-rank test for the primary efficacy outcome comparing the 
2 treatment groups (AMR101 and Placebo) and including the stratification factors CV 
risk category, use of ezetimibe and by [CONTACT_816719] (Westernized, Eastern 
European, and Asia Pacific countries). 
 All statistical analyses for the efficacy and safety outcomes will be performed at the 5% 
significance level using 2-sided tests unless otherwise noted. 
 One interim analysis is planned when approxi mately 60% of the planned total number of 
events has occurred.

Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 13 of 110 The analysis is planned to: 
 Describe at baseline: Patient characteristics, including lipi[INVESTIGATOR_6520], stroke 
history, cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome, among 
others. 
 Compare the primary, secondary, and tertiary endpoints between treatment groups at the 
corresponding follow-up time points. 
 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: 
Sample size estimation is based on the assumpti on that the primary composite endpoint (time 
from randomization to the first occurrence of  CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, 
coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916]) would be relatively 
reduced by 15%, from an event rate by 4 years of 23.6% in the placebo group to 20.5% in the 
AMR101 group. It is expected that a minimum of [ADDRESS_1130830] this difference at 4.76% significan ce level (decreased from 5.00% because of one 
interim analysis) and with 90% power, assu ming an 18-month enrollment period and a 
median follow-up of 4 years. The current samp le size calculation is based on an estimated 
placebo yearly event rate of 5.9% (23.6% over 4 y ears). To protect agains t the possibility that 
the actual placebo event rate is lower than estimated, an extra 1000 patients will be enrolled (approximately 7990 patients in tota l). By [CONTACT_816720] 1000 pa tients, the event rate in the 
placebo group could be 5.2% per year (20.8% over 4 years) w ithout having to modify the 
other sample size assumptions.   
Since this is an events-driven trial, the ‘sample size’ is the number of events rather than the 
number of patients. The number of events that occur depends pr imarily on three factors: how 
many patients are enrolled, the combined group event rate, and how long the patients are 
followed. Because of the difficulty in predicti ng the combined event rate, the sponsor will 
monitor that event rate as the trial progresses.  If the combined event rate is less than 
anticipated, either increasing th e number of patients, extending the length of follow-up, or a 
balance of adjusting both factors may be necessary to achieve the sample size of [ADDRESS_1130831] 1 adjudicated, primary event (and appropriately accounting for patients with potential primary events for which the 
adjudication process is then incomplete) is consistent with projecti ons, then the study could 
continue toward the protocol-spe cified target enrollment of 7 990 patients.  However, if the 
number of such events appears less than, and inconsistent with projections, the Sponsor will 
consider (under blinded conditions) re-calcula ting the number of patients needed to achieve 
the target number of events within the desire d timeline or extend the follow-up period.  If the 
projected increase in nu mber of patients is ≤ 25% of the original 7990 target population, the 
Sponsor may, with documented approval of both the REDUCE-IT Steering Committee and 
the Data Monitoring Committee, extend enrollme nt to the revised ta rget number without

investigators, ethics committees, and regulatory authorities associated with the protocol will 
be promptly notified of the action. Should the projected increase in number of patients be 
more than 25% above the original 7990 target ( i.e. more than 1998 additional patients) a 
formal protocol amendment will be initiated. 
 If the number of patients to be studied is in creased, the enrollment pha se will be extended to 
allow enrollment of the additional patients.  At completion of study enrollment, the actual nu mber of patients randomized may vary from 
the target number (either original  or revised) as a result of th e inherent lag between the date 
the last patient started sc reening and the date the la st patient was randomized.

Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 22 of 110 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
AMR101 (icosapent ethyl [ethyl-EPA]) is a hi ghly purified ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic 
acid (EPA) derived from fish oil, and is bei ng developed by [INVESTIGATOR_816571]. (hereafter 
referred to as Amarin or the Sponsor) for the treatment of hypertrigly ceridemia. The purpose 
of this study is to evaluate  whether the triglyce ride-lowering drug AMR101, combined with a 
statin therapy, will be superior to the statin  therapy alone, when used as a prevention in 
reducing long-term clinical events in patient s with mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816575] (CV) events. 
1.1. Background 
Since the initial observation of a link between fish oil consump tion and the reduced incidence 
of coronary heart disease in the Eskimos of  Greenland (Bang 1972), a large body of evidence 
has accumulated showing that regular intake of omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) exerts 
cardioprotective effects in both primary and secondary coronary heart disease prevention 
(Harris 2008, Lee 2008). Several mechanisms ha ve been proposed to account for these 
beneficial effects, including the reduction of tr iglycerides (TG), suppression of cardiac 
arrhythmias, decreased platelet aggregati on, improved plaque composition and stabilization, 
and hemodynamic changes. This mounting body of evidence has led the American Heart 
Association (AHA) to recommend the consumption of O3FAs in dietary fish or in capsule 
form at a dose of 1 g/day for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Kris-Etherton 2002). This recommendation has now been included in American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the long-term 
management of patients with stable angina and acute coronary syndromes (Antman 2004, Fraker 2007, Anderson 2007). 
A large number of studies have also demonstrat ed the triglyceride-low ering effects of O3FAs 
(Harris 1997, Ginsberg 2001). The US FDA has approved a product containing 
approximately 90% esters of the O3FAs EPA and DHA for use at a dose of 4 g/day as an 
adjunct to diet for the treatment of patie nts with very high triglyceride levels (≥ 500 mg/dL) 
(Lovaza
® USPI 2009). The same medicinal product under the name [CONTACT_816949]® (Omacor SPC 
2008) is approved in Europe for the treatment  of endogenous hypertrigl yceridemia at a dose 
of up to 4 grams daily as a supplement to diet when dietary measures al one are insufficient to 
produce an adequate response. Omacor® at a dose of 1 gram daily is also approved in key 
European and certain Asian markets for the se condary prevention of myocardial infarction 
(Post-MI). 
Epadel® capsules, which contain highly purified (>95%) ethyl-EPA, have been marketed by 
[CONTACT_816721] 1991 for the treatment of arterioscler osis obliterans and since 1994 
for the treatment of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (Epade l SPC 2007). The recommended dose is 1.8 g/day 
for arteriosclerosis obliterans and 1.8 to 2.7 g/day for hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. Hypertriglyceridemia 
is a feature of many dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] s and often occurs in person s who are obese and/or have 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus in isolation or as a component of the metabolic syndrome (Jacobson 
2007, Bays 2008). 
Elevation in TG confers dual risks of acute panc reatitis (most marked in patients with severe 
hypertriglyceridemia [TG >1500 mg/dL]) (Yad av 2003) and accelerated atherosclerosis 
leading to CV events, the latter even after correction for other lipid and non-lipid risk factors

Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 23 of 110 (Jacobson 2007). With this in mind, Amarin is assessing the potential of AMR101 capsules, 
which contain highly purified icosapent ethyl (et hyl-EPA), for the treatmen t of patients, as an 
adjunct to diet, with very high TG levels ( ≥500 mg/dL) and those with high TG levels ( ≥200 
and <500 mg/dL) despi[INVESTIGATOR_816576]. Amarin-sponsored studies with AMR101 in 
patients with very high TGs (Study AMR-01- 01-0016, the MARINE study) and in patients 
with high TGs on statins (Study AMR-01-01- 0017, the ANCHOR study) are in progress. 
1.2. Summary of Amarin-Sponsored Clinical Studies with AMR101 
To date, Amarin has completed 8 double-bli nd, placebo-controlled clinical trials with 
AMR101 in patients with CNS disorders in cluding Huntington’s disease, depression, 
schizophrenia and age-associated memory im pairment. Males and females were almost 
equally represented. The majority  of patients were Caucasian, but the studies also included, 
among the patients receiving AMR101, 14 Blacks, 6 Asians and 11 patients of another race.  
The patients received 0.5-4 g/day AMR101 or placebo. The duration of the double-blind treatment period ranged from [ADDRESS_1130842] 
received AMR101 2 g/day for up to 28 days  in a pharmacokinetic study (LA01.01.0009). In 
these studies, AMR101 was administered in the form of 500-mg soft gelatin capsules, orally with meals as a twice-daily regimen with half of  the daily dose in the morning and half in the 
evening. 
Across all 9 completed Amarin-spo nsored studies (1 in healthy volunteers and 8 in patients), 
a total of 1243 patients were randomized (24 h ealthy volunteers and 12 19 patients with CNS 
disorders). From the 1243 patients, 724 (24 healthy patients and 700 patients) were 
randomized to receive AMR101 and 519 to receive placebo. See the Investigator’s Brochure for more information. 
In 4 of the Amarin-sponsored studies in patients with CNS disorders, patients who completed 
the double-blind period were roll ed-over into an open-label ex tension phase and received 1-
2 g/day AMR101 (most received 2 g/day). The tr eatment period in the open-label extensions 
ranged from [ADDRESS_1130843] investigated the effi cacy of AMR101 in lowering triglycerides:

After a 6- to 8-week screeni ng period which included diet  and lifestyle stabilization, a 
washout period for excluded non-statin lipid-altering medications (if needed), and a TG 
qualifying period, patients were randomized to one of 3 treatment groups and received study 
medication during a 12-week, double-blind treatment period. Patients had to be treated with one of 3 statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin or  rosuvastatin) to reach  their LDL-C goal of 100 
mg/dL (+15% allowed for variability) and had to be on a stable dose for a minimum period of [ADDRESS_1130844] qualifying fasting TG levels of ≥200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL based on the 
mean of 2 measurements. During the 12-week double-blind treatment period, patients received orally AMR101 2 g/day, AMR101 4 g/day, or placebo. 
Patients were randomized to either 2 or 4 g/ day of AMR101 or placebo for 12 weeks.  The 
primary endpoint was the reduction in triglyceri de levels compared to placebo.  Secondary 
endpoints were percent change in LDL-C co mpared to placebo, non-HDL-C, apoB, LpPLA

and VLDL-C. The median placebo-adjusted changes in the major lipid parameters for the groups receiving

In a large study with Japanese patients (Japan  EPA Lipid Intervention Study [JELIS]), long-
term administration of 1. 8 g/day ethyl-EPA (Epadel®) was associated with an excellent safety 
and tolerability profile (Yokoyama 2007). Most AE s attributable to ethyl-EPA were regarded 
as mild. The most common adverse events were ga stro-intestinal (nausea, diarrhea, epi[INVESTIGATOR_258713]) or dermatologic (eruption, itching, exanthema, eczema) in nature. 
1.5. Rationale 
Hypothesis 
The hypothesis is that combin ation anti-dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816578] a LDL-C lowering drug 
(statin therapy) with the triglyceride-loweri ng drug AMR101 will be superior to the LDL-C 
lowering therapy alone when used as prevention  in reducing long-term clinical events in 
patients with mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816619]. 
TG-Lowering as a Therapeutic CV Target Studies have shown that elevated  levels of total cholesterol (T C) and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with incr eased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) 
(LaRosa 2003), and therapeutic strategies that le ad to a statistically significant reduction in 
LDL-C lower CHD event rates (Baigent 2005). One potential impediment, limiting further 
reduction in CHD events despi[INVESTIGATOR_816579]-treatmen t LDL-C, is residual elevation in serum TG 
levels (Miller 2000). Indeed, even after adju stment for HDL-C, detailed evaluation of 
population-based prospective studi es has disclosed an independent effect of TG on CHD 
events (Sarwar 2007). Coupled with the knowle dge that combined hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (i.e., 
elevated LDL-C and TG) promotes CHD to a si gnificantly greater extent than either high 
LDL-C or TG alone (Manninen 1992 ), the hypothesis is strong that low on-treatment levels 
of TG when added to low LDL-C would be superior to low LDL-C alone in reducing 
subsequent CHD events. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis was obtained in a post hoc 
analysis of the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Ev aluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In

event, the risk for d eath, myocardial infarction, or recu rrent acute coronary syndrome was

Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Fish Oils 
There is a growing body of evidence, encompa ssing molecular, cellular, animal and human 
studies defining the roles for O3 FAs as bioactive agents for re ducing the risks of and treating 
CVD (Torrejon 2007). Many epi[INVESTIGATOR_816580], and more specifically  between the intake and blood 
levels of O3FAs and CV mortality. For exam ple, when comparing blood levels of O3FAs 
among men who had died of sudden cardiac de ath with controls matched for age and 
smoking status, it was found that participants with the highest blood levels of EPA and DHA 
had a 90% risk reduction for sudden cardiac de ath compared with those with the lowest 
levels (Albert 2002). 
Clinical trials and experimental studies, suggest  important antiatheroge nic and antithrombotic 
effects of O3FAs. These result from wide-ra nging biological effects,  including benefits on 
lipoprotein metabolism, blood pressure, endot helial function and va scular reactivity, 
inflammation, platelet and fi brinolytic function, cytokine  production, coagulation and 
oxidative stress (Mori and Woodman 2006). Evid ence suggests that increased consumption 
of O3FAs from fish or fish-oil supplements re duces the rates of all- cause mortality, cardiac 
and sudden death, and possibly st roke (Wang 2006). The effect was evident in both primary-
prevention (general population without a histor y of CVD) and secondary -prevention (patients 
with a history of CVD) studies with a stronger effect in secondary prevention. 
The Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART) was on e of the first randomized, controlled studies 
to demonstrate the beneficial effects of O3FA s in secondary prevention of CHD and reported 
a 29% reduction in all-cause mortality over a 2-year peri od in 2033 male MI survivors 
advised to increase their intake  of oily fish (200 to 400 g of fatty fish per week, which 
provided 500 to 800 mg/day of O3FAs) (Burr 19 89). While not statistically significant, there 
was also a trend toward a reduction in recurrent ischemic heart disease events with increased 
fatty fish consumption. A post hoc analysis  of patients receiving fish oil capsules 
(900 mg/day of EPA+DHA) in DART suggested th at the protective effect  was attributable to 
O3FAs (Burr 1994). The greatest benefit was seen in fatal MIs, and this observation led to 
the hypothesis that O3FAs might protect the my ocardium against the adverse sequela of 
acute ischemic stress. 
A cardioprotective effect for O3FA s derived from fish oil is supported by [CONTACT_816723], 
especially amongst high-risk individuals (Mori and Woodma n 2006). Early separation of 
survival curves in the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell’Infarto 
Miocardico (GISSI)-Prevenzione study (GISSI-Prevenzione Investigators 1999) and the 
DART trial support a reduction in ventricular fibrillation and a decr eased incidence of

Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 28 of 110 myocardial infarction (Leaf 1996)  as the primary mechanisms through which O3FAs prevent 
CVD (Mori and Woodman 2006). 
Many international bodies including the AHA, American College of Cardiology, and the 
European Society of Cardiology have found th e overall evidence for benefit sufficiently 
strong to make public recommendations for in creased O3FA intake for both primary and 
secondary prevention (Harris 2007). 
Omega-[ADDRESS_1130846] the efficacy of O3FAs for 
secondary prevention of CHD is the GISSI study  (GISSI-Prevenzione In vestigators 1999). In 
this study, 11,324 patients with preexisting C HD (experienced an MI and were receiving 
conventional cardiac pharmacotherapy) were rand omized to either 300 mg of vitamin E, 
850 mg of O3FA ethyl esters (as EPA and DHA), both, or neithe r. After 3.5 years of follow-
up, the group given the O3FAs alone experience d a 15% reduction in the primary end point 
of death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke (p <0.02). There wa s a 20% reduction in all-cause 
mortality (p =0.01) and a 45% reduction in s udden death (p <0.001) compared with the 
control group; vitamin E provided no additiona l benefit. Triglycerides decreased by 4% and 
LDL cholesterol levels increased by 2.5% afte r six months in the O3FA treatment groups 
compared with controls. This trial, although very  large and carried out in a relatively "usual-
care" setting, was not placebo controlled, and dropout rates were high (>25%). A follow-up 
study (Marchioli 2002) assessed the time-course of the benefit of O3FAs on mortality in 
subjects in the GISSI-P Study and found that  survival curves diverged early after 
randomization. Total mortality was significantly lowered by 28% after 3 months of treatment 
(RR =0.59), and by 4 months, the risk of  sudden cardiac death was reduced by 45% 
(RR =0.47). 
Ethyl-EPA 
In another larger trial, the Japan EPA Lipi d Intervention Study (JELI S), 18,645 patients with 
hypercholesterolemia (70% women; mean age, 61  years) were randomly assigned to either 
statin alone or statin and pur e ethyl-EPA (1.8 g/day). Of all patients, 15,000 patients (80%) 
were without existing CAD and 3,645 (20%) with existing CAD (Matsuzaki 2009). The 
primary endpoint was any major adverse corona ry event (MACE including SCD, fatal and 
nonfatal MI, and other nonfatal events including unstable angina pectoris (determined to be 
caused by [CONTACT_816724]/non-i nvasive testing), angi oplasty, stenting, and 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806]).  
In the overall analysis (Yokoyama 2007), dur ing the 4.6-year follow-up, ethyl-EPA reduced 
major adverse coronary events by 19% (p =0.011). EPA treatment was also associated with a 
significant 24% reduction in the in cidence of unstable angina and a 19% decrease in nonfatal 
coronary events. This treatme nt also produced nonsignifican t reductions of 21%, 25%, and 
14% in fatal MI, nonfatal MI, and revascularizations, respectively. 
In a subgroup analysis of primary prevention cases, compared to patients with normal serum 
TG and HDL-C levels, those with abnormal levels (TG ≥150 mg/dL; HDL-C <40 mg/dL) 
had a significantly higher major adverse corona ry event (MACE) rate by 71% (p=0.014). In 
this higher risk group, ethyl-EPA treatment suppressed the MACE risk by 53% (p=0.043) 
(Saito 2008).

Amendment #[ADDRESS_1130847] str oke between ethyl-EPA 
and control groups, the inciden ce of stroke recurrence was si gnificantly lower in the EPA 
group at 6.8% versus the control group at 10.5%, a reduction of 20% (p<0.05; Tanaka 2008). 
Further, while there was no difference in the incidence of recurrent hemorrhagic cerebral 
events between the two groups, ethyl-EPA was effective in reducing the recurrence of 
ischemic cerebral vascular events such as cerebral infarc tion (Harris 2009).  
O3FA supplementation lowered CV risk in bo th the GISSI-Prevenzione study and JELIS, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_816581] (e.g., statins, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], β-blockers 
and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors).  Additionally, the JELIS trial established the 
safety and efficacy of combination therapy with  ethyl-EPA and a statin vs statin therapy 
alone for improving CV prognosis. The JELIS trial was conducted with Epadel that contains 
the same active ingredient, ethyl-EPA, as AMR101. Ethyl-EPA was shown in the JELIS study to reduce CAD events even in a Japanese population with very high intakes of O3FAs 
due to the high fish consumption. The eviden ce supporting a benefit in primary prevention 
comes from an observed 18% decrease in CV even ts in the 80% of patients in the JELIS trial 
without documented CAD (p =0.13); this effect size was essentially the same as that observed in the secondary preventi on cohort (19%, p <0.05) (Lee 2008). 
Medical Need 
CVD resulting from progressive atheroscle rosis remains the most common cause of 
morbidity and mortality all over the world. Based on 2006 US statistics (American Heart 
Association 2010), an estimated 81 million American adults (more than one in three) have one or more types of CVD. Of these, 38 milli on are estimated to be age 60 or older. Total 
CVD includes coronary heart disease (CHD): 17.6 million, heart failure (HF): 5.8 million and 
stroke: 6.4 million. CHD further divided includ es myocardial infarction (MI): 8.5 million, 
and angina pectoris (AP): 10.2 million. Final mort ality data show that CVD as the underlying 
cause of death accounted for 34.4% of all deat hs (about 830,000 of all 2.4 million deaths in 
2006). CHD is the leading cause of death in all Western indu strialized countries, despi[INVESTIGATOR_816582]-1960s. In developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], the incidence of 
CVD is increasing alarmingly. In addition to death, CVD also causes many serious non-fatal 
events and is the major cause of disability. Th erefore, additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816620] a considerab le public health benefit. 
A large number of studies have demonstrated the TG-lowering effect s of O3FAs (Ginsberg 
2001; Harris 1997). Hypertriglyceridemia is a co mmon lipid abnormality and often occurs in 
persons who are obese and have insulin resistance , Type 2 diabetes mellitus, or the metabolic 
syndrome (Jacobson 2007; Bays 2008). Elevation in TG is positively associated with accelerated atherosclerosis leadi ng to CV events, the latter ev en after correction for other 
lipid and non-lipid risk factors (Jacobson 2007). In the US (American Heart Association 
2010), the mean TG level for American a dults age 18 and older is 144.2 mg/dL (men, 
156.5 mg/dL; women, 132.1 mg/dL).  
Lifestyle modification is important fo r the management of patients with 
hypertriglyceridemia; however, for patients w ho do not adequately re spond to dietary and 
lifestyle restrictions, relatively few classes of drugs are available to treat 
hypertriglyceridemia, and each is associated with  risks that may limit their use alone or in 
combination. Currently available pharmacological treatments for hypertriglyceridemia 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 30 of 110 include fibric acid derivatives (such as gemfibrozil and fenofibrate), niacin in various 
formulations, prescription omega-3-acid et hyl esters (Lovaza/Omaco r) and statins (3 hydroxy 
3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors).  
Although the above agents have robust TG-lowering effects in patients with 
hypertriglyceridemia, the degree of TG-lowering is highly vari able; generally greater TG-
lowering effects are observed for fibrates and niacin compared with statins. Many patients 
will be satisfactorily tr eated with one or more of the above range of drugs (combined with 
appropriate diet and atte ntion to other CV risk factors and lifestyle). 
Lovaza, comprised predominantly of ethyl-EPA and the ethyl ester of docosahexaenoic acid 
(ethyl-DHA), is indicated only in patients wi th very high TG levels (>500 mg/dL), raises 
LDL-C even when combined with statins in pa tients with high TGs (200-499 mg/dL), and is 
approved at 4 g/day (equivalent to 4 capsules/day) resulting in poor patient compliance. A 
non-compliance rate of 35% was reported  in one clinical trial (Leaf 2005). 
Fibrates are clearly effective at raising HDL-C and lowering TG concentrations. However, 
their effects on vascular events remain uncertai n. Several large-scale tria ls of fibrate therapy 
have been completed in the past few years. Although some of these trials have suggested 
benefit, others have shown no effect, lead ing to uncertainty about the presence and 
magnitude of any cardiovascular protective e ffects and difficulties for clinicians in 
interpretation of the resu lts (Jun 2010). The ACCORD st udy (Ginsberg 2010) reported no 
overall benefit for fenofibrate, raising further questions about the usefulness of these agents. 
There are also safety issues w ith the above agents that limit their clinical use. Statins, 
particularly at high doses, may cause increases in hepatic transaminase s and are also known 
to cause myopathy and occasionally rhabdomyolys is, which may lead to death from acute 
renal failure. This risk may be increased when  fibrates and statins are co-administered and 
many clinicians will avoid co-prescribing these 2 medications. Fibrates are also associated 
with interactions with warfarin and hepatic tran saminase elevations. The utility of niacin is 
limited by [CONTACT_816792] a nd associated symptoms which can be difficult 
to manage even with careful dose titration a nd pre administration of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_170801]-

Patients with dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], particularly thos e with established C VD or diabetes, have 
therapeutic needs that cannot be met by [CONTACT_816793]. It is hypothes ized that achieving 
target values for LDL-C/non-HDL-C in these pa tients using a therapeutic approach of the 
combination of AMR101 and a statin will benefi t these patients. Such a combination therapy 
might increase the like lihood of therapeutic success in these patients with regards to future 
risk of CVD, based on meeting of both LDL- C/non-HDL-C goals and TG goals according to 
the ACC/AHA guidelines (Anderson 2007). Appr oximately [ADDRESS_1130849] high

prescription medication (Ford 2009). Patients with elevated TGs are currently under-served 
and would benefit from a new, safe and e ffective product that can  provide the following 
attributes: 
 Robust efficacy to lower TGs 
 Safe to use with other lipid-lo wering agents, including statins 
 Does not increase LDL-C when used in patients on statin therapy (TG = 200-499 
mg/dL) 
 Has convenient dosing regimen 
 Has class-specific positive outcomes data 
 
Pleiotropic Effects 
There is ample evidence that O3FAs decrease TGs in patients with hypertriglyceridemia 
which is a beneficial effect related to the fact that elevated TGs have been identified as an 
independent risk factor for C VD. Lowering TGs in patients with hypertriglyceridemia would 
lead to a slowing of the development of at herosclerosis. However O3FAs including EPA 
have a wide range of additional pharmacological  effects that most likely contribute to a 
beneficial effect in patients with CVD. 
Beneficial effects in clinical trials have been  attributed in part to  reducing arrhythmias (Lee 
2003; Goel 2002; Calo 2005). The case for an antiarrhythmic effect of O3FAs comes from 
clinical trials and from animal studies. Clinical trials have shown that the risk of sudden 
death in patients who have survived myocardial  infarction is greatly reduced by [CONTACT_621394] 
O3FAs in the diet (Siscovick 2000). Thus it seems that fatal ve ntricular fibrillation is less 
likely to occur during sufficient intake of O3 FAs. Animal studies support this. Coronary 
ligation studies in a variety of species (rats, dogs and marmosets) have shown that the 
incidence of ventricular fibril lation is lower in animals fed a diet rich in O3FAs before 
ligation (McLennan 1992; Leaf 1996). In isolated  cells, the story is similar (Li 1997, Engler 
2000; Omura 2001). In neonatal rat cardiac m yocytes, EPA prevents the arrhythmogenic 
action of many interventions, including high external Ca2+ and ouabain (Kang 1994). The 
antiarrhythmic effect is caused by a reduction in  electrical excitability caused by [CONTACT_816726] 
O3FAs into the phospholipid cell membranes of the cardiac myocytes, which modulates membrane ion channels. This is the postulated direct mechanism that refers to the antiarrhythmic effect of O3FAs which inhibits the fast, voltage-dependent sodium current along with the L-type calcium currents. Th is reduces the action potential of cardiac 
myocytes, reducing the susceptibil ity to arrhythmia. These cellul ar alterations are likely to 
reduce the severity of ventri cular arrhythmias by [CONTACT_816727]
2+ following ischemia. It was also shown in patients with coronary artery 
disease that long-term treatment with EPA augments both NO-mediated and non-NO-
mediated endothelium-dependent forearm vasodilatation (Tagawa 1999). 
Another, indirect mechanism refers to th e effect of O3FAs on cardiac arrhythmias by 
[CONTACT_816728]-products from 
chain elongation of their parent polyunsaturated fatty acids (Nair 1997). Most investigations 
of the link between O3FAs and heart disease ha ve demonstrated the competition between AA 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 32 of 110 and O3FAs to become substrates in the produc tion of eicosanoids. O3FAs compete with AA 
in several ways, but EPA in particular competes with AA as the substrate for the 
cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibiting th e production of thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) and in 
endothelial cells, prostaglandin I 3 (PGI 3) is synthesized from EPA (Nair 1997). The net result 
of these actions is vasodilatation. A reduced  ratio of AA/EPA shifts the spectrum of 
eicosanoid production toward an  increase in thromboxane A 3 (TXA 3) and PGI 3 at the 
expense of TXA 2 and PGI 2, respectively. This shift was found to reduce the risk of 
ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) (Coker 1982). Excessive 
production of eicosanoids derived from omega-[ADDRESS_1130850] important pharmacologi c properties of EPA is its anti-inflammatory 
and immune-modulating activity (Calder 2006; Ca lder 2010). Because of the inflammatory 
events underlying plaque rupture,  the variety of anti-inflammato ry effects of O3FAs may be 
of relevance to atherosclerosi s and its clinical manifestati ons of myocardial infarction, 
sudden death, and stroke (Mori 2004; Thie s 2003). A randomized controlled study, in 
patients awaiting surgery to remove atherosclerotic plaques in the caro tid artery, has shown 
that an anti-inflammatory response might be  involved, by [CONTACT_816729] O3FAs as a supplement ( 1.4 g/day) and the stabili ty of atherosclerotic 
plaques (Thies 2003). This improved stability was achieved by [CONTACT_816730] O3FAs 
into the plaque. 
The omega-[ADDRESS_1130851] established roles in 
inflammation and AA metabolism is a long reco gnized target for commonly used anti-
inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. O3FAs are incorporat ed into inflammatory cell phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_144045] a 
time- and dose-dependent manner. They are inco rporated partly at the expense of AA, but 
also other omega-6 fatty acids. EPA and DHA inhibit AA metabolism. Thus production of 
AA-derived eicosanoids is decreased by [CONTACT_75327] O3FA s. EPA gives rise to an alternative family 
of eicosanoids (e.g. PGE 3), which frequently have lower anti-inflammatory potency than 
those produced from AA, and to resolvins (E- and D-series) which have potent anti-
inflammatory and inflammation resolving pr operties (Serhan 2006; Dona 2008). The plasma 
AA/EPA ratio has been used as a marker of th e inflammatory status in patients with CVD 
(Rupp 2004; Holub 2009). In favor of the concept that less pro-inflamma tory processes can 
be observed already at lower AA/EPA ratios is the finding that 1.4 g/day ethyl-EPA reduced 
the incidence of plaque rupture (Thies 2003) . The AA/EPA ratio had a strong relationship 
with the incidence of CV events such as MA CE in patients undergoing elective PCI (Domei 
2009). In addition to modifying the profile of lipid-derived mediator s, O3FAs can also influence 
peptide mediator (i.e. cytokine) production. Pro-inflammatory cyt okines, or cytokines 
reflecting inflammatory processes, e.g. IL-1be ta, IL-2, IL-6, TNFal pha, platelet-derived 
growth factor (PDGF)-A and -B and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), are 
reduced by [CONTACT_816731]  (von Schacky 2007), and soluble cytokines 
reflecting interactions between blood cells and the vessel wall, such as intercellular adhesion 
molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (Yamada 2008). 
EPA and DHA intake also resulted in a d ecreased expression of genes involved in 
inflammatory- and atherogenic-related pathwa ys, such as nuclear transcription factor B

signaling (Bouwens 2009). 
In conclusion, the pleiotropic e ffects of EPA may contribute to the overall beneficial effects 
on the risk of CVD, in addition to the TG-lower ing effect. Therefore, it is possible that the 
efficacious dose of EPA that decr eases the CV event rate is lower than the dose needed to 
exert the maximum TG-lowering effect, and/or that a modest decrease of TGs after EPA 
treatment could still lead to a signif icant decrease in the risk for CVD. 
Dose Selection 
This trial will be conducted with a dose  of AMR101 of 4 g/day (4 capsules/day). 
To date, only one study was published investigat ing the effects of combination treatment 
with an O3FA plus statins on clinical cardiovascular events. This is the Japan EPA Lipid 
Intervention Study (JELIS) (Yokoyama 2007), as previously discussed, wherein ethyl-EPA 
combined with low-dose pravastatin or simvastatin compared with statin therapy alone reduced major coronary events without alteri ng rates of sudden cardiac death. These effects 
were achieved without any signifi cant changes in total, LDL- or HDL-C and a statistically 
significant (p <0.0001) decrease in triglycerides, suggesting th at EPA can lower CVD risk by 
[CONTACT_816732]-C lowering (Yoko yama 2007). In a subanalysis of this study, 
the addition of ethyl-EPA to pravastatin or simvastatin reduced also the incidence of 
coronary heart disease events in high-risk pati ents with metabolic syndrome and atherogenic 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816588]-C (Saito 2008). The JELIS 
study was performed in a large patient popula tion wherein an ethyl-EPA dose of 1.8 g/day 
translated to significant benefits on CV events. 
In the ANCHOR study (Amarin-sponsored), both  the 2 and 4 g/day dosing regimens of 
AMR101 resulted in statistically  significant reductions of TG s (see Section 1.3). However, 
since the 4 g/day dose caused a larger reducti on in TG and other lipid, lipoprotein and 
inflammatory markers, the AMR101 4 g/day dose was selected for the present study. 
1.6. Risk/Benefit 
Across all completed Amarin-sponsored studie s, the proportion of patients (based on the 
safety population from the randomized, double-blind periods of the studies) experiencing any adverse events was similar for patients on pl acebo (light paraffin oil) and patients on 
AMR101 (57.1% and 57.4% for placebo and AMR101, respectively). The proportion of 
patients experiencing a serious adverse event (SAE) was also similar for both treatment 
groups (5.2% and 6.0% for placebo and AMR101, re spectively). The safe ty profile in the 
open-label extensions was similar to that obs erved in the double-blind treatment periods. 
There were no SAEs attributed to AMR101 dur ing the open-label exte nsion periods of the 
studies. 
In summary, AMR101 is very well tolerated at daily doses up to [ADDRESS_1130852] 
demonstrated that it is safe. See the Inve stigator’s Brochure for more information.

3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. Type of Study 
Phase 3b, multi-Center, multin ational, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study 
3.2. Study Population 
The population for this study is men and women ≥45 years of age with established CVD, or 
men and women ≥[ADDRESS_1130853] atherogenic dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816589] (but at tr eatment goal for LDL-C, by [CONTACT_27180] a 
statin) and hypertriglyceridemia. More details are listed in the inclusion criteria. 
The patients will need to provide consent to pa rticipate in the study and be willing and able 
to comply with the protocol and the study procedures. 
3.3. Study Periods 
This study consists of th e following study periods: 
 Screening Period : During the screening period, pa tients will be evaluated for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
At the first visit to the Research Unit (Vis it 1), study procedures will be performed for 
evaluation of patient’s eligibility in the study. At this screening visit, patients will sign an

Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 36 of 110 informed consent form before any study pro cedure is performed; the informed consent 
form will cover the treatment/follow-up peri od. Based on the evaluation from Visit 1, the 
following situations may occur: 
o Patients who are eligible for participati on based on the study procedures on Visit 1 
will return to the Research Unit for Vis it 2 (randomization visit) to start the 
treatment/follow-up period. This case includ es, for example, patients at Visit 1who 
are on a stable dose of a stat in, are planning to stay on the same statin and the same 
dose of the statin, and who not need to  wash out any non-statin lipid-altering 
medications. 
o Patients who are not eligible for partic ipation based on the study procedures on 
Visit 1 and are unlikely to become eligib le in the next 28 days (for example: 
unlikely to stabilize statin dose, unabl e to wash out non-st atin lipid-altering 
medications, etc.): these patients wi ll be screen failed after Visit 1. 
o Patients not eligible for participation in  the study based on the study procedures on 
Visit 1 may possibly become eligible in th e next 28 days: these patients may return 
at the discretion of the inve stigator for a second optiona l screening visit (Visit 1.1) 
at which time the procedures needed for re-evaluation of th e previously failed 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  will be repeated. This ca se includes, for example, 
patients who are started on a statin at Visit 1, whose statin dose is changed at Visit 1, 
and/or needed to wash out non-statin lipid-altering medica tions. The following 
applies for these patients: 
 Patients with a change in the statin or statin dose on Visit [ADDRESS_1130854] 28 days before the lipid qualifying measurements 
at Visit 1.1. Other concomitant medications  (antidiabetic therapy, for example) 
can be optimized or stabilized during this period. 
 Patients starting a washout at Visit [ADDRESS_1130855] 
28 days (only 7 days for bile acid sequestrants) before the lipid qualifying 
measurements at Visit 1.1. 
 Patients at Visit 1 who are on a stable dos e of a statin, are planning to stay on 
the same statin at the same dose, and who do not need any medication washout, but were asked to return for Visit 1.1 to  repeat one or more of the other study 
procedures not related to concomitant medications  
o Patients who become eligible for participation based on the additional study procedures at Visit 1.1 will return to the Research Unit for Visit 2 (randomization 
visit) to start the treatment/follow-up period. 
At the end of the screening period, patients will need to meet all inclus ion/exclusion criteria 
before they can be randomized. Patients who ar e not eligible for pa rticipation after the 
screening period (based on study pr ocedures at Visit 1 and/or Vi sit 1.1) may return at a later 
date for rescreening. These patien ts will need to re-start with  all procedures starting with 
Visit 1. This includes patients who need more time to stabilize one or more conditions or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (for example: statin, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, thyroi d hormone, HIV-protease 
inhibitor therapy). 
 Treatment/Follow-Up Period : Within [ADDRESS_1130856] screening visit (Visit 1) or 
within [ADDRESS_1130857] screening visit (V isit 1) for those patient s that have a second

Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 37 of 110 screening visit (Visit 1.1), eligible patients will enter the treatment/follow-up period. 
During this period, the patients will receive study drug during the planned visits at the 
Research Site and take the study drug while away from the Research Site. 
During the visits, study procedures will be perfor med for evaluation of efficacy and safety. A 
detailed schedule of procedures  is provided in Appendix A. 
3.4. Study Duration 
The estimated study duration includes a plan ned 18-month enrollment period followed by a 
follow-up period of approximately 3.5 years in expected duration (approximately 5 years in 
total). Patients will be randomized at different  times during the enrollment period but will all 
end the study at the same date (study end date).  It is planned that all randomized patients will 
receive study medication and be followed-up until the study end date . This is an event-driven 
trial and patients will continue in the trial if  the trial runs longer than expected, or will 
terminate earlier if the trial runs shorter than expected. 
The total duration of the trial is based on a median 4-year follow-up period across patients. 
The first patient randomized would be followe d for 4.75 years (the l ongest individual follow-
up duration), and the last patient randomized would be followed for 3.25 year (the shortest 
individual follow-up duration). 
3.5. Study Groups 
At Visit 2 (Day 0), eligible study patients  will be randomly assigned to the following 
treatment groups: 
 Group 1 : AMR101 4 g daily (four 1000 mg capsules daily) 
 Group 2 : placebo (four capsules daily) 
The four AMR101 or placebo capsules daily wi ll be taken as two capsules in the morning 
and two capsules in the evening (twice-per-day dosing regimen). 
3.6. Number of Patients 
This is an event-driven trial:  It is expected that a minimu m of 1612 primary efficacy endpoint 
events will be required during the study. A to tal of approximately 7990 patients will be 
entered into the study to either receive AM R101 or placebo (approximately 3995 patients per 
treatment group) in order to observe an estimated 1612 events that make up the primary 
composite endpoint for efficacy. 
3.7. Number of Study Sites 
Participants will be enrolled at multiple Research Sites in multiple countries. 
3.8. Randomization 
On Day 0, eligible patients will be randomized to one of 2 study groups using a computer-
generated randomization schema. Randomized tr eatment assignment to either AMR101 or 
placebo in a 1:1 ratio will be prov ided using the internet (IWR). 
3.9. Blinding 
This is a double-blind study. Patients, investig ators, pharmacists and ot her supporting staff at 
the Research Sites, personnel and designees of the Sponsor, study administrators and 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 38 of 110 personnel at the organization(s) and vendors supporting the study will be unaware of the 
randomization code (i.e., they will not know  which study participan ts are receiving the 
experimental drug and which are receivi ng the placebo drug). The study medication 
AMR101 and placebo capsules will be similar in size and appearance to maintain blinding. 
During the double-blind treatm ent/follow-up period, everyone (p atients, investigators, 
pharmacists and other supporting staff at the Rese arch Sites, personnel and designees of the 
Sponsor, study administrators and personnel at the organization(s) and vendors 
managing/supporting the study), with the exceptio n of the laboratory personnel performing 
the analysis, will be blinded to individual re sults of the efficacy la boratory measurements 
(including lipid values). Indivi dual results from the lipid pr ofile may be unblinded in the 
event of an emergency for a patient. 
3.10. Stratification 
Participants will be assigned to treatment groups stratified by [CONTACT_816718], use of 
ezetimibe and by [CONTACT_101820] (Western ized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific 
countries). There are two CV risk categories: 
 CV Risk Category 1: patients with establis hed CVD defined in the inclusion criteria. 
Patients with diabetes and establishe d CVD are included in this category. 
 CV Risk Category 2: patients with diabetes and at least one additional risk factor for 
CVD, but no established CVD. 
Stratification will be recorded in the IWR at the time of enrollment. Approximately 70% of 
randomized patients will be in the CV Risk Category 1 and approximately 30% of 
randomized patients will be in the CV Risk Category 2. Enrollment with patients of a CV risk category will be stopped when the planned number of patients in that risk category is reached. 
4. STUDY POPULATION 
4.1. Inclusion Criteria 
Patients meeting the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the study: 
1. Fasting TG levels of ≥200 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L) and <500 mg/dL (5.64 mmol/L). 
2. LDL-C >40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L) and ≤100 mg/dL (2.60 mmol/L) and on stable therapy 
with a statin (with or wit hout ezetimibe) for at least 4 weeks prior to the LDL-C/TG 
baseline qualifying measurements for randomization  
 Stable therapy is defined as the same daily  dose of the same statin for at least 28 
days before the lipid qualification measurem ents (TG and LDL-C) and, if applicable, 
the same daily dose of ezetimibe for at le ast 28 days before the lipid qualification 
measurements (TG and LDL-C). Patients who have their statin therapy or use of 
ezetimibe initiated at Visit 1, or have thei r statin, statin dose and/or ezetimibe dose 
changed at Visit 1, will need to go through a stabilization period of at least 28 days 
since initiation/change and have their qua lifying lipid measurements measured (TG 
and LDL-C) after the washout  period (at Visit 1.1).  
 Statins may be administered with or without ezetimibe.

6. STUDY PROCEDURES 
6.1. Assessment Schedule  
A detailed schedule of procedur es is provided in Appendix A. 
6.1.1. Screening Period 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening Visit (Visit 1) 
Patients will come to the Research Site for Visit 1. They will be instructed  to fast for at least 
10 hours before their visit. 
If patients qualify for randomization based on th e procedures at Visit 1, they need to be 
randomized within 42 days after Visit 1. The foll owing procedures will be performed at the 
screening visit: 
 Obtain signed informed consent 
 Assign the patient a patient number 
 Obtain medical, surgical and family history 
 Record demographics 
 Obtain height, weight, and body mass index 
 Obtain vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart ra te, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and body temperature) 
 Obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram 
 Evaluate inclusion/exclusion criteria 
 This includes procedures and (fasting)  blood samples (for example, hs-CRP, 
calculated creatinine clearance) as needed  to determine the CV risk category (see 
inclusion criteria) 
 Obtain fasting blood samples for chemistry and hematology testing 
 Obtain a fasting blood sample for the lipid profile (TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, non-

[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening Visit (Visit 1.1) 
Some patients will skip Visit 1.1: Patients w ho qualify for study participation after Visit 1 
because they meet all inclusion criterion and non e of the exclusion criteria, may return to the 
Research Site for Visit 2 to be randomized and to start the treatment/f ollow-up period of the 
study. For these patients, Visit 2 will occur soon after Visit 1. 
Patients, who do not qualify at Visit 1, may re turn to the Research Site for a second 
qualifying visit (Visit 1.1) at th e discretion of the investigator. At Visit 1.1, procedures that 
caused failure of eligibility at Visit [ADDRESS_1130868] arted treatment with a statin, changed their 
statin, changed the daily dose of their statin, started to washout prohi bited medications or 
started a stabilization period with certain medi cations (see inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
details). Any of these changes at Visit [ADDRESS_1130869] Visit 1.1 to determ ine whether they qualif y based on lipid level 
requirements (TG and LDL-C) determined at Vis it 1. Other procedures that caused failure of 
eligibility at Visit 1 will al so be repeated at Visit 1.1. 
The following procedures will be performed at the screening visit: 
 Obtain vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart ra te, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and body temperature) 
 Evaluate inclusion/exclusion criteria; only those evaluations will be repeated that 
deemed the patient not eligible on Visit 1. 
 Obtain fasting blood samples for chemistry and hematology testing. Only those 
samples will be obtained that deemed the patient not eligible on Visit 1. 
 Obtain a fasting blood sample for the lipid profile (TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, non-
HDL-C, VLDL-C) if the patient was deemed  not eligible on Visit 1. This includes 
patients who at Visit 1 started treatment w ith a statin, changed their statin, changed 
the daily dose of their statin, started to washout prohibited medications or started a 
stabilization period with certain medications  (see inclusion/excl usion criteria for 
details). These patients will have a fasting blood sample collected at Visit 1.1 for the 
qualifying lipid values (TG and LDL-C), a nd the TG and LDL-C inclusion criteria 
will be evaluated.

treatment/follow period of the study is shorter than the expe cted end date, less follow-up 
phone calls will be needed. 
Every attempt will be made to talk to  each patient within this time frame. 
The following information will be collected from the patient: 
 Possible efficacy endpoints related to CV even ts. Patients will be asked to return to 
the Research Site to assess for any endpoints or events identified. 
 Adverse events 
 Concomitant medications 
 Current address and contact [CONTACT_3031] (update if changed or will be changing) 
Patients will be reminded about the following items: 
 To take the study medication according to  the dosing schedule  assigned, with food 
 When to return to the Research Center for the next visit 
 To bring the unused study me dication to the next visit 
 To not take study drug on the morning of their next visit 
 To fast for at least [ADDRESS_1130874] 10 hours. For the purposes of this study, fasting is defined as nothing by [CONTACT_24340] (and any essentia l medications). 
The investigator must review a nd sign all laboratory test report s. At screening, patients who 
have laboratory values that are outside the exclusionary limits specified in the exclusion 
criteria may not be enrolled in  the study (patients can be cons idered for the study if values 
are classified as not clinical ly significant by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator). Af ter randomization, the 
investigator will be notified if laboratory valu es are outside of their normal range. In this 
case, the investigator will be required to conduct c linically appropriate follow-up procedures.

nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, uric acid, creatine kinase, and HbA 1c. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Fasting Lipid Profile 
The fasting lipid panel includes: TG, TC , LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, and VLDL-C.  
At all visits, LDL-C will be calculated using the Friedewald equation. At Visit [ADDRESS_1130875] LDL-C will be used if at the sa me visit TG >400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L). These 
LDL-C values will be used for the evaluation of the LDL-C inclusion criterion (LDL-C 
qualifying measurements for randomization) and for the assessment of changes in the statin therapy when LDL-C is not at goa l. At all remaining visits (e xcept Visit 2 and Visit 4) LDL-
C will be measured by [CONTACT_816795] L Cholesterol or by [CONTACT_816796] >400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L). In addition, irrespective of the TG levels, at Visit 
2 (0 Months of Follow-up, baseline) and at Vi sit 4 (12 Months of Follow-up), LDL-C will be 
measured by [CONTACT_816797]. These Prepara tive Ultracentrifugation LDL-C 
measurements will be used in th e statistical analysis including the calculation of the percent 
change from baseline (1 year versus baseline). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Genetic testing 
A fasting blood sample will be stored for future genetic testing at the discretion of the sponsor. The specifics of this test will be determ ined at a later date. Th is sample is optional 
as local regulations may prohibit genetic samp les to be collected or shipped outside the 
country, or patients may not consent. 
Research on genetic testing will look for links  between genes and certain diseases, including 
their treatment(s) such as medicines and medical  care.  The blood samples will be collected 
in the study center with the regular  protocol-required labs. Each patient tube with sample for 
genetic testing will be labeled with patient number only.  The site will maintain a Subject 
Code Identification List for cross-referen ce.  The patient number does not contain any 
identifiable information (i.e. Patient initials, date of birth, etc). Un-analyzed samples will be 
stored frozen by [CONTACT_127026] a period of up to 2 years following th e end of the study, at 
which time they will be destroyed. If samples are tested, results will not be reported to the 
patient, parents, relatives, or attending physic ian and will not be reco rded in the patient’s 
medical records. There will be no follow-up contact [CONTACT_816798]. The subject can withdraw their consent for genetic testing at any time up to analysis, 
even after the sample has been obtained.  The s ubject can notify the site in writing that they 
withdraw their consent for the genetic testi ng portion of the study, and it will be documented 
by [CONTACT_816799],  as well as captured in the CRF .  The lab will be notified to 
pull the sample and destroy it.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biomarkers Assays 
The biomarker assays include: hs-CRP, Apo B and hsTnT. [IP_ADDRESS]. Additional laboratory tests 
Additional laboratory tests include: 
 A urine pregnancy test will be administered to women of childbearing potential at 
certain visits as listed in schedule of procedures (Appe ndix A). The urine pregnancy

Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #[ADDRESS_1130876] kits, or at a 
certified clinical laboratory. 
 A fasting blood sample (12 mL) for archiving. This sample will be collected only at 
sites in countries where allowed by [CONTACT_816738]. The plasma from the archiving sample will be stored frozen in 2 separate equal aliquots, a nd will be used at the Sponsor’s discretion to perform 
repeat analyses described in the protocol or to perform other tests related to cardiovascular health. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blinding of Laboratory Results 
All efficacy laboratory results during the double-blind period of the trial will be blinded (values not provided) to patient s, investigators, pharmacists a nd other supporting staff at the 
Research Sites, personnel and designees of th e Sponsor, study administrators and personnel 
at the organization(s) and ve ndors managing and/or supporting the study, with the exception 
of the laboratory personnel conducting the assays . To ensure patient safety, hsTnT values 
will be reported to the site. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Flagging of Critical Lab Values 
Critical lab values are values that may warrant medical intervention to avoid possible harm to 
a patient. Critical lab values will be defined in the Laboratory Manual for the study, and the 
Research Site will be notified of the occurrence of  a critical lab value (critical high or critical 
low) by a special annotation (flag) in the laboratory reports prov ided to the Research Sites. 
Although laboratory values that are part of  the efficacy endpoints during the double-blind 
period of the study will not be provided to the Research Site (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the sites 
will be notified when the TG value of a patient sample is >1000 mg/dL (11.29 mmol/L) 
(critical high TG value) or if the LDL-C va lues of a patient sample is >130 mg/dL (3.37 
mmol/L) (critical high LDL-C value). These critical high values will need to be confirmed by a repeat measurement (new fasting blood sample) within 7 days. TG value of >2000 mg/dL (22.58 mmol/L) will also be flagge d, so that appropriate medi cal action can be taken by [CONTACT_23995]. 
If TG values are confirmed critically high, patients may be discontinued from study drug 
with the option to remain on study (see Section 11.1 ODIS). The investigator should use the 
best clinical judgment for each patient which could include the use of approved TG-lowering 
medications after patients have been discontinued from study drug. 
If LDL-C values are confirmed critically high, the investigator may need to take appropriate 
medical action which could include: reinforc e/intensify therapeutic lifestyle changes 
(including diet and physical activ ity), increase the dose of the present statin therapy, add 
ezetimibe, or prescribe a more potent statin to lower LDL-C. The investigator should use the 
best clinical judgment for each patient. 
6.3.2. Medical Procedures 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medical, Surgical and Family History 
Medical history, including family history and details regarding all illnesses and allergies, 
date(s) of onset, status of current condition, and smoking and alcohol use will be collected on 
all patients.

collected for all patients. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs 
Vital signs include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body 
temperature. Blood pressure will be measured using a standardized process: 
 Patient should sit for 5 minutes with feet flat on the floor and measurement arm 
supported so that the midpoint of the manometer cuff is at heart level. 
 Use a mercury sphygmomanometer or automatic blood pressure device with an 
appropriately sized cuff with the bladder centered over the brachial artery. 
Blood pressure should be recorded to the near est [ADDRESS_1130877] 2 mmHg 
mark. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physical Examination 
A physical examination must include source docu mentation of general appearance, skin, and 
specific head and neck, heart, lung, abdomen, ex tremities, and neuromuscular assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Height, Weight and Body Mass Index 
Height and weight will  be measured. Measurement of wei ght should be performed with the 
patient dressed in indoor clothing, with shoes removed, and bladder empty.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Waist Circumference 
Waist circumference will be measured with a tape  measure, as follows: Start at the top of the 
hip bone then bring the tape measure all the wa y around – level with the navel. Make sure the 
tape measure is snug, but without compressing the skin, and that it is pa rallel with the floor.  
Patients should not hold their breath while measuring waist circumference. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
ECGs (standard 12-lead) will be obtained annually. Site personnel should make every 
attempt to perform a patient’s ECG using the sa me equipment at each visit. ECGs will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_816800]. Silent MIs will be sent for event 
adjudication.

Only qualified patients who m eet all of the inclusion crite ria and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be randomized and will receive study medication starting at Visit 2 (Day 0). 
Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to  one of the 2 treatment groups. Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_816718], use of ezetimibe and by [CONTACT_101820] 
(Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific countries) (See Section 3.10). Approximately 70% of randomized patients will be in the CV Risk Category 1, including 
patients with established CVD, and approximately  30% of randomized patients will be in the 
CV Risk Category 2, including patients with diab etes and at least one additional risk factor 
but no established CVD. Enrollment with patien ts of a CV risk category will be stopped 
when the planned number of patients in  that risk category is reached. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Emergency Unblinding 
In an emergency, when knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the patien t, the investigator may request the patient’s 
treatment assignment for unblinding. Prior to unblinding the patient’s individual treatment 
assignment, the investigator should assess th e relationship of an adverse event to the 
administration of the study drug (Yes or No).  If the blind is broken for any reason, the 
investigator must record the date and reason for breaking the blind on the appropriate Case 
Report Form (CRF) and source documents. Treatment

Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 55 of 110 7.1.3. Compliance Control 
It is recommended that, unless cl ear contraindications arise, pa tients be strongly encouraged 
to adhere to their treatment regimen with th e study drug for the durat ion of the trial. Any 
interruptions of therapy should, if possible, be brief (e.g., <4 weeks) and only for clinically 
indicated reasons, such as adverse events. Discontinuations will be discouraged as much as 
possible. Any discontinuations should be  based on compelling clinical reasons. 
For every patient, an assessment of compliance to the study drug treatment regimen must be obtained at each scheduled visit. Study medication will be dispensed in amounts exceeding the amount required for the study. Patients will be instructed to re turn all unused study 
medication at the next visit. Compliance to th e study drug regimen will be evaluated at each 
visit by [CONTACT_618637]. Discrepancies will be evaluated and discussed with each 
patient to assess compliance. If compliance is unsatisfactory, the patient will be counseled about the importance of complia nce to the dosing regimen. At the end of the study, the final 
study medication compliance will be determ ined by [CONTACT_816736] (see Section 
12.2.2). 
7.2. Study Restrictions 
7.2.1. Concomitant Medications during Treatment/Follow-Up Period 
Any medications administered during th e study period must be documented on the 
Concomitant Medication CRF. Patients must not ha ve taken any investigational agent within 
90 days prior to screening. Patie nts cannot participate in any ot her investigational medication 
trial while participating in this study.  
The following non-study drug related, non-statin, lip id-altering medications and supplements, 
and foods are prohibited during the study (from Visit [ADDRESS_1130878] Visit-End of 
Study), except for compelling medical reasons in  ODIS patients (see description of ODIS in 
section 11.1): 
 niacin >200 mg/day; 
 fibrates; 
 prescription omega-3 fatty acid medications; 
 dietary supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., flaxseed, fish, krill, or 
algal oils); 
 bile acid sequestrants; 
 cyclophosphamide; 
 systemic retinoids 
If any of these products would be used duri ng the treatment/follow-up period of the study, it 
should be for compelling medical reasons in ODI S patients, and it should be documented in 
the Concomitant Medication CRF. If the ODIS patie nt agrees to restart study medication, the 
use of excluded medication must be discontinued. 
Foods enriched with omega-3 fatty acids ar e strongly discouraged after Visit 1 for the 
duration of the study (does not apply to The Netherlands or Canada only. Therefore, all 
centers in The Netherlands and Cana da must ignore this request).

Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 56 of 110 The following products are allowed: statins, ezetimibe, and herbal products & dietary 
supplements not containing omega-3 fatty acids. 
Statins: 
 The same statin at the same dose should  be continued until the end of the study, 
unless deemed medically necessary to change because of an adverse event or lack of 
efficacy (LOE).  It is preferred that if LOE is the determining factor that ezetimibe 
be added to the present dose. 
 Switching between a brand name [CONTACT_816951]. 
  Statins may be administered with or without ezetimibe. 
 Based on the FDA recommendation, simvastatin  [ADDRESS_1130879] not experienced any 
muscle toxicity. (See reference:  FDA Drug Safety Communication: Ongoing safety review of high-dose Zocor (simvastatin) and increased risk of muscle injury.

 Changing of the type of statin or the statin dose during the treatment/follow-up 
period of the study should only be done for compelling medical reasons and must be 
documented in the CRF. 
LDL-C Rescue: 
 If the level of LDL-C exceeds 130 mg/d L (3.37 mmol/L) during the study (initial 
measurement and confirmed by a second dete rmination at least 1 week later), the 
investigator may either increase the dose of  the present statin therapy or may add 
ezetimibe to lower LDL-C. The investigator should use the best clinical judgment for 
each patient.

personnel will account for all used and unused  study drug. Any unused study drug will be 
destroyed. The investigator agrees not to dist ribute study drug to any patient, except those 
patients participa ting in the study. 
9. EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
9.1. Specification of Variables and Procedures 
The primary endpoint and the majority of the secondary and tertiary endpoints are based on 
clinical events related to CVD and mortality. All events occurring between randomization 
and the study end date (inclusive) must be reco rded. Only adjudicated events will be included 
in the final analyses. Further details on the asse ssment of clinical even ts and their definitions 
will be found in the CEC charter. Important definitions are listed in Appendix B of this 
protocol. 
9.2. Efficacy Endpoints 
9.2.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Time from randomization to the first occurren ce of the composite of the following clinical 
events: 
 CV death, 
 Nonfatal MI (including silent MI; ECGs will be performed annually for the detection 
of silent MIs), 
 Nonfatal stroke, 
 Coronary revascularization  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816572]/non-invasive testing. 
The first occurrence of any of these major adverse vascular events during the follow-up 
period of the study will be included in the incidence. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 59 of 110 9.2.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is: 
 The composite of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization, 
unstable angina determined to be caused by [CONTACT_816724]/non-
invasive testing and requiri ng emergent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nonf atal stroke, or peripheral 
CVD requiring intervention, angioplasty, by[CONTACT_4897], or aneurysm repair. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints are as fo llows (to be tested in said order): 
 The composite of total mortality, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke; 
 The composite of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization, 
unstable angina determined to be caused by [CONTACT_816724]/non-

 Total mortality; 
 Fatal and nonfatal MI (including silent MI); 
 Coronary Revascularization;  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816573]/non-invasive testing ; 
 Fatal and nonfatal stroke. 
For the secondary endpoints that count a single event, the first occurrence of this type of 
event will be counted in each patient. For s econdary endpoints that are composites of two or 
more types of events, the first occurrence of any of the event t ypes included in  the composite 
will be counted in each patient. 
9.2.3. Tertiary Efficacy Endpoints: 
 The second, third, fourth, and fifth majo r CV event of the primary composite 
endpoint. The type of (nonfatal) events may occur in any order. 
 Primary endpoint in subset of patients with diabetes mellitus;

For the tertiary endpoints that count a single event, the first occu rrence of this type of event 
will be counted in each patient. For tertiary endpoints that are composites of two or more 
types of events, the first occurrence of any of the event types included in the composite will 
be counted in each patient (except when stated  otherwise, for the second, third, fourth, and 
fifth major CV event). 
10. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
10.1. Specification of Variables and Procedures 
Safety assessments will include adverse events, clinical laboratory measurements (chemistry, 
hematology), 12-lead ECGs, vital signs (systo lic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature), and physical examinations as per Study 
Procedures/Appendix A. 
A complete medical, surgical and family history will be completed at Visit 1. 
A list of the analytes to be measured for th e safety evaluation is found in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. All 
laboratory test results must be evaluated by [CONTACT_816743]. 
Any observations at physical examinations or laboratory values considered by [CONTACT_816802]. 
10.2. Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with the medicati on under investigation. An adverse event can 
therefore be any unfavorable  and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally asso ciated with the use of an investigational 
medication product, whether or not related to  the investigational medication product. All 
adverse events, including observe d or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to 
be recorded on the appropriate CRF. Each adve rse event is to be evaluated for duration, 
intensity, and causal relationship with the study medication or other factors. 
Adverse events, which include clinical laborator y test variables, will  be monitored from the 
time of informed consent until st udy participation is complete. Patients should be instructed 
to report any adverse event that they experien ce to the investigator. Beginning with Visit 2, 
investigators should assess for adverse events at each visit and record the event on the 
appropriate adverse event CRF. Wherever possible, a specific di sease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_816745]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or sy mptom is not considered a com ponent of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_093], it should be reco rded as a separate adverse event on the CRF. 
Any medical condition that is present when a pati ent is screened or present at baseline that 
does not deteriorate should not be reported as an adverse even t. However, medical conditions 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 61 of 110 or signs or symptoms present at  baseline and that change in se verity or seriousness at any 
time during the study should be repo rted as an adverse event. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen will be reported 
as adverse events or SAEs. The investigator wi ll exercise his or her medical and scientific 
judgment in deciding whether an abnormal labor atory finding or other abnormal assessment 
is clinically significant. 
The investigator will rate the se verity (intensity) of each advers e event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study 
drug using the categories of Yes or No. Severity: 
 Mild – An event that is usually transient in  nature and generally not interfering with 
normal activities. 
 Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
activities. 
 Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity or 
inability to work or pe rform normal daily activity. 
Causality Assessment: 
The relationship of an adverse event to the ad ministration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
 No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – Th e time course between the administration 
of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal 
relationship and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is 
suspected. 
 Yes – The time course between the admini stration of study drug and the occurrence 
or worsening of the adverse event is consis tent with a causal re lationship and no other 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], co mplications, etc.) can be identified. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from study medication administration 
 The event should occur after the study medicat ion is given. The length of time from 
study medication exposure to even t should be evaluated in th e clinical context of the 
event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, in tercurrent diseases 
 Each report should be evaluated in the contex t of the natural history and course of the 
disease being treated and any othe r disease the patient may have. 
 Concomitant medication 
 The other medications the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives 
should be examined to determine whether a ny of them might be recognized to cause 
the event in question. 
 Known response pattern for th is class of study medication 
 Clinical and/or preclinical da ta may indicate whether a particular response is likely to 
be a class effect. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 62 of 110  Exposure to physical an d/or mental stresses 
 The exposure to stress might induce advers e changes in the patient and provide a 
logical and better explan ation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study medication 
 The known pharmacologic properties (absor ption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion) of the study medi cation should be considered. 
Unexpected Adverse Events – An unexpected ad verse event is an adverse event either not 
previously reported or where the nature, seriousness, severity, or outcome is not consistent 
with the current Investigator’s Brochure. 
10.2.1. Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following 
criteria: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening- Note: The term “life-th reatening” in the de finition of “serious” 
refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It 
does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were 
more severe. 
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]- Note: In general, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117706] a pre-existing condition(s) that did not worsen from baseline is not considered adverse even ts and should not be reported as SAEs. 
 Results in disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 Is an important medical event- Note: Importa nt medical events that may not result in 
death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816591], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency. 
By [CONTACT_816803]. The in tention is that the endpoint events are not 
reported to IRBs as SAEs, unl ess the IRB requires that thes e are reported. Investigators 
should specifically inform their institution/IRB of this plan an d confirm whether or not they 
want the endpoint events reported. By [CONTACT_816804] t with the US FDA, these endpoints will also 
not be reported to the US FDA as SAEs; rather they will be reported as endpoint events. Following adjudication if the event is determined to not meet the criteria for an event, the event will be evaluated as an SA E beginning with that day as Day 0. 
10.3. Serious Adverse Event Reporting – Procedure for Investigators 
10.3.1. Initial Reports 
All SAEs occurring from the time of inform ed consent until [ADDRESS_1130882] be  reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 
hours  of the knowledge of the occurr ence (this refers to any adve rse event that meets any of 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 63 of 110 the aforementioned serious criteria). SAEs that  the investigator cons iders related to study 
medication occurring after the 28-day follow-up pe riod will also be reported to the Sponsor 
or designee.  
The investigator is requ ired to submit SAE reports to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) in accordance with local requirements . All 
investigators involved in studies using the same investigational medicinal product (IMP) will 
receive any Suspected Unexpected Serious A dverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) reports for onward 
submission to their local IRB as required. All re ports sent to investigators will be blinded. 
In addition, regulatory agencies will be notified of SAEs per the requirements of the specific 
regulatory jurisdiction regulations and laws. 
10.3.2. Follow-Up Reports 
The investigator must continue to follow the patient until the SAE has subsided, or until the 
condition becomes chronic in natu re, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the 
patient dies. Within [ADDRESS_1130883] 
update the SAE form electronically in th e EDC system for the study and submit any 
supporting documentation (e.g., laboratory test  reports, patient di scharge summary, or 
autopsy reports) to the Sponsor or designee via fax or email. 
10.3.3. Reporting by [CONTACT_816746]. Cases will be unblinded for reporting purposes as required. 
10.4. Exposure In Utero During Clinical Trials 
If a patient becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator should report the pregnancy 
to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_1130884] the Exposure In Utero  form to the investigator for completion. 
The patient should be followed by [CONTACT_816747]. If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason before the antici pated date, the investig ator should notify the 
Sponsor or designee. At the completion of th e pregnancy, the investig ator will document the 
outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum co mplication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the inve stigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting an SAE. 
11. TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION/PATIENT WITHDRAWAL 
Patients may withdraw from the study at  any time and for any reason. Study drug 
administration may also be discon tinued at any time, at the disc retion of the investigator. In 
any case, follow-up for efficacy and safety should be continued. 
11.1. Reasons for Early Study Drug Discontinuation 
Study drug discontinuation should be  avoided as much as possible, but may be done for any 
of the following reasons: 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 64 of 110  Patient withdraws consent or requests earl y discontinuation from the study for any 
reason. Patients should be en couraged to continue to participate in the study for the 
entire duration of the study even if they choose not to take study medication any 
longer. 
 Occurrence of a clinical or laboratory advers e event, either serious or non-serious, at 
the discretion of the investigator. The S ponsor or designee shoul d be notified if a 
patient is discontinued because of an advers e event or laboratory abnormality. It is 
recommended that, unless clear contraindi cations arise, patients be strongly 
encouraged to adhere to their treatment re gimen with the study drug for the duration 
of the trial. Any interruptions of therapy s hould, if possible, be brief (e.g., <4 weeks) 
and only for clinically indicated reasons, such as adverse events. The following 
should be considered re ason for discontinuation: 
o ALT > 3x ULN and bilirubin > 1.5x ULN 
o ALT >5x ULN 
o ALT >3x ULN and appearance or worsening of hepatitis 
o ALT > 3x ULN persisting for >4weeks 
o ALT > 3x ULN and cannot be monitored weekly for 4 weeks 
 Any medical condition or personal circ umstance that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], exposes the patient to risk  by [CONTACT_816748] e study or precludes 
adherence to the protocol. 
 Sponsor discontinues the study. 
 A TG value that is flagged as critica lly high, i.e., >1000 mg/dL (11.29 mmol/L), and 
confirmed as critically high by a repeat  measurement (new fasting blood sample) 
within 7 days. In this case, a patient may be discontinued from study drug (with the 
option to remain ODIS) and other lipid-a ltering medications may be (re)initiated. If 
the TG value is flagged as >2000 mg/dL (22.58 mmol/L) then appropriate medical 
action can be taken by [CONTACT_816805]. 
Occurrence of an outcome even t according to the judgment of the investigator is not 
considered a valid reason for study drug discontinuation. 
Patients whose treatment with study medica tion is discontinued early, and have not 
withdrawn consent, will stay in study and will be monitored until the end of the study. 
Patients that continue in the study after indefinite cessation of  therapy will be characterized 
as Off Drug In Study (ODIS). ODIS patients should be asked to return to the study site for an 
interim visit once the patient has been off study drug for >[ADDRESS_1130885] the option to 
restart study medication at any poi nt once characterized as ODIS.  
The reason for study drug discontinuation or interruption will be recorded on the CRF. 
11.2. Follow-Up after Early Study Drug Di scontinuation/Lost to Follow-Up 
 Patients who prematurely discontinue study drug are not to be replaced. 
 All randomized patients must be followed up according to the st udy flowchart until 
the study end date or death, regardless of  whether they discontinue study drug 
prematurely or not. Any event occurring after early study dr ug discontinuation will be 
recorded 
up through the study end date. 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 65 of 110  In order to follow the medi cal status of the patients, especially when they 
discontinued the study, investigators are enco uraged to obtain information from the 
patient’s primary care practitioner (physic ian or any other medical care provider). 
Investigators are also requested to try as mu ch as possible to re-contact [CONTACT_816806] r vital status as well as their status with 
respect to the primary endpoint, and thus avoid lost to follow-up for the efficacy 
assessment. 
 If patients are lost to follo w-up, the CRF must be complete d up to the last visit or 
contact.  
12. STATISTICS 
12.1. Analysis Populations 
12.1.1. Randomized Population 
The randomized population will incl ude all patients who sign the informed consent form and 
are assigned a randomization number at Visit 2 (Day 0). 
12.1.2. Intent-to-Treat Population  
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) populati on will consist of all randomized  patients who take at least

analyses will be performed on the ITT population. 12.1.3. Per-Protocol Population 
The per-protocol (PP) population will include all ITT patients without any major protocol 
deviations, and who had ≥ 80% compliance with study drug while on treatment (up to 
discontinuation for patients whose treatment is terminated early). The per-protocol efficacy 
analysis for CV events will be restricted to each patient’s time on study drug plus [ADDRESS_1130886] one dos e of study drug. This is the same as the ITT 
population. 12.2. Statistical Methods 
Safety and efficacy variables will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods to be 
described in detail in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized 
before study unblinding. 
12.2.1. Patient Disposition and Demographic/Baseline Characteristics 
The numbers of patients screen ed, the number of patients randomized per treatment group 
(randomized population), and the number of patients in the ITT and PP populations by 
[CONTACT_816750]. 
For randomized patients who discontinued treat ment with study drug, the primary reason for 
discontinuation will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_1570].

provided by [CONTACT_816751] (e.g., age, sex, race, and 
ethnicity) and baseline characte ristics (e.g., body weight, height, and body mass index) in the 
ITT and PP populations. 
Demographic data and baseline characteristics will be compared among treatment groups for 
the ITT and PP population. Differences in demogr aphic and baseline characteristics will be 
tested using a chi-square test (for categorical variables) or a 1-way analysis of variance 
model with treatment as a fact or (for continuous variables). The p-values will be used as 
descriptive statistics, primar ily as an assessment of th e adequacy of randomization. 
12.2.2. Study Medication Exposure and Compliance 
The final compliance to study drug will be calculated  as the percent of doses taken relative to 
doses scheduled to be taken. Overall percent co mpliance will be calculated per patient in the 
ITT and PP populations and summarized by [CONTACT_816752] (n, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). 
12.2.3. Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_419148]/therapy verbatim terms will be coded using the latest version of the 
World Health Organization Drug Dictionary. The numbers and percentages of patients in each treatment group taking concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_816753]. 
12.2.4. Analysis of Efficacy 
For efficacy endpoints including CV events, only adjudicated events will be included in the final statistical analyses. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary Statistics 
Summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for the 
baseline and post-baseline measurements, the percent changes, or changes from baseline will be presented by [CONTACT_816754]. The 
summary statistics will include changes in body weight and body mass index from baseline 
by [CONTACT_35080]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any 
component of the composite of the following clinical events: 
 CV death, 
 Nonfatal MI (incl uding silent MI), 
 Nonfatal stroke, 
 Coronary revascularization,  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816572]/non-invasive testing. 
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be perf ormed using the log-rank test 
comparing the 2 treatment groups (AMR101 and placebo) and including the stratification 
factor “CV risk category”, use of ezetimibe and geographical region (Westernized, Eastern 
European, and Asia Pacific countries) (each as recorded in the IWR at the time of 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019

vs. placebo) from a Cox proportional hazard model that includes the stratification factor will 
also be reported, along with the associated 95%  confidence interval. Kaplan-Meier estimates 
from randomization to the time to the prim ary efficacy endpoint will be plotted.  
The size and direction of the treatment effects of the individual com ponents of the composite 
endpoint and their relative contribution to the com posite endpoint will be determined as well. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Endpoints 
The statistical analyses of the secondary endpoi nts will be analyzed by [CONTACT_816755]-rank test 
specified above for the primary efficacy endpoint . Treatment differences will be tested at 
alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_1130888] 
model and the associated 95% confidence interv als will also be pr ovided. Kaplan-Meier 
estimates from randomization the time to the secondary efficacy endpoints will be plotted. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tertiary Endpoints 
For event rates, the statistical analyses of the tertiary endpoints (s ee section 9.2.3) will be 
similar to the analysis of the secondary effi cacy endpoints. All tertiary analyses will be 
conducted for the ITT population. No adjustments for multiple testing will be made. 
For measurements of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], lipoproteins and in flammatory markers the change from baseline 
will be analyzed in the units of each marker, and the percent change from baseline. Since 
these biomarkers are typi[INVESTIGATOR_816622], the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be 
used for treatment comparisons of the per cent change from baseline, and medians and 
quartiles will be provided for each treatment group. The medians of the differences between 
the treatment groups and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated with the Hodges-Lehmann method. 
New onset diabetes is defined as Type 2 diabetes newly diagnosed during the 
treatment/follow-up period (i.e. pa tients with no history of diab etes at randomization, with 
the test as listed in Appendix C). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses of the primary and key second ary endpoints (as defined in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan) will be performed. All subgr oup analyses will be conducted for the ITT 
population. No adjustments for multiple testing will be made.  
Log-rank tests, treatment effects and the associated 95% confidence intervals for the primary 
and key secondary efficacy endpoints within each subgroup will be provided using the Cox 
proportional hazard model with treatment (AMR101 or  placebo), and stratif ication as a factor 
(with the exception of the subgroup analyses of those s ubgroup variables related to the 
stratification factors, i.e., CV risk category th at will not have stratification as a factor). 
Subgroups including, but not limited to the follo wing, will be explored.  A complete list will 
be prospectively defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

The consistency of the treatment effects in subgroups will be assessed for the primary and 
key secondary efficacy endpoints. For each subgroup variable, a Cox proportional hazard model with terms for treatment, stratificati on factors (with the exception of those subgroup 
variables related to the strati fication factors, i.e., CV risk  category), subgroup, and treatment-
by-subgroup interaction will be pe rformed. The main treatment effect will not be tested with 
this model. P-values for testing the interaction terms will be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Interim Efficacy Analysis 
One interim analysis will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint using best available 
data (adjudicated events and site reported e ndpoints) based on data when approximately 60% 
of the total number of primary endpoint events is reached. The interim analysis will be based 
on a group sequential design that includes earl y stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_816592] I error rate (O’Brien-Flemi ng). This allows for interim analysis and 
preserves the overall Type I error probability of α=0.[ADDRESS_1130889] been observed. According to this 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 69 of 110 boundary, the critical p-value at the interim an alysis has to be p<=0.0076, resulting in the 
final evaluation p-value of 0.0476.  
The interim results of the study will be monito red by [CONTACT_3153]. The analyses will 
be performed by [CONTACT_816807]. The 
results will be reported only to the DMC. The unblinded information will not be released to 
sponsor under any circumstance before the completion of the study. Specific statistical 
guidelines for data monitoring will be discus sed and formalized in a separate Interim 
Statistical Analysis Plan and DMC Charter. 
12.2.5. Analysis of Safety 
All analyses of safety will be conducted on the safety population, which is defined as all 
randomized patients who receive at least one dose of study drug. The safety assessment will 
be based on the frequency of adverse events, physical exams, vita l signs and safety 
laboratory tests. 
Adverse events with new onset during the study between the initia tion of study drug and 
[ADDRESS_1130890] dose of study drug for each patient will be considered treatment-
emergent (TEAEs). This will include any AE with onset prior to initiation of study drug and 
increased severity after the treatment initiation. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_72065], and by [CONTACT_3148]. This will include overall incidence rates (regardless of severity and relationship to study drug), and incidence rate s for moderate or severe adverse events. A 
summary of SAEs and adverse events leading to early discontinuation from the study will be 
presented through data listings. 
Safety laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_447]-treatment change from 
baseline for each of the parameters using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_1570]. Those 
patients with significant laboratory abnorma lities will be identified in data listings. 
Additional safety parameters will be summarized in data listings. 
12.3. Sample Size Determination 
Sample size estimation is based on the assumpti on that the primary composite endpoint (time 
from randomization to the first occurrence of  CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, 
coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916]) would be relatively 
reduced by 15%, from an event rate by 4 years of 23.6% in the placebo group to 20.5% in the 
AMR101 group. It is expected that a minimum of [ADDRESS_1130891] this difference at 4.76% significance level (because of the interim analysis described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and with 90% power, assuming an 18-month enrollment period and a median follow-up of 4 years. The current samp le size calculation is based on an estimated 
placebo yearly event rate of 5.9% (23.6% over 4 y ears). To protect against the possibility that 
the actual placebo event rate is lower than estimated, an extra 1000 patients will be enrolled (approximately 7990 patients in tota l). By [CONTACT_816720] 1000 pa tients, the event rate in the 
placebo group could be 5.2% per year (20.8% over 4 years) w ithout having to modify the 
other sample size assumptions.  
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 70 of 110 Since this is an events-driven trial, the ‘sample size’ is the number of events rather than the 
number of patients. The number of events that occur depends pr imarily on three factors: how 
many patients are enrolled, the combined group event rate, and how long the patients are 
followed. Because of the difficulty in predicti ng the combined event rate, the sponsor will 
monitor that event rate as the trial progresses.  If the combined event rate is less than 
anticipated, either increasing th e number of patients, extending the length of follow-up, or a 
balance of adjusting both factors may be necessary to achieve the sample size of [ADDRESS_1130892] 1 adjudicated, primary event (and 
appropriately accounting for patients with potential primary events for which the 
adjudication process is then incomplete) is consistent with projecti ons, then the study could 
continue toward the protocol-spe cified target enrollment of 7 990 patients.  However, if the 
number of such events appears less than, and inconsistent with projections, the Sponsor will 
consider (under blinded conditions) re-calcula ting the number of patients needed to achieve 
the target number of events within the desire d timeline or extend the follow-up period.  If the 
projected increase in nu mber of patients is ≤ 25% of the original 7990 target population, the 
Sponsor may, with documented approval of both the REDUCE-IT Steering Committee and 
the Data Monitoring Committee, extend enrollme nt to the revised ta rget number without 
need for an additional protocol amendment.    Under those cond itions, all principal 
investigators, ethics committees, and regulatory authorities associated with the protocol will 
be promptly notified of the action. Should the projected increase in number of patients be 
more than 25% above the original 7990 target ( i.e. more than 1998 additional patients) a 
formal protocol amendment will be initiated. 
If the number of patients to be studied is in creased, the enrollment pha se will be extended to 
allow enrollment of the additional patients. At completion of study enrollment, the actual nu mber of patients randomized may vary from 
the target number (either original  or revised) as a result of th e inherent lag between the date 
the last patient started sc reening and the date the la st patient was randomized.  
13. MONITORING, DATA MANAGEMEN T, AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] 
13.1. Data Management 
13.1.1. Data Handling 
Data will be recorded at the site on CR Fs. All entries on a CRF are ultimately the 
responsibility of the Investigator, who is expe cted to review each form for completeness and 
accuracy before signing. A CRF must be co mpleted for each randomized patient. The CRFs 
and source documents must be made availa ble to the Sponsor a nd/or its designee. 
13.2. Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_816593], originals or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_222497], relati ng to the conduct of this trial, and necessary for the evaluation and 
reconstruction of the clinical trial. This documentation includes, but is not limited to 
protocol, CRFs, AE reports, patie nt source data (including record s of patients, patient visit

Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 71 of 110 logs, clinical observations and findings), corr espondence with health authorities and IRB, 
consent forms, inventory of study product, Investig ator’s curriculum vitae, monitor visit logs, 
laboratory reference ranges and laboratory certification or qu ality control procedures, and 
laboratory director curriculum vitae. 
The Investigator and affiliated institution shoul d maintain the trial documents as required by 
[CONTACT_1729]. The Investigator a nd affiliated institution should take measures to 
prevent accidental or premature destruction of documents. Clinical trial documents must be 
kept in the clinical site’s archives indefinite ly, unless written authori zation is obtained from 
the Sponsor. 
14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 
The investigator and research institution agree that the Spons or, their representatives and 
designees, the IRB or IEC, and representatives from worldwide regulatory agencies will have 
the right, both during and after the clinical trial, to review and inspect pertinent medical 
records related to the clinical trial.  
15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
The Sponsor and/or its designee(s) will perform quality control and quality assurance checks 
of all clinical trials that it sponsors. Before  the enrollment of any patient in this study, the 
Sponsor or its designee will review with the investigator and site personnel the following 
documents: protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, CRFs and procedures for their completion, the 
informed consent process, and the procedur e for reporting SAEs. Site visits will be 
performed by [CONTACT_1052]/or its designees. During these vi sits, information recorded on 
the CRFs will be verified against source documents and requests for clarification or 
correction may be made. After the CRF data is  entered by [CONTACT_779], the Sponsor or designee 
will review for safety information, comple teness, accuracy, and logical consistency. 
Computer programs that identify data incons istencies may be used to help monitor the 
clinical trial. If necessary, requests for clarifica tion or correction will be sent to investigators. 
By [CONTACT_12142], the S ponsor agrees directly or th rough its designee(s) to be 
responsible for implementing and maintaining qu ality control and qual ity assurance systems 
with written standard operating procedures to ensure that tria ls are conducted and data are 
generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, accepted standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP),  International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and other 
applicable regulations. 
16. ETHICS AND GOOD CLINICAL  PRACTICE COMPLIANCE 
Good Clinical Practice is  an international ethical and sc ientific quality standard for 
designing, conducting, recording, and reporting trials that involve human patients. 
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well 
being of trial patients are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and th at the clinical trial data are credible. In this study, 
  
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 72 of 110  the 2008 version of the Declara tion of Helsinki will be adhered to. It can be found on the 
website of The World Medical Association: 
http://www.wma.net/en/30public ations/10policies/b3/17c.pdf  
17. INFORMED CONSENT 
Prior to participation in a study, the participant, or participant’s legal representative/impartial 
witness must sign an IRB/IEC- approved written informed consent form (ICF). The approved 
written informed consent must abide to all a pplicable laws in regards to the safety and 
confidentiality of the patients. To obtain and document informed consent, the Investigator 
should comply with applicable  regulations; adhere to GC P standards and the ethical 
principles in the Declaration of Helsinki (see Section 16). 
The language in the oral and written informa tion about the trial, including the written 
informed consent form should be as non-techni cal as practical and should be understandable 
to the participant or participant’s legal representative/impartial witness, where applicable. 
Before informed consent is obtained, the Inves tigator should provide the participant, or 
participant’s legal representative/impartial witness ample time and opportunity to inquire 
about the trial and to decide wh ether or not to  participate. 
All questions about the trial should be answered to the satisfaction of th e participant, or the 
participant’s legal representative/impartial witness. The written ICF should be signed and 
personally dated by [CONTACT_82976]’s legal representative/impartial witness, and by [CONTACT_28490]. Participants will be informed that participation is voluntary  and that he/she can withdraw  from the study at any time. A 
signed copy of the consent form must be given to the participant, and this fact will be 
documented in the CRF. 
Of special concern regarding informed consent is the collection of blood samples for genetic 
analysis. Local regulations may not allow the co llection of blood samples for genetic testing 
or the shipment of blood samples for genetic te sting outside the region. In these cases, blood 
samples for genetic testing will not be collected, and the portion of the ICF describing the 
genetic component of the study will not be included. If blood samples for genetic testing will be collected, the ICF will clea rly indicate that a sample will be drawn for this purpose, but 
that the participant has the right to refuse this procedure. 
18. PUBLICATION POLICY  
The Steering Committee (SC) is responsible fo r the reporting and pub lication of the study 
results. The Sponsor will be provided a reason able opportunity to review such manuscripts 
prior to journal submission. The results of the study will be published irrespective of whether 
the endpoints are met, or whether the resu lts are regarded positive or negative. 
 
Confidentiality, publication, and patent appl ications related to unpublished study-related 
information and unpublished information given to  the site investigat ors by [CONTACT_63307]/or its designee(s) shall be handled as set forth in the Clinical Trial Agreement.

Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 73 of 110 19. FINANCING AND INSURANCE 
19.1. Finances 
Prior to starting the study, the Principal Inves tigator and/or institution will sign a Clinical 
Trial Agreement with the Sponsor and/or its designee(s). This agreement will include the 
financial information agreed upon by [CONTACT_46954]. 
19.2. Insurance Compensation 
The Sponsor certifies that it has taken out a li ability insurance policy covering all clinical 
trials under its sponsorship. Th is insurance policy is in a ccordance with local laws and 
requirements. The insurance of the Sponsor doe s not relieve the inves tigator and the other 
collaborators from maintaining their own liabi lity insurance policy. An insurance certificate 
will be provided to the IRB/IEC and Competen t Authority according to country specific 
regulatory requirements. 
20. COMPLETION OF STUDY 
The end of the study will be at the time of the la st patient-last visit of the follow-up period of 
the study. The IRB and IEC will be notified about the end of the study according to country-
specific regulatory requirements. 
21. STUDY ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION 
21.1. Protocol Amendments 
Any amendments to the study protocol consider ed to be a substantial amendment will be 
communicated to the investigator by [CONTACT_39987]. All substantial protocol 
amendments will undergo the same review and a pproval process as the original protocol and 
may be implemented after it has been appr oved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and Competent Authority, 
unless immediate implementation of the change is necessary for patient safety. In this case, 
the situation must be documented and reporte d to the IRB/IEC and Competent Authority 
according to all relevant country-specific regulatory requirements. 
A protocol amendment is considered to be a substantial amendment if it is likely to affect the 
safety, physical, or mental integrity of patients in the study; the scientific value of the study; 
the conduct or management of th e study; or the quality or safety of any IMP used in the 
study. 
Any other minor changes to the protocol not co nsidered to be substantial amendments will 
not need prior approval of the IRB/IEC and Competent Authority and will be communicated 
to the investigator by [CONTACT_4885].

EVENTS IN CARDIOVASCULAR TRIALS

Standardized Data Collection for Cardiovascular Trials Initiative.  Standardized Definitions 
for End Point Events in Card iovascular Trials, May 31, 2011. 
 
23.1. Definition of Cardiovascular Death 
Cardiovascular death includes death resulting from an acute myocardial infarction, sudden 
cardiac death, death due to conges tive heart failure (CHF), death due to stroke, death due to 
cardiovascular (CV) procedures , death due to CV hemorrhage,  and death due to other 
cardiovascular causes. 
 Classifying CV mortality more specifically (MI,  sudden death etc.) is usually not needed for 
outcome trials.  In general, such classificati on is difficult because th e classifications refer 
both to underlying cause (e.g., acute MI) and to mode of death (sudden/arrhythmic, 
progression of CHF).  The following definitions can, however, be used if desired. 
 
1. Death due to Acute Myocardial Infarction  refers to a death by [CONTACT_816767] 
(arrhythmia, CHF) within 30 days after a MI related to the immediate consequences of 
the MI, such as progressive CHF or recalcitrant arrhythmia.   
 
Mortal events that occur af ter a “break” (e.g., a CHF and a rrhythmia-free period of at 
least a week) should be classifi ed as CV or non-CV death, and if classified as a CV death, 
should be attributed to the immediate cause , even though the MI may have increased the 
risk of that event (e.g., the risk  of arrhythmic death is incr eased for many months after an 
acute MI).   
 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 83 of 110 
 Acute MI should be verified to the extent possible by [CONTACT_816809] (see Chapter 4, Universal Definition of MI) or by [CONTACT_816810]. 
 Death resulting from a procedure to treat a MI  (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_10956] (CABG)), or to treat a compli cation resulting from 
MI, should also be considered  death due to acute MI.   
 Death resulting from an electiv e coronary procedure to treat myocardial ischemia (i.e., 
chronic stable angina) or death due to a MI th at occurs as a direct  consequence of a CV 
investigation/procedure/operation should be cons idered as a death due to a CV procedure. 
 2. Sudden Cardiac Death  refers to a death that occurs  unexpectedly, not following an 
acute acute MI, and includes the following deaths: 
a. Death witnessed and instantaneous w ithout new or worsening symptoms 
b. Death witnessed within [ADDRESS_1130899] an acute MI 
c. Death witnessed and attributed  to an identified arrhyt hmia (e.g., captured on an 
electrocardiographic (ECG) recording, w itnessed on a monitor, or unwitnessed 
but found on implantable cardiov erter-defibrillator review) 
d. Death after unsuccessful resu scitation from cardiac arrest 
e. Death after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest and without identification 
of a non-cardiac etiology 
f. Unwitnessed death without other cause of death (i nformation regarding the 
patient’s clinical status preceding deat h should be provided, if available) 
 
General Considerations 
A subject seen alive and clinically stable 12-24 hours prior to being found dead 
 without any evidence or information of  a specific cause of  death should be 
 classified as “sudden cardiac death.”

Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 84 of 110 
 Deaths for which there is no information beyond “Patient found dead at home” may 
be classified as “death due to other cardiovascular causes” or in some trials, 
“undetermined cause of deat h.” Please see Definition of Undetermined Cause of 
Death, for full details.  
3. Death due to Congestive Heart Failure refers to a death in association with clinically 
worsening symptoms and/or signs of heart fail ure (see Definition of Heart Failure Event).  
Deaths due to heart failure can have various etiologies, in cluding single or recurrent 
myocardial infarctions, ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, or 
valvular disease.  
4. Death due to Stroke refers to death after a stroke that is either a direct consequence of the stroke or a complication of the stroke.   Ac ute stroke should be verified to the extent 
possible by [CONTACT_816811] (see Definition of Transient 
Ischemic Attack and Stroke). 
 
5. Death due to Cardiovascular Procedures refers to death caused by [CONTACT_816812] a cardiac procedure. 
 
6. Death due to Cardiovascular Hemorrhage refers to death relate d to hemorrhage such 
as a non-stroke intracranial hemorrhage (see De finition of Transient Ischemic Attack and 
Stroke), non-procedural or non-traumatic vasc ular rupture (e.g., aort ic aneurysm), or 
hemorrhage causing cardiac tamponade.   
 
7. Death due to Other Cardiovascular Causes refers to a CV deat h not included in the 
above categories (e.g., pulmonary embolis m or peripheral arterial disease). 
23.2. Definition of Non-Cardiovascular Death 
 
Non-cardiovascular death  is defined as any death that is not thought to be due to a 
cardiovascular cause. Detailed recommendations on the classification of non-cardiovascular 
causes of death are beyond the sc ope of this document. The leve l of detail required and the 
optimal classification will depe nd on the nature of the study population and the anticipated 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #[ADDRESS_1130900] of non-
cardiovascular* causes of death:  
 Pulmonary 
 Renal 
 Gastrointestinal 
 Hepatobiliary 
 Pancreatic 
 Infection (includes sepsis) 
 Non-infectious (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)) 
 Hemorrhage that is neither cardi ovascular bleeding nor a stroke  
 Accidental (e.g., physical accidents or drug overdoses) or trauma  
 Suicide 
 Prescription Drug Error (e.g., prescribed drug overdose, use of inappropriate drug, or drug-drug interaction) 
 Neurological process that is not a stroke or hemorrhage 
 Other non-CV 
 Malignancy 
Malignancy should be coded as the cause of death if: 
o Death results directly from the cancer; or 
o Death results from a concurrent illness that  could be a consequence of a cancer or 
o Death results from withdrawal of  other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816624] 
o Death results from an illness that  is not a consequence of a cancer 
Cancer deaths may arise from cancers that were present prior to randomization or which 
developed subsequently. It  may be helpful to distinguish thes e two scenarios (i.e. worsening of 
prior malignancy; new malignancy). 
 Suggested categorization in cludes common organ systems, hematologic, or unknown.

 23.3. Definition of Undetermined Cause of Death 
 
Undetermined Cause of Death  refers to a death not attrib utable to one of the above 
categories of cardiovascular death or to a non-cardiovascular cause. Inability to classify the 
cause of death may be due to lack of inform ation (e.g., the only available information is 
“patient died”) or when there is insufficient supporting information or detail to assign the 
cause of death. In general, the use of this ca tegory of death should be discouraged and should 
apply to a minimal number of patients in well-run clinical trials. A common analytic approach for cause of death analyses is to assume that all undetermined 
cases are included in the cardiovascular category (e.g., presumed cardiovascular death, specifically “death due to other cardiovascul ar causes”). Neverthe less, the appropriate 
classification and analysis of undetermined causes of death depends on the population, the 
intervention under investigation, and the di sease process. The approach should be 
prespecified and described in the protocol and other trial docum entation such as the end point 
adjudication procedures and/or the statistical analysis plan. 
 
23.4. Definition of Myocardial Infarction 
1. General Considerations 
The term myocardial infarc tion (MI) should be used wh en there is evidence of 
myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting cons istent with myocardial ischemia. 
In general, the diagnosis of MI requires the combination of:  
 Evidence of myocardial necros is (either changes in cardiac 
biomarkers or postmortem  pathological findings); and  
 Supporting information derived fr om the clinical presentation, 
electrocardiographic  changes, or the results of myocardial or 
coronary artery imaging  
The totality of the clinical, electro cardiographic, and cardiac biomarker 
information should be  considered to determine whether or not a MI has 
occurred. Specifically, timing and trends in  cardiac biomarkers and 
electrocardiographic information require careful analysis. The adjudication of 
MI should also take into account the clin ical setting in which the event occurs.   
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #[ADDRESS_1130901] definition because biom arker or electrocardiographic 
results are not available. 
2. Criteria for Myocardial Infarction 
a. Clinical Presentation 
The clinical presentation should be consistent with diagnosis of myocardial 
ischemia  and infarction. Other findings that might support the diagnosis of MI 
should be take into account because a number of conditions are associated 
with elevations in cardiac  biomarkers (e.g., trauma, surgery, pacing, ablation, 
congestive heart failure,  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, 
severe pulmonary hypertension,  stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
infiltrative and inflamma tory disorders of cardiac  muscle, drug toxicity, burns, 
critical illness, extreme exertion, and chronic kidney  disease). Supporting 
information can also be consider ed from myocardial imaging and  coronary 
imaging. The totality of the data may help differentiate acute MI from the  
background disease process.  
b. Biomarker Elevation For cardiac biomarkers, laboratories s hould report an upper reference limit 
(URL). If  the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit (URL) from the 
respective laboratory  performing the assay is not av ailable, then the URL for 
myocardial necrosis from the  laboratory should be used. If the 99th percentile 
of the URL or the URL for myocardial  necrosis is not available, the MI 
decision limit for the partic ular laboratory should be  used as the URL. 
Laboratories can also report both the 99th percentile  of the upper reference 
limit and the MI decision limit. Reference limits from the laboratory  
performing the assay are preferred over  the manufacturer’s listed reference 
limits in an  assay’s instructions for use. CK-MB and troponin  are preferred, 
but CK may be used in  the absence of CK-MB and troponin.  
 
For MI subtypes, different biomarker el evations for CK, CK-MB, or troponin 
will be required. The specific criteria w ill be referenced to the URL.

Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 88 of 110 
  
In many studies, particularly those in  which patients present acutely to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816625], it is not practical to stipulate the use 
of a single biomarker or  assay, and the locally available results are to be used 
as the basis for adjudication.  However, if possible, using the same cardiac 
biomarker assay and preferably, a core  laboratory, for all measurements 
reduces inter-assay variability.  
 Since the prognostic significance of differe nt types of myocardial infarctions 
(e.g., periprocedural myocardial infarcti on versus spontaneous myocardial 
infarction) may be  different, consider evaluating outcomes for these subsets of 
patients separately. 
 
c. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Changes 
Electrocardiographic changes can be us ed to support or confirm a MI. 
Supporting  evidence may be ischemic changes and confirmatory information 
may be new Q waves. 
 
 Criteria for acute myocardial ischemia (in absence of left 
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and left bundle branch block 
(LBBB)) : 
 
o ST elevation  
New ST elevation at the J point in two anatomically contiguous 
leads with the  cut-off points: ≥ 0.2 mV in men (> 0.25 mV in 
men < 40 years) or ≥  0.15 mV in  women in leads V2-V3 and/or 
≥ 0.[ADDRESS_1130902] depression ≥ 0.05 mV in two contiguous  leads;

23.5. Common Classification Schemes for Myocardial Infarction Categories 
For some trials, categorization of MI end points may be helpful or necessary using one or more of the classification schemes below: 
1. By [CONTACT_816772]: 
a. Clinical Classification of Differen t Types of Myocardial Infarction 
 Type 1 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019

Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 93 of 110 
 Spontaneous myocardial infarction related to ischemia due to a 
primary coronary event such as plaque erosion and/or rupture, 
fissuring, or dissection 
 
 Type 2 
Myocardial infarction secondary to ischemia due to either increased 
oxygen demand or decreased supply, e.g., coronary artery spasm, 
coronary embolism, anemia, arrhythmias, hypertension, or hypotension  
 Type [ADDRESS_1130907] elevation, or new LBBB, or evidence of fresh

2. By [CONTACT_816776]: 
 ST-Elevation MI (STEMI) 
o Additional subcategories may include:  
 Q-wave  
 Non-Q-wave  
 Unknown (no ECG or ECG not interpretable) 
 Non-ST-Elevation MI (NSTEMI) 
o Additional subcategories may include:  
 Q-wave  
 Non-Q-wave  
 Unknown (no ECG or ECG not interpretable) 
 Unknown (no ECG or ECG not interpretable) 
*All events adjudicated as MI will be  classified as STEMI, NSTEMI, 
or Unknown; however, it is acknowle dged that a significant proportion 
of peri-procedural (PCI or CABG) events may have missing, 
inadequate or uninterpretable ECG documentation.  
3. By [CONTACT_816777] (per Universal MI Definition): 
The magnitude of cardiac biomarker elevati on can be calculated as a ratio of the peak  
biomarker value divided by [CONTACT_941] 99th percentile URL.   
 The biomarker elevation can be provided for various MI subtypes, as shown in the example  below.

** For the sake of completeness, the total distribution of biomarker values should be 
reported. The hatched areas represent biom arker elevations below the decision limit 
used for these types of myocardial infarction. 
23.6. Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816627]  
 
1. Ischemic discomfort (angina, or symptoms thought to be equivalent) ≥ 10 minutes in 
duration occurring 
 at rest, or 
 in an accelerating pattern with frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_816628]. 
AND 
2. Prompting an unscheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] [ADDRESS_1130908] a 24* hour stay (or a date change if the time of 
admission/discharge is not available). 
 
AND 
3. At least one of the following: 
a. New or worsening ST or T wave changes on resting ECG (in the absence of 
confounders, such as LBBB or LVH) 
 Transient ST elevation ( duration < 20 minutes) 
New ST elevation at the J point in  two anatomically contiguous leads 
with the cut-off points:  ≥ 0.2 mV in men (> 0.25 mV in men < 40

 years) or ≥  0.15 mV in women in leads V2-V3 and/or ≥ 0.1 mV in 
other leads 
 ST depression and T-wave changes 
New horizontal or down- slopi[INVESTIGATOR_345482] ≥ 0.05 mV in two 
contiguous leads; and/ or new T inversion ≥ 0.1 mV in two contiguous 
leads. 
 
b. Definite evidence of inducible myocar dial ischemia as demonstrated by:  
 an early positive exercise stress test, defined as ST elevation or ≥  [ADDRESS_1130909] 
depression prior to 5 mets  
OR  
 stress echocardiography (reversible wall motion abnormality)  OR 
 myocardial scintigraphy (re versible perf usion defect),  OR 
 MRI (myocardial perfusion defici t under pharmacologic stress). 
  
c. Angiographic evidence of new or worse ≥ 70% lesion and/or thrombus in an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_816629]/signs. 
 
d. Need for coronary revascularization pro cedure (PCI or CABG) for the presumed 
culprit lesion(s).  This criterion would be fulfilled if revascularization was 
undertaken during the unscheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838], or subsequent to transfer to 
another institution without in terceding home discharge. 
 
AND 
 
4. Negative cardiac biomarkers a nd no evidence of acute MI  
 
General Considerations 
1. Escalation of pharmacotherapy for ischemia, such as intravenous nitrates or 
increasing  dosages of β-blockers, should be considered supportive of the diagnosis of 
unstable angina.  However, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_816630], without any of the additional findings listed under 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 97 of 110 
 category 3, would be insufficient alone to support classification as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148842].  
2. If subjects are admitted with suspected unstable angina, and subsequent testing 
reveals a noncardiac  or non-ischemic etiology, this ev ent should not be recorded as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929]. Potential ischemic events meeting the criteria for 
myocardial infarction  should not be adjudicate d as unstable angina.  
3. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816631] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1086] r unstable angina.  For example,  
 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a patient  with stable exertional angina for coronary 
angiography and PCI that is prompted by a positive outpatient stress test 
should not be considered hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929]. 
 
 Rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a patient meeting th e criteria for unstable angina who was 
stabilized, discharged, and subsequently  readmitted for reva scularization, does 
not constitute a second hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929] 
4. A patient who undergoes an elective catheteri zation where incidental  coronary artery 
disease is found and who subsequently under goes coronary revascul arization will not 
be considered as meeting the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816632].  
 
23.7. Definition of Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke 
 
Transient Ischemic Attack 
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a transient epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (< 24 hours) of neurological 
dysfunction caused by [CONTACT_816815], sp inal cord, or retinal ischem ia, without acute infarction. 
 
Stroke 
Stroke is defined as an acut e epi[INVESTIGATOR_816633], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or re tinal vascular injury.  
Classification: 
1. Ischemic Stroke 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 98 of 110 
 Ischemic stroke is defined as an acute ep isode of focal cerebral, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], or retinal  
dysfunction caused by [CONTACT_816816].  
Hemorrhage may be a consequence of ischemic stroke. In this situation, the stroke is 
an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation and not a hemorrhagic stroke.  
2. Hemorrhagic Stroke 
Hemorrhagic stroke is defined as an acute ep isode of focal or global cerebral or spi[INVESTIGATOR_816634] a nontraumatic intr aparenchymal, intraventricular, or 
subarachnoid  hemorrhage.   
NOTE: Microhemorrhages seen on T2-weighted  MRI imaging, subdural and epi[INVESTIGATOR_816635].  
3. Undetermined Stroke Undetermined stroke is defined as an acu te epi[INVESTIGATOR_256817], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retinal vascular injury as a 
result of hemorrhage or infarction but with insufficient information to allow  
categorization as ischemic or hemorrhagic. 
 
 Stroke Disability 
Stroke disability should be measured by a reliab le and valid scale in all cases, typi[INVESTIGATOR_816636] 90 days after the event. For example, the modified Rankin Scale may be used 
to address this requirement: 
 
 
Additional Considerations 
In trials involving patients with stroke, evidence of vascular central nervous system injury 
without recognized neurologi cal dysfunction may be observed. Examples include 

Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #[ADDRESS_1130910] of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916] (a required co mponent of this end 
point and defined below), as well as urgent  outpatient visits (optional component). 
Depending on the trial, there may be interest in capturing all heart failure (HF) events; 
however, HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816637]. If urgent visits are 
included in the HF event endpoint, the number of  urgent visits need s to be explicitly 
presented separately from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
 
A Heart Failure Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816638]:   
1) The patient is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a primary diagnosis of HF  
 
2) The patient’s length-of-stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816639] 24 hours (or a change in 
calendar date if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_118950]) 
 3) The patient exhibits documented new or worsening symptoms due to HF on presentation, including at least  ONE  of the following:  
 
a. Dyspnea (dyspnea with exertion, dyspnea at rest, orthopnea , paroxysmal 
nocturnal dyspnea)  
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 100 of 110 
 b. Decreased exercise tolerance  
c. Fatigue 
d.  Other symptoms of worsened end-or gan perfusion or volume overload (must 
be specified and desc ribed by [CONTACT_760]) 
 
4) The patient has objective evidence of new or worsening HF, consisting of at least 
TWO  physical examination findings OR one physical examination finding and at 
least ONE  laboratory criterion), including:  
a. Physical examination findings considered to be due to heart failure, including 
new or worsened:  
i. Peripheral edema  
ii. Increasing abdominal distention or as cites (in the absence of primary 
hepatic disease) 
iii. Pulmonary rales/crackles/crepi[INVESTIGATOR_575741]. Increased jugular venous pressure and/or hepatojugular reflux  
v. S3 gallop  
vi. Clinically significant or rapid weight gain thought to be related to fluid 
retention 
 
b. Laboratory evidence of new or worseni ng HF, if obtained within 24 hours of 
presentation, including: 
i. Increased B-type natriuretic peptid e (BNP)/ N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-
proBNP) concentrations consistent w ith decompensation of heart failure 
(such as BNP > 500 pg/mL or NT-proBNP > 2,000 pg/mL). In patients 
with chronically elevated natriuretic peptides, a significant increase should 
be noted above baseline.  
 
ii. Radiological evidence of pulmonary congestion 
 
iii. Non-invasive or invasive  diagnostic evidence of clinically significant 
elevated left- or right-sided ventricular filling pressure or low cardiac

(TVI)) OR right heart catheterization showing a pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_171438] (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) ≥ 18 mmHg, central 
venous pressure ≥  12 mmHg, or a cardiac index < 2.2 L/min/m2 
 
Note: All results from diagnostic test s should be reported, if available, 
even if they do not meet the above criteria, because they provide 
important information for the ad judication of these events.  
 
5) The patient receives initiation or intensif ication of treatment specifically for HF, 
including at least ONE of the following: 
a. Significant augmentation in oral diuretic therapy  
b. Intravenous diuretic, inotr ope, or vasodilator therapy  
c. Mechanical or surgical intervention, including: 
i. Mechanical circulatory support (e.g., intra-aortic balloon pump, 
ventricular assist device) 
ii. Mechanical fluid removal (e.g., ultraf iltration, hemofiltration, dialysis)  
 
New Heart Failure/Heart Failure Not Requiring Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: 
 
An Urgent Heart Failure Visit  is defined as an event that meets all of the following:  
 
1) The patient has an urgent, unscheduled offi ce/practice or emergency department visit 
for a primary diagnosis of HF, but not meeting the crit eria for a HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
2) All signs and symptoms for HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816640] A Heart 
Failure Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816641]. 
3) The patient receives initiation or intensifi cation of treatment specifically for HF, as

 23.9. Interventional Cardiology Definitions 
A.  Clinical Definitions  
1. Clinically-Driven Target Lesion Revascularization :  Revascularization is 
clinically-driven if the target lesion di ameter stenosis is > 50% by [CONTACT_816817] (QCA) and the subjec t has clinical or functional ischemia 
which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_816818].  Clinical 
or functional ischemia includes any of the following: 
a. A history of angina pectoris, presum ably related to the target vessel 
b. Objective signs of ischemia at rest (e lectrocardiographic changes) or during 
exercise test (or equivalent), presumably related to the target vessel 
c. Abnormal results of any invasive functi onal diagnostic test [e.g., coronary flow 
reserve (CFR) or fractional flow reserve (FFR)] 
Comment :  Target lesion revascularization of a > 70% diameter stenosis by [CONTACT_816819]-driven. 
Comment :  In the absence of QCA data or if a < 50% stenosis is present, TLR may be 
considered clinically-driven by [CONTACT_34164] (CEC) if severe ischemic signs and symptoms attributed  to the target lesion are present. 
 
2. Non-Target Lesion and Non-Target Lesion Revascularization:  A lesion for which 
revascularization is not attempted or one in which revascularization is performed 
using a non-study device, respectively. 
 
3. Non-Target Vessel and Non-Target Vessel Revascularization :  A vessel for which 
revascularization is not attempted or one in which revascularization is performed 
using a non-study device, respectively. 
 
4. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Status: 
 a. Elective :  The procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis or during a 
subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] w ithout significant risk of myocardial infarction (MI) 
or death.  For stable in-p atients, the procedure is being performed during this 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816642]'s clinical situation demands the procedure prior to discharge.  
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 103 of 110 
  
b. Urgent:   The procedure should be performed on an inpatient basis and prior to 
discharge because of significant concerns  that there is risk of myocardial 
ischemia, MI, and/or death. Patients w ho are outpatients or in the emergency 
department at the time that the cardiac cat heterization is requested would warrant 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575720].     
                                                          
c. Emergency :  The procedure should be performe d as soon as possible because of 
substantial concerns that ongoing myocardial ischemia and/or MI could lead to 
death.  "As soon as possible" refers to a patient who is of sufficient acuity that one 
would cancel a scheduled case to perform th is procedure immediately in the next 
available room during business hours, or one would activate th e on-call team were 
this to occur during off-hours. 
 
d. Salvage:   The procedure is a last resort. The patient is in cardiogenic shock when 
the PCI begins (i.e., the time at which the first guide wire or intracoronary device 
is introduced into a coronary artery or  by[CONTACT_816820]) OR within the last ten minutes prior to the start of the case or 
during the diagnostic portion of the case, the patient has also received chest 
compressions or has been on unanticipated circulatory support  (e.g., intra-aortic 
balloon pump, extracorporeal mechani cal oxygenation, or cardiopulmonary 
support). 
 
5. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI):  Placement of an angioplasty guide 
wire, balloon, or other device (e.g., sten t, atherectomy catheter, brachytherapy 
delivery device, or thrombectomy catheter) into a native coronary artery or coronary 
artery by[CONTACT_816821].  In the 
assessment of the severity of coronary lesions with the use of intravascular 
ultrasound, CFR, or FFR, insertion of a gui de wire will NOT be considered PCI. 
 
6. Procedural Success :  Achievement of < 30 % residual di ameter stenosis of the target 
lesion assessed by [CONTACT_816822]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256822] (MACE, a composite of death, MI, or repeat coronary reva scularization of the 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 104 of 110 
 target lesion).  Ideally, the assessment of  the residual stenosis at the end of the 
procedure should be performed by [CONTACT_256911]. 
 
Comment:  For some device interventions (e .g., balloon angioplasty), achievement of  
< 50% diameter stenosis by [CONTACT_816823]. 
 
7. Target Lesion :  Any lesion treated or attempted to  be treated during the PCI with the 
study device.  The target lesion includes th e arterial segment treated with the study 
device (stent, in most cases) plus 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal  to the treatment 
site. 
 
8. Target Lesion Failure (TLF):   The composite of ischemia-driven revascularization 
of the target lesion, MI related to the targ et vessel, or cardiac death related to the 
target vessel.  If it cannot be determined with certainty whether the MI or death was 
related to the target vessel, it is considered a TLF. 
 
9. Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR):   Any repeat percutaneous intervention of 
the target lesion (including 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to th e target lesion) or 
surgical by[CONTACT_816824].  In the assessment of TLR, angiograms should be assessed 
by [CONTACT_816825] (if designated) and made  available to the CEC for 
review upon request. 
 
10. Target Vessel :  A major native coronary artery (e .g., left main coronary artery, left 
anterior descending coronary ar tery, left circumflex coronary  artery, or right coronary 
artery) or by[CONTACT_816826].  A native coronary artery target 
vessel includes the arterial segments upstream and downstream to the target lesion 
plus major side branches. 
 
11. Target Vessel Failure (TVF):   The composite of ischemia-driven revascularization 
of the target vessel, MI related to the target vessel, or cardiac death related to the 
Amarin Pharma Inc. Protocol AMR-01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 105 of 110 
 target vessel.  If it cannot be determined with certainty whether the MI or death was 
related to the target vessel, it is considered a TVF. 
 
12. Target Vessel, Non-Target Lesion, a nd Target Vessel, Non-Target Lesion 
Revascularization:   Any lesion or revascularization of a lesion in the target vessel 
other than the target  lesion, respectively. 
 
13. Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR):  Any repeat percutaneous intervention or 
surgical by[CONTACT_816827].  In the assessment of TVR, 
angiograms should be assessed by [CONTACT_256911] (if designated) and 
made available to the CEC for review upon request. 
 
14. Vascular Complications:  
 Access site hematoma 
 Arteriovenous fistula 
 Peripheral ischemia 
 Peripheral nerve injury 
 Pseudoaneurysm 
 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage 
 
23.10. Definition of Peripheral Vascular Intervention 
 
1. Peripheral Vascular Intervention (PVI):   Peripheral vascular intervention is a catheter-
based or open surgical procedure designed to improve peripheral arterial or venous blood 
flow or otherwise modify or revise vascular  conduits.  Procedures may include, but are 
not limited to, balloon angioplasty, stent placement, thrombectomy, embolectomy, 
atherectomy, dissection repair, aneurysm ex clusion, treatment of dialysis conduits, 
placement of various devices, in travascular thrombolysis or other pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 
open surgical by[CONTACT_576335].   
 
In general, the intention to perform percutaneous  peripheral vascular intervention is 
denoted by [CONTACT_434338] a guide wire  into a peripheral artery or vein.

The target vessel(s) and the type of revasc ularization procedure (e.g., surgical by[CONTACT_6476], 
thrombectomy, endarterectomy, percutaneous angioplasty, stent placement, thromboembolectomy, and thrombolysis) should be specified and recorded.  For the sake 
of simplicity, this definition applies to the extracranial carotid artery and other non-
cardiac arteries and veins and excludes th e intracranial vessels and lymphatics. 
 
2. Procedural Success :  In the case of percutaneous intervention for obstructive lesions, 
procedural success is defined as the achievem ent of a satisfactory final residual diameter 
stenosis by [CONTACT_816828] (and without flow limiting dissection 
or hemodynamically significant translesional pressure gradient ).  The specific parameter 
for final percent residual stenosis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_816643] < 30% and < 50%; selection of the 
appropriate percentage may va ry depending upon the specific  intervention applied, the 
vascular territory, and anticipated or desired therapeuti c response.  Procedural success 
also implies absence of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816644] (e.g., death, stroke, myocardial 
infarction, acute onset of limb ischemia, need  for urgent/emergent vascular surgery, and 
other procedure-specific major adverse events). The balloon in flation, stent placement, or 
other therapeutic intervention may be pr eceded by [CONTACT_576337] (e.g., 
percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, direct ional or rotational atherectomy, laser, and 
chronic total occlusion crossing device ), as predefined in the protocol. 
 
3. Procedural Status:  Non- Elective and Elective:  
 
a. Non-Elective :  Non-elective procedures include em ergent and urgent procedures. A 
non-elective procedure is a procedure that is performed without delay, because there 
is clinical consensus that  the procedure should occur imminently.  Non-elective 
procedures imply a degree of instability of the patient, urgency of the medical 
condition, or instability of the threatening lesion.  
 
 Emergent:  A procedure that is performed im mediately because of the acute 
nature of the medical condition (e.g., acute limb ischemia, acute aortic dissection), 
and the increased morbidity or mortality associated with a temporal delay in 
treatment.

Amendment #1 16 May 2013 Page 107 of 110 
  
 Urgent :  An urgent procedure is one that is  not emergent but required to be 
performed on a timely basis ( ≤ 24 hrs) (e.g., a patient who has been stabilized 
following initial treatment of  acute limb ischemia, and th ere is clinical consensus 
that a definitive procedure should occur within the next 24 hours). 
 
b. Elective: An elective procedure is one that is scheduled and is performed on a patient 
with stable disease, or in whom there is  no urgency and/or increased morbidity or 
mortality associated with a planned procedure. 
 
1. Target Lesion : A target lesion is any lesion treate d or attempted to be treated during 
the trial procedure with the index device. The target lesion is the treated segment 
starting 5 mm proximal and e nding 5 mm distal to the i ndex device (stent, in most 
cases). 
2. Target Vessel:  A target vessel is any vessel (e.g.,  non-cardiac or non-cerebrovascular 
vessel) that contains the targ et lesion treated with the study device. The target vessel 
includes the target lesion as well as the en tire vessel upstream and downstream to the 
target lesion, including side branches (native vessel). 
3. Non-Target Lesion:  A non-target lesion is one for which revascularization is not 
attempted or one in which revascularizat ion is performed using a non-study device. 
4. Non-Target Vessel : A non-target vessel is one for which revascularization is not 
attempted or one in which revascularizat ion is performed using a non-study device. 
5. Target Vessel, Non-Target Lesion : Any lesion or revasculari zation of a lesion in the 
target vessel other th an the target lesion. 
6. Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR):  Target lesion revascularization is any 
repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesions (including 5 mm proximal and 
distal to the index device) or surgical  by[CONTACT_816829]. In the assessment of TLR, 
angiograms should be assessed by [CONTACT_256911] (if designated) and 
made available to the Clinical E nd Points Committee (CEC) for review.

 7. Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR ): Target vessel revascularization is any 
repeat percutaneous intervention or surg ical by[CONTACT_478191]. In the assessment of TVR, angiogr ams should be assessed by [CONTACT_816830] (if designated) and made available to the CEC for review. 
8.  Clinically-Driven Target Lesion Revascularization : Clinically-driven target lesion 
revascularization is a target lesion revascul arization prompted by [CONTACT_816831] (intermittent claudication, critical limb ischemia) or objective 
imaging evidence of target lesion reste nosis (i.e., most commonly with duplex 
ultrasonography). In the assessment of c linically driven TLR based on duplex 
ultrasonography, ultrasonographic images s hould be assessed by a duplex ultrasound 
core laboratory (if designated) and made available to the CEC for review. 
23.11. Definition of Any Revascularization Procedure  
Any revascularization includes a ny arterial vascular interventi on done to treat ischemia or 
prevent major ischemic events, including perc utaneous or surgical intervention of the 
coronary, peripheral, or carotid arteries. Aneurysm repairs, diss ection repairs, arterial-venous 
fistula or graft placement or repairs, or renal arterial intervention for hypertension or renal 
dysfunction are not included.  
23.12. Definition of Cardiac Arrhythm ia Requiring Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816645] w ithin [ADDRESS_1130912] epi[INVESTIGATOR_816646], including any one of the following: 
1. Atrial arrhythmia – atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supr aventricular tachycardia that 
requires cardio-version, drug therapy, or is  sustained for greater than 1 minute) 
2. Ventricular arrhythmia - Ve ntricular tachycardia or vent ricular fibrillation requiring 
cardio-version and/or intr avenous anti-arrhythmics 
3. Bradyarrhythmia - High-level AV block (def ined as third-degree AV block or second-
degree AV block), junctional or ventricular escape rhythm, or  severe sinus bradycardia

 (typi[INVESTIGATOR_816647] < 30 bpm).  The bradycar dia must require temporary or permanent 
pacing,  
23.13. Definition of Cardiac Arrest (Sudden Cardiac Death)  
A sudden, unexpected death due to the cessati on of cardiac mechanical  activity, confirmed 
by [CONTACT_12204] a detectable pulse, unres ponsiveness, and apnea (or agonal, gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_816648]) of presumed cardiac etiology.  An a rrest is presumed to be cardiac (i.e., related 
to heart disease) if this is likely, based on the available information, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816649]. The cardiac arrest will be further sub-classified into either: 
a) witnessed, occurring within  60 min from the onset of new symptoms, in the absence of a 
clear cause other than cardiovascular; or  
b) unwitnessed, within 24 hours of being observed alive, in the absence of pre-existing other 
non-cardiovascular causes of death;  
Note: Non-cardiac causes of car diac arrest, such as drug ove rdose, suicide, drowning, 
hypoxia, exsanguination, cerebrovascular accide nt, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or trauma 
must not be present. 
23.14. Definition of Resuscitated Cardiac Arrest [ADDRESS_1130913] is present when there is restoration of both: 
1.       Organized electrical activity, and 
2.       Organized mechanical activity resul ting in restoration of spontaneous circulation 
(defined as the documented pres ence of a measurable pulse and blood pressure at any time 
after initiation of resuscitative efforts).

since initiation/change and have their qualifying lipid measurements measured (TG 
and LDL -C) after the washout period (at Visit 1.1).  
 Statins may be administered with or without ezetimibe.   
NOTE: If patients qualify at the first qualification visit (Visit 1) for TG and LDL -C, and 
meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, they may be randomized at Visit 2. If patients do not qualify at the first qualifying visit (Visit 1), a second re -qualifying visit (Visit 1.1) 
is allowed. For some patients, because they need to stabilize medications and/or need to washout medications, the second re -qualifying visit (Visit 1.1) will be needed after the 
stabilization/washout period.

STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  
This is a multi- center, multi- national, prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study. 
This is an event -driven trial: It is expected that a minimum of approximately 1612 primary 
endpoint events will be required during the study. Approximately 7990 patients will be 
randomized at multiple  Research Sites worldwide over an estimated  period of approximately 
4.2 years . After randomization, patients will be treated and followed up to a n estimated

Confidential and Proprietary  
Amendment # 2: [ADDRESS_1130936] been adjudicated . 
Screening Period : 
During the screening period, patients will be evaluated for inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Patients will be eligible for randomization if they meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Prospectively, eligible patients with documented CVD or diabetes (with at least one additional ri sk factor for CVD) will undergo screening to establish suitability for inclusion in 
the trial. The qualifying lipid determination at Visit [ADDRESS_1130937] 
a fasting TG level 200 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L ) and <500 mg/dL (5.64 mmol/L ) in order to 
enter the treatment/follow -up period of the trial (and they need to meet all other 
inclusion/exclusion criteria). These patients will be randomized at Visit 2, which  will occur 
soon after Visit 1 (there will be no Visit 1.1 for these patients). 
Patients who do not qualify at Visit 1, may return to the Research Site for a second qualifying 
visit (Visit 1.1) at which time procedures that caused failure of eligibility at Visit [ADDRESS_1130938] Visit  1.1 to 
determine whether they qualify based on l ipid level requirements (TG and LDL -C) 
determined at Visit 1. Other procedures that caused failure of eligibility at Visit 1 will also be repeat ed at Visit 1.1. Details are listed in the main section of the protocol. 
Treatment/Follow -Up Period : 
At Visit 2 (Day  0), eligible patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to one of the following 
treatment groups:  
 AMR101 4 g daily, or 
 Placebo.  
Stratification will be by [CONTACT_816718] (established CVD or the presence of diabetes with 
≥1 risk factor for CVD), use  of ezetimibe and by [CONTACT_101820] (Westernized, Eastern 
European, and Asia Pacific countries). 
During the treatment/follow -up period, patients will return to the Research Site at regular 
intervals for efficacy and safety evaluations, and drug supply and compliance checks. The 
visits after the randomization visit (Visit 2; Day  0) are scheduled for 4 months after Visit 2 
(for Visit 3); 8 months aft er Visit 3 (for Visit 4); and then every year thereafter.  
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Eligible patients will be randomly assigned at Visit 2 to receive orally AMR101 4 g daily or 
matching placebo. AMR101 is provided in 1 g liquid- filled, oblong, gelatin capsules. The 
matching placebo capsule is filled with light liquid paraffin and contains 0 mg of AMR101.

Amendment # 2: 8 July 2016  Page 15 of 132 AMR101 or  matching placebo capsules are to be taken with food (i.e. with or at the end of a 
meal).  
During the treatment period, the daily dose of study drug is 4 capsules per day taken as two 
capsules taken on two occasions per day (2 capsules given twice daily).  
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
 Intent- to-treat (ITT), Modified ITT (mITT), Per Protocol (PP), and Safety  analyses  
 Parameters will be sum marized using mean, standard deviation, median, minimum , 
maximum, and interquartile range for continuous data and percentage for categorical 
data.  
 Survival analysis using the log -rank test for the primary efficacy outcome comparing 
the 2  treatment groups (AMR101 and Placebo) and including the stratification factor s 
CV risk category , use of ezetimibe and geographical region (Westernized, Eastern 
European, and Asia Pacific countries). 
 Exploratory subgroup analyses will be performed for the primary and key sec ondary 
endpoints for the ITT, mITT and PP populations , based on demographics, disease 
parameters, treatment parameters, and baseline characteristics  including lipid and 
lipoprotein parameters.  
Two interim analys es are planned, to occur  when approximately 60%  and 80%  of the 
planned total number of events have been adjudicated . 
The analys es are planned to: 
 Describe at baseline: Patient characteristics, including lipi[INVESTIGATOR_6520], stroke 
history, CV risk factors, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome, among others. 
 Compare the primary, secondary, and tertiary endpoints between treatment groups at 
the corresponding follow-up time points. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
Sample size calculation was based on assumptions of constant hazard,  asymmetric 
recruitment rate over time and without factoring for dropouts. A risk reduction corresponding 
to a hazard ratio of 0.85 (AMR101 vs. control) was assumed. A total of [ADDRESS_1130939] ratio with approximately 90% power with one -sided alpha -
level at 2.5% and with two interim analyses. The operating characteristics of this design are 
identical to those of a corresponding group sequential design with a two -sided alpha level of 
0.05. 
The recruitment period was assumed to be approximately 4.2 years with 20% recruitment in 
the first year, 40% in the second year, 20% in the third year, 19% in the fourth year and the remaining 1% in the last 0.2 years. The expected maximum study duration is estimated at 6.5 years unless t he trial is terminated early for efficacy or safety issues. A one- year event 
rate of 5.2% (hazard = 0.053) in the control arm is also assumed. Under these assumptions the number of patients to be enrolled is N = 7990. 
Since this is an events -driven trial, the ‘sample size’ is the number of events rather than the 
number of patients. The number of events that occur depends primarily on three factors: how

Amendment # 2: [ADDRESS_1130940] 1 a djudicated, primary event (and 
appropriately accounting for patients with potential primary events for which the 
adjudication process is then incomplete) was  consistent with projections, then the study could 
continue toward the protocol -specified target enrollment of 7990 patients.  However, if the 
number of such events appeared  less than, and inconsistent with projections, the Sponsor 
would consider (under blinded conditions) re -calculating the number of patients needed to 
achieve the target number of events within the desired timeline or ex tending the follow -up 
period.  If the projected increase in number of patients was ≤25% of the original 7990 target population, the Sponsor could, with documented approval of both the REDUCE -IT Steering 
Committee and the Data Monitoring Committee, extend enrollment to the revised target number without need for an additional protocol amendment. Under those conditions, all 
principal investigators, ethics committees, and regulatory authorities associated with the protocol will be promptly notified of the actio n. If the projected increase in number of 
patients was more than 25% above the original 7990 target ( i.e. more than 1998 additional 
patients) a formal protocol amendment would be initiated.  
Consistent with the plan stated above, an analysis and modeling of  pooled, blinded primary 
efficacy endpoint events across the remainder of the trial was performed prior to the projected enrollment of the 7990
th patient.  Based on this analysis, the sample size of 7990 
randomized patients is with 95% confidence likely to  result in the target 1,[ADDRESS_1130941] patient was randomized.

Amendment # 2: 8 July 2016  Page 25 of 132 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
AMR101 (marketed as Vascepa® in the [LOCATION_002] [ US]) is an ethyl ester of 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride (TG) levels 
in adult patients with severe (≥500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia  (HTG) , which received 
initial US regulatory approval in 2012. AMR101, derived from fish oil, is being developed 
by [INVESTIGATOR_816571]. (hereafter referred to as Amarin  or the Sponsor ) for the treatment of 
HTG. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether AMR101, combined with a statin 
therapy,  will be superior to the statin therapy  alone, when used as a prevention in reducing 
long- term clinical events in patients with mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816654]  
(CV) events.  
1.1. Background 
Since the initial observation of a link between fish oil consumption and the reduced incidence of coronary heart disease in the Eskimos of Greenland (Bang 1972), a large body of evidence 
has accumulated suggesting that regular intake of omega -3 fatty acids  (O3FAs)  exerts 
cardioprotective effects in both primary and secondary coronary heart disease prevention (Harris 2008, Lee 2008). Several mechanisms have been proposed to account  for these 
beneficial effects, including the reduction of TG, suppression of cardiac arrhythmias, 
decreased platelet aggregation, improved plaque composition and stabilization, and hemodynamic changes. This mounting body of evidence has led the American He art 
Association (AHA) to recommend the consumption of O3FA s in dietary fish or in capsule 
form at a dose of 1 g/day for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD)  (Kris -
Etherton 2002). This recommendation has now been included in American College  of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the long -term 
management of patients with stable angina and acute coronary syndromes (Antman 2004, Fraker 2007, Anderson 2007). 
A large number of studies have also demonstrated the TG-lower ing effects of O3FA s (Harris 
1997, Ginsberg 2001). Multiple products have been approved in the US and European Union  
(EU) consisting of approximately 85-90% of the O3FA s EPA and docosahexaenoic acid 
(DHA). These  products have generally been approved as prescription product s (up to 
4 g/day ) to lower TG in patients with TG ≥500 mg/dL w hen diet alone is insufficient 
(Omacor Summary of Product Characteristics  [SPC] , 03/2015; Lovaza ® United S tates 
Prescribing Information  [USPI] , 05/2014). Omacor
® at a dose of  1 g/da y is also approved in 
certain European and Asian markets for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction  
(MI), p ost-MI. 
Epadel capsules, which contain highly purified (>95%) ethyl -EPA, have been marketed by 
[CONTACT_816721] 1990 for the treatment of arteriosclerosis obliterans and since 1994 
for the treatment of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (Epadel SPC 10/2013). The recommended dose is 
1.8 g/day for arteriosclerosis obliterans and 1.8 to 2.7 g/day for hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  Hypertriglyceridemia is a  feature of many dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816655]/or have Type 2 diabetes mellitus in isolation or as a component of the metabolic 
syndrome (Jacobson 2007, Bays 2008).

Amendment # 2: 8 July 2016  Page 26 of 132 Elevation in TG confers dual risks of acute pancreatitis (mos t marked in patients with severe 
HTG [TG >1500 mg/dL]) (Yadav 2003) and accelerated atherosclerosis leading to CV 
events, the latter even after correction for other lipid and non-lipid risk factors (Jacobson 
2007). With this in mind, Amarin is assessing the potential of AMR101 capsules, which 
contain highly purified ethyl -EPA, as an adjunct to diet, for the treatment of patients with 
very high TG levels (≥500 mg/dL) and those at high risk for CVD with high TG levels 
(≥200 and <500 mg/dL) despi[INVESTIGATOR_816656].  Amarin -sponsored studies with 
AMR101 in patients with very high TGs (Study AMR -01-01- 0016, the MARINE study ) and 
in patients at high risk for CVD  with high TGs despi[INVESTIGATOR_749631]  (Study AMR -01-01-
0017, the ANCHOR study ) have been completed  (Bays 2011, Ballantyne 2012). 
In July 2012, Vascepa (AMR101; ethyl -EPA ; icosapent ethyl ) received initial US regulatory 
approval as an adjunct to diet to reduce TG levels in adult patients with severe (≥500 mg/dL) HTG. 
1.2. Summary of Completed Amarin -Sponsored Clinical Studies  of AMR101 in 
Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia  
As of Amendment [ADDRESS_1130951] investigated  the efficacy of AMR101 in lowering TG : 
 Study AMR -01-01- 0016 (the MARINE study) in 229 patients with very  high TG 
(≥500 and ≤2000 mg/dL ). 
 Study AMR -01-01- 0017 (the ANCHOR study) in 702 patients at high risk for 
CVD with mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (high TG: ≥200 to <500 mg/dL) on statin therapy. 
1.2.1. Study AMR -01-01- 0016 (MARINE)  
The primary objective of the MARINE Study was to determine the efficacy of AMR101 
compared to placebo in lowering fasting TG levels in patients with very high fasting TG levels (≥500 and ≤2000 mg/dL). 
A total of 229 patients were randomized (1:1:1) to 12- weeks of double -blind treatment with 
AMR101 2 g/day, AMR101 4 g/day, or pl acebo. Prior to randomization, t here was a 4 - to 
6-week diet and lifestyle stabilization period and a 2 -week TG qualifying period.  Baseline 
characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms. Overall, the mean age was 
52.9 years, mean body mass index (BMI ) was 30.8 kg /m2 and approximately 25% of  patients 
were using a statin at baseline. In the evaluation of the primary endpoint, t he MARINE results 
demonstrated significant placebo -adjusted reductions in median fasting TG levels with 
AMR101 2 g/day ( -19.7%; p=0.0051) and 4 g/day ( -33.1%; p<0.0001) after 12 weeks of 
treatment.  Placebo -adjusted changes in key lipid and inflammatory endpoints are shown i n 
Figure 1. The magnitudes of reductions in TG levels observed in MARINE are expectedly 
higher than those seen in ANCHOR, as the patients had very hig h baseline TG levels. Safety 
and tolerability results for the AMR101 groups were consistent with those seen in previous 
clinical studies in other populations and not notably different from the results in the placebo group.

1.2.2. Study AMR -01-01- 0017 (ANCHOR)  
The primary objective in the ANCHOR study  was to determine the efficacy of AMR101 2 g 
daily and 4 g daily, compared to placebo, in lowering fasting TG levels in patients with high 
risk for CV D and fasting TG levels ≥200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL, despi[INVESTIGATOR_816657] (LDL- C) goal (>40 mg/dL and <100 mg/dL).  
After a 6 - to 8- week screening period which included diet and lifestyle stabilization, a 
washout period for excluded non- statin lipid -altering medications (if needed), and a TG 
qualifying period, patients were randomized to one of 3 treatment groups and re ceived study 
medication during a 12- week, double -blind treatment period. Patients had to be treated with 
one of 3 s tatins (simvastatin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) to reach their LDL -C goal of 
<100 mg/dL (+15% allowed for variability) and had to be on a stable dose for a minimum 
period of [ADDRESS_1130952] qualifying fasting TG levels of ≥200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL based on the mean of 2 m easurements. During the 12 -week doubl e-blind treatment period, patients 
received orally AMR101 2 g/day, AMR101 4 g/day, or placebo. 
Patients were randomized to either 2 or 4 g/day of AMR101 or placebo for 12 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was the reduction in TG levels compared to placebo. Secondary endpoints 
were percent change in LDL -C compared to placebo, non- high density lipoprotein

AMR101 4g/day reduced median placebo-adjusted TG levels nonsignificantly by 13.1% 
(n=45, p=0.5467) in the lowest statin potency regimen (simvastatin 5- 10 mg/day); 
significantly by 20.1% ( n=429; p< 0.0001) in the medium potency statin regimen 
(rosuvastatin 5- 10 mg, atorvastatin 10- 20 mg, simvastatin 20- 40 mg, simvastatin 10- 20 mg + 
ezetimibe 5 -10 mg); and significantly by 26 % (n=213, p<0.0001) in the highest statin 
potency regimen (rosuvastatin 20-40 mg, atorvastatin 40 -80 mg, simvastatin 80 mg or 
simvastatin with ezetimibe 5 -10 mg). The statin potency regimens were predefined.  
Of the 702 patients with HTG enrolled in this study, 514 h ad diabetes mellitus. Efficacy 
results in patients with diabetes were similar to those of patients without diabetes , and no 
significant changes in fasting plasma glucose or HbA 1c with AMR101 vs placebo were 
observed. 
The reduction in TG observed with AMR101 was also associated with a placebo -adjusted 
decrease in median LDL -C levels at both doses. Median baseline LDL -C levels were 
82.0 mg /dL (4  g/day), 82.0 mg/dL (2 g/day), and 84.0 m g/dL (placebo).  AMR1014 g/day

1.3. Clinical Safety  
In the MARINE and ANCHOR trials, a total of [ADDRESS_1130953] been exposed to ethyl -EPA 
from AMR101 capsules. AMR101 has been well tolerated (with incidence of adverse events 
[AEs] similar to placebo) and  there have been no major safety concerns. See the 
Investigator’s Brochure for more information. 
The types (by [CONTACT_11702]) of common treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and 
their incidence in the MARINE and ANCHOR trials are listed in  Table 1.

In a large study with Japanese patients (Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study [JELIS]), long-
term administration of 1.8  g/day ethyl -EPA (Epadel®) was associated with an excellent safety 
and tolerability profile (Yokoyama 2007). Most AEs attributable  to ethyl -EPA were regarded 
as mild. The most common adverse events were gastro- intestinal (nausea, diarrhea, epi[INVESTIGATOR_258713]) or dermatologic (eruption, itching, exanthema, eczema) in nature. 
1.4. Rationale 
Hypothesis 
The hypothesis is that combination a nti-dyslip idemic therapy of an LDL- C lowering drug 
(statin  therapy ) with the TG-lowering drug AMR101 will be superior to the LDL- C lowering 
therapy alone when used as prevention in reducing long- term clinical events in patients with 
mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816658].  
Medical Need  
CVD resulting from progressive atherosclerosis remains the most common cause of 
morbidity and mortality all over the world. Based on 2009-2012 US statistics (AHA 2016), 
an estimated 85.6 million American adults (more than one in three) have one or more types 
of CVD. Of these, 43.7 million are estimated to be age 60 or older. Total CVD includes 80 
million with high blood pressure (HBP), 15.5 million with coronary heart disease ( CHD ), 
which includes  7.6 million with myocardial infarction and 8.2 million with angina pectoris , 
5.7 million with heart failure (HF)  and 6.6 million with stroke  (all types) . Mortality data 
show that CVD as the underlying cause of death accounted for 30.8% of all deaths (about 800,937 of all 2.6 million deaths in 2013). CVD is the leading global cause of death, 
accounting for >17.3 million deaths per year in 2013, a number that  is expected to grow to 
>23 million by 2030. In 2013, CVD deaths represented 31% of all global deaths. In addition

Amendment # 2: [ADDRESS_1130954] insulin resistance, Type 2 di abetes mellitus, or the metabolic syndrome (Jacobson 2007; Bays 2008) . Elevation in TG is positively associated with accelerated 
atherosclerosis leading to CV events, the latter even after correction for other lipid and non-lipid risk factors (Jacobson 2007). In the US (AHA 2016), the mean TG level for American 
adults age 20 and older is 108.8 mg/dL (men, 117.2 mg/dL; women, 101.4 mg/dL). 
Approximately 25.1% of adults had high triglyceride (TG) levels (>150 mg/dL) during 2009-2012. 
Lifestyle modification is important for the management of patients with HTG; however, for 
patients who do not  adequately respond to dietary and lifestyle restrictions, relatively few classes of drugs are available to treat HTG, and each is associated with risks that may limit 
their use alone or in combination. In addition to V ascepa, currently available 
pharmacological treatments for high and/or very TG include fibric acid derivatives (such as 
gemfibrozil and fenofibrate), niacin in various formulations, pr escription omega -3-acid ethyl 
esters (Lovaza/Omacor) and statins (3 -hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase 
inhibitors).  
Although the above agents have robust TG -lowering effects in patients with HTG, the degree 
of TG -lowering is highly variable; ge nerally greater TG -lowering effects are observed for 
each TG -lowering agent  compared with statins , particularly compared to the efficacy of 
statin doubling in patients with dy slipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] . Many patients will be satisfactorily treated with 
one or more of the above range of drugs (combined with appropriate diet and attention to 
other CV risk factors and lifestyle).  
A large number of studies have demonstrated the TG -lowering effects of O3FAs (Ballantyne 
2012; Ginsberg 2001; Harris 1997). Lovaza, comprised predom inantly of ethyl- EPA and the 
ethyl ester of DHA (ethyl -DHA) and approved at 4 g/day (equivalent to 4 capsules/day), is 
indicated only in patients with very high TG levels (≥500 mg/dL), and raises LDL- C even 
when combined with statins in patients with high (200- 499 mg/dL)  and very high 
(≥500 mg/dL) TGs .  Of the seven CVOTs  utilizing mixtures of EPA and DHA (see  Table 3 ), 
two demonstrated significant primary endpoint risk reduction, one demonstrated CV risk 
reduction only in the post hoc analysis of diabetic patients, and four did not demonstrate benefit.  
Fibrates and niacin are clearly effective at raising HDL -C and lowering TG concentrations ; 
fibrate s also raise LDL -C in patients with very high TGs (≥500 mg/dL) . However, their 
effects on vascular events remain uncertain. Several large- scale trials of fibrate therapy have 
been completed in the past few years. Although some of these trials have suggested benefit, others have shown no effect, leading to uncertainty about the presence and magnitude of any CV protective effects and difficulties for clinicians in interpretation of the results (Jun 2010). The ACCORD -Lipid study (Ginsberg 2010) reported no ove rall benefit for fenofibrate  plus 
statin therapy over statin monotherapy , although a suggestion of benefit was observed in 
subjects with dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816659] -C. Similarly , studies of niacin 
as add -on therapy to statin have not demonstrated a benefit with regard to CV outcomes in 
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Amendment # 2: 8 July 2016  Page 31 of 132 their full study populations (see AIM -HIGH and HPS2 -THRIVE  ), although benefit was 
observed in a subset of AIM -HIGH patients with high TG and low HDL -C. While such 
subgroup analyses are suggestive of benefit in certain patients with dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], the lack of 
benefit in th e primary study populations nonetheless raises further questions about the 
usefulness of these agents. 
There are also safety issues with the above agents that limit th eir clinical use. Statins, particularly at high doses, may cause increases in hepatic transaminases and are also known to cause myopathy and occasionally rhabdomyolysis, which may lead to death from acute renal failure. This risk may be increased when fibrates and statins are co -administered and 
many clinicians will avoid co -prescribing the se 2 medications. Fibrates are also associated 
with interactions with warfarin and hepatic transaminase elevations. The utility of niacin is limited by [CONTACT_816840][INVESTIGATOR_170801]-
steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs. Niacin is also associated with impairment of glucose 
tolerance and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_816660].

goal; 26% had low HDL -C levels; and 38% had elevated TG. This study demonstrates that 
persi stent dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816663] -treated patients.  
Patients with dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], particularly those with established CVD or diabetes, have therapeutic needs that cannot be met by [CONTACT_816793]. It is hypothesized that achieving target values for LDL -C/non- HDL -C in these patients using a therapeutic approach of the 
combination of AMR101 and a statin will benefit these patients. Such a combination therapy might increase the likelihood of therapeutic success in these patients with regards to future 
risk of CVD, based on meeting of both LDL -C/non- HDL -C goals and TG goals according to 
the ACC/AHA guidelines (Anderson 2007). Approximately [ADDRESS_1130956] high TG levels (≥200 mg/dL), however only a minority (3.6%) are currently treated with 
prescription medication (Ford 2009). Patients with elevated TGs are currently under -served 
and would benefit from a new, safe and effective product that can provide the following attributes: 
 Robust efficacy to lower TGs 
 Safe to use with other lipid -lowering agents, including statins  
 Does not increase LDL -C when used in patients on s tatin therapy 
(TG=200-499 mg/dL)  
 Has convenient dosing regimen 
 Has class -specific positive outcomes data  
TG-Lowering as a Therapeutic CV Target  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_904], clinical, an d recent genetic studies contribute to evidence that increased TG

further implicated loci associated with TG levels as contributing independently to coronary 
artery disease ( CAD) risk (Pollin 2008, Schunkert 2011, Jørgensen 2014, Do 2013, Do 2015, 
Dewey 2016, S titziel 2016) . In addition, l oss-of- function mutations of the gene encoding 
apolipoprotein C3 ( APOC3 ), associated with low non- fasting levels of TG, resulted in risk 
reduction of 41%  for ischemic vascular disease for heterozy gotes  compared with non- carriers 
(hazard ratio [ HR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 0.41- 0.86; p=0.007) and a risk 
reduction of 36% for ischemic heart disease (HR 0.64, 95 % CI: 0.41- 0.99; p=0.04) 
(Jørgensen 2014). Similarly, in another study, d eleterious mutations to APOC3  resulted in 
reductions of  risk of 40% (OR 0.60; 95% CI: 0.47-0.75; P=4×10-6) (The TG and HDL 
Working Group 2014)  compared with non- carriers . In yet another study of genes strongly 
associated with TG  levels (but not HDL- C), the direction of the association and its magnitude 
were both consistent with a contribution of ri sk for CAD (Do  2013). Moreover, s tudies 
centering on the metabolism of TG -rich lipoproteins have  also put these TG-rich lipoproteins 
within the causative pathway of C VD, similar to LDL -C (Wittrup 1999, Do 2015). Of note, 
the same genetic correlation between HDL -C and CVD was not found.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_816664] c linical s tudies have shown that elevated levels of total cholesterol  (TC)  
and LDL-C are associated with increased risk of CHD ( LaRosa 2003), and t herapeutic 
strategies that lead to a statistically significa nt reduction in LDL -C lower CHD event rates 
(Baigent 2005). One potential impediment  to optimal reduction in CHD events despi[INVESTIGATOR_816665]-treatment LDL -C is residual e levation in serum TG levels ( Miller 2000). Indeed, even 
after adjustment for HDL -C, detailed evaluation of population- based prospective studies has 
disclosed an independent effect of TG on C HD events (Sarwar 2007). Coupled with the 
knowledge that combined hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (i.e., elevated LDL -C and TG) promotes CHD to a 
significantly greater extent than either high LDL -C or TG alone ( Manninen 1992), the 
hypothesis is strong that low on- treatment levels of TG when added to low LDL -C would be 
superior to low LDL -C alone in reducing subsequent CHD events . Supporti ng evidence for 
this hypothesis was obtained in a post -hoc analysis of the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin 
Evaluation and Infection Therapy -Thrombolysis i n Myocardial Infarction 22 Trial (PROVE 
IT-TIMI 22 ) (Miller 2008 ) wherein among patients receiving statin therapy after acute 
coronary syndrome ( ACS ), on treatment TG  <150 mg/dL was associated with a lower risk of 
recurrent CHD events independent of the level of LDL -C. For each 10% lowering of TG 
attained during the first 30  days of treatment after an ACS event, the risk for death, MI, or 
recurrent ACS  was reduced by 2.3% ( p =0.035) after adjustment for high LDL -C 
(>70  mg/dL) and low HDL -C (<40 and 50 mg/dL in men and women, respectively). 
Several large clinical studies have examined  the effects of non-statin  lipid-modifyi ng agents 
(with TG -lowering effects) in combination with statin therapy versus statin monotherapy  on 
CV events  (see Table 2).

Amendment #2: [ADDRESS_1130958], was a randomized, double- blind study 
of fenofibrate +statin therapy  vs placebo+ statin therapy in 5518 patients with Type 2  diabetes 
mellitus  with clinical CVD, anatomical evidence of CV D, or 2 additional risk factors (in 
addition to diabetes)  for CVD (Ginsberg 2010) . The study evaluated whether the use of 
fenofibrate and simvastatin to increase plasma HDL -C and reduce TG would provide an 
additional CV benefit compared to simvastatin alone, as determined by [CONTACT_816841] a composite of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CV death . Baseline 
characteristics were similar between treatment groups . After a mean follow -up of 4.7 years, 
the annual rates of CV events were not significantly different between treatment groups  
(2.2% for fenofibrate and 2.4% for placebo; HR: 0.92, 95%  CI: 0.7 9-1.08; p=0.32) . In 
examined subgroups, there was a suggestion of heterogeneity according to baseline lipid 
levels. Although ACCORD- Lipid did not prospectively enroll patients  specifically  with high 
TG (baseline median  162 mg/dL ; interquartile range [ IQR] of 113-229 mg/dL) , and 40% of 
patients were not on statin therapy at baseline, a non- significant numerical reduction in CV 
event rate with fenofibrate was observed in patients in the highest baseline TG tertile (11.1% for fenofibrate vs 12.8% for placebo). A more compelling  trend toward benefit approached 
significance in a smaller subgroup of patients within both the highest baseline TG tertile 
(≥204 mg/dL) and lowest baseline HDL -C tertile (≤34  mg/dL) , with fenofibrate vs placebo 
(12.4% vs 17.3%; p=0.057 for interaction). Although the results of ACCORD -Lipid suggest 
an association of TG reduction with reduction in CV events  in patients with dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] , the 
facts that  approximately 65% of patients had had baseline TG <200 mg/dL , and that 40% of 
patients  were not on statin  therapy  at baseline, diminish  the ability of the study  to examine  
the effects of TG-lowering in patients with high TG levels  despi[INVESTIGATOR_816666] .  
The AIM -HIGH Study  
The AIM -HIGH Study was a randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled study of  the effects of 
extended -release niacin 1500–2000 mg/day in 3414 CVD patients receiving simvastatin on 
the primary endpoint of incidence of CV events  (first event of death from coronary heart 
disease, nonfatal MI, ischemic stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] >23 hours from ACS , or symptom -
driven coronary or cerebral revascularization) (AIM -HIGH Investigators 2011) . The study 
was stopped early  due to futility and safety concerns, which subsequently  were determined 
not to be drug -related. In this trial, extended -release (ER) niacin plus simvastatin as 
compared with simvastatin alone was associated with significant increases in HDL –C levels 
and decreases in TG levels, but there was no significant reduction in the primary composite 
endpoint of CV events over a mean follow -up period of 36 m onths  (HR=1.02, 95% 
CI=0.87- 1.21, p=0.79) . Although AIM -HIGH did not prospectively enroll patients with 
elevated TG levels ( baseline median TG for the niacin arm was 164 mg/dL; IQR=127-218 
mg/dL), when the effect of treatment on CV events by [CONTACT_816842]/lipoprotein tertiles was 
studied, for the 522 (15.3%) subjects who simultaneously had baseline TG levels in the 
highest tertile ( >198 mg/dL ) and HDL -C levels in the lowest tertile (<33 mg/dL ), a 
nonsignificant trend toward reduction of CV risk was evident in the ER niacin group (HR: 0.74, p=0.073). In a smaller subgroup (n= 439 [12.9%]) that met somewhat stricter criteria of 
TG levels >200 mg/d L and HDL -C levels <32  mg/d L, the reduc tion in events in the niacin 
group was significant (HR: 0.64, p= 0.032). Although AIM -HIGH did not prospectively seek

Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 36 of 132 to enroll statin -treated patients with persistently  high TG, and therefore was not well suited to 
studying the benefit of TG-lowering in this patient population, the results of subgroup 
analyses  are consistent with a CV benefit to TG -lowering therapy in patients with 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816667] -controlled LDL -C. 
The HPS2 -THRIVE Study  
The HPS2 -THRIVE Study was a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study of 
niacin 2000 mg/day and laropi[INVESTIGATOR_105169] 40 mg/day in addition to statin therapy vs matching 
placebo added to statin therapy in 25,673 adult patients with occlusive arterial disease at  high 
risk for CVD  (HPS2 -THRIVE Collaborative Group 2014). The primary endpoint was the 
first event of a composite of major vascular  event s (including nonfatal MI, coronary death, 
nonfatal or fatal stroke, coronary or non -coronary artery surgery or ang ioplasty [including 
amputation]). Mean follow -up was 3.9 years . The study did not demonstrate a benefit to 
niacin therapy added  to statin  vs statin alone in the full study population (HR=0.96; 95% 
CI = 0.90 -1.03, p=0.29) . An exploratory analysis of patients with high TG (≥151 mg/dL) and 
low HDL -C (<35 mg/dL)  found no significant difference between the niacin/laropi[INVESTIGATOR_816668] (15.1% vs 15.5%, respectively, of patients with an event).  Of note, a n important consideration for this analysis 
is that there were no lipid inclusion criteria in HPS2 -THRIVE and, as a result , the median 
baseline TG value was 108 mg/dL with a full interquartile range of 73 mg/dL (mean TG ± standard deviation was 125 ± 74 m g /dL), m arkedly lower than the median baseline TG 
values in ACCORD -Lipid and AIM -HIGH . In addition, the  interquartile range is reflected in 
the fact that only 26% of patients in the HPS2- THRIVE trial had TG values at or above 151 
mg/dL , and sugge sts that ve ry few subjects had  TG levels  >200 mg/dL. Accordingly, it is  
difficult to glean from HPS2 -THRIVE any conclusive information regarding the potential 
CV benefit of niacin therapy  in subjects with high TG despi[INVESTIGATOR_749631].  
The Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS)  
While no outcome study to date has specifically tested the benefit of lowering TG in a statin -
treated population with persistent HTG, JELIS has demonstrated the CV benefit of 1.8 g/day 
ethyl -EPA added to a statin in 18,645 patients with el evated cholesterol  (Yokoyama 2007) . 
JELIS was a prospective,  randomized, open- label , blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE 
design) study of ethyl -EPA 1.8 g/day added to statin therapy v ersus statin alone in Japanese 
patients  with hypercholesterolemi a. JELIS is the only completed cardiovascular outcomes 
trial (CVOT) that has looked specifically at the effects of ethyl -EPA therapy – without DHA 
or other omega -3 fatty acids – on CV risk reduction.  The mean follow -up was 4.6 years.  The 
primary endpoint was  the occurrence of major coronary events, including sudden cardiac 
death, fatal and non -fatal MI, unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, stenting, and coronary 
artery by[CONTACT_15806]. JELIS demonstrated  a 19% relative reduction in the risk of major 
coronar y events (primary endpoint)  in the ethyl -EPA plus statin  group vs statin alone group 
(HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.69 to 0.95) . In addition to the significant primary outcome, and as 
performed in the ACCORD -Lipid, AIM -HIGH, and HPS2- THRIVE trials, the JELIS 
inves tigators conducted a sub- analysis of primary prevention patients with abnormal lipid 
levels,  defined as baseline (statin -naïve) TG ≥150 mg/dL and HDL -C <40 mg/dL. Compared 
to patients with normal baseline serum TG and HDL -C levels, those with abnormal leve ls

Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 37 of 132 had a significantly higher risk of CAD, and ethyl -EPA treatment suppressed  the risk of 
primary events  by 53% (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23-0.98; p=0.043). 
As the only  major published CVOT administering ethyl -EPA -only co- therapy with statin, 
JELIS is most similar in design to the current REDUCE -IT study.  Therefore, it is worthwhile 
to note some details of JELIS design and the resulting data that differ from REDUCE -IT. 
First, the baseline TG levels in JELIS were fairly low (153 -154 mg/dL). Also of note,  JELI S 
was conducted exclusively in Japanese patients, and  the Japanese population is generally 
found to have lower CV risk rates and higher baseline EPA levels in comparison to Western 
populations ; the latter , which is believed to be due to higher dietary inta ke. Baseline plasma 
EPA levels were high  in JELIS, and yet despi[INVESTIGATOR_816669], along 
with the dose and duration of treatment between JELIS (1.8 g/day in a Japanese population 
for a median follow -up of 4.6 years) and the ANCHOR study (4 g/day in a more diverse and 
Westernized population for 12 w eeks), the final plasma EPA levels were similar between 
these studies. In addition, there are other aspects of the JELIS study that might limit its  
applicability to broader patient populations. The majority (69%) of patients enrolled in JELIS 
were women. Furthermore , treatment in JELIS was open -label (although endpoint 
adjudication was blinded), which could influence patient and physician behavior and reporting of symptoms, decisions regarding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and referral of events for adjudication. This may be particularly relevant since the number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816670] a primary contributor to the overall positive result, and is considered a 
softer endpoint than fatal  CV events. Finally, at baseline, statin -naïve patients had a high 
LDL- C and a d ose of statins was administered  that would be considered low in a more 
Westernized patient population, potentially limiting the generalizability of the JELIS study 
results to a broader, more aggressively -treated population. Therefore, overall it is unknown 
whether the positive treatment effects observed in JELIS would have persisted if patients had been more optimally treated with statins using contemporary LDL -C targets in the United 
States. Nonetheless, 80% of JELIS patients were primary prevention and the mean baseline LDL- C of 182 mg/dL was reduced by 25% with statin therapy,  to approximately 136 mg/dL.  
For primary prevention Japanese patients at low risk for CAD  death, an LD L-C <160 mg/dL 
would meet LDL -C treatment goals according to the Japanese Atherosclerosis Society (JAS) 
guidelines, and an LDL -C <140 mg/dL would meet treatment goals for primary prevention 
Japanese patients at moderate risk (Teramoto  2013).  Therefore, whi le some higher risk JELIS 
subjects may not have been treated as aggressively as guidelines for a [LOCATION_002] -based 
population would recommend, the mean LDL -C data and the patient distribution from JELIS 
would suggest that many of the low -to-moderate risk  primary prevention subjects were 
treated to Japanese guidelines.  
Over all, in the JELIS study , ethyl -EPA  therapy added to statin therapy resulted in a coronary 
benefit beyond statin monotherapy in both the full cohort of patients with relatively normal TG levels ( -19% ; p=0.011) and a more dramatic benefit within a subgroup of higher risk 
patients with dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] ( -53%; p=0.043). In contrast, there was a suggestion of  CV 
benefit from fenofibrate or niacin co -therapy with statin  only in subjects with dyslip idemia 
within ACCORD- Lipid  (-31%; p=0.057)  and AIM -HIGH  (-36%; p=0.032). Taken together, 
these studies suggest that there may be a CV benefit to TG -lowering  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816671] -controlled LDL -C (sub -group analyses), and that ethyl -EPA 
therapy may have additional unique CV benefits  beyond treatment of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]  (JELIS 
full cohort).

patients with ACS. The study found reductions in LDL -C, along with  TG and other lipid 
changes , corresponding to reduced incidence of a composite primary endpoint of CV events 
(median follow -up of 6 years). The reduction in the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, 
unstable angina requiring rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], coronary revascularization (≥30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke suggests that CV benefit can be derived from add-on therapy to statin.  
In contrast to the CV benefit of ezetimibe co -therapy with statin observed in IMPROVE -IT, 
many studies have co -administered therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816673], despi[INVESTIGATOR_816674] -C (Table 2). 
Importantly, these studies did not prospectively enroll subjects at risk due to high TG levels

Omega -3 Fatty Acids in Fish Oils  
There is a growing body of evidence, encompassing molecular, cellular, animal and human studies defining the roles for O3FAs as bioactive agents for reducing the risks of and treating CVD (Torrejon 2007). Many epi[INVESTIGATOR_816676] , and more specifically between the intake and blood levels 
of O3FAs and CV death . For example, when comparing blood levels of O3FAs among men 
who had died of sudden cardiac death with controls matched for age and smoking status, it was found that participants with the highest blood levels of EPA and DHA had a 90% risk reduction for sudden cardiac death compared with those with the lowest levels (Albert 2002). 
Clinical trials and experimental studies, suggest important antiatherogenic and antithrombotic 
effects of O3FAs. These result from wide -ranging biological effects, including benefits on 
lipoprotein metabolism, blood pressure, endothelial function and vascular reactivity, inflammation, platelet and fibrin olytic function, cytokine production, coagulation and 
oxidative stress (Mori and Woodman 2006). Evidence suggests that increased consumption of O3FAs from fish or fish -oil supplements reduces the rates of all -cause mortality, cardiac 
and sudden death, and possibly stroke (Wang 2006). The effect was evident in both primary -
prevention (general population without a history of CVD) and secondary -prevention (patients 
with a history of CVD) studies with a stronger effect in secondary prevention. 
The Diet and Rein farction Trial (DART) was one of the first randomized, controlled studies 
to demonstrate the beneficial effects of O3FAs in secondary prevention of CHD and reported 
a 29% reduction in all -cause mortality over a 2 -year period in 2033 male MI survivors 
advis ed to increase their intake of oily fish (200 to 400 g of fatty fish per week, which 
provided 500 to 800 mg/day of O3FAs) (Burr 1989). While not statistically significant, there was also a trend toward a reduction in recurrent ischemic heart disease events  with increased 
fatty fish consumption. A post hoc analysis of patients receiving fish oil capsules (900 mg/day of EPA+DHA) in DART suggested that the protective effect was attributable to 
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 39 of 132 O3FAs (Burr 1994). The greatest benefit was seen in fatal MIs, and this observation led to 
the hypothesis that O3FAs might protect the myocardium against the adverse sequela of acute ischemic stress.  
A cardioprotective effect for O3FAs derived from fish oil is also supported by [CONTACT_816843], especially amongst high -risk individuals (Mori and Woodman 2006). 
Early separation of survival curves in the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell’Infarto Miocardic o (GISSI) -Prevenzione study (GISSI -Prevenzione Investigators 1999; 
discussed below) and the DART trial support a reduction in ventricular fibrillation and a decreased incidence of myocardial infarction (Leaf 1996) as primary mechanisms through which O3FAs prevent CVD (Mori and Woodman 2006). 
Many international bodies including the AHA, ACC, and the European Society of Cardiology have found the overall evidence for benefit sufficiently strong to make public recommendations for increased O3FA intake for both primary and secondary prevention 
(Harris 2007). 
Omega -[ADDRESS_1130961] CV primary and secondary prevention outcomes trials utilizing OM3FA focused on 
mixtures predominantly comprised of EPA+DHA, while one focused on EPA alone.  The 
largest pr ospective, randomized, controlled trial to test the efficacy of O3FAs for secondary 
prevention of CHD is the GISSI study (GISSI -Prevenzione Investigators 1999). In this study, 
11,324 patients with preexisting CHD (experienced an MI and were receiving conve ntional 
cardiac pharmacotherapy) were randomized to either 300  mg of vitamin E, 850 mg of O3FA 
ethyl esters (as EPA and DHA), both, or neither. After 3.5 years of follow -up, the group 
given the O3FAs alone experienced a 15% reduction in the primary endpoint of death, 
nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke (p <0.02). There was a 20% reduction in all -cause mortality 
(p =0.01) and a 45% reduction in sudden death (p <0.001) compared with the control group; 
vitamin E provided no additional benefit. TG decreased by 4% and LDL cholesterol levels 
increased by 2.5% after six months in the O3FA treatment groups compared with controls. This trial, although very large and carried out in a relatively "usual -care" setting, was not 
placebo controlled, dropout rates were high (>2 5%), and statin use was not required. A 
follow- up study (Marchioli 2002) assessed the time -course of the benefit of O3FAs on 
mortality in subjects in the GISSI -P Study and found that survival curves diverged early after 
randomization. Total mortality was s ignificantly lowered by 28% after 3  months of treatment 
(RR =0.59), and by 4 months, the risk of sudden cardiac death was reduced by 45% 
(RR =0.47). 
Since the completion of GISSI, several primary and secondary prevention studies failed to find a CV benefit  to OM3FA therapy, especially beyond statin monotherapy. High -level 
tabulated summaries of eight major CV outcomes trials testing omega acid mixtures or ethyl -
EPA alone are presented in  Table [ADDRESS_1130962] hoc analysis of diabetic patients, and four did not demonstrate benefit. All seven of  these trials had design limitations, but key consistent limitations were 
low OM3FA  dosing (containing 376-850 mg/day EPA+DHA), possible underutilization of

that reported baseline LDL -C, median levels were relatively low (95 -137 mg/dL). Median 
baseline TG were also relatively low across the studies (106 -185 mg/dL), with all seven 
studies being below 200 mg/dL. These patients therefore do not necessarily represe nt patients 
presenting with persistent HTG despi[INVESTIGATOR_816677] -C being treated to goal , nor did they test the CV 
benefit of higher dose OM3FA therapy. 
Ethyl -EPA  
While no outcome study to date has specifically tested the benefit of lowering TG with 
ethyl -EPA in a s tatin-treated population with persistent HTG, JELIS has demonstrated the 
CV benefit of 1.8 g/day ethyl -EPA added to a statin in 18,645 pa tients with elevated 
cholesterol  (Table 3).  As discussed above, JELIS exhibited  a 19% relative reduction in the 
risk of major coronary events (primary endpoint) in the EPA plus statin group vs statin alone group (HR  = 0.81, 95% CI=0.69 to 0.95) (see  Section 1.4, The Japan EPA Lipid Intervention 
Study ). There is evidence supporting a benefit in both primary and secondary  prevention, as 
there was  a nonsignificant 18% decrease in CV events in the 80% of patients in the JELIS 
trial without documented CAD (p  =0.13); with this effect size being essentially the same as 
that observed in the secondary prevention cohort (19%, p <0.05) (Lee 2008). 
Unlike the other OM3FA studies presented in Table 3 that administered an EPA+DHA 
mixture , the JELIS trial established the saf ety and efficacy of combination therapy with 
ethyl -EPA and a statin v ersus statin therapy alone for improving CV prognosis. The JELIS 
trial was conducted with Epadel that contains the same active ingredient, ethyl -EPA, as 
AMR101. Ethyl -EPA was shown in the JELIS study to reduce CAD events even in a 
Japanese population with very high intakes of O3FAs due to the high fish consumption.

by [CONTACT_816844].al. (Mozaffarian 2011, Mozaffarian 2012)  and Borow et. al (Borow 2015) . 
These mechanisms include changes in lipid profiles (Harris 2008), lipid uptake into the 
arterial wall (Chang 2010), plaque stabilization (Thies 2003, Cawood 2010, Yamano  2015), 
endothelial function (Geleijnse 2002, M ozaffarian 2005, W ang 2012, Yamakawa 2012), vascular function (Sasaki 2012), arterial stiffness (Pase 2011), vasodilation (Tagawa 1999), carotid intima -media thickness (Mita 2007), platelet aggregation ( Nomura 2009, Needleman  
1979), heart rate and blood pressure (Morris 1993, Mori 2010), HF (Djousse 2012, Gissi -HF 
Investigators 2008, Yamagishi 2008), oxidative stress (Mori 2003), and anti -inflammatory 
properties (systemic and endothelial) ( Cawood 2010, Calder 2010, Aaresetoey 2012, Serhan 
2008 , Wall 2010, DeCaterina 1994, Caughey 1996, Jinno 2011). Of note, EPA+DHA have been proposed to benefit arrhythmic properties (Leaf 2005, Mozaffarian 2004, Gillet 2011, Anand 2008), which has been supported by [INVESTIGATOR_136] l east one meta- analysis (Costanzo 2013), but 
not by [CONTACT_2312] (Khoueiry 2013, Cao 2012, A rmaganijan 2011), and may depend on t he specific patient populations being studied.  
The vast majority of studies addressing the effects of omega acids on CV risk have studied 
mixtures of omega acids comprised primarily of EPA+DHA. The scientific literature also 
indicates that other omega fatty acids derived from fish oil have biological effects. For instance, the manufacturer of Lovaza, an FDA approved complex mixture of omega acids comprised primarily of EPA and DHA, noted that “experimental evidence suggests that the individual omega -3 fatty acids EPA, DHA, DPA, SDA, HPA, and ALA are each either 
biologically active or are metabolized in the body to form biologically activ e agents” ( Citizen 
Petition 2009). How different omega acid components work together to produce clinical effects observed in patients is not completely understood. No studies have been conducted to elucidate the relative contribution of individual omega ac id constituents within a mixture or 
any combination of various mixed constituents. Nonetheless, potential differential effects have been reviewed by [CONTACT_816845] (Mozaffarian 2012) and distinctions in the 
effects of EPA and DHA on biologic pathways h ave been suggested.  
Dose Selection  
The dose regimen  of AMR101 in this study is  4 g/day  (4 capsules/day).  
The effects of combination treatment with ethyl -EPA  plus statins on clinical CV events  has 
been studied previously in JELIS (Yokoyama 2007) , wherein ethyl -EPA combined with low -
dose pravastatin  or simvastatin compared with statin therapy alone reduced major coronary 
events without altering rates of sudden cardiac death. These effects were achieved without any significant changes in total, LDL - or HDL -C and a statistically significant (p <0.0001), 
but relatively small (5%)  decrease in TG, suggesting that EPA  can lower CVD risk by 
[CONTACT_181001] s other than lipid lowering  (Yokoyama 2007) . In a sub-analysis of this study, the 
addition of ethyl -EPA  to pravastatin or simvastatin also reduced the incidence of CHD events 
in high- risk patients with metabolic syndrome and atherogenic dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816681] -C (Saito 2008). The JELIS study was performed in a large patient

Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 44 of 132 population w herein an ethyl -EPA dose of 1.8 g/day  translated to significant benefits on CV 
events  beyond statin monotherapy. 
In the ANCHOR study  (Amarin -sponsored) , both the 2 a nd 4 g/day dosing regimens of 
AMR101 resulted in statistically significant reductions of TGs (see Section 1.2.2). However, 
the 4  g/day dose caused a larger reduction in TG and other lipid, lipoprotein and 
inflammatory markers . In addition, the JELIS study was conducted in an exclusively 
Japanese patient population with higher baseline plasma EPA levels than most patients that 
live in more Westernized cou ntries, likely due to differences in diet and fish intake.  
Nonetheless, 12- week dosing of 4 g/day ethyl -EPA in the ANCHOR study in a Westernized  
patient population resulted in similar final plasma EPA levels as approximately 4.6 -year 
dosing of 1.8 g/day e thyl-EPA in JELIS.  Based on these changes in lipid and inflammatory 
parameters, and the resulting final plasma levels , the AMR101 4 g/day dose was selected for 
the present study. 
1.5. Risk/Benefit  
Across all completed Amarin -sponsored studies, the proportion of patients (based on the 
safety population from the randomized, double -blind periods of the studies) experiencing any 
adverse events was similar for patients on pl acebo (light paraffin oil) and patients on 
AMR101 (57.1% and 57.4% for placebo and AMR101, respectively). The proportion of patients experiencing a serious adverse event (SAE) was also similar for both treatment groups (5.2% and 6.0% for placebo and AMR101, respectively). The safety profile in the open- label extensions was similar to that observed  in the double -blind treatment periods. 
There were no SAEs attributed to AMR101 during the open- label extension periods of the 
studies. 
In summary, AMR101 is very well tolerated at daily doses up t o [ADDRESS_1130964] demonstrated that it is 
safe. See the Investigator’s Brochure for more information.

3.1. Type of Study  
Phase 3b, multi-c enter, multinational, prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study 
3.2. Study Population  
The population for this study is men and women ≥45 years of age  with established CVD, or 
men and women ≥[ADDRESS_1130967] atherogenic dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_816589] ( but at treatment goal for LDL -C, by [CONTACT_27180] a 
statin) and HTG. More details are listed in the inclusion criteria.  
The patient s will need to provide cons ent to participate in the study  and be willing and able 
to comply with the protocol and the study procedures. 3.3. Study Periods  
This study consists of the following study periods: 
 Screening Period : During the screening period, patients will be evaluated f or 
inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
At the first visit to the Research Unit (Visit 1) , study procedures will be performed for 
evaluation of patient ’s eligibility in the study. At this screening visit, patient s will sign an 
informed consent form before any study procedure is performed; the informed consent 
form will cover the treatment/follow -up period. Based on the evaluation from Visit  1, the 
following situations may occur: 
o Patients who are eligible for participation based on the study procedure s on Visit  1 
will return to the Research Unit for Visit 2 (randomization visit) to start the 
treatment/follow- up period. This case includes, for example, patients at Visit 1who 
are on a stable dose of a statin, are planning to stay on the same statin and the same 
dose of the statin, and who not need to wash out any  non- statin lipid -altering 
medi cations. 
o Patients who are not eligible for participation based on the study procedures on 
Visit 1 and are  unlike ly to become eligible in the nex t 28 da ys (for example: 
unlikely to stabilize statin dose, unable to wash out non- statin lipid -altering 
medications, etc.): these patients will be screen failed after Visit  1. 
o Patients not eligible for participation in the s tudy based on the study procedure s on 
Visit 1 may possibly become eligible in the next 28 days: these patients may return 
at the discretion of the investigator for a second optional screening visit (Visit 1.1) at which time the procedures needed for re -evaluation of the previously failed 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be repeated.  This case includes, for example,  
patients who are started on a statin  at Visit 1, whose statin dose is changed at Visit 1, 
and/or needed to wash out non- statin lipid -altering medications . The following 
applies for these patients:  
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 49 of 132  Patients with a change in the s tatin or statin dose on Visit [ADDRESS_1130968] 28  days before the lipid qualifying measurements at 
Visit 1.1. Other  concomitant medications (anti diabetic therapy, for example) can 
be optimized or stabilized during this period. 
 Patients  starting a washout at Visit [ADDRESS_1130969] 
28 days  (only 7 days for bile acid sequestrants)  before the lipid qualifying 
measurements at Visit 1.1. 
 Patients at Visit 1 who are on a stable dose of a statin, are planning to stay on the 
same statin at the same dose, and who do not need any medication washout , but 
were asked to return for Visit 1.1 to repeat one or more of the other study 
procedures not related to concomitant medications  
o Patients who become eligible for participation based on the additiona l study 
procedures at Visit  1.1 will return to the Research Unit for Visit 2 (randomization 
visit) to start the treatment/follow -up period. 
At the end of the screening period, p atients will need to meet  all inclusion/exclusion criteria 
before they can be randomized. Patients who are not eligible for participation after the 
screening period (based on study procedures at Visit 1 and/or Visit 1.1) ma y return at a later 
date for rescreening. These patients will need to re- start with all procedures starting with 
Visit 1. This includes patients who need more time to stabilize one or more conditions or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (for example: statin, antidiabetic , antihypertensive, thyroid hormone, HIV -protease 
inhibitor therapy). 
 Treatment /Follow- Up Period : Within  [ADDRESS_1130970] screening visit  (Visit 1)  or 
within [ADDRESS_1130971] screening visit (Visit 1) for those patients that have a second 
screening visit  (Visit 1.1), eligible patient s will enter the treatment /follow-up period. 
During this period, the patient s will receive study drug  during the planned visits  at the 
Research Site and take the study drug while away from the Research Site. 
During the visits, study procedures will be performed for evaluation of efficacy and safety.  A 
detailed schedule of procedures is provided in Appendix A.  
3.4. Study Duration  
Patients will be randomized at different times during the enrollment period but will all end 
the study at approximately  the same date (study end date)  and, therefore, the duration of 
follow- up will differ based on da te of randomization. It is planned that all randomized 
patients will receive study medication  and be followed-up until the study end date.   It is 
expected that a minimum of approximately [ADDRESS_1130972] been 
adjudicated.  
3.5. Study Groups  
At Visit 2 ( Day 0), eligible study patient s will be randomly assigned  to the following 
treatment groups:

This is an event -driven trial: It is expected that a minimum of approximately 1612 primary 
endpoint events will be required during the study.  A total of  approximately  7990 patient s will 
be entered into the study  to either receive AMR101 or placebo ( approximately 3995 patients 
per treatment group)  in order to observe an estimated 1612 events that make up the primary 
composite endpoint  for efficacy . Additional patients may be enrolled beyond the projected 
7990 if the number of events contributing to the primary endpoint appears less than, and 
inconsistent with , projections (see Section 12.3).   
3.7. Number of Study Sites  
Participants will be enrolled at multiple Research Sites  in multiple countries.  
3.8. Randomization 
On Day 0, eligible p atients will be randomized  to one of 2 study groups using a computer-
generated randomization schema . Randomized treatment assignment to either AMR101 or 
placebo in a 1:1 ratio will be provided using the internet ( via the Interactive Web R esponse 
System [IWRS] ). 
3.9. Blinding  
This is a double -blind study. Patients, investigators, pharmacists  and other supporting staff at 
the Research Sites , personnel and designees  of the Sponsor, study administrators and 
personnel at the organization(s) and vendors supporting the study will be unaware of the 
randomization code  (i.e., they will not know which study participants are receiving the 
experimental drug and which are receiving the placebo drug) . The study medication  
AMR 101 and  placebo capsules  will be similar in size  and appearance to maintain blinding. 
During the double -blind treatment/follow -up period, everyone ( patients, investigators, 
pharmacists and other supporting staff at the Research Sites, personnel and designees of the 
Sponsor, study administrators and personnel at the organization(s) and vendors managing/ supporti ng the study ), with the exception of the laboratory personnel performing 
the analysis , will be blinded to individual results of the efficacy laboratory measurement s 
(including lipid values). Individual results from the lipid profile may be unblinded in the 
event of an emergency for a patient.  
3.10. Stratification  
Participants will be assigned to treatment  groups stratified by [CONTACT_816846] , use of 
ezetimibe and by [CONTACT_101820] (Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific countries) . There are two CV risk categories:  
 CV Risk Category  1: patients with established CVD defined in the inclusion criteria. 
Patients with  diabetes and established CVD are included in this categ ory. 
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 51 of 132  CV Risk Category  2: patients with diabetes and at least one addition al risk factor for 
CVD, but no established CVD. 
Stratification will be recorded in the IWR S at the time of enrollment. Approximately 70% of 
the planned 7990 randomized patients will be in the CV Risk Category  1 and approximately 
30% of randomized patients  will be in the CV Risk Category  2. Enrollment with patients of a 
CV risk category will be stopped when the planned number of patients in that risk category i s 
reached.  If total study enrollment exceeds 7990 patients, inclusion of new patients will be 
limited to CV Risk Category  1.

4.1. Inclusion Criteria  
Patient s meeting the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the study:  
1. Fasting TG levels of ≥200 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L ) and <500 mg/dL  (5.64 mmol/L) . 
2. LDL-C >40 mg/dL (1.0 4 mmol/L) and ≤100 mg/dL (2.60 mmol/L) and on stable 
therapy with a statin (with or without ezetimibe) for at least 4 weeks prior to the LDL -
C/TG baseline qualifying measurements for randomization  
 Stable therapy is defined as the same daily dose of the same statin for at least  
28 days before the lipid qualification measurements ( TG and LDL -C) and, if 
applicable, the same daily dose of ezetimibe for at least  28 days before the lipid 
qualification measurements (TG and LDL -C). Patients who have their statin therapy 
or use of ezetimibe initiated at Visit 1, or have their statin, statin dose and/or 
ezetimibe dose changed at Visit  1, will need to go through a stabilization period of at 
least 28  days since initiation/change and have their qualifying lipid measurements 
measured (TG and LDL -C) after the washout period (at Visit 1.1).  
 Statins may be administered with or with out ezetimibe .  
NOTE: If patients qualify at the first qualification visit (Visit 1) for TG and LDL -C, and 
meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, they may be randomized at Visit 2. If patients don’t qualify at the first qualifying visit (Visit 1), a second re -qualifying visit (Visit 1.1) 
is allowed. For some patients, because they need to stabilize medications and/or need to washout medications, the second re -qualifying visit (Visit 1.1) will be needed after the 
stabilization/washout period. 
3. Either having established CVD (in CV Risk Category  1) or at high risk for CVD (in CV 
Risk Category  2). The CV risk categories are defined as follows:

the Research Site to assess for any endpoints or events identified. 
 Adverse events  
 Concomitant medications  
 Current address and contact [CONTACT_3031] (update if changed  or will be changing)  
Patient s will be reminded about the following items: 
 To take the study medication according to the dosing schedule assigned, with food 
 When to return to the Research Center for the next visit 
 To bring the unused study medication to the next visit  
 To not take study drug on the morning of their next visit 
 To fast for at least [ADDRESS_1130990] 10 hours. For the purposes of this study, fasting is defined 
as nothing by [CONTACT_24340] (and any essential medications).  
The investigator must review and sign all laboratory test reports. At screening, patient s who 
have laboratory values that are outside the exclusionary limits specified in the exclusion 
criteria may not be enrolled in the study. After randomization, the investigator will be notified if laboratory values are outside of their normal range. In this case, the investigator will be required to conduct clinically appropriate follow-up procedures. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Laboratory Tests 
The safety laboratory tests include:  
 Hematology with complete blood c ount (CBC), including RBC, hemoglobin ( Hgb), 
hematocrit ( Hct), white cell blood count (WBC), white cell differential , and platelet 
count 
 Biochemistry panel including total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), total 
bilirubin, glucose, calcium, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), blood urea nitrogen (BU N), serum creatinine, uric acid, creatine kinase, and HbA
1c. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Fasting Lipid Profile  
The fasting lipid panel includes: TG, TC , LDL- C, HDL -C, non- HDL -C, and VLDL -C.  
At all visits, LDL -C will be calculated using the Friedewald equation  if TG <400 mg/dL . At 
Visit [ADDRESS_1130991] LDL -C will be used if at the same visit TG >400 mg/dL 
(4.52 mmol/L).  These LDL -C values will be used for the evaluation of the LDL -C inclusion

be measured by [CONTACT_816850] -C or by [CONTACT_816851] U ltracentrifugation if at the same visit TG 
>400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L) . In addition, irrespective of the TG levels, at Visit 2 (0 Months 
of Follow -up, baseline) and at Visit 4 (12 Months of Follow -up), LDL- C direct and LDL- C 
Preparative U ltracentrifugation  will be taken . These Preparative U ltracentrifugation LDL- C 
measurements will be used in the statistical analysis including the calculation of the percent 
change from baseline (1 year versus baseline).  Hopkins LDL -C (Martin 2013)  will be 
calculated for each visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Genetic testing  
A fasting blood sample will be stored for future genetic testing at the discretion of the  
sponsor. The specifics of this test will be determined at a later date. This sample is optional 
as local regulations may prohibit genetic samples to be collected or shipped outside the 
country, or patients may not consent. 
Research on genetic testing will  look for links between genes and certain diseases, including 
their treatment(s) such as medicines and medical care.  The blood samples will be collected in 
the study center with the regular protocol -required labs. Each patient tube with sample for 
genetic testing will be labeled with patient number only. The site will maintain a Subject 
Code Identification List for cross -reference.  The patient number does not contain any 
identifiable information (i.e. Patient initials, date of birth, etc .). Un -analyzed samp les will be 
stored frozen by [CONTACT_127026] a period of up to 2 years following the end of the study, at 
which time they will be destroyed. If samples are tested, results will not be reported to the patient, parents, relatives, or attending physician and will not be recorded in the patient’s medical records. There will be no follow -up contact [CONTACT_816852]. The subject can withdraw their consent for genetic testing at any time up to analysis, even after the sample has been obtained.  The subject can notify the site in writing that they 
withdraw their consent for the genetic testing portion of the study, and it will be documented by [CONTACT_816799], as well as captured in the CRF.  The lab will be notified to pu ll 
the sample and destroy it.  
Potential genetic bioassays may be performed and may be as broad as a genome -wide 
association study (GWAS) or as limited as a single gene -target approach; potential target 
genes include, but are not limited to  the genes encod ing: Apo C3, Apo A5, CETP, LPL, 
PCSK9, TNFα, TNFβ, ALOX5, COX2, FABP genes, haptoglobin 1 and haptoglobin 2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biomarkers Assays 
The biomarker assays include: hs- CRP , Apo B and hsTnT. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Additional laboratory tests 
Additional laboratory tests include: 
 A urine pregnancy test will be administered to women of childbearing potential at 
certain visits as listed in schedule of procedures ( Appendix A ). The urine pregnancy 
tests will be performed at the Research Site utilizing marketed test kits, or at a 
certif ied clinical laboratory.  
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 66 of 132  A fasting blood sample  (10 mL) for serum archiving. This sample will be collected 
only at sites in countries where allowed by [CONTACT_816853]. The serum  from the archiving sample will be stored 
frozen  in 2 separate equal aliquots,  and will be used at the Sponsor’s discretion to 
perform repeat analyses described in the protocol or to perform other tests related to 
CV health.  
o Potential non- genetic bioassays  may be performed, including but not limited to:  
Apo A1, Apo C3, Apo E, NM R lipid profile (particle size and number), oxidized 
LDL, Lp(a), Lp -PLA 2, serum fatty -acids concentrations, and gamma -
glutamyltransferase (GGT).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blinding of Laboratory Results 
All ef ficacy laboratory results during the double -blind period of the trial will be blinded  
(values not provided)  to patients, investigators, pharmacists and other supporting staff at the 
Research Sites, personnel and designees of the Sponsor, study administrators and personnel at the organization(s) and vendors managing and/or supporting the study, with the exception of the laboratory personnel conducting the assays. To ensure patient safety, hsTnT values 
will be reported  to the site . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Flagging of Critical Lab Values 
Critical lab values are values that may warrant medical intervention to avoid possible harm to a patient. Critical lab values will be defined  in the Laboratory Manual for the study, and the 
Research Site will be not ified of the occurrence of a critical lab value ( critical high or critical 
low) by a special annotation (flag) in the laboratory reports provided t o the Research Sites . 
Although laboratory values that are part of the efficacy endpoints during the double -blind 
period of the study will not be provided to the Research Site (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the sites  
will be notified when the TG value  of a patient sample  is >1000 mg/dL  (11.29 mmol/L)  
(critical high TG value)  or if the LDL -C values of a patient sample is >130 mg/dL  
(3.37 mmol/L)  (critical high LDL-C value) . These critical high value s will need to be 
confirmed by a repeat measurement ( new fasting blood sample) within 7 days. TG value of 
>2000 mg/dL (22.58 mmol/L)  will also be flagged, so that appropriate medical action can be 
taken by [CONTACT_82674]. 
If TG values are confirmed  critically high, patients may be discontinued from study drug 
with the option to remain on study  (see Section  11.1).  The investigator should use the best 
clinical judgment for each patient which could include the use of approved TG -lowering 
medications after patients have been discontinued from study drug. 
If LDL -C values are confirmed critically high, the investigator may need to take appropriate 
medical action which could include: reinforce/intensify therapeutic lifestyle changes 
(including diet and physical activity),  increase the dose of the present statin therapy , add 
ezetimibe , or prescribe a more potent statin to lower  LDL- C. The investigator should use the 
best clinical judgment for each patient .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Medical , Surgical and Family History  
Medical history, including family history and details regarding all illnesses and allergies, 
date(s) of onset, status of current condition, and smoking and alcohol use will be collected on all patient s. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Demographics 
Demographic information including day, month, and year of birth, race, and gender will be collected for all patient s. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs  
Vital signs include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body 
temperature. Blood pressure will be measured using a standardized process: 
 Patient  should sit for 5 minutes with feet flat on the floor and measurement arm 
supported so that the midpoint of the manometer cuff is at heart level.  
 Use a mercury sphygmomanometer or automatic blood pressure device with an appropriately sized cuff with the bladder centered over the brachial artery.  
Blood pressure should be recorded to the nearest [ADDRESS_1130992] whole number on an automatic device.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physical Examination 
A physical examination must include source documentation of general appearance, skin, and 
specific head and neck, heart, lung, abdomen, extremities, and neuromuscular assessments.  [IP_ADDRESS]. Height, Weight and Body Mass Index  
Height  and weight will be measured. Measurement of weight should be performed with the 
patient  dressed in indoor clothing, with shoes removed, and bladder empty.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Waist Circumference  
Waist circumference will be measured with a tape measure, as follows: Start at the  top of the 
hip bone then bring the tape measure all the way around – level with the navel. Make sure the 
tape measure is snug, but without compressing the skin, and that it is parallel with the floor.  
Patients should not hold their breath while measuring waist circumference.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. 12-Lead ECG  
ECGs (standard 12- lead) will be obtained annually . Site personnel should make every 
attempt to perform a patient ’s ECG using the same equipment at each visit.  ECGs will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_816854] M I. Silent MIs will be sent for event 
adjudication. All post -randomization ECGs (protocol -specified and other) are to be sent to 
the CEC for evaluation of silent MI.

7.1. Treatment  
7.1.1. Treatment Regimen, Dosage, and Duration 
Eligible study  patient s will be randomly assigned on Day  0 to one of the 2 treatment groups. 
Patient s in each group will receive either 4  g/day AMR101 or placebo as in  Table 4 for up to 
approximately 6.5 years, depending on individual date of randomization and overall study 
stop date (see Section  3.4). 
The daily dose of study drug is 4 capsules per day taken as two capsules taken on t wo 
occasions per day (2 capsules giv en twice daily).  
Table 4.  Dosing Schedule during the Treatment Period  
Treatment  
Group  Daily  
Dose  Number of Capsules per Day 
1 4 g 4 capsules of 1 g AMR101 
2 Placebo  4 capsules of matching placebo 
Patients will be instructed to take study drug with food (i.e., with or at the end of their 
morning and evening meals). On days that patients are scheduled for study visits, the daily dose of study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_816855]. For the purposes of this study, fasting is 
defined as nothing by [CONTACT_24340] (and any essential medications) for at least 10 hours. 
7.1.2. Treatment Assignment  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Identification number  
A unique patient  identification number  (patient  number) will be established  for each patient  
at each site. The patient  number will be used to identify the patient  throughout the study and 
will be entered on all documentation. If a patient  is not eligible to receive treatment, or if a 
patient  discontinues from the study, the patient  number cannot be reassigned to another 
patient . The patient  number will be used to assign patient s to one of the 2 treatment groups 
according  to the randomization schedule. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Drug Randomization 
Only qualified patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be randomized and will receive study medication starting at Visit 2 (Day  0). 
Eligible patients  will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatment group s. Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_816718] , use of ezetimibe and by [CONTACT_101820] 
(Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific countries) (See Section 3.10). 
Approximately 70 % of randomized patients will be in the CV Risk Category  1, including 
patients with established CVD, and approximately 30% of randomized patients will be in the 
CV Risk Category  2, including patients with diabetes and at least one additional risk factor 
but no e stablished CVD. Enrollment with patients of a CV risk category will be stopped 
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 69 of 132 when the planned number of patients in that risk category is reached. If total study enrollment 
exceeds 7990 patients, enrollment of new patients will be limited to CV Risk Category  1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Emergency Unblinding  
In an emergency, when knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment is essential for the 
clinical management or welfare of the patient, the investigator may request th e patient’s 
treatment assignment for unblinding. Prior to unblinding the patient’s individual treatment assignment, the investigator should assess the relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug (Yes or No). If the blind is broken for any reason, the investigator must record the date and reason for breaking the blind on the appropriate Case Report Form (CRF) and source documents. 
7.1.3. Compliance Control  
It is recommended that, unless clear contraindications arise, patients be strongly encouraged 
to adhere to their treatm ent regimen with the study drug  for the duration of the trial. Any 
interruptions of therapy should, if possible, be brief (e.g., <4 weeks) and only for clinically indicated reasons, such as adverse events. While  reduction in study drug dose to fewer than 
4 capsules per day is discouraged, patients may remain on study medication at a reduced dose with approval by [CONTACT_1689]. Under such conditions, resumption of the dose of 
4 capsules per day should be att empted when/if medically appropriate.  Discontinuations will 
be discouraged as much as possible. Any discontinuations should be based on c ompelling clinical reasons.  
For every patient, an assessment of compliance to the study drug treatment regimen must be obtained at each scheduled visit. Study medication will be dispensed in amounts exceeding the amount required for the study. Patient s will be instructed to return all unused study 
medication at the next visit. Compliance to the study drug regimen will be e valuated at each 
visit by [CONTACT_618637]. Discrepancies will be evaluated and discussed with each 
patient  to assess compliance. If compliance is unsatisfactory , the patient  will be counseled 
about the importance of compliance to the dosing regime n. At the end of the study, the final 
study medication compliance will be determined by [CONTACT_816736] (see Section  
12.2.2) . 
7.2. Study  Restriction s 
7.2.1. Concomitant Medications  during Treatment/Follow -Up Period  
Any m edications administered during the study period must be documented on t he 
Concomitant Medication CRF. Patie nts must not have taken any investigational agent within 
90 days prior to screening. Patient s cannot participate in any other investigational medication 
trial while participating in this study.  
The following non- study drug related, non- statin, lipid -altering medications and  supplements, 
and foods  are prohibited during the study (from Visit [ADDRESS_1130993] Visit- End of 
Study), except for compelling medical reasons in patients  characterized as being Off Drug in 
Study (ODIS). A detailed description of ODIS is provided in S ection 11.1: 
 niacin >200 mg/day;  
 fibrates;

Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 70 of 132  prescription omega- 3 fatty acid medications;  
 dietary supplements containing omega -3 fatty acids (e.g., flaxseed, fish, krill, or 
algal oils); 
 bile acid sequestrants ; 
 PCSK9 inhibitors; 
 cyclophosphamide; 
 systemic retinoids  
If any of these products would be used during the treatment/follow -up period of the study, it 
should be for compelling medical reasons  in ODIS patients , and it should be documented in 
the Concomitant Medication CRF . If the ODIS patient agrees to restart study medication, the 
use of excluded medication must be discontinued. 
Foods enriched with omega -3 fatty acids  are strongly discouraged after Visit  1 for the 
duration of the study  (does not apply to the Netherlands  or Canada only . Therefore, all 
centers in the Netherlands  and Canada must ignore this request).  
The following products a re allowed: statins, ezetimibe , and herbal products & dietary 
supplements not containing omega- 3 fatty acids . 
Statins:  
 The same statin at the same dose should be continued until the end of the study, 
unless deemed medically necessary to change because of an adverse event or lack of 
efficacy (LOE).  It is preferred that if LOE is the determining factor that ezetimibe be 
added to the present dose. 
 Switching between a brand name [CONTACT_816952].  
 Statins may be administered with or with out ezetimibe.  
 Based on the FDA recommendation, simvastatin [ADDRESS_1130994] not experienced any muscle toxicity. (See reference:  FDA Drug Safety Commu nication: Ongoing safety 
review of high- dose Zocor (simvastatin) and increased risk of muscle injury. 
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatient
sandProviders/ucm204882.htm )  
 Changing of the type of statin or the statin dose during the treatment/follow -up 
period of the study should only be done for compelling medical reasons and must be documented i n the  CRF.  Maintaining statin therapy throughout the study is 
important and, in the rare circumstance that it b ecomes medically compelling to discontinue statin use, the patient may remain in the study and on study medication with approval from the Medical Moni tor. Under such conditions, resumption of 
statin therapy should be attempted when/if medically appropriate.

 If the level of LDL -C exceeds  130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) during the study  (initial 
measurement and confirmed by a second determination at  least 1 week later) , the 
investigator may either increase the dose of the present statin therapy or may add 
ezetimibe to lower LDL -C. The investigator should use the best clinical judg ment for 
each patient .  
No data are available with regard to potential interactions between ethyl -EPA and oral 
contraceptives. There are no r eports suggesting that omega -3 fatty acids, including ethyl -
EPA, would decrease the e fficacy of oral contraceptives.  
Medications that were excluded if not at a stable dose for ≥28 days prior to screening (see 
Section 4.2, C riterion 14), may be initiated post- randomization if medically warranted (i.e., 
tamoxifen, estrogens, progestins, thyroid hormone therapy, systemic corticosteroids and HIV-protease inhibitors). 
7.2.2. Patient  Restrictions  
Beginning at the screening visit, all patient s should be instructed to refrain from excessive 
alcohol consumption, to follow a physician recommended diet and to maintain it through the 
duration of the study . Excessive alcohol consumption is on average 2 units of alcohol  per 
day or drinking 5 units or more for men or 4 units or more for women in any one hour 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_816621]) . A unit of alcohol is defined as a 12-ounce

8.4.1. Dispensing Procedures  
At Visit 2 (Day  0), patient s will be assigned study drug according to their treatment group 
determined by [CONTACT_21477]. Once assigned to a treatment group, patient s will 
receive study drug supplies. At each visit, patient s will bring unused drug supplies dispensed 
to them earlier.  From the drug supplies assigned to each patient , site personnel will 
administer drug while the patients are at  the Research Site. 
The investigator or designee must contact [CONTACT_220137] S or a designee of the Sponsor for the 
study (if no IWR S is used)  when any unscheduled replacements of study medication are 
needed.  
During the last vi sit during the treatment period , patient s will bring the unused drug supplies 
for site personnel to calculate the final study medication compliance by [CONTACT_816736] 
(see Section 12.2.2). 
8.4.2. Storage Conditions 
At the Research Sites, s tudy drugs must be stored at room temperature, 68°F to 77°F (20°C

10.1. Specification of Variables and Procedures  
Safety assessments will include adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory measurements 
(chemistry, hematology), 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs (seated systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and body temperatur e), weight, waist 
circumference, and physical examinations as per Study Procedures/ Appendix A.   
A complete medical, surgical and family history will be completed at Visit 1.  
A list of the analytes to be measured for the safety evaluation is found in Secti on [IP_ADDRESS]. All 
laboratory test results must be evaluated by [CONTACT_816859]. Any observations at physical examinations or labora tory value s considered by [CONTACT_550198] . 
10.2. AEs 
An AE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with the medication under investigation. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medication product, whether or not related to the investigational medication product. All AEs, including observed or 
volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate CRF. Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, and causal relationship with the study 
medication or other factors.  
AEs, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored from the time of 
informed consent until study participation is complete. Patient s should be instructed to report 
any AE that they experience to the investigator. Beginning with Visit 2, investigators should 
assess for AEs at each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE  CRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_67442]. However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_093], it should be recorded as a separate AE  on the CRF. 
Any medical condition that is present when a patient is screened or present at baseline that 
does not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, medical conditions or signs 
or symptoms present at baseline and that  change in severity or seriousness at any time during 
the study should be reported as an AE . 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments th at are 
detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen will be reported as AEs or SAEs. The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in 
deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
The investigator will rate the severity (intensity) of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe, 
and will also categorize each AE as to its potential relationship to study drug using the 
categories of Yes or No.

Confidential and Proprietary  
Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 79 of 132 Sever ity: 
 Mild – An event that is usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with 
normal activities.  
 Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
activities.  
 Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity or 
inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
Causality Assessment:  
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed according 
to the following definitions: 
 No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the administration 
of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a cau sal 
relationship and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is 
suspected.  
 Yes (related, probabl y related, possibly related) – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consistent 
with a causal relationship and no ot her cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identif ied. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from study medication administration  
 The event should occur after the study medication is given. The length of time from 
study medication exposure to event should be evaluated in t he clinical context of the 
event.  
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases 
 Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the patient  may have.  
 Concomitant medicatio n 
 The other medications the patient  is taking or the treatment the patient  receives 
should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause 
the event in question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of study medication 
 Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to 
be a class effect.  
 Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses  
 The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the patient  and provide a 
logical and better explanation for the event.  
 The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study medication 
 The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion) of the study medication should be considered. 
Unexpected AEs – An unexpected AE is an AE either not previously reported or where the 
nature, seriousness, severity, or outcome is not consistent with the current Investigator’s Brochure.

Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 80 of 132 10.2.1. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse e vent (SAE ) is defined as an AE that meets any of the following criteria:  
 Results in death ; 
 Is life -threatening - Note : The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” 
refers to an event in which the patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event. It  
does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were 
more severe.  
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979] - Note : In general, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117706] a pre -existing condition(s) that did  not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE(s) and should not be reported as a SAE (s). 
 Results in disability/incapacity ; 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 Is an important medical even t- Note : Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may 
require medical or surgical interventio n to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency. 
By [CONTACT_816860]. The intention is that the endpoint events  are not 
reported to IRBs  as SAEs , unless the  IRB requires that these are reported . Investigators 
should specifically inform their institution/IRB of this plan and confirm whether or not they 
want the endpoint events reported. By [CONTACT_816861], these endpoints will also 
not be reported to the US FDA as SAEs ; rather  they will be reported as endpoint events.  
Following adjudication if the event is determined to not meet the criteria for a n event, the 
event will be evaluated as an SAE beginning with that day as Day 0. 
10.3. Serious Adverse Event Rep orting – Procedure for Investigators  
10.3.1. Initial Reports  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_1131001] 
administration of study medication (or until 28 days following study completion for ODIS 
patients) must be reported to the Sponsor  or designee  within 24 hours  of the knowledge of 
the occurrence (this refers to any AE that meets any of the aforementioned serious criteria). 
SAEs  that the investigator considers related to study medication occurring after the 28-day 
follow-up period will also be reported to the Sponsor or designee.  
The investigator is required to submit SAE reports to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or 
Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) in accordance with local requirements . All 
investigators involved in studies using the same investigational medicinal product (IMP) will 
receive any Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) reports for onward submission to their local IRB as required. All reports sent to investigators will be blinded.  
In add ition, r egulatory agencies will be notified of SAEs per the requirements of the specific 
regulatory jurisdiction regulations and laws.

Amendment #2: [ADDRESS_1131002] continue to follow the patient  until the SAE has subsided, or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the 
patient  dies. Within [ADDRESS_1131003] 
update the SAE form  electronically in the EDC system for the study  and submit any  
supporting documentation (e.g., laboratory test reports, patient  discharge summary, or 
autopsy reports) to the Sponsor or designee via fax or email.  
10.3.3. Reporting by [CONTACT_816862]. Cases w ill be 
unblinded for reporting purposes as required. 
10.4. Exposure in Utero  During Clinical Trials  
If a patient  becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator should report the pregnancy 
to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_1131004] the Exposure i n Utero  form to t he investigator for completion.  
The patient  should be followed by [CONTACT_256300]. If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify the 
Sponsor or designee. At the completion of the pregnancy, the investigator will document the 
outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.

Patient s may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. Study drug 
administration may also be discontinued at any time, at the discretion of the investigator . In 
any case, follow -up for efficacy and safety should be continued in subjects that discontinue 
therapy, but remain in the study (i.e., ODIS patients). 
11.1. Reasons for Early Study Drug Discontinuation 
Study drug discontinuation should be avoided as much as possible, but may be done for any 
of the following reasons: 
 Patient  withdraws consent or requests early discontinuation from the  study for any 
reason . Patients should be encouraged to continue to participate in the study for the 
entire duration of the study even if they choose not to take study medication any 
longer. 
 Occurrence of a clinical or laborat ory AE, either serious or non- serious, at the  
discretion of the investigator. The Sponsor or designee  should be notified if a patient 
discontinue s study drug  because of an AE or laboratory abnormality. It is 
recommended that, unless clear contraindications  arise, patients be strongly 
encouraged to adhere to their treatment regimen with the study drug for the duration of the trial. Any interruptions of therapy should, if possible, be brief (e.g., <4 weeks) and only for clinically indicated r easons, such as AEs. The following should be 
considered reason s for study drug discontinuation: 
o ALT  >3 × ULN and bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN  
o ALT >5 × ULN  
o ALT >3 × ULN and appearance or worsening of hepatitis 
o ALT >3 × ULN persisting for >4  weeks  
o ALT  >3 × ULN and cannot be monitored weekly for 4 weeks 
 Any medical condition or personal circumstance that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], exposes the patient  to risk by [CONTACT_816863] . 
 Sponsor discontinues the study. 
 Investigative site closure, in the event that: 
o Another investigative site cannot accommodate the patient, or  
o The patient is unable or unwilling  to travel to another investigative site.  
 A TG value that is flagged as critically high, i.e., >1000 mg/ dL (11.29 mmol/L), and 
confirmed as critically high by a repeat measurement (new fasting blood sample) 
within 7 days. In this case, a patient may be discontinued from study drug (with the 
option to remain ODIS) and other lipid -altering medications may be ( re)initiated.  If 
the TG value is flagged as >2000 mg/dL  (22.58 mmol/L) then appropriate medical 
action can  be taken by [CONTACT_816864]. 
Occurrence of an outcome event according to the judgment of the investigator is not 
considered a valid reason for study drug discontinuation.

Patients who continue in the study after  ≥30 days after  cessation of therapy will be 
characterized as ODIS. ODIS patients should be asked to return to the study site for an 
interim visit once the patient has been off study drug for >[ADDRESS_1131006] the option to 
restart study medication at any point once characterized as ODIS.  For patients who 
discontinue study medication (e.g., for an AE that may or may not be drug -related), a brief

soon as clinically appropriate; thereby [CONTACT_17155] a causative role for study medication to be confirmed or ruled out and continuing a patient in the study and on study drug i f appropriate . 
The reason for study drug discontinuation or interruption will be recorded on the CRF . 
11.2. Follow- Up after Early Study Drug Discontinuation/Lost to Follow- Up 
 Patients who prematurely discontinue study drug are not to be replaced. 
 All randomized patients must be followed up a ccording to the study  schedule of 
procedures  until the study end date or death, regardless of whether they discontinue 
study drug prematurely or not. Any event occurring after early study drug discontinuation will be recorded up through the study end date. 
 In order to follow the medical status of the patients, especially when they 
discontinued the study, investigators are encouraged to obtain information from the 
patient’s primary care practitioner (physician or any other medical care provider). Investigators are also requested to try as much as possible to re -contact [CONTACT_816865], and thus avoid lost to f ollow- up for the efficacy 
assessment.  
 If patients are lost to follow -up, the CRF  must be completed up to the last visit or 
contact.

12.1.1. Intent -to-Treat Population 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will include all patients w ho are randomized via the 
IWRS. All efficacy analyses, including the primary analysis, will be performed on the ITT 
population.  Patients will be analyzed according to the randomized treatment. 
12.1.2. Modified Intent -to-Treat Population  
The Modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT) population will include all randomized patients who 
have study drug dispensed after randomization. Groups will be defined based on t he 
randomized treatment.  
12.1.3. Per-Protocol Population  
The Per -Protocol (PP) population will include all mITT patients without any major protocol 
deviations, and who had ≥80% compliance while on treatment.  To be included in the PP population the minimum time on therapy is 90 days.   
12.1.4. Safety Population 
All safety analyses will be conducted based on the Safety po pulation, which is defined as all 
randomized patients. This is the same as the ITT population.  12.2. Statistical Methods  
Safety and efficacy variables will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods to be 
described in detail in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized before study unblinding. 
12.2.1. Patient  Disposition and Demographic/Baseline Characteristics

primary reason. 
For randomized patient s who discontinue d treatment  with study drug, the primary reason for 
discontinuation will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics, including age, gender, ethnicity, race, height, body 
weight, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, overweight/obese/normal according to BMI, and diabetes plus obesity will be summarized using descriptive  statistics 
by [CONTACT_138862].  
Demographi c data and baseline characteristics will be also compared between  treatment 
groups for the mITT  population and PP population. Differences in demographic and baseline 
characteristics will be tested using a chi -square test (for categorical variables) or t -test (for 
continuous variables). The p- values will be considered  descriptive, primarily as an 
assessment of the balance between groups . Age in years will be calculated using the date of 
randomization (Visit 2) and the date of birth. 
12.2.2. Study Medication Exposure  and Compliance  
Study drug exposure will be summarized by [CONTACT_816866]. Overall study drug c ompliance will be calculated as the number 
of doses assumed to be taken relative to scheduled dosing period as follows: 
Compliance (%) = ( # Capsules of total dispensed - # Capsules of total returned)  × 100 
                        (last dose date – first dose date + 1) × 4 capsules/day  
Overall percent compliance will be calculated per patient  in the ITT and Modified ITT

[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Endpoint  Analyses 
The primary endpoint  is described in  Section 9.2.1. The analysis of the primary endpoint  will 
be performed using the log- rank test comparing the 2 treatment groups (AMR101 and 
placebo) and including the stratification factor “CV risk category ”, use of ezetimibe and 
geographical region (Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific countries)  (each  as 
recorded in the IWR S at the time of enrollment) as covariates . The two -sided alpha level for 
the primary analysis will be reduced from 0.05 to account for the interim analyses  based on a 
group sequential design with O’Brien- Fleming boundaries generated using the Lan- DeMets 
alpha- spending function. The hazard ratio for treatment group (AMR101 vs . placebo) from a 
Cox proportional hazard model that includes the stratification factor will also be reported, 
along with the associated 95% confidence interval. Kaplan- Meier estimates from  
randomization to the time to the primary endpoint will be plotted .  
The size and direction of the treatment effects of the individual components of the composite 
endpoint and their relative contribution to the composite endpoint will be determined as well. 
All observed data that are positively adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741], including data after 
discontinuation of study treatment for patients who discontinue study drug prematurely, will be included in the primary analysis.
 
Patients who do not experience a primary efficacy event prior to the end of the study or who 
withdraw from the study early without a preceding primary efficacy e vent will be censored at 
the date of their last visit/phone contact.  
The longest prespecified interval between visits (onsite or phone) is [ADDRESS_1131007] tracing indicative of a silent MI; a second (sensitivity) analysis will assume that all silent MIs occurred on the day after the last prior normal ECG; and a third (sensitivity) analysis will 
assume that all silent MIs occurred at the mid -point between the last normal ECG and the 
ECG with the new MI.  
All deaths causally adjudicated as “undetermined” will be combined with those adjudicated as “CV deaths” for the primary analysis. A sensitivity analysis of the CV death category will 
be performed that excludes the “undetermined cause of death” cohort.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT population. A sensitivi ty analysis 
will be performed using the mITT and PP populations. 
As a sensitivity analysis, patients who discontinue study drug prematurely will be censored 
for the primary composite endpoint analysis on t he date of drug discontinuation.  The 
primary analy sis will be repeated using this censoring rule for the mITT population.

The randomization visit will be conside red Baseline.  If a baseline value is not available from 
the randomization visit, then the latest screening value will be used.  
For measurements of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], lipoproteins , and inflammatory markers, the change from

[IP_ADDRESS]. Interim Efficacy Analys es 
Two interim analys es are planned for the primary efficacy endpoint using adjudicated events  
when  approximately 60%  (967 events)  and approximately 80% (1290 events) of the total 
number of primary endpoint events planned (1612) is reached. The planned interim analyses 
are based on a group- sequential design and are described in the Interim Statistical Analysis 
Plan (included as an appendix to the SAP) which will be finalized prior to performing the 
unblinded interim analyses. 
The interim results of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_105231] ( DMC). The analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_816875] D MC.  Unblinded 
information will not be released to the S ponsor before the completion of the study unless 
extraordinary circumstances arise and, under such circumstances , procedures for maintaining 
confidentiality will be described in a written agreement with the DMC . If the study is 
terminated early following interim analysis, patients will be notified promptly and brought in 
for their final close -out visit, and the final analyses of efficacy and safety will include all data 
through their final visit.  
All suspected events will be adjudicated in a blinded manner by [CONTACT_15741]. The time to event will be calculated as the time from randomization to the onset date of the 
event (as determined by [CONTACT_15741]). Patients who do not experience any of the above events at the time of data cutoff for the interim but are still in the trial will be considered censored at 
the time of their last regular contact [CONTACT_816876] . 
12.2.5. Analysis of Safety 
All analyses of safety will be conducted on t he safety population, which is defined as all randomized patient s. The safety assessment will be based on the frequency of AEs, physical 
exams, vital signs and safety laboratory tests.  
AEs with new onset during the study between the initiation of study drug and 30 days after 
the completion or withdrawal from study  will be considered treatment- emergent (TE AEs). 
This will include any AE with onset prior to initiation of study drug and increased severity after the treatment initiation.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_72065], and by t reatment. This will include overall incidence rates (regardless of severity and

baseline for each of the parameters u sing descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_1570]. Those

Additional safety parameters will be summarized in data listings.  
12.3. Sample Size Determination  
This is an event -drive n trial comparing the effect of AMR101 vs. placebo in terms of the 
composite endpoint listed above as the primary endpoint . The study has been planned to 
accrue a total of 1612 e fficacy endpoint events with two planned interim analyses when 
approximately 9 67 (60%) and 1290 (80%) of the events have been adjudicated . 
Sample size calculation was based on assumptions of constant hazard, asymmetric recruitment rate over time and without factoring for dropouts. A risk reduction corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.85 (AMR101 vs. placebo) is assumed. [ADDRESS_1131014] ratio with approximately 90% power with one -sided alpha -level at 2.5% 
and with two interim analyses.  The operating characteristics of this design are identical to 
those of a corresponding group sequential design with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
The recruitment period is assumed to be 4.2 years with 20% recruitment in the first year, 
40% in the second year, 20% in the third year, 19% in the fourth year and the remaining 1% in the last 0.2 years. The estimated  maximum study duration is 6.5 years unless the trial is 
terminated early for efficacy or safety issues. A one -year event rate of 5.2% (hazard = 0.053) 
in the control arm is also assumed. Under these assumptions  the number of patients to be 
enrolled is N = 7990. 
Since this is an events -driven trial, the ‘sample size’ is the number of events rather than the 
number of patients. The number of events that occur depends primarily on three factors: how 
many patients ar e enrolled, the combined group event rate, and how long the patients are 
followed. Because of the difficulty in predicting the combined event rate, the sponsor  will 
monitor that event rate as the trial progresses. If the combined event rate is less than 
anticipated, either increasing the number of patients, extending the length of follow -up, or a 
balance of adjusting both factors may be necessary to achieve the sample size of [ADDRESS_1131015] 1 adjudicated, primary event 
(and appropriately accounting for patients with potential primary events for which the 
adjudicatio n process is then incomplete) was consistent with projections, then the s tudy could 
continue toward the protocol -specified target enrollment of 7990 patients.  However, if t he 
number of such events appeared  less than, and inconsistent with projections, the Sponsor 
would consider (under blinded conditions) re -calculating the number of patients needed to 
achieve the target number of events within the desired timeline or extend the follow -up 
period.  If the projected i ncrease in number of patients was  ≤25% of the original 7990 target 
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  
Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 92 of 132 population, the Sponsor could, with documented approval of both the REDUCE -IT Steering 
Committee and the Data Monitoring Committee, extend enrollment to the revised target 
number without need for an additional protocol amendment.   Under those conditions, all principal investigators, ethics committees, and regulatory authorities associated with the protocol will be promptly notified of the action. If the projected increase in number of 
patients was more than 25% above the original 7990 target ( i.e. more than 1998 additional 
patients) a formal protocol amendment would be initiated.  
Consistent with the plan stated above, an analysis and modeling of pooled, blinded primary efficacy endpoint events across the remainder of the trial was performed prior to the projected enrollment of the 7990
th patient. Based on this analysis, the sample size of 7990 
randomized patients is with 95% confidence likely to result in the target 1,612 adjudicated primary efficacy events within 2018.  T he results of this analysis were shared with and approved by [CONTACT_816877]- IT Steering Committee and Data Monitoring Committee.  
As of the  completion of study enrollment, the actual number of patients randomized will vary 
from the target number (either original or revised) as a result of the inherent lag between the date the last patient star ted screening and the date the last patient was randomized.

of all clinical trials that it sponsors. Before the enrollment of any patient in this study, the 
Sponsor or its designee  will review with the investigator and site personnel the following 
documents : protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, CRFs and procedures for their completion, the 
informed consent process, and the procedure for reporting SAEs. Site visits will be

Prior to participation in a study, the participant, or participant’s legal represen tative/impartial 
witness  must sign an IRB/IEC -approved written informed consent form (ICF). The approved 
written informed consent must abide to all applicable laws in regards to the safety and 
confidentiality of the patients. To obtain and document informed consent, the Investigator should comply with applicable regulations; adhere to GCP standards and the ethical principles in the Declaration of Helsinki (see Section 16). 
The language in the oral and written information about the trial, including the written informed consent form should be as non- technical as practical and should be understandable 
to the participant or participant’s legal representative /impartial witness, where applicable. 
Before informed consent is obtained, the Investigator should provide the participant, or participant’s legal representative/impartial witness  ample time and opportunity to inquire 
about the trial and to decide whether or not to participate.  
All questions about the trial should be answered to the satisfaction of the participant, or the participant’s legal representative/impartial witness . The written ICF should be signed and 
personally dated by [CONTACT_82976]’s lega l representative/impartial witness , and 
by [CONTACT_28490]. Participants will be informed that participation is voluntary and that he/she can withdraw from the study at any time. A signed copy of the consent form must be given to the participant, and this fact will be documented in the CRF. 
Of special concern regarding informed consent is the collection of blood samples for genetic 
analysis. Local regulations may not allow the collection of blood samples for genetic testing 
or the shipment of blood samples for genetic testing outside the region. In these cases, blood samples for genetic testing will not be collected , and the  portion of the ICF describing the 
genetic component of the study will not be included. If blood samples for genetic testing will be collected, the ICF will clearly indicate that a sample will be drawn for this purpose, but that the participant has the right to refuse this procedure. 
18. PUBLICATION POLICY  
The SC is  responsible for the reporting and publication of the study results. The Sponsor will 
be provided a reasonable opportunity to review such manuscripts prior to journal submission. 
The results of the study will be published irrespective of whether the endpoints are met, or 
whether the results are regarded  positive or negative. 
 
Confidentiality, publication, and patent applications related to unpublished study -related 
information and unpublished information given to the  site investigator s by [CONTACT_810110]/or its designee(s)  shall be handled as set forth in the Clinical Trial Agreement .

23.1. Definition of Cardiovascular Death 
Cardiovascular death includes death resulting from an acute myocardial infarction, sudden 
cardiac death, death due to congestive heart failure (CHF), death due to stroke, death due to 
cardiovascular (CV) procedures, death due to CV hemorrhage, and death due to ot her 
cardiovascular causes.  
1. Death due to Acute Myocardial Infarction  refers to a d eath by [CONTACT_816767] 
(arrhythmia, CHF) within 30 days after a MI related to the immediate consequences of the MI, such as progressive CHF or recalcitrant arrhythmia.   
Mortal events that occur after a “break” (e.g., a CHF and arrhythmia- free period of at 
least a week) should be classified as CV or non- CV death, and if classified as a CV death, 
should be attributed to the immediate cause, even though the MI may have increased the risk of that event (e.g., the risk of arrhythmic death is increased for many months after an acute MI).  
Acute MI should be verified to the extent possible by [CONTACT_576321] (see Definition of MI) or by [CONTACT_816883]. 
Death resulting from a procedure to treat a MI (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_10956] (CABG)), or to treat a complication resulting from MI, should also be considered death due to acute MI.  
Death resulting from an elective coronary procedure to treat myocardial ischemia (i.e., 
chronic stable angina) or death due to a MI that occurs as a direct consequence of a CV investigation/procedure/operation should be considered as a death due to a CV procedure. 
2. Sudden Cardiac Death refers to a death that occurs unexpectedly, not within 30 days of  
an acute MI, and includes the following deaths: 
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Pr oprietary  
Amendment #2: [ADDRESS_1131036] an acute MI 
c. Death witnessed and attributed to an identified arrhythmia (e.g., captured on an electrocardiographic (ECG) recording, witnessed on a  monitor, or unwitnessed but found on implantable cardioverter- defibrillator review)  
d. Death after unsuccessful resuscitation from cardiac arrest  
e. Death after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest and without identification of a non- cardiac etiology  
f. Unwitnessed death without other cause of death (information regarding the patient’s clinical status preceding death should be provided, if available) 
General Considerations  
A subject seen alive and clinically stable 12 -24 hours prior to being found dead 
without any evidence or information of a specific cause of death should be 
classified as “sudden  cardiac death.”  
Deaths for which there is no information beyond “patient found dead at home” will be 
classified as “death due to other cardiovascular causes ”. Please s ee Definition of 
Undetermined Cause of Death, for full details. 
3. Death due to Congestive Heart Failure refers to a death in association with clinically 
worsening symptoms and/or signs of heart failure (see Definition of Heart Failure Event).  
Deaths due to heart failure can have various etiologies, including single or recurrent myocardial infarctions, ischemic or non- ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, or 
valvular disease.  
4. Death due to Stroke  refers to death after a stroke that is either a direct consequence of 
the stroke or a complication of the stroke.  Acute stroke should be verified to the extent 
possible by [CONTACT_816811] (see Definition of Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke).  
5. Death due to Cardiovascular Procedures refers  to death caused by [CONTACT_816812] a cardiac procedure.  
6. Death due to Cardiovascular Hemorrhage refers to death related to hemorrhage such 
as a non -stroke intracranial hemorrhage (see Definition of Transient Ischemic Attack and 
Stroke), non- procedural or non- traumatic vascular rupture (e.g., aortic aneurysm), or 
hemorrhage causing cardiac tamponade.   
7. Death due to Other Cardiovascular Causes  refers to a CV death not included in the 
above categories (e.g., pulmonary embolism or peripheral arter ial disease).  
23.2. Definition of Non -Cardiovascular Death 
Non-cardiovascular death  is defined as any death that is not thought to be due to a 
cardiovascular cause. The following is a suggested list of non- cardiovascular  causes of death 
for this trial.

Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 114 of 132  Renal  
 Gastrointestinal 
 Hepatobiliary  
 Pancreatic  
 Infection (includes sepsis)  
 Non-infectious (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)) 
 Hemorrhage that is neither cardiovascular bleeding nor a stroke  
 Accidental (e.g., physical accidents or drug overdoses) or trauma  
 Suicide 
 Prescription Drug Error (e.g., prescribed drug overdose, use of inappropriate drug, or 
drug-drug interaction) 
 Neurological process that is not a stroke or hemorrhage 
 Other non- CV, specify: _________________ 
23.2.2. Malignancy 
Malignancy should be coded as the cause of death if:  
o Death results directly from the cancer; or  
o Death results from a concurrent illness that could be a consequence of a cancer or  
o Death results from withdrawal of other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816684]  
o Death results from an illness that is not a consequence of a cancer  
Cancer deaths may arise from cancers that were present prior to randomization or which 
developed subsequently. It may be helpful to distinguish these two scenarios (i.e. worsening of 
prior malignancy; new malignancy).  
 Suggested categorization includes the following organ systems; Lung/larynx, breast, 
leukemia/lymphoma, upper GI, melanoma, central nervous  system, colon/rectum, 
renal, bladder, prostate, other/unspecified, or unknown.  
23.3. Definition of Undetermined Cause of Death  
Undetermined Cause of Death  refers to a death not attributable to one of the above 
categories of cardiovascular death or to a non- cardiovascular cause.  The inability to classify 
the cause of death  is generally  due to lack of information (e.g., the only available information 
is “patient died”) or when  there is insufficient supporting information or detail to assign the 
cause of death. In this trial, when a cause of death is not readily apparent (e.g., found dead at 
home), the cause will be assumed to be cardiovascular in origin, unless one of the following 
two scenarios occur:  
1. There is no information or data available regarding the circumstances of death other 
than that a death has occurred.  
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Pr oprietary  
Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 115 of 132 2. The available data are conflicting regarding whether the death was cardiovascular or 
non-cardiovascular.  
23.4. Definition of Myocardial Infarction 
1. General Considerations  
The term myocardial infarction (MI) should be used when there is evidence of 
myocardial  necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia.  In 
general, the diagnosis of MI requires the combination of:  
 Evidence of myocardial necrosis (either changes in cardiac biomarkers or 
postmortem  pathological findings); and  
 Supporting information derived from the clinical presentation, electrocardiographic changes, or the results of myocardial or coronary artery 
imaging  
The totality of the clinical, electrocardiographic, and cardiac biom arker information 
should be  considered to determine whether or not a M I has occurred. Specifically, 
timing and trends in  cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiographic information require 
careful analysis. The adjudication of MI should also take into account the clinical 
setting in which the event occurs.  MI may be adjudicated for an event that has 
characteristics of a MI but which does not meet the  strict definition because 
biomarker or electrocardiographic results are not available.  
2. Criteria for Myocardial Infarction  
a. Clinical Presentation  
The clinical presentation should be consistent with diagnosis of myocardial ischemia  and infarction. Other findings that might support the diagnosis of MI 
should be take into account because a number of conditions are associ ated 
with elevations in cardiac  biomarkers (e.g., trauma, surgery, pacing, ablation, 
congestive heart failure,  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, 
severe pulmonary hypertension, stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
infiltrative and inflammatory disorders of cardiac  muscle, drug toxicity, burns, 
critical illness, extreme exertion, and chronic kidney  disease). Supporting 
information can also be considered from myocardial imaging and coronary 
imaging. The totality of the data may help differentiate acute MI from the 
background disease process. 
b. Biomarker Elevation 
For cardiac biomarkers, laboratories should report an upper reference limit 
(URL). If the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit (URL) from the 
respective laboratory  performing the assay is not available, then the URL for 
myocardial necrosis from the  laboratory should be used. If the 99th percentile 
of the URL or the URL for myocardial  necrosis is not available, the MI 
decision limit f or the particular laboratory should be  used as the U RL. 
Laboratories can also report both the 99th percentile of the upper  reference 
limit and the MI decision limit. Reference limits from the laboratory  
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Pr oprietary  
Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 116 of 132 performing the assay are preferred over the manufacturer’s listed reference 
limits in an  assay’s instruct ions for use. CK -MB and troponin are preferred, 
but CK may be used in the absence of CK -MB and troponin. 
For MI subtypes, different biomarker elevations for CK, CK -MB, or troponin 
will be  required. The specific criteria will be referenced to the URL.  
In th is study, patients may present acutely to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816685], it is not practical to stipulate the use of a single biomarker or assay, and the locally available results are to be used as the basis for 
adjudication.  Since the prognostic significance of different types of myocardial infarctions 
(e.g.,  periprocedural myocardial infarction versus spontaneous myocardial 
infarction) may be  different, considerations evaluating outcomes for these 
subsets of patients separately will be  made.  
c. ECG Changes  
ECG  changes can be used to support or confirm a MI. Supporting  evidence 
may be ischemic changes and confirmatory information may be new Q waves.  
 Criteria for acute myocardial ischemia (in absence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and  left bundle branch block 
(LBBB)) : 
o ST elevation  
New ST elevation at the J point in two anatomically contiguous leads with the  cut-off points: ≥ 0.2 mV in men (> 0.25 mV in 
men < 40 years) or ≥ 0.15 mV in women in leads V2-V3 and/or 
≥ 0.[ADDRESS_1131037] depression ≥ 0.05 mV in two contiguous  leads; 
and/or new T inversion ≥ 0.1 mV in two contiguous leads.  
The above ECG criteria illustrate patterns consistent with myocardial ischemia. In  patients with abnormal biomarkers, it is  recognized that lesser 
ECG abnormalities may  represent an ischemic response and may be accepted 
under the category of abnormal  ECG findings. 
 Criteria for pathological Q-wave 
o Any Q -wave in leads V2 -V3 ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_1131038] ≥ 0.03 seconds and ≥ 0.1 mV deep or QS complex in leads I, II, aVL,  aVF, or V4 -V6 in any two leads of a 
contiguous lead groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (I, aVL, V6; V4- V6; II, III, and aVF)  
o R-wave 0.04 s in V1–V2 and R/S ratio >[ADDRESS_1131039] lead groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

3. Myocardial Infarction Subtypes 
Several MI subtypes are commonly reported in clinical investigations and each is 
defined  below:  
a. Spontaneous MI  
i. Detection of rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers with at least one value above the URL with at least one of the following:  
 Clinical presentation consistent with ischemia  
 ECG evidence of acute myocardial ischemia  
 New pathological Q waves  
 Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional 
wall motion abnormality  
 Autopsy evidence of acute MI  
ii. If biomarkers are elevated from a prior infarction, then a spontaneous myocardial  infarction is defined as:  
1. One of the following:  
 Clinical presentation consistent with ischemia

suspected MI*  
 ≥ 20% increase (and > URL) in troponin or CK- MB 
between a measurement made at the time of the initial 
presentation and a further sample taken 3-6 hours later

then a definite diagnosis of recurrent MI is  generally 
not possible.

values (≤99th percentile URL), or a rise of [cardiac biomarker] values ≥20% if 
baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling.  This classification also 
requires at least 1 of the following:

Peri-coronary artery by[CONTACT_10956] (CABG) MI is defined by [CONTACT_70135].  Symptoms of cardiac ischemia are not required.  
i. Biomarker elevations within 48 hours of CABG:  
 Troponin or CK -MB (preferred) > 1 0  x 99th percentile of the 
URL and  
 No evidence that cardiac biomarkers were elevated prior to the procedure;  
OR 
 Both of the following must be true:

23.6. Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816686] : 
1. Ischemic discomfort (angina, or symptoms thought to be equivalent) ≥ 10 minutes in 
duration occurring 
 at rest, or  
 in an accelerating pattern with frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_816628].  
AND 
2. Prompting an unscheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] [ADDRESS_1131042] a 2 4* hour stay (or a date change if the time of 
admission/discharge is not available). 
AND 
3. At least one of the following: 
a. New or worsening ST or T wave changes on resting ECG (in the absence of 
confounders, such as LBBB or LVH) 
 Transient ST elevation (duration <20 minutes) 
New ST elevation at the J point in two anatomically contiguous leads with 
the cut -off points:  ≥0.2 mV in men (>0.25 mV in men <40 years) or ≥0.15 
mV i n women in leads V2-V3 and/or ≥0.1 mV in other leads 
 ST depression and T- wave changes  
New horizontal or down-slopi[INVESTIGATOR_345482] ≥ 0.05 mV in two 
contiguous leads; and/or new T inversion ≥ 0.1 mV in two contiguous 
leads.  
b. Definite evidence of inducible myocardial ischemia as demonstrated by:  
 An early positive exercise stress tes t, def ined as ST elevation or ≥ [ADDRESS_1131043] depression prior to 5 mets  
OR 
 Stress echocardiography (reversible wall motion abnormality)  OR 
 Myocardial scintigraphy (reversible perfusion defect), OR

revascularization was undertaken during the unscheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or subsequent to transfer to another institution without interceding home discharge.  
AND 
4. Negative cardiac biomarkers and no evid ence of acute MI  
General Considerations  
1. Escalation of pharmacotherapy for ischemia, such as intravenous nitrates or increasing  dosages of β- blockers, should be considered supportive of the diagnosis of 
unstable angina.  However, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_816630], without any of the additional findings listed under 
category 3, would be insufficient alone to support classification as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929].  
2. If subjects are admitted with suspec ted unstable angina, and subsequent testing 
reveals a noncardiac or non- ischemic etiology, this event should not be recorded as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816687]. Potential ischemic events meeting the criteria for 
myocardial infarction  should not be adjudicated as unstable angina.  
3. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257353] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816688] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929]. For e xample,  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a patient with stable exertional angina for coronary 
angiography and PCI that is prompted by a positive outpatient stress test 
should not be considered hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929]. 
 Re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a patient meeting  the criteria for unstable angina who 
was stabilized, discharged, and subsequently readmitted for revascularization, does not constitute a second hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929] 
4. A patient who undergoes an elective catheterization where incidental coronary artery disease is found and who subsequently undergoes coronary revascularization will not be considered as meeting the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575728].  
 
23.7. Definition of Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke  
Transient Ischemic Attack  
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a transient epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (< 24 hours) of neurological dysfunction caused by [CONTACT_816815], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction.  
Stroke  
Stroke is defined as an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_816606], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retinal vascular injury.  
Classification:  
1. Ischemic Stroke  
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Pr oprietary  
Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 123 of 132 Ischemic stroke is defined as an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_196545], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], or retinal  
dysfunction caused by [CONTACT_816885].  
Hemorrhage may be a consequence of ischemic stroke. In this situation, the stroke is 
an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation and not a hemorrhagic stroke. 
2. Hemorrhagic Stroke  
Hemorrhagic stroke is defined as an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_816689] a nontraumatic intraparenchymal, intraventricular, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.  NOTE: Microhemorrhages seen on T2- weighted MRI imaging, subdural and epi[INVESTIGATOR_816690].  
3. Undetermined Stroke  
Undetermined stroke is defined as an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_575732], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retinal vascular injury as a result of hemorrhage or infarction but  with insufficient information to allow  
categorization as ischemic or hemorrhagic.  
Stroke Disability  
Stroke disability should be measured by a reliable and valid scale in all cases, typi[INVESTIGATOR_575734] 90 days after the event. For example, the modified Rankin Scale may be used 
to address this requirement: 
Scale  Disability  
0 No symptoms at all 
1 No significant disability despi[INVESTIGATOR_5119]; able to carry out all usual duties and activities.  
2 Slight disability; unable to perform all previous activities but able to look after own affairs 
without assistance.  
3 Moderate disability; requiring some help but able to walk without assistance.  
4 Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to 
own bodily needs without assistance. 
5 Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent, and requiring constant nursing care and 
attention. 
6 Dead  
Additional Considerations  
Evidence of vascula r central nervous system injury without recognized neurological 
dysfunction may be observed. Examples include  micro -hemorrhage, silent infarction, and 
silent hemorrhage.  
Subdural hematomas are intracranial hemo rrhagic events and not strokes. 
The distinction between a Transient Ischemic Attack and an Ischemic Stroke is the presence 
of Infarction. Persistence of symptoms is an acceptable indicator of acute infarction.

23.9. Interventional Cardiology Definitions 
A.  Clinical Definitions  
1. Clinically -Driven Target Lesion Revascularization : Revascularization is clinically -
driven if the target lesion diameter stenosis is > 50% by [CONTACT_576326] (QCA) and the subject has clinical or functional ischemia which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_816886]. Clinical or functional ischemia includes any of the following: 
a. A history of angina pectoris, presumably related to the target vessel 
b. Objective signs of ischemia at rest (electrocardiographic changes) or during exercise test (or equivalent), presumably related to the target vessel  
c. Abnormal results of any invasive functional diagnostic test (e.g., coronary flow reserve [CFR] or fractional flow reserve [FFR])  
Amarin Pharma Inc.  Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
 
Confidential and Pr oprietary  
Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 126 of 132 Comment : Target lesion revascularization of a > 70% diameter stenosis by [CONTACT_816887]- driven.  
Comment : In the absence of QCA data or if a ≤ 50% stenosis is present, TLR may be 
considered clinically- driven by [CONTACT_569130] (CEC) if severe 
ischemic signs and symptoms attributed to the target lesion are present. 
2. Non-Target Lesion and Non -Target Lesion Revascularization : A lesion for which 
revascularization is not attempted or one in which revascularization is performed 
using a non- study device, respectively.  
3. Non-Target Vessel and Non -Target Vessel Revascularization : A vessel for which  
revascularization is not attempted or one in which revascularization is performed using a non- study device, respectively.  
4. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Status : 
a. Elective: The procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis or during a subseque nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816694] (MI) 
or death. For stable in-patients, the procedure is being performed during this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816695]'s clinical situation  demands the procedure prior to discharge.  
b. Urgent:  The procedure should be performed on an inpatient basis and prior to 
discharge because of significant concerns that there is risk of myocardial ischemia, MI, and/or death. Patients who are outpatients or in the emergency department at the time that the cardiac catheterization is requested would warrant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575720]. 
c. Emergency :  The procedure should be performed as soon as possible because of 
substantial concerns that ongoing myocardial ischemia and/or MI could lead to death. "As soon as possible" refers to a patient who is of sufficient acuity that one would cancel a scheduled case to perform this procedure immediately in the next available room during business hours, or one would activate the on- call team were 
this to occur during off-hours. 
d. Salvage:  The procedure is a last resort. The patient is in cardiogenic shock when 
the PCI begins (i.e., the time at which the first guide wire or intracoronary device is introd uced into a coronary artery or by[CONTACT_816820]) OR within the last ten minutes prior to the start of the case or 
during the diagnostic portion of the case, the patient has also received chest compressions or has been on unanticipated circulatory support (e.g., intra- aortic 
balloon pump, extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation, or cardiopulmonary support). 
5. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention  (PCI):  Placement of an angioplasty guide 
wire, balloon, or other device (e.g ., stent, atherectomy catheter, brachytherapy 
delivery device, or thrombectomy catheter) into a native coronary artery or coronary artery by[CONTACT_576330].  In the

ultrasound, CFR, or FFR , insertion of a guide wire will NOT  be considered PCI. 
23.10. Definition of Peripheral Vascular Intervention  
1. Peripheral Vascular Intervention (PVI) : Peripheral vascular intervention is a 
catheter -based or open surgical procedure designed to improve peripheral arterial or 
venous blood flow or otherwise modify or revise vascular conduits. Procedures may 
include, but are not limited to, balloon angioplasty, stent placement, thrombectomy, embolectomy, atherectomy, dissection repair, aneurysm exclusion, treatment of dialysis conduits, placement of various devices, intravascular thrombolysis or other pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and open surgical by[CONTACT_576335].  
In general, the intention to perform percutaneous  peripheral vascular intervention is 
denoted by [CONTACT_434338] a guide wire into a peripheral artery or vein. 
The target vessel(s) and the type of revascularization procedure (e.g., surgical by[CONTACT_6476], 
thrombectomy, endarterectomy, percutaneous angioplasty, stent placement, thromboembolectomy, and thrombolysis) should be specified and recorded. For the sake of simplicity, this definition applies to the extracranial carotid artery and other non-cardiac arteries  and veins and excludes the intracranial vessels and lymphatics.  
2. Procedural Status: Non -Elective and Elective:   
a. Non-Elective:  Non -elective procedures include emergent and urgent procedures. A 
non-elective procedure is a procedure that is performed witho ut delay, because 
there is clinical consensus that the procedure should occur imminently. Non-elective procedures imply a degree of instability of the patient, urgency of the medical condition, or instability of the threatening lesion.  
 Emergent: A procedure that is performed immediately because of the acute 
nature of the medical condition (e.g., acute limb ischemia, acute aortic dissection), and the increased morbidity or mortality associated with a temporal delay in treatment.  
 Urgent : An urgent procedure is one that is not emergent but required to be 
performed on a timely basis (≤ 24 hrs) (e.g., a patient who has been stabilized following initial treatment of acute limb ischemia, and there is clinical consensus that a definitive procedure should occur within the next 24 hours). 
b. Elective: An elective procedure is one that is scheduled and is performed on a 
patient with stable disease, or in whom there is no urgency and/or increased morbidity or mortality associated with a planned procedure. 
23.11. Definition of Any  Revascularization Procedure  
Any revascularization includes any arterial vascular intervention done to treat ischemia or prevent major ischemic events, including percutaneous or surgical intervention of the coronary, peripheral, or carotid arteries. Aneur ysm repairs, dissection repairs, arterial -venous 
fistula or graft placement or repairs, or renal arterial intervention for hypertension or renal dysfunction are not included.

Amendment #2: 8 July 2016  Page 128 of 132 23.12. Definition of Cardiac Arrhythmia Requiring Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816696] (≥24 hours) during or within [ADDRESS_1131046] epi[INVESTIGATOR_816697], including any one of the following: 
1. Atrial arrhythmia – atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia that 
requires cardio -version, drug therapy, or is sustained for greater than 1 minute) 
2. Ventricular arrhythmia - Ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation requiring 
cardio -versio n and/or intravenous anti arrhythmics  
3. Bradyarrhythmia - High -level AV block (defined as third- degree AV block or second-
degree AV block), junctional or ventricular escape rhythm, or severe sinus bradycardia 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_816698]  < 30 bpm). The brady cardia must require  temporary or permanent 
pacing.  
23.13. Definition of Cardiac Arrest (Sudden Cardiac Death)  
A sudden, unexpected death due to the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity, confirmed by [CONTACT_12204] a detectable pulse, unresponsiveness, and apnea (or agonal, gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_80566]) of presumed cardiac etiology. An arrest is presumed to be cardiac (i.e., related 
to heart disease) if this is likely, based on t he available information, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816699]. The cardiac arrest will be further sub- classified into either: 
a) witnessed, occurring within 60 min from the onset of new symptoms, in the absence of a clear cause other than cardiovascular; or  
b) unwitnessed, within 24 hours of being observed alive, in the absence of pre -existing other 
non-cardiovascular causes of death;  
Note: Non -cardiac causes of cardiac arrest, such as drug overdose, suicide, drowning, 
hypoxia, exsanguination, cerebrovascular accident, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or trauma must not be present. 
23.14. Definition of Resuscitated Cardiac Arres t
[ADDRESS_1131047] is present when there is restoration of both: 
1. Organized electrical activity, and  
2. Organized mechanical activity resulting in restoration of spontaneous circulation (defined 
as the documented presence of a measurable pulse and blood pressure at any time after 
initiation of resuscitative efforts) .

secondary endpoints were streamlined and re- ordered to further elucidate primary 
and key secondary findings.    
 Again in concert with FDA comments, several former secondary endpoints were moved to tertiary endpoints with definitions of such tertiary endpoints 
around metabolic syndrome and new -
onset hypertension provided.  
 
The “other” secondary objectives were designated and re- ordered as follows:  
 Composite of CV death or 
nonfatal MI (including silent MI);  
 Fatal or nonfatal MI (including 
silent MI);  
 Non- elective coronary 
revascularization represented as the composite of emergent or 
urgent classifications;  
 CV death;  
 Unstable angina determined to be caused by [CONTACT_816724]/non- invasive testing and 
requiring emergent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
 Fatal or nonfatal stroke;  
 Composite of total mortality, nonfatal MI (including silent MI), 
or nonfatal stroke;  
 Total mortality.  For consistency with Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP)

This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) has been developed based on Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
(Amendment #2 Final Version 3.0 d ated 8 July 2016 ). The SAP describes the statistical 
methods to be used for the final analysis and reporting of efficacy and safety data collected 
during the entire conduct of Protocol AMR -01-01- 0019, and has been developed and finalized 
prior to database lock and unblinding of the clinical database for Study AMR -01-01- 0019. A 
separate Interim Statistical Analysis Plan (iSAP) ( Appendix A ) describes the planned interim 
analyses that will be solely used for interim decision making by [CONTACT_140993]  (DMC) . If additional analyses are required to supplement the planned 
analyses described in this SAP, they will be identified in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  
This SAP is being written with consideration of the recommendations outlined in the 
International Conference on H armonisation (ICH) E9 Guideline entitled Guidance for Industry: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials and the most recent ICH E3 Guideline entitled Guidance for Industry: Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports.

The primary objective  is, in patients at low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) goal 
while on s tatin therapy, with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at high risk for 
CVD, and hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides [TG] 200* mg/dL and <500 mg/dL 
[2.26 mmol/L and <5.64 mmol/L]), to evaluate the effect of 4 g/day AMR101 on the time 
from randomization to first occurrence of any component of the composite of the following 
major cardiovascular (CV) events:  
 CV death;  
 Nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI),  (including silent MI; electrocardiograms [ECGs] 
will be performed annually for the detection of silent MIs); 
 Nonfatal stroke; 
 Coronary revascularization; or 
 Unst able angina determined to be caused by [CONTACT_816833]/non-invasive testing and requiring emergent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

3.[ADDRESS_1131067] of AMR101 vs. control, in terms of the 
composite endpoint listed above as the primary efficacy endpoint. The study has been planned to accrue a total of 1612 efficacy endpoint events with two planned inter im analyses when 
approximately 967 (60%) and 1290 (80%) of the events have occurred and been adjudicated. The study includes patients with established CVD (CV Risk Category 1) and patients ≥[ADDRESS_1131068] one additional risk factor  for CVD but with CVD not 
established (CV Risk Category 2).  
Sample size calculation was based on assumptions of constant hazard, asymmetric recruitment rate over time and without factoring for dropouts. A risk reduction corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.85 (AMR101 vs. control) is assumed. [ADDRESS_1131069] ratio with approximately 90% power with one -sided alpha -level at 2.5% 
and with two interim analyses.  
The recruitment period is assumed to be approximately 4.2 years with 20% recruitment in the first year, 40% in the second year, 20% in the third year, 19% in the fourth year and the remaining 1% in the last 0.2 years. The expected maximum study duration is estimated at 6.5 years unless the trial is terminated early for e fficacy or safety issues. A one- year event rate of 
5.2% (hazard = 0.053) in the control arm is also assumed. Under these assumptions the number of patients to be enrolled is N = 7990. 
Randomized treatment assignment to either 4 g/day AMR101 or placebo in a  1:1 ratio will be 
provided using the internet via an interactive web response system (IWRS). Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_816899] 1 or 2 (defined in the inclusion criteria of the study protocol), use of ezetimibe, and by [CONTACT_101820] (Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific countries).  
Approximately 70% of randomized patients will be in CV Risk Category 1, a nd approximately 30% of randomized patients will be in CV Risk Category 2. Enrollment of patients within a CV risk categ ory will be stopped when the planned number of patients in 
that risk category is reached or, if the enrollment target is extended beyond 7990 patients (as

enrollment.  
Study drug AMR101 or placebo capsules will be taken daily (with food) as two capsules in 
the morning and two capsules in the evening (twice- per-day dosing regimen). 
The study schedule and assessments to be performed are described in the study protocol. 
 Efficacy Assessments  3.2.1
The primary endpoint and the majority of the secondary and tertiary endpoints are based on 
clinical events related to CVD and mortality. All events oc curring between randomization and 
the study end date (inclusive) will be recorded. All suspected efficacy endpoint events will be 
adjudicated by a Clinical E ndpoints Committee (CEC) based on the criteria detailed in the 
CEC Charter. The CEC members are bli nded to study treatment allocation. For efficacy 
endpoints including CV events, only adjudicated events will be included in the final statistical analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the t ime from randomization to the first occurrence of the 
composite of the following clinical events:  
 CV death;  
 Nonfatal MI (including silent MI; ECGs will be performed annually for the detection 
of silent MIs);  
 Nonfatal stroke; 
 Coronary revascularization;  
 Unstable angina determined to be caused by [CONTACT_816724]/non -
invasive testing and requiring emergent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
The first occurrence of any of these major adverse cardiovascular events during the follow -up 
period of the study will be included in the incidence. 
All deaths casually adjudicated as “undetermined” will be combined with those adjudicated as 
“CV deaths” for the primary analysis. A sensitivity analysis of the CV death category will be 
performed that excludes the “undetermined cause of death” cohort. 
For sil ent MIs, the primary analysis will assume that all silent MIs occurred on the date of the 
first tracing indicative of a silent MI; a second (sensitivity) analysis will assume that all silent 
MIs occurred on the day after the last prior normal ECG; and a third (sensitivity) analysis will 
assume that all silent MIs occurred at the mid -point between the last normal ECG and the 
ECG with the new MI .

8 July  2016  Page 14 of 68  [IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is the time from randomization to the first occurrence of 
the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI (including silent MI), or nonfatal stroke.  
Other secondary efficacy endpoints are time from randomization to the first occurrence of the 
individual or composite endpoints as follows (to be tested in the order listed): 
 Composite of CV death or nonfatal MI (including silent MI); 
 Fatal or nonfatal MI (including silent MI);  
 Non-elective coronary revascularization represented as the composite of emergent or 
urgent classifications; 
 CV death;  
 Unstable angina determined to be caused by [CONTACT_816724]/non -
invasive testing and requiring emergent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; 
 Fatal or nonfatal stroke;  
 Composite of total mortality, nonfatal MI (including silent MI), or nonfatal stroke; 
 Total mortality.  
For the secondary endpoints that count a single event, the time to first occurrence of this type of event will be counted for each patient. For secondary endpoints that are composites of two 
or more types of events, the time to first occurrence of any of the event types included in the composite will be counted for each patient. 
For the secondary endpoints as well as the tertiary endpoints mentioned below, the main 
analysis will combine  all deaths casually  adjudicated as “undetermined” with those 
adjudicated as “CV deaths” and use the date of the first tracing indicative of a silent MI as the onset date for silent MI , similar to the primary efficacy analysis described above. Similarly, 
the sensitivity analyses as described for the primary composite endpoint will also be carried 
out for the secondary and tertiary endpoints. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tertiary Efficacy Endpoints  
The following tertiary endpoints will be evaluated as supporting efficacy analyses. Where  
applicable and unless specified otherwise, endpoint analyses will be conducted as time from 
randomization to the first occurrence of the individual or composite endpoints.

 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  4.
4.1 Determination of Sample Size 
The initial sample size estimation (protocol v1.0) was based on the assumption that the 
primary composite endpoint (time from randomization to the first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI, non- fatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) would be relatively reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 15% with AMR101 from an event rate by 4 years of 20.8% (5.2% per year) in the placebo group (which corresponds to a hazard ratio of 0.85). The updated sample size calculation is based on assumptions of constant hazard, asymmetric recruitment rate over time and without factoring for dropouts. A risk reduction corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.85 (AMR101 vs. control) is assumed. [ADDRESS_1131072] ratio with approximately 90% power with two-sided alpha- level at 5% and with two interim analyses .  
The recruitment period is assumed to be approximately 4.2 years with 20% recruitment in the first year, 40% in the second year, 20% in the third year, 19% in the fourth year and the remaining 1% in the last 0.2 years. The expected maximum study duration is estimated at 6.5 years unless the trial is terminated early for efficacy or safety issues. A one- year event rate of 
5.2% (hazard = 0.053) in the control arm is also assumed. Under these assumptions the number of patients to be enrolled is N = 7990. 
Two interim analyses are planned after approximately 60% (967) and approximately 80% 
(1290) of the primary events have occurred (see iSAP in Section 6.1 [Appendix A] for 
description of the interim analyses). 
Since this is an events -driven trial, the ‘sample size’ is the number of events rather than the 
number of patients. The number of events  that occur depends primarily on three factors: how 
many patients are enrolled, the combined group event rate, and how long the patients are 
followed. Because of the difficulty in predicting the combined event rate, the sponsor will monitor that event rate  as the trial progresses. If the combined event rate is less than 
anticipated, either increasing the number of patients, extending the length of follow -up, or a 
balance of adjusting both factors may be necessary to achieve the sample size of [ADDRESS_1131073] 1 a djudicated, primary event (and appropriately accounting for patients with potential primary events for which the adjudication process is then incomplete) was consistent with projections, then the study could continue toward the protocol -specified target enrollment of 7990 patients.  However, if the number of 
such events appeared less than and inconsistent with projections, the Sponsor would consider (under blinded conditions ) re-calculating the number of patients needed to achieve the target 
  Statistical Analysis Plan

8 July  2016  Page 18 of 68  number of events within the desired timeline or extend the follow -up period.  If the projected 
increase in number of patients was ≤25% of the original 7990 target population, the Sponsor 
could, with documented approval of both the REDUCE -IT Steering Committee and the DMC , 
extend enrollment to the revised target number without need for an additional protocol amendment. Under those conditions, all principal investigators, ethics committees, and 
regulatory authorities associated with the protocol will be promptly notified of the action. If the projected increase in number of patients was more than 25% above the original 7990 target ( i.e. more than 1998 additional patients) a formal protocol amendment would have been 
initiated.  
Consistent with the plan stated above, an analysis and modeling of pooled, blinded primary efficacy endpoint events across the remainder of the trial was performed prior to the projected enrollment of the 7990
th patient.  Based on this analysis, the sample size of 7990 randomized 
patients is with 95% confidence likely to result in the target 1,[ADDRESS_1131074] patient  was randomized. 
4.2 Analysis Sets  
 Intent -to-Treat Population (ITT)  4.2.1
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will include all patients who are randomized via the 
IWRS. All efficacy analyses, including the primary analysis, will be performed on the ITT 
population. Patients will be analy sed according to the randomized treatment . 
 Modified Intent -to-Treat Population (m ITT)  4.2.2
The Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population will include all randomized patients who 
have study drug dispensed after randomization. Groups will be defined based on t he 
randomized treatment.  
 Per Protocol Population (PP)  4.2.3
The Per-Protocol (PP) population will include all mITT patient s without any major protocol 
deviations, and who had ≥80% compliance while on t reatment.  T o be included in the PP 
population the minimum time on therapy is 90 days.   
 Safety Population 4.2.4
All safety analyses will be conducted based on the Safety population, which is defined as all 
randomized patient s. This is the same as the ITT population.

 General Statistical Considerations 4.3.1
All statistical analyses and data summaries are to be generated according to this SAP. Any 
deviations from this SAP will be documented in the CSR. 
All null hypotheses will be defined as no treatment difference. All statistical tests for the 
efficacy outcomes will be performed at the two -sided 5% significance level, unless otherwise 
noted. The iSAP will utilize one -sided testing for efficacy at the 0.025 level for interim 
analyses, the operating characteristics of which are identical to those of a corresponding group 
sequential design with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
Summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_816900]. Data 
will be presented “as -observed”, unless otherwise specified. Continuous data will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics: count (n), number of missing values (n -missing), 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical data will be described using frequencies and percentages, including a category  for missing values  where 
appropriate . Percentages are based on t he number of patients in the analysis set. All 
meaningful patient data collected in the database will be listed. Listings will be sorted by [CONTACT_816901]/site . 
 Missing Data 4.3.[ADDRESS_1131075] day of the month will be used for all end dates. 
Missing AE relationship will be presented as ‘related’ in tables and missing in listings. In 
addition, tables that describe the collected data and that include a ‘missing’ relationship 
category where appropriate will be present ed. Missing AE intensity /severity  will be presented  
in a ‘missing’  category in tables and as missing in listings.   
  Statistical Analysis Plan  
Amarin Pharma, Inc.   AMR -01-01-[ADDRESS_1131076] non -missing measurement obtained 
prior to the dispensing drug, unless otherwise specified. If the baseline value is missing, the 
value obtained at the screening visit will be used as the baseline value. 
Lipid, lipoprotein, and inflammatory marker baseline values will be derived variables. LDL -C 
may b e obtained by [CONTACT_816902]; therefore , the baseline value obtained via 
Preparative Ultracentrifugation will be used, unless this value is missing. If the LDL -C 
Preparative Ultracentrifugation  value is missing, then another LDL -C value will be used, with 
prioritization of values obtained from LDL -C Direct measurements, followed by [CONTACT_31620] -C 
derived by [CONTACT_618657] (only for subjects with TG < 400 mg/dL), and finally 
LDL- C derived using the calculation published by [CONTACT_816903] y investigators (Martin 
2013). For all other lipid, lipoprotein, and inflammatory marker parameters, wherever possible, baseline will be derived as the arithmetic mean of the Visit 2 (Day 0) value and the preceding Visit 1 ( or Visit 1.1) value. If only one  of these values is available, the single 
available value will be used as baseline. 
 Study Day  4.3.4
For purposes of calculating study day , the day of randomization is defined as Day 0 . Study 
Day will be calculated as [date of event – date of randomization + 1 ].
 
 Visit Window s 4.3.5Nominal study visits (days or weeks relative to Baseline) as collected per the protocol 
schedule of events will be used to summarize data. Ranges for study day intervals (“windows”) will not be used to re -assign visit numbers in relation to the start of therapy. If 
there is more than one valid measurement for a selected visit  after the baseline visit, the 
average of the values collected will be used . However, for any safety analyses intended to 
identify outliers  (including, but not limited to, shift tables), the most extreme value  instead of 
the average of the values collected  will be used; and values from all visits (including  
unscheduled measurements) will be  included in these analyses.  
 Multiplicity  4.3.6
There is a si ngle primary efficacy endpoint (a composite of CV death , nonfatal MI , nonfatal 
stroke , coronary revascularization , or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929] ) and  one primary 
comparison (Placebo vs. 4 g /day AMR101) defined in the primary objective. Formal 
  Statistical Analysis Plan  
Amarin Pharma, Inc.   AMR -01-01-0019  
Confidential and Proprietary  
8 July  2016  Page 21 of 68  statistical testing for key and other secondary endpoints will be performed for the final 
analysis , either at the planned completion at 1612 primary events or in case of an early stop 
for efficacy at one of the two interim analyses , and will be carried out in a hierarchical fashion 
if and only if the primary endpoint meets statistical significance. The hierarchy of secondary endpoints is given in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The planned interim analyses are based on a group sequential design with O’Brien -Fleming 
boundaries generated using the Lan -DeMets alpha- spending function at approximately 60% 
and 80% of the targeted 1612 events. The use of the spending- function allows for possible 
deviations from the planned event number at the time of the interim. If the interim analyses 
are carried out exactly at the planned 60% and 80% milestones, then the resulting one -sided 
alpha- levels at each of the two interim analyses and the final analysis are:  
 0.0038 at the 60% milestone (967 events), 
 0.0110 at the 80% milestone (1290 events), and 
 0.0211 at the 100% milestone (1612 events). 
A complete description  of the group sequential design details is described in the iSAP 
(Appendix A) . 
The alpha level for the final analysis either at the planned completion at 1612 primary events or in case of an early stop for efficacy will be obtained from the O’Brien -Fleming  boundaries 
generated using the Lan -DeMets alpha- spending function. If the primary efficacy endpoint 
test described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] meets statistical significanc e at this alpha- level , then the 
testing will be carried out hierarchically for the key secondary and the other secondary endpoints at the same alpha level used for the primary endpoint. All analysis beyond the 
primary or the last endpoint meeting statistic al significance at this alpha -level will be 
considered as exploratory. Further details on the alpha -level to be used for the final analysis 
are given in Section 4.5.  
Since the results from the analysis of the tertiary endpoints are intended to be supportive 
rather than pi[INVESTIGATOR_816702], all tertiary efficacy endpoint analysis  
will be considered exploratory and statistical testing will be carried out at the nominal 5% 
level without adjustment.  
4.4 Interim Analyses 
Two interim analyses are planned for the primary efficacy endpoint using adjudicated events when adjudication of approximately 60% (967 events) and approximately 80% (1290 events) 
of the total number of primary endpoint events planned (1612) is reached. The planned interim analyses are based on a  group -sequential design and are described in the iSAP 
(Appendix A) . 
The interim results of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_816904]. The analyses will 
be performed by [CONTACT_816905]. The unblinded information will not be released to the

under such circumstances, procedures for maintaining confidentiality will be described in a 
written agreement with the DMC.  
If the study is termina ted early following an interim analysis, patients will be notified 
promptly and brought in for their final close -out visit, and the final analyses of efficacy and 
safety will include all data through their final visit. Further details are given in Section  4.5.  
4.5 Final Analysis  Following  an Interim Analysis Early Stop Decision 
If the decision is taken to terminate the study at one of the two planned interim analyses , the 
study will enter the closeou t phase. During this phase, which  extends from the DMC interim 
analysis  meeting until the final database lock, additional adjudicated events may arrive. The 
final analysis, being based on the totality of the evidence, will include these additional events, resulting in an increase in the information fraction (of the pre -specified 1612 events) from 
what the information  was at the time of the interim decision making . The significance level 
for the formal hypothesis testing at the final analysis will then be re computed from the Lan -
DeMets error spending function at the new information fraction while ignoring the look at which the efficacy boundary was crossed for the DMC decision- making purpose ( Whitehead, 
1992). A few e xamples of the recomputed alpha level used  for the final analysis are given in

4.7 Efficacy Analyses 
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  4.7.1
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prim ary Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any 
component of the composite of the following adjudicated clinical events:  
 CV death,  
 Nonfatal MI (including silent MI; ECGs will be performed annually f or the detection 
of silent MIs ), 
 Nonfatal stroke, 
 Coronary revascularization, 
 Unstable angina determined to be caused by [CONTACT_816724]/non -
invasive testing and requiring emergent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
All observed data that are positively adju dicated by [CONTACT_15741], including data after 
discontinuation of study treatment for patients who discontinue study drug prematurely, will 
be included in the primary analysis.   
Suspected endpoint events are adjudicated by [CONTACT_816914]. 
Counts and Kaplan- Meier estimates of the percentage of patients experiencing each type of 
adjudicated event by [CONTACT_90142], along with overall counts for each type, will be 
presented by [CONTACT_273916]. A separate table of the number of events that are ruled out by [CONTACT_816915].  
The event time will be calculated as the (date of first event – date of randomization + 1 day) 
for patients who experience one or more of the primary endpoint events. The following provides detailed considerations for determining the date of event/date of censoring: 
 Patients who do not experience a primary efficacy event prior to the end of the study or withdrawal from the study early without a preceding primary efficacy event will be 
censored at the date of their last visit/phone contact.  
 Patients who die with an adjudicated undetermined cause of death and without a 
preceding endpoint event will be considered to have an adjudicated CV death and this will be included as an event in the primary analysis.

death within [ADDRESS_1131080] visit/phone contact.  
 The primary analysis of silent MI will assume that all silent MIs occurred on the date 
of the first tracing indicative of a silent MI.  
Kaplan -Meier estimates will be used to summarize the time to the first event of the composite 
endpoint. Event probabilities at 6- month intervals and the median time to event (if estimable) 
will be presented. The l og-rank test, stratified by [CONTACT_816916] (CV 
risk category, use of ezetimibe, and geographical region [Westernized, Eastern European, and 
Asia Pacific countries]), will be used to compare the time -to-event between treatment gro ups. 
The two -sided alpha level for the primary analysis will be reduced from 0.05 to account for 
the interim analyses based on a  group sequential design with O’Brien -Fleming boundaries 
generated using the Lan -DeMets alpha -spending function. 
The hazard rati o (HR) comparing the two treatment groups along with a confidence interval 
(CI) adjusted for the interim analyses and p- value will be calculated from a s tratified Cox 
proportional hazards (PH) model with treatment as the only covariate, and stratified by C V 
risk category at baseline, use of ezetimibe at baseline, and geographical region (Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific countries). Kaplan -Meier curves stratified by [CONTACT_816917].  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on t he ITT population. A corresponding sensitivity analysis will be performed using the mITT and PP populations. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Sensitivity, Supportive , and Exploratory Analyses for the Primary 
Efficacy Endpoint 
As a sensitivity analysis, patients who discontinue study drug prematurely will be censored 
for the composite endpoint analysis on the date of drug discontinuation. The primary analysis will be repeated using this censoring rule for the mITT population. 
In the primary analysis, the date of first ECG indicative of a silent MI will be taken as the date 
for that silent MI. The following sensitivity analyses regarding this definition will be carried 
out both on the ITT and mITT populations: 
1. Date of silent MI = Date of last normal ECG + 1 ; and  
2. Date of silent MI = Mid -point between date of last normal ECG and date of first 
indicative ECG.  
In the primary analysis, deaths with undetermined cause and without a preceding primary endpoint event constituent will be regarded as CV deaths. A sensitivity analysis where 
patients are censored for these cases will be carried out both on the ITT and the mITT populations. 
  Statistical Analysis Plan  
Amarin Pharma, Inc.   AMR -01-01-[ADDRESS_1131081] with the counting -process formulation of Andersen and Gill 
(Andersen and Gill, 1982) will be carried out to model the recurrent cardiovascular events. 
Since death is a termi nating event, the modified Wei -Lin-Weissfeld (WLW) method (Wei, 
Lin, and Weissfeld, 1989) for analysis of recurrent events in presence of death proposed by [CONTACT_816918] (Li and Lagakos, 1997) will also be carried out as a supportive analysis. Both 
analys es will be carried out for the ITT and mITT populations. 
As an exploratory and supportive analysis, a stratified Cox proportional hazards model will be constructed for the primary endpoint to evaluate the treatment effect adjusting for important baseline covariates. Stratification variables will include CV risk category at baseline, use of 
ezetimibe at baseline, and geographical region (Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific countries). The model will include treatment and any of the following vari ables that 
are identified by a stepwise selection procedure: 
 Gender;  
 Age at baseline (<65 or ≥65 years); 
 Race (White and non -White); 
 Presence/absence of diabetes at baseline;  
 Baseline LDL -C (by [CONTACT_816756]); 
 Baseline HDL -C (by [CONTACT_816756]); 
 Baseline non -HDL -C (by [CONTACT_816756]); 
 Baseline TG (by [CONTACT_816756]); 
 Baseline hs-CRP (≤3 mg/L and >3 mg/L); 
 Baseline Apo B (by [CONTACT_816756]); 
 Baseline RLP-C (by [CONTACT_816756]); 
 Hopkins calculated LDL- C at baseline (by [CONTACT_816756]);  
 Waist/height ratio  at baseline ; and  
 Waist circumference at baseline. 
The minimum p -value to enter will be 0.05 and selected variables with p < 0.[ADDRESS_1131082] ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and p- value comparing the 
two treatment groups, and the hazard ratio, 95% CI and p- value for each covariate in the final 
model will be  presented.  
 Components of Primary Endpoint  4.7.[ADDRESS_1131083] stratified by [CONTACT_816870], and the 
Cox proportional hazards model including the stratification factors as specified above for the 
primary efficacy endpoint, will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] . Kaplan -Meier curves 
stratified by [CONTACT_816919]. These analyses will be conducted for the ITT, mITT and PP populations. 
Similarly, the rules for determining date of event/date of censoring for the primary efficacy 
endpoint (Section 4.7.1) will be applied to the components of primary endpoints . For the CV 
death endpoint, patients who do not die from CV causes will be censored at death from non-
CV causes or last visit/phone contact  [CONTACT_103234] [IP_ADDRESS]. For all other events 
(nonfatal MI [including silent MI], nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816703]/non- invasive testing), patients who do not experience the event will be censored at 
death or last visit/phone contact, consistent with that described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
In addition, a recurrent event analysis using Andersen -Gill and Li- Lagakos methods will be 
carried out for the individual primary event constituents other than CV death . 
 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  4.7.[ADDRESS_1131084] stratified by 
[CONTACT_816870], and the Cox proportional hazards model including the stratification factors as specified above for the primary efficacy endpoint, will be summarized  by [CONTACT_1570]. Kaplan -Meier curves stratified by [CONTACT_816920]. Similarly, the rules for determining date of event/date of censoring for the primary efficacy endpoint (Section 4.7.1)  will be applied to the secondary endpoints. These 
analyses will be conducted for the ITT population.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Key Secondary E fficacy Endpoint  
If the primary analysis is statistically significant, then the key  secondary efficacy endpoint , 
which is  the time from randomization to the first occurrence of the composite of CV death, 
nonfatal MI (including silent MI), or nonfatal stroke will be tested first.

As an  additional exploratory analysis , the relationship between post -baseline biomarker 
values and treatment  effects with the primary and key secondary composite endpoints will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_816873] (for example, at 4 month, or at 1 year, etc.) as time-

Adjustment for Baseline TG  Level : Following a protocol amendment, dated May 2013, only 
patients with qualifying TG ≥200 mg/dL were enrolled in the study. Prior to this, patients with 
qualifying TG levels a s low as appr oximately 135 mg/dL  were enrolled. In order to account 
and adjust for the fact the follow -up times may be different depending on the baseline TG 
level, a Cox PH model as mentioned above but additionally with baseline TG as a covariate 
will be fitted to the  data at each interim. Diagnostic plots for the PH assumption will be 
evaluated.  
The consistency of the treatment effects in subgroups will be assessed for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. For each subgroup variable, a Cox proportional hazards model with terms for treatment, stratification factors (with the exception of those subgroup variables related to the stratification factors, i.e., CV risk category), subgroup, and treatment -by-
subgroup interaction will be performed. The main treatment effect will not be tested with this model. P -values for testing the interaction terms < 0.[ADDRESS_1131090]  plot.
 
All subgroup analyses will be conducted for the ITT, mITT and PP populations.

 Adverse Events  4.8.1
AEs are recorded from the time the informed consent is signed until study participation is 
complete. Adverse events with onset on or after the date of dispensing study drug for each 
patient will be considered treatment- emergent (TEAEs). This will include any AE with onset 
prior to initiation of study drug and increased severity after the treatment initiation.

8 July  2016  Page 36 of 68  By [CONTACT_376120], serious AEs (SAEs) that are endpoint events will only be recorded for 
the endpoint determination and not captured as SAEs. Following adjudication, if the event is determined to not meet the criteria for an event, the event will be evaluated as an SAE.  
Adverse events will be coded using the most recent available Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version. Coding includes system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). All AEs will be listed by [CONTACT_816923]; these listings will present detailed information concerning adverse events, including the verbatim description, time of onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, and outcome.  
Pre-treatment AEs : 
Pre-treatment -emergent AEs will be defined as any AE that started before the patient’s 
randomization. (An AE that was ongoing at the time of randomization and subsequent ly 
increased in severity is also considered treatment -emergent.) Pre- treatment AEs will be listed 
separately from  TEAEs . 
Treatment -emergent AEs : 
For each patient , the following AEs will be defined as TEAEs: 
 AEs occurring after randomization ; 
 AEs occurring within 30 days after the completion or withdrawal from study; 
 AEs started prior to randomization  but worsened in severity following randomization ; 
 AEs with partial onset dates if the AE stop date is after randomization and the dates do 
not de finitively place the AE start date before randomization ; and  
 AEs with completely missing onset dates.  
The frequency and percentage of patients with any TEAEs will be summarized. TEAEs will 
be presented by [CONTACT_3592]. At each summary level, a patient will b e counted only once for 
each TEAE he/she experiences within that level, regardless of how many occurrences of that TEAE that patient experienced. The percentage of patients having had at least one TEAE at each level will be calculated.  
An overall summary o f patients with at least one TEAE, severe TEAE, related TEAE, SAE, 
related SAE, TEAE leading to discontinuation of study drug, adjudicated as a clinical event, and leading to death will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Tabular summaries by [CONTACT_816924] d term will include all AEs, severe TEAEs, related TEAEs, serious TEAEs (SAEs), 
related SAEs, TEAEs leading to permanent study drug discontinuation, TEAEs that were adjudicated as events, and TEAEs leading to death.  
For the purpose of analysis, TEAEs with a reported relatedness of related, probably related, or possibly related will be characterized as “Related”. AEs assessed as “Not Related” will be classified as not related to study drug. In instances where a patient may have had multiple TEAEs with differ ing levels of severity or relatedness, the most severe or most related event,

analysis, missing AE relationship will be presented as ‘related’ in tables and missing in 
listings. In addition, tables that describe the collected data and that include a ‘missing’ 
relationship category where appropriate will be presented. Missing AE severity will be presented in a ‘missing’ category in tables and as missing in listings.  
Pre-randomization AEs and TEAEs will be listed separately. In addition, listings will be 
provided of SAEs and AEs meeting criteria for adjudication (including whether the event was adjudicated as an endpoint or ruled out). Deaths will be presented in a listing that includes the AE leading to death, demographic data, details of study treatment, and relationship of the AE leading to death to the study drug .

hours. For the purposes of this study, fasting is defined as nothing by [CONTACT_24340] (and 
any essential medications).  
The safety parameters are analyzed by a certified clinical laboratory at screening (Visit 1 or Visit 1.1), Randomization visit (Visit 2; Day 0), Visit 3 (Day 120; ~4 Months) and all other follow- up visits including the last visit: 
 Hematology with complete blood count (CBC), including red blood cell (RBC) count, 
hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), white blood cell (WBC) count, white cell differentials (Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils and Basophils), and platelet count; and  
 Biochemistry panel including total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), total bilirubin, glucose, calcium, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, uric acid, creatine kinase, and HbA1c.  
Clinical laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics . Mean  and 
mean change from baseline values will be presented at each study visit.  C hange from baseline will be calculated as post -baseline measurement minus baseline measurement.  If 
either the baseline or post -baseline value is missing, the observation will not be included in 
the change from baseline summary.  
Each laboratory result will be classified as low (L), normal (N), and high (H) at each visit according to the laboratory -supplied normal range. The shift from baseline will be presented 
for each post -baseline visit and overall post -baseline visits .  If multiple measurements  for a 
test parameter are available for a post -baseline patient -visit, the most extreme value will be 
included in the shift table . For shift from baseline to overall post -baseline visits, values from 
all visits (including unscheduled measurements) will be included.  The chemistry shift table 
will include fasting lipid parameters.  (The continuous lipid values are presented as part of the efficacy analysis.)

indicators of hepatic disorders (e.g., ALT or AST  increases >3  × ULN , total bilirubin 
increases of ≥2 × ULN ) will be summarized separately and compared between treatment 
groups. 
 Vital Signs and Patient  Measurements  4.8.4Vital signs include systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mmHg), heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], 
and body temperature. Blood pressure should be measured for all patients at screening (Visit 
1/ Visit 1.1), Randomization visit (Visit 2; Day 0) and all other follow -up visits including the 
last visit (end of the study. The end of the study will be at the time of the last patient’s last visit of the follow -up period of the study).

This interim Statistical Analysis Plan (iSAP ) has been developed based on the Protocol 
AMR -01-01- 0019 (Amendment #2 Final  Version 3.0 da ted: 8 July 2016 and the 
Statistical Analysis P lan ( SAP), Final Version 1.0 dated: 8 July 2016). This iSAP 
describes analysis methods  to be used by [CONTACT_64741] D ata Monitoring C ommittee 
(DMC ) and the independent statistic al team  for carrying out unblinded efficacy and 
safety analysis at the two planned  interim analyse s (IA) during  a gro up sequential trial. 
Unblinded data  will only be available to the DMC and the independent statistical team 
supporting the interim analyses. Unblinded information will not be released to the 
Sponsor before the completion of the study unless extraordinary circumstances arise and, 
under such circumstances, procedures for maintaining confidentiality will be described in a written agreement with the DMC .  The analyse s described in this iSAP are only to be 
used for interim decision making for early stop or continuation of the trial to the planned completion and not to be used for supporting efficacy and safety claims. A separate SAP has been developed that describes  the final analysis that would support such claims. 
Clinical trial REDUCE -IT (protocol AMR -01-01-0019) is a multi -center, prospective, 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study to evaluate the effect 
of AMR101 (icosapent ethyl [ethyl- EPA], 4 g/day) vs. control in patients at low density 
lipoprotein- cholesterol  (LDL-C) goal while on statin therapy with established 
cardiovascular disease ( CVD) or at high risk for CVD. The primary efficacy endpoint 
will be evaluated in  terms of the time from randomization to first occurrence of the 
composite major cardiovascular ( CV) event that includes: 
1. CV death;  
2. Nonfatal myocardial infarction ( MI), including silent MI ; 
3. Nonfatal stroke; 
4. Coronary revascularization; or 
5. Unstable angina determined to be caused by [CONTACT_816724]/non-invasive testing and requiring emergent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
In this document, components 1- 3 above are referred to as “hard” major adverse 
cardiovascular events ( MACE ) components while components 4 and 5 are referred to as 
“other” MACE components 
This is an event driven trial, i.e. targeting a fixed number of major CV events listed above 
and follows a group sequential design ( GSD) with two planned interim analyses at 
approximately 60% and 80% of th e targeted major CV events.  
  Interim Statistical Analysis Plan  
Amarin Pharma  Inc. Protocol AMR -01-01-[ADDRESS_1131099] of AMR101 vs. control, in terms of the 
composite endpoint listed above as the primary efficacy endpoint. The study has been planned to accrue a total of 1612 e fficacy endpoint events with two planned inter im 
analyses when approximately 967 (60%) and 1290 (80%) of the events have occurred and been adjudicated. The study includes patients with established CVD (CV Risk Category -
1) and patient ≥ [ADDRESS_1131100] one additional risk factor for CVD 
but with CVD not established (CV Risk Category- 2). 
Sample size calculation was based on assumptions of constant hazard, asymmetric recruitment rate over time and without factoring for dropouts. A risk reduction corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.85 ( AMR101 vs. control) is assumed. [ADDRESS_1131101] this HR with approximately 90% power with one -
sided alpha- level at 2.5% and with two interim analyses.  
The recruitment period is assumed to be approximately 4.2 years with 20% recruitment in the first year, 40% in the second year, 20% in the third year, 19% in the fourth year and the remaining 1% in the last 0.2 years. The expected maximum study duration is estimated at 6.5 years unless the trial is terminated early for effica cy or safety issues. A 
one-year event rate of 5.2% (hazard = 0.053) in the control arm is also assumed. Under 
these assumptions the number of patients to be enrolled is N=7990. 
2.1 Group Sequential Design  Details  
The planned interim analyses are based on a GSD with O’Brien -Fleming boundaries 
generated using the Lan -DeMets (DeMets  1994) alpha- spending function. The use of the 
spending- function allows for possible deviations from the planned event number at the 
time of the IA . If the interim analyses are carried out exactly at the planned 60% and 80% 
milestones, then the resulting one -sided alpha -levels and boundaries based on a  Z -test 
and corresponding HR for each of the two interim analyses and the final analysis are 
given in Table 1. In case of a deviation, as an example, if the first interim is carried out 
after 58% of the events and the second at 80% then the one -sided alpha -levels will be 
0.0032 and 0.009 respectively  with corresponding upper bounds on HRs being 0.837 and 
0.881 respectively. For reference, Table 2 and Table 3 provide examples of possible 
deviation, if the planned 60% interim (Table 1) occurs at 50% ( Table 2) or 55% (Table 3) 
of primary events with completed adjudication.

Described here is an analysis plan consisting of a sequence of analyses to be performed at 
each IA time point, in order to aid decision making regarding  whether the trial should 
continue or be terminated. However, the entire sequence of analyses described below in Section s 4.1 through 4.3, and the predictive power (PP) calculation in Section  5, will be 
performed and presented to the DMC  irrespective of the result of the singular formal 
hypothesis test. Figure  1 in Section 6 provides a graphical display of the hierarchical 
sequence of analyses and serves as a guide for the DMC  in making its recommendation to 
either continue or stop the trial.  
4.1 Safety Analysis 
Safety analyses will  be carried at the interim analyses based on the safety population. 
All adverse events ( AEs) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_816928]. P -
values from tests of independence using Fisher’s exact test or the Chi -square test will be 
provided for flagging purpose. No multiplicity adjustment is needed here. The definition of AEs and their classification is defined in the SAP for the final analysis.  
Summary measures at each visit and change from baseline will be presented for other safety parameters: el ectrocardiogram, vital signs including systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, hematology and biochemistry clinical laboratory parameters. Summary tables will be accompanied by [CONTACT_816929]. 
The safety analyses could result i n three possible outcomes as shown in Figure  1. 
 The DMC  has safety concerns that warrant immediate termination of the trial;  
 The DMC  has safety concerns that warrant continuing the trial for additional 
safety follow -up regardless of the efficacy outcomes; or 
 The DMC  has no safety concerns currently warranting action. 
4.[ADDRESS_1131102] results will only be used for the purpose of DMC ’s decision 
making. The final efficacy anal ysis is described in Sections 4.[ADDRESS_1131103] occurrence of any component of the 
composite of the following adjudicated events

2. Nonfatal MI (including silent MI; electrocardiograms [ ECGs ] will be performed 
annually for the detection of silent MIs); 
3. Nonfatal stroke; 
4. Coronary revascularization; or 
5. Unstable angina determined to be caused by [CONTACT_816833]/non-invasive testing and requiring emergent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
In this document, components 1- 3 above are referred to as “hard” MACE components 
while components 4 and 5 are referred to as “other” MACE components. 
All suspected events will be adjudicated in a blinded manner by [CONTACT_816930] ( CEC ) and only event s that are confirmed by [CONTACT_816931].  
The following are detailed considerations for determining the date of event/date of 
censoring for the primary analysis:  
 Patients who withdraw from the study  early  and do not experience any of the 
primary efficacy event s prior to withdrawal will be considered censored at the last 
visit/phone contact [CONTACT_816932]. 
 Patients who do not  experience any of the primary efficacy event s prior to the 
interim cutoff date but are still in the trial will be considered censored at the date 
of their last visit/phone contact [CONTACT_816876].  
 Patients who die with an adjudicated undetermined cause of death and without a 
preceding endpoint event will be considered to have an adjudicated CV death and 
this will be included as an event in the primary analysis.  
 In view of the 90- day monitoring period for CV events, patients who have a non-
CV death within [ADDRESS_1131104] visit/phone contact.  
 The primary analysis of silent MI will assume that all silent MIs occurre d on the 
date of the first tracing indicative of a silent MI.  
In order to test the hypothesis of superiority of the AMR101 group vs. the control group, an unblinded analysis will consist of fitting Kaplan -Meier ( K-M ) curves to the time to 
composite event a nd using a stratified log -rank test to test for the difference. The one -
sided alpha -level corresponding to the IA will be used as the significance level for the 
log-rank test here. Thus, for example, if the first interim is conducted after 60% of the 
event s then the above test will meet statistical significance if the one -sided str atified log -
rank test p -value <0.[ADDRESS_1131105]: 
1. Geographical location (Western, Eastern European and Asia Pacific);  
2. CV risk group: Patients w ith established CVD (CV Risk Category -1) and Patients 
≥ [ADDRESS_1131106] one additional risk factor for CVD but 
CVD not established (CV Risk Category-2); and, 
3. Use of ezetimibe.  
All stratified analyses mentioned in this document will be based on the above three 
variables.  
4.2.2 Supportive Analyses for Primary Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS] Estimation of H azard Ratio 
In addition to the stratified log -rank test described in  Section  4.2.[ADDRESS_1131107], we will estimate the corresponding HR (point estimate 
and confidence interval) between the AMR101 and the control groups for the primary composite event. Si nce this is not part of a formal hypothesis test, a 95% two -sided 
confidence interval will be presented. Estimation will be carried out using a stratified Cox proportional hazards ( PH) model fitted to the time to composite event, stratified by [CONTACT_816933] 4.2.1, and with treatment as the only covariate. Diagnostic 
plots for the proportional hazards assumption will be evaluated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adjustment for B aseline Triglyceride (TG) L evel 
Following a protocol amendment, dated May 2013, only patients with a qualifying TG 
level  ≥200 mg/dL  were enrolled in the study. Prior to this , patients with qualifying TG 
levels as low as approximately 135 mg /dL were permitted to enroll. In order to account 
and adjust for the fact the follow -up times may be different depending on the baseline TG 
level, a Cox PH model as mentioned above but additionally with baseline TG as a 
covariate will be fitted to the data  at each interim. Diagnostic plots for the proportional 
hazards assumption will be evaluated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adjustments for Unadjudicated E vents  
A data cut -off date prior to the IA will be decided on b y the sponsors and the DMC . 
Certain events may remain unadjudicated a t this point. Summary measures by [CONTACT_816934]’ classification (primary or otherwise) of these unadjudicated events will be presented to the DMC . Additionally, adjusted survival curves (Cook 2000 ) 
and corresponding log-rank test and hazard estimation will be provided. 
Cook’s methodology (Cook 2000) is based on a ssuming that the probability that a 
reported event will be adjudicated as primary event constituent depends only on i ts 
investigator -reported classification and is unrelated to t reatment, time of event or the 
subject’s prior event history. Under these assumptions, the results of adjudication for all events for which the adjudication is complete are used to estimate the probability of an unadjudicated event to be adjudicated as a p rimary event constituent. Once these 
  Interim Statistical Analysis Plan  
Amarin Pharma  Inc. Protocol AMR -01-01-0019 
Confidential and Proprietary  
8 July  2016  Page 13 of 24 probabilities are estimated, the data with only confirmed events (as used for the primary 
efficacy analysis above) will be augmented with the unadjudicated events data while allocating  the events according to the estima ted probabilities. Then a valid analysis using 
the K -M estimator, the log-rank statistic , and the Cox PH model can be performed using 
the augmented data. As an alternative, the estimated probabilities can be used as weights in the generalized K -M estimator , the generalized log -rank test and in the weighted Cox 
PH model. Technical details are available in (Cook 2000, Cook 2004) . The estimates of 
the survival probabilities and regression parameters are shown to be unbiased in Cook 
and Kosorok (Cook 2004). 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1131108] Ratio for Composite “Hard” MACE and Individual Components of 
the Composite Primary  Endpoint  
Hazard ratio s for AMR101 vs. control will be estimated separately for the 3-component 
“hard” MACE composite endpoint as well as for each of the “hard” and the  “other” 
MACE individual components using a stratified Cox PH model with treatment as the 
only covariate. 95% confidence intervals will be used. 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1131109] functions for each stratum while assuming that the stratum -
wise HRs between the AMR101 and the control groups are the same. Here we consider 
an analysis where HRs are estimated indiv idually for each marginal stratum level of each 
of the three stratification factors. Thus we estimate the HRs with 95% confidence intervals for each stratum within:  
1. Each of the three geographical regions; 
2. For each of the two CV risk groups; and 
3. For each of the two groups based on ezetimibe use. 
Thus seven HR  estimates will be obtained,  each from a stratified Cox PH model with 
treatment as the only covariate. Stratification in this case  will be based on the other two 
stratification variables. For marginal stratum , where the cell -size is small, an unstratified 
analysis will be carried out as an alternative.  
4.2.5 Progress in the Control Group  
One of the inclusion criteria of this trial is that the patients be on a stable dose of statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe) prior to randomization and following randomization. In view of the importance of the statin- alone group response being consistent with 
expectations, two methods of comparing the control group in terms of the primary composite event endpoint and in te rms of  the composite of CV death, non- fatal MI and 
nonfatal stroke (hard MACE) with historical data will be employed. The historical data will be obtained from different studies having at least one of the two CV -risk populations 
(Section  4.2.1)  on statin therapy. 
First, the annualized (time -averaged) control group event rates will be compared to that 
from the historical data stratified by [CONTACT_30215] -risk gro up. This will be done both in terms of the 
  Interim Statistical Analysis Plan

8 July  2016  Page 14 of 24 composite primary endpoint as well as its five individual components, whenever the 
required information is available from the historical data. Pooling of historical data from different studies will not be carried out. 
Second, cumulative incidence (%) of the primary composite endpoint and that of the composite “hard” MACE endpoint will be plotted for the control group arm alongside the corresponding cumulative incidence (%) plots that are available from peer -reviewed 
literature on individual historical studies. Variations in primary endpoint definitions will be allowed and pooling of data from individual studies will not be carried out. 
At minimum, the following articles (studies) will be considered for the historica l data:  
1. Intensive Blood Glucose and Vascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 
Diabetes, the ADVANCE collaborative group ( Patel 2008) 
2. Effects of Combination Lipid Therapy in Type [ADDRESS_1131110] study group (Ginsberg 2010)  
3. Intensive versus Moderate Lipid Lowering with Statins after Acute Coronary Syndromes (Cannon 2004) 
4. Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_816705] ( Bhatt 2006) 
5. Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with atorvastatin in type 2 diabetes in the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS): multicentre  
randomis ed placebo -controlled trial ( Colhoun 2004) 
6. Impact of Triglyceride Levels Beyond Low -Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol 
After Acute Coronary Syndrome in the PROVE IT -TIMI 22 Trial ( M. Miller  et al. 
[2008]) 
7. Angiotensin-Converting– Enzyme Inhibition in Stable Coronary Artery Disease, 
The PEACE trial investigators (Braunwald  2004) 
8. High -Dose Atorvastatin vs . Usual -Dose Simvastatin for Secondary Prevention 
After  Myocardial Infarction, The IDEAL Study: A Randomized Controlled Trial 
(Pedersen  2005) 
Other studies completed before the time of the interim analyses may also be included. A detailed explanation for inclusion/exclusion of studies will be provided in the interim data analysis report.  
In addition to the above analyses comparing the entire REDUCE -IT control group 
responses (by [CONTACT_30215] -risk category and overall) to historical outcomes data, other potential 
analyses may employ case- matched subsets from the control group in REDUCE -IT for 
comparison to populations with similar attributes from published historical data.  
4.[ADDRESS_1131111] the future of the trial, given the interim data, we consider 
calculation of conditional power ( CP) and predictive power ( PP). While the CP provides 
a frequentist means to this, the PP is based on Bayesian calculations where one starts with a prior belief on the effect of the treatment which is then updated once the data is available. Through these calculations one can study the impact of departures from design 
assumptions, such as lags in efficacy response, loss to follow -up, or differences in 
stratum- wise HRs, into predicting the probability of success given the interim data. In 
this section we describe how PP may be incorporate d into the interim decision -making 
for possibly overruling an early efficacy -stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_816706].  
Figure  1 shows that stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_816707]101. However, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_816708], it may be worthwhile to continue the trial if the results at the final 
analysis are expected to provide even stronger evidence of efficacy, for example, in terms of one or more of the three individual components of the “hard” MACE composite endpoint meeting statistical significance.  This situation could be expected if the 
predictive power calculated at the interim for an individual hard MACE component is sufficiently high (>90%). 
In the remainder of this section we summarize how CP and PP are computed. Additional 
technical details are provided in the Appendix. In the  context of this iSAP, HR for the 
composite event and that for its five individual components will be used to estimate the effect of AMR101 compared to control. We describe the PP calculation process in terms of the composite event, calculations for the individual components are similar. 
The hazard functions for the two arms are assumed to be pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] -wise constant, i.e., 
constant over a small time interval but allowed to change from one time interval to the 
next. A prior distribution for each of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] -wise constant hazards are assumed. For 
this we propose to use the Gamma -process priors (Nieto -Barajas 2002 ). Priors reflecting 
different HRs between the two treatment arms will be considered in order to assess the 
sensitivity of the predictive power to prior assumptions. Other scenarios such as lag in treatment response and different stratum -wise HRs will also be considered. 
Once the unblinded interim data is obtained, the posterior (updated prior) distribution of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] -wise constant hazards will be obtained. A Monte -Carlo simulation will follow 
where at each run, hazard functions will be sampled for each of the treatment groups using the posterior distributions. These hazard functions will then be used to generate the part of the data that is yet to be obs erved. The interim data and the generated data will 
then be considered as a “proxy” for the final data and will be used to test the primary efficacy hypothesis. Using the proxy data if the hypothesis is rejected the decision value will be 1, otherwise 0. T his generation of the missing or incomplete data will be carried 
out several times for each set of sampled hazard functions. The average of the binary decision variable over all these runs is then the Bayesian CP. Averaging the Bayesian CP 
  Interim Statistical Analysis Plan  
Amarin Pharma  Inc. Protocol AMR -01-01-[ADDRESS_1131112] functions sampled from the posterior is then the Bayesian PP. 
Details of this computa tion are given in the Section 9 (Appendix). 
At interim analyses, th e DMC  may conduct/request additional analyses at their discretion, 
such as conditional power analyses, as estimations of possible power at study completion.

At each IA, one of the following recommendations may be given by [CONTACT_1363] : 
1. Continue trial as planned; 
2. Stop for success; or 
3. Stop for safety issues. 
In Figure  1, we outline the hierarchy of analysis results that is intended to be followed for 
interim decision -making by [CONTACT_1363] . This sequence of analyses is discussed in Section  4 
and Section 5. It consists of the safety analysis (Section 4.1), Efficacy Analy sis 
(Section  4.2) which includes one formal hypothesis  test, and computation of Predictive 
Power (Section 5). Descriptive analysis of Lipid and Lipoprotein parameters (Section 
4.3) may additionally be used for interim decision -making at the discretion of the DMC .

INTERIM ANALYSIS  
If the decision is taken to terminate the study at one of the two planned interim analyses , 
the study will enter the closeout phase. During this phase that extends from the interim 
analysis  meeting of DMC until the final database lock, additional adjudicated events may 
arrive. The final analysis, being based on the totality of the evidence, will include these 
additional events, resulting in an increase in the information fraction (of the pre -specified 
1612 events) from what the information was at the time of the IA. The significance level 
for the formal hypothesis testing  at the final analysis will then be recomputed from the 
Lan-DeMets error spending function at the new information fraction. Stage -wise adjusted 
p-values and confidence intervals consistent with group sequential boundaries computed 
using the Lan- DeMets spen ding function (T siatis  1984, Kim 1987) will be calculated.

9.1 Predictive Probability Calculation  
The PP calculation proposed here involves assuming (nonparametric) priors for the two 
hazard functions corresponding to the two treatment groups. 
Denote the data f
or the 𝑖-th subject as 𝑦𝑖= (𝑡𝑖,𝛿𝑖,𝑧𝑖), where 𝑡𝑖 is the time of the 
occurrence of composite event, 𝛿i is the censoring indicator and 𝑧𝑖 is the set of 
stratification and other covariates including the randomized treatment regimen. At the time of the interim analysis, some patients w ould already have had the primary event of 
interest and some would have completed the planned follow -up (𝑦
𝑜𝑜𝑜), while  some 
patients enrolled prior to the interim would not have experienced the event of interest and 
would not have completed their follow -up (𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜1). Data for patients to be enrolled after 
the interim in case the trial continues is denoted as 𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜2. Also let 𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜= (𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜1,𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜2). 
This notation can be generalized to more than one interim analysis. 
The PP will be 
calculated following the methods outlined in Schmidli, Bretz, and Racine -
Poon (2007). The main difference in our approach is that we base our decision-making 
(𝑅) on the log -rank test where as in Schmidli, Bretz, and Racine -Poon (2007) it is  based 
on the test for proportion of events in each treatment arm. 
𝑃𝑃=∫𝐶𝑃(𝜃 ∣ 𝑦𝑜𝑜𝑜)𝑝(𝜃 ∣ (𝑦𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜1))𝑑𝜃, 
where, 𝜃= (ℎ1,ℎ2) the hazard functions for the two groups, 𝑝(𝜃 ∣ 𝑦𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜1) is the 
posterior distribution of 𝜃 given the interim data and 𝐶𝑃 is the conditional 
power given 
by 
𝐶𝑃(𝜃 ∣ 𝑦obs) =∫𝑅(𝑦obs,𝑦miss)𝑝(𝑦miss  ∣ 𝜃,𝑦𝑜𝑜𝑜)𝑑𝑦miss, 
where, 𝑅(𝑦) defines a de
cision function based on the log -rank test with 𝑅(𝑦) = [ADDRESS_1131115] functions using 
Gamma processes (Nieto -Barajas [2002]) . Using such priors facilitates modeling of the 
hazard function in terms of pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] -wise constant hazards, 𝜆k in the time interval 
(𝜏𝑘−1,𝜏𝑘]. Thus the hazard function is given by 
ℎ(𝑡) =�𝜆𝑘𝐾
𝑘=1𝐼(𝜏𝑘−1 ,𝜏𝑘](𝑡). 
Gamma -priors are imposed on each 𝜆k. Further, the dependency between 𝜆k−1 and 𝜆k is 
modeled using a latent -variable which is conditionally independent of {𝜆𝑘} given the 
  Interim Statistical Analysis Plan  
Amarin Pharma  Inc. Protocol AMR -01-01-[ADDRESS_1131116] 
function ( Nieto -Barajas [2002]) . 
For the REDUCE -IT trial, Gamma -priors can be constructed using data from other recent 
similar trials.  
Once the posterior distributions are obtained for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] -wise components for the two 
hazard functions, the posterior is sampled several times: 𝜃(1),𝜃(2), … ,𝜃(𝑀). For each 
𝜃(k), several samples 𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜(1),𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜(2), … ,𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜(𝑁) are drawn from the likelihood 
𝑝(𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜 ∣ 𝜃(𝑘)). Then the CP is calculated at 𝜃(k) as 
𝐶𝑃(𝜃(𝑘)  ∣ 𝑦𝑜𝑜𝑜) =1
𝑁�𝑅𝑁
𝑗=1(𝑦𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑜𝑜(𝑗)). 
Next the Predictive Power is calculated as  
𝑃𝑃=1
𝑀�𝐶𝑀
𝑖=1𝑃(𝜃(𝑖)  ∣ 𝑦𝑜𝑜𝑜).

 OTHER SENSITIVITY, S UPPORTIVE AND EXPLOR ATORY ANALYSES 
FOR THE PRIMARY EFFI CACY ENDPOINT  
This section relates  to Section [IP_ADDRESS] of version 1 of the SAP dated 08 July 2016 . 
Time -to-event analyses as done for the primary analysis will be carried out at 1 -year and 2 -year 
landmarks  for the  intent -to-treat (ITT) Population . For each landmark, the log -rank test, 
stratified by [CONTACT_816916] ( cardiovascular [ CV] risk category, use of 
ezetimibe, and geographical region [Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific 
countries]), will be u sed to compare the time -to-event between treatment groups. Similarly , 
hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be determined using Cox proportional hazards 
modelling. Patients without events prior to the landmark time will be censored.  
 
For the recu rrent CV events analyses based on 5 -component Major Adverse Cardiovascular 
Events ( MACE ) (CV death, non -fatal myocardial infarction [ MI], non -fatal stroke, unstable 
angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or coronary revascularization) , in addition to the Anders on 
and Gill and the Li and Lagakos methods  specified in the SAP dated 08 July 2016 , the total CV 
event counts will be analyzed using a Negative Binomial Model ( Rogers 2012 , Rogers 2014 , 
and Claggett  2018 ).  It will be implemented using SAS Proc Genmod with  a log link function, 
log exposure time as offset , and treatment group and randomization strata as factors.  
 
As additional sensitivity analysis for the primary composite endpoint  will be carried out, 
namely, an on -treatment analysis which includes primary event onset up to [ADDRESS_1131131]  2018 Page 7 of 13  
 ANALYSIS OF SECONDAR Y EFFICACY ENDPOINTS  
This section relates  to Section 4.7.3 of version 1 of the SAP dated 08 July 2016 . 
As done for the primary analysis, time -to-event analyses will be carried out at 1 -year and 2 -
year landmarks for the key secondary endpoints  for the ITT Population . 
 ANALYSIS OF TERTIARY  ENDPOINTS  
This section relates  to Section 4.7.4 of version 1 of the SAP dated 08 July 2016 . 
The following clinical events  that are positively adjudicated by [CONTACT_816939] ( CEC ) will be analyzed as  tertiary endpoint s for the ITT Population : 
• Composite of total mortality, or new congestive heart failure (CHF)  
• Composite of CV death, or new CHF  
• Sudden c ardiac death  
• Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) 
• Atrial fibrillation , or atrial flutter  
 
These tertiary endpoints will be analysed similarly as for the primary composite endpoint.  
In addition , the following will be analysed as tertiary endpoints  for the ITT Population:  
• Relationship between on -treatment high-sensitivity C -reactive protein ( hsCRP ) and the 
primary and key secondary endpoints  
• Relationship  between on -treatment serum eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and the primary 
and key secondary endpoints  
 
To assess the relationship between on -treatment hsCRP  and the primary and key secondary 
endpoints , subgroup analyses will be carried out  as done for the IT T population  for patients 
grouped according to values greater or equal to  or less than 2  mg/d L at baseline and at 2 years.  
To assess the relationship between on -treatment serum EPA and the primary and key secondary 
endpoints , Kaplan -Meier (KM) curves will be produced for AMR101 treated patients grouped 
into tertiles  based on their values at year 1  and will be compared with the placebo -treated 
patients .  
 EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS  OF SUBGROUPS  
This section relates  to Section 4.7.5 of version 1 of the SAP dated 08 July 2016 . 
The following will be added to the subgroup analyses:  
• Baseline Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ) value (<6.5%, ≥6.5%)  
  SAP Addendum  
Amarin Pharma  Inc.  AMR -01-01-[ADDRESS_1131132]  2018 Page 8 of 13  • Baseline PAD   
• Baseline triglyceride ( TG) levels  ≥ 150 mg/dL  with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL -C) levels  ≤ 40 mg/dL  for males and ≤ 50 mg/dL  for females  
Subgroup analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be performed as described 
for the primary endpoint. For each subgroup, Kaplan -Meier estimates, the log -rank test 
stratified by [CONTACT_513460] f actors used at randomization (except where the subgroup is a 
stratification factor), and hazard ratios ( HRs) and confidence intervals ( CIs) from the Cox 
proportional hazards model as specified for the primary efficacy endpoint, will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_3227].  
 ADVERSE EVENTS  
This section relates  to Section 4.8.1 of version 1 of the SAP dated 08 July 2016 . 
In addition to the treatment -emergent adverse events analyses specif ied in the SAP dated 08 Jul 
2016 , the following analyses  will be performed :  
• All adverse events ( AEs) (serious and non -serious)  
o Treatment -emergent adverse event ( TEAE ) by [CONTACT_816940] ( HLGT ) 
o TEAE by [CONTACT_202069] ( HLT ) 
o TEAE by [CONTACT_9313] ( SOC ), HLGT, HLT, and preferred term ( PT) (4-
level table)  
• All serious AEs ( SAEs) 
o Treatment emergent SAE by [CONTACT_816941]  
o Treatment emergent SAE by [CONTACT_25050]  
o Treatment emergent SAE by [CONTACT_2946], HLGT, HLT, and PT (4 -level table)  
 CLINICAL LABORATORY EVALUATION  
This section relates  to Section 4.8.2 of version 1 of the SAP dated 08 July 2016 . 
The criteria  for potentially clinically significant  (PCS) laboratory values are provided in Table 
[ADDRESS_1131133] -baseline measurement. Number (%) of patients with 
any post -baseline PCS laboratory values will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. A listing of

be included.  
 
 
  SAP Addendum  
Amarin Pharma  Inc.  AMR -01-01-[ADDRESS_1131134]  2018 Page 9 of 13  Drug -Induced Liver Injury (DILI ) 
Potential DILI cases will be investigated through the following analyses:  
• A graph of distribution of peak values of alanine a minotransferase (ALT ) versus peak 
values of total bilirubin (TBL) during the treatment period will be presented, using a 
logarithmic scale. In the graph, for each patient, the peak TBL times the Upper Limit of 
Normal (ULN) will be plotted against the peak ALT times the ULN, wh ere the peak 
TBL and peak ALT may or may not happen on the same day of liver testing. The graph 
will be divided into [ADDRESS_1131135] for TBL. The upper right quadrant will 
be referred to as the potential Hy’s Law quadrant, including potentially DILI cases . 
• A similar graph will be plotted  with respect to aspartate a minotransferase (AST ). 
• The individual patient profile of liver functi on tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase  
[ALP] and TBL ) over time will be provided through a graph for all patients with peak 
value of ALT >[ADDRESS_1131136] and peak value of TBL >[ADDRESS_1131137] during the treatment period . 
• Number (%) of patients will be provided for the fo llowing :  
o ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_1131138] >[ADDRESS_1131139] and TBL >[ADDRESS_1131140] >[ADDRESS_1131141] and TBL >[ADDRESS_1131142], and ALP < [ADDRESS_1131143] -baseline endpoint value categories  
as defined in Table 3 of Appendix A . The definitions for potentially clinically significant 
treatment -emergent values are defined  in Table 4 of Appendix A . 
Number (%) of patients with any post -baseline PCS vital sign  values will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570]. A listing of patient s who meet the threshold criteria will be provided .

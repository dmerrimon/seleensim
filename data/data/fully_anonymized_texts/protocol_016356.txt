91.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
1.2.1 Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplasm characterized by [CONTACT_239908], affecting nearly 20,000 
people annually.[1]  End-organ damage resulting from this disorder includes 
hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and lytic bone lesions.5  Myeloma remains 
incurable, with a median survival of 3-4 years in the [LOCATION_002], although newer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_239825].[2-4]  Importantly, two recent studies have 
proven that all cases of MM are preceded by a premalignant state, monoclonal 
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering multiple myeloma 
(SMM), although at this time the biological mechanism of this progression is not 
understood.[5, 6]  Currently, clinicians do not have access to any established biological 
markers that reliably predict progression to myeloma in patients with MGUS.  This study 
is designed to better understand these premalignant disorders and their progression to 
MM. 
MGUS is a premalignant plasma cell proliferative disorder that is characterized by 
[CONTACT_239909] (M-protein) < 3 g/dL and bone marrow plasma 
cells < 10% in the absence of any other plasma cell disorder.[7]  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_239826] 3.2% in patients older than 50 years; these 
patients have a 1% annual risk of progression to MM.[8, 9]  However, risk factors of M-
protein ≥ 1.5 g/dL, non-IgG M-protein, and abnormal serum free-light chain ratio are 
known to confer a higher rate of progression (58% at 20 years).[10] Similar to MGUS, 
SMM is a precursor condition to MM defined by [CONTACT_239905] M-protein ≥  
3.0 g/dL or bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 10%.  Its risk of progression is higher than that 
of MGUS, estimated to be an average of 10% annually.[11]  SMM can be risk stratified 
into categories using Mayo Clinic risk criteria[12] and Spanish PETHEMA[13] risk 
criteria in addition to the high-risk criteria set forward by [CONTACT_239910], Landgren, Mateos 
[14].  At 5 years, risk of progression to MM for high risk SMM patients, using the above 
risk models is 72-76%.  Median time to progression for high risk SMM is less than [ADDRESS_291219] of care for SMM is close follow-up without treatment until 
symptomatic MM develops. Using melphalan-prednisone in SMM, early treatment has 
not been found to delay progression to active disease or improve overall survival [ 15]. 
The first randomized phase III study using novel drugs (lenalidomide/dexamethasone vs. 
surveillance) in SMM was presented by [CONTACT_239911] 2009 at the 
annual ASH meeting [16]. In May 2011, an intention to treat (ITT), interim analysis 
(n=58) presented at the International Myeloma Workshop in Paris [17] showed the 
following: 7% stringent complete remission (sCR), 7% CR, 10% very good partial 
remission (VGPR) and 57% partial remission (PR). After a median of 7 (range 1-21) 
cycles of lenalidomide maintenance, the sCR increased to 13%. In the treatment arm, 15 
(25%) patients had progressive disease (median follow-up 22 months). In the surveillance 
arm, 28 (46%) patients progressed to active MM. Median time to progression (TTP) from 
inclusion was 25 months for the surveillance arm versus median not reached in the 
treatment arm (p<0.05). 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/[ADDRESS_291220] been found to play a critical role in protein turnover and 
degradation, thereby [CONTACT_239912], signal 
transduction, apoptosis, and stress responses.  The 26S proteasome complex consists of 
the 20S barrel–like core and 19S regulating component.  The 20S proteasome has three 
main catalytic domains that contribute to protein breakdown:  chymotryptic-like activity 
site, tryptic-like activity site, and caspase-like activity site [18].  Inhibiting proteasomes 
in malignant cells lead to buildup of ubiquinated proteins, resulting in eventual cell death.  
Such inhibitor effects likely extend beyond just a simple over-accumulation of cell waste.  
Rather, proteasome inhibitors also exert direct effects on the myeloma microenvironment 
and enable neoplastic cells to “re-direct” cell proliferation/apoptotic signaling while 
overcoming drug resistance mechanisms.         
Bortezomib is a dipeptide boronate reversible inhibitor of the chymotryptic domain of the 
26S proteasome. In combination with other agents, bortezomib demonstrates a potent 
anti-myeloma effect in initial treatment of transplant and non-transplant candidates, as 
well as in relapsed/refractory disease settings [19, 20].  A recent phase I/II study shows 
promising efficacy of the novel combination: bortezomib, lenalidomide, and 
dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, with 74% of subjects 
achieving very good partial response (VGPR) or better [21].   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_239827], bortezomib and others pose certain clinical 
challenges.  Bortezomib drug toxicity is common with side effects including neuropathy, 
GI distress (diarrhea), myelosuppression (in particular thrombocytopenia) and herpes 
zoster re-activation.  Bortezomib associated peripheral neuropathy can be experienced in 
up to 33% (Grade 1 and 2) and <18% (Grade 3 and 4) newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma patients [22].  In the aforementioned phase I/II study, with combination 
bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone, 80% of treated patients experienced 
sensory neuropathy all grades [ 21].  In addition, as increasing numbers of patients are 
treated with novel agents, drug resistance and refractoriness seems to present a significant 
dilemma.  Myeloma patients refractory or resistant to bortezomib and at least one IMID 
(lenalidomide or thalidomide) demonstrate median overall survival and event free 
survival of 6 months and 1 month, respectively [23].  
1.2.3 Investigational Drug Carfilzomib
Carfilzomib is a tetrapeptide ketoepoxide-based irreversible inhibitor that forms a 
covalent bond with N-terminal threonine residue of the chymotrypsin domain.  Compared 
to bortezomib, carfilzomib demonstrates equal potency but greater selectivity for the 
chymotrypsin activity site over the tryptic and caspase domains.  Also, carfilzomib is less 
reactive to non-proteasome proteases compared to bortezomib, likely contributing to 
lower levels of neuropathy and myelosuppression [24-26].  In vitro models suggest 
carfilzomib has activity against bortezomib resistant myeloma cell lines [25].  
Carfilzomib can also work synergistically with dexamethasone to enhance tumor cell 
death [25].  A number of phase I and phase II studies are currently investigating 
carfilzomib toxicity and efficacy in multiple myeloma.  One such phase Ib/II trial is 
examining combination therapy with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and low dose 
dexamethasone in refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma patients.  Based on this ongoing 
study, no MTD of carfilzomib was identified in the dose escalation portion of the study 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/[ADDRESS_291221] dose cohort received. Based on data from an interim analysis including 12 
evaluable newly diagnosed MM patients (who received up to 8 cycles of carfilzomib, 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone), 83% achieved VGPR.  Among 19 patients evaluable 
for toxicity, less than 1% patients experienced grade [ADDRESS_291222] been 4 cases of Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy (PML) possibly linked to Carfilzomib. 
1.2.4 Proposed Study Investigation with Correlative Studies
Given carfilzomib’s potent anti-myeloma activity and lack of peripheral neuropathy, we 
propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_239828] (Cycles 1-8 carfilzomib, 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone) in high-risk SMM patients followed by [CONTACT_239913] (for 12 cycles). Proposed correlative studies include gene 
expression profiling on CD 138 + pre- and post- carfilzomib plasma cells, identification 
of potential biomarkers (blood, urine, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026]), proteasome activity and 
ubiquination assays, and effects on downstream signaling targets.  
Patients will also undergo evaluation for minimal residual disease at regular interval time 
points, using multi-parametric flow cytometry, FDG PET-CT, Diffusion weighted MRI 
(DW-MRI) and detection of clonality using heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin 
rearrangement. Current response criteria in MM are often limited in predicting clinical 
response and duration of response, and minimal residual disease (MRD) use in MM is 
still under current investigation.  Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_239829]-parametric flow cytometry has prognostic value in the post-autologous stem cell 
transplantation setting, and patients achieving negative MRD flow status compared to 
those with residual positive MRD flow status had longer OS (median not reached vs. 89 
months, p = 0.002). 22   Other techniques, such as, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of Ig 
heavy chain (IGH) rearrangements and light chain genes have also been employed in 
evaluating for MRD and found to have prognostic significance in showing prolonged PFS 
after intensive therapy.[ADDRESS_291223] negative status (≤10-5 sensitivity) is an important endpoint that is 
associated with improved direct clinical benefit, both in terms of PFS and OS [27, 28]. 
Furthermore, in the updated [ADDRESS_291224] negative CR at 10-6 to 10-5 sensitivity are formal 
response categories signifying “deep” responses. There is limited published data on MRD 
status as surrogate marker in the smoldering myeloma setting.
FDG-PET CT has been valuable at localizing intramedullary and extramedullary disease 
in MM.  FDG uptake is able to distinguish between active lesions and chronic disease, 
scar tissue, necrotic tissue, radiation changes, and other benign disease.  The sensitivity 
of FDG-PET in detecting myelomatous involvement is approximately 85%, and its 
specificity is approximately 90%.[ADDRESS_291225] the destructive effects of myeloma on trabecular and 
cortical bone rather than disease within the bone marrow space, sensitivity and capability 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
12as a restaging tool are inherently limited. [29]  Myeloma infiltrates within bone marrow 
can be observed on CT if they lie within the marrow spaces adjacent to fatty bone 
marrow. However, in trabecular bone spaces (ie vertebral bodies), myeloma infiltrates are 
difficult to evaluate given factors including the trabeculae, degenerative changes, benign 
lesions, and osteoporosis. In contrast, MRI allows direct imaging of the bone marrow 
given its superb sensitivity, soft-tissue contrast, and early detection of focal myeloma 
lesions. Although PET/CT can also detect myeloma lesions, MRI is more sensitive 
especially with newer techniques, i.e. DW-MRI, which have shown a sensitivity of 77% 
compared to 47% for PET/CT. [30] Current whole-body MRI protocols can incorporate 
DW-MRI sequences that are sensitive to cellular density and viability and are important 
for disease detection and monitoring. Another benefit of DW-MRI sequences are that 
they are quick to perform (~30-45 minutes) and interpret. Finally, the relationship of 
apparent diffusion coefficient values with cell density has the potential to assess response 
to treatment and response heterogeneity prior to changes in lesion size. [ 31, 32] The 
recent MY-RADS recommendations were published in an attempt to promote 
standardization and decrease variations in the acquisition, interpretation, and reporting of 
whole-body MRI and allow better response assessments across cancer centers. MY-
RADS recommendations do require validation within clinical trials, including 
assessments of reproducibility and therefore we will be guided by [CONTACT_48990]’s 
recommendations especially in regard to MRI data acquisition and analysis protocols. 
[29]
Incorporating such techniques into prospective clinical trials may have a role in 
evaluating response to therapy.

1.2.5 Continuation of Lenalidomide
Since the initiation of the protocol new data has been published regarding the efficacy 
and safety of extended dosing with lenalidomide in multiple myeloma patients.  Three 
double blind randomized control trials were published in the same May 2012 issue of 
NEJM showing that patients receiving extended dosing with lenalidomide (10-15 mg) 
after induction type regimens have a significant progression free survival benefit in the 
lenalidomide therapy arms[33-35].  Two studies (McCarthy et al. and Attal et al.) were 
conducted after autologous HSCT and one study (Palumbo et al.) assessed transplant 
ineligible patients after induction therapy with melphalan, lenalidomide and prednisone.  
Importantly, McCarthy and colleagues showed an overall survival benefit in patients 
receiving lenalidomide compared to placebo (15% vs. 23%, p = 0.03)[34].  A small 
increased risk of secondary primary malignancies (SPM) was noted in the lenalidomide 
groups compared to the placebo groups in all three trials with a cumulative incidence of 
SPMs 7-8% in the lenalidomide arms of the three studies [36].  However, it should be 
noted that such a risk has been well known and established in multiple myeloma patients 
receiving alkylator therapy, such as melphalan[37].  All three of the aforementioned 
randomized trials used lenalidomide after melphalan exposure, a significant and notable 
difference between our trial (12-C-0107) and theirs.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_239831], post ad hoc analysis for all three trials with second malignancies 
being scored as “events” still showed a significant event free survival benefit for 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
13lenalidomide arms compared to placebo[33-35].
In a recent meta-analysis presented by [CONTACT_239914]. at ASCO 2013[36] including over 
3000 patients reporting SPM cumulative incidence from randomized phase III trials 
comparing Len vs. No Len treatments, the cumulative incidence rates of hematologic 
SPMs at 36 months was 1.4% Len vs. 0.4% No Len (HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.15-12.62, p = 
0.029) and solid SPMs at 36 months was 2.6% Len vs. 2.9 % No Len (HR 1.1, 95% CI 
0.62-2.00, p = 0.72).  In a subset analysis, investigators reviewed specific treatment 
regimens.  Cumulative incidence of hematologic SPMs at 36 months were consistently 
higher in regimens following lenalidomide + melphalan 1.8% vs. lenalidomide + 
cyclophosphamide 0.3% vs. lenalidomide alone 0.3% vs. melphalan alone 0.4% (HR 
3.8, 2.11-6.86, p<0.001).  Unfortunately, the meta-analysis did not account for duration 
of lenalidomide therapy.  However, it does seem to imply there is an increased risk of 
SPM in patients exposed to both melphalan and lenalidomide agents.  Our study does 
not have melphalan exposure. Therefore, extrapolating cumulative SPM incidence (7-
8% in lenalidomide arm) from the published randomized lenalidomide maintenance 
trials[33-35] would likely be overestimating incidence in our population given the lack 
of melphalan exposure in our trial.  Recently, colleagues from the Mayo Clinic 
published long-term results of their experience with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.  
They report a SPM incidence of 6.6% in a regimen that does not include melphalan.  
Furthermore, recent data show that the risk of SPM is inherently associated with plasma 
cell disorders independent of therapy. For example, MGUS patients have an increased 
risk of AML/MDS, which is the most common SPM reported in multiple myeloma 
patients[37].  
Currently no direct study allows us to accurately estimate anticipated SPM incidence, 
however, based on prior studies, recent meta-analysis, and lack of melphalan exposure with 
lenalidomide, we would anticipate an incidence range of 5.2-8% with a median follow-up 
period of [ADDRESS_291226] with these recent publications, lack of alkylator exposure and a similar study 
design to the phase III Spanish PETHEMA Quiredex trial, we increased lenalidomide 10 
mg extended dosing from the initially proposed 1 year to 2 years in patients that maintain 
their current clinical response and do not show signs of progression as outlined in Section 
6.3 or reasons for removal from protocol therapy listed in Section 3.5. 
1.2.6 Patient Reported Outcome/Quality of Life:  PROMIS
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a health-
related patient reported outcome (PRO) quality of life measurement instrument that was 
developed by [CONTACT_4289]/NCI to standardize patient-reported outcomes for national use by 
[CONTACT_136376]. Two versions of PROMIS are available to researchers: computer-
adaptive tests (CATs) and short forms.[38-43] The short forms are brief, static 
instruments that have demonstrated similar reliability to the longer, dynamic CATs, 
which provide precise measures for studying populations with widely varied responses 
and longitudinal self-report data. Each short form includes [ADDRESS_291227] 7 days on a Likert type scale and takes less than 5 
minutes each to complete; collectively we anticipate the questionnaires chosen for this 
study to take approximately 20 minutes in total.

Version Date:  01/01/[ADDRESS_291228] been validated 
for adults (>18) with a variety of health conditions. Results of PRO for patients with 
RRMM treated with the carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone regimen have been 
published before; however, will be explored additionally in this study.[44] The most 
important difference in the prior study was the patient population was relapsed/refractory. 
In the current study, we hope to gain insight into PROs in a relatively healthy population 
who otherwise would not be treated for smoldering myeloma outside of a clinical trial. 
Given that the standard of care for smoldering MM is observation, it is imperative to 
evaluate the effect of treatment on PROs.
NOTE: As of February 1, 2021 PROMIS surveys are no longer completed.

2.1.3 Recruitment Strategy
Participant sources will include NIH patient populations and outside physician referrals.  Of 
note, our outside physician referral network has a high representation of minorities. 
This protocol may also be abstracted into a plain language announcement and posted on NIH 
websites and on NIH social media platforms.
In addition, we will work with specialists from the NIH Clinical Center Office of Patient 
Recruitment to develop study-specific public service announcements (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, 
etc.) and informational fliers to be used for recruitment activities.  All information to be posted 
or distributed publicly will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval in advance of use. 
Investigators may also take part in online and in-person patient support groups and social media 
forums where patients gather for networking, general support and information about their 
disease. These groups and forums may also serve as indirect recruitment referral resources (e.g., 
investigators may provide information/links to publicly available resources for more information 
on clinical trials to which a patient may self-refer).
2.[ADDRESS_291235] has signed a consent include the 
following: 
Email, written, in person or telephone communications with prospective subjects 
Review of existing medical records to include H&P, laboratory studies, etc.  
Review of existing MRI, x-ray, or CT images
Review of existing photographs or videos
Review of existing pathology specimens/reports from a specimen obtained for diagnostic 
purposes
A waiver of consent for these activities has been requested in section 12.5.1.
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
192.2.2 Screening activities performed after a consent for screening has been signed
The following activities will be performed only after the patient has signed the screening consent 
for this study or the consent for study 01C0129 (provided the procedure is permitted on that 
study) on which screening activities may also be performed. Assessments performed at outside 
facilities or on another NIH protocol within the timeframes below may also be used to determine 
eligibility once a patient has signed the consent.
A complete history and physical examination with documentation of measurable disease and 
assessment of performance status using the ECOG scale must be performed prior to study entry.
The following studies and laboratory tests will be completed 4 weeks prior to study entry, unless 
otherwise noted:
CBC with differential and reticulocyte count 
Acute Care (sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2, glucose, BUN, creatinine), Mineral 
(serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium and albumin) and Hepatic (alkaline phosphatase, 
ALT, AST, total and direct bilirubin) Panels, and CrCl calculation 
Uric acid, LDH, and Beta-2 Microglobulin 
Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation to assess for presence and 
quantity of monoclonal protein (M-protein) 
Random urine sample for protein electrophoresis (UPEP) and immunofixation to assess 
for monoclonal protein in the urine (Bence-Jones proteinuria). Collect a 24 hour urine 
sample if necessary for confirmation of Smoldering Multiple Myeloma diagnosis [i.e. if 
patient’s serum monoclonal protein is not measurable (< 1.0 g/dl)].  
Serum free light-chain studies
Quantitative immunoglobulins
Viral serologies:  Hepatitis B surface antigen and Anti Hepatitis C (HCV) antibody. If 
Anti HCV is positive, will follow with HCV RNA PCR 
If the patient does not meet Mayo Clinic criteria or the criteria set forth by [CONTACT_239910], 
Landgren, Mateos for high-risk SMM, but he/she has evidence of immunoparesis, the 
patient will have to undergo a bone marrow core biopsy and/or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_239833]-risk disease as defined by [CONTACT_239916]. If a bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_239834], then the sample can be processed for baseline 
assays (see APPENDIX C :  Bone Marrow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_237399], Sorting and Storage) to 
minimize the number of bone marrow biopsies
Serum or urine pregnancy test in women of child-bearing potential. 
12-lead EKG
A skeletal survey of the axial and appendicular skeleton will be performed.  (NOTE:  A 
skeletal survey does not have to be repeated if performed at the NIH within 3 months of 
screening.) 
A spi[INVESTIGATOR_184112] (cervical/thoracic/lumbar) is required prior to study entry to exclude ≥  2 
lytic lesions; if patient has had an MRI performed at an outside facility, one performed at

patients will still be required to have medically supervised pregnancy testing as 
outlined in APPENDIX B; and may have the pregnancy test performed by [CONTACT_239928]. In these cases, the local physician will submit the results to NIH 
Clinical Center for review. Upon receipt of negative pregnancy test result and 
completion of phone counseling per the REMS® program, NIH Clinical physician 
will prescribe a 28 day supply of lenalidomide to be sent to the patient by [CONTACT_239927].
The duration for extended dosing was determined based on the study design from the 
Phase III trial Quiredex trial of lenalidomide/dexamethasone followed by 
[CONTACT_239929]. observation in high-risk SMM patients conducted by 
[CONTACT_239930].  In this study, the treatment arm received [ADDRESS_291242] randomized phase III trials investigating lenalidomide maintenance were 
published in 2012 with median follow-up periods ranging from 30 months to 45 
months.  Two out of three of these studies continue lenalidomide maintenance until 
progression with no planned end date for lenalidomide maintenance29,30.

263.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS
NOTE:  If patients require lenalidomide dose reductions and experience delays in drug 
administration (e.g., due to pharmacy not having the correct dosage form and/or time 
required to get the correct/adjusted dose supply to the patient), these administrative delays 
will not be considered a reportable protocol deviation.  Furthermore, appointments and 
treatments missed by [CONTACT_239931] a reportable protocol deviation. Patients 
may miss up to 15% of lenalidomide doses. All efforts will be made to attaining and 
delivering medications to the patient expeditiously.

treatment termination. In patients whose measurable disease is best determined by [CONTACT_239933]- Jones protein quantification, a 24 hour 
UPEP will be performed at baseline, day 1 of each cycle 1-8, and day 1 (or within 7 days prior to day 1) of every third cycle during extension 
phase I and II. Otherwise, 24-hr UPEP Bence-Jones quantification will be estimated from random UPEP specimens performed at baseline, 
day 1 of each cycle 1-8, and day 1 (or within 7 days prior to day 1) of every third cycle during extension phase[46].  
m. FDG-PET scan will be performed on patients at baseline, during cycles 1-8 if patient achieves CR and/or at the end of cycle 8 if no CR is 
achieved, during cycles 9-20 (extended dosing phase I) if patient achieves CR and/or at the end of cycle 20 if no CR is achieved, and during 
cycles 21-32 (extended dosing phase II) if CR is achieved or at treatment termination. FDG-PET scan can be performed +/- 21 days of

4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES AND CONSIDERATIONS
4.1 TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME
4.1.1 Hydration and Fluid Monitoring Guidelines
a. Oral hydration:  All subjects must be well hydrated (i.e., volume replete).  Begin oral 
hydration equal to approximately 30 mL/kg/day (~6–8 cups of liquid per day), starting 
[ADDRESS_291262] dose of carfilzomib. 
b. IV hydration:  Adequate hydration is required prior to dosing in Cycle 1, especially for 
patients at high risk of tumor lysis syndrome or renal toxicity. The recommended 
hydration includes both oral fluids ([ADDRESS_291263] 48 hours before Cycle 1, Day 1) 
and intravenous fluids (250 ml to 500 ml of appropriate intravenous fluid prior to each 
dose in Cycle 1). If needed, given an additional 250 to 500ml following carfilzomib 
administration. Continue oral and/or intravenous hydration, as needed, in subsequent 
cycles. Monitor patients for evidence of volume overload and adjust hydration to 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
38individual patient needs, especially in patients with or at risk for cardiac failure.  Total 
volume will be determined at the discretion of clinician and volume status of patient. 
c. In subjects considered to be still at risk for TLS at completion of Cycle 1, hydration 
should be continued into subsequent cycles if clinically indicated.  
4.1.2 Laboratory Monitoring
a. Appropriate chemistries, including creatinine, and complete blood counts (CBC) with 
platelet count should be obtained and reviewed prior to carfilzomib dosing.  Results of 
laboratory studies must be reviewed and deemed acceptable prior to administering the 
carfilzomib dose.  
b. Subjects with laboratory abnormalities consistent with lysis of tumor cells (e.g., serum 
creatinine ≥ 50% increase, LDH ≥ 2-fold increase, uric acid ≥  50% increase, phosphate ≥ 
50% increase, potassium ≥ 30% increase, calcium ≥ 20% decrease) prior to dosing should 
not receive the scheduled dose
4.1.3 Clinical Monitoring  
a. Signs and symptoms indicative of TLS, such as fevers, chills/rigors, dyspnea, nausea, 
vomiting, muscle tetany, weakness, or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], seizures, and decreased urine output.
b. Patients will be admitted to the inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239853] [ADDRESS_291264] be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) through 
the normal process within 24 hours of the clinical site becoming aware of the event.
4.1.5 Optional medication for high risk TLS patients:
a. Allopurinol is optional and will be prescribed at the Investigator’s discretion.  These 
subjects may receive allopurinol 300 mg PO BID (Cycle 1 Day -2, Day -1), continuing 
for 2 days after Cycle 1 Day 1 (total of 4 days), then reduce dose to 300 mg PO QD, 
continuing through Day 17 of Cycle 1.  Allopurinol dose should be adjusted according to 
the package insert.  Subjects who do not tolerate allopurinol should be discussed with the 
Lead Principal Investigator.
4.2 TRANSFUSIONS/GROWTH F ACTORS
Subjects may receive RBC or platelet transfusions if clinically indicated.  
Colony-stimulating factors may be used if neutropenia occurs but should not be given 
prophylactically.  
4.3 ANTI-C OAGULATION
Oral Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 mg or 325 mg or suitable alternative anti-coagulation for thrombotic prophylaxis 
every day for the duration of their participation in the study. Anti-Xa levels will need to be 
followed in those patients with eGFR<30 ml/min and receiving enoxaparin. In general, 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
39temporarily holding of prophylactic or treatment doses (for venous thrombo-embolism) anti-
coagulation with either aspi[INVESTIGATOR_239854]-procedurally (e.g., for bone marrow biopsies) 
is not required. However, in rare cases, the clinician may hold when clinically indicated.
4.4 HSV AND VSV PROPHYLAXIS
Oral Valacyclovir of 500 mg daily or oral Acyclovir of 800 mg BID throughout all cycles in 
which carfilzomib is given.  
4.5 ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS
Patients at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_239855].  Risk assessment 
will be performed by [CONTACT_239938].  For instance, diabetic patients or patients taking 
chronic steroids will be offered Bactrim prophylaxis (or similar agents) to avoid risk of PCP 
infection.     
4.6 PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LE[LOCATION_006]OENCEPHALOPATHY (PML)
Patients on this study will be monitored for any new or worsening neurologic, cognitive or 
behavioral signs and symptoms that may be suggestive of PML as part of the differential 
diagnosis of central nervous system disorders. If PML is suspected, withhold administration of 
carfilzomib; subjects should be promptly referred to a specialist and appropriate diagnostic 
testing should be initiated. Carfilzomib should be discontinued if PML diagnosis is confirmed.
4.7 HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) REACTIVATION
Active HBV is an exclusion criterion for this study. However, some patients who are carriers for 
HBV will be allowed on study. For subjects who are carriers of HBV, prophylaxis with antivirals 
should be considered. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with carfilzomib should be closely 
monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout and following the end of 
treatment with carfilzomib. For subjects with active HBV reactivation, carfilzomib should be 
withheld until infection is adequately controlled.

42GEP profiling targeted exome sequencing, and VDJ sequencing for MRD 
assessment: Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_239863] 8 cycles of induction or CR, after 20 and 32 cycles of treatment 
and at annual follow-up milestones where BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_239864] (if the 
samples were collected from the patients.)  At baseline: CD138+ plasma 
cells will be purified from bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_239865]. Baseline 
CD138+ cells will be sent for VDJ sequencing and to University of Miami 
([CONTACT_239968]) for targeted/whole exome sequencing and molecular 
expression analyses (depending on resources) in a coded, linked manner.  At 
subsequent time points, once patient is in CR, plasma cells will not be

The correlative NGS assays to be performed will be dependent on final agreement 
in investigating mutually important questions of interest with our collaborators.  
These include but are not limited to all or some of the following but are all 
optional:
1.T-cell receptor repertoire (immunoseq): More recently research in the 
literature has shown that patients most likely to benefit from immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_239869]-tumor T cell clonality. Lenalidomide is 
an immunomodulatory and therefore it is important to analyze this along with 
immune subsets below in SMM. NGS DNAseq will be used to analyze the 
VDJ sequence of T-cells to determine clonality. Input source may be PBMC 
or whole blood and approximately 2 ug of input gDNA will be needed which 
will amount to a whole blood collection of two 10 ml EDTA tubes. Collection 
time points include the following milestones, baseline, C8 or CR, 1 year and 2 
years.
2.Germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and copy number variations 
(CNV) DNAseq: Whole exome or genome sequencing will be performed on 
peripheral blood to determine baseline germline SNPs and CNVs. Whole 
blood (one 10 mL EDTA tube) sample will be collected at baseline for 
germline DNA extraction. This DNA will be used to analyze and compare 
germline vs. somatic/tumor genetic alterations based on sequence data. 
Furthermore, germline normal polymorphic variation will be analyzed as 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) to determine whether certain normal 
variations predispose patients with treated SMM to progress to biochemical or 
overt symptomatic disease. Additionally, these germline variations may be 
analyzed for association with treatment related adverse events.
3.ctDNA: Targeted DNAseq will be performed on ctDNA for assessment of 
minimal residual disease (MRD). In addition to the VDJ targeted commercial 
assay to determine presence of the malignant clone, the library will also 
include other known recurrent genetic aberrations. Approximately 45% of 
myeloma patients have hyperdiploidy of one of the odd numbered 
chromosomes, the other 45% have specific translocations/deletions, well 
characterized, including translocations of 6;14, 11;14, 4;14, 14;16, 16;18, 17p 
del, and cMYC.  Therefore, the assay will focus on both VDJ as with other 
hematologic malignancies and recurrent genetic alterations similar to the 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
44approach used in solid malignancies. Blood collection will involve two 10 mL 
EDTA tubes, alternatively, Streck tubes may be used if processing of the 
sample will be delayed by [CONTACT_726] 2 hours.
4.Gene expression profiling: RNAseq will be performed on CD138+ myeloma 
cells and correlated with DNAseq results. Additionally, peripheral 
blood/PBMC will analyzed for immune related signatures. One 10 mL EDTA 
tube will be used for this purpose.
vi. Immune subset analysis
Bone marrow and PBMCs will be processed, stored, and assessed by [CONTACT_239940] (DTB) Lab using multiparameter flow 
cytometry for immune subsets including but not necessarily limited to Tregs, 
MDSC subsets, monocyte subsets, CD8+ T-cells and CD4+Foxp3- T-cells. 
Assessment will include functional markers, i.e. PD-1, Tim-3, CTLA-4 and/or 
CD40. 
PBMC collection of specimen(s): Two 8-10 ml EDTA (purple top) or BD 
Vacutainer Cell Preparation Tubes (CPB; blue and black tiger top) will be 
collected from each patient. Immediately after collection, mix the blood 
sample by [CONTACT_239941]. The date and exact time of each 
blood draw should be recorded on the tube.
Bone marrow collection of specimens: 1 ml of bone marrow will be collected 
from each patient

5.1.3 Imaging – FDG-PET/CT
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule
FDG-PET scan will be performed on patients at baseline, during cycles 1-[ADDRESS_291271] at progression. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures
Prior to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging, the subject will have fasted and not received any sugar 
containing substance (i.e., glucose, sucrose, dextrose) for 4-[ADDRESS_291272] from 
the CC or another accredited lab performed on the day of the scan or the day before the scan.  
18F-FDG, [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose is an FDA approved radiopharmaceutical.  Immediately 
prior to injection, the subject’s blood glucose level will be evaluated via finger stick.  Non-
diabetic subjects with fasting blood glucose levels above 150 mg/dl may be rescheduled at the 
discretion of the PI.  Subjects will be asked to refrain from excessive physical exertion for the 24 
hours prior to injection.  
Patients will report to the NCI clinic on the day of the F-18 PET/CT scan and peripheral venous 
access will be obtained (most commonly via IV in the antecubital fossa).  The 18F-FDG injection 
procedure will be injected and be followed by a ~20 ml saline (sodium chloride IV infusion 0.9% 
w/v) flush over a period of ~[ADDRESS_291273]-
administration for any reaction (e.g., bleeding, hematoma, redness, or infection). 
Whole body (vertex to toes) static PET/CT imaging will be performed beginning at 
approximately 1-hour post injection per PET/CT standard operating procedures.  The patient will 
be instructed to maintain good hydration in order to reduce the radiation dose. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Location of Scanners to be used for imaging 
5.1.4  Patients may be imaged either in the Molecular Imaging Program (MIP) or Nuclear 
Medicine to allow flexibility in scheduling; whenever possible, the same scanner used at 
baseline should be used in follow-up.  Imaging – DW-MRI
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
47For newly enrolled patients, whole body DW-MRI scans will be performed on patients at 
baseline, cycle 4 and if and when patient reaches a PR, CR, and/or PD, and at the end of 
treatment. During follow-up period, scans may be done at any time point at the discretion of the 
investigator.  We plan to obtain DW-MRI scans on current patients, for whom we may not have 
a baseline DW-MRI scan, at the same timepoints, as applicable. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures
DW-MRI exploits differences in the diffusion of water in various tissues to internal physiology. 
The image contrast in reflects the difference in rate of diffusion between tissues. All attempts 
will be made to perform the DW-MRI scans on the same day as PET/CTs, but is not mandatory. 
For DW-MRI, no external contrast will be used and fasting is not required. Standard clinical 
operating procedures will be used for image collection. DW-MRI evaluations will be considered 
purely exploratory.
[IP_ADDRESS] Results
Patients will be given the results of the DW-MRI scans.  But given the exploratory and research 
nature of the scans, these results will not be used for clinical decision-making purposes.
5.1.5 Patient Reported Outcomes
The PROMIS Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) QoL 
instrument was administered to all consenting patients who speak English or Spanish until 
February 1, 2021. This instrument was administered at baseline; at the start of every cycle 
(cycles 2-8 only); the start of every 3rd cycle (cycles 9-32 only); every 3-6 months thereafter 
during the follow-up phase; and at the time a patient was taken off treatment. Since the measures 
have not been validated in other languages, participation in this portion of the study was limited 
to subjects who speak either English or Spanish. Further, although patients were not given the 
option to “opt out” of completing PROs, it was not considered a reportable deviation when PROs 
were not completed or were missed for any reason as this is an exploratory endpoint. 
PROMIS is funded by [CONTACT_239944], precise, valid, and responsive measures of health and well–being in clinical 
trial patients. The short forms that were implemented in this study involved questions in the 
domains of physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to 
participate in social roles and activities, pain interference, pain intensity, and cognitive function. 
A computer tablet-based application also exists which can utilize computer adaptive tests (CAT) 
which can lower patient burden; that is, adapting the template 37 questions presented on the 
paper short forms based on patient response. The questionnaires took no more than 20 minutes to 
complete.  
As feasible, the PROMIS data may be captured based on this CAT PROMIS tablet application; 
alternatively, the paper short forms presented in the appendix will be used. Data was secured on 
the tablet based on 2 passwords. When results are ready for analysis, they will be exported in 
excel format and submitted for storage in C3D or Labmatrix, as appropriate. 
 NOTE: As of February 1, 2021 PROMIS surveys are no longer completed.

6 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION 
6.1 DATA COLLECTION
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_62482] a 21 CFR Part 11-compliant data 
capture system provided by [CONTACT_62550], consistency and 
timeliness. The principal investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted 
data manager will assist with the data management efforts. Primary and final analyzed data will 
have identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant.
All adverse events (AEs), including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory 
evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of the 
event.  
Document AEs from the first study intervention from Study Day [ADDRESS_291276] intervention, only adverse events which are 
serious and related to the study intervention need to be recorded. 
An abnormal laboratory value will be recorded in the database as an AE only if the laboratory 
abnormality is characterized by [CONTACT_39132]:
Results in discontinuation from the study
Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention
Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Is judged by [CONTACT_52374]
If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome.
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according to HHS, FDA regulations and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable. 
Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breach in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, this will be reported expeditiously per 
requirements in section 7.2.1.
6.1.1 Long-term follow-up data collection
When patients enter the long-term follow-up period, the following data will be collected:
adverse events related to Carfilzomib

Cycles 21, 24, 27, [ADDRESS_291281] yearly.
6.3.1 Disease Parameters
Measurable is defined as any of the following: serum M-protein is ≥  1 g/dL or 
"measurable" urine M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_179409] ≥ 200 mg/24 hours or serum kappa or lambda FREE light 
chain of 10 mg/dL along with an abnormal kappa to lambda free light chain ratio.
The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to 
therapy in patients who have oligo-secretory disease. When using this assay, it is 
important to note that the FLC levels vary considerably with changes in renal function 
and do not solely represent monoclonal elevations. Thus, both the level of the involved 
and the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the involved/uninvolved ratio or involved-
uninvolved difference) should be considered in assessing response. The serum FLC assay 
should be used in assessing response only if the baseline serum and/or urine M proteins 
are not “measurable” by [CONTACT_97106] (serum M protein ≥ 1gm/dL and/or urine M 
protein ≥  200 mg/24), and the baseline level of the involved FLC is ≥ 10mg/dL and 
clonal (abnormal ratio). Patients included on the study on the basis of FLC alone (i.e., no 
measurable serum/urine) should be the only ones who are evaluated using FLC response 
criteria. The others should follow usual criteria and ignore FLC results.
In order to be classified as a hematologic response, confirmation of serum monoclonal 
protein, serum immunoglobulin free light chain (when primary determinant of response) 
and urine monoclonal protein (when primary determinant of response) results must be 
made by [CONTACT_99964].
Caution must be exercised to avoid rating progression or relapse on the basis of variation 
of radiological technique alone. Compression fracture does not exclude continued 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
53response and may not indicate progression. When progression is based on skeletal disease 
alone, it should be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_239878].
Appearance of monoclonal or oligoclonal bands that are different from original isotype 
may not be defined as “relapse from CR”. Oftentimes, such bands may indicate 
fluctuations in immunological parameters that are not reflective of MM disease. In 
these situations, immunofixation and electrophoresis will be interpreted by [CONTACT_239950] “relapse”[47, 48].
Random urine specimens will be performed day 1 of each cycle (cycles 1-8) and day 1 
(or within 7 days prior to day 1) of every third cycle (cycles 9-32).  24-hr UPEPs will be 
performed to confirm and document “CR” response (once serum and random have 
become negative for monoclonal protein and immunofixation).  In patients whose 
measurable disease is best determined by [CONTACT_239951], a 
24 hr UPEP will be performed at baseline, day 1 of each cycle 1-8, and day 1 (or within 7 
days prior to day 1) of every third cycle during extension phase I and II.  Otherwise, 24-
hr UPEP Bence-Jones quantification will be estimated from random UPEP specimens 
performed at baseline, day 1 of each cycle 1-8, and day 1 (or within 7 days prior to day 1) 
of every third cycle during extension phase[46].
As of amendment L (version date 05/17/2018), primary endpoint will be MRD (-) CR 
rate, therefore per the discretion of the investigator, patients without measurable disease 
may also be enrolled.
6.3.2 Response Criteria adapted from International Myeloma Working Group Criteria for 
Multiple Myeloma[49] and addition of nCR category[21, 50] 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Response Criteria
MRD(-) CR

Absence of phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_239879]-color two-tube approach developed and validated by 
[CONTACT_239952] a minimum 
sensitivity of 1 in 10⁵ nucleated cells or higher.
Stringent Complete Response (sCR) 
Complete Response as defined below plus: 
Normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by 
[CONTACT_212272] (presence/ absence of clonal cells is 
based on the kappa/ lambda ratio. 
Complete Response (CR) 
Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue 
plasmacytomas and ≤5% plasma cells in bone marrow 
Near Complete Response (nCR) 
Defined as absence of myeloma protein on electrophoresis, independent of 
immunofixation status[50]
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
54Serum and urine M-protein detectable by [CONTACT_145168] 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level <100mg 
per 24h.  If the serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, a ≥90% decrease in the 
difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-
protein criteria.
Partial Response (PR) 
≥50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by 
≥90% or to <200mg per 24h.  If the serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, a 
≥50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is 
required in place of the M-protein criteria 
Stable Disease (SD) 
Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR or progressive disease.  All categories also 
require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies 
were performed. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response 
requirements. 
Progressive disease (PD) 
Requires any one or more of the following: 
Increase of ≥25% from lowest response value in the following on 2 consecutive 
measurements: 
oSerum M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥0.5g/dl). The 
serum M-component increases of ≥1 gm/dl are sufficient to define relapse if 
starting M-component is ≥5g/dl. 
oUrine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥200mg/24h 
oOnly in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: the 
difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. The absolute 
increase must be >10mg/dl. 
oBone marrow plasma cell percentage: the absolute % must be ≥10% 
oDefinite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or 
definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas 
oDevelopment of hypercalcemia that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell 
proliferative disorder.
Relapse from CR
Any one or more of the following:
oReappearance of serum or urine M-protein by [CONTACT_145169].  Appearance of monoclonal or oligoclonal bands that are 
different from original isotype may not be defined as “relapse from CR”. 
Oftentimes, such bands may indicate fluctuations in immunological 
parameters that are not reflective of MM disease. In these situations, 
immunofixation and electrophoresis will be interpreted by [CONTACT_239953] “relapse”.
oDevelopment of ≥ 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma

7.4 NIH REQUIRED DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
7.4.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team 
The clinical research team will meet approximately weekly when patients are being actively 
treated on the trial to discuss each patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose 
escalation if applicable will be made based on the toxicity data from prior patients. 
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a lead 
associate investigator. Events meeting requirements for expedited reporting as described in 
section 7.2.[ADDRESS_291284] a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product (ICH E6 (R2)).
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
Death,
A life-threatening adverse event (see section 8.1.3)
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62487]/admission that is pre-planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study), a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912]-existing 
condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without a serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered a serious adverse event.
oA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/admission that is solely driven by [CONTACT_105]-medical reasons (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62488]) is not considered a serious adverse 
event.

57oEmergency room visits or stays in observation units that do not result in admission to 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62489] a serious adverse event. The reason for seeking 
medical care should be evaluated for meeting one of the other serious criteria.
Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
A congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
8.1.3 Life-threatening 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life-threatening" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. (21CFR312.32)

8.5.2 Reporting Pregnancy to [COMPANY_010]
[IP_ADDRESS] Contraception/Female
Females of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while being 
treated with carfilzomib. Given that carfilzomib was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal 
aberration test in peripheral blood lymphocytes, as a precaution, females of childbearing 
potential and/or their male partners should use effective contraception methods or abstain from 
sexual activity during and for [ADDRESS_291291] to the fetus. 
Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, carfilzomib can cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman. Carfilzomib caused embryo-fetal toxicity in pregnant 
rabbits at doses that were lower than in subjects receiving the recommended dose. carfilzomib 
administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic 
at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day in rats or up to 0.8 mg/kg/day in rabbits. 
If carfilzomib is used during pregnancy, or if the subject becomes pregnant while taking this 
drug, she should inform the investigator or study staff immediately. The investigator should 
notify [COMPANY_010] of the pregnancy and discuss follow-up with the subject. It is not known if 
carfilzomib will reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Due to an increased risk of venous 
thrombosis associated with carfilzomib, subjects currently using oral contraceptives or a 
hormonal method of contraception associated with a risk of thrombosis should consider an 
alternative method of effective contraception. 
The length of time contraception should be used and acceptable contraceptive methods will be 
discussed with all subjects at the time of enrollment and during participation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Contraception/Male:
Males of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid fathering a child while being treated 
with carfilzomib. The potential for carfilzomib to be transferred via semen and its effect on 
sperm are unknown. Male subjects treated with carfilzomib and/ or their female partners (if of 
childbearing potential) should use effective contraceptive methods or abstain from sexual 
activity while treated with carfilzomib for [ADDRESS_291292].
The length of time contraception should be used and acceptable contraceptive methods will be 
discussed with all subjects at the time of enrollment and during participation.

[IP_ADDRESS] SAE Reporting to BMS
All adverse experience reports must include the patient number, age, sex, weight, severity of 
reaction (e.g. mild, moderate, severe), relationship to drug (e.g. probably related, unknown 
relationship, definitely not related), date and time of administration of test medications and all 
concomitant medications, and medical treatment provided.   The investigator is responsible for 
evaluating all adverse events to determine whether criteria for “serious” and as defined above are 
present.  The investigator is responsible for reporting adverse events to BMS as described below.
Serious adverse events (SAE) are defined above. The investigator must inform BMS in writing 
using a MedWatch 3500A form of any SAE as soon as possible or at least within [ADDRESS_291294] be completed and supplied to BMS by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours/[ADDRESS_291295](s), if available.  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end 
date for the adverse event or laboratory values received after the report) must be documented on 
a follow-up report.  A final report to document resolution of the SAE is required.  The 
Celgene/BMS tracking number (RV-MM-NCI-0719) and the institutional protocol number 
should be included on SAE reports (or on the fax cover letter) sent to BMS.  A copy of the fax 
transmission confirmation of the SAE report to BMS should be attached to the SAE and retained

Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. the outcome of all pregnancies 
occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_291302] dose of carfilzomib should, if possible, be followed up and documented. Pregnant 
partners may be offered the opportunity to participate in an institutional pregnancy registry 
protocol (e.g., the NIH IRP pregnancy registry study) to provide data about the outcome of the 
pregnancy for safety reporting purposes.
8.[ADDRESS_291303] and the adverse event.  CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all 
investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s 
IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as possible, in accordance to [ADDRESS_291304] annually in a summary format.
8.8 SPONSOR PROTOCOL DEVIATION REPORTING
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any non-compliance with the clinical trial Protocol, Manual 
of Operational Procedures (MOP) and other Sponsor approved study related documents, GCP, or 
protocol-specific procedural requirements on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support 
of the clinical trial.
It is the responsibility of the study staff to document any protocol deviation identified by [CONTACT_83943] (PDTS) online 
application. The entries into the PDTS online application should be timely, complete, and 
maintained per CCR PDTS user requirements. 
In addition, any deviation to the protocol should be documented in the participant’s source 
records and reported to the reviewing IRB per their guidelines. OSRO required protocol 
deviation reporting is consistent with E6(R2) GCP: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1): 4.5 
Compliance with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol 
deviations.
9 CLINICAL MONITORING
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure:
that the rights of the participants are protected; 
that the study is implemented per the approved protocol, Good Clinical Practice and 
standard operating procedures; and, 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
63the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained.  
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_83944] (OSRO) Sponsor and Regulatory Oversight Support (SROS) Services contractor. 
Clinical site monitoring activities will be based on OSRO standards, FDA Guidance E6(R2) 
Good Clinical Practice: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) March 2018, and applicable 
regulatory requirements.
Details of clinical site monitoring will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_62554]. CMPs will be protocol-specific, risk-based and tailored to address human 
subject protections and integrity of the study data. OSRO will determine the intensity and 
frequency of monitoring based on several factors, including study type, phase, risk, complexity, 
expected enrollment rate, and any unique attributes of the study and the site. The Sponsor will 
conduct a periodic review of the CMP to confirm the plan's continued appropriateness. A change 
to the protocol, significant or pervasive non-compliance with GCP, or the protocol may trigger 
CMP updates.
OSRO SROS Monitoring visits and related activities will be conducted throughout the life cycle 
of each protocol. The first activity is before the study starts to conduct a Site Assessment Visit 
(SAV) (as warranted), followed by a Site Initiation Visit (SIV), Interim Monitoring Visit(s) 
(IMVs), and a study Close-Out Visit (COV).
Some monitoring activities may be performed remotely, while others will occur at the study site(s). 
Monitoring visit reports will describe visit activities, observations, and associated action items or 
follow-up required for resolution of any issues, discrepancies, or deviations. Monitoring reports 
will be distributed to the study PI, NCI CCR QA, CCR Protocol Support Office, and the Sponsor 
regulatory file.
The site Monitor will inform the study team of any deviations observed during monitoring visits. 
If unresolved, the Monitor will request that the site Staff enter the deviations in the CCR Protocol 
Deviation Tracking System (PDTS) for deviation reporting to the Sponsor and as applicable per 
institutional and IRB guidance.
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 SAMPLE SIZE/ACCRUAL RATE
The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether use of CRd is associated with a 
substantial fraction of patients with high-risk SMM who exhibit at least a VGPR from baseline 
until the end of 8 cycles of treatment. 
The study will initially enroll 12 evaluable patients and determine M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_239880]-treatment as well as after each cycle of treatment. The percent decline from baseline will be 
determined for each patient. If 12 evaluable patients are enrolled and if 5 or more patients exhibit 
a VGPR, then the probability of this occurring is 7.3% if the true probability of a VGPR decline 
is 20%. The probability of 5 or more with a 50% decline is 80.6% if the true probability of a 
VGPR decline is 50%. Thus, obtaining 5 or more patients out of 12 with a VGPR would provide 
strong evidence that the true probability of a VGPR was consistent with 50% or more as opposed 
to 20%. 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
64In order to allow for a small number of inevaluable patients, the initial accrual ceiling will be set 
at 14.
If 1-2 patients per month can be enrolled on this trial, it expected that accrual could be completed 
in 6 to 12 months.
Amendment C (version date 07/11/2013) will permit enrollment to a replicate cohort in order to 
more precisely define the response rate to the CRd regimen in this population.  Based on 
preliminary results from the first [ADDRESS_291305] 
experienced a VGPR or better response (87.5%).  Amendment C (version date 07/11/2013) will 
allow enrollment of a replicate cohort of 16 evaluable patients in order to estimate the response 
rate in this cohort independently from the initial cohort of 12 evaluable patients. With 16 
evaluable patients, a two-sided 90% confidence interval for the proportion of patients with a 
VGPR or greater will extend +/- 14% from the observed proportion if the expected proportion is 
87%. 
Thus, 16 newly enrolled patients will be evaluated for response separately from the initial 12 
patients. If the proportions with a VGPR are sufficiently similar (approximately p>0.35 by a 
Fisher’s exact test), then in addition to reporting the results separately, an additional result will 
be the combined proportion of VGPR or greater along with a two-sided 90% confidence interval 
about this observed proportion. If there are 28 total patients which can be combined in an 
evaluation, a simple two-sided 90% confidence interval for the proportion of patients with VGPR 
or greater will extend approximately +/- 11% from the observed proportion if the expected 
proportion is 86% (24 of 28 responses, for example).
Enrolling additional patients to this replicate cohort will allow the secondary endpoints of 
duration of response and PFS to be determined with greater precision; it will also allow us to 
conduct stratified analysis by [CONTACT_239954] (hyperdiploid vs. non-hyperdiploid); and it will 
provide greater safety data than that available from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_210369] [ADDRESS_291306](-). Beginning with 
Amendment L (version date 05/17/2018), the primary objective of the trial is revised to increase 
the precision of the estimate of the MRD (-) CR rate. The trial will be extended to enroll a total 
of 50 evaluable patients to do so. With a total of 50 evaluable patients, the 95% two-sided 
confidence interval width about a conservative estimate of the MRD (-) CR rate of 70% would 
be +/- 12.7%. If the MRD (-) CR rate were 85%, 50 patients would permit the estimate to be 
determined with a 95% two-sided confidence interval of +/- 9.9%.
As of January 2018, a total of [ADDRESS_291307] been enrolled on the trial and it is anticipated that 
1-2 patients per month will continue to be accrued. Thus, it is expected that the remaining 29 
patients can be enrolled in approximately 2 years. To allow for a number of inevaluable patients 
and screen failures, the accrual ceiling will be set at 63.
10.2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY/EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS
Secondary endpoints are duration of response and progression free survival (both biochemical 
progression and progression to overt symptomatic multiple myeloma).  Duration of response is 
defined as time from response to disease progression or death.  Progression free survival is 
defined as time of study entry to progression or death.  Duration of response and progression free 
Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/[ADDRESS_291308]-negative CR and OS.
A number of correlative studies will be performed in order to assess carfilzomib in vitro 
biological activity and investigate minimal residual disease in SMM.  Minimal residual disease 
will be further explored using multi-parametric flow cytometry, PCR-based techniques, and 
advanced imaging.
Beginning with Amendment L (version date 05/17/2018), the secondary objectives will also 
include:
1. To estimate the durable MRD (-) CR rate, estimating the fraction of patients who have an 
MRD (-) CR for 1 year as a minimum. This fraction will be estimated along with a 95% 
two-sided confidence interval. 
2. To compare the outcomes among the [ADDRESS_291309] (-) CR rates will be compared between 
these two cohorts of patients using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. All other comparisons 
of outcomes between the two cohorts will be interpreted as exploratory and will be done 
using appropriate non-parametric statistical tests without adjustment for multiple 
comparisons.
3. To obtain and report safety data on all enrolled evaluable patients to fully characterize the 
safety of the regimen in a modestly large number of subjects treated on one protocol.
An exploratory objective is also added to evaluate FISH data on available patients enrolled 
following amendment L (version date 05/17/2018) with respect to classification into high risk vs. 
non-high-risk patients. Known high risk FISH markers in multiple myeloma literature will be 
evaluated, namely, 4;14, 14;16, 14;20, del 17p, and 8;14. When available outside lab results will 
be confirmed either by [CONTACT_239955] (Test ID: PCPDF, Plasma Cell Proliferative Disorder (PCPD)) and mutual results will be 
used for the analysis.

Abbreviated Title:  CRd for Smoldering Myeloma
Version Date:  01/01/2024
66of all hematologic malignancies, affecting 20,000 patients annually[51].  Recent studies have 
shown that MM is preceded by [CONTACT_239956].[5]  Rate of progression at 5 years from high 
risk SMM to MM is 72-76% at 5 years with a median TTP of < 2 years [12, 13].  MM affects all 
genders and races.  Incidence rates of myeloma is higher among Blacks compared to Caucasians, 
affecting 14.3 black males per 100, 000 males and 10.0 black females per 100,000 females 
compared to 6.7 white males per 100, 000 males and 4.1 white females per 100, 000 women.  
The median age at death for myeloma is 75 years of age[51].  As such, we expect that the 
majority of patients enrolled in this trial will be older adults of either gender or race. MM 
patients enrolled on this study will consist of patients referred to and screened at the NIH 
Clinical Center. There will be no subject selection bias with regard to gender, ethnicity, or race. 
This protocol excludes lactating and pregnant women from receiving this investigational drug to 
avoid any possible risks to the fetus or newborn.  
12.2 PARTICIPATION OF C HILDREN
Pediatric patients with SMM are extremely rare. Patients under the age of 18 are excluded from 
this study because inclusion of a rare younger patient will not provide adequate generalizable 
information to justify their inclusion in this study.
12.3 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
Currently, MM is an incurable malignancy with frequent complications of skeletal fractures, 
anemia, renal failure and hypercalcemia.  Conventional radiographs reveal that 79% of patients 
will have observed skeletal abnormalities at time of diagnosis[52].  Treatment of high risk SMM 
patients may reduce skeletal related events from occurring and prevent morbidity from 
irreversible bone damage seen with MM.  In addition, treating SMM with potent anti-MM 
therapeutics before disease biology becomes aggressive in later disease states may also increase 
the potential for a cure or prolong progression free survival or overall survival.  The added 
benefit of searching for minimal residual disease markers using FDG-PET CT, flow cytometry, 
and PCR techniques will allow us to probe depth of response beyond standard insufficient 
clinical markers.
Risks of the study include exposing asymptomatic patients without clinical MM to 
chemotherapeutic agents.  However, it must be noted that carfilzomib, a new-generation 
proteasome inhibitor, has been tested in phase [ADDRESS_291311] recent phase 1 
trial in newly diagnosed MM patients has shown >83% VGPR rates after a median of 8 cycles in 
12 patients with <1% neuropathy.[53] Procedures required for obtaining samples/data for 
experimental purposes (venipuncture, urine collection, PET/CT scan, DW-MRI and bone 
marrow biopsy) are of limited risk to the patient.  Although patients will suffer some additional 
pain or discomfort from the PET/CT scans and annual bone marrow biopsies, clinical experience 
has shown that the medical risk is limited. 
The genetic testing performed on the study carries with it a potential loss of privacy in case of 
database compromise, as well as psychological distress to participant and possibly family 
members in the event that incidental findings are disclosed.

necessity to remain still on back for 30 minutes. The DW-MRI may cause physical discomfort 
due to necessity to remain still on back for about 1½ hours. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Psychological or Social Risks Associated with Return of Incidental or Secondary 
Findings
Learning of genetic risks for another disease or disability may cause emotional distress.
12.4 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
Given the high rates of progression specific to the high risk SMM populations and low toxicity 
profile of combination therapy, risk of exposure does not seem to outweigh the clinical benefit 
that patients may derive from therapy.  More importantly, much of patient morbidity in MM is 
associated with pain from irreversible skeletal related events.  Such a trial would aim to treat or 
cure the disease before irreversible bone damage occurs or before aggressive clinical MM 
occurs.  Discomfort from venipuncture, bone marrow biopsy, PET/CT scan and DW-MRI is 
minimal and of limited risk compared to the knowledge gained by [CONTACT_239957].

Version Date:  01/01/2024
72Store labeled quarantined drug in a temperature-monitored refrigerator and ensure they 
are physically segregated from the drug that is available for use.
[COMPANY_010] will instruct the clinical site on how to proceed with quarantined vial(s).
[IP_ADDRESS] Calculation of Dose
Each dose will consist of Carfilzomib for Injection administered on a mg/m2 basis and should be 
based on the patient's actual calculated body surface area (BSA). 
The BSA should be calculated based upon the institution's practice and method of calculation 
should remain consistent throughout a subject's participation in the trial.
Subjects with a BSA > 2.2 m2 will receive a dose based upon a 2.2 m2 BSA.
14.1.4 Stability and Storage  
[IP_ADDRESS] Lyophilized Drug Product
Lyophilized Carfilzomib for Injection must be kept in the labeled drug cartons and stored at 2°C 
- 8°C (36°F - 46°F) in a refrigerator.
If procedures permit, the refrigerator should be continuously monitored, and temperature records 
retained for review. 
The refrigerator should also be on a backup generator and alarmed for temperature deviations if 
available.  Lyophilized Carfilzomib for Injection exposed at any time to temperatures exceeding 
30°C / 86°F must be discarded
[IP_ADDRESS] Reconstituted Drug Product
Once a drug vial is reconstituted and inspected, the clear solution can be stored in a refrigerator 
(recommended) controlled from 2°C - 8°C (36°F - 46°F) or at room temperature from 15°C - 
30°C (59°F - 86°F) until use. Once reconstituted, Carfilzomib for Injection is stable for a total of 
24 hours. DO NOT FREEZE LYOPHILIZED OR RECONSTITUTED DRUG.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diluted Drug Product 
After dilution with 5% Dextrose Injection for clinical use, Carfilzomib should preferably be 
stored under refrigeration unless plan for administration immediately following preparation. 
Diluted Carfilzomib is stable for 24 hours in the refrigerator or 4 hours at room temperature 
from the time of vial reconstitution.  If refrigerated, the infusion solution should be equilibrated 
to room temperature prior to administration.
14.1.5 Administration procedures 
Carfilzomib will be administered by [CONTACT_162141] 30 minutes through a peripheral 
or central venous access device as a secondary infusion into a primary line containing 5% 
Dextrose Injection. Infusions can be stopped or slowed down if patient is experiencing infusion 
reactions. 
Do not mix carfilzomib with or administer as an infusion simultaneously with other drugs.
Flush line AFTER drug administration with a minimum of 50 mL of 0.9% Normal Saline or 5% 
Dextrose Injection (particularly for infusions through a peripheral line to minimize phlebitis 
risk).

Version Date:  01/01/[ADDRESS_291317] on human cytochrome CYP3A4/5. Given that the clearance of 
carfilzomib likely occurs extrahepatically via the activity of epoxide hydrolase and peptidase 
activities, the clinical relevance of these in vitro results is not clear. No clinically significant drug 
interactions have been noted to date in patients receiving a variety of agents metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4. Moreover, no dose adjustments have been required for any concomitant medication in 
patients receiving carfilzomib. However, caution should be exercised in administration of 
concomitant medications which are substrates of human CYP3A4.

14.2.1 Source 
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) is provided to investigator by [CONTACT_239959]. under Cooperative 
Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).
14.2.2 Toxicity 
A comprehensive listing of all toxicities (i.e., very common, common, etc.) are listed in the 
informed consent document.  The approved USPI [INVESTIGATOR_239882].  See below information regarding most significant toxicities:  
Fetal Risk 
Do not use REVLIMID during pregnancy. Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused 
limb abnormalities in a developmental monkey study. Thalidomide is a known human 
teratogen that causes severe life-threatening human birth defects.  If lenalidomide is used 
during pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or death to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_106784]. In women of 
childbearing potential, obtain 2 negative pregnancy tests before starting REVLIMID® 
treatment. Women of childbearing potential must use 2 forms of contraception or 
continuously abstain from heterosexual sex during and for 4 weeks after REVLIMID 
treatment.
Hematologic Toxicity
REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In the pooled MM 
studies Grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities were more frequent in patients treated with the 
combination of REVLIMID and dexamethasone than in patients treated with dexamethasone 
alone.
Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism
Venous thromboembolic events (predominantly deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism) have occurred in patients with MM treated with lenalidomide combination 
therapy.  A significantly increased risk of DVT and PE was observed in patients with MM 
who were treated with REVLIMID and dexamethasone therapy in a clinical trial. 
Allergic Reactions
Angioedema, anaphylaxis, and serious dermatologic reactions including Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome
(SJS) and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (TEN) have been reported. These events can be fatal. 
Patients with a prior history of Grade 4 rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not

83APPENDIX  B:  REQUIREMENTS FOR REMS
Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control 
Methods
Requirements for REMS
Patients should be instructed never to give lenalidomide to another person.
Patients will be asked to take part in a mandatory confidential survey prior to initiation of 
lenalidomide.  To take the survey, they will be instructed to call the BMS Customer Care 
Center at [PHONE_3213].  Male patients will be asked to take the survey monthly.  
Female patients will be asked to take survey periodically (monthly if females of 
childbearing potential and every 6 months if females of not childbearing potential).  
Female patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 28 days following 
discontinuation of lenalidomide.
Male patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during therapy or for at least 28 
days following discontinuation of lenalidomide.  
Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy may be prescribed with each cycle of 
therapy.
All patients will be required to sign the REVLIMID, Patient-Physician Agreement Form.
Males must practice complete abstinence or use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_239963], during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following 
lenalidomide discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.  See 
below for further details
Females of childbearing potential must agree to use two reliable forms of contraception 
simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during 
the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting 
lenalidomide; 2) throughout the entire duration of lenalidomide treatment; 3) during dose 
interruptions; and 4) for at least [ADDRESS_291324] be registered into the mandatory REMS® program, and be willing 
and able to comply with the requirements of REMS®.

84Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature female who: 1) has 
not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the 
preceding 24 consecutive months).
The investigator must ensure that:
Females of childbearing potential comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk 
minimization, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding
Females NOT of childbearing potential acknowledge that she understands the hazards 
and necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide
Male patients taking lenalidomide acknowledge that he understands that traces of 
lenalidomide have been found in semen, that he understands the potential teratogenic risk 
if engaged in sexual activity with a female of childbearing potential, and that he 
understands the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if engaged 
in sexual activity with a female of childbearing potential.  
Contraception
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable 
forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual 
intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before 
starting lenalidomide; 2) throughout the entire duration of lenalidomide treatment; 3) during dose 
interruptions; and 4) for at least [ADDRESS_291325] include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contraception:  
oHighly effective methods:
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants)
Tubal ligation
Partner’s vasectomy
oAdditional effective methods:
Male condom
Diaphragm
Cervical Cap
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma 
taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_64807]. If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should 
switch to one of the effective method listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism 
continues for 4−6  weeks after discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of 
contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co-treatment with dexamethasone.

85Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk 
of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics 
should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia. 
Pregnancy testing
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 50 mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing potential who 
commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.
Before starting lenalidomide
Female Patients:  FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 
mIU/mL) prior to prescribing lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within 
10-[ADDRESS_291326] be performed 
within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide.  The patient may not receive lenalidomide 
until the Investigator has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative.
Male Patients:  Must agree to practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during 
sexual contact [CONTACT_197013], during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following 
lenalidomide discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.  
During study participation and for 28 days following lenalidomide discontinuation 
Female Patients:
FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for 
the first [ADDRESS_291327] 28 days of lenalidomide treatment, including dose interruptions, and 
then every 14 days throughout the remaining duration of lenalidomide treatment, 
including dose interruptions, at lenalidomide discontinuation, and at Day 14 and Day 28 
following lenalidomide discontinuation.  
At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing to use 
two reliable methods of birth control at each visit during the time that birth control is 
required.  
If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study patient, lenalidomide must 
be immediately discontinued.
Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patient misses her period or if 
her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Lenalidomide treatment must 
be temporarily discontinued during this evaluation.
Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at 
least 28 days after lenalidomide discontinuation.
Male Patients:
Must practice complete abstinence or use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_239964], during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following 
lenalidomide discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734110] 31, 2015  8 
 PROTOCOL SUMMARY   
 
Title : Patient Response to an Integrated Orthotic and Rehabilitation In itiative for 
Traumatic Injuries. The PRIORITI -MTF Study  
Sponsor : DOD PRORP  
 
Type of study : Before -after study design; participants serve as their own controls  
 
Objectives : The primary objective of this study  is to examine the benefits (and cost -benefits) of 
an integrated orthotic and rehabilitation program that incorporates the Intrepid Dynamic 
Exoskeletal Orthosis ( IDEO ) and the Return to Run ( RTR ) physical therapy regimen, but 
designed for scalability in the broader  military environment  (i.e. beyond San Antonio Military 
Medical Center where the program was developed) . 
 
Participants will be evaluated at baseline (T0), immediately following 4 weeks of physical 
therapy with the IDEO (T 2), at 6 months following completion of all physical therapy (T 3) and 
at 12 months following completion of all physical therapy (T 4).  See Figure 1.  
 
Specific Aim #1: To assess immediate improvements in functional performanc e following 
completion of the P RIORITI program. Functiona l performance will be measured using well -
validated assessments of speed, agility, power, and postural stability. Hypotheses to be tested 
include:   
a. Compared to baseline (T0), functional performance will be significantly better immediately 
following completion of the PRIORITI program (T8)  
 
Specific Aim #2: To assess long -term improvements in both functional performance and patient 
reported outcomes 1 year after completion of the PR IORITI program.  Principal hypotheses to be 
tested include:   
a. Compared to baseline (T0), functional performance will be significantly better at one year 
following completion of the PRIORITI program (T 4) 
b. Compared to baseline ( T0) patient reported outcomes will be significantly better at one 
year following completion of the PRIORITI program (T 4)   
 
Specific Aim #3:  To document patterns of device use, use of ambulatory aids, shoe wear and 
patient reported satisfaction associated with the IDEO.  Participants will be asked about their 
satisfaction with comfort, cosmesis, ease of use, and durability.  As this is primarily a descriptive 
analysis, no hypotheses will be tested.  
 
Specific Aim #4:  To assess the economic impact of the PRI ORITI program by (i) measuring 
one-year costs associated with participation in PRIORITI and compare these costs to those 
projected under standard of care; and (ii) estimating lifetime cost -effectiveness of the PRIORITI 
program relative to standard of care.   As this is primarily a descriptive analysis, no hypotheses 
will be tested.  
 
Study design : The effectiveness of the PRIORITI program will be evaluated using a before -after 
 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734111] 31, 2015  9 
 study design where participants serve as their own controls.   
 
Study duration : 3 years (6 month planning  and training , 10 month accrual, 12 month final follow -
up, 8 month analysis and writing).  
 
Sample size : 90 participants will be consented to participate in this study.  
 
Number of study sites : 3 Military Treatment Facilities (MTF’s).

5. Neurologic, musculoskeletal or other conditions affecting contralateral extremity 
 preventi ng the study of  a healthy control limb  
6. Unable or unwilling to participate in two 4 -week PT programs  
7. Pregnancy

Outcome measures   
Physical impairment  will be determined using objective performance measures of agility ([ADDRESS_734113]), strength and power (sit to stand test and timed stair ascent), 
speed (self selected walking speed and [ADDRESS_734114] shuttle run), and postural stability (single leg 
stance) .   
Levels of participation  will be measured using self reported measures of return to usual major 
activity ( work, active duty, school, home management)  and the Paffenbarger Activity Scale  
(PPAQ) that measures participation in light, moderate  and vigorous recreation al or sports 
activities .  
 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734115] 31, 2015  10 
 Patient reported function and health related quality of life as measured using the total and 
dimension specific sub scales of the Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (SMFA).  
Statistical analysis : We are interested in assessing immediate a nd long -term improvements in 
functional performance and self reported outcomes. One -sided paired t -tests will be used to test 
for improvements in outcomes, comparing baseline data to later outcomes. Differences in means 
between follow up and baseline will be reported along with 95% confidence intervals.  
Analysis of costs and benefits of PRIORITI will include an analysis of costs and outcomes 
observed over a [ADDRESS_734116] -effectiveness projected over the patient lifetime.  
Safety monitoring : The Medical Monitor is responsible for monitoring serious adverse events 
(SAEs) as the study progresses to ensure patient safety. The Medical Monitor may convene a 
meeting of the DSMB to evaluate any SAEs that he/she determines require immediat e attention.  
Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) :  The DSMB is an independent body responsible 
for evaluating recruitment, safety and outcome data. The DSMB has the authority to stop the 
study based on its findings.

PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734118] mostly been 
limited to plastic posterior leaf spring ankle foot orthosis (AFOs).  Many limb salvage pati ents 
have been unable to achieve their desired functional goals due to volumetric muscle loss  17, 
ectopic bone, chronic pain and nerve injury  8,13.   In th e current military conflict, complications 
and the inability to achieve the desired level of activity  have contributed to high rates of late 
amputation 18-20. 
 
Current Orthotic Options . Ankle foot orthoses are frequently prescribed for patients with ankle 
dorsiflexion and plantarflexion weakness due to a variety of etiologies from cerebral palsy in 
children to trauma and stroke in adults. Numerous types of AFOs exist for different clini cal 
scenarios, each with specific clinical goals for their use. In particular, AFOs are used to 
counteract both ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion weakness by [CONTACT_558980] (i.e. to counteract large 
plantarflexion moment in dorsiflexion weakness, and large dorsiflexion moment with 
plantarflexion weakness). Patients with deficiencies in both of these muscle groups have 
significant challenges with normal gait, as they are unable to create the large torques and powers 
needed to overcome these limitations without assistance. Conventional rigid AFOs typi[INVESTIGATOR_558956] a hard plastic mold extending from the metatarsal heads to the proximal leg. These 
place the ankle in a neut ral position and help to prevent excessive plantarflexion during swing 
phase that may lead to a “steppage gait,” and ensure that the heel contacts the ground at initial 
strike (first rocker). These AFOs do not provide any assistance with plantarflexion, an d cannot 
contribute to push -off at terminal stance (third rocker) 34-37. 
 
In an effort to provide more plantarflexion power, the “energy -storing AFO” was designed. The 
design typi[INVESTIGATOR_4755] a carbon fiber material at the posterior aspect of the AFO. 
Biomechanical data suggests that deformation of the carbon fiber spring which occurs during 
ankle dorsiflexion in stance (second rocker) is returned during the third rocker allowing for more 
powerful plantarflexion during step -off. The hope is these devices will allow patients with both 
plantarflexion and dorsiflexion weakness to have more normal ankle biomechanics and increased 
ankle power. This, in turn, may lead to increased gait velocity, decreased work of ambulation, 
and may allow the patient adequate po wer to run 34-37. Energy -storing carbon fiber orthoses have 
been shown to improve abnormal gait patterns, temporal -spatial parameters, increase stride 
length, ankle power and range of motion in small series of patients 38-41. However, these studies 
largely  address pediatric patients with cerebral palsy, myelomeningocele or other motor 
disorders, or adults with hemiplegia. No study to date has investigated the use of energy -storing 
orthoses in a traumatic limb salvage population.  
 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734119] 31, 2015  13 
  
The Intrepid Dynamic Exosk eletal Orthosis (IDEO) and Return to Run (RTR) Clinical Pathway.   
The Intrepid Dynamic Exoskeletal Orthosis (IDEO) ( Figure 1 ) is a custom,  energy -storing 
carbon fiber orthosis specifically developed at the Center for the Intrepid, San Antonio Military 
Medical Center (SAMMC) for trauma patients undergoing limb salvage .  The IDEO device is an 
FDA exempt  device under [ADDRESS_734120] from mid to terminal stance.  This also allows 
for forefoot loading during agility an d running activities.  The modular design allows for 
alignment adjustment, the ability to change strut stiffness based on individual patient strength 
gains, and facilitates donning and doffing to accommodate volumetric muscle changes from 
strength gains or  edema. The IDEO will be labeled with the following information for use in this 
study: “CAUTION --Investigational device. Limited by [CONTACT_44505] .”  
 
 
To maximize an individual’s potential success in utilizing the IDEO, a high intensity, sports 
medicine based approach to rehabilitation was developed in collaboration with the departments 
of orthopaedics, physical therapy and orthotics/prosthetics at the C enter for the Intrepid and the 
San Antonio Military Medical Center.   The multidisciplinary Return to Run (RTR) clinical 
pathway focuses on strength, agility and speed with the goal of enabling patients to return to 
running, sports and military deployment 21, 23.    Running was chosen as a surrogate for the return 
to high level function based on the successes of amputation rehabilitation programs 42.  Also, 
working alongside similar patients who have been fitted with an IDEO provides a built -in 
support grou p and helps build self efficacy, which is one of the most important predictors of 
good outcomes and return to usual activity.  The early success of this clinical pathway showed 
80% return to running 23. In addition to success in high level rehabilitation  goals, the RTR 
Clinical Pathway has returned wounded warriors to duty to include deployment 21, [ADDRESS_734121].   In a small 
study of 18 subjects with unilateral dorsiflexion and/or  plantarflexion weakness, the functional 
performance of the IDEO was compared against two commercially available orhthoses and no 
orthosis.  All participants in this study also completed physical therapy component of the Return 
to Run Clinical Pathway. Per formance wearing the IDEO was compared to that wearing the 
Allard BlueRocker™ (BR), a rigid plastic posterior leaf spring (PLS), and no brace (NONE) 22. 
Subjects were evaluated on six functional tests wearing the IDEO, BR, PLS, and NONE. Brace 
order was ra ndomized and 5 trials were completed for each measure. Performance was Figure 1: The IDEO  

 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734122] 31, 2015  14 
 significantly better in the IDEO on all functional measures compared to all other bracing 
conditions (p <0.004), with the exception of the sit -to-stand five times, in which there was on ly a 
significant improvement against the BR (p =0.014).  The forty yard dash improved by 37% over 
the PLS and NONE, and by 28% over the BR.  The BR demonstrated a significant improvement 
in the forty yard dash compared to NONE (p =0.033), and self -selected  walking velocity on level 
terrain over NONE and PLS (p <0.028), but no significant difference was found between the 
PLS, BR and NONE in any other functional measure. This study did not, however, evaluate the 
impact on patient reported outcomes of the impr ovements in functional performance  43.   
 
 
2.2 Rationale  
 
The development of a new custom energy -storing ankle foot orthosis (AFO), the Intrepid 
Dynamic Exoskeletal Orthosis (IDEO), integrated with the RTR Clinical Pathway designed to 
optimize the patient’s adaptation to the IDEO, may significantly improve limb salvage outcomes, 
reduce the number of delayed amputations, and provide both service members and civilians who 
undergo limb salvage a higher quality of life  21-24.  While some  initial studies  point to the benefits 
of the IDEO, these studies were performed using a small number of patients treated at one 
military treatment facility (where the IDEO was developed and refined), using measures of 
functional performance assessed in a controlled envir onment  22.  Data are needed to replicate the 
positive results of this study at other military treatment facilities and provide evidence that 
improvements  in performance translate into longer term improvements in functional outcomes 
and quality of life.

4.  STUDY OVERVIEW  
The study is a clinical investigation  (study)  to evaluate the effectiveness of the IDEO, an 
investigational FDA -regulated medical device.  The effectiveness of the PRIORITI program will 
be evaluated using a before -after study design where participants serve as their own controls.   
A total of [ADDRESS_734126] 1 or more  years 
after their injury. To ensure we are enrolling a ‘stable’ population, we will exclude individuals 
whose f ractures and soft tissues injuries are not healed at the time of screening or for whom 
additional surgery is planned within the next six months.   
 
The study will be conducted by [CONTACT_558981] (METRC) 
(www.metrc.org).  Specifically, participants will be recruited, consented and evaluated  at 3 of 
METRC’s core military sites.  
 
The study procedures are summarized in the Figure below.

At the time of enrollment into the study (T0) , all participants (those who have screened 
eligible and have consented) will be asked to complete a battery  of performance tests to measure 
their baseline assessments of strength, agility , speed  and postural stability .  They will also 
complete several s tandardized assessments of self -reported functional activity, participation in 
major usual activity and sports  and leisure activities, presence of pain, and overall well being.   
At this time, basic information about the participants, their injury and their use of health and 
rehabilitation services in the previous year will be collected.   After completing these b aseline 
assessments, the Study Site Certified Prosthetist/ Orthotist (CPO) will take a cast of the leg and 
other pertinent measures that are needed for fabrication of the IDEO.  The  CPO will then 
fabricate the IDEO brace locally. The final fabricated device  given to each subject will be 
labeled with the following information: “CAUTION --Investigational device. Limited by [CONTACT_558982] .”  
 

 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734127] 31, 2015  16 
 During the following 2-4 weeks participants will  engage in a home physical therapy (PT) 
program as di rected by [CONTACT_3476] . The length of the home physical therapy program is 
dependant on the time required to fabricate the IDEO™. The focus of the Pre -IDEO PT is 
conditioning and building self -efficacy.  It will build on the principles of the Return to Ru n 
Clinical Pathway developed at the CFI.   
 
Following 2-4 weeks of home PT  (T1), the participant will be fitted with the IDEO  and engage 
in four weeks of Post -IDEO PT  at the study center . During these [ADDRESS_734128]-IDEO PT (T2), performance testing will be repeated and 
overall satisfaction with th e device assessed. The purpose of these assessments is to measure any 
immediate gains in function.  Participants will then be formally ‘discharged’ from the PRIORITI 
program.  They will be given the number of the Study Site Orthotist to call if any concerns  arise 
with the IDEO and its fit.  The costs associated with all visits to the orthotist during the 12 month 
follow -up period will be covered by [CONTACT_1758].    
 
At 6 months following the completion of the PRIORITI program (T3),  participants will  be 
contacte d by [CONTACT_558983] a brief interview by [CONTACT_648].  The 
main p urpose  of this phone call is to keep participants engaged in the study and motivate them to 
come back to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_558957] 12 months.  We will also use this opportunity to 
ask them questions about their functioning, satisfaction with the brace and use of services 
(overall and specific to the IDEO). This interview will last about 15 minutes.  During the call the 
he coordinator  will remind the participant of the 12 month follow up visit. If the participant is 
living outside of the research site ar ea, the coordinator  will inform the participant that travel 
expenses can be covered for the 12 month follow up visit.  (See appendix K).  
 
At 12 months following the completion of the PRIORITI program (T 4), participants will be 
asked to return to the Study C enter to repeat the performance tests and self reported measures of 
outcome and satisfaction with the IDEO. Additional questions regarding use of services (overall 
and specific to the IDEO) will also be asked.

5.2 Strategies for Recruitment and Screening  
 
Eligible study participants will be identified in several ways  as outlined below.  
 
The study center will reach out to orthopaedic surg eons, physical medicine and rehabilitation  
physicians and physical therap ists practicing in the military and veterans community to educate 
them about the study and ask for referrals of patients they believe may meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  
 
The participating study centers will query their orthopaedic registries and identify patients they 
treated one or more years ago for a severe traumatic lower extremity injury.  These individuals 
will be sent a letter and brochure (explaining the study, its risks and requirements)  from their 
treating physician or the director of orthopaedics if their treating physician is no longer 
practicing at the facility,  and encouraged to contact [CONTACT_558984]  (See Appendix H for draft) .

6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
6.[ADDRESS_734134] of the following:  
 
• Questions about the injury and its initial treatment to 
confirm the individual is 1 or more years out from a 
traumatic injury of the lower ext remity (at or below 
the knee) ( to include:  cause of the injury, when it 
occurred, where the person was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_558961] a description of the injury);  
• The Short Form Musculoskeletal Function Assessment 
(SMFA) to determine whether the individual is 
impaired or bothered by [CONTACT_558991].   
 
Individuals meeting the initial screening criteria will be mailed a consent form and will receive a 
follow up phone call within 5 business days. If at that time the patient decides to participate, the 
Research Coo rdinator will schedule an appointment to come to the study center for testing and 
final screening to confirm that the patient meets the final inclusion/exclusion criteria for the 
Figure [ADDRESS_734135] 31, 2015  21 
 study. The final (in person) screen will consist of a clinical assessment, me dical history, and 
interview .   
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_734136] will be documented in the patient’s record.  
 
Informed consent will take place at the study center before beginning the final in -person screen. 
The conversation will be initiated by [CONTACT_558992]. Patients will be provided a pamphlet describing the study, the risks and benefits of 
participation and what will be expected of them if they choose to participate. After reviewing all 
components of the in formed consent form, the surgeon investigator and the Research 
Coordinator will answer any questions the patient has about participating in the study. Consent 
will be obtained in accordance with principles of GCP and ICH guidelines.  
 
Following completion of informed consent, the surgeon  investigator  will conduct a clinical 
assessment, medical history, and interview to confirm eligibility . Patients who are ineligible will 
not continue in the study and will be withdrawn.  
 
All patients must be able to provid e informed consent; there will be no consent by [CONTACT_558993].  
 
All study  materials will be provided in English.   
 
Additionally, after  completion of informed consent, the participant information will be entered 
into REDCap where a study number will be assigned and final eligibility criteria confirmed.

6.2 Baseline Data Collection  
 
Once consented into the study, baseline data regarding participant characteristics, injury 
characteristics, fracture classification and medical history/co -morbidities will be collected and 
entered into the REDCap data collection system. An x -ray will be ob tained to confirm healing of 
the fracture and to identify presence of post -traumatic osteoarthritis.   This x -ray will be used to 
confirm suitability of the IDEO for the individual.  If, based on the x -ray, a decision is made that 
 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734137] 31, 2015  22 
 the patient is not suitabl e to receive the intervention,  he or she will be withdrawn from the study.  
Participants who remain eligible will  complete a performance assessment and a  brief interview . 
 
For patients treated acutely (initially at the time of the injury) in an institution  other than the 
recruiting institution, permission will be sought from the participant to access the medical 
records pertaining to the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

6.3.4   Retention  
 
Every effort will be made to retain participant s in the study.  The study participants will receive 
an honorarium in recognition of their time and effort.  We will provide them with challenge coin 
designed specifically for the METRC  and (for those not on active duty), a total of $[ADDRESS_734145] with them throughout the one -year follow -up (by [CONTACT_558994] ). This sum will 
be distributed as follows: $50 at baseline (T0), $75  at T1, $75 at T 2 and $100 at T4. We will also 
keep participants engaged through use of study updates on the METRC webpage and distribution 
of follow -up reminders and trinkets  imprinted with the study logo.  
6.3.5  Final Study Visit   
 
Participant s will com plete the study at month 12 . Any ongoing SAE ’s will be followed to

 Should a participant  terminate the study prematurely , if at all possible, all procedures required at 
the month 12 (T4) visit will be performed at his/her  final visit.  
 
6.4  Study Endpoints  
 
6.4.1 Primary Endpoint s 
 
The primary endpoint s are functional performance and self reported functioning as measured 
suing the Short Form Musculoskeletal Assessment (SMFA)  and the Veterans Health Survey 
(VR-12).  
 
Functional Performance  The performance test battery includes a dyad of a “less demanding” 
test and a “more demanding” test for three of the domains. At the study initiation visit, the 
treating surgeon will clinically evaluate the participant’s health, weight bearing and ambulatory 
status and will provide written approval in order to proceed with the performance tests. Prior to 
and during the performance tests, the participant will be reminded that he/she can  stop these 
activities at any point if he/she feels unsafe. Participants in the study will complete the “less 
demanding” test first and, if the score meets a critical threshold, they will move on to complete 
the “more demanding” test.  This approach will p rovide information on higher level functioning 
without risking the safety of those with significant impairment.  These dyads are summarized in 
the table below.  
 
Details of each of these assessments are provided 
below.  
• The Four Square Step Test (FSST)  is a dynamic 
test of balance and agility . It requires participants 
to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_558964], backward, and sideways, over a low 
obstacle 54.  The test has demon strated reliability 
and validity through correlation with existing 
balance tests and a positive predictive value of 
86% 54.  The FSST does not require any special 
equipment and   requires little space, and is timed using a stopwatch.  Raters place four can es 
(or pi[INVESTIGATOR_151097]) in a cross on the floor (all four canes lay 
flat on the floor).  The participant then steps as fast                                                                        
as possible into each square in a d esignated sequence (see Figure 3).

PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734148] is timed using a stopwatch and 
requires 10 meters of length, 5 meters of width, and 8 cones (or markers of some kind).   
• The 5x Sit to Stand Test (STS5)  54-[ADDRESS_734149] at any point.  
• Timed Stair Ascent : The timed stair ascent is an objective measure of mobility and power 62 
that requires the patient to demonstrate greater strength and range of motion than level 
ground walking. Patients are asked to climb a flight of stairs at their maximal rate, with or 
without holding onto the railing.   The rater uses a stopwatch to time the patient’s ascent up 
[ADDRESS_734150] provides data on higher levels of 
functional performance because of the level of challenge involved in climbing stairs  
• Self-selected walking velocity over level terrain (SSWV -L) is a commonly used measure 
of speed  and general physical capacity .62-64. Subjects will be asked to walk [ADDRESS_734151] as they can, with or without an assistive device. Use of assistive devices will 
be recorded, as described above. The time it takes for subjects to comp lete the task is 
measured with a stop watch and recorded as feet per second (ft/sec).  Use of a stopwatch has 
been found to have excellent concurrent validity with the gold standard of infrared timing 
gates, with an inter -rater reliability of 0.[ADDRESS_734152] s of walking speed 64. Four feet per second 
is considered an appropriate cut -off for impaired speed, since 4.2 ft/sec is an approximate 
gait velocity for adults, 20 -59 years old 63.  
 
• 10 Meter Shuttle Run  (40D) : The [ADDRESS_734153] is appropriate for patients at both lower and higher levels 
of functional ability.  
 
• Single Leg Stance:  The single leg stance is a measure of postural stability 66. Participants 
will be as ked to stand with arms crossed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_558965] 
[ADDRESS_734154] is done on both legs.  
 
Self -Reported Measures of Functio n will be assessed at baseline (T0) and at one -year (T 4).     
 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734155] 31, 2015  28 
 Overall Function and Well Being  will be measured using two instruments.   The Short 
Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA)  will be used to measure overall function and well 
being 67-68. The SMFA is a shorter version of the 101 -item Musculoskeletal Function Assessment 
(MFA) questionnaire. The SMFA is a 46 -item questionnaire consisting of the dysfunction and 
bother index.  The Dysfunction Index includes 34 items for assess ing patient function .  Subscores 
for the following 4 domains can be calculated: Daily Activities; Arm and Hand Function; 
Mobility and Emotional Status.  The  Bother Index consists of [ADDRESS_734156] how 
much patients are bothered by [CONTACT_558995]. The SMFA has been  evaluated for reliability, 
validity and responsiveness in patient populations  67. This scale has been chosen because it is a 
short, reliable, patient reported assessment of functional status that has been specifically 
designed for and validated  in patient s with musculoskeletal conditions, including acute injury  67-
68. 
 
We will also use the Veterans RAND 12 item Health Survey ( VR-12) as a generic health status 
measure from which a VR -6D can be computed for a cost -utility analysis 69-70. The VR-12 is a 
multi purpose short -form generic measure of health status.   It was developed to be a much 
shorter, yet valid, alternative to the VR-36 for use in large surveys of general and veteran 
populations.   The 12 items in the VR-12 are a subset of those in the VR-36 and includes 1-2 
items from each of eight health concepts :  physical functioning, role limitations due to physical 
health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role 
limitations due to emotional problems and menta l health (psychological distress and 
psychological well being).

services.   
 
•     Labor Force Participation  and Work Productivity will be assessed using standard 
questions used in other METRC studies. Participants will be asked what they were doing 
most of the time during th e previous two weeks.  If participants are working, the Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire will be administered.  The 
WPAI measures work time missed and work and activity impairment because of a specified 
health problem during t he past 7 days (for questionnaire: 
http://www.reillyassociates.net/WPAI_SHP.html) 71. The validity of the WPAI has been 
established in a number of diseases  72-73. In addition, the WPAI has proven a useful tool when 
measuring the relative difference between  treatment groups in clinical trials and in subjects 
with and without disease.  
 
•    Participation in Sports and Leisure Activities  will be assessed using the Paffenbarger 
Activity Scale  (PAS)  74. At T0 (baseline) and at T 4 (one year post fitting of the IDE O), 
patients are asked to  identify up to [ADDRESS_734158] 31, 2015  29 
 metabolic equivalents  (METS).  Activities will then be classified as light (< 3 METS) 
moderate  (3-6 METS) or vigorous (> 6 METS).   
 
•    Pain will be measured using the  Brief P ain Inventory (BPI ). The BPI [CONTACT_832] a widely used, 15 -
item measure of pain intensity and interference with daily life 76.  The questionnaire assesses 
three key pain domains: pain intensity, pain interference, and ef ficacy of pain treatments or 
medications. It has been extensively validated in both English and Spanish.  Overall  study 
limb as well as knee and ankle specific pain intensity will be measured using the [ADDRESS_734159] the type (grouped as acetaminophen, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], GABA analogues (like 
Neurontin or Lyrica), and NSAIDs (like Ibuprofen or Naproxen), and other) and frequency of 
pain medication use . 
 
•    Depressive Symptoms will be assessed using the nine item depression scale of  the Patient 
Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) 78.  The PHQ -9 is a well validated tool for assisting clinicians 
in diagnosing depression. There are two components of the PHQ -9: (1) assessing symptoms 
and functional impairment to make a tentative depression  diagnosis, and (2) deriving a 
severity score. The PHQ -9 is based directly on the diagnostic criteria for major depressive 
disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth  Edition (DSM -IV). 
 
•    Post Traumatic Stress (PTSD ) will be measured using the standard PTSD Checklist (PCL), 
a 17-item measure that elicits responses for each of the DSM -IV disorders that comprise the 
diagnostic criteria for PTSD (intrusive, avoidant, and  arousal symptoms)  79. The 
psychometric properties of the PCL have been well established and it is the most widely used 
measure of PTSD. Both civilian and military versions are available.   
   
• Use and Satisfaction with the IDEO and Related Services.  At T2 (following completion 
of the physical therapy program), and at T 3 and T4, each patient will complete a brief battery 
of questions to assess their use and overall satisfaction with the IDEOTM and related services. 
We will include both the Orthotics and Pro sthetics Users’ Survey (OPUS) 81-82 and elements 
of a survey developed at the Center for the Intrepid (designed specifically for comparing the 
satisfaction of the IDEO with other braces) 22.  The OPUS was developed by [CONTACT_558996]. using well establishe d contemporary measurement technology for instrument 
development. The OPUS consists of an 11 -item measure for satisfaction with devices  and a 
10-item measure for satisfaction with services .  Items pertaining to device satisfaction 
include:  weight, comfort , pain associated with use, ease of use, cosmesis, durability, fit and 
effect of the device on clothing (i.e., dimensions). Items used to measure satisfaction with 
services, include wait time, respect, communication, consumer’s input, team approach, and 
training with the device. Lastly, participants will be asked if they ever considered amputation 
of their injured limb, if so, why, and if they now favor limb salvage or amputation.

The PRIORITI intervention consists of two components: (1) custom fitting of the IDEO; and (2) 
the Return to Run  physical therapy program designed specifically for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_558966]. 
Each is described below together with specifics regarding the training of Study Site staff to 
ensure fidelity of the intervention across sites.  
 
All braces will be fabricated by [CONTACT_558997]/Orthotists (CPOs) at each 
participating MTF . Training for fabrication  of the IDEO is described below. The two 
participating study MTF sites will each identify 1 -2 physical therap y assistants  and 1  CPO and 1 
O&P  tech who will provide the services necessary for measuring, fabricating and fitting the 
IDEO and providing the PT.  Only PTAs and orthotists who have been trained for the study (see 
below) will be allowed to provide services to PRIORITI participants.   
 
7.[ADDRESS_734161] forces and cyclical 
loading.  The main components of the IDEO are the proximal cu ff, strut, and foot plate.  These 
components are described in further detail in Appendix J.  The IDEO is a class 1 exempt device.  
A provisional patent was filed in April, 2011 by [CONTACT_558998], CPO in conjunction with the 
[LOCATION_002] Government, as represented by [CONTACT_558999] (Application Serial No. 
61/518,801).   
 
The team at the Center for the Intrepid (CFI) will  train the CPOs from the other two military 
treatment facilities in IDEO fabrication. Training will consist of a 6 -8 week internship working 
with the San Antonio  team  to learn the processes of measurement, fabrication , and fitting of the 
brace. Training materials will be developed through this process and used in subsequent training 
sessions. Once able to replicate the process, the CPO s will return to WRNNMC and NMCSD  to 
implement the program  at their institutions    
 
7.2    Physical Therapy Protocol .   As indicated above, participants enrolled in PRIORITI will 
participate in the Return to Run  physical therapy regimen .  During Phase 1  (pre-IDEO) 
participants will engage in a home physical therapy program as prescribed by t he study team for  
2-4 weeks .  During Phase 2  (post -IDEO) , participants will receive [ADDRESS_734162],  the PTAs  will participate in bi -weekly  video 
conference calls together with [CONTACT_559017] at which time individual cases will be reviewed and 
difficulties in providing the PT and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_558967].  
 
 
8. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
 
The study will monitor and report adverse events to ensure patient safety. Definitions and 
procedures for reporting adverse events are designed to s atisfy 45 CFR Part 46, Subpart A; the 
“Common Rule”, shared by 17 Departments and Agencies as well as 21 CFR 312, the FDA 
regulation for adverse events.  The Common Rule requires written procedures and policies for 
ensuring reporting of “unanticipated prob lems” involving risks to participants to IRBs, 
appropriate institutional officials, and the Department or Agency Head.  
The medical monitor (MM) is responsible for providing medical guidance and overseeing patient 
safety for the study. The MM participates in determining the course of action necessary to meet 
safety goals and objectives.   This is achieved through the review of Serious Adverse Event 
reports; resolving safety issues; and interacting with Principal Investigators.  
Each participating site is resp onsible for ensuring that all local IRB requirements for reporting 
adverse events (both internal and external) are met.   
 
8.[ADDRESS_734163], including abnormal sign 
(e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated 
with the subject’s participation in the study, whether or not consider ed related to the subject’s 
participation.  
 
8.1.2 Unanticipated problem  
 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734164] 31, 2015  32 
 (1) is unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol and informed consent document and the 
characteristics of the patients eligible for the study.  
 
(2) is related or possibly related to treatment/procedures under study; possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that t he incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_246953].  
 
(3) suggests that the participation in the study may place subjects or others at a greater 
risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social  harm) than was 
previously known or recognized.  
 
Please note that not all adverse events are unanticipated problems and only some unanticipated 
problems are in fact adverse events.   For instance, if a laptop containing study data is stolen, this 
is an unan ticipated problem but it is not an adverse event since it is not an untoward or 
unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject  
 
8.1.3 Serious Adverse Event  
 
A serious adverse event is defined as:  
1. Death  
2. Unanticipated events related to rigor of participat ing in the Return 
to Run PT Program; or events related to IDEO brace fit or wear . 
3. Other events that are unexpected AND serious AND related or 
possibly related to the study  
 
8.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing, Managing Safety 
Parameters  
 
8.2.1 Methods and Timing of Assessment   
 
Adverse events may be discovered during regularly scheduled visits or through unscheduled 
patient contacts between visits.  Adverse events related to study procedures would  be assessed 
during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_246905].  They will be recorded on study data 
forms whether or not they are thought to be associated with the study.  
 
8.2.2 AE/SAE Grading and Relationship Assignment  
 
Adverse event grading:   Adverse events will be graded using standard criteria. The study 
physician will determine relationship of event to the study procedure .  
GRADE 1 (Mild) Transient or mild discomfort (< 48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy 
required  
  
 GRADE 2 (Moderate) Mild to moderate limitation in activity - some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
  
 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734165] 31, 2015  33 
  GRADE 3 (Severe) Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_558968] 4 (Life -threatening) Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required;  
significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27595].  
 
Relationship Assignment  The relationship of the adverse event to participation in the study will 
be assessed as either:  
  
Definitely related  
Probably related  
Possibly related  
Unlikely related  
Unrelated    
 
8.2.3 Reco rding and Documentation   
 
Sites will maintain source document s including but not limited to (laboratory and radiology 
reports, clinical notes and discharge summaries). After review of initial and final reports by [CONTACT_35041], the events may be reclassified at their discretion.  
 
8.2.4. Management of Adverse E vents  
 
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events will be managed according to protocol guidelines. If 
specific guidelines do not exist, AEs/SAEs will be managed according to the medical judgment 
of the treating physician.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_734166] always follow and comply with their own local institution’s adverse event 
reporting requirements, which may differ from those adopted by [CONTACT_559000] .  
Depending on the local requirements, a site may report events locally and not report those events 
to the METRC Coordinating Center. Each participating site is responsible for ensuring that all 
local IRB requirements for reporting adverse events (both inter nal and external) are met.   
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_734167] be reported to the Medical Monitor and METRC Coordinating Center with in 72 hours of

9. MONITORING  
 
9.1 Site Monitoring Plan  
 
The METRC Coordinating Center will be responsible for site monitoring consistent with 
ICH/FDA guidelines. Monitoring will include a combination of remote and on -site visits of 
participating clinical research sites to review the individual subject records, including consent 
forms, case report forms, supporting data, and medical records (physicians’ progress notes, 
nurses’ notes, individuals’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332]), to ensure protection of study subjects, compliance 
with the protocol, and accuracy and completeness of records. The monitors also will inspect 
sites’ regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements are being followed.   
 
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_44303] (e.g., consent forms, case report forms) and pertinent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112466], the site monitors, the 
DOD, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), or other regulatory authorities for 
confirmation of the study data.

of the PRIORITI program.   
 
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
A total of 85 patients wi ll be consented and enrolled by [CONTACT_559002] 
(approximately 25 -30 from each center); data collected from these participants will be used to 
test the research hypotheses.  
 
We anticipate a low dropout rate (<5%) because highly motivated i ndividuals  will self -select 
themselves into the program. We will also provide a modest compensation to participants who 
are not on active duty for their time and travel. For power calculations we assume we will have 
complete follow -up data on [ADDRESS_734175] for 
improvements in outcomes at a specified point in time after enrollment (8 weeks for Specific 
Aim 1a and 1 year for Specific Aims 2a and 2b) as compared to baseline. One -sided paired t -
tests will be used. Differences in means between follow -up and baseline will be reported along 
with 95% confidence intervals. The proposed sample size yields 80% power to detect an effect 
size (mean of the difference in outcomes between follow -up and baseline divided by [CONTACT_559003]) of 0.28 (a modest treatment effect). To put this effect size in 
perspective, Patzkowski et al., reports effect sizes for FSST, TSA, SSWV -L and 40D of 
approximately 0.6, 0.7, 1.0 and 1.0, respectively.   
 
Based on the above considerations, the targeted sample size for the study is 85 patients.    
 
10.3 Randomization  
 
N/A 
 
10.[ADDRESS_734176], 
we will:  
1. Limit participant burden and inconvenience in data colle ction  
2. Select high quality investigators  
3. Provide pre -study training of investigators as well as on -study reinforcement  
4. Reimburse investigators based on follow -ups completed not on per -patient basis.  
5. Monitor and report missing data rates during the study  
6. Emphasize the importance of full participation in the study during the consent 
process.  
7. Collect information on the reasons for missing data.  
8. Actively engage participants and educate them about the importance of participation  
9. Hold regular Protocol Committee  meetings to discuss strategies for follow -up    
10. Set targets for acceptable rates of missing data and terminate sites not meeting targets.  
 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734177] sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of 
the study results to various untestable assumptions about the missing data mechanism. In 
addition to unadjusted analyses, which rely on the missing completely at random assumption 
(testable), we will also estimate treatment effects (utilizing relevant auxiliary information) under 
the missing at random assumption. Further, we will explore the effect of departures from the 
missing at random assumption using pattern -mixture and selection modeling techniques.  
 
10.5 Planned Interim Analysis  
N/A 
 
10.[ADDRESS_734178]. Daniel 
Scharfstein and METRC’s senior economist, [CONTACT_559018].  
 
Specific Aims #1 and #2: Assessing Immediate and Long -term Improvements in Functional 
Performance and Self -Reported Outcomes. As described above, one -sided paired t -tests will be 
used to test for improvements in outcomes at a specified point in time after enrollment as 
compare d to baseline. Differences in means between follow -up and baseline will be reported 
along with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
 
To the extent possible, we will explore how improvement correlates with characteristics of the 
participants, the type and extent of their injury, baseline measures of impairment, and the percent 
of pre and post IDEO PT sessions attended (as we expect some variation in adherence to the PT 
regimen). Differences in improvement will be examined using stratified analyses and regressions 
where the change in outcomes is the dependent variable. We will also conduct the analysis 
including and excluding participants who complete less than 1/3 of the PT sessions.  
 
Specific Aim #3 : Documenting Patterns of Use and Satisfaction with the IDEO. This ai m is 
largely descriptive in nature. To the extent possible, patterns of use and satisfaction will be 
compared with other studies reported in the literature. Also, variations in device satisfaction will 
be modeled as a function of patient characteristics an d baseline measures of impairment using 
the appropriate regression techniques.  
 
Specific Aim #[ADDRESS_734179] of care 
(SOC), the PRIORITI program may increase or decrease costs of care. Provision of the ID EO 
device, the associated rehabilitation program, need for special shoe wear, and any adjustments, 
repairs or replacements needed during the lifetime of wear represent added costs relative to SOC. 
However, the PRIORITI program could potentially reduce cert ain types of resource use and costs 
relative to SOC. For example, if the IDEO device offers greater mobility (without use of 
ambulatory aids) or reduced pain, participants might decrease follow -up visits or use of pain 
medications relative to standard of c are. Use of the IDEO could also lead to fewer delayed 
amputations. Labor force participation, return to duty, and productivity of participants enrolled in 
 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734180] 31, 2015  39 
 the PRIORITI program could also improve relative to SOC and this has economic benefit from 
both the p atient and societal perspectives.  
 
Our analysis of the costs and benefits of PRIORITI will involve two components: (1) analysis of 
costs and outcomes as observed during the 12 -month study period; and (2) cost -effectiveness 
projected over the patient lifeti me. [ADDRESS_734181] per unit change in Short Form Musculoskeletal Function Ass essment (SMFA), 
or incremental cost per unit change in VR -12. 
 
Lifetime Cost -Effectiveness . If superior to standard care, the PRIORITI program could have a 
major impact on the patient’s long -term functional status and quality of life. To gain insight on 
this proposition, a cost -effectiveness model will be constructed that simulates the long -term 
course for two identical patient cohorts, IDEO and standard of care. Model parameters will be 
derived from the study data, literature review, and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. Ma rkov modeling will be used 
in order to characterize patient health state over time. For example, a small portion of patients 
who initially undergo limb reconstruction, later elect amputation. This would represent a change 
of “health state” in a Markov mode l and the probability of transition from the “limb 
reconstruction state” to “amputation state” will be derived from literature review. Similarly, 
patient preference (utility) for various health states associated with recovery from traumatic 
injury will als o estimated and used to calculate quality -adjusted life years, to be derived suing the 
VR-6D. Overall findings of this analysis will be stated in terms of incremental cost per quality 
adjusted life -year for PRIORITI relative to standard of care.   
 
 
11. QUA LITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
11.1 Data Quality Assurance  
 
Quality Control (Q/C) and Quality Assurance (Q/A) procedures that apply to all studies are 
outlined in the METRC Manual of Operations (MOP).  A certification process (also outlined in 
the MOP) will be used as a basis for training and certification of the study personnel involved in 
data collection.  In addition to consortium wide training and certification procedures, additional 
requirements may be added based on the nature of the study.  On going data edits and audits will 
be performed to ensure collection of quality data. The continuous and timely flow of data from 
the centers to the MCC is an essential prerequisite for maintaining data quality. Monthly 
enrollment reports  will be distributed  to each center that will summarize recruitment, data 
completion and timeliness of data entry. These reports will also include a set of q ueries generated 
by [CONTACT_559004] a ddress  these queries within [ADDRESS_734182] 31, 2015  40 
 All participating centers together with their respective study personnel will undergo certification 
that includes training, local site IRB, and a knowledge assessment on the study design and 
procedures.  Training will include on e-on-one brace fabrication training with each site’s 
designated CPO, RTR program training with each site’s designated study PTA. In addition, the 
research coordinators will receive training related to protocol submission, participant 
recruitment, study imp lementation, and data collection at the site level .  
 
12. ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
12.1 IRB/Ethics Committee  
 
IRB approval will be obtained from the MCC at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public 
Health, the DoD, and each participating clinical site according to METRC policies and 
procedures.  Sites that recruit patients will submit METRC study  recruitment materials to their 
organization’s IRB prior to use  at that facility . 
 
Sites must provide the Coordinating Center with a copy of the initial IRB approval notice and 
subseque nt renewals as well as copi[INVESTIGATOR_246911].  
No site can begin work related to this study until the site has been certified by [CONTACT_246968].  
 
12.2 Exclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children (Special Populations)  
 
The proposed study anticipates recruiting a significant proportion of racial/ethnic minorities 
(African -Americans, Asian -Americans and Hispanics) as well as non -Hispanic white subjects.  
The study will not include children or prisoners . 
 
12.3 Participant Confidentiality  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to conduct the protocol under the current version of 
Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Guidelines, Good Clinical Practice, and rules of local IRBs. The 
investigator must ensure that the patient’s anonymity be maintained in their data submission to 
the Data Coordinating Center.  
 
Patients will be identified only by [CONTACT_108444], SSN, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_558969] d number. Study Site Investigators will maintain a separate confidential enrollment 
log, which matches identifying codes with the patients’ names and addresses available only to

13.1 Data Management Responsibilities  
 
Instructions concerning the recording of study data on case report forms will be provided by [CONTACT_246970] . Each study site is responsible for transmitting the data in a timely fashion.  
 
The research coordin ators at each site will obtain the information necessary to complete the case 
report forms (CRFs) from several sources including but not limited to, the patient's medical 
record, clinical evaluations and patient interviews. These forms will NOT contain the  patient’s 
name, SSN, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15168]; they will be identified only by a unique patient -
specific study number.    
 
The Site Research Coordinator will enter non -personally identifiable information into a central 
and secured web -based data management system being implemented for all Consortium studies, 
known as REDCap. This data management system has incorporated state -of-the-art features for 
electronic data collection and is configured in accordance with best practices for information 
technology and research data management.   
 
All research data, in hard copy or electronic form, will be stored and managed in a secure 
manner following applicable federal regulations and  ICH guidelines and according to 
institutional policies and practices. Hard copy documents containing subject data , patient 
identifiers and contact [CONTACT_559005] , locked  containers (fil e cabinets, 
drawers, etc.) in accordance with standard document management practices.  
 
At all times only MCC -certified  key personnel specifically designated and authorized by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_246913], including electronic 
data and medical records .  All such personnel will be properly trained and supervised regarding 
the management and handling of confidential materials. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_246914], supervisio n, and conduct.   This information will be available for 
audit by [CONTACT_246972], the MCC, the DOD, and the OHRP.

 Report Forms (CRFs ), which  will serve as source documents for the study. Source documents , 
which will include both the CRFs and other supporting medical records (e.g radiology reports, 
clinical notes and discharge summaries), will be signed b y PI, other site Investigator, or Research 
Coordinator as indicated in the CRF instructions . The Resear ch Coordinator or an MCC -certified 
staff member working under the supervision of the research coordinator, will enter the data from 
the CRFs into the REDCAP database.  
 
13.3 Types of Data  
 
Data will include medical and surgical histories, radiology reports , clinical evaluations, 
performance assessments, adverse events and patient interviews . 
 
13.4 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents  
 
Source documents including CRFs, radiographic reports, patient surveys, medical records, etc. 
will be maintained at the site and will be made available to study monitors, and representatives 
of regulatory agencies including the MCC, DOD,  IRB, and OHRP.

13.6 Protocol Deviations  
 
Records of protocol deviations will be noted on the Protocol Deviation CRF (AF05)  with the 
reason for the deviation recorded, as well as any action taken to mitigate the deviation. This 
information will be entered into REDCap. These records will be provided to the site’s IRB in 
accordance with local reporting requirements and be made available to s tudy monitors.

 APPENDIX D: CONSENT TEMPLATE  
INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT  
 
Participant  Consent Form  
Study Title:  Patient Response to an Integrated Orthotic and Rehabilitation Initiative for 
Traumatic Injuries (PRIORITI -MTF)  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_558972], PhD  
IRB No.:  00005172  
PI [CONTACT_214292]:  Version 6; 12/05/[ADDRESS_734225] on your medical care.  You can 
choose not to take part and if you join, you may quit at any time.  Ask the study doctor or the study 
staff to explain any words or procedures  that you do not clearly understand.  Ask as many 
questions as needed.  All of your questions should be answered to your satisfaction before you sign 
this form.  
 
 
1. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY?  
 
This research is being done to help determine whether a new type of custom designed brace along 
with a physical therapy program improves your physical function. Further, the study is a clinical 
investigation to evaluate the effectiveness of an investigational FDA -regulated medical device.  
The device being used in this study is the IDEO brace. Because we are testing this device in the 
study, it will be labeled with the following information: “CAUTION --Investigational device. Limited 
by [CONTACT_44505] .”  
 
This brace was d eveloped for wounded warriors who wanted to return to an active lifestyle. Early 
studies showed that wounded warriors who received the brace and participated in the physical 
therapy program had better function than before they had the brace. The purpose of  this study is to 
see if the brace along with therapy will improve function and return to usual activities in people 
with lower leg, ankle or foot injuries like yours.   
This PRIORITI  study is funded by [CONTACT_2315] (DOD) and is being carried o ut in 
three M ilitary Treatment Facilities that are taking care of service members who are injured in the 
line of duty.  
 
 
 
 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734226] 31, 2015  53 
 2. WHY AM I BEING ASKED TO PARTICIPATE?  
 
You are being asked to participate in this study because you had a traumatic injury of the lower leg 
at least [ADDRESS_734227]?  
 
Your participation in the study will be expected for one year.  
 
4. HOW DOES THE STUDY WORK?  
After you review this informed consent and agree to be part of the study, the following things will 
happen:  
• You will be asked questions about you and the activities you do now. These questions 
could take up to 15 minutes to answer.  
• Information will be collected about  your injury and the care you received for your injury. A 
member of the research team will enter  this information into a database . 
• You will receive a clinical assessment to measure in your leg weakness and how well you 
can bend your foot. The assessment could take up to 15 minutes.  
 
If the surgeon feels that you are still eligible based on the clinical assessment you will be 
scheduled to return to the clinic to begin the PRIORITI program that includes up to 8 weeks of 
physical therapy (PT) sessions. Each week for the first 2-4 weeks, you will receive a home 
physical therapy program as prescribed by [CONTACT_3476]. The length of the home physical therapy 
program is dependant on the time required to fabricate the IDEO™. In addition, you will be fitted 
for the brace. Before the first PT s ession, you will be asked to complete several performance tests 
to measure your current physical performance. Performance testing at each interval below could 
take up to 30 minutes of your time. A member of the research team will time you to see how long 
it takes for you to:  
• walk the length of a long hallway  
• repeatedly rise from a chair  
• climb a set of stairs  
• balance on one foot  
• change direction while steppi[INVESTIGATOR_181898] a small obstacle  
• run or walk as fast as possible between two cones  
 
During the first [ADDRESS_734228] fitting, prior to 
receiving the completed IDEO™.  , After you receive the IDEO™  you will be asked to come back 
to the study center for [ADDRESS_734229] used.  
 
During the final study visit  at 12 months following completion of the PRIORITI program, you will 
be asked to r eturn to the study center and complete the performance tests one more time and 
answer questions about your function and satisfaction with the brace. This could take up to 45 
minutes of your time.  
 
5. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS?  
 
There is a small possibility that you may injure yourself during the PT sessions. These sessions 
will be performed under close supervision by a trained physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_558973].  
 
There also may be a small risk of fal ling during the performance tests. The tests are given in order 
of difficulty. If you can’t perform the tests of lower difficulty, you will not be asked to perform 
more difficult tests. If you don’t feel comfortable doing any of the tests, you can stop at any time.   
 
There is also a chance that your function and quality of life may not improve. This may be 
disappointing to you.  
 
Any time information is collected for a study there is a small risk of breach of confidentiality. As 
described below, your resear ch data will be identified by a unique study number rather than your 
name [CONTACT_559011] [CONTACT_559007].  
 
 In this study, you will be exposed to a small amount of radiation called "ioniz ing radiation," which 
is like x -rays. Studies have shown that getting a lot of radiation at one time or getting many small 
doses over time may cause cancer. The risk of getting cancer from the one small radiation dose in 
this study is very small.  
 
Tell us now if you have been in other research studies where you had ionizing radiation. Also tell 
us if you have been exposed to radiation in other ways, like on your job or in radiation therapy.  
 
What if you are pregnant? If you are pregnant or nursing,  you cannot be in this research study 
because the radiation may harm your baby.  
 
 
6. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS?  
 
PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734230] this same injury in the future.  
 
 
 
7. DO I GET ANY PAYMENT FOR BEING IN THE STUDY?  
 
Active duty military personnel will not be paid to participate in the study.  
 
If you are not on active military duty you will receive a total of $300 for your participation in the 
study.  The $300 will be provided to you according to the following schedule : 
 
• $50 at the time you enroll in the study and complete the baseline assessments.  
• $75 when you complete  the home  physical therapy (prior to receiving the IDEO™)  
• $75 when you complete  the 4 weeks of physical therapy  (after receiving the IDEO™)   
• $100 when y ou complete the final assessment at 12 months  
 
 
8. ARE THERE ANY COSTS INVOLVED IN BEING IN THE STUDY?  
 
There is no cost to you to participate in this study.  You will not be charged for the brace or the 
physical therapy. You will not be charged for additional visits to the orthotist during the study 
period if you have problems with the brace.

Help advance limb trauma care through research . 
 
What is the PRIORITI -MTF Study?  
The goal of the PRIORITI -MTF study is to help determine whether a new type of custom designed 
brace, called the IDEO ™ along with a physical the rapy program, called Return to Run, improves 
your physical function.  
 
Why me?  
The PRIORITI -MTF study is funded by [CONTACT_2315] (D oD) and is being carried out 
in three Military Treatment Facilities  across the [LOCATION_002] that are taking care  of service 
members who were  injured in the line of duty.  
 
You are being asked to participate in this study because you had a traumatic injury of the lower leg 
at least 1 year ago and you are still limited in the activities you are able to do.  Service mem bers 
with injuries like yours  from around the co untry  are being asked to participate.  
 
How does the study work?  
If you are eligible for the study and agree to participate,  the following things will happen:  
• You will be asked questions about you and the activities you do now.  
• Information will be collected about  your injury and the care you received for your injury. 
This information  will be entered into a database by a member of the research team.  
• You will receive a clinical assessment to measure your leg weakness and how well you can 
bend your foot.  
• You will be measured for the IDEOTMbrace and begin a home physical  therapy (PT) 
program while the IDEO™  is being made . 
• You will be fitted for the IDEO™ and will participate in 4 weeks of physical therapy with 
the brace.  
• You will be asked to participate in performance testing at several intervals: at baseline, 
after the 4 week Return to Run PT program and at one year following completion of the 
program.  At these times we will also ask you questions about your f unctioning and 
satisfaction with the device.  
• After the end of the program, the IDEO™ is yours to keep.   
 
We hope you will consider taking part in the PRIORITI -MTF Study.   It is a way to be part of a 
nationwide effort to help advance limb trauma care for others in the future.  Please talk to your 
doctor about participating, or email us at prioriti -[EMAIL_10603] .  You can also visit

Appendix H: Sample Letter from Physicians to potential participants:  
 
Dear (Colleague)  
 
I am reaching out to you to give you some information about a study that is being done locally that 
could impact some of your patient s. The research is being done to help determine whether a new 
type of custom designed brace called the IDEO along with an intense physical therapy program 
called the Return to Run Program improves your patient ’s physical function. The IDEO was 
devel oped for wounded warriors who want to return to an active lifestyle, including active duty.  
The study is for patients who have had an injury to their lower leg and are one or more years out 
from their injury. We are looking for patients with unilateral in juries who are healed (will not 
require further surgeries within the next 6 months) and able to fully bear weight.  They must also 
meet the following criteria:  
Evidence of either : 
• Weakness of ankle dorsiflexors and /or plantarflexors resulting from leg inj ury 
(defined as less than [ADDRESS_734239])  
• Limited ankle dorsiflexion (< 10 degrees) and /or limited ankle plantarflexion (< 20 
degrees) resulting from leg injury  
• Mechanical pain with loading to hindfoot/midfoot (>= 50 mm on a 0 -100 mm vi sual 
analogue scale assessing average daily pain)  
• Ankle or h indfoot fusion or candidate for ankle or hindfoot fusion  
• Candidate for amputation secondary to ankle/foot impairment  
 
If you feel that you have patients who meet the above criteria, please provi de them with the 
enclosed brochure and contact [CONTACT_3031]. You may also refer them to our website: www.prioriti -
mtf.org . If you have questions please feel free to reach out to me (Site PI [CONTACT_2300]) or (Site PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_558976])  using the following contact [CONTACT_3031] (phone number, email) .  You can also

Appendix I: Study Video [DRAFT]  
Narrative      Suggestions for Visuals  
You are watching this video because you had a bad 
injury to your lower leg one or more years ago. 
Although this type of injury is rare in everyday life, 
it is quite common among members of the military. 
For this reason, the [LOCATION_002] Department of 
Defense is funding research to help us determine 
the best way to treat these injur ies. The goal of this 
research is to help wounded service members  and 
veterans  like you recover from  severe leg injuries 
and return to the activities  they enjoy doing . We are 
asking you to consider participating in this research 
today to help others like y ou in the future.  
The name [CONTACT_559015]. This video will give you more information to 
help you decide if you would like to participate in 
the study.  
The goal of the PRIORITI study is to evaluate the 
benefits of a new brace for the lower leg. This 
brace is called the Intrepid Dynamic Exoskeletal 
Orthosis or the IDEO brace.

Right now there are braces called ankle foot 
orththoses, or AFO’s, that have been made for 
people with different needs. They provide support 
to the ankle where there might be weakness.  Most 
of these braces , however, are static or have no 
moving parts.  
Other braces, like the IDEO brace, have been made 
to provide support but also incorporate a strut that 
acts as a spring. The strut is intended to act as an 
energy storing device, which  is meant to help 
provide a balance of power in the muscles of the Images of braces

PRIORITI -MTF  Protocol v 8.[ADDRESS_734241] 
in increasing the speed and quality with which you 
can walk and return to vigorous  activities like 
running.   
 
This brace was developed by a team at the Center 
for the Intre pid in San Antonio, TX 
Some research has been done using the brace along 
with a physical therapy program called the Return 
to Run or RTR program. The multidisciplinary 
Return to Run (RTR) clinical pathway focuses on 
strength, agility and speed with the goal of enabling 
patients to return to running, sports and military 
deployment.  
For the purpose of this study, we would like to re -
create this progr am and test it closer to where you 
live. This is why we need people like you to 
participate. We would like to further evaluate the 
IDEO brace along with the RTR program outside 
the place where it was created.  
ENTER DR X.   
You are being asked to participa te in the PRIORITI 
study because your doctor has determined that you  
could potentially benefit from wearing the IDEO . 
The type of injury you sustained is fairly 
uncommon, so the study’s success depends on 
people with injuries like yours from major trauma 
centers across the country joining together to take 
part in this effort.  
If you choose to participate in this study you will 
be asked to do the following :  
Step 1: To determine if you can be in the study  
• You will be asked questions about you and 
the activ ities you do now  
• Information will be collected about your 
injury and the care you received for your 
injury. This information will be entered 
into a database by a member of the 
research team.  Images of CTI, Ryan, Etc?

 • You will receive a clinical assessment to 
measure in your leg wea kness and how 
well you can bend your ankle.  
 
Step 2: The Study Itself  
If the surgeon feels that you are eligible based on 
the clinical assessment you will be scheduled to 
return to the clinic to begin the PRIORITI program. 
The program includes 8 weeks of p hysical therapy 
(PT) sessions …. [ADDRESS_734243] PT session, you will be asked to 
complete several performance tests to measure your 
current physical performance. A member of the 
research team will also time you to see how long it

• repeatedly rise from a chair  
• climb a set of stairs  
• balance on one foot  
• change direction while steppi[INVESTIGATOR_181898] a

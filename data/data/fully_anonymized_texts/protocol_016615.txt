Postoperative follow up is necessary following any surgical procedure and has been conducted in the same manner 
since the field of surgery b egan. We will determine feasibility and patient satisfaction of innovative postoperative 
virtual clinical encounters utilizing mobile video conference technology for women undergoing pelvic 
reconstructive surgery through a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome will be patient satisfaction after 
their 4 to 6 week (30 day) postoperative visit. We will also study 30 -day and 90 -day re -admission rates, unplanned 
visits to the emergency room and clinic.  
 
Overall objectives  
The primary objective of th e study is to determine if postoperative virtual clinical encounters via mobile video 
conference technology are non -inferior to traditional postoperative office visits at 30 -days following surgery in 
terms of patient satisfaction. Secondary objectives incl ude utilization of emergency room visits, readmissions, 
postoperative complications, unscheduled office visits and telephone encounters with the provider's office at 30 - and 
90-days following surgery.  
 
Primary outcome variable  
Patient satisfaction as dete rmined by [CONTACT_653380] -18 (PSQ -18). 
 
Secondary outcome variable(s)  
1. Emergency room  utilization  in the 30 - and 90 -day postoperative period  
2. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_356122] 30 - and 90 -day postoperative period  
3. Unscheduled offi ce visits in the 30 - and 90 -day postoperative period  
4. Telephone encounters with medical providers in the 30 - and 90 -day postoperative period  
5. Postoperative complications  
6. Efficiency: measured by [CONTACT_801111] (time in waiting room, time in exam room and 
time with provider)  
 
Study Design  
Design  
This will be a prospective randomized control study comparing postoperative virtual clinical encounters versus 
traditional in -office postoperative visits in women undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery. The postoperative 
experiences of both groups will b e assessed via surveys.  
 
Virtual Clinical Encounter Group:  
- Receive video -conference call from office nurse [ADDRESS_1105831] discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
- Receive video -conference call from fellow and/or attending physician approximately [ADDRESS_1105832] in -office postoperative visit with fellow and/or attending physician approximately 90 days  from surgery  
 
Traditional Office Group:   
- Receive telephone call from offi ce nurse [ADDRESS_1105833] in -office postoperative visit with fellow and/or attending physician approximately [ADDRESS_1105834] in -office postoperat ive visit with fellow and/or attending physician approximately 90 days from surgery  
 
Study duration  
In the division of urogynecology there are approximately 30 -40 pelvic reconstructive surgical procedures a month 
(approximately [ADDRESS_1105835] year). We aim to start recruiting patients as 
soon as possible and estimate that we will need approximately 4 months to recruit the 50 patients for the study (25 in 
the virtual clinical encounter group and 25 in the traditiona l office group). Once the last patient is enrolled, data 
collection on the study would be completed after 3 months (a total of 7 months to complete data collection on the 
study). A subject's participation in the study will conclude [ADDRESS_1105836] year, the combined surgical volume of these cases at our clinical sites was approximately 500 subjects; thus, we 
anticipate we will be able to easily recruit the proposed sample size in 4 months. We plan to re cruit women from 2 
clinical sites in the University of Pennsylvania Health System: 1) Urogynecology at Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_659717] (HUP) and 2) Urogynecology at Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (PAH). Physician investigators are present at 
all three sites,  and will have opportunities to screen patients planning for surgery for pelvic organ prolapse for 
participation.

Procedures  
RECRUITMENT AND PREOPERATIV E PERIOD: We plan to recruit women from 2 clinical sites associated with 
the University of Pennsylvania Health System: 1) Urogynecology at Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117757] (HUP) 
and 2) Urogynecology at Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (PAH). All patients will f ill out the Patient Technical Qualifying 
Checklist to verify that they meet the technical requirements needed for participation in the study. If the patient is 
not currently enrolled in My Penn Medicine or does not currently have the MyChart mobile applica tion downloaded 
onto their smartphone, then the trained office staff at the clinical sites will assist the patient in obtaining these 
requirements for participation. Physician investigators, who are present at all sites, will screen patients planning for 
surgery for pelvic organ prolapse for participation. Following confirmation of eligibility, the physicians will obtain 
informed consent prior to surgery at the planned preoperative visit. The combined annual surgical volume at our two 
clinical sites (four s urgeons) is approximately 500 subjects; thus, we anticipate we will be able to easily recruit the 
proposed sample size in seven months.  
 
ENROLLMENT AND PERIOPERATIVE PERIOD: After informed consent has been signed, the patients will be 
randomized to either  postoperative virtual clinical encounters (VCE) via videoconference technology or traditional 
in-office post -operative visits using sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes  following a blocked 
randomization schedule . The patient will undergo their planned surgery, if there are any surgical complications from 
surgery that warrant in -office visits, those patients randomized to virtual clinical encounters will be removed from 
the study and undergo the current standard of care with in -office postoperati ve visits. If there are no complications 
from surgery then the following follow up encounters will occur for the two groups . 
 
 
 
 
 
POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD: As per standard of care, all subjects will be scheduled for a nursing clinical encounter 
48-[ADDRESS_1105837] script which reviews the following key aspects of postoperative care: bowel functions, 
voiding functions, presence of vaginal bleeding, pain control, diet status,  ambulatory status and any additional 
concerns. Standard postoperative instructions and precautions are reviewed as well. At the end of this nursing 
encounter, the office nurse will schedule the patient for a 30-day postoperative visit. This will either be  a VCE or an 
in-office visit, depending on the subject’s  randomization. These encounters are documented in the electronic 

medical system. If at any time the patient who is randomized to VCEs no longer desires to be in the VCE group, an 
in-office appointmen t will be scheduled for them by [CONTACT_801113].  
 
On the scheduled day of the 30-day postoperative visit the VCE group will conduct their visit via the 
videoconference section of the MyChart mobile applications with the clinical fellow and /or their surge on. The 
traditional group will have their in -office visit with the clinical fellow and /or their surgeon. Both encounters will be 
conducted according to a standard ized script. Subjects will all be offered a physical exam if desired. If a subject in 
the VCE group desires a pelvic exam, then they will be offered to come into the clinic on the next following 
business day. These encounters are documented in the electronic medical system.  
 
Demographic information will be collected from the patient’s  medical record (age, ethnicity, level of education, 
medical comorbidities, and duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Data regarding the patient’s  surgical intervention (procedure 
type, surgical complications, operative time) will be collected from the operative r ecord. Within [ADDRESS_1105838] will receive a telephone call from the research staff and a phone survey of 
the study questionnaires will be conducted .  
 
All patients will be scheduled for an in -office visit for their 90-day postoperative visit. On the scheduled day of the 
90-day postoperative visit the visit will be conducted by [CONTACT_801114] /or their surgeon. This will be 
conducted according to a standard ized script. All subjects will receive a physical exam . This encounter is 
documented in the electronic medical system.  
 
Analysis Plan  
All analyses w ill be  conducted using an intent -to-treat principle. Data between groups w ill be  analyzed using two -
sample t -tests, Wilcoxon rank -sum tests, Pearson chi -square and Fisher’s exact tests , as appropriate.  Non-inferiority 
will be determined by [CONTACT_801115]-[ADDRESS_1105839]'s pre operative  office 
visit. The patient may choose to withdraw from the study at any time. Investigators will emphasize that participation 
(or lack of p articipation) in the study: 1) will not influence their evaluation, care, or treatment 2) is completely 
voluntary 3) does not involve any financial compensation 4) may be terminated at any time. Layman terms will be 
used by [CONTACT_295926]. The  consent will be written at a 6th grade reading level. All questions will be 
answered to the patient's satisfaction and understanding before informed consent is obtained.

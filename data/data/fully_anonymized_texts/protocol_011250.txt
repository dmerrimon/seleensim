January 3, 2022       Page 4 of 23  2.0  OBJECTIVES  
  
2.1  Primary Objective  
  
To determine the probability of long -term disease -free survival in patients with JMML treated with 
busulfan (BU), cyclophosphamide (CY) and melphalan (L -PAM) followed by [CONTACT_551445].  
  
2.2  Secondary Objectives  
  
To determine:  
  
1. probability of engraftment  
2. incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft -versus -host disease (GVHD)  
3. incidence of regimen -related toxicity  
4. incidence of relapse  
  
  
3.0  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
  
JMML is a rare myeloproliferative disease of very young children (age <4 years), accounting for less 
than 2% of childhood leukemias.  Approximately [ADDRESS_724522] that isotretinoin may benefit a proportion of children with JMML; 
however, its potential to affect long term survival is unclear.6,[ADDRESS_724523].8-21  
  
Aricò et al (1997) reviewed the outcome of [ADDRESS_724524] in 16 different 
reports.3  Thirty -eight patients (41%) were still alive at time of reporting, including 30 of the 60 
(50%) patients who received grafts from HLA -matched or one -antigen mismatched familial donors, 2 
of 12 ( 17%) with mismatched donors, and 6 of 19 (32%) with matched unrelated donors.  Transplant 
results reported from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Sanders et al, 1988) and recently updated 
(Smith et al, 1994) include 27 children with JMML treated with prep arative regimens that included 
dimethylbusulfan, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and/or TBI followed by [CONTACT_551446].8-10  
Unmodified marrow was obtained from HLA -identical siblings (n=10), family members differing by 
1, 2, or 3 antigens (n=14), or HLA minor -mismatched unrelated donors (n=3).  Graft -versus -host 
disease (GVHD) prophylactic regimens included the use of methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine  
(CSA), anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG), steroids, and anti -T cell antibodies.  Acute GVHD (grades 
IIIV) occurred in 50% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551431] 76% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551432].  Six patients died within the first  three months from graft rejection 
(n=1), fungal infection (n=1), or interstitial pneumonia (n=4).  Two patients developed secondary 
malignancies, one with myelodysplasia at one year, and one with a fatal chondrosarcoma at 17 years.  
MT1999 -20  
January 3, 2022       Page 5 of 23  Recurrent leukemia occ urred in ten patients from 1.6 to 56 (median 2.8) months and nine have died.  
Seven patients underwent a second transplant for relapse of disease or graft rejection.  None of these 
patients survived.  While the numbers of patients are small, there was no a pparent association 
between the type of preparative regimen, degree of HLA disparity, pre -transplant chemotherapy or 
pre-transplant splenectomy and survival.  Five patients survive disease -free (DFS) from 2.7 -10 
(median 7.3) years.  Cumulative incidence es timates of non -relapse mortality and relapse at five years 
are 44% and 49%, respectively, with a Kaplan -Meier estimate of DFS at five years of 25%.  
  
Six bone marrow transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551433] (1992).12  These children 
receive d T-cell depleted bone marrow grafts (using T10B9 monoclonal antibody plus complement) 
from HLA -mismatched related donors or HLA -matched unrelated marrow donors after a preparative 
regimen of busulfan, cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide, methylpredniso lone and 
hyperfractionated TBI.  GVHD prophylaxis was with CSA.  All patients engrafted with acute GVHD 
< grade II in all patients.  Two patients died of infection with one patient relapsing on day +939.  
Three of six patients were disease -free survivors a t days 180+, 1610+, and 2400+ at the time of the 
report.  
  
Twelve children with JMML, 5 of whom also had Monosomy 7, underwent transplantation in Paris.16  
Seven patients were recipi[INVESTIGATOR_551434], 4 from mismatched related donors and one 
from a matched unrelated donor.  Conditioning regimens were different for all patients, consisting of 
chemotherapy +/ - TBI.  In the matched sibling recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s, five engrafted after chemotherapy 
conditioning.  Two patients failed to engraft, one having received chemotherapy alone, the other 
having had chemotherapy and TBI as conditioning.  Long -term remission was achieved in three 
patients and two others are in  remission [ADDRESS_724525] with marrow 
from mismatched related donors failed in five patients because of graft failure in 3 patients and 
relapse in two.  One patient engrafted well after receiving a chemotherapy regimen and a ma tched 
unrelated donor transplant and remains in remission.  
  
The European Working Group on Myelodysplastic Syndrome in Childhood (EWOG -MDS) report on 
[ADDRESS_724526].20  Eight of these patients also had Monosomy 7.  
Twenty -two pati ents were given TBI and chemotherapy, which included cyclophosphamide.  Twenty 
one patients were conditioned with busulfan in combination with cytoxan alone, or with etoposide, or 
melphalan.  Six of the total 43 patients (14%), [ADDRESS_724527] from an alternative donor, 
failed to engraft.  GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CSA alone, MTX alone, both of these agents, or 
both agents with anti -thymocyte globulin or monoclonal antibodies.  One child received T -cell 
depleted marrow.  Grade II to IV acute GVHD  occurred in eight of 24 patients (33%) transplanted 
from HLA -identical siblings or one -antigen -mismatched relatives and in eight of 13 patients (62%) 
given HCT from other HLA -partially matched family donors or unrelated donors.  Transplant related 
mortali ty was 20% for the entire group, 9% for children given HCT from HLA -identical/one -
antigendisparate relatives, and 46% for patients transplanted using other HLA -partially matched 
family donors or mismatched unrelated donors.  Twenty -two (58%) children relap sed, at a median of 
3.[ADDRESS_724528].  The 5 year Kaplan -Meier DFS for the entire cohort of patients was 31 
  7%.  
The actuarial probability of DFS for children transplanted from HLA -partially matched family donors 
or unrelated volunteers was 22 +/ - 10% whereas the DFS for children given HCT from an 
MT1999 -20  
January 3, 2022       Page 6 of 23  HLAidentical sibling or one -antigen disparate relative was 38 +/ - 10%.  A shorter interval between 
diagnosis and HCT was associated with improved DFS probability.  Patients who received 
chemotherapy alone pr eparative regimen had a better EFS compared to those treated with a TBI 
containing regimen (48 ± 11% vs 15 ± 8%, p <.05).  
  
At the University of Minnesota, seven children, [ADDRESS_724529] blood (UCB) afte r a preparative 
regimen of cyclophosphamide and TBI, with the addition of busulfan in two cases.  Six patients 
engrafted without difficulty; primary graft failure occurred in one patient who required two further 
HCT to achieve engraftment.  Six patients re lapsed post HCT, at a median of 67 days, four of whom 
subsequently died.  One relapsed patient achieved a second sustained remission after CSA was 
abruptly withdrawn to induce graft -versus -leukemia (GVL).  Two patients are in remission more than 
[ADDRESS_724530].  
  
As JMML affects only very young children, preparative regimens which avoided radiation -induced 
long term sequelae, such as growth retardation and neuropsychological impairment were developed.  
A conditioning regimen consisting of three alkylating agents, busulfan, cyclophosphamide and 
melphalan has been shown to be effective in patients with JMML.  Results from the European Group 
(EWOG -MDS) showed that in the group of children given BMT from an HLA -identical sibling or 
one-antigen -disparate related donor, patients given busulfan had a lower risk of relapse (38 +/ - 13% 
vs 78 +/ - 17%), which resulted in a significantly better EFS in comparison to those treated with TBI  
  
(62% vs 11%).[ADDRESS_724531] been shown t o be quite variable, presumably due to  marked 
differences in absorption and/or clearance.22  In addition, there is some suggestion that increased 
plasma levels may relate to enhanced toxicity, while inadequate levels may be associated with graft 
failure.23  The recent availability of an intravenous form of the drug may result in decreased variation 
of the pharmacokinetics of the drug.24  The drug has been tested in children using a dose of 0.8 
mg/kg; however, it was determined that in children less than 4 years of age the clearance was more 
rapid and in this population a dose of 1.0 mg/kg will be used.[ADDRESS_724532] may 
promote GVL and prevent early relapse.  
  
4.0  TREATMENT SCHEMA  
  
This is a phase II single arm trial to evaluate the efficacy of busulfan, cyclophosphamide and 
melphalan and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in the treatment of JMML. This study 
will not be able to determine if pre -transplant chemotherapy or splenectomy is efficacious, nor will it 
MT1999 -20  
January 3, 2022       Page 7 of 23  identify a superior stem cell source.  The intent of this proposal is to provide a common protocol that 
will use unmanipulated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells from related and unrelated donors after a 
common prep arative regimen.  Results will be compared to prior reports using cyclophosphamide and 
total body irradiation after which the probability of engraftment, toxicity, and event free survival are  
50-97%, 9 -28% and 38 -50% after sibling donor BMT and 50 -65%, 46 -67%, and 17 -22% after 2 - to  
3-antigen disparate relative or unrelated donor BMT.10,16,19

***  Infusion over [ADDRESS_724533] occurred following 
high dose busulfan, all patients will be treated with levetiracetam (Keppra) per institutional 
guidelines.. Busulfan area under the curve (AUC) analyses will be calculated in -house per 
MT1999 -20  
January 3, 2022       Page 8 of 23  University of Minnesota BMT SOC guidelines. Busulfan therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) 
will be used to target a cumulative exposure for the entire course cAUC=68 -76 mg*hr/L 
(target 72 mg*hr/L). Results of TDM performed with the firs t dose will inform subsequent 
dosing. Refer to busulfan SOC for sample collection process, busulfan results reporting and 
TDM procedures.    
    
 4.1.3  Cyclophosphamide   
  
Cyclophosphamide is to be given as a 2 hour intravenous infusion. Mesna 60 mg/kg an d IV 
hydration will be administered per institutional guidelines. Cyclophosphamide dosing is 
calculated based on actual weight (ABW) unless ABW is >150% above Ideal Body Weight 
(IBW) per institutional guidelines.    
  
 4.1.4  Melphalan   
  
Melphalan is to b e given as a 15 minute infusion on day -1. For children < 10 kg, melphalan 
dosing will be 4.67 mg/kg IV x 1 dose.    
  
4.1.5 Antithymocyte Globulin - equine (ATG)   
  
ATG 30 mg/kg/day IV over [ADDRESS_724534]  
blood (UCB) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190852] .  
  
Pre-medications will be administered 30 minutes prior to each dose of ATG including:  
• acetaminophen (10 mg/kg orally; maximum dose 500 mg)  
• diphenhydramine (1 mg/kg IV or PO; maximum dose 50 mg)  
• methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg IV; maximum dose 125 mg)  
  
4.2 Hematopoietic Stem Cell Source  
  
Acceptable stem cell sources include: HLA -matched related or unrelated donor bone marrow (6/6 or 
5/6 antigen match) and related or unrelated donor umbilical cord bloo d (6/6, 5/6 or 4/6 match).  
HLAmatch is determined by [CONTACT_551447] I antigens (HLA A, B) and high resolution DNA 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_551436] (DRB1) unless parental typi[INVESTIGATOR_147136] (DR is satisfactory).  The stem cell 
source will not be manipulated (T -cell depletion, CD34+ cell selection, etc.).  Cord blood units 
selected for transplantation as per institutional guidelines.  
  
  
4.[ADDRESS_724535] Disease Prophylaxis  
  
GVHD prophylaxis will be as per University of Minnesota GVHD prophylaxis protocols.   
  
All patients (regardless of allograft source) will receive tacrolimus therapy beginning on day –3.    
  
MT1999 -20  
January 3, 2022       Page 9 of 23  Tacrolimus dosing will be monitored and altered as clinically appropriate per institutional pharmacy 
guidelines.  Dose adjustments will be made on the b asis of toxicity and/or low tacrolimus levels.   
  
Tacrolimus taper begins at day +100 or 1 month after control of GVHD.  Taper to zero by 10% 
weekly dose reduction over approximately 10 weeks.    
  
  
All patients will begin mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on day -3.  Patients ≥ 40 kilograms will receive 
MMF at the dose of 3 grams/day divided into 2 or 3 doses (every 12 or 8 hours).  Pediatric patient 
(<40 kilograms) will receive MMF at the dose of 15 mg/kg  three times a day.  
  
Patients will be eligible for MMF dosing and pharmacokinetics studies.   
  
Use IV route between days –3 and +5, then, if tolerated, may change to PO between days +6 and +30.   
  
Stop MMF at day +[ADDRESS_724536] day of 3 consecutive days of absolute neutrophil count [ANC] > 0.5 
x 109 /L.   
  
  
4.4  Retinoic Acid  
 Retinoic acid 100 mg/m2/day starts at the day 60 visit and continues daily until 1 year posttransplant.  
  
4.5  Supportive Care  
  
Growth Factors : As the malignant cell population of JMML is known to be hypersensitive to 
GM-CSF, this cytokine will not be used in this protocol.  Patients with ANC <0.2 x  
8 
10 /L on day 21 may receive G -CSF at 5μg/kg/ day.

8.0  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   
Toxicity and adverse events will be classified according to NCI's Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE).  A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded fr om 
the CTEP home page  
(http://ctep.cancer.g ov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40  ).  
  
 7.7.1  Definitions  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience, regardless of 
causality, that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  
Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal 
results of diagnostic proce dures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is consider ed by [CONTACT_1372]  
  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and 
regardless of causality that:  
 Results in death . (death due to disease specifically addressed below)  Is life-
threatening .    
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] .    
MT1999 -20  
January 3, 2022       Page 17 of 23   Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .    
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .  
 Is an important medical event .      
  
An unexpected adverse experience  is defined as any adverse experience that is 
neither identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information provided 
for IRB review (typi[INVESTIGATOR_551439], investigator’s brochure and prescribing 
information)  nor mentioned in the consent form. Unexpected adverse experience and 
unanticipated adverse experience are synonymous terms .  
  
Problems/events that are unanticipated and serious should be reported only if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_551440] a re possibly, probably or definitely related 
to the research treatment.  
  
 7.7.[ADDRESS_724540]’s case record form.  Each event should  be described in detail 
along with start and stop dates, severity, relationship to investigational product, action 
taken and outcome.   
  
All subjects will be monitored through engraftment or the start of a new treatment, 
which ever occurs earlier, as it i s expected that most treatment related adverse events 
will occur during this period.    
  
After engraftment, follow -up is planned for 2 years (per section 6.3).  The investigator 
is obligated, upon knowledge of, to report any adverse event that requires ex pedited 
reporting per section 7.6.3.

estimate of the cumulative proportion of children surviving disease free at 1 year after transplant.   
Secondary outcome measures are the incidence of neutrophil eng raftment, GVHD, regimen -related 
toxicity, and relapse.  The study is planned for 25 years with a total enrollment of 20 patients (about 2 
patients per year).  Since it will be impossible to reach any definitive conclusions about efficacy or 
toxicity of the  proposed regimen for this rare disease, analysis will be descriptive.  The study will be 
monitored for excessive combined incidence of grade III -IV toxicity or primary graft failure, using 
standard definitions.  
  
9.2  Statistical Analysis  
  
The principa l analysis is to compute the 1 -year DFS (P1), the standard error (SE), and 95% 
confidence interval using the product limit (Kaplan Meier survival) estimate at 12 months.   
Experience shows that about 35% of transplanted patients have long -term DFS, but amo ng those that 
relapse the median DFS is a very short 2.[ADDRESS_724542] transplant.  
  
The incidence of GVHD, time to engraftment, and relapse will be similarly evaluated.  Because death 
is a competing risk for these outcomes, the cumulative incidence may also be used.  The time course 
of all events may be described using event charts.  The analyses can only be descriptive because of 
the sample size constraints of this rare disease.  For example, if the true incidence rate (for a primary 
or secondary outcome) is about .75, then the observed rate is 90% likely to be in the interval (0.53 
0.98) .  It will therefore not be possible to make definitive comparisons with historical rates observed 
here and elsewhere for other preparatory regimens.

years.  
  
9.4  Toxicity and Graft Failure Monitoring   
  
The combined incidence of grade III or IV toxicity and primary graft failure associated with the 
preparative regimen (Section 7) will be monitored using a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_215348] R = {2 events in 12 
patients, 3/15 or 4 anytime}.  This stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106560] a type I error rate of 0.05 if the true rate is 5%, 
and a power of 80% if the rate is 25%.29,[ADDRESS_724544] data will be collected, as specified for JMML (CML) patients who receive stem cell 
transplantation.  All patients will be followed until death or loss -to-follow up.  
  
  
  
  
10.0  INFORMED CONSENT  
Both the patient and donor are completely evaluated and presented at a conference with family 
members where the transplant physician outlines the course of therapy.  These recommendations are 
then discussed thoroughly with the patient and family, including  the donor (if of appropriate age).  
The risks of the procedure to the donor are outlined.  The marrow graft procedure and rationale as 
well as alternative forms of therapy are presented as objectively as possible.  All the risks and hazards 
of the procedu re are explained to the patient, or in the case of minors, to the patient's responsible 
family members.  Informed consent is obtained using forms approved at the University of Minnesota 
Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in Research.  
  
  
  
11.0 DATA A ND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN

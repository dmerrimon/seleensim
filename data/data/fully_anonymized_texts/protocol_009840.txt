 6. INTRODUCTION  
Red eye is a common ophthalmologic condition and can include almost any part of the eye.1 
Conjunctival hyperaemia is caused by [CONTACT_212991] t o 
irritation .  This vasodilation causes the red ap pearance of the normally white appearing sclera, leading to 
the conditio n commonly known as “red eye” . 3   Red eye is treatable with over -the-counte r (OTC) 
medications . 2  
 
Preservatives like benzalkonium chloride ( BAK ) have come under the scrutiny of research studies over 
the years for their po tential to disrupt the protective tear film and ocular surface cells. The medical 
community has deemed that despi[INVESTIGATOR_212976], BAK is more cytotoxic in high 
quantities than many other preservatives. In order to provide an alterna tive to BAK, this study will be 
conducted to test the efficacy of two new investigational product s containing,

9.2. Investigational Product  Packaging and Labeling  
All three products  will be identical in color. Test products  will be provided in randomization number  
specific kits . utilizing a one -part label containing the following information:  
 Protocol Number  
 Randomization Number  
 Right Eye or Left Eye  
 Site Identifi cation  
 24-Hour Emergency Phone Number  
 Directions for Use  
 For Investigational Use  
 Warnings  
 Net Contents  
 Expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  
 Storage Conditions  
Labeling of study supplies will be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  All 
investigational, including any commercially available , must be stored in accordance with the 
manufacturers ’ instructio ns. Investigational product supplies must be stored separately . Until dispensed 
to the subjects, the investigational product will be stored in a securely locked area, only accessible to 
authorized personnel.  
9.3. Blinding  and Unblinding  
 
The S ponsor will provi de blinded investigational product. The Investigator/Clinician and the subjects 
will not have access  to the treatment code.  
 
The Investigator/Clinician  will not know which treatment has been administered to subjects. Personnel 
dispensing the test products , collecting  used products  or supervising their use will not participate in the 
examination of subjects in order to minimize potential bias. During supervised use, other staff members 
including the Investigator /Clinician  will not have access to the area wh ere the product is being 
administered.   
 
The randomization scheme will be used by [CONTACT_212993]. The site clinical study 
coordinator will receive one p ackage containing individual subject specific disclosure envelopes 
indicating treatment decode for each randomization number. Identification of the products assigned to a 
subject may be revealed in the event of a serious adverse event by [CONTACT_212994]’s randomization number. In such an instance, the Investigator will, if 
circumstances and time permit, contact [CONTACT_212995]. The date and reason for 

 
COMPANY 
CONFIDENTIAL  
[ADDRESS_255479]  
Version: Final 28MAR2017  
 such unblinding must be descr ibed on the subject’s source document . Upon completion of the study, all 
subject specific disclosure envelopes must be returned to the study monitor  who will return them to the 
sponsor .  
 
Blinding should only be broken when required and only for the subjec t in question. The Investigator 
must notify the Sponsor, when circumstances and time permit, prior to unblinding of any subject. 
Expectedness of serious and related a dverse events should be assessed using the Safety Attestation letter  
and/or, for marketed products, the locally approved labeling.  
 
If there is a medical emergency and the Investigator deems it necessary to know the subject’s study 
treatment urgently for the subject’s proper medical care, the Investigator may break the treatment code 
immediate ly, and then contact [CONTACT_212996]. If in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_212977], the 
Investigator will first contact [CONTACT_212997].  
9.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
 
As the subjects sign a consent form, (s)he will be sequentially issued a subject ID. The subject ID will 
begin with the center ID “ 1001 ” followed by a four - digit unique subject identifier, e.g. “ 10011001 ”. 
Upon qualifying, a unique randomization number will be assigned. This number determines the 
treatment sequence assignment for each subject according to a randomization schedule.  Each subject 
will be randomized to receive [ADDRESS_255480] labels will clearly state “LEFT EYE” or “RIGHT 
EYE”.  The randomization will be assi gned sequentially , from [ADDRESS_255481] 
be signed by [CONTACT_212998]/retrieved the study product, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_212978] b e provided to 
the Sponsor at the end of the study for the Trial  Master File.  
At the end of the study, the Study Monitor will conduct the final investigational product accountability. 
All investigational products and study disclosure envelopes must be retur ned to the Sponsor. The 
Sponsor will provide instructions as to return  of any used and unused investigational product.

 9.6. Administration of the Investigational Product  
Subjects will be provided written and oral instructions for their products  by [CONTACT_779] .  
9.7. Product Quality Complaints  
 
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability or safety of a product, including its 
labeling, delivery sy stem or packaging integrity.  This does not include effectiveness, preference or 
performance measures, which will be reviewed in aggregate at appropriate intervals.  
 
Any issues with the product discovered during the initial inventory of study supplies shou ld follow the 
instructions provided on the receipt letter; no PQC form should be filed for issues identified when 
opening or unpacking a shipment. Subsequently, any observation of a PQC requires immediate 
notification to the study manager via a completed P QC form and telephone call.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_212979], sign and forward a copy of the PQC form, via an agreed upon 
secure exchange, to the study manager listed below.  
 
 
 
 
  
In addition, PQC information must be included on the Investigational Product Dispensing and 
Accountability Log or equivalent in the comments field.  The Study Manager listed can assist you or 
answer questions related to this process.  To aid in the initial conversation and understanding of a PQC, 
the site staff may be asked to photograph the issue and send it to the Study Manager.  
When enrolling subjects into this study it is the site’s respons ibility to instruct subjects not to use the 
product if they have a concern related to the product such as an issue with the labeling, investigational 
product or package integrity and to immediately report it using the instruction on the Informed Consent 
or product label.

 12. ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING   
12.1. Introduction  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group , or suspected causal  relationship to the 
investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following  sections.   For all AEs, the 
Investigator or medically qualified individual (MD/DO/ DMD/DDS ) must pursue and obtain information 
adequate both to  determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for  
classification as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  requiri ng immediate notification (within 24 hours) to  
the Sponsor or its designated representative.   For all AEs, sufficient information  should  be obtained by 
[CONTACT_213004] (MD/DO/  DMD/DDS)  to try to determine causality .  
The Investigator  is required to assess causality.  For AEs with a suspected causal  relationship to the 
investigational product, follow -up by [CONTACT_213004] (MD/DO/  
DMD/DDS)  is required until the  event or its sequelae resolve  or stabilize at a level acceptable to the 
Investigator, and the  Sponsor concurs with that assessment.  
12.2. Reporting Period  
All AEs, whether serious or non -serious, observed and/or spontaneously reported, beginning from the 
time the informed consent is signed and dated, are collected on the source document. AEs of randomized 
subjects will be reported in EDC while screen failure subjects will not.  Informed consent  is considered 
the point at which the subject  is participatin g in the clinical study and all events are captured even if it is  
prior to undergoing any study -related  procedure and/or receiving investigational product  Non-serious 
adverse events will be  reported through the subject’s last study visit (or termination if the subject 
terminates early  from the study for any reason).   Non-serious adverse events are to be reported in the 
source documents and the adverse event  page of the EDC. Details of any signs and symptoms will be 
described and recorded,  including resolution of the adverse event.   
Spontaneous reports of serious AEs will be collected through and including [ADDRESS_255497]’s last dose or exposure to investigational product.    
Serious AEs require immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated  representa tive.  Any SAE  
occurring any time after the reporting period must  be promptly reported if a causal relationship to study 
product is suspected . 
12.3. Definition of an Adverse Event   
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a subject after they have signed an informed 
consent for a trial involving an investigational product.  Any AE that occurs after the informed consent  
has been signed , until first usage of investigational product, will be considered non -treatment emergent 
and cannot (by [CONTACT_213005]) have a causal relationship with the investigational product.    
The event does not need to have a suspected causal relationship  with th e investigational product or 
device .  Therefore, a n AE can be any unfavorable and  unintended s ign, symptom, disease or injury 
temporally associated with the use of a n investigational  product whether or not related to the 
investigational  product .  Examples of  adverse events include but are not limited to:  
 Abnormal test findings,   
 Clinically importan t symptoms and signs,   

 
COMPANY 
CONFIDENTIAL  
[ADDRESS_255498]  
Version: Final 28MAR2017  
  Changes in physical examination findings,  
 Hypersensitivity, and   
 Progression/worsening of underlying disease.   
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:  
 Overdose,   
 Withdrawal,   
 Abuse,   
 Drug misuse,   
 Drug interactions,  
 Medication errors,   
 Product dependency,  
 Exposure in utero , and 
 Study related procedure.  
12.4. Abnormal Test Findings  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as  an adverse 
event are as follows:  
 Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
 Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention,  and/or  
 Test result leads to a discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant  
treatment, or other therapy, and/or   
 Test result is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_29539].  
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
adverse event.  Any abnormal test result th at is determined to be an error does not require  reporting as an 
adverse event.  
12.5. Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  for Drug s  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” for a drug study if, in the view of either the  
Investigator (MD/DO/ DMD/DDS)  or the Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:   
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death),  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
 Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  
conduct normal life functions,   

 
COMPANY 
CONFIDENTIAL  
[ADDRESS_255499]  
Version: Final 28MAR2017  
  Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect,   
 Is considered medically significant (medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is app ropriate in other situations,  such as important 
medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or  require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212981] a serious adverse drug experience when,  based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes  listed above).   Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment in an Emergency Room or at home, 
blood dyscrasia, or  convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug 
dependency or  drug abuse, or malignancy), or,  
 Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medical product (medically  
significant)  and should be reported a s an SAE in the category  ‘Other medically important 
condition s.’ 
12.6. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212982].  Any initial admission (even if less than 2 4 hours) to a  healthcare 
facility meets these criteria.   Admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212983]/intensive 
care unit (e.g., from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to  a coronary care unit, 
neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit).   Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:   
 Rehabilitation facilities,  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593],  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (e.g., caregiver relief),  
 Skilled nursing facilities,  
 Nursing homes,  
 Emergency room visits (unless the reason for the e mergency room visit meets one of the 
other outcomes in the definition of serious), and/or  
 Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures)  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
AE is not in itself a SAE.  Examples include:  
 Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition not associated with the development of a 
new AE or with a worsening of the pre -existing condition (e.g., for work -up of persistent pre -
treatment lab abnormality ),  
 Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep),  
 Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam),  
 Protocol -specified admission during a clinical study (e.g., for a procedure required by [CONTACT_60658]),  

 
COMPANY 
CONFIDENTIAL  
[ADDRESS_255500]  
Version: Final 28MAR2017  
  Optional admission not as sociated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (e.g.,  or elective cosmetic 
surgery),  
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline source documentation for 
the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.   
 Diagnostic and t herapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not  
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was  performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an  acute appendicit is 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as  the AE and the resulting 
appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the  AE. 
12.7. Resolution  
The Investigator will be required to assess the outcome of the AE for investigational product  as one of 
the following:   
 Resolved,   
 Not Resolved,  
 Fatal,  
 Resolved with sequelae,   
 Resolving, or  
 Unknown.  
Any causally -related AEs unresolved upon completion of the last study visit will be  followed up by [CONTACT_213006] a level  acceptable to the Investigator and 
recorded in the EDC system .  An event that is assessed as resolved with sequelae or resolving indicates 
that the subject has  stabilized to a level acceptable to the Investigator and has con currence by [CONTACT_429].  
12.8. Severity Assessment  
The severity of AEs from investigational product will be assessed by [CONTACT_213007] (MD/DO/ DMD/DDS) using the following  general categorical descriptors:   
MILD : Awareness of s ymptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal  discomfort and not 
interfering with subject's usual function or normal  everyday activities  
MODERATE : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference to some extent with  subject's 
usual function or n ormal everyday activity    
SEVERE :  Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or  incapacitation; 
interferes significantly with subject's usual function; prevents  normal everyday 
activities  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe  event is not 
necessarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes  significantly with 
subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serio us unless it met  one of the criteria for SAE s, 
listed above.

 12.9. Causality Assessment  
 The Investigator’s or medically qualified individual  (MD/DO/ DMD/DDS) assessment of 
causality for investigational product (i.e., relationship to investigational product) must  be 
provided for all AEs (serious and nonserious).   An Investigator’s causality  assessment is the 
determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the  investigational product 
caused or contributed to an AE.  
 Not Related - An AE that is n ot related to the use of the drug   
 Doubtful - An AE for which an alternative explanation is more likely, e.g.,  concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a  causal 
relationship to investigational product is unlikely.   
 Possible - An AE that might be due to the use of the drug.   An alternative  explanation, e.g., 
concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive.  The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship to investigat ional product cannot be excluded.   
 Probable - An AE that might be due to the use of the drug.   The relationship  in time is 
suggestive (e.g., confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]) and an alternative explanation is  less likely, 
e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant dis ease(s).   
 Very Likely - An AE that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot  be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g., concomitant drug(s),  concomitant disease(s).   
The relationship in time is very suggestive (e.g.,  it is confi rmed by [CONTACT_213008]) for a causal relationship to th e drug . 
If the Investigator determines a SAE  is associated with study procedures, the  Investigator must record 
this suspected causal relationship in the source documents and in the EDC system , as appropriate, and 
report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE  reporting requirements, if applicable.  
12.9.1.  Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events  
When a subject withdraws due to a SAE , the SAEs  must be  reported in accordance with the reporting 
requi rements defined below.  
12.9.2.  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_213009].  In addition, each study subject will be questioned  about AEs.  
12.9.3.  Reporting Requiremen ts 
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for a SAE .  If a SAE occurs, expedited 
reporting will follow local and international  regulations, as appropriate.   
For randomized subjects, a ll AEs will be reported on the AE source document page and then will be 
entered in EDC. A Clinical  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form must also be completed if the 
event is considered  to be serious.  It should be noted that this Clinical SAE Report Form for collection of 
SAE informati on is not the same as the AE EDC page .  Where the same data are  collected, the forms 
must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE term should be used on both 

 
COMPANY 
CONFIDENTIAL  
[ADDRESS_255502]  
Version: Final 28MAR2017  
 forms.  Adverse events should be reported using concise  medical terminology  in the EDC system  as well 
as on the form for collection of SAE information.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
If a SAE  occurs, the Sponsor is to be initially notified by [CONTACT_213010]’s si te.  Within 24 hours of the  Investigator site’s awareness of the event, the 
study site must send the Sponsor the Clinical  SAE Report Form  (via a secure e -mail) .  This timeframe 
also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on  previously forwarded SAE  reports as well as 
to the initial and follow -up reporting of EIU cases.   In the rare event that the Investigator’s site does not 
become aware of the occurrence of a  SAE  immediately (e.g., if an outpatient study subject initially seeks 
treatment  elsewhe re), the Investigator’s site is to report the event immediately after learning of it as  
described and document the time of the study site’s first awareness of the AE.   
For all SAE s, the Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information  to the Sp onsor in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.   In addition,  an Investigator may be 
requested by [CONTACT_213011] -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information may be more detailed than th at captured  on the AE case report form.   In general, this 
will include a description of the adverse  event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical 
assessment of the case and  independent determination of possible causality.   Information on other  
possible causes of the  event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided. In the 
case of a  subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings (if available) and death certificate  
should be collected if permission is obtained from t he subject’s family.  For a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a  copy of 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212984]. If obtained, these documents  (with subject’s 
personal identifiers redacted) should be submitted as soon as possible to the  Sponsor or its designated 
representative.   
Appropriate SAE forms will be provided to the study site at the initiation of the study .  Upon  
notification of an SAE at the study site, the Investigator or designated study site staff should  call and 
speak to their Sponsor’s study team co ntact immediately to initially notify them of the  SAE.    
Within 24 hours of awareness of the event, the Investigator or designated study site staff : 
 Complete the Clinical SAE Report Form [ that has been provided to you by [CONTACT_213012] ] with  as much  information as possible, however at a minimum, the subject 
identification number,  name [CONTACT_185317], SAE, and name [CONTACT_213022]);    
 Ensures the Investigator signs the Clinical SAE Report Form prior to sending to the  
Sponsor;   
 Scans and send via secure email the Clinical SAE Report Form and any supportive 
documentation to the Sponsor contacts.    
 The Sponsor contact [CONTACT_3031]:

12.10.  Special Situations  
Special Situations (SS): Safety events that may not meet the  definition of  an AE; however, are required 
to be collected to meet Health  Authority requirements. Examples include:  
 Overdose of a J&J medicinal product.  
 Pregnancy exposure (maternal and paternal) to a J&J medicinal  product or medical 
device.  
 Exposure to a  J&J product from breastfeeding.  
 Suspected abuse/misuse of a J&J medicinal product or medical device.  
 Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a J&J medicinal product or  medical device 
(including occupational exposure).  
 Any failure of expected pharmacological  or medical device action (i.e. , lack of effect) of 
a J&J product.  
 Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a J&J product.  
 Medication error involving a J&J medicinal product or medical device  with or without 
patient/consumer exposure to the J&J product, (e.g. , product name [CONTACT_2976]) OR that caused 
an unintended effect or could  cause an intended effect (e.g. adult medicine given to a young 
child).  
 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a J&J product.  
 Off-label use.   Note: Off -label  use of a product without an associated AE should be collected 
only when it is specifically and voluntarily brought to the attention of the company in an 
unsolicited manner by a reporter ( e.g., Patient or HCP), or data obtained from databases 
where off -label use may be systematically collected (e.g., reimbursement database in US), 
and in accordance with local procedure in compliance with local laws and regulations.

 12.11.  Exposure In Utero  
For investigational products within clinical studies and for marketed products, an exposure in utero  EIU 
occurs if:   
1. A woman is exposed to the investigational product at any time between her last menses prior to 
conception through the delivery of the baby.   
2. There is a possibility of intrauterine exposure to drug via semen from the male partner who is 
taking the investigational product at the time of conception, thereby [CONTACT_213013].  
If any study subject or study subject’s part ner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the  study 
subject’s participation, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor on a  Pregnancy 
Notification Form (to be provided by [CONTACT_213014]) .  In addition, the Investigator must  
submit information regarding  environmental exposure to a Sponsor product in a pregnant woman (e.g., a 
nurse reports that  she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) 
using  the Pregnancy  Notification Form.  This mu st be done irrespective of whether an adverse  event has 
occurred and notification must occur within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.   Initial notification 
via telephone to the Sponsor’s study team contact [CONTACT_213015]’s 
awareness of the pregnancy.   The Pregnancy Notification Form must then be sent to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of the si te’s awareness.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of 
delivery (see below for  information related to induced termination of pregnancy).   
Follow -up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all EIU reports.  The Investigator 
will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination  (i.e., induced abortion) and 
then notify the Sponsor of the outcome.  The Investigator will  provide this information as a follow -up to 
the initial Drug Exposure During Pregnancy  Collection Form A and/or End of Pregnancy Collection 
Form B (provided by [CONTACT_213016]).   The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be 
specified.  An EIU report is  not created when an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this 
pregnancy is not usually  viable.  Rather, a SAE  case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy.    
The Inv estigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAE s if the  outcome of the pregnancy meets 
the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly [including  that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth, or neonatal death]).  In the case of a 
live birth, the  “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth (i.e., no minimum follow -
up period of a presumably normal infant is required before an End of Pregnancy Collection For m B can 
be completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by [CONTACT_213017], unless 
pre-abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly.    
Additional pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAE s and should be  reported as such include:   
 “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion.  
 All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_255505] to causality.  
 Any infant death after [ADDRESS_255506]

 14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOU RCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
The in vestigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review and 
regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_20618]/documents.  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject  into the study,  a representative of [COMPANY_012] 
will visit the investigational study site to:  
 Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
 Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities the site's 
responsibility with regard to protocol adhe rence  as well as the study and monitoring 
responsibilities of [COMPANY_012]  or its representatives.  Th ese responsibilities will be 
documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between [COMPANY_012] and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor fro m [COMPANY_012]  or representative will have regular contacts with 
the investigational site, for the following:  
 Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
 Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
 Confirm that the investigational team is adh ering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the  source documents and  case report forms, and that investigational 
product accountability checks are being performed  
 Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the da ta in the case report 
forms with the subject ’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for each subject  
(e.g., clinic charts).  
 Record and report all protocol deviations not previously sent to [COMPANY_012] . 
 Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented in the EDC system  and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to [COMPANY_012]  and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs information or 
study -related direction . 
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of [COMPANY_012] , a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, 
including source data verification.  The purpose of a  [COMPANY_012] audit or inspection is to 
systematically  and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine 
whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported 
according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the Intern ational Conference on 
Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The investigator should contact [CONTACT_213018] a regulatory agency about an  inspection.

 16. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
16.1. Case Report Forms / Electronic Data Capture  
As used in this protocol, the ter m case report form (CRF) should be understood to refer to  the Electronic 
Data Capture system.  
All data will be collected on source documents first and then recorded in the Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC ) system .   
The EDC system , is the database where pertinent study data is collected such as demography, subject 
randomization, ocular assessments , adverse events, and subject disposition.  
Electronic Data Capture pages should be completed for each randomized  subject.  The completed pages 
of the EDC system are the sole property of the Sponsor and should not be  made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of the  Sponsor or appropriate regulatory authorities, 
without written permission from the Spon sor. 
It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all  information 
captured in the EDC. The subject’s data in the EDC system must be  electronically signed by [CONTACT_3786]. These signatures serve to attest that t he information  contained in the EDC system is true. 
At all times, the Investigator has final personal  responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all 
clinical data entered in  the EDC. Subject source documents are the Investigator's subject records  
maintained at the study site. In cases where the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212985]'s 
chart, the information collected in the EDC must match those charts.  
All final data recorded in EDC system will be kept by [CONTACT_213020].   
All data recorded on source documents will be kept at the clinical site.  
16.2. Inspection of Records  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the investigator agrees to 
keep records including the identity of all pa rticipating subjects (sufficient information to link records, 
e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], SAE  
forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition.  The records should be retained 
by [CONTACT_178473], local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study 
Agreement, whichever is longer . 
16.3. Retention of Records  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_46296] a period of [ADDRESS_255510] article for investigation.  If it becomes necessary for Johnson  & Johnson or the Regulatory 
Authority to review any docum entation relating to the study, the Investigator must permit access to such 
records.  
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the Sponsor should be 
prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to  an acceptable designee, such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor.  The investigator must obtain Sponsor's written 
permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met .

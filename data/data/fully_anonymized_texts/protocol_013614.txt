[ADDRESS_184348] Context: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or chronic lung disease of prematurity, is most commonly defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). BPD affects nearly half of surviving extremely preterm (<28 weeks gestational age) infants, and the incidence of BPD has increased over time. Infants with BPD face more than doubled odds of death after 36 weeks PMA or disability at 5 years compared to preterms without BPD. BPD is associated with abnormal lung function throughout childhood and significantly increases health care costs. Cognitive and respi[INVESTIGATOR_158727]; thus, optimal long-term management of BPD during infancy may ultimately improve cognitive outcomes of this high-risk population.   Objectives: The primary objective is to compare the incidence of intermittent hypoxemia (IH) and total duration of hypoxia up to 6 months corrected age (CA) among infants with BPD randomized to higher versus lower oxygen saturation (SpO2) target ranges. The secondary objective is to describe clinically relevant outcomes over the first 6 months in the two study groups. Study Design: This is a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_29833]. Since the two SpO2 target groups in the current trial represent the currently accepted range of clinical practice, neither group is labeled as “intervention” or “control.” Setting/Participants: In collaboration with Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971] (HUP) and its affiliate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], potential participants will be enrolled from the Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) at The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP), Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (PAH) and HUP. We will enroll up to 50 infants who were born <30 weeks and who remain on respi[INVESTIGATOR_158728] 34-44 weeks PMA (ie, have moderate or severe BPD). CA.  Study Interventions and Measures: Enrolled infants will be randomized to higher or lower SpO2 target ranges (a target SpO2 of >=96% or 90-94%). The study intervention will begin in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158729] 6 months. We will utilize 2- second sampling and averaging times and measure IH longitudinally throughout the study period in all participants regardless of home oxygen use. We define IH as SpO2<80% for >30 seconds. Primary outcomes are incidence of IH and total duration of hypoxemia up to 6 months CA. Specifically, these are measured as differences between the two groups in incidence of IH at 40 weeks PMA, 3 months CA, and 6 months CA and percent of recording time spent <80%, <85% and <90% SpO2 over the study period. Secondary outcomes are growth, feeding development, health-related resource utilization and quality of life. The study team will use novel technology to perform overnight continuous oximetry after discharge and until [ADDRESS_184349] device, whenever relevant, supplemental oxygen will be titrated according to a study algorithm, in order to maintain study participants within the target SpO2 ranges.  
       
   ix PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Study Title The Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Saturation TARgeting Pi[INVESTIGATOR_158730] I (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]) Study Rationale Supplemental oxygen is a lifesaving therapy for premature infants and a common post-discharge treatment for BPD. There is limited evidence to guide the use of supplemental oxygen beyond the immediate newborn period. No controlled studies have described continuous oxygen saturation monitoring post-discharge for infants with established BPD or evaluated the safety and efficacy of reducing IH to improve outcomes of infants with established BPD. Study Objective(s) Primary  • To compare the incidence of IH (SpO2 <80% for >=30 seconds) up to 6 months corrected age among infants with moderate or severe BPD randomized to higher versus lower SpO2 target ranges. Secondary • To explore clinically relevant outcomes over the first [ADDRESS_184350] Article(s)  Preterm born infants who remain on respi[INVESTIGATOR_158728] 34-44 weeks PMA will be randomized to higher or lower oxygen saturation target ranges, which will be maintained until 6 months corrected age.  Both of these target ranges are within the wider range commonly used in clinical practice. • For the lower target group our goal is to keep oxygen saturations between 90-94%. In hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], inspi[INVESTIGATOR_158731]2. Monitoring will continue after discharge, and whenever children are discharged on supplemental oxygen, oxygen flow will be titrated monthly according to a standardized algorithm. • For the higher target group our goal is to keep oxygen saturations greater than or equal to 96%. In hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], inspi[INVESTIGATOR_158731]2. Monitoring will continue after discharge, and whenever children are discharged on supplemental oxygen, oxygen flow will be titrated monthly according to a standardized algorithm.

   [ADDRESS_184354] study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of home oxygen saturation targeting for this vulnerable population. 1.1 Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is most commonly defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. BPD affects nearly half of surviving extremely preterm (<28 weeks gestational age) infants, and the incidence of BPD has increased over time. Infants with BPD face more than doubled odds of death after 36 weeks PMA or disability at 5 years compared to preterms without BPD. BPD is associated with abnormal lung function throughout childhood and significantly increases health care costs. Cognitive and respi[INVESTIGATOR_158727]; thus, optimal long-term management of BPD during infancy may ultimately improve cognitive outcomes of this high-risk population.   Supplemental oxygen is a lifesaving therapy for premature infants; yet, there is limited evidence to guide the use of supplemental oxygen beyond the immediate newborn period. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) has been quite definitive in stating that “oxygen is increasingly viewed as a safe and relatively convenient means for maximizing growth and development” in infants with BPD. But supplemental oxygen also carries potential risk, as it is implicated in the causal pathway for morbidities such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). In addition, targeting high oxygen saturations (SpO2) with supplemental oxygen may be associated with increased pulmonary oxygen toxicity and decreased quality of life, without improving neurologic outcomes. In the absence of sound evidence to guide medical decisions, there is currently a significant variation in practice with regard to use of oxygen therapy in this population. No controlled studies have evaluated the safety or efficacy of supplemental oxygen for improving outcomes of infants with established BPD. This is a critical knowledge gap in neonatal and pediatric pulmonary medicine. This study will test whether targeting higher versus lower oxygen saturations in infants with BPD influences rates of hypoxemia and clinical outcomes during the first [ADDRESS_184355] compared oxygen saturation (SpO2) target ranges for extremely preterm infants immediately after birth, up to only [ADDRESS_184356] differing methodology and conflicting results.(1-3) Two older trials compared SpO2 target ranges for slightly older preterm infants. The BOOST trial randomized 358 preterm infants who were oxygen dependent at 32 weeks to higher (95- 98%) or standard (91-94%) saturation target ranges. (4) Participants remained on the study intervention until oxygen was discontinued: a median of 2.[ADDRESS_184357] Trial did not demonstrate any 
    
   3 benefits associated with targeting higher SpO2 in this population. The STOP- ROP multicenter trial randomized 649 infants with pre-threshold retinopathy and a median SpO2 of <94% to conventional oxygen targets (SpO2 89-- 94%) and supplemental oxygen targets (96-99%). (5) These targets were continued for two weeks or until the infants met the ophthalmologic endpoint of the study, whichever occurred later. STOP-ROP was stopped early for futility and a loss of equipoise in favor of the high saturation arm. The adjusted odds ratio for progression to threshold retinopathy in the supplemental arm as compared to the conventional arm, which was the primary outcome of the trial, was 0.72 (95%CI 0.52-1.01). In these trials, there were no differences between the groups in growth at 36 weeks or 12 months (BOOST) or 2 months (STOP- ROP).(4,5) In summary, RCTs in the acute newborn period up to [ADDRESS_184358] conflicting results; and studies from 32-[ADDRESS_184359] of prolonged SpO2 targeting for very preterm children with moderate or severe BPD after 36 weeks. Secondary analyses of a large randomized trial comparing higher versus lower SpO2 targeting for newborn extremely preterm infants(6) demonstrated that IH, and in particular events <80% for at least one minute, are common in this population between birth and at least 9-10 weeks of age.(7) The duration of time with SpO2 <80% is associated with the combined outcome of death after [ADDRESS_184360] 33 PMA and in room air.(8) The control group had an average of 8.4 epi[INVESTIGATOR_21262] (decline in SpO2 by [CONTACT_2669] 5% from baseline to <90% and lasting at least 5 seconds) per hour at 35 weeks PMA, which declined to 3.0 events per hour at 39 weeks PMA. The total time spent with saturations <90%, <85%, and <80% declined dramatically between [ADDRESS_184361] IH after discharge; whether targeting higher SpO2 ameliorates IH; and whether this management strategy is associated with improved outcomes until 6 months of age.  1.4 Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158737] 45 CFR 46 and the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline approved by [CONTACT_941] 
    
   4 International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH). All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478]. The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent and assent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance with The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137069]. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study.   [ADDRESS_184362] whether targeting higher, as compared to lower, oxygen saturations reduces the incidence of IH and improves clinical outcomes for preterm infants with established BPD. 2.1 Primary Objective The primary objectives of this study are to compare the incidence of intermittent hypoxemia (defined as: SpO2 <80% for >=30 seconds) and total duration of hypoxemia between [ADDRESS_184363] 6 months in the two study groups. These outcomes include quality of life, respi[INVESTIGATOR_38324]-related resource utilization, feeding, and growth.  3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 3.1 General Schema of Study Design The proposed study will be a randomized clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. Enrolled infants with moderate or severe BPD will be randomized to higher or lower oxygen saturation (SpO2) target ranges, which will be maintained until 6 months corrected age.   The two SpO2 target groups represent the currently accepted range of clinical practice. Therefore, neither group is labeled as “intervention” or “control.” Please reference Table 1 above for an overall visual explanation of study procedures. The study procedures will be discussed in detail in section 4. 3.1.1 Screening- Baseline Potential subjects will be screened using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Parental/guardian permission (informed consent), will be obtained prior to any study related procedures being performed. Randomization occurs when infants have been extubated.  However, parents of infants who are on higher levels of support, may be approached to introduce the study. Consent will be obtained at time of extubation. Once the infant meets all eligibility criteria (, the 
    
   [ADDRESS_184364] will be randomized to higher or lower oxygen saturation (SpO2) target ranges and study monitoring (3.1.2) will begin.   3.1.2 Phase 1 – Inpatient monitoring After randomization, the alarm settings on the standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158738]’s group assignment. The study SpO2 ranges are similar to the standard of care ranges in the CHOP NICU, where the clinical alarms for infants born <30 weeks are 95% (high) and 87% (low) until 36 weeks PMA. After 36 weeks PMA, alarms are set at 98% (high) and 90% (low). Participants will continue on the study-- mandated alarm settings until discharge to home.  In addition, participants will be placed on the study monitor in order to facilitate collection of study data.  This is similar to the approach previously used in the CHOP and HUP NICUs for the Canadian Oxygen Trial.  Nurses will be instructed to follow alarms from the clinical monitors, not the study monitor, while the infant is in the NICU.  Per standard of care, the infant will be on the clinical monitor continuously.  Every effort will be made to also keep the infant on the study monitor continuously; however, it is sufficient to have minimum of 4 days per week/8 hours per day of data.  This is consistent with the minimum planned data collection planned for the outpatient phase of the study. If patients are reintubated, oxygen saturation targets will be at the discretion of the clinical team.  However, they will be encouraged to maintain the study mandated targets. 3.1.3 Phase 2 – Outpatient monitoring  At the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], as detailed below, families will be given a Masimo oximeter along with a device that will transmit the oximetry data back to the study team at CHOP.  They will be instructed how to use the device nightly while the child is sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_158739]. Infants who are discharged per clinical recommendations on supplemental oxygen will have frequent visits in the CHOP Pulmonary Clinic. Oxygen titration and weaning will be standardized according to the algorithm in Table 2, below.   
 Table 2: Home Nasal Cannula Flow Titration Algorithm*  HIGHER SpO2 TARGET ARM (>96%) LOWER SpO2 TARGET ARM (>90%) Criteria for INCREASING O2 flow rate SpO2 < 96% for > 10% of recorded time SpO2 < 90% for > 10% of recorded time Criteria for MAINTAINING current O2 flow rate SpO2 >= 96% for 90---95% of recorded time SpO2 > 90% for >= 90% of recorded time but NOT > 94% for >= 90% of recorded time Criteria for WEANING O2 flow rate SpO2 >= 96% for >95% of recorded time SpO2 > 94% for >= 90% of recorded time *Decisions will be made by [CONTACT_158756]. A minimum of 4 days of data, with a minimum of 8 hours per day, will be required for analysis to make a wean. Oxygen flow rates will be decreased stepwise: 2 LPM – 1.5 LPM – 1 LPM – 1/2 LPM – 1/4 LPM – 1/8 LPM. Once the child is stable on 1/8 LPM, he/she will be weaned off for increasing duration of time: first 6 hours, then 12 hours per day, and finally off completely. 
    
   6 Downloaded oximetry data will be reviewed and decisions about weaning will be made each week by [CONTACT_3476] (including [CONTACT_158772] from the Division of Pediatric Pulmonology). In the home setting, weans may be performed as often as every week. If an infant loses >5% of body weight in any month, no oxygen weans will be made until the weight is regained. If an infant is discharged without oxygen or weans off but then meets the criteria for increasing flow on two subsequent recordings, the family will be instructed to attend pulmonary clinic for assessment and then home oxygen therapy will be instituted. 3.1.4 Phase 3 – [ADDRESS_184365] of care, participants will be evaluated in the CHOP Neonatal Follow-up Program at 3 and 6 months corrected ages. Several study outcomes, clinical outcomes in particular, will be assessed during these clinical visits. Based on the limited existing literature, average age of weaning from supplemental oxygen in infants with BPD is between 2-4.5 months corrected age.(9,10)  For the current study, the oxygen titration protocol and study oximetry will continue until [ADDRESS_184366] primarily responsible for the child’s ongoing BPD care will make decisions about further weaning. For all other participants, ongoing clinical care will be provided by [CONTACT_158757]- up clinic and pediatrician. 3.2 Allocation to Treatment Groups and Blinding Infants will be randomized to higher or lower oxygen saturation (SpO2) target ranges. The randomization sequence will be determined in advance, stratified by [CONTACT_58032] (<27 and 27-29 6/7 weeks at birth) and severity of BPD (moderate or severe, see Table 3 below) and balanced in random blocks of [ADDRESS_184367] the scientific rigor of the study. After randomization, study group assignments will not be blinded. Multiples will be randomized separately. The two target SpO2 ranges in the current trial represent the middle and upper range of the currently accepted range of clinical practice in our center.

Many of the children eligible for the study will be followed by [CONTACT_158758], which has both inpatient and outpatient components. In addition, all children will be eligible for routine care in the CHOP Neonatal Follow-up Program (NFP). It is anticipated that most outcomes assessments will be performed during routine pulmonary or NFP follow-up appointments.

Individual study procedures are described in detail below. 4.1 Inpatient screening and enrollment Data elements to be collected are listed in section 5.  4.2 Inpatient study procedures and data collection Details of randomization are provided above in section 3.2.  4.2.1 Oxygen Saturation Monitoring • While inpatient patients will have two monitors, a clinical monitor and a research monitor • Alarm limits on the clinical monitor will be changed to reflect randomization assignment. • Study oximeter will be placed on baby [CONTACT_158760]. • Orders in EPIC will be changed to reflect randomization  Data elements to be collected after enrollment and during the inpatient phase are listed in section 5. An interpreter will be used to administer questionnaires to non-English speaking subjects.  4.3 Outpatient study procedures and data collection 4.3.1 Oxygen Saturation Monitoring • Prior to discharge, the family will receive a Masimo oximeter which will transmit data to the study team at CHOP.   • The study team will instruct the family how to use the oximeter correctly. • The family will “teach back,” demonstrating that they understand correct use of the monitor. • After discharge, the family will attach the probe to the toe and turn on the monitor each night while the child is in the crib.  It will be disconnected and turned off in the morning, unless the child has been ordered for continuous home pulse oximetry by [CONTACT_158761] 
    
   9 physician.  If clinical orders are for increased monitoring, the clinical orders will be followed.   • Oximetry data will be transmitted to the study team at CHOP nightly between discharge and 6 months CA.  • Each week the study team will review a report of the transmitted oximetry data. • If the child is discharged on supplemental oxygen (based on clinical judgment), this will be weaned based on the child’s assigned target saturation range and the study algorithm. This algorithm standardizes the typi[INVESTIGATOR_158741]. Downloaded data will be reviewed weekly and decisions about weaning will be made by [CONTACT_3476].  In the home setting, weans may be performed as often as every week.  If an infant loses >5% of body weight in any month, no oxygen weans will be made until the weight is regained.  If an infant is discharged without oxygen or weans off but then meets the criteria for increasing flow on two subsequent recordings, the family will be instructed to attend pulmonary clinic for assessment and then home oxygen therapy will be instituted. • Families will be instructed how to evaluate the infant in the case of an alarm, just as with home clinical monitoring.  If the infant is kicking/moving and the alarm seems related to motion, they will ensure that the probe is well secured and follow for further events.  If the alarms are recurrent and the infant has respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], response will differ based on the infant's situation:  If the child is on oxygen, the family will be instructed to turn up the oxygen and call the pulmonary team. If the child is not on oxygen and has mild distress or cold symptoms, they will be instructed to call the pediatrician.  All children with severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_158742].  This is all consistent with the instructions given to all families of children with BPD at the time of discharge from the neonatal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 4.3.[ADDRESS_184371] a clinical visit with either the Neonatal Follow-up Program, the Chronic Lung Disease Program, or the Pulmonary clinic at about 3 months corrected age.  If none of these are scheduled, at visit at the CTRC will be arranged.  If this is not possible, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_158743] a home visit with the family.  The 3 month assessments can be conducted in any of these locations. Specific data elements to be collected during these clinical or study visits are listed in section 5. 4.3.3 End of Study Protocol mandated monitoring of oxygen saturations will continue until the child reaches 6 months corrected age.  At that time, if the child remains in supplemental oxygen, decisions about subsequent monitoring will be made by [CONTACT_2252]’s pulmonologist.  If the infant is at home in room air without intermittent hypoxemia (definition below) for [ADDRESS_184372] (earliest possible discontinuation of study monitoring at 48 weeks PMA) before [ADDRESS_184373] interim clinical visits to the Neonatal Follow-up Program, Pulmonary clinic, and the pediatrician.  Wherever possible, study visits will be arranged to align with these visits.  4.5 Concomitant Medication The majority of infants at our center are discharged without caffeine therapy; clinicians will be encouraged to continue this practice because caffeine is likely to impact incidence of intermittent hypoxemia.(8) The study will not dictate diuretic use either in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158744], but clinicians will be strongly encouraged to wean diuretics before oxygen.(11) Ultimately, however, this will be a clinical decision. Exposure to caffeine, diuretics, bronchodilators, steroids, and any other medications will be recorded throughout the study. The dates of administration, dosage, and reason for use will be included.  4.[ADDRESS_184374] Completion/Withdrawal Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator for lack of adherence or tolerance to testing procedures. Participants will not be withdrawn from the study for missing follow up appointments. If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events after the subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source documents and on the CRF. 4.6.[ADDRESS_184375] Review: Screening The CHOP/HUP/PAH electronic medical record (EMR) will be accessed to identify potential candidates who are CHOP/HUP/PAH patients. Screening for eligibility based on medical record review will include: • Date of birth (inclusion criterion) • Gender • Gestational age (inclusion criterion) • Race 
    
   11 • Ethnicity • Moderate or severe BPD based on the NIH consensus definition at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (inclusion criterion)(12) • Presence of any exclusion criteria 5.1.2 Inpatient Data Collection After enrollment and randomization, the following data will be collected from the EMR while the patient is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: • Birthweight • Birth hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] • Date of transfer to CHOP,HUP, of PAH (if applicable) • Antenatal steroid treatment • Reason for preterm birth • Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]  • Growth parameters at 36 weeks PMA • Growth parameters at 40 weeks PMA • Treatment with the following medications for BPD: iNO, postnatal steroids, inhaled bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, other • Any surgeries • Neonatal morbidities (surgical NEC, PDA ligation, ROP surgery, etc). • Screening for pulmonary hypertension 5.1.3 Discharge Data Collection • Discharge feeding plan • Discharge respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] • Discharge medications • Discharge growth parameters • Discharge date 
    
   12 5.1.4 Outpatient Data Collection During the remainder of the study period, the following data will be collected: • Rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]: location, duration, and ICU care, primary reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] • Medication use • Visits to doctor or emergency room, with reason • Procedures or surgeries • Growth parameters as assessed at any clinical visit(s) • Mode of feeding • Developmental assessment (Bayley screener)  5.1.5 Parental Data Collection • Infant quality of life questionnaires 5.2 Efficacy Evaluations 5.2.1 Efficacy Evaluations: Oximetry This pi[INVESTIGATOR_158745], for use in oxygen titration and monitoring for clinical care and research purposes.  Therefore the study outcomes are designed to assess the efficacy of the study monitoring itself as well as the intervention of randomization to higher or lower oxygen saturation target ranges for infants with BPD.   For this study, we define intermittent hypoxemia as SpO2<80% for >30 seconds.  In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_158746], we will also report severe IH events, defined as SpO2<80% for >60 seconds.  In the current study, we will utilize 2-second sampling and averaging times.  IH will be measured longitudinally throughout the study period in all participants regardless of home oxygen use.  IH will be reported as weekly average number of events per “night” based on [ADDRESS_184376] are differences between the two groups in incidence of IH at 40 weeks PMA, 3 months CA, and 6 months CA.  In addition, we will report percent of recording time spent <80%, <85% and <90% SpO2 over the study period.  Duration of exposure to supplemental oxygen will be measured as the number of weeks between 36 weeks PMA (the time of formal diagnosis of BPD) and complete discontinuation of supplemental oxygen. This outcome is defined in weeks, not days, because this more closely matches the pace 
    
   [ADDRESS_184377] performed this maneuver after discharge.  To demonstrate successful implementation of our study intervention and monitoring technology, percent of usable data and percent of time with SpO2 in target range over time will be reported.  Time with SpO2 in the target range will be reported as a percent of oximeter recordings with SpO2 in range, out of total recorded time.  These outcomes are key components of demonstrating feasibility of the study intervention for future research and clinical use.   5.2.2 Efficacy Evaluations: Clinical In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], physiologic (oximetry) data are the primary outcomes.  All clinical outcomes/assessments of efficacy are exploratory and descriptive. Methods and timing of measures that will be used to assess efficacy are: Primary Clinical Outcome: Growth in kilograms between 36 weeks PMA and 6 months CA as well as other growth parameters. • Change in Length (cm) • Weight for length • Head circumference (cm) Secondary Clinical Outcomes: • Feeding questionnaire: The questions that will be asked at 3 and 6 months are selected assess feeding skills and estimate caloric intake.  The questions are selected from longer questionnaires administered as part of the Millennium Birth Study, with permission from the author of the original study.(13)  • The ITQOL---SF47- Parent and child quality of life survey: The Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire™ (ITQOL) was developed for use in infants and toddlers at least 2 months of age up to 5 years. The Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire™ (ITQOL) adopts the World Health Organization's definition of health, as a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease. The survey was developed following a thorough review of the infant health literature and a review of developmental guidelines used by [CONTACT_153997]. The ITQOL includes questions that assess the impact of health on both child and parent quality of life. • Medical resource utilization recorded at 3 and 6 months corrected age: medications (including dose, route, frequency, and indication), doctor and emergency room visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (whether or not in ICU, duration, and indication), therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (type and frequency), and home equipment use.  These data will be extracted from the EMR wherever possible and verified with the participant’s parent(s). • Development: Per standard of clinical care, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development- 3rd Edition Screening Test is administered to all children who attend the Neonatal Follow-up Program (NFP) at 6 months corrected age.  (All children eligible for this study will be 
    
   [ADDRESS_184378] of care) Results of this clinical evaluation will be recorded for the study. 5.[ADDRESS_184379] safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_20721], as well as the clinical outcomes as described above.  Potential adverse clinical outcomes based on the prior literature are pneumonia/BPD exacerbations and detrimental effects on parental quality of life.   6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 6.1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoints are the incidence of intermittent hypoxemia (IH, SpO2 <80% for >=30 seconds) and total duration of hypoxia up to 6 months corrected age among infants with BPD randomized to higher versus lower SpO2 target ranges. 6.2 Secondary Endpoints All secondary endpoints in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_158747].  The primary clinical outcome is growth in kilograms between 36 weeks PMA and 6 months CA.  In addition, the study will also report: • The change in other growth parameters - length (cm), weight for length, and head circumference (cm) - between 36 weeks PMA and 40 weeks PMA, 3 months CA, and 6 months CA. • Differences between groups on a standardized feeding questionnaire at 3 and 6 months CA. • Differences between groups in parent and child quality of life at 3 and 6 months CA. • Differences between the groups in health care utilization at 3 and 6 months CA. • Differences between the groups in development at 6 months CA.  • Safety, assessed as differences in growth, re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and any safety events at [ADDRESS_184380] sufficient power to draw definitive conclusions in these exploratory analyses; however, these approaches to the data are likely to be valuable in planning future studies.   6.3.3 Safety Analysis All subjects entered into the study will be included in the safety analysis. The frequencies of AEs by [CONTACT_24975], body system, severity and relationship to study arm will be summarized. SAEs (if any) will be described in detail. 6.4 Sample Size and Power No preliminary data about incidence of IH in infants with moderate or severe BPD are available. Therefore, our sample size is based on extrapolations from the existing studies.  Rhein reported 8.2 +/- 11.5 events of 5 seconds or longer per hour (197 per day) at 36 weeks PMA.(8)  Poets reported a median 88.4 events of 10 seconds or longer per day in the Canadian Oxygen Trial.(7) We assume that fewer than half of these will be longer events that meet our study definition of IH, and estimate that our study participants will have between 20--[ADDRESS_184381] a relative reduction of 30% between the high and low SpO2 target groups if the baseline rate is 30 events per 8 hours. Therefore, our target sample size is 42 children with complete data. Mean weight at 36 weeks PMA based on the Olsen growth curves is 2.8 kg,(14) and mean weight at 6 months CA based on the WHO growth curves is 7.9 kg.(15) Therefore, we assume a mean growth of 5.1 kg in the higher SpO2 group and less weight gain in the lower SpO2 group. The target sample size of 42 children will provide >80% power to detect a mean difference in growth of 0.5kg between the two study groups.  6.5 Interim Analysis Interim analyses will be performed after 10 and 20 participants complete the study observation period (25% and 50%).  The goal of the two interim analyses is to evaluate rates of drop-out, ensure that sufficient useable data are acquired, assess mean rates of IH across the entire population, and review accumulating safety data.  
    
   16 7 STUDY INTERVENTION  7.1 Description We will randomize infants with moderate or severe BPD to lower (target SpO2 of 90-94%) or higher SpO2 target ranges (target SpO2 of >=96%). The study team will then use novel technology to monitor infants starting at randomization, continuing after discharge and until 6 months corrected age, titrating supplemental oxygen to achieve these target SpO2 ranges. All trial participants will be provided with a study oximeter. Families will be instructed to use the study monitor continuously each night or when the baby [CONTACT_158762][INVESTIGATOR_007]. The research monitor will stay in the child’s sleep space and set with alarm limits of 79% and 101% and will be attached nightly when the infant is placed in the bed (in addition to the clinical monitor if prescribed). The research oximeter will be set for [ADDRESS_184382] photoplethsymgraphy (PPG) data at a rate not greater than [ADDRESS_184383] clinical monitors by [CONTACT_158763], which will be set with alarm limits of 88% and 101%, and used with a frequency determined by [CONTACT_158764].  7.1.[ADDRESS_184384] them to facilitate adherence to the study protocol. 8 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 8.1 Clinical Adverse Events Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  8.2 Adverse Event Reporting The Investigator is responsible for recording and reporting unanticipated problems related to research that occur during and after study treatment. Unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others that occur during the course of this study (including SAEs) will be reported to the IRB in accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  8.[ADDRESS_184385] who has received an intervention (drug, biologic, or other intervention).  The occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign 
    
   17 (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. All AEs (including serious AEs) will be noted in the study records and on the case report form with a full description including the nature, date and time of onset, determination of non-serious versus serious, intensity (mild, moderate, severe), duration, causality, and outcome of the event. 8.4 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs.  A severe AE is a major event of its type.  A severe AE does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, nausea which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but would not be an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke, but would be an SAE 8.4.1 Relationship of SAE to intervention The relationship of each SAE to the study intervention should be characterized using one of the following terms in accordance with CHOP IRB Guidelines: definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely or unrelated.  8.5 IRB/IEC Notification of SAEs and Other Unanticipated Problems The Investigator will promptly notify the IRB of all on-site unanticipated, serious Adverse Events that are related to the research activity. Other unanticipated problems related to the research involving risk to subjects or others will also be reported promptly. Written reports will be filed using the eIRB system and in accordance with the timeline below. External SAEs that are both unexpected and related to the study intervention will be reported promptly after the investigator receives the report.  Type of Unanticipated Problem Initial Notification  (Phone, Email, Fax) Written Report Internal (on-site) SAEs Death or Life Threatening  24 hours Within 2 calendar days Internal (on-site) SAEs All other SAEs 7 days Within 7 business days Unanticipated Problems Related to Research 7 days  Within 7 business days All other AEs N/A Brief Summary of important AEs may be reported at time of continuing review 
    
   18 8.5.1 Follow-up report If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow-up report including all relevant new or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed until either resolved or stable.  8.[ADDRESS_184386] the child’s doctor and if necessary bring the child to the emergency room.  Such events will be monitored closely and reported to the IRB as necessary according to the above guidelines about adverse event reporting.  9 STUDY ADMINISTRATION 9.1 Treatment Assignment Methods 9.1.1 Randomization The plan for randomization is described above in section 3.2. 9.1.2 Blinding The plan for allocation concealment is described above in section 3.2.  Given the nature of the intervention to be evaluated participants and research staff will not be blinded to group assignment.  9.2 Data Collection and Management The proposed research will be carried out using, in part, computing facilities available at the PRECISE (Penn Research in Embedded Computing and Integrated Systems Engineering) Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The PRECISE center has a large dedicated facility for embedded system development and prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_158748].  The oximeters each have a port into which a small computer/dongle designed for this study is plugged.  The dongle contains a wi-fi device (“hot spots") that will transmit the data continuously.  The dongle can store data in the case of dropped wi-fi signal. We will transmit SpO2 data and pulse rate, along with some data that indicate the quality of the signal, but not the waveforms. Only oximeters on loan from Masimo will be used for this study. In addition only cellular modems provided by [CONTACT_158765].  The lab provides secure storage in addition to the hardware and computing resources necessary to maintain a large--‐scale monitoring system. The PRECISE center has developed the device that will transmit data from the Masimo monitor to the study team at CHOP wirelessly.  They will maintain these devices and the data transmission throughout the study.  This team will not have access to patient identifiers; data streams will be labeled only with study ID numbers.  However, the data streams will be date and time stamped, which is essential in order to ensure data integrity. PRECISE will then strip dates and may perform analyses on de-identified and coded data set with dates

As mentioned, data may be managed and stored in a password-protected database using the research-focused electronic web-based data capture system REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is a secure software solution and workflow methodology for supporting clinical research databases developed by [CONTACT_158766]. Automated time-stamped backup files are made daily from the replicated database by [CONTACT_158767]. Backup files are encrypted and transferred to the secure CHOP Research Information Systems Storage Area Network (SAN) accessible only to designated personnel. REDCap provides automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to Excel and commonly-used statistical packages. The database will incorporate range and consistency checks to ensure quality control and will signal the presence of questionable items. Only study team members will have access to the REDCap database for data entry under the supervision of and after training by [CONTACT_978].

To maintain confidentiality, participants will be assigned a unique identifier that contains no protected health information. All source documents will have the study identifier only. Access to the identifiers of the coded data will be controlled by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_158734].  Individuals who withdraw from the study after enrollment will be removed from the main study database (s) and placed in to a separate encrypted, password-protected database maintained at CHOP. This file will be deleted at the end of the study. Records will be retained in compliance with CHOP Policy A-3-[ADDRESS_184388] obtaining IRB approval. The investigator will obtain a data use agreement between the provider (the PI) of the data and any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at CHOP) before sharing a limited dataset (PHI limited to dates and zip codes).  9.[ADDRESS_184389] procedures for all data collection methods will be reviewed at the start and periodically throughout the study. Data checks for errors will be performed prior to analysis. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_158750]. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be reported to the CHOP IRB and other regulatory authorities in accordance with federal and other relevant regulations.   In addition, an independent data monitor for the BPD STar study has been identified. This person is a biomedical engineer with expertise in streaming oximetry data and clinical studies of newborn infants utilizing oximetry.  She will be responsible for participating in assessments of data quality as pretain to the oximetry data and analyses.  9.4.2 Risk Assessment Confidentiality. Protected health information will be collected as part of study records, and breaches of this information outside of the study team resulting in loss of confidentially is a potential risk. Every precaution will be taken to secure participants’ personal information to ensure confidentiality. Our institution maintains strict policies, systematic procedures and sufficient resources for data management in compliance with HIPAA and IRB regulations for safeguarding participant information. Electronic data will be stored in secure, password-protected systems. Paper data will be stored in a locked cabinet in the locked Neonatology office suite at CHOP. Participants will be assigned a unique identifier that contains no protected health information. Access to the identifiers of the coded data will be controlled by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_158734].  Saturation Targeting. Targeting high oxygen saturations with supplemental oxygen may be associated with increased pulmonary oxygen toxicity, retinopathy of prematurity, decreased quality of life, without improving neurologic outcomes.  Targeting lower oxygen saturation ranges with less supplemental oxygen may be associated with more epi[INVESTIGATOR_158751]. Subjects will be monitored simultaneously with a clinically indicated pulse oximeter monitor. There are subject discontinuation and study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_158752], in addition to the PI, an independent monitor will conduct data safety monitoring.  Oxygen saturation monitors. Oxygen saturation monitors are routinely used in the NICU and also frequently indicated for home use in infants with BPD. Participants will follow routine clinical routines for frequent site relocation of the oximeter sensors (probes), which will eliminate the risk of any significant skin irritation. The monitor will have an alarm, which will sound if the sensor is not working or if the infant’s oxygen level is too low, which may be bothersome to families. Questionnaires. Risks are not greater than minimal. Completing questionnaires in regards to health behavior activities could potentially be distressing for some parents/caretakers, however it is not likely that these activities will create additional distress beyond that which is already present. 9.4.[ADDRESS_184390] improved symptoms and/or disease management or improved growth and development and decreased cost.

The research coordinator or PI [INVESTIGATOR_158754], HUP, or PAH NICU and has reached at least 34 weeks corrected age. Adequate time to review the consent, consider risks and benefits of participation, and ask questions will be provided. Signed informed consent will be obtained from a parent before a child is enrolled and randomized. 9.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization Potential study candidates will be screened for eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Parent or legal representative of each potential participant will receive a verbal and written explanation of the purposes, procedures and risks of the study. Families will have time to consider participation and make a decision at a later time. A study physician will be available to explain the medical aspects of the study and answer questions during the consent process. Informed consent procedures will occur in the participant’s room or remotely. A combined informed consent-HIPAA authorization document will be used. Parents will have the opportunity to ask questions. The parent or legal representative must provide written informed consent prior to the start of any study activities. Consent will be documented and a copy of consent documents will be provided to the parent or caregiver. Decision not to participate in this study will not affect access to or quality of clinical services. Due to Covid-[ADDRESS_184393] and social distancing that is enforced, we will provide the option to consent parents and enroll subjects remotely in one of two ways – 1) The REDCAP survey method with an eConsent that will be emailed to the parents with telephone and/or video-conferencing to follow, if feasible, to answer questions, and a signed copy returned automatically if they agree, or 2) By [CONTACT_7328] a paper copy of the consent available to the parents ahead of time with either the research team mailing, emailing or faxing the consent or the research team or clinical staff providing a paper copy, followed by [CONTACT_158768]/or video-conferencing or face-to-face to address their questions or concerns. 
    
   22 A valid electronic signature [CONTACT_158771]. The consent form/HIPAA authorization will include instructions to print or save a copy of the page(s) presented on the electronic device. The subject will be able to print (or save) a copy of the consent form (with or without signature). Alternatively, the form could be emailed to the subject. Regardless, the method by [CONTACT_158769], a study physician will be available to explain the medical aspects of the study, risks and benefits of the study, and answer questions during the consent process. A short form will be available and translated into the subjects preferred language during the consent process for participants with limited English proficiency. The short form consent process will not occur remotely or via electronic form. Potential participant will receive a verbal and written explanation of the purposes, procedures and risks of the study.  A translator will be available either in person or over the phone whenever needed. The study summary document and short form consent form (signed by [CONTACT_158770]) will be obtained in person or via fax, scan or email. 9.6.1 Waiver of Assent A waiver of child assent is requested due to the age of the children participating in the study.  9.7 Payment to Subjects/Families Participants will be compensated up to a total of $300 ($50 per month, up to 6 months CA), through a ClinCard (loadable debit card) for their time and inconvenience, given that the study monitor must be used nightly and the family will have at least weekly interaction with the study team. Participants will also receive a BPD Star Tote at discharge to aid in convenient transportation of the study equipment.   [ADDRESS_184394] P, Darlow BA, Finer N, Schmidt B, Tarnow-Mordi W, et al.

 1.0 A Statement of the Objectives and Purpose of the Study.  
1.1 Introduction  
 
Inhibition of  Viral Replication and Reduction of the “Cytokine Storm” with EmphyCorp’s 
Proprietary Compounds - Potential Treatment and Preventative for COVID -[ADDRESS_164539] died in the [LOCATION_002] from complications with 
COVID -19. Comparatively, the CDC has reported a range of 37 -188 deaths annually in children under five 
years of age, from complications caused by [CONTACT_144581].  
 
Potential proa ctive treatments, such as N115 (sodium pyruvate), would be of benefit to all populations, 
especially children that are afflicted by [CONTACT_144582]. In both animal and human trials, N115 reduced viral 
titers (number of viruses), and reduced the number, sympto ms, and severity of seasonal flu respi[INVESTIGATOR_144558], children, diabetic, and patients with COPD by [CONTACT_46431] 52% annually.  
 
In tissue culture studies, in human studies and in animal studies when inhaled or applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897], sodium 
pyruvate inhibited the ability of many viral strains from replicating due to the ability of Sodium Pyruvate to 
increase the synthesis of Nitric Oxide that is needed to kill infections.  
 
Mice studies conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124] . Lupfer at Missouri State University sub stantiated our finding by [CONTACT_144583] N115 in flu (influenza A H1N1 virus) infected mice that decreased morbidity, weight loss, 
proinflammatory cytokines, and decreased viral titers (virus numbers) compared to the Placebo Control. 
Additionally, treat ed mice consumed more chow during infection indicating improved symptoms (same 
results reported in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_144559] -19 study). There were notable improvements in pro -inflammatory 
cytokine production (IL -1β) and lower virus titers (viral numbers) on days [ADDRESS_164540] immune 
response, metabolic pathways and not directly on the virus, our data demonstrate that sodium pyruvate is 
a promising treatmen t option that is safe, effective, and unlikely to elicit antiviral resistance.  
 
Furthermore, they stated “we have preliminary data that suggest it may work similarly during other 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_144560]19/SARS -CoV-2. Proactive treatme nts with sodium pyruvate is 
not toxic and could be of benefit to children that are afflicted by [CONTACT_144584][INVESTIGATOR_4398]”.      
 
Sodium Pyruvate Ameliorates Influenza A Virus Infection In Vivo  - Online Research Posting on 
BioRxiv:

A clinical survey of [ADDRESS_164541] infections after using the 20mM 
sodium pyruvate nasal spray (EmphyCorp, N115).  The number of flu or colds was reduced by 70% in 
Children and approximately 52% in Pregnant Women, Patients with Allergic Rhinitis, Diabetes, and 
Pulmonary Fibrosis.  
 
In numerous human clinical trials (17, phase I, II, III clinical trials) submitted to the  FDA, with Pulmonary 
Fibrosis, COPD and Cystic Fibrosis patients, N115 reduced nasal and  lung inflammation and congestion 
by [CONTACT_144585]-6 cytokine  that causes the so -called cytokine storm  
with no known adverse reaction s. 
 
In a Phase III Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Patients, N115 Non -
Steroidal Nasal Spray demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant increase in Nasal Nitric Oxide, 
FEV-1, SaO2, FVC, FEV -1/FVC  ratios (52%  to 86%), and a significant reduction in coughing, nasal and 
lung inflammation. N115 alleviated the symptoms associated with the COVID -[ADDRESS_164542] been submitted to the FDA to support our NDA Phase III  marketing 
application. Over a million patients in that group were patients with allergic rhinitis and as stated by [CONTACT_1556] 24% of their symptoms were caused by [CONTACT_144586].  
 
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_164543] Description  
N115 i s a sodium -pyruvate -based inhalation  drug.  It has been administered via several 
routes including intravenous, topi[INVESTIGATOR_144561], and as an 
enteral supplementation since it is considered GRAS (Generally Regarded as Safe) by [CONTACT_1622]. 
Sodium pyruvate is used in many p roducts including (Neosporin, Lubriderm, vaginal products, 
Viva Eye Drops, Ringers Solution, human IV solutions, and solutions to store red blood cells by 
[CONTACT_144587], and to store human organs for transplant). Sodium pyruvate has been shown to 
protect n eurons, lungs, hearts, muscles, cerebral metabolism, embryos, eyes, kidneys, cellular 
DNA and membranes from oxygen radical damage. Other approved uses in patients with a 
variety of medical disorders include Friedreich’s disorder; and it is used as a thera peutic solution 
in open heart surgery, kidney surgery, and eye surgery.  
Six different nasal spray formula combinations were tested for safety and efficacy in a 
series of studies with subjects who normally use nasal sprays. The sodium pyruvate 
concentratio ns were 5mM, 10mM, 20mM and 40mM. The sodium pyruvate was delivered in 
sterile sodium chloride solutions of either 0.45% or 0.90%. All formulas reduced inflammation 
in the nasal cavities and otherwise improved the nasal cellular morphology. There weren’t a ny 
adverse events observed.  
Additionally, safety and efficacy were tested for four weeks in patients with pulmonary 
fibrosis  (PF), where it was determined that there was proven efficacy in reducing the conditions 
of PF, while no adverse events were report ed. In a Phase III Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial 
with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Patients, N115  demonstrated a statistically and clinically 
significant increase in FEV -1, SaO2, FVC, FEV -1/FVC ratios (52% to 86%), and a significant 
reduction in cough ing, nasal inflammation, and congestion. Nasal inflammation and congestion 
block the release of nasal nitric oxide.  Blockage of nitric oxide increases the rate and severity of 
infections .  In our human Phase II/III Placebo Controlled Clinical Trials, N115 reduced nasal 
congestion and inflammation.  In additional  six human clinical trials with COPD patients  
submitted to the FDA , N115 demonstrated a significant decrease in nasal and lung inf lammation, 
substantial increases in lung functions, and increase d nitric oxide needed to kill invading bacteria 
and viruses.  These are critical benefits for treating the symptoms of Covid -19, as lung 
inflammation leads to pneumonia and death. Improving lu ng function of Covid -[ADDRESS_164544] disease. In 
recent clinical studies, Nitric oxide is elicited and inhibits viral replication in pi[INVESTIGATOR_144562]. Nasal nitric oxide also produces clinically useful 
bronchodilation  and has been shown to reduce pulmonary fibrosis. Blockage of nasal nitric oxide 
by [CONTACT_144588], reduces the amount of nitric oxide reaching the lungs, which 
reduces critical lung functions, leading to increased lung and nasal infections, a reduced SaO2 
level, reduced FEV -1 levels also leading to mouth breathing and coughing.  Nasal nitric oxide is 
also essential because it 1) increases oxygenation in your blood by [CONTACT_144589], 
which is a vasodilator and bronchodilator that inc reases oxygen transport throughout the body.  
2) Warms, moistens and filters the air.  3)Traps particles in nose hairs and mucous membranes.  
4) Helps reduce the likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_144563], flu, allergies, and irritating cough.  5) 
Prevents nasal dryne ss. 6) Helps relieve stress and calm the body as it slows breathing.  7) 
Promotes healthy digestion. 8) reduces risks of developi[INVESTIGATOR_144564]. Nasal steroids 
and other OTC nasal treatments shut down the synthesis of nasal nitric oxide, which t hen leads to 
decreased lung functions and a 34% increase in infections.  
As cited in hundreds of peer reviewed publications, naturally occurring nitric oxide in the 
nasal cavities is a primary defense in humans; it is needed to kill invading bacteria, fung i and 
viruses. Nasal nitric oxide also prevents and reduces the rate and severity of viral infections, 
viral replication from Rhinoviruses, the Flu, and Coronavirus.   
Nitric oxide decreases significantly from the normal levels found in young healthy adults  
when compared to patients with Asthma, COPD, Diabetes, Cystic Fibrosis, and Primary Ciliary 
Dyskinesia. The rate of infection increases with decreasing levels of nasal nitric oxide.  
1.4 Nasal nitric oxide and COVID -19 infections.  
Nasal Nitric Oxide reduces the rate , duration  and severity of viral infections in healthy 
young children and in healthy adults from the Flu, Rhinovirus and Coronavirus. It’s been 
demonstrated that Nitric oxide is elicited and i nhibits viral replication in pi[INVESTIGATOR_144562].  Nasal Nitric Oxide levels decreases from normal levels found in 
healthy adults, in patients with asthma (87%), COPD (73%) CF (44%) and Primary Ciliary 
Dyskinesia (7%). The rat e of infections increases with decreasing levels of nasal nitric oxide. 
Young children, 6 -17 years of age, produce (142%) more nitric oxide than healthy adults, which 
may explain their resistance to COVID -19. Recently, researchers announced that a high 
percentage of COVID -19 infected patients that were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144565] -
Diabetic . The literature has reported that elevated levels of glucose in patients with diabetes 
mellitus cause a deficiency in the production of nitric oxide by [CONTACT_144590] g nitric oxide synthesis, 
6 
 which may explain their susceptibility to COVID -19. N115 increases nitric oxide and is safe for 
use by [CONTACT_144591].  
As cited in hundreds of peer reviewed publications, naturally occurring nitric oxide in 
the nasal cavit ies is a primary defense in humans. Nitric Oxide is needed to kill invading 
bacteria, fungi and viruses, and prevents/reduces the rate , duration  and severity of viral 
infections, viral replication from the Common Cold, Rhinoviruses, the Flu, and Coronaviru s. 
N115 Increases Nasal Nitric Oxide thus is a preventative to reduce the rate and spread of the 
disease.  
 Most Diabetic, Hypertensives, Pulmonary Fibrosis and Cystic Fibrosis Patients have 
very low nasal nitric oxide which makes them  more susceptible to viruses and lung infections . 
The rate of infection increases with decreasing levels of Nasal Nitric Oxide making them more 
susceptible to all infections including COVID -19. Elevated levels of glucose in patients with 
diabetes mellitus cause a deficiency in  the production of nitric oxide by [CONTACT_144592], which may explain why diabetics have a high susceptibility to COVID -19.  
2.[ADDRESS_164545] studies with SARS -CoV. Based on the 
cells that are infected, COVID -19 can be divided into three phases that correspond to different 
clinical stages of the disease . Stage #1: Asy mptomatic state (Initial 1 –2 days of infection) ; Stage 
#2: Upper airway and conducting airway response (Next few days) , and, Stage #[ADDRESS_164546] positive for Covid -19,   back playing and back to work  
much faster than a 14 -day quarantine and as a Preventative to help  reduce the rate, duration and 
spread of the virus, is critical to the world.  In testing patients with the saliva/sputum test  developed 
by [CONTACT_144593] , it was discovered that some actively infected patients may be asymptomatic, but 
remain infected, in  some cases for three weeks or longer. Thousands of data points have been 
collected with the saliva/sputum tests on the duration of the infection in COVID -19 patients. This 
data will be used as a historical baseline to demonstrate a reduction and duration of the infection in 
patients that use the N115 nasal spray.    
This will be a n on-going trial that will study the effects of a 20mM sodium pyruvate in 0.9% 
sodium chloride nasal spray solution on COVID -19 viral infections  of patients with proven COVID -
19 infections  or those with lingering symptoms after resolution of infection (Long Haulers).  
1. Nasal -pharyngeal swabs that are currently FDA approved for testing COVID -19 patients, 
will be used to determine if an individual is actively infected.  
7 
 2. Covid -19 positive individuals will receive the nasal spray that will be used three times 
per day. This spray will be placebo  control  (15 patients,  0.9% sodium chloride with 
0.02% benzalkonium chloride) or N115 treatment ( 15 patients, 20mM sodium pyruvate 
in 0.9% sodium chloride with 0.02% benzalkonium chloride). Study staff and subjects 
will be blinded.  
3. Patients will return for testing again every other day  to determine how fast the nasal spray 
reduces the viral load and infection, compared to the viral  loads and infection on Day 
Zero, historical baselines, and placebo.   
4. Long haulers, those previously testing positive for COVID19 with chronic symptoms, 
will also be treated with the nasal spray three times per day. Patients in this group will 
serve as self-controls as chronic symptoms vary between individuals. Baseline 
symptoms will be recorded for one week without treatment. Then, 50 or more patients 
will use N115 treatment (20mM sodium pyruvate in 0.9% sodium chloride with 
0.02% benzalkonium chloride)  for one week and continue to monitor symptoms. The 
most common symptoms reported by [CONTACT_144594]: coughing, ongoing, 
sometimes debilitating fatigue, body aches, joint pain, shortness of breath, loss of 
taste and smell, difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], migrain es, headaches, brain fog, hypoxemia, and 
nasal congestion in some patients. If requested by [CONTACT_1962], who have determined that 
the N115 nasal spray relieved their symptoms, more of the N115 nasal spray will be 
provided to them upon conclusion of the 14 -day study.   
 
EmphyCorp Rx N115 Non -Steroidal Nasal Spray increases nasal nitric oxide and has the 
potential of reducing the rate and spread of COVID -19 among healthy individuals, 
diabetics, and others. Nasal steroids and other OTC nasal treatments shut down the 
synthesis of nasal nitric oxide  which increases the rate of infections . This would indicate 
that the use of EmphyCorp’s Rx N115 Nasal Spray by [CONTACT_144595], Children, Pregnant Women, and Diabetics that are currently infected wit h 
COVID -19 without other underlying health conditions, could reduce the rate , duration  
and spread of infection.   
 
3.0 Mechanism of Action  of N115  
Sodium pyruvate is a natural antioxidant, and as an antioxidant has been shown to 
significantly reduce inflammatory agents throughout the human body including the lungs and 
nasal passages. The reduction of inflammatory agents including IL -6 the cause of th e cytokine 
storm in COVID -19 patients. Nasal congestion does not allow nitric oxide to be produced by 
[CONTACT_144596]. A previous study with Pulmonary Fibrosis 
patients clearly demonstrated a significant increase in exhaled  nitric oxide, and since nitric oxide 
has been shown to kill virus, including COVID -19, this trial is being designed to determine if the 
N115 Sodium pyruvate -based nasal spray will i increase in nasal nitric oxide to the extent that 
COVID -19 viral loads ar e reduced or eliminated.  
In over six human clinical trials submitted to the FDA, with pulmonary fibrosis, COPD 
and Cystic fibrosis patients, N115 reduced lung inflammation by [CONTACT_144597]-6 cytokine  that causes the so -called cytokine storm  in COVID -19 
patients and did this with no known adverse reactions.  
8 
 In a Phase III Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Patients, 
N115 Non -Steroidal Nasal Spray demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant increase 
in Nasal Nitric Oxide, FEV -1, SaO2, FVC, FEV -1/FVC ratios (52% to 86%), and a significant 
reduction in coughing, nasal and lung inflammation. N115 increases Oxygen by [CONTACT_144598], and it also reduces lung inflammation, inflammat ory cytokines, and coughing. These 
are critical benefits for treating the symptoms of Covid -19, as lung inflammation leads to 
pneumonia and death.  
 
4.0 Pre-Clinical and Clinical History and Studies  
4.1 Pre-Clinical Experience and Studies  
As part of Cellular Science’s IND submissions, five animal studies were conducted with 
solutions of differing concentrations of sodium pyruvate. These included a "Maximum Tolerated 
Nose Dose" study in rabbits (2000X the therapeutic human dose) and a [ADDRESS_164547] of multiple intratracheal administrations of sodium 
pyruvate on lung injury caused by [CONTACT_144599]. Two weeks after the bleomycin 
insult , there was a significant (p<0.01) reduction in total cells found in the bronchoalveolar 
lavage containing sodium pyruvate, compared to the sodium chloride control, indicating a 
reduction in airway inflammation. It was concluded that sodium pyruvate was effectiv e in 
reducing inflammation and lung damage in this chronic fibrotic stage of lung injury. (It should 
be noted that this type of injury with subsequent fibrotic infiltration is typi[INVESTIGATOR_144566] D-19.)

active primary infections.  
 
5.4. Study Design Overvie w 
Individuals that  are symptomatic  for COVID19 /influenza  will initially be tested by [CONTACT_144603] (Screening Visit) . If positive for COVID19 /influenza , patient 
will then be solicited for participation in the trial within [ADDRESS_164548] the number of 
coughs and other  flu-like symptoms they experience each day . Patients will  be contact[CONTACT_109587]/or sent reminders through a clinical phone app  every two days to review symptoms 
and protocol compliance and patients will be tested  via nasal swab  every other day . This will 
continue every other day until the subject tests negat ive for COVID -19/ influenza  (which is 
defined as a 2 -Log reduction in virus titer  or less than 1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_144568] ) or [ADDRESS_164549] the number of coughs and other flu -like COVID -19 symptoms they experience each day. 
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_103825]/or sent reminders through a clinical phone app every two 
days to review symptoms and protocol compliance. Patients in this group will serve as self -
controls as chronic symptoms vary between individuals. Baseline symptoms will be recorded for 
one week without treatment. Then, patients will use N115 treatment (50 patients or more, 20mM 
sodiu m pyruvate in 0.9% sodium chloride with 0.02% benzalkonium chloride) for one week and 
continue to monitor symptoms. If requested by [CONTACT_1962], who have determined that the sodium 
pyruvate nasal spray relieved their symptoms, more of the sodium pyruvate nasa l spray will be

Tests and analyses will be conducted every other day during the study. If any aberrant values 
occur, the Clinical Coordinator  will determine if that patient should continue  the study or be 
removed. All aberrant values that occur during the study will be considered adverse events.  
 
14.0. Safety Precautions Included in this Study : 
The 20 mM nasal sodiu m pyruvate inhalation has been administered to both healthy humans and 
humans with lung diseases, without the occurrence of any SAE.  
• First administration of nasal spray monitored via telehealth on in clinic . 
• The initial nasal spray will be administere d under the supervision of medical staff.  
• If a subject develops any adverse event during the follow -up period after study drug 
administration, the subject will be treated to a satisfactory resolution before being 
discharged from the clinic.  
• Subjects w ill remain in contact [CONTACT_144607] 30 minutes after the 
initial inhalation of the nasal spray.  
• Follow up telephone communications, as needed.  
• If at any time the patient shows severe signs of disease or complications, they shall be 
removed from the study by [CONTACT_099]  ([CONTACT_144619])  and treated using proven 
methods for COVID19 or flu. These include, but are not limited to, antiviral drugs 
(Tamiflu, remdesivir, etc.) , convalescent serum , oxygen and critical care . Treatment 
decisions will be made by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Abraham, the patient’s physician or an emergency care 
physician as needed.  The patient may also withdraw from the study at any time, and for 
any reason, and seek traditional standard of ca re for COVID19 or flu.  
• Severe signs of disease or complications include abnormal blood pressure  (low or high) , 
resting blood O 2 below 90%, apnea, fever over 103° F, altered mental state, impaired 
renal function, hemorrhaging or other severe symptoms.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_164559] Evaluation Questionnaire . This information will not be collected in the current 
study as it has been collected in numerous prior studies . 
 
16.0 Daily Data Logbook :  
Subjects will use this diary card or a clinical phone app to record the number  of their coughs 
15 
 per day  and flu -like symptoms , any self -perceived adverse events, and any medication 
changes during the study.  
 
17.0 Urinalysis : Samples may be  taken and analyzed to determine if any females  of child 
bearing age are pregnant  
 
18.0 Study Ma nagement  
18.1 Case Report Forms  
Case Report Forms (CRF) will be supplied by [CONTACT_144608].  Data will 
be recorded in the CRFs according to the following:  
Instructions to data entry personnel and Monitor:  
(a)Explain all missing data and include reference to any original data that is not contained in the 
study file. If a space is blank because the item was not done, mark the item “N/A”. If the item is 
not applicable to the individual case, mark the item "N/A”. If an item is unknow n, mark the 
space “UNK". Legibly write or print all entries in black ink. If an entry error has been made, 
draw a single straight line through the wrong entry and enter the correct data above it. Please 
initial and date all such changes. DO NOT ERASE OR OP AQUE OUT ERRORS. For 
clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and 
date the clarification.  
18.2. Data Collection, Management, and Statistical Analysis  
The data management staff at the research clinic and lab  (Trinity Healthcare and Dynamic 
DNA Labs ) will collect and manage the data. Monitoring and auditing of the data will be 
conducted by a staff member of Cellular Sciences  remotely .  
The basic statistical analysis will be repeated measurements of Analysis of Variance using 
baseline measurements as a  covariant per subject. Group comparisons of N115 to placebo will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_144609], Fisher Exact, and other appropriate significance 
tests. Data will be compared to placebo controls and current publicly available matched data and  
observed values compared. Time dependence in viral titer reduction will also be compared.  [CONTACT_144620] will be responsible for the statistical analysis. Analysis will be performed blinded.   
18.3. Study Monitoring  
A Study Monitor who will be responsible fo r auditing data will be appointed by [CONTACT_144610]. The Monitor will visit the clinical site two or three times during the trial to assure that 
all data are being collected and that the Case Report Forms are completed and correctly filled 
out. Alternat ively, virtual visits may be conducted due to COVID19 exposure concerns.  
18.4. Data from Patients Who Withdraw from the Study  
If a subject withdraws from a study, the data collected on the subject to the point of 
withdrawal will remain part of the study da tabase and will not be removed.  
The investigator may ask a subject who is withdrawing whether the subject wishes to provide 
continued follow -up and further data collection subsequent to their withdrawal from the 
interventional portion of the study. Under this circumstance, the discussion with the subject 
would distinguish between study -related interventions and continued follow -up of associated 
clinical outcome information, such as medical course or laboratory results obtained through non -
invasive chart re view and address the maintenance of privacy and confidentiality of the subject’s 
information.  
[ADDRESS_164560]’s informed consent for this limited participation in the study 
(assuming such a situation was not described in the original informed consent form). In 
accordance with FDA regulations, IRB approv al of informed consent documents would be 
required (21 CFR 50.25, 56.109(b), 312.60, 312.66, 812.100).  
If a subject withdraws from the interventional portion of a study and does not consent to 
continued follow -up of associated clinical outcome information , the investigator must not access 
for purposes related to the study the subject’s medical record or other confidential records 
requiring the subject’s consent. However, an investigator may review study data related to the 
subject collected prior to the su bject’s withdrawal from the study, and may consult public 
records, such as those establishing survival status.  
18.5. Product Packaging  
The product packaging has complied with FDA regulations. The nasal spray will be contained in 
a sterile plastic vial tha t can be squeezed to administer the correct dosage. The packaging meets 
21CFR312.6 including the statement "New Drug - investigational use only." The vials necessary 
for each study period (i.e. ~14 days) will be placed in a plastic bag with the patient’s n umber.  
18.6.  Product Storage Requirements  
18.6.[ADDRESS_164561] Retention  
All records will be kept by [CONTACT_144611] a period of three years. After that , they will be sent to 
Cellular Sciences.  
18.8. Additional Studies  
No additional stud ies are planned at this time.  
 
19.0 Reports on Adverse Events  
19.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
CTCAE term ( Adverse event  description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.[ADDRESS_164562] access to a 
copy of the CTCAE version  3.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 3.0 can be downloaded from the 
CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ). 
 
“Expectedness” :  Adverse events can be “Expected” or unexpected.  
Attribution  of the adverse event (Section 4.8.5):  
Definite – The adverse event is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
Probable – The adverse event is likely related to the study treatment.  
Possible – The adverse event may be related  to the study treatment.  
Unlikely – The adverse event is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
Unrelated – The adverse event is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
17 
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any expected or unexpected adverse event  (AE, 
generally equivalent to CTCAE v er 3.0 grades 3, 4 or 5) that is related or unrelated  to the 
intervention that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening event  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (not required as part of the treatment) or 
prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Causes cancer  
• Is an overdose  
 
Certain medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may also be considered a serious adverse event when appropriate medical or 
surgical intervention is necessary to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Unexpected  Adverse Event  - Any event in which the severity or specificity is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the protocol, and the event is not anticipated from the 
subject's disease history or status.  
Expected  Adverse Event  - Any ev ent in which the severity or specificity is consistent with 
the risk information described in the protocol or is anticipated based on the subject's medical 
history.  
Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or that do not result  in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], on the basis of appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
All deaths, regardless of cause, must be reported for patients on study and for deaths 
occurring within [ADDRESS_164563] study drug dose.  
19.2. Examples of Adverse Events  
• Inter -current illnesses  
• Injuries  
• New symptomatology (this does not include symptoms expected as a result o f the 
subject’s condition unless it is beyond what is normally expected)  
• Significant laboratory abnormalities  
• New abnormal physical exam findings  
• Significant exacerbation of pre -existing conditions  
19.3. Recording and Documentation of Adverse Events  
Any adverse event (i.e., a new adverse event or an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition) 
with an onset date after study drug administration should be recorded as an adverse event on the 
Case Report Form (CRF). All adverse events must be recorded on the  appropriate CRF 
regardless of the severity or relationship to study medication.  
An adverse event or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before study drug 
administration is considered to be pre -existing in nature. These pre -existing events, will be n oted 
18 
 in the CRFs.  
All SAEs occurring during this study, whether observed by [CONTACT_099], nurse, or reported 
by [CONTACT_102], will be recorded on the [LOCATION_012] Advanced Medical Research Adverse Events form  
19.4 Investigator Report of a "Serious Adverse Event" to Cellular Sciences  
Cellular Sciences (Sponsor) must be notified immediately regarding the occurrence of any SAE 
that occurs after the first dose of study drug has been administered. The procedures for repo rting 
SAEs are as follows:  
• Complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report.”  
• Email the SAE Report to Cellular Sciences (see below) within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event.  
• These preliminary reports must be followed by [CONTACT_144612][INVESTIGATOR_144570], autopsy reports, and other documents when requested and 
applicable.  
• The contact [CONTACT_144613]:  
Following the  first dose of the drug product, the Investigator or designee must report the 
occurrence of any serious adverse event to Cellular Sciences within one (1) business day, 
regardless of the causal assessment to study medication. A photocopy or facsimile of the  Serious 
Adverse Event page of the CRF must be provided to:

19.[ADDRESS_164565] be reported to the Investigator and IRB  according to definitions and 
guidelines at http://www.infosci.coh.org/ocrqa/forms/guidance.d oc and which are defined herein. 
AEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_36925]. Less than serious adverse events will be reported only at the 
time of protocol continuation reports.  
Cellular Sciences may request additional information from the Investigator to ensure the 
timely completion of accurate safety reports.  
19.6   Attribution  
For reporting purposes, attribution is the assessment of the likelihood that an AE is caused by 
[CONTACT_144614].  The attribution is assigned by [CONTACT_30780]/Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_144571], the medical history of 
the subject, and past experience with the research agent/intervention.  This is recorded using the 
Adverse Event Report (COH AER) form ( http://resadmin.coh.org/doc /irb3820.doc ) in one of 
19 
 five c ategories scored as the following: 5=related, 4=probably related, 3=possibly related, 
2=unlikely related, and 1=unrelated.  
19.7. Post-study Adverse Events  
The Investigator will notify Cellular Sciences of any serious adverse event he/she becomes 
aware of that occurs at any time after a subject has completed study participation, if in the 
Investigator’s judgment the event may be reasonably related to the medication used in the study. 
The Investigator will follow the subject until the adverse event resolves or becomes stable.

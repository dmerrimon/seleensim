Prot ocol Title  A Phase IIa, Open -Label , Multiple Ascending Dose Study to Assess the Safety, 
Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Exploratory Efficacy  
of Vamorolone  in Boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)  
Protocol Number  VBP15 -002 
Name  [CONTACT_120799],  Inc. 
Drug Substance  delta -1,4,9(11) -pregnatriene -17-alpha,[ADDRESS_135126]  vamorolone , 4% suspension for oral dosing  
Phase of 
Development  Phase IIa 
Indication  Treatmen t of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)  
Objectives  Primary : 
1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending oral doses of 
vamorolone  in ambulant boys ages 4 -< 7 years with DMD . 
Secondary : 
1. To investigate the single -dose and multiple -dose pharm acokinetics (PK) of 
oral vamorolone  at multiple dose levels in ambulant boys ages 4 -< 7 years 
with DMD ; 
2. To investigate the effects of single and  multiple oral doses of vamorolone  
on serum pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers in ambulant boys ages 4 -< 7 
years wi th DMD ; 
3. To evaluate metabolites of vamorolone in Metabolites in Safety Testing 
(MIST) assessments following administration of multiple ascending oral 
doses .  
Exploratory : 
1. To investigate the effect of multiple oral doses of vamorolone  on muscle 
strength, mobility , and functional exercise capacity, as measured by 
[CONTACT_120724] (QMT), Time to run/walk [ADDRESS_135127] 
(TTRW), Time  to Stand Test (TTSTAND), Time to Climb Test 
(TTCLIMB), North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), and Six -minute 
Walk Tes t (6MWT)  in ambulant boys ages 4 -< 7 years with DMD . 
Study Design  This Phase IIa study is an open -label, multiple ascending dose study to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and exploratory clinical efficacy of oral 
vamorolone  over the course of a 14-day Treatment Period in ambulant boys 
ages 4 -< [ADDRESS_135128] -
treatment Follow -up Period . 
Note: Subje cts who complete the 14-day Follow -up Period will be given the 
option of continuing vamorolone  treatment in an extension study under a 
separate protocol  (VBP15 -003). 
Approximately 12 subjects  will be enrolled  per dose level at up to four 
ascending dose lev els (unless there are dose -limiting toxicities in 2 or more 
subjects  at a given dose level ) in order to have minimum data for the dose

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL level. If fewer than two of the approximately 12  subjects at any dose  level 
experience a dose -limiting toxicity, followin g review of the available safety 
data for the Treatment and Follow -up Periods for all subjects in the dose cohort 
by [CONTACT_120725], the Study Chair and Medical Monitor 
will jointly decide whether to recommend dose escalation to the ne xt dose 
level.  If two or more subjects at any dos e level experience a dose -limiting 
toxicity, the Medical Monitor an d Study Chair will be notified,  and enrollment 
at that dose level will be halted ; the MTD will be defined as the previous dose 
level, unles s the decision is made to study lower intermediate dose level(s).   
The DSMB will be informed promptly of any dose decisions which are a result 
of dose -limiting toxicities.  
If dose escalation is terminated due to dose -limiting toxicities, the remaining 
dose level groups may be enrolled to evaluate the safety and PK effects of 
vamorolone at lower intermediate dose level (s).  Once safety data from 
additional dose level group(s) are assessed, the MTD will be defined as the 
dose level below the dose at which the  DSMB determines there to be an 
unacceptable risk to subjects.  This plan allows the maximum number of safe 
dose level group s to have sufficient numbers for overall estimates of safety, 
PK, PD and baseline assessments of preliminary efficacy outcomes to be  
followed via an extension study (VBP15 -003).  
Planned Sample Size  A total of up to [ADDRESS_135129] dose -limiting toxicities  and dose escalation is halted .

Testing (MIST) assessment pre -dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_135139] -dose on 
Study Day 14.  Once -daily study drug dosing on Days 2 -13 will occur at home.  
Additional bloo d and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests  will be 
collected  and results will be used  for dose escalation decisions.   In addition, 
samples w ill be collected at scheduled visits througho ut the study to assess 
safety and  PD biomarker levels  (see Section 6.3 for detailed assessment 
schedule).  
A physical examination and 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) will be recorded 
at Screening, Week  2 (Day 14 ), and the final Week 4 (Day 28 ) Follow -up Visit .  
Exploratory clinica l efficacy will be assessed by  [CONTACT_120731], TTSTAND, 
TTCLIMB, TTRW , NSAA,  and 6MWT conducted at Screening  and Baseline, 
Week 2 ( Day 13), and the final  Week 4 (Day 28 ) follow -up Visit.  Vital signs  
will be recorded at each stu dy visit.  Adverse events (AEs) , including serious 
AEs (SAEs) , and concomitant medications will be recorded throughout the 
study.  
Subjects will be discharged from the study followin g completion of all Follow -
up Week 4 (Day 28 ) assessments.  In the event that any clinical or laboratory 
parameters remain abnormal at the time of discharge from the study, the subject 
will be followed medically as clinically indicated . 
Dose Escalation  
Plan, Dose -Limiting 
Toxicities,  and 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_120677], subjects will be enrolled by [CONTACT_120732] 1, to receive vamorolone  at the lowest dose 
level, after completion of all Pretreatment Scree ning and Baseline assessments .  
Dosing will continue through completion of Dose Level Group 4, or until a 
lower  MTD is identified.  If dose -limiting toxicities occur at any time during 
the Treatment or Follow -up Periods, the study design may be modified, i n 
consultation with the Study Chair, Medical Monitor , Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board ( DSMB ), and the Sponsor, depending on the timing and 
nature of the toxicities.   
The Study Chair and the Spons or’s Medical Monitor will jointly review safety 
and availab le PK data for all subjects who have completed the [ADDRESS_135140] completed the 14-day Treatment Period and are being 
monitored in the 14 -day Follow -up Period.  
Clinical AEs and clinical laboratory AEs will be graded according to the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCA E), version 4.03 , 
dated June 14, 2010 . 
Dose -limiting toxicities will be defined as follows:

toxicity will be discussed by  [CONTACT_64362],  the Medical Monitor 
and the DSMB.  The SAE data collection tool must be completed if 
the event also meets the criteria for an SA E. 
If a dose -limiting toxicity occurs in  two or more  subject s in any dose group 
during the Treatment or Follow -up Period s, the Study Chair and Medical 
Monitor will be notified, and enrollment and dosing at that dose level will be 
halted ; the MTD will be de fined as the previous dose level, unless the decision 
is made to study lower intermediate dose level(s).   The DSMB will be informed 
promptly of any dose decisions which are a result of dose -limiting toxicities . 
If dose e scalation is terminated due to dose -limiting toxicities, the remaining 
dose level group s may be enrolled to evaluate the safety and PK effects of 
vamorolone  at lower intermediate dose levels.  Once safety data from 
additional dose level group (s) are as sessed, the MTD will be defined as the 
dose level below the dose at which the DSMB determines there to be an 
unacceptable risk to subjects.

Statistical Methods  Sample Size:  
A sample of [ADDRESS_135147] a confidence interval of 
no wider tha n 50% for the proportion of adverse events assessed or any other 
event outcome.  For the continuous outcomes such as safety laboratory markers 
or pharmacodynamics markers, a two -sided 95.0% confidence interval for the 
mean will be no wider than 0.8 standar d deviation (SD) from the observed 
mean, with 90.0% coverage probability, based on the t statistic; thus, the total 
confidence interval will be approximately 1.6 SDs wide for any continuous 
parameter if its underlying distribution is approximately normal.  
Analysis Sets:  
Safety Population  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of vamorolone  study medication will 
be included in the Safety Population.  
PK Population  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of vamorolone  study medication and 
have sufficien t data for PK analysis will be included in the PK Population.  
Statistical Analysis:  
Owing to the small sample size , no inferential statistical analyses are planned.

1.2 N onclinical Experience 
The safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK) and metabolism, and toxicology of

be
agle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys in vivo.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with cardiomyopathy that can become life

(8-

identified in the other groups (wild type; mdx vehicle, and vamorolone -treated). 
P
harmacologically, glucocorticoid s show im munosuppressive and immunotoxic 
properties that limit therapeutic windows and long-term use.  Vamorolone (5, 15, 30 
mg/kg/day) was benchmarked against prednisolone (5 mg/kg/day) to determine if similar 
pr
operties were observed.15  Untreated mdx mice showed increased numbers of peripheral 
blood l
eukocytes (PBL) and enlarged spleens resulting from ongoing muscle damage 
compared to wild type mice.  Vamorolone treatment reduced spleen mass and PBL

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL counts in a dose-dependent manner.  This finding is attributed to a reduction in muscle 
damage by [CONTACT_120744].  Prednisolone reduced these measures below wild type, suggesting 
im
munosuppressive and/or immunotoxic properties.  Further, prednisolone significantly 
de
creased viable splenocytes per gram of tissue (p 0.005), whereas this decrease was not 
obser
ved for any vamorolone dose tested (ReveraGen Report No. MDX-RBP-VBP15-
02).15 
To f
urther query the potential immune modulation, the effects of vamorolone and 
pr
ednisolone on counts of splenic B and T-lymphocytes isolated from treated mdx mice 
we
re examined.  CD4+ T-cell activation was assayed by [CONTACT_120745] T
-cell mitogen, concanavalin A (ConA).  Splenocytes obtained from prednisolone-
tre
ated mice displayed a significant reduction of the percentage of splenic activated 
C
D4+CD25+ T-cells upon ConA stimulation while splenocytes derived from 
vamorolone-treated mice did not (ReveraGen Report No. MDX-RBP-VBP15-02).  
Ta
ken together, these findings suggest that while prednisolone treatment leads to a 
reduction in T-cell number and activation status, vamorolone modulates inflamed mdx 
im
mune systems towards a wild type state without compromising T-cell activation status.

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL bioavailability (F%) was 74.5%.  Following oral administration of 15  mg/kg via cherry 
syrup, the C max of 1527 ng/mL was observed at 2 hours after drug administration and 
bioava
ilability was 47.7% (ReveraGen Report No. PH- DPMK-VBP-10-004 ). 
Pharmacokinetic results for vamorolone following a single intravenous administration of 
50 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats indicated a CL of 20.2 mL/min/kg. The t ½ was 
0.58 hours.  V ss was 0.77 L/kg, which was similar to that observed in mice.  After oral 
a
dministration of 50 mg/kg in rats, a C max of 2543 ng/mL was observed at 4 hours after 
dose administration, and bioavailability was 47.8% (ReveraGen Report No. PH- DPMK-

Va
morolone clearance was therefore comparable in all 3 species studied

Crl:CD1(ICR) mice were administered vamorolone or vehicle once daily for 
28 consecutive days.  Vamorolone exposure (as assessed by [CONTACT_941] C max and area under the 
c
oncentration-time curve [ AUC ]) increased with increasing dose on Study Days [ADDRESS_135172] values in the 30 and 100 mg/kg dose groups compared to

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL Beagle dogs were either administered vamorolone or vehicle once daily for 28 
c
onsecutive days.  Vamorolone exposure in dogs (as assessed by C max and AUC last) 
generally increased with increasing dose on Study Days 1 and 28.  For the 2 and 10 
mg/kg dose groups, exposure on Day [ADDRESS_135173] values were 2.35-fold and 2.43-fold (males) and 3.03-fold and 3.23-fold 
(f
emales) higher compared to Study Day 1 for the 2 and 10 mg/kg/day dose groups,

Day 1.  At the 50 mg/kg dose, AUC l ast values in males were 1.71-fold lower whereas 
fe
males were 1.22 higher on Day 28 compared to Day 1 (ReveraGen Report No.

a
nd 7 with the exception of male monkeys on Day 7, which showed no clear increase in 
exposure between the 300 and 600 mg/kg/day dose levels.  Repeated dosing over the 
7-day study duration was associated with decreases in mean plasma vamorolone AUC l ast 
values for female and male monkeys indicating possible metabolic induction.  On Day 7, 
mean AUC last values were 1.60-fold, 2.19-fold, and 2.02-fold lower in females and

[IP_ADDRESS] Metaboli sm 
The in vitro  and in vivo  data demonstrate that vamorolone can be metabolized via 
mul
tiple metabolic pathways, including glucuronidation, hydroxylation, and reduction.  
Glucuronidation appeared to be the major metabolic pathway in human cells in vitr o .  All 
meta
bolites observed in human in vitro  were observed in monkey in vitr o.  Most human 
meta
bolites identified in vitro  were also found in mouse and dog.  Thus, there is no 
unique huma
n metabolite identified for vamorolone. 
The
 metabolic stability of vamorolone was assessed in non-Good Laboratory Practice 
(G
LP) studies.  Based on the data generated, vamorolone was highly stable for up to 
60 minutes in human, monkey, dog, and mouse liver microsomes in the presence or 
a
bsence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and stable for up to 
60 minutes in rat liver in the absence of NADPH.  Moderate metabolism was apparent in 
ra
t liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH stimulation (35% remaining), suggesting 
that rat was a high metabolizer of vamorolone relative to other species (mouse, dog, 
human)
 (ReveraGen Report Nos. NIH-R2526, and ADME-VBP- LM- V003 ). 
Vamorolone did not significantly inhibit any of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 
isofor
ms tested (CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4).  Vamorolone 
moder
ately induced CYP3A4 (24% to 42%), indicating that vamorolone is a potential 
induce
r of CYP3A4 (ReveraGen Report Nos. ADME- VBP -Inhibition-V005, ADME-
VBP-Induction-V006, ADME-VBP-Induction-V009 ).

[IP_ADDRESS] S ingle Dose 
Crl:CD1(ICR) mice were administered vamorolone once via oral gavage at 50, 125, 250, 
a
nd 500 mg/kg and observed for abnormalities.  All animals survived to their scheduled 
ter
mination, and there were no significant abnormalities observed.  There was  a slight 
decrease in body weight attributed to vamorolone in both males and females at doses 
a
bove 125 mg/kg.  A dose dependent decrease in food consumption related to 
va
morolone was also observed in males and females.  No other abnormalities were 
obser
ved in experimental mice (ReveraGen Report No. 1998-002).  
B
eagle dogs received single 60, 180, 360, and 750 mg/kg doses of vamorolone using an 
esc
alation study design with a 4-day washout period between doses.  All animals 
survive
d dose escalation.  Clinical signs attributed to vamorolone (750 mg/kg) included 
re
d discoloration of the ears and face.  This effect occurred within a few hours of dosing 
and was transient.  The highest dose also resulted in increased white blood cell count 
(inc
reased neutrophils and monocytes [female only] and decreased lymphocytes and 
eosinophils [male and female]).  At the 360 and 750 mg/kg dose levels, slight elevations 
in albumi
n were observed.  A mild elevation in cholesterol at the 750 mg/kg (and 
possi
bly 360 mg/kg) dose level was also observed (ReveraGen Report No. [ZIP_CODE].01.01 ). 
I
n cynomolgus monkeys, single oral doses of up to 500 mg/kg were well tolerated with 
no significant abnormalities observed (ReveraGen Report No. 1998-001).

a
ttributed to a dosing injury based on the amount of red fluid in the thoracic cavity. 
No e
ffects attributable to vamorolone were observed in food consumption, ophthalmic 
e
xamination, or urinalysis during the study.  Dose-dependent decrease in body weight 
g
ain was observed at all doses; however, weight was fully regained during the recovery 
period.  Adrenal gland weights were variable between groups and generally decreased, 
but wit
hout a dose response relationship, and correlated microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_120683].  After the 2-week recovery period 
ther
e was evidence of vacuolar degeneration of the adrenal gland.  Liver weights were 
sig
nificantly increased at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level.  Hepatocellular hypertrophy, 
incr
eased vacuolation, and necrosis (single cell) were seen in a few male mice at 
30 mg/kg/day.  There was evidence of lipid and glycogen accumulation.  Serum alanine 
a
minotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were higher with associated 
mi
croscopic hypertrophy/vacuolation/necrosis at 100 mg/kg/day.  Spleen weights 
de
creased in a dose-dependent manner and correlated with a decreased number of 
lymphocytes in spleen.  Thymus weights decreased in a dose dependent manner and were 
a
ssociated microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_120684].  Mice had dose-dependent reductions 
in ser
um lymphocytes which were significant in the 100 mg/kg dose group.  After the

covery period, all parameters returned to normal (untreated) except for thymus weights, 
which were increased. 
Based on the liver-related findings in this study, the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) for vamorolone in mice is 30 mg/kg/day (ReveraGen Report No. 1998-009).  
A G

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL There were no vamorolone-related effects on mortality, detailed clinical observations, 
food consumption, ophthalmology, sperm evaluations, or bone lengths (femur or tibia). 
Five test article-treated mice were unscheduled deaths (euthanized in extremis  or found 
de
ad) during the dosing phase.  Three of these were considered to be potentially due to 
dosing injury based on microscopic findings in mediastinum, epi[INVESTIGATOR_120685], or lung.  One 
of these unscheduled deaths was attributed to moderate progressive nephropathy; a 
spontaneous background finding. The death of one male at the 5 mg/kg/day dose was 
unde
termined since there were no major pathologic findings to explain the unscheduled 
death of this animal; there was no target organ toxicity in the mouse.  Target organ 
toxicity was not considered a contributor to the death of these animals and there was no 
dose-relationship in incidence. 
A vamorolone-related increase in body weight gain was observed relative to controls in 
males (+14%) and females (+23%) at the 45 mg/kg/day dose.  Increases in body weights 
at 45 mg/kg/day were not considered to be adverse due to the general health of the 
a
nimals overall.  During the recovery phase, bodyweights in males returned to 
comparable levels as controls, however female body weights remained increased 
compared to female controls. 
Evidence of a minimal to mild vamorolone-related hepatic effects were observed in males 
at doses ≥5 mg/kg/day and females at 45 mg/kg/day, indicated by [CONTACT_120746], alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase 
activities, and/or total bilirubin, as related to microscopic hepatocellular vacuolation,

these
 changes had generally resolved at recovery collections with the exception of 
minimal increases in alanine aminotransferase activity in females at 45 mg/kg/day, which

A mild vamorolone -related decrease in chloride was observed in males at doses ≥ 5 
mg
/kg/day and females at doses ≥ 15 mg/kg/day that lacked correlative findings among 
other
 study endpoints; resolution for this observation could not be determined. 
A mild vamorolone -related increase in albumin was observed in males at doses 
≥ 5 mg/kg/day and females at 45 mg/kg/day with concurrent mild increases in globulin in 
fe
males at 45 mg/kg/day; these changes had resolved at recovery collections. 
A minor va
morolone -related alteration in lipid metabolism was observed in both sexes at 
the 45 mg/kg/day dose and females at the 15 mg/kg/day dose indicated by [CONTACT_120747]/or cholesterol; these changes had resolved at recovery collections. 
Vamorolone-related macroscopic findings occurred in the liver of mice at the 
45 mg/kg/day dose.  Tan discoloration occurred in one female and four males at this dose 
in t
he dosing phase. This correlated with microvesicular/macrovesicular hepatocyte 
vacuolation.  There were no test article-related macroscopic findings in recovery animals. 
Test article-related microscopic findings occurred in adrenal gland (cortical atrophy with 
correlating decreases in adrenal weights in females), liver (increased severity of 
centrilobular hypertrophy; hepatocyte vacuolation; and inflammation/necrosis), lymphoid 
tissues (thymus, spleen, mandibular lymph node, mesenteric lymph node, and gut 
associated lymphoid tissue [GALT]) skin, and pancreatic islets (minimal to mild 
hypertrophy).  Observed changes in these tissues are considered pharmacologically-
mediated and not adverse. 
An increased incidence of decreased anagen hair follicles occurred in mice at the 
45 mg/kg/day dose.  Decreased anagen hair follicles were documented for individual 
a
nimals when there were no anagen hair follicles in the section of skin.  Incidence in 
controls and mice at the 5 and 15  mg/kg/day doses were similar.  A severity score was

There was full reversibility of lymphoid changes in thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph 
node, mandibular lymph node, and GALT.  There no meaningful differences between 
treated animals and controls at the end of the recovery tissues for these lymphoid tissues.  
There was recovery of adrenal gland findings in females and partial recovery of adrenal 
gland findings in males.  In addition, there was partial reversibility of liver findings for 
males and females.  Minor changes persisted in the pancreas and skin. 
Systemic exposure to vamorolone appeared to be sex-dependent on Day 1 (males > 
females) and appeared to be independent of sex on Day 179.  Following daily 
administration of vamorolone in females and males, systemic exposure (AUC 0-24hr) and 
Cmax values of vamorolone increased with increasing dose in a greater than 
dose
-proportional manner on Day 1 and in an approximately dose-proportional manner 
on Day 179.  Systemic exposure to vamorolone in females appeared to increase following 
repeated administration of vamorolone at 5 mg/kg/day, did not appear to change 
following repeated administration of vamorolone at 15 mg/kg/day, and appeared to 
de
crease following repeated administration of vamorolone at 45 mg/kg/day.  Systemic 
e
xposure to vamorolone in males appeared to decrease following repeated administration 
of vamorolone. 
The once daily administration of vamorolone via oral gavage to mice for 26 weeks at 5, 
15, and 45 mg/kg/day did not produce any adverse effects.  Therefore, the NOAEL is 
c
onsidered to be 45 mg/kg/day under the conditions of this study.

vacuolation of the adrenal cortex, increased white blood cell and neutrophil counts, and 
decreased eosinophil counts.  Liver weights increased in the 50 mg/kg/day dose group,

re
covery period. 
The NOAEL was considered by [CONTACT_47990] 10 mg/kg/day.  Although 
re
versible, the liver changes were considered adverse at 50 mg/kg/day because the 
severity score was moderate and the changes were diffuse in nature in all animals treated 
at the high dose.  This determination is in contrast to the conclusion drawn by [CONTACT_120748], who considered the NOAEL to be 50 mg/kg/day due to reversibility 
following cessation of dosing (ReveraGen Report No. [ZIP_CODE]).  
Va
morolone or vehicle was administered to beagle dogs once daily for 39 weeks at doses 
of
 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day.  Six dogs of each sex received each dose or placebo, and two

4 weeks to evaluate reversibility, progression, or delayed appearance of any observed 
c
hanges.  One male dog who received 50 mg/kg/day was euthanized in extremis on Day 
273 due to paraphimosis (an extended penis).  All other animals survived to their

reversible increases in average mean food consumption, relative to controls, over the 
course of the 39-week dose phase were observed in both sexes at 10 and 50 mg/kg/day.   
No test article-related ophthalmological effects were noted.  No test-article- related

mild dose related reversible increase in the heart rate at the terminal post-dose interval 
that was significantly different from vehicle in both sexes following the 50 mg/kg/day 
dose.
  Semen analysis/evaluation for test article affects could not be conducted as there 
were not enough viable samples collected. 
Test article-related effects on clinical pathology endpoints with microscopic correlates 
included the following: 
 A hepatocellular and hepatobiliary effect in males at 10 mg/kg/day and both sexes 
at 50 mg/kg/day, which included increased alkaline phosphatase, gamma 
g
lutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase 
activity.  These changes correlated with microscopic changes in the liver, bile 
duct and gall bladder.  This spectrum of changes was considered adverse in both 
sexes at 50 mg/kg/day.   
 The re was also evidence of an inflammatory response in both sexes at 
50 mg/kg/day, which included increased total leukocyte, neutrophil and monocyte 
c
ounts, and increased fibrinogen and/or globulin concentrations.  The 
inflammatory response was likely secondary to inflammation in the liver 
associated with hepatocellular necrosis.  Platelet counts were also increased in 
both sexes at 50 mg/kg/day and may have been secondary to the inflammatory 
re
sponse. 
Following a 4-week recovery period, all noted clinical pathological changes resolved, 
with the exceptions of increased alanine aminotransferase activity in both sexes at

for
 the epoxide moiety, and VBP15-B-2, which has a 21-acetate substitution (vamorolone

1.3.1 Phas e I Study in Healthy Adult Volunteers 
Clinical experience is limited to a single Phase I clinic al trial of vamorolone  in healthy  
adult volunteers (VBP15 -001).  Th is s tudy evaluated the  safety, tolerability, and PK of 
vamorolone  in a P hase I randomized, placebo -controlled, double- blind, single ascending 
dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study .  In the SAD portion of the study, 
Cohorts 1 through 5 and Cohort 7 were comprised of eight  subjects each; six subjects in 
e
ach cohort received  a  single oral dose of vamorolone  (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3  mg/kg, 1.0  mg/kg, 
3.0 mg/kg, 8.0 mg/ k g, and 20  mg/kg, respectively) and two subjects in each cohort

dose 
of 8.0 mg/kg vamorolone  within 30 minutes of beginning a high fat/high calorie 
mea

re
ceiving 14 daily doses of vamorolone  (1.0, 3.0, 9.0 and 20.0 mg/kg/day).  The  clinical 
conduct for a ll seven SAD cohorts, and all four MAD c ohorts has b een completed ; data 
analysis is ongoi ng. 
The primary objectives of the Phase I study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
sing
le and multiple oral doses of vamorolone, and to evaluate the PK of single doses and 
multiple doses of vamorolone.  A secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of food 
on the a
bsorption and PK of vamorolone.  Other objectives were to obtain samples from 
subjects on Day 1 (pre-dose) and Day 14 of the MAD cohorts for use in Metabolites in 
Safety Testing (MIST) assessments, and to test back-up PK samples from a subset of 
MAD subjects for pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers.

The Phase I MAD treatment plan was discussed in light of the initial PK data.  The 
re
latively short half-life of vamorolone (2-4 hours), coupled with the planned daily dose 
sc
hedule, would be expected to give PK data on each single dose, not cumulative dose, as 
the dosing
 interval was > 5 × t ½.  Thus, the MA D component would be a study of 
individual daily doses, rather than dose-related accumulation and pharmacodistribution 
related to cumulative drug exposure.  In other words, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_120693] a MAD study is to 
determine steady state drug levels after multiple doses; yet with the short half-life of 
vamorolone, useful information would not be expected to be gained with the current daily

 F or the MAD cohorts, there were no AEs precluding further escalations in dosing.   
 R egarding the primary target organ, liver, one subject on placebo  in the 1.0 
mg/kg/day cohort and one subject on vamorolone in the 20 mg/kg/day cohort 
show ed mild elevations of liver enzymes, and drug dosing was halted.  No subjects 
in t
he 3.0 or 9.0 mg/kg/day MAD cohorts showed elevations of liver enzymes. 
 S afety PD biomarker studies showed that vamorolone had an improved safety 
window for adrenal axis suppression (100-fold increase in therapeutic window), and 
no evidence of insulin resistance, compared to prednisone studies reported in the 
literature. 
The results show that the half-life of vamorolone is very similar to glucocorticoids, such 
a
s prednisone.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120698]-life, prednisone is typi[INVESTIGATOR_120699] (including DMD), and once daily dosing is also proposed for 
vamorolone.  Previous studies of increasing the frequency of drug administration of 
glucocorticoids have shown that this has increased side effect profiles without a 
significant gain in efficacy.  Thus, the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids may be 
related to the short-term (pulsed) daily drug exposure.  As vamorolone is thought to share 
a
 similar anti-inflammatory mechanism of action as glucocorticoids (NF- κB inhibition), it 
is felt that the daily pulsed exposure in the Phase I MAD is most relevant to the planned 
c
linical trials in DMD including the Phase II MAD and Phase II efficacy/safety studies, 
where daily dosing schedules will be followed.  The option of increasing the dosing 
re
gimen in the Phase I MAD to better study drug accumulation and steady state PD was 
considered, but this was felt to be unrelated to planned Phase II trials, and drug 
mec
hanism of action.

assessment of vamorolone is in the SAD/MAD study (VBP15-001) and is providing an 
ini
tial clinical assessment and assessment of the PK characteristics of vamorolone 
following administration of an oral suspension of vamorolone in healthy adult subjects.  
W
hile there are likely to be some differences between adults and children, and between 
healthy and DMD subjects, the data from VBP15-[ADDRESS_135183], dose proportionality and variability between subjects. 
The
 current study is designed to determine the safe and tolerable dose(s) to enable future 
studi
es with chronic administration in DMD subjects, ages 4-< 7 years.  The narrow age 
window f
or this study is driven by [CONTACT_71411]: 1) the average age of diagnosis is still 
a
pproximately 4.8 years due to lack of screening programs; 2) the c urrent standards of 
clinical care in Western countries, where glucocorticoid therapy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_120700] 5 and 7 years of age for DMD patients; and 3) the obse rvation that peak function 
for DMD patients occurs at around 7 years (after which time most affected males with 
DMD will begin to decline), all of which result in a narrow age window to identify 
ster
oid-naïve males with DMD.  
The starting dose level of 0.25 mg in this study is one quarter of the dose of 1 mg, which 
wa
s administered to healthy adult males in the MAD, resulting in an AUC 0 -24hr of 
794 ng x hr/mL on Day 14. The maximum proposed dose in this study of 6 mg/kg is 
lowe
r than the 9 mg/kg dose administered to healthy adult males in the MAD which  
resulted in an AUC 0-24hr of 4366 ng x hr/mL, which is the lowest dose at which possible 
a
drenal suppression was seen..  Thus, this range of doses seems appropriate to test in the 
first- in-patient study of vamorolone.29 
Key safety parameters in conjunction with PK data will be evaluated during the course of 
the study to assess vamorolone safety and tolerability. 
P
lacebo has not been included in this initial study in DMD for the following reasons:  
1) AE incidence versus placebo will have already been assessed for both single and

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL multiple doses in the prior SAD/MAD study VBP15-001; 2) the rarity of this disease 
makes it difficult to recruit large numbers of patients across the entire program; 3) as 
spec
ified above, the patient pool is reduced further due to the narrow window of 
opportunity to enroll DMD boys not yet receiving glucocorticoids between the ages of 4 
and 7 years; and 4) there are increasing numbers of DMD clinical studies using drugs of 
diff
erent modalities, all competing for the same population, i.e., those boys most likely to 
benefit and show a response.  
The
 trial design includes the study of acute and chronic responses of PD biomarkers 
be
nch-marked against historical prednisone PD biomarker data.  Acute responses in the 
P
hase I study (hours after a single dose) will be studied in back-up PK samples on Day 1, 
to g
enerate data on 17-hydroxyprogesterone and ACTH (adrenal axis suppression), 
insul
in and glucose (insulin resistance), and osteocalcin (bone turn over), and data 
c
ompared to prednisone-treated subjects in Kauh et al. (2012).25  Chronic responses of 
PD biomarkers will be studied after 2 weeks of vamorolone treatment, and 2 weeks of 
wash out
.  Samples will be studied for glucocorticoid-responsive biomarkers in DMD 
pa
tients previously defined in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research 
Group (CINRG) Duchenne Natural History Study.30  Exploratory PD biomarkers 
e
xamining tissue breakdown and repair will also be evaluated. 
The rationale for assessing acutely -responsive glucocorticoid  PD biomarkers (back -up 
PK samples) is as follows.  Kauh et al. (2012)25 reported acutely-responsive serum 
glucocorticoid biomarkers after a single morning fasted dose of prednisone (dose groups: 
0, 0.13 mg/kg, 0.33 mg/kg, 0.8 mg/kg) in adult volunteers. 
They found that established biomarkers for known safety signals for glucocorticoid s 
showe
d marked changes in blood levels within a few hours of a single dose of 
prednisone.  These included: 
 R eductions in ACTH with all doses, reflecting adrenal axis suppression  
 Increased insulin and glucose with all doses, reflecting  impaired insulin 
suppre
ssion of hepatic glucose production, and insulin resistance

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  De creased osteocalcin (bone turnover marker) at all doses, reflecting 
perturbations of bone remodeling 
Nonclinical studies of vamorolone  treatment of mic e  have shown that va morolone  does 
not show the glucocorticoid  PD signal s of adrenal axis suppression, insulin resistance, 
and increased bone turnover.  Thus, we anticipate that DMD patients will similarly not 
show these same  PD signals.  To monitor the glucocorticoid PD biomarkers reflective of 
adrenal axis suppression, insulin resistance, and bone turnover, serum samples from this 
Phase II study of vamorolone  in young DMD boys will be assayed for these same 
biomarkers as in the studies by [CONTACT_120753].  (2012 ).25 
In addition to these acutely -responsive glucocorticoid biomarkers, a panel of biomarkers 
in DMD patient sera that show response to chronic (~4 month) treatment with 
glucocorticoids has been identi fied.  These chronic prednisone PD biomarkers were 
discovered through study of serum samples of DMD patients enrolled in the CINRG 
Duchenne Natural History Study .  SomaScan aptamer panels testing 1,200 serum proteins 
were used to discover a candidate set o f prednisone -responsive biomarkers ; a subset of 
these  were  validat ed in a longitudinal sample set (individual DMD patients pre/post 
steroid treatment).  These PD biomarkers were assigned to a safety panel or efficacy 
panel based on comparison to normal con trols and information concerning the function of 
each protein (Table 4).  All safety biomarkers were validated in a separate cohort of 
pediatric inflammatory disease patients (longitudinal pre/post steroids).  The same 
SomaScan assay will be used on the chronic samples from the vamorolone Phase IIa trial 
(entry, 2 weeks treatment, 2 weeks washout), with initial data analyses limited to those 
validated biomarkers shown ( Table 4).

Enrolled subjects will receive all doses of vamorolone under the supervision of trained 
stud

the 
participating study site; all other doses will be administered at home.  Study drug will 
be administered by [CONTACT_120728] a volumetric syringe.  Following administration of the 
dose of study drug, the syringe will be filled once with water and the water will be 
administered by [CONTACT_120729].  The subject will then drink 
approximately 50 mL (approximately 2 ounces) of water to ensure the full dose has been 
ingested.  Subjects should receive each dose of study medication at approximately the 
sa

c
onsume an 8 ounce glass of whole milk (or equivalent high fat food portion) each day 
prior to dosing during Study Days 2-13.  There are no other food or drink restrictions 
during
 the study. 
The dose per subject (in mg) throughout the Treatment Period will be calculated based on 
the recorded Screening weight of the subject (in kg) (see App endix 15.1  for dose 
calculation worksheet).  All missed or incomplete doses will be documented.  The

5.4 Rat ionale for Dose Selection 
Escalating doses of 0.25 mg/kg, 0.75 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, and 6.0 mg/kg of vamorolone 
were chosen for this study to ensur e the  safety of subjects enrolled in the study, to allow 
de
monstration of PD effects, and to ensure adequate safety in future clinical studies.  All

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL dosing will be done in the morning with a glass of whole milk (8 ounces or 230 mL) or 
sim
ilar fat equivalent meal (approximately 8 grams fat).  Dose escalations are 2- to 3-fold 
incr
eases for each subsequent dose level group. 
The
 rationale for the starting dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day with a g lass of whole milk is as 
follows.  As P
hase II dosing in 4-< 7 year old DMD children will be done at home in the 
morning, challenges were considered with participant and parent compliance with either 
fasting in the morning (prior to school or other activities), or a rigid prescribed diet of 
known fat content.  To balance compliance with appropriate assessments of 
bioavailability and monitoring of safety, it was decided to administer morning doses at 
home w
ith a glass of whole milk (approximately 8 grams of fat) or similar fat content 
mea
l. 
From the Phase I study in adult volunteers (VBP15-001), a high fat diet (40 grams) 
incr
eased bioavailability of vamorolone (8.0 mg/kg/day) by 250% compared to the fasted 
c
ohort at this dose.  Because a formal food effect study has not been done, it must be 
a
ssumed that any fat intake with drug delivery has the potential to have a 250% increase 
in bi
oavailability vs. the fasted state.  Thus, a conservative approximation of vamorolone 
dr
ug exposure in DMD children when taken with a whole glass of milk is 250 % of the 
fasted bioavailability.  A starting dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day with a glass of milk would be 
e
quivalent to 0.625 mg/kg/day fasted, and this starting dose is 3.1% of the highest safe 
dose 
tested in adults (20.0 mg/kg/day fasted ). 
A starting dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day, with four dose groups increasing by 2 to 3-fold 
incr
ements, leads to dose groups of 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day.  The highest dose 
teste
d, 6.0 mg/kg/day, will similarly be given with a glass of milk, with an expected 
incr
eased bioavailability of 250%, or equivalent to 15.0 mg/kg/day fasted.  As 20.0 
mg
/kg/day fasted in adult volunteers was shown to be safe in the Phase I adult volunteer 
study, the proposed highest dose in 4-< 7 year old children is approximately 75% of the 
hig
hest safe adult dose.  Based on the Phase I PD  biomarker safety data presented in 
Section 1.3, safety signals reflective of insulin resistance are not anticipated at any of the 
planne
d Phase IIa doses.  Also based on the Phase I data, regarding the safety signal o f

8.1 Overall Benefit/Risk 
The current study is a Phase IIa study in young boys with DMD.  It is anticipated that the 
side effect profile of the investigational product will be more favorable than standard of 
care glucocorticoid s in the long term.  The short-term side effects over the 14-day 
treatment period are not currently known but are predicted to be benign based on Phase I 
14-day treatment in adult volunteers.  In the Phase I study, no SAEs were observed in any 
c
ohort.  Cohorts tested in the MAD portion of the Phase I study were 1.0, 3.0, 9.0 and 
20.0 mg
/kg/day for 14 days.  I n the Phase I clinical trial in adult volunteers, vamorolone 
ha

A protocol violation is a deviation from the IRB/IEC-approved protocol that may affect 
the subject’ s rights, safety, or well-being and/or the completeness, accuracy and 
reliability of the study data.  This includes examples such as inappropriate consent, errors 
in 
drug dosing, or lack of reporting of safety data. 
11.3.2 R eporting Deviations/Violations 
Upon discovery of a major protocol deviation or violation, the Investigator is responsible 
for reporting protocol deviations or violations to the IRB/IEC and Sponsor or designee 
(Coor
dinating Center) within [ADDRESS_135304] the shorter of the 
following two time periods: 
 Two years after FDA approval of the drug for the indication for which it was 
investigated, or 
 I n situations where no application is to be submitted or an application is not 
approved for such indication, 2 years after the Investigational New Drug (IND) 
Application is discontinued and the FDA is notified. 
The
 Investigator must maintain a copy of all data collected for each subject treated 
(including eCRFs and source data).  In order to assure the accuracy of data collected in 
the eCRF, it is mandatory that representatives of the Sponsor, or designee, as well as 
representatives of the FDA or other health authorities have direct access to original 
source documents (e.g., subject records, subject charts, and laboratory reports).  During 
the review of these documents, the anonymity of the subject will be respected with strict 
adherence to professional standards of confidentiality.

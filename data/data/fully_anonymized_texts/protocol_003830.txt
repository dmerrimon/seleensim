 1.0 Background  & Rationale  
 
A. Significance  
 
A1. Diabetes, prediabetes, and depression are highly prevalent, disabling, and deadly.  
Diabetes and prediabetes affect 31 million (12%) and 82 million (34%) U.S. adults, 
respectively.1,2 The ramifications of diabetes include CVD, renal disease, amputations, 
blindness, neuropathy, reduced functional status, and death.1,3,4 These statistics highlight the 
need for new prevention targets and approaches, especially for T2D, to augment current 
efforts.5 The lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is 16%.[ADDRESS_3955] risk factor for 
diabetes.  
Twenty years of evidence shows that depression is a diabetes risk factor, independent of 
established diabetes risk factors. A 2013 meta -analysis14 (23 studies) found that depressed 
adults have 56% (unadjusted) and 38% (adjusted for established risk factors) greater ri sk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_4240]. This risk conferred by [CONTACT_4290], as it is on par with established diabetes risk factors, such as smoking.15-17 In addition 
to clinical diabetes onset, a 2013 meta -analysis18 (18 studies) revealed that depression is 
associated with insulin resistance, a sign of prediabetes. This finding supports intervening on 
depression at the prediabetes stage. Finally, the depress ion-diabetes relationship is robust, as it 
has been observed in major demographic groups.8,10,14 A 2008 meta -analysis10 found that risk 
ratios for depression predicting diabetes were comparable for women (1.26), men (1.57), older 
adults (1.50), younger adults (1.96), samples with higher minority representation (1.79), and 
samples predominantly White (1.65).  
 
A3. The depression -to-diabetes relationship is biobehaviorally plausible.  
Although the exact pathways through which depression contributes to diabetes 
development have yet to be determined, several candidate mechanisms have been identified. 
The leading biological mechanisms are HPA axis hyperactivity, autonomic dysfunction, and 
systemic inflammation. Substantial literatures indicate that depression is ac companied by [CONTACT_4291]19,[ADDRESS_3956] a 58% greater risk of future obesity,9 a major T2D risk factor.31 
Maladaptive behaviors common in depressed people – i.e., high calorie diets,32-35 physical 
inactivity,36 smoking,36,37 and nonadherence to medical regimens38,39 – also promote insulin 
resistance and T2D.14,17,18,[ADDRESS_3957] through which many candidate mechanisms promote 
insulin resistance and T2D.  
 Our team's published studies further support the biobehavioral plausibility of the 
depression -to-diabetes relationship. We have found that: (1) depression is positively associated 
with the inflammatory markers interleukin -6 (IL-6) and C -reactive protein (CRP) and predicts 
inflammatory marker increases over 6 years;41-43 (2) depression predicts future obesity 
development;44 (3) depression is linked with poorer adherence to primary prevention 
recomme ndations;45 and (4) depression is positively associated with insulin resistance and 
IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/[ADDRESS_3958] a modifiable diabetes risk factor that is going underdetected or 
undertreated.  
In primary care, the prevalence of depression is 16 -19%.48,[ADDRESS_3959] -line interventions other than 
antidepressants are often not available, and the outcomes achieved are suboptimal,50 there is a 
large cohort of primary care patients with an underdetected or undertreated diabetes risk factor. 
This status quo could represent a major missed opportunity to prevent T2D.  
 
A5. There is a need to evaluate if depression treatment is a new diabet es prevention 
strategy.  
The state of the science (see A2 and A3) and the status quo (see A4) create the current 
need for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4241] a new diabetes 
prevention strategy. Because no such  trial has b een conducted, it is unknown if depression 
treatment improves A1c and prevents T2D in people with prediabetes. Even so, three smaller 
studies provide initial indirect support for such an approach. In [ADDRESS_3960] support. In 18 depressed patients without diabetes, we 
found that those randomized to computerized CBT for depression, vs. usual care, exhibited 
improvements in fasting glucose (see C1). Unfortunately, none of these studies was designed to 
test our hypotheses. First, some used pre/post designs with no randomization or control 
group,[ADDRESS_3961] of 64 depressed patients 
with prediabetes (1) to determine the preliminary efficacy of our depression intervention 
(eIMPACT -DM) on A1c and insulin resistance and (2) to explore whether somatic depressive 
symptoms moderate the intervention effect on  A1c and insulin resistance.  
The scientific premise of the proposed trial is strong , as: (a) current diabetes prevention 
approaches have only partial effectiveness;5,54-56 (b) the depression -to-diabetes relationship is 
independent of established diabetes risk factors, is clinically important (i.e., of sufficient 
magnitude that effective intervention could meaningfully lower diabetes risk), is robust, and is 
biobehaviorally plausible (see A2 and A3); (c) many patients have a modifiable diabetes risk 
factor (depr ession) that is going underdetected or undertreated (see A4); (d) initial evidence, 
including our post hoc analysis, suggests that depression treatment can improve insulin 
resistance and fasting glucose (see A5 and C 1); and (e) o ur preliminary data suggest s that 
depressed people with somatic depressive symptoms are a subgroup at particularly elevated 
diabetes risk (see C 3). 
 
A6. Establishing that depression treatment reduces diabetes risk would have a major 
positive impact.  
A positive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4242] R01 -level RCT by [CONTACT_4292]: (1) generating critical proof -of-concept data  (depression treatment can improve A1c) 
to support the premise; (2) providi ng preliminary effect sizes  for eIMPACT -DM on diabetes risk 
markers to help justify future power analyses; (3) identifying a potentially important moderator  
IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/2021   Page 5 of 34 
 (somatic depressive symptoms) of eIMPACT -DM efficacy. If evidence of moderation by [CONTACT_4293], it would have implications for recruitment (enroll 50% with 
and 50% without these symptoms), randomization (stratify on presence of these symptoms), 
and the sample size (ensure sufficient power to detect [ADDRESS_3962] interactions) of the future RCT.  
Ultimately, demonstrating that depression treatment reduces diabetes risk would have a 
major positive impact . In the scientific domain, it would identify depression as a causal diabetes 
risk factor. In the clinical domain, i t would identify a n ovel target for prevention efforts, likely 
leading to the inclusion of depression in diabetes guidelines.  Moreover, it would equip 
healthcare providers with a new intervention (eIMPACT -DM) to simultaneously treat depression 
and lower diabetes risk for a la rge cohort of high -risk patients. Finally, positive results – 
combined with our practical, s calable intervention – would facilitate dissemination and 
implementation of eIMPACT -DM. These three clinical practice changes should reduce diabetes 
morbidity, mort ality, and costs.  
 
B. Innovation  
 
B1. Our trial would be the first to evaluate depression treatment as a diabetes prevention 
strategy.  
This RCT would be the first to test the effect of a depression intervention on A1c in 
depressed people with prediabetes. Our focus on a psychological factor is a major departure 
from current prevention efforts.[ADDRESS_3963] Trial (see C2 ) has incorporated computerized CBT. 
Moreover, no trials have used an antidepressant algorithm optimized for diabetes risk reduction. 
To achieve our long-term goal, large -scale dissemination and implementation must be possible. 
eIMPACT -DM fits very well in primary care, where behavioral health staff and space are limited, 
as it harnesses technology to minimize personnel and space requiremen ts. In addition, because 
eIMPACT -DM uses computerized CBT, it is more scalable, easier to deliver with high fidelity, 
and likely more cost effective59 than current collaborative care models.  Finally, eIMPACT -DM 
can reach patients with logistical barriers, as many components are internet or  phone delivered. 
Pew data show that 89% of adults (87% for non -Hispanic Blacks; 81% for lower income 
households) use the internet.  
 
B3. Using a statewide information exchange to identify incident T2D is unique and has 
advantages.  
The Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC),60,61 the nation’s largest clinical data 
repository,  is a secure statewide health information exchange operated by [CONTACT_4294]. 
In addition to extensive data provided by [CONTACT_4295], INPC gathers data from I ndiana 
Medicaid and commercial payers and death data from the Indiana State Department of Health. 
Advantages of using INPC seen in our past studies62-64 are an easily extended follow -up and 
minimal attrition (no patient participation required).    
 
C. Preliminary Studies  
 
C1. The Beating the Blues  for Your Heart Trial (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_4243]; Study Registry ID: [REMOVED])  
This small pi[INVESTIGATOR_4244] -of-concept data . Although its primary outcome 
was a CVD risk marker, it allowed for a  diabetes -related post hoc analysis. 29 Eskenazi Health 
IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/2021   Page 6 of 34 
 primary care patients with depression were randomized to Beating the Blues (BtB) – an 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_4245]  – or usual primary care for depression. 22 patients 
(76%)  attended the [ADDRESS_3964] -treatment visit. For this analysis, we selected the 18 patients 
free of diabetes to parallel the targeted prediabetes population. BtB patients ( -3.6 mg/dL), vs. 
usual care patients (+3.2 mg/dL), exhibited greater improvements in f asting glucose (see table ). 
While this difference fell short of significance due to low power, the effect size of d=0.90 is 
large.65 BtB patients also showed large improvements in SCL -20 depression score, moderate -
to-large improvements in CRP , and moderate improvements in IL -6 (see table).  
The major limitation of these data is the fasting glucose outcome, whi ch is a point 
estimate of glycemia highly susceptible to acute influences.[ADDRESS_3965] Trial (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_4243]; R01HL122245; Study Registry ID: [REMOVED])  
This phase II RCT provides data supporting the feasibility of r ecruitment, intervention, 
and assessment and the efficacy of eIMPACT -DM for depression . The eIMPACT Trial's 
objective is to determine if  treating depression, before CVD onset, reduces CVD risk. We 
randomized Eskenazi primary care patients with depression and CVD risk factors to eIMPACT  
or usual primary care for depression. eIMPACT is identical to the proposed intervention , except 
the antid epressant algorithm is optimized for CVD risk reduction . We are now in Year 4. We 
have met our recruitment goal by [CONTACT_4296] 216 patients (56% non -White) and have 
executed the intervention/usual care procedures with high fidelity and minimal impact on cl inic 
operations. Attrition has been low, with 93% of the intervention arm and 91% of the usual care 
arm attending the [ADDRESS_3966] patients ( -7.0 points), versus usual care 
patients ( -3.5 points), showed significantly greater and moderate -to-large improvements in 
PHQ -9 depression score ( see table) . The clinical response data yielded similar results – 51% of 
eIMPACT patients, versus 20% of usual care patients, had a 50% PHQ -9 reduction.  
While these results establish the feasibility of our approaches and the efficacy of our 
intervention for depression , this ongoing trial is not appropriate for achieving our aims for three 
reasons: (1) the sample is problematic (~1/[ADDRESS_3967] diabetes), (2) the antidepressant algorithm 
(optimized for CVD risk reduction) includes medications that could increase weight and A1 c, 
and (3) we cannot assess A1c (no whole blood samples).   Beating the Blues

C3. Somatic Depressive Symptoms and Elevated Diabetes Risk  
Our evidence suggests that depressed people with the somatic symptoms of 
hyperphagia (increased appetite/weight) and/or hypersomnia (increased sleep) may be a 
subgroup at particularly elevated diabetes risk. First, in our analysis of the NESARC data 
(N=17, 787), we found that depressed adults with hyperphagia and hypersomnia had a greater 
odds (OR=1.51; p<.001) of developi[INVESTIGATOR_4246] (+0.40 
kg/m2; p=.009) over the [ADDRESS_3970] pre -treatment data, we found that 
hyperphagia (β=0.348, p=.004) , but not the other depressive symptoms , is associated with 
greater insulin resistance. The cohort for this analysis was the [ADDRESS_3971]-treatment visits due minus those with baseline diabetes (final n=78, 63% with hyperphagia 
and/or hypersomnia). T he outcome was the Homeostatic Model of Assessment 2 (HOMA2) 
Score67 computed from fasting glucose and insulin from banked plasma samples. Together, our 
results raise the intriguing possibly that depressed adults with hyperphagia and/or hypersomnia 
may show greater improvement in diabetes risk markers after depr ession treatment due to their 
higher baseline diabetes risk . We will explore this possibility in the proposed RCT.  
 
2.0 Objectives  
 
Diabetes and prediabetes are top public health priorities in the U.S. Diabetes affects 31 
million (12%) adults, and another 82 million (34%) adults have prediabetes, a precursor to frank 
diabetes.1,[ADDRESS_3972] and include cardiovascular disease (CVD), 
renal disease, amputations, blindness, neuropathy, reduced functional status, and death.1,3,[ADDRESS_3973] 
only partial effectiveness.5,54-56 This has created a clear need for new primary prevention targets 
and approaches, especially for type 2 diabetes (T2D; 90 -95% of diabetes cases in U.S. adults1). 
Thus, our focus is on augmenting the overall effectiveness of diabetes prevention efforts by 
[CONTACT_4297] n targets that are unaddressed in current 
approaches . 
Depression, another top priority, is a diabetes risk factor. A [ADDRESS_3974] 56% (unadjusted) and 38% (adjusted for established diabetes risk 
factors) greater risk of diabetes than nondepressed adults. T he risk conferred by [CONTACT_4298],15-[ADDRESS_3975] also been identified.27 Collectively, these literatures form the scientific premise for the 
proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4247] -to-diabetes relationship is independent 
of established di abetes risk factors, is clinically important (i.e., of sufficient magnitude that 
effective intervention could meaningfully lower diabetes risk), is robust, and is biobehaviorally 
plausible. However, research has yet to determine whether depression treatmen t can prevent 
the development of T2D in people with prediabetes.  
Depression is receiving increased, but still limited, attention in settings where diabetes 
prevention occurs, such as primary care. Thus, there is a large cohort of primary care patients 
with an underdetected or undertreated diabetes risk factor (depression). This status quo could 
represent a major missed opportunity to prevent diabetes. Together, the state of the depression - eIMPACT

IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/[ADDRESS_3978]’s 
objective is to perform a preliminary evaluation  of the efficacy of our existing primary care -based 
intervention for depression (eIMPACT -DM) in improving diabetes risk markers. eIMPACT -DM is 
a modernized collaborative stepped care interve ntion consisting of (1) computerized and 
telephonic cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and (2) select antidepressant 
medications included in an algorithm optimized for diabetes risk reduction.  Our preliminary data 
(see C2 ) establish the feasibility and antidepressive efficacy of eIMPACT -DM. We propose a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4248] [ADDRESS_3979] -DM or the active control (depression ed ucation, 
symptom monitoring, and primary care for depression). The primary outcome is hemoglobin A1c 
– the gold standard glycemic outcome,68 a strong predictor of diabetes development,69,70 and a 
potent indicator of improvement in diabetes endpoints.5,69,71,72 
 
Primary Aim : Determine the preliminary efficacy of eIMPACT -DM in improving diabetes 
risk markers among  depressed primary care patients with prediabetes. Depressed patients 
randomized to eIMPACT -DM, versus the active control, will exhibit greater improvemen t in A1c 
(primary outcome; H1) and insulin resistance (HOMA score; secondary outcome; H2) from pre -
treatment to post -treatment 6 months later.  
 
Exploratory Aim : Explore whether the effect of eIMPACT -DM on diabetes risk markers is 
greater among patients wi th a somatic presentation of depression at pre -treatment 
(baseline) than among patients without such a presentation.  A somatic presentation of 
depression at baseline is defined as having hyperphagia (increased appetite/weight) and/or 
hypersomnia (increased sleep) at pre -treatment.  Our preliminary data (see C3) suggest that, in 
people with depression, those with hyperphagia (increased appetite/weight) and/or hypersomnia 
(increased sleep) are a subgroup at particularly elevated diabetes risk. Becaus e our findings 
raise the intriguing possibly that this subgroup may show greater improvement in diabetes risk 
markers after depression treatment, we will explore if effect sizes for eIMPACT -DM on A1c and 
insulin resistance are larger for patients with vers us without hyperphagia and/or hypersomnia.  
 
There is a tight fit between our aims and PA -18-405, which requests applications for pi[INVESTIGATOR_4249] “lay the foundation for larger clinical trials related to the prevention 
and/or treatment of  diabetes” by “acquiring data to support the rationale and/or feasibility of a 
definitive study and to develop and/or refine power calculations.” These trials could “test a new 
disease prevention strategy” and/or “explore the differential responses to inte rventions amongst 
subpopulations.” A positive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4242] R01 -level RCT by: (1) generating 
critical proof -of-concept data  (eIMPACT -DM can improve A1c) to support the premise of the 
definitive trial; (2) providing preliminary effect  sizes  for eIMPACT -DM on diabetes risk markers 
to help justify future power analyses; (3) identifying a potentially important moderator  of 
eIMPACT -DM efficacy that may need to be incorporated into the definitive trial. Ultimately, 
demonstrating that depres sion treatment reduces diabetes risk would have a substantial 
positive impact. It would identify a novel target (depression) for diabetes prevention efforts, and 
it would equip healthcare providers with a new practical, scalable, and disseminable intervent ion 
(eIMPACT -DM) to help lower diabetes risk for a large cohort of high -risk patients.

 3.0 Outcome Measures /Endpoints  
 
Primary Outcome  (A1c)  
The primary outcome is [ADDRESS_3980] assessment of 
glycemic control and is a common surrogate endpoint in diabetes trials.16 Also, A1c ≥6.5% is 
diagnostic of diabetes.86 Second, A1c strongly predicts future d iabetes.17 A systematic review18 
found that the 5 -year incidence of diabetes increased sharply with A1c, from <9% incidence for 
A1c 5.0 -5.5% to 9 -25% incidence for A1c 5.5 -6.0% and 25 -50% incidence for A1c 6.0 -6.5%. 
The diabetes incidence rate for A1c 5.0 -5.5%, 5.5 -6.0%, and 6.0 -6.5% was approximately 2 
times, 5 times, and 20 times greater than for A1c <5.0%, respectively.[ADDRESS_3981] been shown to also improve clinical diabetes endpoints,19,20 
and diabetes prevent ion interventions targeting glycemic control result in reduced rates of 
progression from prediabetes to T2D.8,17 Thus, A1c is associated with clinical benefit. Fourth, 
A1c has statistical advantages. As a continuous measure, it provides greater statistical  power 
than clinical events and thus requires smaller samples and shorter follow -ups. Also, because 
A1c reflects average glucose over the preceding 90 -120 days,139 it is more stable than 
alternative measures, such as fasting glucose and oral glucose tolera nce tests.86 For all of these 
reasons, A1c is well suited to evaluate if a new intervention approach holds promise, and it is 
appropriate and feasible for pi[INVESTIGATOR_4250].  
 
Secondary Outcome  (HOMA Score)  
The secondary outcome is 6 -month change in insulin resi stance, as indicated by [CONTACT_4299]. HOMA scores80 will be derived from fasting glucose (glucose oxidase method on a 
Randox Daytona Clinical Analyzer) and insulin (two antibody immunoassay on a [COMPANY_002] cobas 
e411 Analyzer). Fasting glucose and insulin assays will be performed in Translation Core 
Analyte Lab of the Indiana CTSI. HOMA score is an established index of insulin resistance that 
correlates highly with the more invasive euglycemic clamp (r=0.85 -0.88) and is appropriate for 
assessing change.111-114 
 
Exploratory Outcome  (Incident Diabetes)  
 The exploratory outcome is time to T2D onset, defined as the first occurrence of the 
following between the participant's enrollment date  and five years after their post -treatment visit 
date: T2D diagnosis (ICD -10 E1 1), fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, A1c ≥6.5%, or death due to 
T2D. The Regenstrief programmer will identify incident T2D cases by [CONTACT_4300] – the 
statewide health information exchange (see B3) – blinded to group assignment. Our 
endocrinologist ([CONTACT_4334] ), also blinded, will use standardized criteria to adjudicate all incident 
T2D cases. As we are doing in the eIMPACT Trial, we will obtain authorization from participants 
to conduct INPC searches to identify incident diabetes until five years after their p ost-treatment 
visit date . We will assess this outcome annually, with the first assessment at post -treatment. 
Because only a large Phase III trial would be powered for clinical events, incident T2D is an 
exploratory outcome. Based on  our prediabetes inclusi on criterion  and the review described 
above,[ADDRESS_3982] a diabetes incidence rate of ≥25% over [ADDRESS_3983]. Stewart will use his 
faculty development funds ($4K/year) and/or his research account ($50K) to cover INPC 
searches after the project period.  
 
Somatic Depressive Symptoms  
Total depressive sympt oms will be assessed by [CONTACT_941] 20 depression items (response 
options: 0 -4) of the Symptom Checklist -90 (SCL -20), a reliable and valid scale,115-118 at the pre - 
IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/[ADDRESS_3984] -treatment visit. Patients with a score ≥2 to the hyperphagia item and/or hypersomnia 
item at pre -treatment will be coded as “yes” for the presence of somatic depressive symptoms. 
All others will be coded as “no.”  
 
Other Factors  
Weight, height, blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and temperature will be 
measured by [CONTACT_4301] (pre, post). Validated questions/scales will assess demographics, 
medical/psychiatric history, current medications, alcohol  use (AUDIT ),73 tobacco use (BRFSS 
Tobacco Use Questionnaire),119,120 physical activity (International Physical Activity 
Questionnaire),121 OHA adherence (Morisky Medication Adherence Scale -8),122-124 depressive 
symptoms (PHQ -9),74,75 anxiety (GAD -7),125 hostility/anger (Buss -Perry Aggression 
Questionnaire),[ADDRESS_3985] (Positive Affect subscale of the PANAS),77,78 life satisfaction 
(Satisfaction with Life Scale ),79 insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index) ,80 sleep quality 
(PSQI) ,126 eating behavior s (Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire) ,81quality of life (SF -20)82 (all 
pre, post) , and expectancy of benefit83 (pre). Attention will be determined from the intervention 
database for eIMPACT -DM patients and from EMR chart review for AC patients (post). 
Depression care variables (e.g., antidepressant dose/duration and ps ychotherapy session 
number/type) will be determined from the treatment delivery database for eIMPACT -DM patients 
and from EMR chart review for Active Control patients (post). Patients will complete a brief 
interview to assess depression care received outsi de of the trial (post). We will assess 
depression treatment acceptability  (post). Diabetes prevention care received outside the trial will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_4302] (post) and a brief interview (post).  We will also assess for the 
occurrence of any po tential adverse events using a brief questionnaire and will administered the 
Techniques for Overcoming Depression Questionnaire84 (post).

• Current primary care patient in Eskenazi Health: a clinic visit in the past two years at one 
or more of the 8 Eskenazi primary care clinics (Clinics: Blackburn, Cottage Corner, 
Forest Manor, Grassy Creek, North Arlington, OCC, Westside, W. 38th St, Center for 
Senior Health)  
• Age ≥18 years  
• Current depressive disorder: During screening, ResNet assistants will administer the 
Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9),[ADDRESS_3987] a depressive 
disorder if (a) they have a PHQ -9 ≥1081 and (b) they meet criteria for a PHQ -9 MDD 
diagnosis ( [ADDRESS_3988] 2 weeks) .83 The PHQ -9 cut point of ≥10 has 88% 
sensitivity and 88% specificity for MDD diagnosed by a clinical interview.81  The 
combination of a PHQ -9 ≥10 and a PHQ -9 MDD diagnosis helps to ensure that false 
positives will not be enrolled. In addition to its diagnostic validity, we chose a PHQ -9 
case finding approach because: (a) it is feasible in primary care and is how depressed 
patients will lik ely be identified in clinical practice, (b) recent successful trials have used 
similar approaches,106,132,133 and (c) we observed initial evidence of a signal of 
depression treatment on fasting glucose levels in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], in which we used PHQ -9 
≥10 as the depress ion inclusion criterion (see C 1). 
• Prediabetes: (a) a prediabetes diagnosis (ICD -10 code R73.03) ever in the patient’s 
EMR before enrollment  or the most recent A1c in the past 2 years between 5.70 -6.49%  
in the patient’s EMR before enrollment  and (b)  a finger -stick A1c  <6.5%86 at the start of 
the pre -treatment visit  
 
Exclusion C riteria  
• History of diabetes: a self -reported type 1 or 2 diabetes diagnosis during screening or 
any of the following in the patient’s EMR before enrollment: type 1 or 2 diabetes 
diagnosis (ICD -9 250.X; ICD -10 E10.X or E11.X), fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, A1c 
≥6.5%, or insulin prescription. Patients with a pre -treatment A1c ≥6.5% will also be 
coded as having a history of diabetes, and their PCP will be notified. Of note, OHA use 
is not exclusionary, as practice guidelines recommend OHAs for prediabetes in some 
situations.86 
• HIV/AIDS  
• Chronic kidney disease  
• Active cancer/current cancer treatment  
• Ongoing treatment for an inflammatory condition (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, 
Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) in the past 3 months  (daily use of NSAIDS is 
allowed)  
• Current pregnancy: Women able to become pregnant will complete a urine pregnancy 
test at the pre -treatment visit, and those w ith a positive pregnancy test will not continue 
in the trial.  
• Severe cognitive impairment: ≥3 errors on a validated 6 -item cognitive screen87 during 
screening  
• Acute risk of suicide: Patients will be coded as at acute risk of suicide if: (a) they trigger 
the Suicidal Ideation Protection Protocol (see 16.0 Appendix ) during screening or at the 
start of the pre -treatment visit and (b) after the situation is properly handled, the patient’s 
PCP or other clinical provider considers the patient to be at acute risk of suicide.

Version Date: 05/19/2021   Page 12 of 34 
 • History of bipolar disorder or psychosis  or current use of an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_4252] : a self -reported diagnosis of bipolar disorder or a psychotic disorder during 
screening or a bipolar disorder diagnosis [ICD-9 code 296.X (all); ICD -10 codes F30X 
(all), F31X (all), F34.0] in the patient’s EMR before enrollment or a psychotic disorder 
diagnosis [ICD-9 code 295.X (all); ICD -10 codes F20.X (all), F21, F22, F23, F24, F25.X 
(all), F29] in the patient’s EMR before enrollment or current use  of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4254], asenapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], asenapi[INVESTIGATOR_4255], brexiprazole, cariprazine,

palmitate, pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256], quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone, or ziprasidone  in the patient’s EMR at 
screening.  
• Participation in the eIMPACT Trial: All patients who participated in the eIMPACT Trial 
will be removed from the recruitment lists of eligible patients. Thus, none will be 
contact[CONTACT_4304].  
 
Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
None of the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4257], gender, 
race, or ethnicity, except that pregnant women will be excluded due to the potential influence of 
pregnancy on depression and diabetes risk mark ers. We conducted a preliminary EMR search 
and identified 47,361 demographically and medically eligible Eskenazi primary care patients 
with no history of diabetes (63% women, 48% non -Hispanic Black, 20% Hispanic/Latino), of 
whom 9,876 (21%) fell on the hig h priority list (positive for a prediabetes marker). Moreover, in 
our eIMPACT Trial involving older Eskenazi primary care patients, we have had success 
recruiting and retaining racial/ethnic minorities with a depressive disorder, as 49% of the 216 
randomiz ed patients identify as non -Hispanic Black, 4.6% as Hispanic/Latino, and 3.2% as 
multiracial. Because <3% of Indianapolis residents are American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, 
or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (see www.stats.indiana.edu ), we do not expect these 
racial groups to be well -represented in the proposed trial. Based on these data, we anticipate 
that participants in the proposed trial will be 64 primary care patien ts aged ≥18 years with a 
depressive disorder and prediabetes, of whom 60% will be women, ≥40% will be non -Hispanic 
Black, ≥10% will be Hispanic/Latino . We expect that, due to randomization, groups based on 
sex, gender, race, and ethnicity will be approxima tely equally represented in the two trial arms. 
It is worth noting that the inclusion of a high percentage of women and racial/ethnic minorities 
will enhance the external validity of the findings of the proposed trial.  
 
Inclusion of Children  
Participants i n the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4258] 64 primary care patients aged ≥18 years 
with a depressive disorder and prediabetes. Children (<18 years) will not be eligible because a 
separate, age -specific study of children is warranted and preferable for at least two r easons. 
One, evidence indicates that depression is experienced and expressed differently in children 
and adolescents (e.g., with increased irritability and suicidal ideation) versus in adults. Two, the 
major components of our modernized collaborative stepp ed care intervention for depression 
called eIMPACT -DM – namely,  Good Days Ahead  (computerized cognitive -behavioral therapy), 
Problem -Solving Treatment in Primary Care (telephonic cognitive -behavioral therapy), and our 
antidepressant algorithm optimized for  diabetes risk reduction – were designed for adults and 
have not been fully evaluated in children. Thus, the appropriateness, acceptability, and 
effectiveness of eIMPACT -DM in children are unknown.  
 
5.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 
Participants will be 64 primary care patients (≥18 years, 50% minority) with a depressive 
disorder and prediabetes but no history of diabetes.  
IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/[ADDRESS_3989] Trial  (see C2 ), we met our recruitment goal of randomizing 216 
Eskenazi primary care patients with a current depressive disorder and CVD risk factors (78% 
women, 56% non -White) but no history of clinical CVD. First, a Regenstrief Institute data 
manager will search the Eskenazi EMR in accordance with HIPAA and IRB regulations to 
generate lists of potentially eligible patients. To optimize recruitment, we will have high and low 
priority lists. Patients will be placed on the high priority list and screened first if there is a 
prediabetes marker ( A1c 5.70 -6.49%  or prediabetes ICD -10 code R73.03 ) present in their EMR 
in the last [ADDRESS_3990] Trial are not enrolled, we will remove all 
such patients from these recruitment lists prior to screening. Second, ResNet personnel will 
obtain permission to approach for screening from each patient's PCP. ResNet, Indiana 
University’s prima ry care practice -based research network, is the sole mechanism through 
which primary care patients can be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  Third, ResNet personnel will conduct high -
intensity phone screening. Through administering the eligibility interview refined in the eIMPACT  
Trial, they will assess depression status, medical/psychiatric status, and cognitive function . For 
patients who are eligible and remain interested in participating, ResNet personnel will provide a 
brief summary of key  information  from the informed consent  statement at the end of the call.  
Specifically, they will summarize: the voluntary nature of participation, the study rationale, the 
structure and duration of study visits/contacts, the potential risks and benefits of participation, 
and payment for partic ipation.  Written informed consent and authorization will be obtain ed from 
each participant at the start of the pre -treatment visit.  
Using the 4.8% randomization rate from our eIMPACT Trial, we estimate that we will 
need to screen ≈26/week to randomize [ADDRESS_3991] Trial, which has similar but more restrictive eligibility criteria, 4.8% (216/4539) of 
approached patients were randomized. Most ineligible patients did not meet the current 
depressive disorder inc lusion criterion. We conducted an EMR search and identified 47,361 
demographically and medically eligible Eskenazi primary care patients with no history of 
diabetes (63% women, 48% non -Hispanic Black, 20% Hispanic/Latinx), of whom 9,876 (21%) 
fell on the h igh priority list (positive for a prediabetes marker). ResNet leadership agrees that 
our approach and our randomization rate and target are feasible. We will be able to start 
recruitment immediately because personnel and protocols are in place from the eIM PACT Trial.  
 
Randomization  
1:1 randomization88 will be stratified by A1c ( ≤6.09%, 6.10 -6.49%)  and somatic 
depressive symptoms (yes, no) at pre -treatment using random number sequences.88 
Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes containing group assignment will be 
prepared by [CONTACT_4305] ([CONTACT_4335]).  
 
Blinding  
All outcomes assessors will be blinded to group assignment to ensure unbiased results. 
The investigators and interventionists will have no data collection responsibilities, and the 
patients will be explicitly instructed not to reveal their group assignment  to the outcomes 
assessors.  
 
Retention Plan  
We will use the successful practices of our eIMPACT Trial to retain participants over the 
6-month study period. First, we will implement Mason's procedures for minimizing attrition – 
e.g., collecting extensive co ntact information for patients and at least two secondary contacts, 
stressing the study timeline and scientific importance of study completion at enrollment, and 
IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/2021   Page 14 of 34 
 providing consistent incentives ($75 for attending the pre -treatment visit and $[ADDRESS_3992] -treatment visit). Second, we will make reminder calls and/or send reminder texts before 
the pre - and post -treatment visits according to patient preference (e.g., one day before, one 
week before, or both). Third, for all study visits, we will co ver parking or transportation 
expenses, including arranging taxis  or ride shares (e.g., Uber and Lyft) and providing bus 
vouchers. Fourth, we will maintain at least monthly contact [CONTACT_4306]. Fifth, we will mail a mid -treatment newsletter to participants in both 
arms with study updates. The low attrition observed in the eIMPACT Trial indicates that our 
retention practices are effective, as 93% of participants in the intervention arm and 91% of 
participan ts in the usual care arm have attended the [ADDRESS_3993] -DM (our modernized 
collaborative stepped care intervention for depression) or the active control (depression 
education, symptom monitoring, and primary care for depression). The primary outcome is 
hemoglobin A1c – the gold standard glycemic outcome,68 a strong predictor of diabetes 
development,69,70 and a potent indicator of improvement in diabetes endp oints.5,69,71,72 The 
secondary outcome is HOMA score, an established index of insulin resistance that correlates 
highly with the more invasive euglycemic clamp (r=0.85 -0.88)  and is appropriate for assessing 
change.85-[ADDRESS_3994] -DM on diabetes risk markers (A1c and HOMA score).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In line with current conceptual frameworks,[ADDRESS_3995] -DM will improve 
A1c and insulin resistance by [CONTACT_4307] (see 
figure). These downstream factors (grey boxes) are the leading candidate mechanisms by 
[CONTACT_4308]. First, substantial literatures indicate that 
depression is associated with each downstream factor (see A3). Second, intervention studies 
indicate that depression treatment (CBT or antidepressants) is related to improvements in 
autonomic dys function,89-[ADDRESS_3996] hoc analysis suggests that computerized CBT is associated with improvements 
in inflammatory markers and fasting glucose (see C2). While we expect that intervention -related 
reductions in depressive sympt oms (paths a and b) will result in decreases in downstream 
factors (paths c, d, and e), some antidepressants could reduce A1c and insulin resistance via 
their direct effects on inflammation99 and weight loss.100,[ADDRESS_3997] (mechanistic trials are not allowed under PA -18-405); however, we plan to 
do so in the future definitive trial. Blue boxes indicate factors to be assessed in the proposed 
trial.

7.0 Study Procedures  
 
Trial Overview  
Patients will attend the pre -treatment visit at the Clinical Research Center (CRC). They 
will fast and avoid tobacco and exercise for ≥[ADDRESS_3998] an A1c of <6.5%. Those with an A1c  outside o f this range will 
not continue. Women able to become pregnant will also compl ete a urine pregnancy test , and 
those with a positive pregnancy test will not continue in the trial.  Patients will complete 
questionnaires, an interview, anthropometric measurements, vital signs assessments (blood 
pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and temperature), and standard venipuncture  (to test A1c, 
HOMA  scores , and insulin levels) . Finally, randomization will occur. Six months after 
randomization, patients will return to the CRC for the post -treatment visit following the same 
procedures  as the pre -treatment visit .  
 
Trial Setting  
The setting is the [ADDRESS_3999] lower SES (~90% are underinsured/ uninsured) and minority (~50% are 
racial/ethnic minorities) populations.  
 
Participants  
 Please see sections 4.0 and 5.0 above.  
 
Treatment Groups  
1:1 randomization102 will be stratified by A1c ( ≤6.09%, 6.10 -6.49%)  and somatic 
symptoms (yes, no).  
 
eIMPACT -DM is our eIMPACT intervention (see C 2), excep t that G ood Days Ahead  has 
replaced Beating the Blues and the antidepressant algorithm has been optimized for diabetes 
risk reduction. It i s a collaborative care intervention in which a  multidisciplinary team delivers 
established depression treatments consistent with patient preference. It uses a stepped, flexible, 
treat-to-target approach that modernizes the IMPACT intervention50 by [CONTACT_4309]. Interventions are Good Days Ahead  (GDA ), Problem  
Solving Treatment in Primary Care (PST -PC), and antidepressants. Critically, each intervention 
has a strong evidence base supporting its efficacy, and the IMPACT results50 and our data (see 
C2) support e fficacy of the intervention structure. Our treatment team consists of a depression 
clinical specialist (DCS; Ms. MacDonald), a supervising psychia trist with expertise in primary 
care ([CONTACT_4336] ), and  the patients' PCPs. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_4259].

 (1) GDA  (Empower Interactive; video tutorial ) is an empi[INVESTIGATOR_4260], HIP AA 
compliant, computerized CBT for depression appropriate for primary care patients and people 
with little computer experience.[ADDRESS_4000]. Jess e Wright (University of 
Louisville), [CONTACT_4337] (University of Washington), and [CONTACT_4338] (University of 
Pennsylvania). [CONTACT_4339] is widely recognized as the father of CBT. [CONTACT_4340] is also a 
co-founder of Empower Interactive. GDA uses a n interactive, multimedia format (including 
video, exercises, calls to action, newsfeeds, and customized feedback)  to deliver 9 45-minute 
sessions, the structure and content of which mirror face -to-face CBT.  Although session content 
is tailored to each pat ient, general topi[INVESTIGATOR_4261], 
using behavioral activation and other behavioral methods, identifying and modifying schemas, 
using effective copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], and employing other core CBT methods. Characters 
appe aring in GDA represent diverse racial, ethnic, age, and cultural backgrounds. GDA includes 
a clinician portal to allow clinicians to track progress, view completed exercises, and check 
comprehension.  GDA is empi[INVESTIGATOR_4260] – it is acceptable to patients,[ADDRESS_4001] comparators (effect size = 1.60),105 and yields equiv alent 
(noninferior) depression outcomes to standard face -to-face CBT (effect size = 0.05).105,106 GDA 
is being evaluated further in ongoing trials in new settings.103 
To minimize time/transportation barriers, GDA sessions will occur at the PI’s lab or a 
location with internet access selected by [CONTACT_102] ( e.g., patient’s, family member’s, or friend’s 
home). In our eIMPACT Trial, most patients have elected to complete BtB remotely. For those 
with lower confidence in using GDA , the DCS and patient will work through the first few 
sessions together  over the phone, via IU Zoom Health , or in the PI’s lab . IU Zoom Health is a 
HIPAA -aligned version of Zoom for use by [CONTACT_4310] (PHI) is shared or discussed.  It is currently in use at many medical cent ers. 
Patients can install it for free onto their smartphones, tablets, or computers.  
(2) PST-PC is an established, manualized, empi[INVESTIGATOR_4263].107-[ADDRESS_4002] -PC by [CONTACT_4311] , which we (see C2) and others113 have found to be feasible and efficacious.   
(3) Antidepressants . We first considered al l FDA -approved antidepressants and 
excluded those with weight gain effects (tricyclics, paroxetine, mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]73,74) and those rarely 
used in primary care (MAOIs114). Then, we used existing evidence to inform the structure. We 
made bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (an aminoketone) and fluoxetine (an SSRI) our first -line and second -line 
antidepressants, as meta -analyses indicate that their use is associated with weight loss.100,101 
We made other SSRIs (escitalopram, sertraline) and SNRIs (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, 
venlafaxine) our third -line antidepressants, given their negligible effects on weight.100,[ADDRESS_4003] trials, our team will make recommendations to the patient’s 
PCP, who will write prescriptions. Our team and the PCP will then collaboratively manage 
pharmacotherapy.  
IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/[ADDRESS_4004] - and second -line psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; 
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_4264] - and second -line 
antidepressants (others are third -line). For patients on 
an antidepressant at entry, the dosage may  be increased, psychot herapy may be added, or a 
different antidepressant may be prescribed. For patients who want psychotherapy but have 
major barriers to GDA , PST -PC will be offered at Step 1. Our DCS will follow patients for [ADDRESS_4005] every 2 weeks. For patients who achieve 
remission (≥50% PHQ -9 reduction and <3 symptoms50), the DCS will develop a relapse 
prevention plan and follow -up monthly. Step 2  – augmenting Step 1 with psychotherapy or an 
antidepressant or switching to another psychotherapy or antidepressant – will be delivered to 
patients not in remission. If remission is not achieved after Step 2, Step 3  will be initiated , which 
will involve additional psychotherapy  and/or antidepressants.  
Active Control (AC)  consists of depression 
education (study staff), symptom monitoring (study 
staff), and primary care for depression (clinical staff). 
(1) At the end of the pre -treatment visit, the RA 
responsible for Active Control delivery (a clinical 
psychology PhD mentee of the PI) will speak  to the 
patient for 20 minutes via IU Zoom Health  to review 
depression materials,115 including their PCP's role in 
its m anagement and treatment options. In addition, 
patients will be provided with a list of Eskenazi 
mental health services , and the RA will encourage patients to follow -up with their PCP . To 
engender expectancy of benefit, the RA will stress that our notifications should prompt PCP 
actions and that the available treatments are effective. We will then send an EMR message to 
the PCP indicating that their patient has a depressive disorder and was randomized to the AC 
group. This message will encourage the PCP to address their patient’s depression, note that 
there are no care restrictions, and provide the same list of Eskenazi services.  (2) The RA will 
call AC patients every 4 weeks (i.e., at the end of Months 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) to assess depressive 
symptoms (PHQ -9) and will notify clinical staff to encourage additional care when indicated (see 
table). (3) AC patients will receive curren t primary care for depression. The Eskenazi primary 
care clinics utilize a team care approach for behavioral health issues, as PCPs are supported by 
[CONTACT_4312].  
We chose an AC comparator116 for several reasons. (1) Because we plan to use an AC 
group in the R01 -level RCT, we need to use it here to obtain accurate effect size estimates. 
Other approaches (no comparator or usual care comparator) could overestimate effect sizes. (2) 
Our AC group will help to ensure that the groups have similar expectancy of benefit and clinical eIMPACT -DM Treatment Process

Version Date: 05/19/[ADDRESS_4006] for them in a sensitivity 
analysis. (3) Our AC group is feasible. As eIMPACT -DM uses a flexible appro ach, each patient 
will have their own treatment path within the intervention structure. Thus, it is not possible to 
develop a comparator that exactly parallels the attention for each eIMPACT -DM patient.  
 
Type  Name  [CONTACT_4333] (e.g., 
Psychother apy, 
Lifestyle 
Counseling)  eIMPACT -DM 
(intervention)  eIMPACT -DM is a 6 -month, modernized, collaborative, stepped 
care intervention consisting of (1) computerized and telephonic 
cognitive -behavioral therapy for depression and (2) select 
antidepressant medic ations included in an algorithm optimized 
for diabetes risk reduction.  It is a collaborative care intervention 
in which a  multidisciplinary team delivers established 
depression treatments consistent with patient preference. It 
uses a stepped, flexible, treat -to-target approach that 
modernizes the IMPACT intervention by [CONTACT_4313]. Interventions are  
Good Days Ahead , Problem Solving Treatment in Primary Care, 
and select FDA -approved antidepressants. The treatment team 
consists of a depression clinical specialist, a supervising MD 
with expertise in primary care and IMPACT, and the patients' 
PCPs.  
Behavioral (e.g., 
Psychotherapy, 
Lifestyle 
Counseling)  Active Control 
(comparator)  Active Control (AC) consists of depression education (study 
staff), symptom monitoring (study staff), and primary care for 
depression (clinical staff). (1) The RA (a clinical psychology PhD 
mentee of the PI) will have a 50 -minute call with AC patients to 
review depression materials, including their PCP's role and 
treatment options. We will send an EMR message to the 
patient’s PCP to encourage the PCP to address their patient’s 
depression. (2) The RA will call AC patients every 4 weeks to 
assess depressive symptoms and will notify clinical staff to 
encourage additional care when indicated. (3) AC patients will 
receive current primary care for depres sion. The Eskenazi 
primary care clinics utilize a team care approach for behavioral 
health issues, as PCPs are supported by [CONTACT_4314].  
 
Potential for Crossover Effects : Because randomization will occur at the patient level, 
it is possible that a PCP could have patients in both the eIMPACT and Active Control groups. 
Even so, crossover effects (i.e., diffusion of treatment) are unlikely for s everal reasons. One, 
PCPs do not attend eIMPACT treatment team meetings and do not have access to the 
eIMPACT treatment protocol, including the antidepressant algorithm. Instead, if treatment with 
an antidepressant is pursued for a particular patient, the PCP will receive a specific medication 
recommendation from the eIMPACT -DM treatment team via the DCS. Two, the behavioral 
health clinicians embedded in the targeted primary care clinics do not have the capacity or 
resources to deliver the intensity or mode s (computerized) of psychotherapy of the eIMPACT 
treatment team. Three, we have not observed any evidence of crossover effects in our ongoing 
eIMPACT Trial, which utilizes a similar design. Moreover, our preliminary data from that trial 
(see C2) – i.e., 51 % of eIMPACT patients, versus 20% of usual care patients, had a 50% 
reduction in depressive symptoms – argue against the existence of meaningful crossover 
effects. For these reasons, we believe that crossover effects (i.e., diffusion of treatment) are not 
a threat to the internal validity of the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265].

 Justification for Intervention and Comparator Components : We chose to 
incorporate only components addressing depression specifically into our intervention and active 
control groups. We chose not  to incorporate components directly targeting factors known to 
improve A1c (e.g., diet, physical activity, or weight) into our intervention or active control groups, 
as doing so would severely cloud interpretation and undermine our ability to determine whe ther 
improving depression lowers A1c and other diabetes risk markers – the primary aim of the 
proposed research.  
 
Training and Treatment Fidelity : Before launch, the treatment team will complete 
training with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_4266] -DM model and antidepress ant algorithm. The DCS will also 
complete trainings for  GDA with Empower Interactive  and PST -PC with the AIMS Center. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_4267]. At bi -monthly treatment team meetings, fidelity to 
eIMPACT -DM will be assessed by [CONTACT_978]. In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_4268] a random subset of 
20% of eIMPACT -DM and Active Control patients every [ADDRESS_4007] Trial, which we will use here. This database, which will 
include the DCS’s de -identified notes and EMR messages, will allow for assessments of 
treatment fidelity. To maintain high fidelity, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_4269]. Our approaches are in line with the NIH Treatment Fidelity Workgroup 
recommendations.138

8.0 Study Calendar  
 
The timeline for study activities is shown below. In Quarter 1 of Year 1, we will complete 
trial start -up tasks, including obtaining regulatory approvals from the Indiana University IRB, the 
Indiana CTSI Clinical Research Center, and Eskenazi Health Researc h Committee; forming the 
DSMB and obtaining the board's feedback on the trial protocol; finalizing all trial manuals, 
protocols, questionnaire batteries, databases, and meetings; and registering this study on 
ClinicalTrials.gov. Of note, through the eIMPAC T Trial, we have already developed many 
materials (treatment manuals, safety protocols, questionnaire batteries, and REDCap 
databases), processes (treatment team meeting structure and preferred methods of 
communicating with PCPs), and relationships (Eskena zi leadership, PCPs, and clinic staff). We 
have also obtained permission from the IMPACT PI (Dr. Unützer) to modify the IMPACT 
intervention and manuals. During the 1 -year recruitment period (Quarter 2 in Year 1 through 
Quarter 1 in Year 2), we will recruit  and randomize (at the end of the pre -treatment visit) 64 
primary care patients with a depressive disorder and prediabetes. During the 1.5 -year treatment 
period (Quarter 2 in Year 1 through Quarter 3 in Year 2), the eIMPACT -DM and Active Control 
interventi ons will be delivered. The post -treatment visits will begin [ADDRESS_4008] for which this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4270].

Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
 
Adverse Event Monitoring   
As we are doing in our ongoing eIMPACT Trial (see C2), we will systematically identify 
potential adverse events (AEs): (a) by [CONTACT_4315] 6 
months (before DSMB meetings) for all emergency department visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and 
deaths that occurred among randomized patients a nd (b)  by [CONTACT_4316] a self -
report questionnaire assessing for the occurrence of any potential adverse events  since the pre -
treatment visit administered at the post -treatment visit. The eIMPACT -DM depression clinical 
specialist will also receive alerts through the Eskenazi Health EMR when any randomized 
patient has a new emergency department visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], which will provide real -time 
monitoring.  Finally, any potential adverse events spo ntaneously reported by [CONTACT_4317] (e.g., 
during a study visit or call) will be evaluated. We will fully investigate, rate, and prepare a Case 
Report Form for those events that are plausibly related to depression, depression treatment, 
suicidal ideation, or any study procedures and for all deaths. For all other captured events 
(emergency department  visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4271]), we will provide frequency counts for the eIMPACT -DM and 
Active Control arms. We will fully investigate these events only if there is evidence of group 
imbalance. It is worth noting that that: (a) we are delivering safe and established depression 
interventions, (b) we are not delivering any new or experime ntal interventions or restricting usual 
care, and (c) all study procedures are noninvasive (except for the blood draw) and standard.  
 
Adverse Event Rating and Reporting  
All events plausibly related to depression, depression treatment, suicidal ideation, or  any 
study procedures and all deaths will be promptly rated using the anticipation, severity, and 
attribution scales below.  These ratings will be included in the Case Report Form for the adverse 
event signed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stewart (principal investigator) and [CONTACT_4336]  (trial p sychiatrist ). 
 
Anticipation  
1. Anticipated  
2. Unanticipated  
 
Severity  
1. Mild: Awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated  
2. Moderate: Interference with normal daily activities  
3. Severe: Inability to perform normal daily activities  
4. Life -Threatening: Immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred  
 
Attribution  
1. Definite: Adverse event clearly related to study involvement  
2. Probable: Adverse event likely related to  study involvement  
3. Possible: Adverse event may be related to study involvement  
4. Unlikely: Adverse event doubtfully related to study involvement  
5. Unrelated: Adverse event clearly not related to study involvement

 All AEs that meet the IUPUI IRB promp t reporting requirements (unanticipated; 
definitely, probably, or possibly related to study involvement; and suggest that the research 
places participants or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized) 
will be immediately repo rted the IUPUI IRB, DSMB, CRC Research Subject Advocate, and NIH. 
All severe or life -threatening AEs will be immediately reported to and reviewed by [CONTACT_4318]. All 
other AEs will be reported to these entities at the time of continuing review. A summary of A E 
data (e.g., frequency, types, and corrective actions) will be provided to the IUPUI IRB, DSMB, 
CRC Research Subject Advocate, and NIH at the time of continuing review.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
As we did in our ongoing eIMPACT Trial (see C 2), we will form a DSMB to provide 
independent oversight. None of the DSMB members will be involved in the proposed trial other 
than serving on this board. The DSMB will consist of a psychiatrist, an endocrinologist, and a 
clinical trialist from the Indiana University  School  of Medicine . All AEs that are severe/life -
threatening or that raise questions about the risks posed to other participants will be 
immediately reviewed by [CONTACT_4318]. In addition, every [ADDRESS_4010]. Stewart (principal 
investigator) will submit a written report to the DSMB describing study updates; participant 
recruitment, accrual, randomization, and retention; treatment delivery and fidelity; data collection 
and quality; suicidal ideation protection protocol triggers; any adverse eve nts; any protocol 
deviations; and any IRB amendments. At that time, the DSMB will have a closed meeting to 
determine whether the trial should continue unchanged, be modified, or be stopped, and the 
DSMB Chair will provide a written response with all recomm endations. The IUPUI IRB, CRC 
Research Subject Advocate, and NIH will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_4272].  
 
10.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
All participants will be considered enrolled at the start of the pre -treatment visit after 
written informed consent and authorization are obtained . The informed consent statement 
describes the possibility of and the procedures for withdrawing from the study. A participant may 
notify either the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_4273], 
phone, or in -person that s/he wants to withdraw from the study for any reason.  If a participant 
withdraws before the pre -treatment assessment visit, no payment will be provided.  
 
Other reasons for study withdrawal/discontinuation are : (a) the participant’s primary care 
provider or another provider seeing the participant (e.g., a psychiatrist outside of the study 
team) no longer believes that the patient is appropriate for this trial after a triggeri ng of the 
Suicidal Ideation Protection Protocol or any other reason, (b) the participant develops acute or 
serious illness that precludes completion of the main study visits within the allowed timeframes, 
and (c) the participant exhibits evidence of a psyc hotic disorder or bipolar disorder (both of 
which are exclusionary conditions and could interfere with treatment delivery/effectiveness) 
during the 6 month treatment phase of the trial. In the case of situation (b), the patient will not 
complete any future  study visits or calls. However, if the patient provides permission, electronic 
medical record data (e.g., incident  diabetes ) will still be obtained going forward, consistent with 
our Authorization Form. In the case of situation (c), patients with a psycho tic disorder or bipolar 
disorder would likely benefit from psychotropic medications, such as antipsychotic medications 
or mood stabilizer, that are beyond what are provided in this trial.  
  
IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/[ADDRESS_4011] statistically significant differences.  We chose 
N=64, as it is sufficient to yield the expected outcomes and is feasible within the R21 
constraints.  Assuming an attrition rate of ≤20%,[ADDRESS_4012] ≥ 50 completers (25/arm). With 
50 completers and type I error rate=5%, we will have 55%, 68%, 79%, and 88% power to detect 
a d=0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90, respectively. We observed a d=0.90 for CBT for depression on 
fasting glucose in depressed primary care patients (see C2).  
 
Primary Aim Analytic Plan  
 Analyses will use the i ntent -to-treat approach.118 Tests will be two -tailed with p<.05 
considered statistically significant. Supplemental analyses of completers and analyses 
employing multiple imputation (SAS mi and mianalyze) will be performed.  We will assess for 
group differences in  baseline factors.  Due to randomization, we do not expect differences. Even 
so, baseline differences will be taken into account when interpreting results, and baseline 
factors that differ between groups will be added as covariates in sensitivity analyses. We will 
also add expectancy and attention as covariates in sensitivity analyses.  
 We will evaluate H1 and H2 (eIMPACT -DM patients will exhibit greater improvement in 
A1c and HOMA score) using linear mixed modeling (SAS proc mixed) with an unstructured 
covariance matrix. Subject will be a random effect, and treatment group, time, and the ir 
interaction will be fixed effects. Separate models will be run for the primary (A1c) and secondary 
(HOMA score) outcomes. Treatment group x time interactions would indicate statistically 
significant treatment effects. For both A1c and HOMA score, we  will report the group means and 
standard errors; regression coefficients, 95% CIs, and p -values; and effect sizes (d’s). We will 
consider an absolute group difference in post -treatment A1c of ≥0.3% (d=0.50) to be clinically 
important (e.g., 5.9% for eIMPACT -DM group versus 6.2% for AC group; d=0.50). This A1c 
difference corresponds to annualized diabetes incidence rate of 4.0% for the eIMPACT -DM 
group versus 7.0% for the AC group.70 Because there is no absolute cut point distinguishing 
between normal and abnormal HOMA scores,119 we will consider a d≥0.50 (moderate effect 
size65) as clinically important. If we find that the eIMPACT -DM produces clinically important 
improvements in A1c and HOMA score (d’s ≥0.50), it would pave the way to an R01 -level RCT 
by (1) generating critical proof -of-concept data to support the premise and (2) providing 
preliminary effect sizes for eIMPACT -DM on A1c and HOMA score. Of note, the effect size 
estimate used in the primary power analysis for the future RCT will be based on the minimal 
clinically important differenc e in A1c instead of solely on this RCT’s results, as pi[INVESTIGATOR_4274].[ADDRESS_4013]’s results, along with 
other relevant data, to make a strong case that the selected effect size estimate is plausible and 
achieva ble. 
A set of planned subgroup analys es will be performed including only participants with 
pre-treatment A1c values between 5.70% -6.49%.  Another set of planned subgroup analyses will 
explore whether history of COVID -19 infection (defined as history of a positive COVID -[ADDRESS_4014] at 
trial entry) moderate s the effect of eIMPACT -DM on A1c and HOMA score.  
 
Exploratory Aim Analytic Plan  
 To explore whether somatic depressive symptoms moderate the effect of eIMPACT -DM 
on A1c and HOMA score, we will rerun the Primary Aim models stratified by [CONTACT_4319] . We expect ~60% of patients to have hyperphagia and/or hypersomnia and thus be 
coded as “yes” on the somatic symptoms group variable (see C3). The rem aining patients will 
be coded as “no.” We anticipate larger effect sizes for the somatic symptoms group.  We will 
consider an effect size difference between groups  of d≥0.50 to be clinically meaningful (e.g., 
IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/2021   Page 23 of 34 
 d=0.75 vs. 0.25 ). We will compute effect sizes of treatment group x somatic symptoms group x 
time interactions for A1c and HOMA score ; however, we expect these to be nonsignificant due 
to lower power.  If we find clinically important effect size differences between those with vs. 
without somatic depressive symptoms, we will modify the design of the R01 -level RCT as 
follows – recruitment: enroll 50% with and 50% without these symptoms; randomization: stratify 
on presence of these symptoms; and sample size: ensure sufficient po wer to detect [ADDRESS_4015] 
interactions.  
A set of planned subgroup analys es will be performed including only participants with 
pre-treatment A1c values between 5.70% -6.49%.  Another set of planned subgroup analyses will 
explore whether history of COVID -19 infectio n (defined as history of a positive COVID -[ADDRESS_4016] at 
trial entry) moderate s the effect of eIMPACT -DM on A1c and HOMA score.  
 
Incident Diabetes  
We will also explore whether eIMPACT -DM patients show a clinically relevant reduction 
(≥25% lower relative risk) in incident diabetes by [CONTACT_746] a Cox model with treatment group 
predicting time to diabetes onset.  
 
Sex as a Relevant Biological Variable  
In exploratory analyses, we will examine sex as a moderator of treatment effects on all 
outcomes by  [CONTACT_4320] x sex x time interactions in the Primary Aim models.  In 
addition, we will examine whether there  is sex difference  in the likelihood of being classified as 
having a somatic presentation of depression (i.e., those with hyperphagia an d/or hypersomnia) 
at baseline.  If a sex difference is found, it would influence the design of the future definitive RCT  
– e.g., we would likely additionally stratify randomization by [CONTACT_4321].  
 
12.0 Statistical Data Management  
 
Research materials that will be directly obtained from the participants are: (1) 
questionnaires; (2) standard measures of height, weight, and waist circumference; (3) blood 
samples; and (4) urine specimens to determine  pregnancy status (women only). Only members 
of the research team dire ctly involved in the proposed trial will have access to individually 
identifiable private information about the participants. All research material collected during the 
proposed project will be used for research purposes only and will be kept strictly conf idential. 
The only research materials that will be obtained from other sources are the recruitment data: 
potential participants’ medical records will be accessed in accordance with HIPAA and IRB 
regulations when the Eskenazi EMR is searched to generate a l ist of patients who satisfy the 
study inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
REDCap  software will be used to obtain the questionnaire data  and other data (e.g., 
height, weight, waist circumference, and urine pregnancy test results). Blood samples will be 
transferre d from the Indiana CTSI Clinical Research Center (CRC) to Translation Core Analyte 
Lab of the Indiana CTSI for secure storage until the time of assay. An Excel file reporting assay 
results will be securely sent to [CONTACT_4341] from the Translation Core Anal yte Lab. SPSS 
statistical software will be used for all data merging, cleaning, and reduction tasks.  
 
13.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
 Participants will be screened co in the privacy of their homes via phone or the Indiana 
CTSI Clinical Research Center (CRC). All procedures will take place in private rooms at the 
CRC, [CONTACT_4341]’s Cardio metabolic Behavioral Medicine Laboratory, the targeted primary care 
clinics, or a l ocation selected by [CONTACT_102], such as their home or a family member’s/f riend’s 
home (for calls and the computerized and telephonic components of the treatment groups ). All 
IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/[ADDRESS_4017] co mpleted  the 
required  Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) courses and will make every effort to 
ensure confidentiality. All electronic and hard copy data will be identified using only the unique 
participant number assigned when each indiv idual is enrolled in this study (participant identifying 
information will not be included). All electronic data will be saved on password -protected and 
encrypted computers and secure servers, and all hard copy data will be stored in secure and 
locked file cabinets. The key linking participant names with the participant numbers will be kept 
in a separate secure and locked file cabinet. Data will be analyzed and reported as an 
aggregate, with no individual identifying information.  Any leftover blood samples w ill be stored in 
[CONTACT_4342]'s laboratory.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_4018] Retention  
 
Participants in both treatment groups who continue to exhibit elevated depressive 
symptoms (PHQ -9 ≥10) at post -treatment will be will urged to follow -up with their primary care 
providers regarding their depression. Their providers will also receive a lette r from the study 
team indicating that their patient has completed participation in the treatment phase of the trial 
and continues to have elevated depressive symptoms. This letter will also urge physicians to 
follow -up with their patients and will provide a list of local mental health services.  
While the study duration  (i.e., project period)  is 2 years, all study documents will be kept 
up to 7 years after study completion. After this time, we will permanently delete patient 
identifying data and shred all pa per records, per Indiana State law. This process prevents any 
opportunity for a breach of confidentiality to occur.

 16.0 Appendix: Suicidal Ideation Protection Protocol  
 
Suicidal ideation protection protocols very similar to the one described below have 
previously been approved by [CONTACT_4325] o ur team (IRB #’s [PHONE_068], 1110007 119, and 
[PHONE_069]) . Those suicide management plans were constructed with input from Sandra 
Eskenazi  Mental Health Center leadership (Dean Babcock, Associate Vice President, and 
Michael Hughes), who concluded that the plans provide a high level of protect ion while 
minimizing disruption  to usual clinical activities. The informed consent form for this trial contains 
a section describing the steps that will be taken if an enrolled patient reports suicidal ideation on 
a questionnaire or spontaneously.  
 
ResNet Phone Screening Interview  
 
If a potential participant reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting 
him/herself (i.e., responds with a 1, 2, or 3 to PHQ -9 Item #9 or spontaneously reports suicidal 
ideation) during a ResNet telephone interv iew, the interview will be immediately stopped, and 
the ResNet research assistant will interview the potential participant to complete the Patient 
Suicidality Form. If the potential participant answers “no” to the clarifying question, the interview 
will pr oceed as normal. If the potential participant answers “yes” to the clarifying question, the 
participant will be asked the three suicide questions. If the potential participant answers “no” to 
all three suicide questions or if the patient answers “yes” only  to Question 3 (previous attempt) 
and the most recent attempt was ≥ 10 years ago, the interview will proceed as normal, and the 
completed Patient Suicidality Form will be given to the principal investigator. If the potential 
participant answers “yes” to an y of the three questions (for Question #[ADDRESS_4032] 10 years), the ResNet research assistant will inform the patient that the 
interview must be stopped and that a behavioral health clinician must be contact[CONTACT_4326]. The patient will also be told that the behavioral health clinician will call them 
back before the end of that day. The ResNet research assistant will then contact a behavioral 
health clinician, who will contact [CONTACT_4327] e nd of that day to determine the 
appropriate course of action (e.g., referral to the psychiatrist or to the Crisis Intervention Unit) 
and will notify the patient’s primary care provider.  After the situation is handled, the ResNet 
research assistant will con tact the behavioral health clinician.  If the behavioral health clinician 
considers the patient to be at acute risk of suicide (an exclusion criterion), the patient will be 
coded as ineligible. If the behavioral health clinician considers the patient not to be at acute risk 
of suicide, ResNet will attempt to contact [CONTACT_4328].  
 
In-Person Study Visits  
 
Suicidal ideation will be assessed using Item #[ADDRESS_4033] during the treatment phase.  Suicidal ideation will also be assessed using 
items #3 “thoughts of ending your life” and #14 “thoughts of death or dying” on the SCL -[ADDRESS_4034] -treatment visits.  
If an enrolled patient reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting 
him/herself (i.e., responds with a 1, 2, or 3 to PHQ -9 Item #9 ; responds with a 1, 2, 3, or 4 to 
SCL-20 Item #3 or #14;  or spontaneously re ports suicidal ideation) during an in -person study 
visit, the visit will be immediately stopped, and the research assistant or depression clinical 
specialist will interview the participant to complete the Patient Suicidality Form. If the potential 
particip ant answers “no” to the clarifying question, the visit will proceed as normal. If the 
IRB#: [PHONE_067]  
Version Date: 05/19/2021   Page 33 of 34 
 potential participant answers “yes” to the clarifying question, the participant will be asked the 
three suicide questions. If the participant answers “no” to all three su icide questions or if the 
patient answers “yes” only to Question 3 (previous attempt) and the most recent attempt was ≥ 
10 years ago, the visit will proceed as normal, and the completed Patient Suicidality Form will 
be given to the principal investigator. If the participant answers “yes” to any of the three 
questions (for Question #[ADDRESS_4035] 10 years), the research 
assistant or depression clinical specialist will immediately contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stewart.  If [CONTACT_4341] 
cannot be reached, contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bateman . [CONTACT_4341] (a clinical psychologist) and [CONTACT_4336] 
(the trial psychiatrist ) will review the case as soon as possible, but no later than the same day, 
to determine the appropriate course of action (e.g., interview the patient to obtain further 
information, immediately contact [CONTACT_102]’s primary care provider and/or behavioral health 
clinician to involve them in the decision -making process, consult with clinicians at Sandra 
Eskenazi Mental Health Center, escort th e patient to the Crisis Intervention Unit, and/or contact 
[CONTACT_4329]).  The depression 
clinical specialist will also notify the participant’s primary care provider if s/he was not involv ed in 
the decision -making process. Regardless of the exact course of action, the study team will 
ensure that the participant is connected to the appropria te existing clinical services. If the 
patient’s primary care provider no longer believes that the pati ent is appropriate for this trial 
following a situation, s/he will be withdrawn.  
   
Study Calls  
 
Suicidal ideation will be assessed using Item #[ADDRESS_4036] study calls competed by [CONTACT_4330].  
If an enrolled patient reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting 
him/herself (i.e., responds with a 1, 2, or 3 to PHQ -9 Item #9 or spontaneously reports suicidal 
ideation) during a study calls, the research assistant or depression clinical specialist will 
immediately interview the participant to complete the Patient Suicidality Form.  If the potential 
participant  answers “no” to the clarifying question, the call will proceed as normal. If the potential 
participant answers “yes” to the clarifying question, the participant will be asked the three 
suicide questions. If the participant answers “no” to all three suicid e questions or if the 
participant answers “yes” only to Question 3 (previous attempt) and the most recent attempt 
was >10 years ago, the call will proceed as normal, and the completed Patient Suicidality Form 
will be given to the principal investigator.  I f the participant answers “yes” to any of the three 
questions (for Question #[ADDRESS_4037] 10 years) or 
prematurely terminates the call, the research assistant or depression clinical specialist will 
immediately contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stewart. If [CONTACT_4341] cannot be reached, contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bateman. Drs. 
Stewart and Bateman  will review the case as soon as possible, but no later than the same day, 
to determine the appropriate course of action (e.g., interview the patient to obtain further 
information, immediately contact [CONTACT_102]’s primary care provider and/or behavioral h ealth 
clinician to involve them in the decision -making process, consult with clinicians at  Sandra 
Eskenazi Mental Health Center, refer the patient to the Crisis Intervention Unit, and/or contact 
[CONTACT_4331] h arm and i s refusing all care). The depression 
clinical specialist will also notify the participant’s primary care provider if s/he was not involved in 
the decision -making process. Regardless of the exact course of action, the study team will 
ensure that the partici pant is connected to the appropri ate existing clinical services.  If the 
patient’s primary care provider no longer believes that the patient is appropriate for this trial 
following a situation, s/he will be withdrawn.

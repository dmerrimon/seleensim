5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph)
Rib fractures are one of the most common injuries in trauma patients. These fractures are associated 
with significant pain as well as decreased ability to inspi[INVESTIGATOR_632463] , which 
together lead to pulmonary complications and a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Peripheral 
nerve blocks as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_632464].  Howe ver, a single -injection nerve block lasts less than 24 hours; and, even a continuous 
nerve block is generally limited to 3-[ADDRESS_844339] to local anesthetic -induced nerve blocks, a prolonged  block lasting a 
few weeks/months may be provided by [CONTACT_632489] a process called “ cryoneurolysis ”. 
The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of cryoanalgesia to decrease pain and improve 
pulmonary mechanics in patients with rib fractures.  
6. SPECIFIC AIMS
The ultimate objective of the proposed line of research  is to determine if cryoanalgesia is an effective 
treatment for pain associated with rib fractures ; and, if this analgesic modality improves pulmonary 
mechanics measured with incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  
Specific Aim 1:  To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia  for rib 
fracture(s) , intercostal nerve cryo neurolysis  improves maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_12194] . 
Hypothesis 1a:  The maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_632465] [primary endpoint] as well as at other time points following the 
procedure  [secondary end points] with intercostal cryoanalgesia as compared single -
injection local anesthetic -based intercostal nerve blocks [measured with an incentive 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007]].  
Hypothesis 1b:  The maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_632466] a percentage of the baseline will be 
significantly increased  on the day following the procedure [secondary endpoint of greatest 
interest], as well as at other time points following the procedure  [secondary end points] with 
intercostal cryoanalgesia as compared with single -injection local anesthetic -based intercostal 
nerve blocks [measured with an incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007]].

nerve cryoneurolysis  decreases the  pain associated with  rib fracture (s). 
 
Hypothesis 2a:  The severity of rib fracture  pain at rest  will be significantly decreased within the 
12 months following the procedure  with intercostal cryo neurolysis  as compared with subjects

intercostal nerve blocks [measured using the Numeric Rating Scale for pain] . 
 
Hypothesis 2c:  The incidence  of chronic  pain will be significantly decreased 6 and 12  months  
following a rib fracture  with intercostal cryo eurolysis  as compared with subjects  recei ving 
single -injection local anesthetic -based intercostal nerve blocks [measured using the Numeric 
Rating Scale for pain].  
 
Hypothesis 2d:  The severity  of chronic  pain will be significantly decreased 6 and 12 months  
following a rib fracture  with intercostal cryo neurolysis  as compared with subjects  recei ving 
single -injection local anesthetic -based intercostal nerve blocks [measured using the Numeric 
Rating Scale for pain].  
 
 
7. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Rib fractures represent a significant source of morbidity in trauma patients, with approximately 10% of 
trauma patients presenting with rib fractures.[ADDRESS_844340] been shown to improve 
pain scores, peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_29339], and arterial oxygen saturation on room air.3 However, 
intercostal nerve blocks are not without risk and incidence of pneumothorax has been reported as 1.4% 
for each individual intercostal nerve that is blocked.[ADDRESS_844341] been reported to resolve in as little as six hours,5 likely due to 
the high vascularity and consequent uptake of local anesthetic from the intercostal space.  
 
An alternative analgesic technique is cryoneurolysis,  consisting of the application of 
exceptionally low temperatures to reversibly  ablate peripheral nerves, resulting in temporary pain 
relief termed “cryoanalgesia” .6 The intense cold temperature at the probe tip produces Wallerian 
degeneration —a reversible breakdown of the nerve axon —subsequently inhibiting transmission of 
afferent and efferent signals.  Because the nerve endoneurium, perineurium, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_632468] [ADDRESS_844342], the axon regenerates along the exoskeleton 
at a rate of approximately 1 -2 mm/day.  While 
cryoneurolysis of peripheral nerves through 
surgical incisions has been commonly used to 
treat pain since 1961, the development of cryo 
probes that may be inserted percutaneously 
promise a revolutio n in the use of this modality.  
The co mbination of newly -designed narrow -gauge 
probes ( upper  right) and ultrasound now make 
percutaneous cryoanalgesia as simple as placing 
a peripheral nerve block:  the probe tip is inserted 
adjacent to the target nerve under ultras ound guidance, and a series of 2 -minute freezing cycles are 
administered followed by [CONTACT_143405].  The procedure is essentially the same as placing an 
ultrasound -guided peripheral nerve block; however, instead of injecting local anesthetic, a 
gas circulates through the probe, inducing cold at the tip and freezing the target nerve.   
Nothing remains within the patient and there is no external equipment to prepare or manage.  
Importantly, cryoneurolysis an d the probes are already approved by [CONTACT_632490],  so no additional regulatory approval is 
required for the proposed clinical trial.  
 
Theoretical benefits of cryoneurolysis include an ultra -long duration of pain control  without opi[INVESTIGATOR_143384], no catheter management/removal  (reducing infection risk) , the lack of an infusion pump 
and anesthetic reservoir to carry, an extraordinarily -low risk of infection (approaching zero), and no 
risk of local anesthetic toxicity, catheter dislodgement or leakage.   With a single 8 -minute 
percu taneous cryoneurolysis procedure consisting of several fr eeze/defrost cycles, a  truncation of 
sensory nerve co nduction is induced for [ADDRESS_844343] practice.

 Post-block pain levels and spi[INVESTIGATOR_632470] 4 Days 1, 2, 7 Pain levels, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556],  sleep disturbances due to pain, and 
incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_632471]  [day of discharge recorded]  
 
Months 0.5,  1, 1.5 , 2 Pain levels, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], sleep disturbances due to pain, and  
3, 6, and 12  pain interference collected  [if subject has spi[INVESTIGATOR_632472]]   
 
 
Subjects will be individuals who present to one of the UCSD hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632473] (s) and 
significant pain .  The University of [LOCATION_012] will be following the same protocol and the subjects from 
both institutions will be combined for the analysis.  Those who consent to participate in this study will 
have standard ultrasound -guided intercostal  nerve blocks  administered  with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5%  (with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) , 3 mL/level  of each fracture rib as well as one level above and one level below . 
 
Treatment group assignment (randomization).   Subjects will be allocated to one of two possible 
treatments  stratified by [CONTACT_632491]. bilateral fractures : 
   1.  active  cryoneurolysis  (sham  local anesthetic intercostal blocks)  
2.  sham  cryoneurolysis ( active  local anesthetic intercostal blocks ) 
 
Computer -generated r andomization lists will be used to create  sealed, opaque randomization 
envelopes with the treatment group assignment enclosed in each envelope labeled with the 
randomization number.  
 
The specific intercostal nerves  targeted will depend on the injury  site. The treatment sites will be 
cleansed with chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol.  Using the optimal ultrasound 
transducer for the specific anatomic location and subject anatomy (linear vs curvilinear array), the 
target nerve s will be identified in a transverse cros s-sectional (short axis) view.   The intercostal nerve 
of each fractured rib as well as the level above and below will be treated with the protocol below:  
 
Intercostal nerve block procedure:   The target nerve will be visualized with ultrasound.  Local 
anesthetic (1% lidocaine) will be used to infiltrate the skin and underlying muscle at each entry point.  
A [ADDRESS_844344].   For subjects randomized to active cryo, 3 mL of normal saline will be injected into the muscle 
superficial to the nerve; and for subjects randomized to sham cryo, 3 mL of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% (with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238])  will be injected perineurally to provide the intercostal nerve block.  
 
Cryoneurolysis procedure :  Cryoneurolysis probes are available  for a console neurolysis device 
(PainBlocker, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_143391], Farmers Branch, [LOCATION_007] ) that either (1) pass nitrous oxide to the tip inducing 
freezing temperatures; or, (2) vent the nitrous oxide at the base of the probe so that no gas reaches 
the probe tip, resu lting in no temperature change .  The latter is a sham procedure since without the 
temperature change, no ice ball forms  and therefore the target nerve is not affected.  An 
angiocatheter /introducer  will be inserted beneath the ultrasound transducer and directed until the 
probe tip is immediately adjacent to the target nerve .  The angi ocatheter needle will be removed, 
leaving the angiocatheter through which the appropriate Epi[INVESTIGATOR_632474].  The cryoneurolysis device will be triggered using 2 cycles of 2 -minute 
gas activation (active or sham)  separated by 1-minute defrost  periods .  For active probes, the nitrous 
oxide will be deployed to the tip where a drop in temperature to -70°C will result in cryoneurolysis.  
For the sham probes, the nitrous oxide will be vented prior to reaching the probe shaft, resulting in a 
lack of perineural temperature change.  
 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 5 The process will be repeated with the same treatment probe for any additional  nerve s (e.g., all 
nerves will receive either active cryoneurolysis or sham/placebo, and not a mix of the two possible 
treatments).  
 
For subjects at the University of [LOCATION_012], their anthropomorphic, baseline, procedure, and post -
procedure data will be recorded on the same case report form as at the University [LOCATION_004] San 
Diego and faxed to the investigators at UC San Diego following the procedure.  These faxed 
documents will remain in electronic form (eFax) on the Principal Investigator’s password -protected, 
encrypted, UCSD -owned MacBook computer.  Investigators at UC San Diego will  do all of the follow -
up data collection by [CONTACT_632492].  
 
 
Outcome m easurements  (end points) .  Anesthesia providers  will perform all measures and 
assessments , which  will include:    
 
1. Pain :  measured on  the 11-point NRS of pain intensity  
 
2. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]  
 
3. Pain interference:   measured using the Brief Pain Inventory (which includes the pain scores 
of #1 above)  
 
4. Sleep disturbances  (#):  due to pain  
 
5. Pulmonary Mechanics:  measured by [CONTACT_632493][INVESTIGATOR_632475] a  handheld incentive 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_632476] (AARC) clinical practice 
guideline.[ADDRESS_844345] of three measurements will be recorded as the maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_632477] . 
 
Statistical Analysis:  The primary endpoint is the maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_632478].  There is no accepted minimal clinically -relevant change in 
incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_632479].   However, the median (IQR) of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_632480](s) is 1250 (750 -1750) mL;8 and, ISV<1000 mL is associated with an increased risk of acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] .8  We will therefore use the difference between 1250 and 1000 (250 mL) as the 
minimal clinically -relevant difference.   However, there is high variability in the reported increase in 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_632481]9 and serratus plane blocks ,[ADDRESS_844346] deviations 
(SDs). Therefore an interquartile  range of 250 -50 = 200 mL (Hernandez et al. 2019) corresponds to, 
approximately, an SD of 200/1.35 = 148 mL.   Assuming this SD of 14 8 mL, a sample size of n= 7 per 
group provides 80% power to detect a group difference of d= 250 mL per group with two sided Type 1 
Error 5%.   To allow for a larger -than-anticipated SD, we will enroll 10 subjects per group with an 
evaluable primary outcome measure (n=20 for both groups combined).  Accounting for drop -outs, we 
request a maximum enrollment of 30 subjects.  
 
"Continuous data will be summarized with mean, SDs, medians, quartiles, and ranges;  and 
displayed with box -and-whisker plots by [CONTACT_632494].  Key baseline characteristics will be 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 6 tested between groups using two -sample t -tests, and summarized with Cohen’s D, for continuous 
measures; and Fisher’s Exact test for categorical variables.   The primary outcome is maximum 
incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_632479] (ISV) measured in mL on POD 1. The group difference will be tested 
using Welch’s two -sample test.  Secondary outcomes will also be tested with the two -sample t -test.  
No multiplicity adjustments wi ll be applied for these secondary outcomes. The Wilcoxon signed -rank 
test will be used as a sensitiv ity analysis.   Secondary analyses will include a Mixed Model of 
Repeated Measures with fixed -effects for time, time -by-group, unilateral vs bilateral, and the number 
of fractures.  The model will treat time as a categorical variable and will assume a compound 
symmetric c orrelation and heterogeneous  variance with respect to time. The estimated mean 
difference between groups at the final scheduled timepoint will be the parameter of interest and will 
be tested using Kenward -Roger degrees of freedom.  Out - comes only measured at baseline and a 
single fo llow-up timepoint will be analyses with Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The dependent 
variable will be change from baseline, and covariates will include group, baseline outcome, unilateral 
vs bilateral, and the number of fractures.   Missing data is not ex pected due to the short follow -up in 
this study.  However, if missing data issues arise, we will use  multiple imputation which is robust to 
covariate -dependent Missing at Random, and tippi[INVESTIGATOR_632482]."  
 
 
10. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
Inclusion criteria:   Adult patients of at least 18 years of age, (1) having a total of 1-[ADDRESS_844347] 3 cm distal to the costo -transverse joint sustained within the previous 3 days (bilateral fractures  
are acceptable, but the total of the two sides combined must not exceed 6 fractures) ; (2) regional 
anesthetic requested by [CONTACT_632495] ; and, (3) accepting of a cryoneurolysis procedure . 
 
Exclusion criteria :  (1) chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (daily use within the 2 weeks prior to surgery  and duration 
of use > 4 weeks ; of note, any testing for opi[INVESTIGATOR_632483], but as 
standard of care ); (2) pregnancy; (3) incarceration; (4) inability to communicate with the investigators; 
(5) morbid obesity (body mass index > 40 kg/m2); (6) possessing any contraindication specific to 
cryoneurolysis such as a localized infection at the treatment site, cryoglobulinemia, cold urticaria and 
Reynaud’s Syndrome ; (7) any patient unable to correctly perform incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_632484]; (8) any patient with any degree of decreased mental capacity as 
determined by [CONTACT_632496]; (9) any reason an investigator believes study participation would 
not be in the best interest of the potential subject ; (10) flail chest; (11) chest tube; (12) fracture of the 
1st rib on either side ; or (1 3) any moderate or severe pain (NRS>3) unrelated to the rib fracture(s), as 
best determined by [CONTACT_632497] . 
 
11. RECRUITMENT AND PROCEDURES PREPARATORY TO RESEARCH  
Study inclusion will be proposed to eligible patients at one of the UCSD Medical Center hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] 
(listed in #3 above) —by [CONTACT_632498]’s 
clinical care (HIPAA requirements will be adhered to).  There is no minimum number of hours or days 
from the time of fracture until the time of study participation and no requirement for overnight 
admission.  If a patient desires study participation, written, informed consent will be obtained  using an 
IRB-approved informed consent form .   
 
Selection for inclusion will not be based on sex, race, or socioeconomic status.  For women of 
childbearing age with the possibility of pregnancy, a sample of urine is always collected for a 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_844348] prior to an invasive procedure —regardless of study participation.  Pregnant patients 
will be excluded from study participation.   
 
12. INFORMED CONSENT  
When  a prospective subject desires , they will be provided information on the study purpose and 
protocol, as well as have any questions answered.  Candidates who meet inclusion and exclusion 
criteria and desire study enrollm ent will be scheduled for treatment , usually the same day or the 
following day depending on staff /equipment  availability , anti-coagulation status , and other factors .  
Written informed consent will be attained prior t o any measurements or procedures .  This will occur in 
private patient car e rooms, so that subjects may f eel comfortable asking questions.  
Subjects will be provided ample privacy and time for decision making . Surrogate consent will not be 
accepted; therefore, if human subjects cannot provide consent on their own, they will not be offered 
study enrollment.  Consent by [CONTACT_28045]’s Legally Authorized Representative is unacceptable for 
study enrollment.  Of not e, minors (age < 18 years) will not be offered enroll ment .  Therefore, assent 
will not be accepted during the informed consent process . 
 
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
Potential study subjects may simply decline enrollment.   They will still receive our standard -of-care 
analgesics.  
 
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
1. Infection.  There is the potential risk of infection since subjects  will have a probe inserted through 
the skin.  Since there will be nothing left going through the skin or in the subject after the probe is 
withdrawn, the risk of infection is very small and there has never been a report of permanent 
injury due to infection following cryoneurolysis . 
2. Bleeding.  The probe does not have an open tip and is not particularly sharp, so there is a very 
low risk of having any type of bleeding as a result of treatment.  However, if it was to happen, we 
would hold pressure until the bleeding stopped.  
3. The skin where the nerve is frozen could lose or gain color if the nerve is particularly close to the 
surface.  However, this has never been reported for deeper nerves and using the probe th at will 
be used for this study.  
4. Since a nerve will be frozen, there is the chance of nerve injury.  However, in multiple  decades of 
using percutaneous cryoneurolysis on peripheral nerves , only a single case of “neuritis” (nerve 
irritation) has been reported in medical journals, and this resolved  after a few months.  
5. There is the risk of loss of confidentiality.  The following procedures will be done to maintain 
confidentiality:  written, paper forms will be kept in a locked medical.  Computerized records 
containing personal health information will be stored on password -protected and encrypted 
computers.  
6. The intercostal nerves run on the under surface of the ribs. Inserting a cryoneurolysis probe close 
enough to freeze these nerves therefore has a risk of injuring the lining of the lung resulting in 
pneumothorax. The risk of pneumothorax during such a proc edure with ultrasound guidance is 
estimated from the literature as [ADDRESS_844349] advanced training and years of experience that should further reduce this risk.  
7. Pain.  Cryoneurolysis has been demonstrated to provide pain relief for various chronic pain 
indications; but, it has not been rigorously investigated for acute pain states such as rib fractures.  
Therefore, subjects randomized to receive cryoneurolysis of the intercostal nerve(s) might 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_844350] 6 -8 hours after treatment than subjects receiving a local 
anesthetic -based intercostal nerve block; but, they also might experience less pain for the 
remainder of 2 months during the period of fracture healing.  
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQUACY OF RESOURCES  
During the treatment , subjects will be continuously monitored with pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood 
pressure cuffs, and EKG (stan dard for nerve blocks ).  If one is not already present, s ubjects will 
receive an IV so that emergency medications could be given, if needed.  As described above, probes  
will be placed under sterile conditions as is standard -of-care for any percutaneous cryoneurolysis . 
 
Following treatment , the subjects will be contact[CONTACT_632499] [ADDRESS_844351] a physicians’ pager and cellular 
phone numbers available to respond 24 hours/day and 7 days/week for at least the first week 
following treatment . 
 
The risks to confidentiality are the release of names/ telephone numbers/ demographic data (e.g. 
weight, age, height), which will be minimized by [CONTACT_143434] -protected computers and case 
report forms that will be stored in locked offices . 
 
Subjects will be given clear instructions to call an investigator with any questions or concerns 
regarding their study participation.  If a patient experiences an injury that is directly caused by [CONTACT_62315], medical care will be provided  at the medical center.  No other compensation is offered.  Any 
adverse events will be reported to the IRB using the standard adverse events reporting and upon 
continuing review (depending on severity, as defined by [CONTACT_1201]).  
 
16. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING DATA ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT  
Disposition of data.  The original, hard -copy signed informed consent forms and case report forms 
will be stored within an investigator’s locked office; and they will  remain with the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_25653] [ADDRESS_844352] 7 years . 
 
17. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
For subjects randomized to receive a sham cryo treatment :  There will be no difference b etween 
being in this study and deciding against participation .  Therefore, there is no potential for direct 
benefits from this sham  cryo “treatment” . 
 
For subjects randomized to receive active cryoneurolysis :  It is our hope that patients have a 
decrease in their acute and chronic rib fracture  pain (which might permit a decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_632485] -related nausea/vomiting)  and improved pulmonary mechanics measured by 
[CONTACT_594678][INVESTIGATOR_038] . 
 
Possible benefits to others:  Future patients may benefit if it is determined that cryoneurolysis  
decreases pain and improves pulmonary function in patients with rib fractures .  In addition, with the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817], any decrease in opi[INVESTIGATOR_632486] a welcome development.

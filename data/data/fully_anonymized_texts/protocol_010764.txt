1. STUDY OVERVIEW, PURPOSE, AND BACKGROUND 
 
 1.1. Significance of Distress am ong lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGBT) cancer survivors 
 
To date, LGBT survivors have been  invisible in the cancer contr ol literature.
1,[ADDRESS_933798] co mmon side effects cited by [CONTACT_688361],10,11 is 1.7 times more 
common among LGBT survivors,12 and is linked to increased morbidity13 and mortality.14 Lesbian survivors 
report poorer qua lity of life8 and more anxiety and depression pos t-diagnosis than heterosexu al women,9 while 
gay male survivors report worse mental health and more fear of cancer recurrence than heterosexual men.15,16 
Given the large number of LGB T survivors (between 420,000-1,000 ,000 living in the [LOCATION_002]17,18), higher 
rates of distress among these s urvivors, and the link between d istress, morbidity, and mortality, interventions 
targeting distress am ong LGBT cancer survivors are urgently nee ded.  There is also a need f or interventions that 
are socioculturally tailored t o the needs of this population.19,20 Targeting psychological distress in LGBT 
survivors through a partner-assis ted intervention could reduce the public health burden of long-term cancer 
survivorship by [CONTACT_688362] s urvivors21-23 and promoting intervention 
adherence.22-30 
 
1.2. Exercise as intervention to reduce distress 
Receiving a diagnosis of cancer ca n cause psychological distres s.31   Distress among LGBT cancer survivors is 
further exacerbated by [CONTACT_688363]-specifi c stressors, such as discrim ination based on sexual orientation and 
invisibility/non-rec ognition of caregivers.1,32 Exercise, including walking and r esistance training, is safe a nd 
well-tolerated and improves distre ss in heterosexual cancer sur vivors.33-36 Our intervention, EXCAP©® 
(Exercise for Cancer Patients) , is a standardized, daily, 6 wee k, home-based, progressive exercise program.  In 
phase II randomized controlled t rials (RCTs) of this program, s urvivors (N = 91) who completed EXCAP©® 
demonstrated improvements in d istress, quality of life, and mar kers of inflammation.33,37,38  Adherence to the 
intervention was good (79% complet ion rate), and there were no adverse events.33-36  As EXCAP©® is a 
standardized exercise program , it is easy to prescribe and tail or to survivors; it is home-based, exportable, and 
may be more palatable than weekly psychotherapy.39,[ADDRESS_933799], survivors who exercised with a 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / [ADDRESS_933800] of exercise on distress: Cancer influences psychological 
distress on several levels. First , receiving a diagnosis of can cer can produce symptoms of depression and 
anxiety. 31,[ADDRESS_933801] both cancer 
survivors and their 
caregivers,2,45-49 
reduce the provision 
of social support

processes
47 and 
increase activation of 
markers of inflammation.48 Increased activation 
of the HPA axis and concomitant i ncreases in systemic inflammat ion can result in inc reased report of 
psychological distress.49-51 In previous studies, cortisol, C -reactive protein, and serum a myloid A are 
particularly linked t o report of distress.52-57  
Therefore, EXCAP©® is designed to reduce distre ss on two levels.  On a psychologi cal level, participation in 
exercise serves as a form of be havioral activation and increase s self-efficacy, factors that have been shown to 
reduce distress.22-30 On a physiological level, exercis e affects biological processe s associated with the stress 
response, as measured by [CONTACT_688364]-relate d biological endpoints (Figure 2).[ADDRESS_933803] changes in distress (p<0.05, r=0 .12).[ADDRESS_933804] distress on a psychological level by

1.5 Preliminary data 
The preliminary data presented il lustrates four key points: 1) Disparities exist among LGBT cancer survivors; 
Figure 2:  Biops ychosocial model of d yadic interventio n
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           2) LGBT survivors and thei r partners want specific 
interventions, 3) EXCAP©® is effective in 
reducing distress, and 4) recruiting and retaining 
LGBT cancer survivors and caregivers is feasible.  
Study 1) Distress is prevalent among LGBT 
cancer survivors: In secondary data analyses of 
large datasets (BRFSS, LIVESTRONG), we 
found that LGBT cancer survivors reported 2.96 
more days per month of poor mental health 
(p=0.02), 60 fewer minutes of physical activity 
per week (p=0.01), and 1.9 times greater odds of 
difficulty with social support (p=0.04) than their 
heterosexual counterparts.12 (See Figure 3.) 
Study 2) LGBT cancer survivors and their 
partners want specific interven tions: In a focus group conducte d with 10 lesbian and gay cancer survivors and 
their caregivers, we ([CONTACT_688412] , with consultation from mentors ) found that both  cancer survivors and their 
partners experience psychologica l distress, including concerns about the impact of treatment on their 
relationship and about cancer recu rrence. Multiple dyads report ed that this distress directly affected their 
relationship with one another and that few resources are availa ble for cancer survivors in the LGBT community. 
All LGBT survivors and their caregivers we spoke with indicated th at they would be interested in a tailored 
exercise intervention. 
Study 3) The EXCAP intervention is effective in reducing distre ss: In a secondary analysis of [CONTACT_142003]’s 
study of EXCAP©® for prostate cancer survivor s (n=58), we found that EXCAP©® significantly reduced distress 
as measured by [CONTACT_688367].  Compared with usual care control, 6 weeks of EXCAP©® was 
associated with a 7.24 point reduction in the POMS Total score (p = 0.02; manuscript under review).38  This 
secondary analysis also included evaluation of immune function;  while markers of HPA axis function and early 
inflammation were not included in this dataset, preliminary ana lysis of immune function pi[INVESTIGATOR_688352]. 
Study 4) It is feasible to recruit and retain LGBT cancer survi vors and their partners in an exercise intervention: 
[CONTACT_688412] was recently (2013) awarded a seed grant to conduct a  feasibility study, entit led “Dyadic Exercise 
Intervention for Heterosexual a nd LGBT Cancer Survivors and The ir Caregivers.”  This study, conducted with 
the input of the mentorship team, was designed to assess the feasibility and acceptability  of delivering an 
exercise intervention to heteros exual and LGBT dyads, as well a s establishing preliminary efficacy of the 
same outcome measures to be used in the proposed Phase II RCT.  We developed a novel, dyadic delivery 
method for EXCAP©® (EXCAP-PA; see Appendix), involv ing training caregivers to sup port survivors in 
exercising, as well as new LGBT recruitment and retention metho dologies.  We have recruited and retained 20 
LGBT survivors and their divers e caregivers, successfully deliv ered the intervention, and had good adherence 
and acceptance.  We also built strong community collaborations and partnerships.

heterosexual (N =5,386) cancer survivors (all cancer types)
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / [ADDRESS_933805] udy is that among LGBT survivo rs, EXCAP-PA, incorporating caregiver 
support, will be more efficac ious than survivor-only EXCAP
©® in improving biopsychosocial aspects of 
distress: both self-reported psyc hological distress and biologi cal endpoints associated w ith distress. Exploratory 
hypotheses are that improvement i n distress, increased social s upport from the caregiv er, and intervention 
adherence will be positively related, and that caregivers will also benefit from partner-a ssisted intervention.

Participants in this randomize d controlled trial will be 70 LGB T cancer survivors and thei r 70 caregivers (a total 
of 70 dyads/140 individuals).  A car egiver is defined as any in dividual whom the cancer survivor nominates as 
having provided emotional support  or tangible assistance withou t pay during the survivor’s  cancer experience.  
No restriction will be  placed on caregivers in terms of relatio nship with the cancer survivor; they can be family 
members, friends, romantic part ners, or community members. 
 3.2 Gender, Age, and Racial/Et hnic Origin of Participants 
 
Based on the characteristics of sam ples recruited for previous exercise studies  run out of the Physical Exercise 
Activity Kinesiology Laboratory ( PEAK  Lab) at the University of [COMPANY_002] ster, we anticipate that the sa mple for 
the current study will be 49% male and 51% female.  Average age  will be 67 years.  The ethnic composition of 
the sample will be approximate ly 92% White/Caucasian, 15% Afric an-American, and 3% Asian; 10% will 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           report a Hispanic/Latino ethni city. Children, as defined by [CONTACT_688368], will not be include d, as cancer survivors under [ADDRESS_933810] a ve ry different experience of can cer and caregiving than a dult (age 21+)  cancer 
survivors. 
 
3.3  Inclusion Criteria (Survivors): To be included in the study, cancer survivors must:

Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0            
4. PARTICIPANT IDENTIFICATION, RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT 
 
 4.1 Human Subjects Involvement: The proposed RCT aims to recru it 70 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and  
transgender (LGBT) cancer survi vors who have completed treatmen t (surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy) or 
who are on continued, indefinite a djuvant treatment, so as to h ave a final, evaluab le sample of [ADDRESS_933814] will also recruit c aregivers (broadly defi ned) of the above cancer 
survivors.  Each recruited cancer  survivor will be asked to nam e a person who they feel provided care 
(emotional, informational, tangi ble, etc.) during their cancer experience, with no further s trictures placed on this 
relationship in terms of type or  duration. The caregiver will b e approached to participate in the RCT. Thus the 
sample will consist of 70 LGBT su rvivors (60 evaluable) and the ir caregivers (140 i ndividuals total/120 
evaluable).  Recruitment and primary analyses will specifically  target the LGBT cancer survivor.   
 
LGBT survivors will be randomized to one of 2 arms: Arm 1, a no vel, partner-assisted , LGBT-specific 
framework incorporating EXCAP©® (Exercise for Cancer Patient s, a standardized, daily, 6 week, progressive 
walking and resistance traini ng program), in which both survivo rs and caregivers will receive EXCAP©® 
materials and be instructed in t heir use together, or Arm 2, a survivor-only  version of EXCAP©®, in which only 
the cancer survivor will receive EXCAP©® materials and be instructed i n their use. There will be 35 LGB T 
survivors randomized to each arm  (30 evaluable), along with the ir 35 caregivers (30 evaluable).  Survivors and 
caregivers will be assessed before and after the 6 week interve ntion in both arms.  The LGBT survivor will be 
the primary unit of analysis; data  collected from caregivers wi ll be used for exploratory purposes only. 
 
Assuming an 85% retention rate a nd an initial sample of 70 surv ivors, 60 LGBT survivors will complete the 
study. Because LGBT survivors are the primary unit of analysis,  survivors will be invite d to return for follow-
up assessment even if their caregivers are unavailable.  Study interventions will begin on Study Day 0 and 
continue for 6 weeks (42 days) . The exercise intervention, EXCA P©®, is a standardized intervention developed 
and tested by [CONTACT_688369] (URMC).  T he actual list of 
exercises, and the framework f or the partner-assisted EXCAP-PA,  is provided in the Appendix.  Each 
participant will be monitored by a n American College of Sports Medicine Certified Exercise PhysiologistSM.  
Assessments will be made with validated and methodologically so und measures includ ing self-report 
questionnaires, assays for expr ession of biological endpoints, weekly diaries, and actigraphy monitoring.   
 
No special classes of participan ts such as fetuses, neonates, p regnant women, prisoners , institutionalized 
individuals or other vulnerable  populations will  be recruited. 
 
Children, as defined by [CONTACT_163000] l Institutes of Health Grant s Policy Statement, will not be included, as 
cancer survivors under [ADDRESS_933815] a very 
different experience of cancer t reatment and caregiving than ad ult (age 21+)  cancer survivors.  
 
All data will be gathered at the PEAK Lab and the URMC Cancer C ontrol Unit. 
 
4.2 Method of Participant Ident ification and Recruitment 
 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           4.2.1 LGBT Survivor Recruitment:  All data will be gathered from p articipants [ADDRESS_933816] completed tr eatments or caregivers of cancer 
survivors; both survivors and caregivers are able to read and u nderstand English.  Potentially 
eligible cancer survivors will  be contact[CONTACT_688370].   
 
1) Distal identification of URMC patients: First, the study team will monitor URMC patients 
over the age of [ADDRESS_933817] been di agnosed with cancer (any sit e), who have completed cancer 
treatment or are on indefinite t reatment, and who are LGBT iden tified or same-sex partnered.  
This monitoring will be done thr ough e-record as well as with T riNetX, a clinical query tool that 
allows researchers to pull specif ic subject criteria from e-rec ord.  Search criteria for TriNetX will 
include “malignant neoplasm” as well as other specific cancer d iagnoses, report of being 
“partnered” or having a “same-s ex partner” on sociodemographic questions, or identifying as 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transge nder.  Use of TriNetX softwar e requires an RSRB approved 
protocol; any data from this ser vice is transferred to the stud y team via a secure web-based 
interface.  If an LGBT cancer sur vivor identified via TriNetX i s deemed eligible after a review of 
their medical record, the study team will contact [CONTACT_606605] ’ physician to ensure eligibility and 
will then send the survivor a letter, from their physician and the study team, explaining the study 
and its requirements.  A brochur e providing further details wil l also be enclosed (see 
Recruitment Materials).  Survivors will have the option to opt out of further contact; if the 
survivor is willing to continue, a study team member will make contact [CONTACT_688371].   
 
2) Direct referral of URMC patients: Second, study staff work with physicians, nurses, and 
other care providers in URMC c linics to identify patients who h ave been diagnosed with cancer 
(any site), who have completed can cer treatment or are on indef inite treatment, and who have 
identified themselves as LGBT  or same-sex partnered to their ca re providers.  After being 
referred by [CONTACT_688372] a  review of their medical record, 
survivors will be sent a lette r from their physician and the st udy team, explaining the study and 
its requirements.  Study team mem bers will also be present in t he URMC clinics of affiliated 
care providers so that cancer sur vivors who are scheduled for a ppointments and who might be 
eligible can be referred by [CONTACT_688373].  Following the referral by [CONTACT_449818], the treatment t eam will introduce the study tea m member, who will meet with 
the survivor and explain the st udy either in person or over the  phone.  If a caregiver has 
accompanied the survivor to the clinic, they will be informed a bout the study at the same time, 
either in person or via phone.  If th e survivor (and caregiver)  is willing to continue, a study team 
member will conduct screening.  L etters and brochures describin g the study will be sent to the 
homes of survivors and caregiver s contact[CONTACT_688374].   
 
3) Community recruitment and referral: We will also advertise the study on the University of 
[COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center “Clin ical Trials” website, in local ne wspapers, through flyers posted 
in the community, and through the PEAK Lab Facebook page.  To e nsure recruitment of LGBT 
cancer survivors, we will also recruit through community groups , such as those hosted by [CONTACT_688375], who specifically 
provide services to the  LGBT community; we will leave brochures  and tear-off posters at both 
locations and present the st udy to staff at both locations.  We  will recruit through newspaper 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           advertisements; through website pos tings targeting the LGBT com munity; and through word-of-
mouth, referrals, and snowball recr uitment within the LGBT comm unity.   
 
Snowball recruitment methods wil l involve askin g recruited part icipants to pass information 
about the study on to other intere sted LGBT cancer survivors an d/or their caregivers.  Due to the 
stigmatized nature of LGBT identities and cancer diagnoses, ste ps will be taken to ensure that 
recruited participan ts do not feel unduly coe rced to participat e in snowball recruitment and that 
the confidentiality of other LGBT  cancer survivors in the commu nity is maintained.  We will 
include verbiage in the consent form whereby [CONTACT_688376] s tudy.  Those who consent to 
contact [CONTACT_688377] m embers will be provided with RSRB  approved brochures to 
give to potentially elig ible community members.  Research staff  will follow up with these 
participants while study recr uitment is ongoing to see if they need additional brochures; if so, 
additional brochures will be ma iled to participants’ home addre sses. 
 
Interested potential particip ants who contact [CONTACT_688378] 
a letter and brochure and scr eened via phone by a member of the  study team. 
 
4.2.2 Caregiver Recruitment: A similar procedure will be followed for the caregiver; after b eing 
nominated by a survivor, the c aregiver will be told about the s tudy immediately (if the caregiver 
is present at a clinic visit or  with the cancer survivor during  telephone contact), or sent a letter 
from the study team explaining t he study and providing the opti on to opt out of future contact.  If 
the caregiver is wil ling to continue, the study team member wil l conduct screening.   
 
4.3 Screening : After a member of the treatme nt team has referred the potenti al participant, o r the potential 
participant has contact[CONTACT_171690] e research team, screening of poten tial study participants will be conducted either in 
person or over the phone by [CONTACT_447815] h staff trained to explain t he project, recruit, and s creen participants (see 
Telephone Script). Verbal consen t to conduct this screening wil l be obtained using the telephone script. 
Screening will focus on the cancer survivor’s eligibility, with  caregivers nominated by  [CONTACT_473588].  Individually 
identifiable information will  not be kept on potential particip ants who decline to participate in the study, though 
we will note gender and race/eth nicity for the purpose of monit oring our success in recruiting women and 
racial/ethnic minorities. 
 
Eligibility of the dyad will primarily be established using can cer survivors’ characteris tics.  After a member of 
the treatment team has referred the LGBT cancer survivor or the  survivor has contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] t he research team, the 
survivor will be screened for e ligibility either via telephone or face to face.  In both screening approaches, a 
trained staff member will ask s urvivors about: (1) cancer diagn osis and treatment, (2) identification as lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, or transgender, or pa rtnership with a same-sex r omantic partner, (3) medi cal contraindications to 
exercise, and (4) presence and ava ilability of a primary caregi ver.   
 
Following screening of the cancer survivor, a study team member  will ask for the survivor to nominate a 
caregiver.  Caregivers will then be screened either via telepho ne or face-to-face.  After t he caregiver has been 
contact[CONTACT_688379], or  if the caregiver initiates contact [CONTACT_9881], screening 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           will focus on assessing willingness to participate and ruling o ut medical contraindications to engaging in 
moderate walking and re sistance training. 
 
After completing screening of sur vivors and caregivers, a study  team member will schedule survivors and 
caregivers for an informed cons ent session at the PEAK Lab, or will offer the option for participants to 
complete an electronic consent form (e-consent).  If consent is  obtained in person, caregiv ers and survivors can 
attend this session either as a  dyad or as individuals; if cons ent is obtained electronically, caregivers and 
survivors will be sent individua l copi[INVESTIGATOR_1093] e-consent form (see section 4.4 below).  
 
After screening and establishing informed consent, but before t he baseline assessment, m edical eligibility for 
participants will be further veri fied by [CONTACT_688380] r’s and caregiver’s oncologist or primary care 
physician.  With the participants ’ verbal consent, a study team  member will fax a form indicating that the 
participant has no medical cont raindications to participating i n a moderate intensity exercise program or 
physical function assessment (see Appendix).  The physician (or  designee) will verify a nd sign this form.  The 
form will be returned to the st udy team before the baseline ass essment meeting. Alternately, the medical 
monitor will assess the participant to rule out medical contrai ndications to participating in a moderate intensity 
exercise program. 
 
After consenting and verification t hat there are no medical con traindications to participating in an exercise 
program or physical assessment fo r either participant, dyads wi ll be scheduled to retur n to the PEAK Lab for a 
baseline assessment and random ization to an intervention arm.   
 
4.4 Consent Process  
 
4.4.1 In-person consent: To ensure appropriate safety precautions when conducting in-per son study 
procedures, the process for c onducting in-person visits outline d in the Guidance for Human 
Subject Research will be follo wed. After recruitment and screen ing, a time is scheduled for 
survivor and caregiver to come t o the PEAK Lab to complete the consent form, either separately 
or together.  If they arrive toge ther, the study team member wa lks each individual through the 
consent form to ensure comprehe nsion.  Survivors and caregivers  are given the option to sign the 
consent form. The study team member is available to answer any questions the survivor or 
caregiver may have about any asp ect of the study prior to conse nting and throughout the entire 
study period.   
 
4.4.2    Electronic consent:  In lieu of the paper-based consent document, consent may occur  remotely 
using the RSRB-approved eConsen t document provided via REDCap. The study staff will screen 
for potential participants using t he above screening procedures  and initiate initial contact [INVESTIGATOR_685006], briefly describing the st udy and asking them to contact [CONTACT_688381]. If a potential partic ipant is interested, the stud y team will talk to the person on the 
phone and obtain verbal permission fro m the participant to send  an email or text message stating, 
“Because URMC can’t control the security of email or text messa ges once we send them, we 
need your permission to text o r email you. Do you want to recei ve a copy of the consent 
document and a link to the eCons ent via text or email?” Written  permission from the patient will 
be documented. We will then email or text a pdf version of the eConsent document for the 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           participant to read. We will then set up a phone call or Zoom m eeting (participant’s choice) to 
formally go over the consent document. During this phone or Zoo m meeting, we will provide a 
link to the REDCap eConsent docum ent as well as instructions on  how to access the eConsent—
we will use verification wit h a passcode based on known informa tion (e.g., the patient’s home 
zip code). No personal health inf ormation will be sent via any emails/texts. The eConsent 
documents may be viewed on computers, electronic tablets, or sm artphones. The pdf copy of the 
eConsent and the REDCap eConsent will have identical informatio n; it will be optional for the 
person to review the consent befo re the study team discusses it  with them. After a member of the 
study team reviews the consent doc ument with the participant ov er the phone or computer, they 
will have the opportunity to elect ronically sign the eConsent v ia REDCap. Signatures will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_688382] t ype in their name. The pers on obtaining consent will then add 
their name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a timestamp to t he study participant’s signed eC onsent form in REDCap. In order 
to authenticate the identity of the participant signing the eCo nsent, we will again ask the 
participant to use a passc ode based on known information (e.g.,  the participant’s year of birth) 
for verification. Once the eConsent form is signed and submitte d, the patient and/or legally 
authorized representative will  be able to print a paper copy, d ownload a pdf, and/or receive an 
email with a PDF attachment of t he signed consent form.  A simi lar process will also occur with 
the identified caregiver.  
 
4.4.3 After providing written or el ectronic informed consent, t he survivor and caregiver, with the help of 
the study team member, will complete a Physical Activity Readin ess Questionnaire (PAR-Q+), an 
On-Study Data Form, a Clinical R ecord Form and a Medication For m providing demographic and 
clinical data.  The study team member will obtain information n ecessary to complete these three 
forms from the survivor’s electr onic medical records when the s urvivor is unable to provide this 
information in sufficient deta il (e.g., staging, surgical proce dures, types and doses  of treatments).  
Information from the caregiver ’s physician will be used to comp lete these three forms when the 
caregiver is unable to provide i nformation in sufficient detail .

5. RANDOMIZATION 
 
 Survivors and their caregivers who meet the eligibility criteri a, sign the informed consent form and complete all 
baseline assessments will immediately be randomized as a dyad t o one of two trial arms by [CONTACT_3553] a 
computer-generated randomization table. 
 
5.1 A total enrollment of 70 can cer survivors and their 70 prim ary caregivers is planned (70 dyads total, 35 
dyads per trial arm). 
 
5.2 The two trial arms will be as follows: 
 
 Trial Arm            Condition  
 
1 Dyadic Exercise Intervention (EXCAP-PA):  Progressive walking and 
resistance exercise treatment, pr escribed to both cancer surviv ors and their 
caregivers (daily walking and up t o 7 times/week r esistance pre scription for 
6 weeks).  Cancer survivor and car egiver are als o asked to disc uss ways they 
can support one another in a) rema ining adherent to exercise, a nd b) dealing 
with stress, including LGBT- specific minority stress. 
 
2 Individual Exercise Intervention (EXCAP):  Progressive walking and 
resistance exercise treatment, pr escribed solely to cancer surv ivors (daily 
walking and up to 7 times/week res istance prescription for 6 we eks).  The 
caregiver is told not to change his/ her exercise behavior in an y way. 
 
 
  
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0            
 
6. METHODS AND STUDY PROCEDURES 
 
 
6.1 Objective : This will be a two-arm randomized controlled trial examining th e efficacy of a dyadic, 
partner-assisted home-based walki ng and progressive resistance exercise program (EXCAP-PA) vs. an 
individual, survivor-only home-b ased walking and progressive re sistance exercise program (EXCAP) 
for the relief of psychological d istress among LGBT cancer surv ivors. This is an ancillary cancer control 
intervention, administered for  control of psychological symptom s caused by [CONTACT_688383],  
caregiver stress, cancer, and/or cancer treatment. 
 
6.2 Recruitment and Screening : The study team will recruit and screen survivors prior to sched uling an 
initial visit to establish inform ed consent via several mechani sms, listed below. 
 
6.2.1 LGBT or same-sex partnered cancer survivors (any cancer t ype except squamous or basal cell 
skin cancers), finished with t reatment or on indefinite treatme nt, along with a caregiver (broadly 
defined and designated by [CONTACT_688384]), will be invited to par ticipate in the study.  
 
6.2.2 Potentially eligible LGBT can cer survivors will be contac ted through several channels: 
[IP_ADDRESS] By a letter from the st udy team and physician, after be ing identified and screened for 
eligibility through e -record or i2b2 
[IP_ADDRESS] Directly by a member of the s tudy team, after being int roduced by a physician or care 
team member at a URMC clinic   
[IP_ADDRESS] Through the University of Roc hester Medical Center “Cli nical Trials” website 
[IP_ADDRESS] Through advertisements posted in local newspapers (the Empty Closet, etc.) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Through flyers posted in locations in the community (co ffee shops, etc.) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Through the PEAK Lab Facebook page 
[IP_ADDRESS] Through brochures and tear-off  posters left at local or ganizations serving the LGBT 
community (the Out Alliance of the Genesee Valley, Trillium Hea lth, etc.) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Through advertisements posted on websites frequented by  [CONTACT_688385] (Craigslist Men Seekin g Men and Women Seeking Women, etc.) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Through word-of-mouth (s nowball recruitment) 
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_933819] s the physician, their designee, or 
another care team member and lets them know that a survivor may  be eligible for the study; 
alternately, the physician, their  designee, or a care team memb er may recommend a survivor as a 
good study candidate.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] After identifying a potentia lly eligible participant, t he physician or care team member 
introduces the study and a membe r of the study team to the surv ivor during a scheduled 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           clinic visit.  The member of the  study team describes the study .  If the survivor is willing 
to continue, the study team mem ber conducts screening.  The phy sician or care team 
member (or their designee) then s igns a form that states the su rvivor has no medical 
contraindications to par ticipating in the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Alternately, a letter fro m the study team and physician  is sent to the survivor’s home, 
explaining the study.  If the surv ivor is willing to continue, the study team member 
conducts screening.  The physician or care team member then sig ns a form that states the 
survivor has no medical contrai ndications to participating in t he study.   
 
6.2.4 A similar procedure will be f ollowed for the caregiver; a fter being nominated by a survivor, the 
caregiver will be sen t a letter from the study team, explaining  the study.  If the caregiver is 
willing to continue, the caregiver will be screened for eligibi lity. To establish medical eligibility, 
the caregiver’s primary care phys ician (or designee) will verif y and sign a form, created by [CONTACT_58860], indicating that the caregiver has no medical contra indications to partic ipating in the 
study.  Alternately, the medical m onitor will assess for medica l contraindications. 
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_933820] with the survivor or caregiver in person following refe rral by [CONTACT_688386]’s treatment 
team, the study team member continues by [CONTACT_688387].  In talking to the 
survivor, the study team member s creens for eligibility and con firms whether or not the survivor 
has a primary caregiver who ma y also be eligible  to participate  in the study.  In talking to the 
caregiver, the study team  member screens fo r eligibility.  Duri ng this discussion, the study team 
member uses the informed consent document as a guide, goes over  details of the study with 
potential participants eithe r in person or on the phone, and re cruits them to the study.

6.3.2    If participants prefer to c onsent to the study remotel y, an electronic consent will be provided to 
them; procedures for this were explained in section 4.4.2. 
 
6.3.2 After providing written or el ectronic informed consent, s urvivor and caregiver , with the help of the 
study team member, will complete a Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+), an On-
Study Data Form, a Clinical Record  Form and a Medication Form p roviding demographic and 
clinical data.  The study team member will obtain information n ecessary to complete these forms 
from the survivor’s electronic medical records when the survivo r is unable to provide this 
information in sufficient deta il (e.g., staging, surgical proce dures, types and doses of treatments).  
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           Information from the caregiver ’s physician will be used to comp lete these three forms when the 
caregiver is unable to provide i nformation in sufficient detail . 
 
 The study chair, study coordinato r, and Certified Exercise Phy siologistSM have received 
appropriate training, as well as password secured access to use  the University of [COMPANY_002]ster 
Medical Center’s electronic pa tient scheduling and clinical inf ormation systems to obtain medical 
information and appropriate source documentation for research f iles.   
 
6.3.3 During the consent meeting, a ll participants will be give n a pedometer (or a f itness tracker such 
as the FitBit) and an Actigraph to wear for approximately 4-7 c onsecutive days before the 
baseline assessment.  The pedomet er (or fitness tracker) and ac tigraph will be co llected at the 
baseline assessment and returne d to all participants for approx imately 4-[ADDRESS_933822] with survivor and car egiver approximately 7 days before  their scheduled baseline 
assessment to remind them to wear  their pedometers (or fitness trackers) and actigraphs. 
 
6.4 Baseline assessment  
 
6.4.1 All assessments will be done on all study participants (cancer survivors and their 
caregivers).   Survivors and caregivers can com plete assessments either as a  dyad or individually.  
The sequence of assessments will  be the same at baseline and po st-intervention. 
 
6.4.2 Blood draw.  At the baseline assessment (and a gain at the post-intervention assessment), blood 
sampling will be done to estimate hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymph ocytes, monocytes, and 
biological endpoints of interest (serum amyloid A, CRP, cortiso l, along with mRNA 
concentrations of these endpoi nts).  Blood draws can be conduct ed with cancer survivor and 
caregiver together or separat ely, on the same day as the baseli ne assessment or up to a week 
before the baseline assessment.  The consent form will include a section asking whether 
participants agree to have their samples biobanked for addition al, future analyses.  Participants 
will have the option to check ye s or no to having their samples  biobanked. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] All blood draws will occur in t he General Clinical Rese arch Center (GCRC).  Survivors 
and caregivers will report for the blood draw fasted (for a min imum of 8 hours) on the 
day of the scheduled blood draw s.  The blood will be drawn by l icensed phlebotomists 
and participants will be offered br eakfast/a snack after the bl ood draw.  The time of day 
will be noted, with future assessm ents at approximately the sam e time of day during post-
testing.  (Note. A total of tw o blood samples will be taken: on e at baseline and one post-
intervention.  These time points are relevant to assess the inf luence of the activity 
intervention on biological endpoint s, as well as the associatio n between these biological 
endpoints and distress at follow- up.)  If a cancer survivor is having blood drawn by a 
licensed phlebotomist as part of a  clinical procedure and prefe rs to have blood drawn for 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / [ADDRESS_933823] to arrange for the  blood draw to occur per protoco l. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] A total of approximately  34 ml of blood (around 2 table spoons) will be drawn at each 
time point (baseline and post-in tervention assessment).  The bl ood draws for estimation 
of biological endpoint levels wi ll use 2 red top tubes for seru m (10 ml each, 20 ml total).  
These tubes will be inverted 3- 4 times, allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room 
temperature, centrifuged f or 10 min at 1500 x g and then frozen  at -20c or -80c.  The 
blood draw for estimation of biomarker genomics will use 1 purp le top EDTA-heparin 
tube (10ml total).  This EDTA tube will be rocked [ADDRESS_933824]. Janelsins in the Department of Surgery. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood counts will be obtained either through the medica l record (for survivors) or by 
[CONTACT_688388] 1 purple top EDTA- heparin tube (approximatel y 4ml) and conducting 
standard CBC with differential pr ocedures (for caregivers and f or survivors when blood 
counts are not available in the medical record).

offered breakfast/a snack in the  PEAK Lab.  If participants arr ive together as a dyad, the cancer 
survivor will begin completing que stionnaires while the caregiv er completes physical function 
assessments.  If the survivor and c aregiver arrive separately, the survivor will complete 
questionnaires first, follo wed by [CONTACT_688389],  while the caregiver will complete 
physical function assessments first, and followed by [CONTACT_688390]. 
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_933826] primarily of quantitative 
(closed-ended) questions, and will employ the REDCap online sur vey system, licensed to the 
University of [COMPANY_002]ster. The R EDCap questionnaires will be code d by a member of the study 
team who has experience coding a nd creating questionnaires and with the methodology of 
REDCap questionnaire entry.  RED Cap questionnaire s will also be  extensively tested prior to 
recruitment of participants.  T he quality of psychological and behavioral data is enhanced through 
use of REDCap because data entry errors due to skip patterns ar e removed. All participants are 
given an ID code that will be use d when the final dataset is de -identified. This de -identified dataset 
will be downloaded from the REDCap server space onto a password  protected server.  REDCap 
uses encryption algorithms t o protect participant data. 
 
 All survivors and caregivers will be given a demographics and treatment measure, as well as 
measures of mood (Profile of Mood States, POMS ), depression (Patient He alth Questionnaire-9, 
PHQ-9 ), anxiety (State/Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI ), quality of life (Short Form Health Survey 
12, SF-12 ), support from their study partne r (Dyadic Adjustment Scale-7,  DAS-7 ; Dyadic Support 
Questionnaire, DSQ ; Social Provisions Scale, SPS), patient-reported health ( PROMIS  item 
banks), minority stress (Heteros exism and Identity Questionnair e), sleep and fatigue (Insomnia 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           Severity Index, ISI; Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory, MFSI ), interaction with their 
physician  (Personal Efficacy in Physician-Patient Interaction, PEPPI; the Human Connection, 
THC ; Stanford Self-Efficacy, SSE)  and physical activity (Aerobics C enter Longitudinal Physical 
Activity Questionnaire, ACLS ) to complete. 
 
6.4.5 Physical function assessments.  Additionally, participants will be evaluated on 1) body 
composition (bioelectrical impedance), 2) heart rate va riability, 3) muscular strength (Handgrip 
Dynamometry, isokinetic knee flex ion/ extension and shoulder di agonal), and 4) aerobic capacity 
([ADDRESS_933827]), in that  order.  All physiological fitness  testing will be administered according 
to the Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription (GETP) as outlined by [CONTACT_688391] (A CSM).  (See section 10.2 for addit ional details.)   
 
6.4.6 Data from pedometers (or f itness trackers) and actigraphs  will also be collecte d for analysis.  Data 
from pedometers will be used to i nform the walking prescription  of the exercise interventions.

exercise kit following the pos t-intervention assessment. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cancer survivors and caregiv ers in dyads randomized to Arm 1 (EXCAP-PA) will each 
receive a home-based walking and p rogressive resistance exercis e program to follow for a 
total duration of approximately 6 weeks.  These dyads will be i nstructed in ways to use the 
exercise kits together.  They will also meet briefly with a mem ber of the study team, who 
will guide them through a discussi on of barriers to exercise, w ays they can support one 
another in remaining adherent t o exercise, and ways of dealing with stress (including 
LGBT minority stress). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cancer survivors in dyads randomized to Arm 2 (survivor -only EXCAP) will receive a 
home-based walking and progressive  resistance exercise regimen to follow for a total 
duration of approximately [ADDRESS_933829], will not rece ive an exercise regimen to 
follow during the study period and will not discuss dyadic supp ort with the cancer survivor.

accordance with the guidelines f or exercise testing and prescri ption as set forth by [CONTACT_104632].   
 
6.5.2 The Home-Based Walking and Progressive Resistance Exercis e Program will follow the 
guidelines listed below. 
 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           [IP_ADDRESS] The Home-Based Walking Prescription will be based on a participant’s (i.e ., survivor’s or 
caregiver’s) baseline pedometer assessment.  Participants will be given a pedometer (or 
fitness tracker) and encouraged to increase their total steps w alked by a minimum of 5% 
a week during the 6-week interve ntion while maintaining a moder ate intensity.  [Note: 
Walking intensity will be mon itored via the Rating of Perceived  Exertion (RPE) Scale, 
which is a visual analog scale ranging from 1 = no exertion at all to 10 = very strong 
exertion.  Participants will be i nstructed to aim for an RPE of  5-8, consistent with other 
studies of EXCAP for cancer survivors.]  The upper threshold of  the walking prescription 
of the EXCAP program w ill be 12,000 steps per day. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] The Home-Based Progressive R esistance Prescription will  be based on a participant’s 
baseline isokinetic strength a ssessment.  Participants will be instructed on the proper use 
of resistance bands.  Participant s will then be instructed to c hoose a resistance band with 
which they can perform 8-12 r epetitions of 5 upper body resista nce exercises (bicep curl, 
tricep extension , chest press , rows, and overhead press) and 5  lower body resistance 
exercises (leg curl, leg exten sion, squat, toe raises, and side  bends), plus core 
strengthening exercis es.   Participants will be instructed to b egin with 1 set of 8-12 
repetitions at a moderate to c hallenging level (RPE 5-8), up to  7 times per week.  
Participants will be instructed t o progressively increase to 4 sets for each exercise 3 times 
per week.  (Note. Survivors and caregivers in Arm 1 will both b e instructed in the proper 
methods for performing each exercise as a dyad.  Cancer survivo rs in Arm 2 will be 
instructed in the proper methods  for performing each exercise i ndividually.) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Participants will be instructed in the proper methods f or performing each exercise by [CONTACT_688392].  For those randomized to the dyadic 
intervention, this will involve  a 45-[ADDRESS_933831] an d the survivor alone.

proper methods for performing each exercise to the dyad, a trai ned member of the study team 
will meet with participants.  This meeting will involve a discu ssion of barriers that might reduce 
adherence to the intervention for each participant, ways that c ancer survivor and caregiver can 
support one another in remaining a dherent, and ways of dealing with stress (including LGBT 
minority stress).  Those randomi zed to Arm 2, survivor-only EXC AP, will not discuss dyadic

9. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
 
 
9.1 Risks to participants:  There are four potential risks a ssociated with participation in  the proposed study:  
1) physical harm associated with  assessment procedures, 2) phys ical harm associated with intervention 
procedures, 3) emotional distre ss and 4) loss of confidentialit y.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_933839] are similar t o participation in a moderate to vigorous walking exercise program 
and are minimal for individuals  with no cardiopulmonary, orthop edic, or age identified risk 
factors as determined by a physicia n.  Risks include muscle cra mps, muscle stra in and/or joint 
injury, delayed muscle soreness,  lightheadedness, and fatigue.  Handgrip Dynamometry and 
Biodex isokinetic tests for stre ngth may cause minor stiffness and/or tenderness in muscles for a 
couple of days following testi ng.  The nature of these assessme nts will require a level of 
exertion; this exertion may cause  temporary changes such as an increase in heart rate and blood 
pressure, both of which are normal responses to vigorous exerci se.  There is a small risk of 
irritation to the skin from the electrodes used for the BIA ana lysis.   
 
9.1.2 In terms of physical harm asso ciated with intervention pr ocedures, commencement of a moderate 
walking and progressive resistanc e exercise program is not asso ciated with any severe side 
effects and risks are minimal f or individuals with no cardiopul monary, orthopedic, or age 
identified risk factors as d etermined by a physician.  The abso lute chance of a cardiac event 
among adults while engaging in vigo rous exercise is one per yea r for every 15,000 to 18,000 
people.59  A transient increase in blood pre ssure may occur with all types  of exercise.  Although 
unlikely, a moderate walking and pr ogressive resistance exercis e program may also cause 
musculoskeletal effects, such as mild muscle soreness, a muscle  strain, or other related accidental 
injuries such as trippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Overa ll, the risk level for partici pation in the moderate intensity 
EXCAP Home-Based Walking and Pr ogressive Resistance program is minimal. 
 
9.1.3 In terms of emotional distre ss, the quantitative assessme nts explore issues associated with the 
relationship between survivors and caregivers, feelings about t reatment, and mental health.  The 
sensitive nature of these items  may cause partic ipants to becom e distressed as they think about 
their responses.  Specific t o research with dyads, during the i ntervention or possibly as a result of 
responding to questionnaire items , issues may arise that could lead to tension between survivor 
and caregiver and possible conflic t and/or violence within the dyad.   
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_933840] risk:  Four potential risks have been a ssociated with participation in  this 
study: 1) physical harm associate d with assessment procedures, 2) physical harm associated with 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           intervention procedures, 3) emo tional distress and 4) loss of c onfidentiality.  
 
9.2.1 Physical harm associated w ith assessment and intervention  procedures:  Every effort will be 
made to minimize the risks asso ciated with study procedures for  all participants.  First, all 
participants (cancer survivors a nd caregivers) must have the ap proval of their physician to enter 
the study.  All testing and exerc ise prescription discussions w ill be supervised by [CONTACT_688396] (ACSM)  Certified Exercise Physiologi stSM. A physician (or 
physician’s designee) will be p resent when necessary according to ACSM Guidelines; for 
example, in circumstances where  the participants ’ physician has  approved the participant to 
participate in the study, but rev iew of a participant’s medical  history reveals cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
orthopedic, or central nervous system conditions that do not pr eclude participa tion in exercise 
but might increase the particip ant’s risk of complications duri ng fitness testing.  This 
conservative policy is designed t o ensure the safety and minimi ze the risk to cancer survivors.  
EXCAP uses standardized guideline s for exercise testing and pre scription provided by [CONTACT_688397], which have been shown to be s afe to use with medically il l populations.   
 
Risks will also be minimized by [CONTACT_688398] -funded and approved University of  [COMPANY_002]ster General Clinical 
Research Center (GCRC); their trained staff will perform these tests.  Specifically, to minimize 
the chance of bruising and the s light chance of infection assoc iated with blood collection, the 
GCRC employs standardized hosp ital procedures for blood collect ion, and uses a trained 
phlebotomist and sterile materials.   
 
Though the overall risks of partic ipating in a low to moderate intensity home-based exercise 
program are minimal, participan ts will be instructed to stop pe rforming the exercises if they 
experience cardiopulmonary sympt oms that may be indicative of a  more serious medical side-
effect.  An ACSM Certifie d Exercise PhysiologistSM will be available by [CONTACT_14223] e-mail to 
assist participants in problem  solving and performing exercises  in a safe fashion. 
 
9.2.2 Emotional distress: [CONTACT_688412] has over ten years of exper ience conducting assessments with 
persons undergoing both acute and chronic stress, including ind ividuals who report extensive 
trauma histories and are living with chronic illnesses, as well  as combat veterans and their 
spouses.  It is rare for a participant to find self-report ques tionnaires to be psychologically 
distressing, even when responding to items that have asked dire ctly about trauma exposure and 
trauma symptoms.  To prevent dis tress, participants will be inf ormed that they are free to decline 
to answer any question for any rea son; furthermore, these optio ns will be explicitly stated in the 
consent forms. Research staff will be extensively trained to he lp minimize distress to 
participants. However, should par ticipants become depressed, an xious, agitated, or otherwise 
distressed during the assessment , [CONTACT_688412] or another trained member of the research staff will 
be notified and the participant wi ll be triaged and referred fo r care.  Should the participant 
already be receiving care, they w ill be referred to follow up w ith their care provider and a check 
in call will be made following t he assessment to establish part icipant safety and comfort.  For 
concerns related to violence within the dyad detected during th e course of the study, we will take 
the following precautions. As stated above, [CONTACT_688412] will be a vailable at all times to provide 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / [ADDRESS_933841] referral information av ailable for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_688355].  
 
9.2.3 Confidentiality:  This stu dy involves collecting biologic al samples and obtaining access to 
medical records, and steps must  be taken to protect both partic ipant data and identity. The 
following confidentiality protecti on steps will be taken: 1) Re search staff will participate in 
initial training, follow-up t raining, and ongoing monitoring an d supervision to ensure 
understanding of the ethical issues  involved in this research; 2) only the research staff will know 
the name, identification (ID)  number, and contact [CONTACT_3031] o f participants. The list that links 
the participant’s name [CONTACT_4490] I D number will be kept on an encryp ted drive accessible only by [CONTACT_75275]; 3) consent form s will be kept in locked filing cabinets in a locked office, again 
accessible only by [CONTACT_3647]; and 4) any personal identifi ers linked to data will be removed 
and replaced by [CONTACT_105]-identifying ID numbers in all records. The electronic files that contain 
quantitative data will be sto red on a secure University of Roch ester Medical Center file server. 
These files will be password pr otected and accessible only by t he PI [INVESTIGATOR_115292].  
 
Due to the dyadic nature of t he proposed study, additional prec autions are necessary to avoid 
inadvertent transfer of confiden tial information from one partn er to another a s a result of 
participation in assessments.  Q uantitative assessments are con ducted separately with each 
partner so that it is not possibl e for research staff to reveal  information to one partner about the 
other partner.   
 
9.3 Benefits: There are no direct ben efits of the study t o the study particip ants. Potential s econdary benefits 
of the study include that all participants will receive an exer cise kit to keep at no charge. Caregivers in 
the individual intervention group w ill receive the kit and inst ructions after completing all of the study 
assessments.  Participants may or  may not receive any further b enefit from participating in this study.   
 
  
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / [ADDRESS_933842], general mood (the primary 
outcome ) will be assessed through the short form of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) .  The 
POMS consists of 30 adjectives i n 6 subscales (e.g., anxiety, d epression), which participants rate 
on a five-point scale with “1” = “ Not at all” and “5” = “Extrem ely” to describe their moods over 
the past week.  The POMS has bee n used extensively in research with cancer patients and has 
demonstrated reliability and validity.
60,61  
 
10.1.2 Second, depression will be assessed with the  Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).   The 
PHQ-[ADDRESS_933843] been tested in medical  populations.63  A total score of 10 
or higher will be defined as a de pressed case for analyses of p ossible subgroup changes in 
depression.64 If there is concern about the  degree of depression and/or poss ible risk of suicide 
based upon information from the PHQ-9, the participant will be referred to their physician and/or 
an appropriate source of  psychological care.   
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_933844], anxiety will be measured using the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_73593]/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI 
Form Y-1).   In order to reduce overall pa tient burden, we will use only t he state portion of the 
questionnaire.  This one-page, sel f-administered questionnaire consists of [ADDRESS_933845] to indicate th e degree to which they generally experienc e the particular feeling, ranging 
from 1 = “Not at all” to 4 = “Ver y much so” at that time.  It i s one of the most widely-used 
assessments of anxiety.  Internal consistency coefficients > 0. [ADDRESS_933846]/retest reliabili ty coefficients > 0.70.  Concurrent, const ruct, convergent and divergent 
validity have also been demonstrated.65,66 
10.1.4 Quality of Life (QOL) will be assessed with the Short Form Health Survey 12 (SF-12), a 12-
item, multi-purpose scale designed primarily to measure functio nal health and well-being in a 
parsimonious fashion.67  For the current study, mental and physical health summary sco res will 
be used to asses QOL.  Responses are  anchored using a Likert sc ale ranging from  1 to 5 (strongly 
agree, agree, neutral, disagree , and strongly disagree, respect ively).  Cronbach’s Alpha 
coefficients indicate  reliability of over .90.68,69 
10.1.5 Support between the patient and caregiver will be assess ed with three measures: the Dyadic 
Adjustment Scale-7; the Dyadic Support Questionnaire; and the S ocial Provisions Scale. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The Dyadic Adjustment Scale-7 (DAS-7) is a 7-item scale designed to measure how 
individuals feel about their re lationship with their caregivers  using a unidimensional 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           global approach.  Responses are anchored on a Likert scale rang ing from 1 to 5 (strongly 
agree, agree, neutral, disagree , and strongly disagree, respect ively).  Cronbach’s Alpha 
coefficients indicate an intern al consistency range from .[ADDRESS_933847] 
reliability range from .63 to .85 among cancer patients.70   
[IP_ADDRESS] The Dyadic Support Questionnaire (DSQ) is an 18-item survey based on four 
functions of social support (emo tional, appraisal, instrumental , and informational 
support).  Nine items measure rece ived social support, that is,  support provided by [CONTACT_47446]; nine additional items measure support provided to the partner.  Items are 
anchored using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 (from not at all to a great deal).  Items 
are summed to create scales f or received and provided support.  Cronbach's alpha 
reliability coefficients range  from .[ADDRESS_933848] rel iability coefficients range 
between .74 and .92 for this measure.71 
[IP_ADDRESS] The Social Provisions Scale – Short Form (SPS) is a 10-item survey designed to 
measure availability of emotiona l, tangible, and informational social support using a 
single general social support sc ale.  Items are anchored on a f our point Likert-type scale 
ranging from Strongly Disagree to  Strongly Agree.  Psychometric  properties for the 
measure are excellent, with Cronb ach's alpha reliability coeffi cients over .90.72,73  
10.1.6 Additional patient-reported health outcomes will be meas ured with several short item banks from 
the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measu rement Information System (PROMI S).  The 
PROMIS item banks were develope d by a National In stitutes of He alth (NIH) cooperative group 
and tested extensively on multiple waves of participants.  The item banks all display adequate 
reliability and excellent conve rgent validity with existing leg acy measures (e.g., the FACIT-F). 
The current study will include ite ms from the general health, a nxiety, and fatigue banks.74,75 
10.1.7 Sleep difficulties and fati gue will be assessed with two  measures: the Insomnia Severity Index 
and the Multidimensional Fa tigue Symptom Inventory.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Insomnia symptoms will be assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) , a 
commonly used, 7-item psychometrically reliable and valid measu re providing an 
insomnia total score and subscal e scores in cancer survivors.76,77 
[IP_ADDRESS] Fatigue will be assessed using the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory 
(MFSI) , a [ADDRESS_933849] of fatigue using f ive subscales: 
general fatigue, physical fatigue , mental fatigue, reduced acti vity, and reduced 
motivation.78,79 Though developed to measure can cer-related fatigue, the scale has been 
used with non-cancer populations; items are generic and could a pply to both patients and 
caregivers.80-82  The MFSI is both valid and reliab le, with Cronbach alphas for  subscales 
ranging from .71-.86.83 
10.1.8 LGBT-specific minority stress will be assessed with the Heterosexism and Identity 
Questionnaire , a 41 item measure with nine s ubscales assessing harassment, d iscrimination, 
acceptance, concealment, identity, and homonegativity.  The pri ncipal investigat or has used this 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           measure previously in studies of  same-sex relationships, and it  demonstrates acceptable 
reliability and validity.42 
10.1.9 Finally, patient-physician i nteraction will be measured with a battery of short  questionnaires: the 
Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions  (PEPPI) scale, the Stanford Self-
Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease Scale  (SSES) and The Human Connection  (THC) 
scale.  All three questionnaire s are rated on a L ikert-type sca le, measure multiple aspects of 
patient empowerment and communica tion in the context of medical  interaction, and have been 
used extensively in medical research.84-86  Psychometric properties for these scales are excellent 
and participant burden is minimal.85-87   
 
10.2 Physiological and Physical  Activity Measurements 
10.2.1 Physical Activity will be  assessed subjectively using th e Physical Activity Readiness 
Questionnaire (PAR-Q+), the Aer obic Center Longitudinal Study P hysical Activity 
Questionnaire and questions on the  daily journal.  In addition,  objective assessments of physical 
activity will be obtai ned via actigraphy, from the pedometer, a nd through heart rate  variability.  
[IP_ADDRESS] The Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+)  will be used following the 
consent process as an additional screen for medical contraindic ations to exercise.  The 
PAR-Q+ asks about a variety of  medical conditions and physical symptoms associated 
with contraindications to incre ased physical activity.  Reliabi lity (r=0.99) and sensitivity 
(0.90) are high when assessing hyperten sion and other risk fact ors for increased physical 
activity.88  In addition to the PAR-Q+, all pa rticipants will receive medi cal clearance 
from their physician (or the s tudy medical monitor, or designee s) to participate in the 
exercise intervention. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The Aerobic Center Longitudinal Stud y Physical Activity Questionnai re (ACLS)  is 
a measurement instrument that includes assessment of lifestyle physical activity.89  The 
questionnaire requests that partic ipants report their engagemen t in fourteen different 
physical activities (frequenc y, intensity and duration) over th e last three months.  
Estimates of energy expenditure a re calculated using the follow ing equation: 
(sessions/week) * (min/session)* (hour/min) * MET [Note: MET = metabolic energy 
expenditure rate] for each ac tivity and then summed to provide total MET hours of 
energy expenditure for a wee k.  The index of walking, jogging, and running predicted 
treadmill performance time (beta = .31) and there is a moderate  relationship between 
energy expenditure estimates and treadmill performance (r = .41 ).   
[IP_ADDRESS] The Daily Diary (as referenced e lsewhere in the protocol) is designed to track daily 
physical activity.  The participan t will be asked to complete t he journal each night 
immediately prior to sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a nd record steps walked, minutes of resistance training 
completed, and a Rating of Per ceived Exertion.  The daily diary  will also include an item 
assessing average daily distre ss, rated on a 0-10 scale.  All p articipants will complete this 
daily assessment of distress, but  only those randomized to the exercise condition will 
complete the exercise-relevant measures. 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           [IP_ADDRESS] Actigraphy , as an objective measure of phys ical activity, will involve th e waist-worn 
actigraph.  The actigraph provides calculated energy expenditur e values for Active 
Energy Expenditure (AEE) in kiloca lories and total energy expen diture in Metabolic 
Equivalents per Time (METs) i n kilocalories/min/kg.  The actigr aph features a variable 
epoch length which can be set between 1 to 240 seconds and 16 M B non-volatile 
memory.  “Non-volatile” means th at even if the battery, which c an log [ADDRESS_933850].  Software 
supplied by [CONTACT_688399] (day -7 to day 0, day 35  to day 42). 
[IP_ADDRESS] The Pedometer (or fitness tracker) will be us ed to assess duration of physica l activity 
via steps walked during the time out of bed.  Both pedometers a nd fitness trackers 
provide visual feedback of numb er of steps walked, and so can b e used in the same 
fashion.  The PEAK Lab is in the process of transitioning from standard pedometers to 
wearable fitness trackers. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Heart Rate Variability  (HRV) will be measured using t he Firstbeat® Bodyguard [ADDRESS_933851].  Five  biomarker outcomes will 
be assessed. Two time domain s will be assessed including SDNN (the standard deviation 
of all normal R-R intervals meas ured between consecutive sinus beats) and RMSSD (the 
root mean square of successive di fferences between adjacent nor mal R-R intervals). 
Three frequency domains will be assessed including RSA (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_688356]), LF (natural log of low frequency, tot al spectrum pow er of all NN i ntervals 
between 0.04 to 0.15Hz), and LF/HF ratio (the ratio of Low Freque ncy Total Spectrum 
Power of all NN Intervals Between .04 to .15 Hertz to High Freq uency Total Spectrum 
Power of all NN Interval s between .15 to .40 Hertz). 
10.2.[ADDRESS_933852], the total  distance walked is used to ca lculate an estimate of aerobic 
capacity (VO 2max; Maximal Oxygen Consumption) . A physician (or physician’s d esignee) is 
available onsite in the hosp ital during testing of patients dee med high risk by [CONTACT_688400], as outlined by [CONTACT_688401].   
10.2.3 Muscular fitness will be assessed using two measures: a handgrip dynamometer test and an 
isokinetic muscular strength test.   
[IP_ADDRESS] The  Handgrip Dynamometer Test  is a grip strength test  used to assess the maximal 
voluntary contraction generated by [CONTACT_587692].  The test i s administered with the 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           patient standing with the elbow j oint angle held constant at 18 0 degrees and the medial 
distal humeral epi[INVESTIGATOR_681323] 2 inc hes from the torso.  Trials will be performed in an 
alternating bilate ral sequence, for a tot al of six attempts (th ree with each arm).  The best 
score of the three trials will be  used for right and left limbs  to calculate static strength.   
[IP_ADDRESS] The standard Isokinetic Muscular Strength Testing Protocol will use the Biodex 
System 4 Pro, a multi-mode computerized isokinetic dynamometer.   Muscular strength 
testing will involve isokinetic kn ee flexion/extension (lower b ody) and shoulder diagonal 
(upper body) movements.  A certif ied ACSM Exercise Physiologist  will provide a full 
orientation to the isokinetic m achine including: aligning subje ct into position, setting 
range of motion, and conducting a warm up set. The Physiologist  will be on hand 
throughout the test to ensure proper form and participant comfo rt.  After the warm up set, 
participants will complete a s ingle set of 10 repetitions of ea ch movement (isokinetic 
knee flexion/extension and shoulde r diagonal) per side. Partici pants will exert maximal 
force through their entire ra nge of motion, moving at a set spe ed in degrees per second 
against the lever arm.  Partici pants will also rest for approxi mately one minute between 
sets.  This isokinetic protocol w ill allow us to measure peak t orque, maximal work, total 
work, and average power for each movement. The Biodex System Pr o [ADDRESS_933853] (see section 9.1.1 and 9.2.1); this prot ocol uses a single set of 
repetitions per movement, however , to minimize the risk of fati gue. 
For participants who are unable to  complete the Isokinetic Musc ular Strength Testing 
Protocol, a standard 7-10 Repetition Maximum Dynamic  Strength Testing Protocol 
will be used  to estimate patients’ 1-repetiti on maximums for the leg extensi on 
(quadriceps) and bench press (pect oralis and deltoid). The pati ents will receive a full 
orientation to the fixed resista nce machines and proper lifting  form by a certified (e.g., 
ACSM) certified professional.  Par ticipants will perform a ligh t warm up consisting of [ADDRESS_933854] breaks (2-3 
minutes) and lifting bouts will con tinue with the resistance we ight being adjusted by [CONTACT_688402] a level of res istance that results in 
subjective fatigue between 7-10 r epetitions.   Established algo rithms employing the 
weight lifted and the number of r epetitions completed will then  be used to estimate the 
patients’ 1-repetition maximum.91  
10.2.4 Skeletal muscle mass will be assessed using bioelectrica l impedance.   
[IP_ADDRESS] The RJL Bioelectrical Impedance System  is a non-invasive, easy-to-administer and 
safe method of assessing lean body ma ss.  BIA involves passing a small electrical current 
through the body and evaluating the  reactance and r esistance to  flow, which are related to 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           fat-free mass (FFM) and total  body water.  Prediction of lean b ody mass from BIA is as 
reliable as skin-fold measurements and hydrostatic weighing.  P articipants lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_72301] a 
flat surface for approximately [ADDRESS_933855], to ensure a resting metabolic 
state.  Electrodes are attache d to the right hand (distal end o f the 3rd and 4th metacarpal 
and distal end of the ulnar and r adius), and the right foot (di stal end of the 3rd and 4th 
metatarsal and distal end of the  tibia and fibula).  Skeletal m uscle mass will then be 
calculated from the lean body mass.92  
 
10.3 Serum Analysis  
 
10.3.1 All blood draws and serum analyses will be done on all s tudy participants (cancer survivors and 
their caregivers).  A total of  approximately 34 ml of blood (ar ound 2 tablespoons) will be drawn 
at each time point (baseline and post-intervention assessment).   As stated above in sections 6.4.[ADDRESS_933856] CBC with d ifferential procedures.  These 
counts will be collected by [CONTACT_688403]’s research file.  The blood 
sample (approximately 4 ml) f or blood counts will be drawn in 1  purple-top (EDTA heparin 
plasma) vacutainer by [CONTACT_688404] l Research Center.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Because this is a research and not a clinical care pro tocol, the CBC is collected only to 
inform assessment of biological e ndpoints.  No clinical care re commendations will be 
offered to participants on the ba sis of their CBC.  Should any question about the CBC 
arise, participants w ill be directed to speak with their medica l provider. 
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_933857]. Janelsins’ Cancer Control and 
Psychoneuroimmunology Laboratory in t he Department of Surgery.  Samples will be stored in 
freezers owned and maintained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Janelsins.  Serum cortisol , serum amyloid A, and C-
reactive protein will be measur ed by [CONTACT_688405].  In flammatory biomarkers will be 
measured using multiplex assays.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] As stated above in secti on 6.4.1, the blood draws for estimation of biological endpoint 
levels will use 2 red top tubes for serum (10 ml each, 20 ml to tal).  These tubes will be 
inverted 3-4 times, allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room temp erature, centrifuged for 10 
min at 1500 x g and then frozen at -20c or -80c.  The blood dra w for estimation of 
biomarker genomics (i.e., mRNA c oncentrations related to produc tion of cortisol, serum 
amyloid A, and CRP) will use 1 pur ple top EDTA-heparin tube (10 ml total).  This EDTA 
tube will be rocked 10 times, s tored upright for minimum of 2 h ours at room temperature 
and then frozen at -20c or - 80c. All tubes will be drawn by [CONTACT_688406] (GCRC), processed by a technic ian in the GCRC, 
collected by a study team member a nd then transferred to lab sp ace maintained by [INVESTIGATOR_124].

13. DATA ANALYSIS AND DATA MONITORING 
 
 
13.1 Measures for the primary a nd secondary aims will be: 
 
13.1.1 Cancer survivor’s self-report ed psychological distress ( 30 item POMS Total Score) at post-
intervention (Primary Aim 1) 
13.1.2 Cancer survivor’s serum level s of stress-related biologi cal endpoints (cortisol, serum amyloid A, 
C-reactive protein) at post-i ntervention (Secondary Aim 2) 
13.1.3 Cancer survivor’s received su pport from the caregiver (D yadic Support Questionnaire) at post-
intervention (Secondary Aim 3)  
13.1.4 Cancer survivor’s physical activity, as measured by [CONTACT_688410], at post-inter vention (Secondary 
Aim 3)  
 
13.2 Measures for the explorator y aim in caregivers will be: 
 
13.2.1 Caregiver’s self-reported ps ychological distress (30 ite m POMS Total Score) at post-intervention  
13.2.2 Caregiver’s serum levels of  stress-relate d biological en dpoints (cortisol, ser um amyloid A, C-
reactive protein) at post-intervention 
13.2.3 Caregiver’s received support from the cancer survivor (D yadic Support Questionnaire) at post-
intervention  
13.2.4 Caregiver’s physical activit y, as measured by [CONTACT_55629] , at post-intervention  
 13.3 Data Analysis  
 
13.3.1 The primary outcome measure fo r this study is the cancer  survivor’s self-reported psychological 
distress, as assessed by [CONTACT_941] 30 item Profile of Mood States (PO MS) Total score at the post-
intervention time point (~6 weeks after baseline). The primary analyses will involve a 
comparison of EXCAP-PA relative to survivor-only EXCAP©® using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA).  This procedure assesse s the statistical significance  of the difference in post-
intervention mean between the tw o arms, controlling for baselin e score and using intent to treat 
analyses with 30 evaluable survivors per arm.  The comparison o f EXCAP-PA to survivor-only 
EXCAP©® assumes a null hypothesis of no difference, using a two-sided alpha.  We will use 
ordinary least-squares estimati on and F-tests for testing the f ixed effects.  Primary aim analyses 
will treat the LGBT cancer survi vor as the unit of analysis.  T he mean difference between groups 
with associated 95% confidence in tervals will be estimated usin g the appropriate contrasts.  This 
study will establish initial efficacy of the dyadic interventio n and provide an initial effect size for 
the intervention that will inform the development of a larger P hase III trial.  
 
13.3.[ADDRESS_933864] ress-related biological 
endpoints (serum amyloid A, CRP , cortisol) via ELISAs. The effi cacy of EXCAP-PA relative to 
survivor-only EXCAP©® in improving markers of HPA axi s functioning (cortisol) and ea rly 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0           inflammation (SAA, CRP) will be a ssessed using three separate A NCOVAs, each controlling for 
baseline biological marker valu es, and two ANCOVAs for dyadic s upport and intervention 
adherence.  Since the secondar y aims, relating to immune biomar kers of distress and provision of 
support within the dyad, are inte nded to gather preliminary eff icacy data for the development of 
a larger grant submission, the secondary analyses will also exa mine mean change scores (i.e., 
baseline assessment subtracte d from the post-intervention asses sment), standard deviations, and 
correlations on these variable s for the two study arms.  
 
13.3.[ADDRESS_933865] 
(distress and biological endpoint s) and potential mechanistic f actors (social support from a 
caregiver, adherence to the exerc ise interventi on).  Using the analysis techniques of Imai, I will 
evaluate whether change in soc ial support and change in interve ntion adherence are associated 
with the effect of the interve ntion on psychological distress a nd biological endpoints linked with 
distress. This will involve generating a correlation matrix to test bivariate relationships.  We will 
then conduct separate analyses for support and adherence with e ach outcome, using mixed 
effects ANCOVA models with arm, ba seline distress or biomarker score, with/without support 
and adherence pre-post change scores as model predictor terms. We will also evaluate change in 
caregiver distress sc ores from baseline t o post-intervention in  the EXCAP-PA condition using 
paired sample t-tests, to examine whether caregivers benefit fr om supporting LGBT cancer 
survivors.  We will also examine outcomes in L, G, B, and T sub groups and evaluate 
confounding and moderating factors.  Because of the many explor atory analyses involved, any 
results will only be used f or hypothesis generation. 
 
13.3.3 Additional analyses will examine between group differenc es in the other outcome measures.  
These will include:  physical activ ity (ACLS, Daily Diaries), a erobic capacity ([ADDRESS_933866]), muscular strength (handgr ip dynamometry, isokinetic stre ngth test), depression (CES-D), 
anxiety (STAI), minority stress (Heterosexism and Identity Scal e), relationship satisfaction 
(DAS-7), and quality of life (SF-12). 
 
13.[ADDRESS_933867] to 
retain 85% of the sample over th e short [ADDRESS_933868]-intervention.  This 
estimate is conservative, as a  previous study of LGBT patients and partners retained 93% of a 
sample of [ADDRESS_933869]. Kamen retained 100%  of participants in his 
feasibility trial.  With 85% ret ention, recruitment of [ADDRESS_933870] a sample of 60 survivors (a nd 60 caregivers) at the post-i ntervention assessment. 
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_933871] his or her data removed from the study .  If a survivor or caregiver 
withdraws or is removed from t he study following the baseline a ssessment, his/her partner may 
continue in the study. 
   
Protocol date :  7 / 0 6 / 2 0 2 0            
13.4.2  Every effort will be made to encourage and facilitate p rovision of questionnaire and biological 
data.  In the event of missing da ta, we will use intent-to-trea t analyses and evaluate missing at 
random and missing not-at-random assumptions (MAR/MNAR) to dete rmine the impact on 
results. We anticipate using multiple imputation if data are MA R and pattern-mixture models if 
data are MNAR.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_933872]-treatment assessment .  Based on previous research o n EXCAP©® that we have 
conducted, and assuming a SD of 13.[ADDRESS_933873] 80% power to detect difference of 6.90 (a 
moderate effect size of 0.58) bet ween the two gro ups at the 0.[ADDRESS_933874] treatment on the POMS total sc ore should the proposed study 
yield smaller mean differences.

 Intervention Protocols 
 
Description of Standardized EXCAP©® Intervention Clinical Protocol Components 
 
As noted above, each study participant r andomized to either the EXCAP-PA or the EXCAP©® 
condition is provided with an EXCAP©® Exercise Kit, which includes a pedometer, resistance 
bands, two assist strap handles, a written manual, and a carrying bag.   
 
The EXCAP©®  program was designed by [CONTACT_688411] e Scientist cer tified by [CONTACT_688391] (ACSM)  and is in accordance with the  guidelines for exercise testing 
and prescription as set forth by t he ACSM.  The prescription is  also guided by [CONTACT_941] “ACSM 
Exercise Guidelines for Can cer Patients and Survivors.”   
 The EXCAP
©® Walking Prescription will be ba sed on a patient’s baseline pedo meter assessment.  
Patients will be encouraged to inc rease their total steps walke d each day by a minimum of 5% 
and a maximum of 20% each week, w hile maintaining a moderate in tensity, during the 8-week 
intervention period.  Patients wi ll also be encouraged to conti nue increasing their steps and 
walking during the [ADDRESS_933884]-intervention.  [Note: Walking intensity will be monitored via 
the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale, which is a visual  analog scale ra nging from 1 = no 
exertion to 10 = very strong exert ion; this is part of the dail y diary that participants will keep.] 
 The EXCAP
©® Progressive Resistance Prescr iption will be based on a patient’ s optimal level of 
challenge.  Patients will be ins tructed on the proper use of re sistance bands.  Patients will then be 
instructed to choose a resistan ce band with which they can perf orm 8-12 repetitions of 5 upper 
body resistance exercises and 5 l ower body resistance exercises  listed below.  Patients will be 
instructed to begin with 1 set of  8-25 repetitions at a moderat ely challenging level (RPE 5-8) 
three days a week.  Patients will be instructed to progressivel y increase to a minimum of 3 and a 
maximum of 4 sets for each exercise up to seven times per week.   (Note. Patients will be 
instructed in the proper methods  for performing each exercise).  
 The program consists of an initi al 45-[ADDRESS_933885].  
Participants will be shown the pr oper methods for performing th e exercises and given a 
prescription for both walking and pr ogressive resistance.  A me mber of the study team will then 
follow up with weekly phone calls t o the participants to check in on their progress, answer any 
questions, troubleshoot barriers a nd encourage patients to adhe re to the exercise prescription.  
Our previous study provided the  intervention over 4-6 weeks wit h excellent adherence and no 
adverse incidents.    Caregivers randomized t o the survivor-only EXCAP
©® condition will be instr ucted not to change 
their exercise behavior in any way.  A detailed list of the EXCAP
©® exercises is provided below.

 Description of the EXCAP-PA Dy adic Framework Components 
 As noted above, survivors and caregivers r andomized to the EXCAP-PA intervention arm will 
each receive EXCAP©® materials and be instructed in their use together.   
 
The EXCAP-PA dyadic framework w as developed by a clinical psych ologist ([CONTACT_688412]) with a 
training background in dyadic behavi oral interventions.  This f ramework uses clinical skills from 
other dyadic interventions to t rain caregivers of LGBT cancer s urvivors in motivational 
strategies that can be used to help  survivors adhere to the exe rcise program. 
 The program’s three components are discussion of LGBT specific stress , assessment of 
barriers , and elicitation of supportive behaviors . 
 In discussing LGBT specific stress , the interventionist asks th e LGBT cancer survivor open 
ended questions about experiences  as a sexual minority individu al seeking cancer care.  The 
LGBT survivor will guide the di scussion, but the interventionis t may ask about how being a 
sexual minority affected relati onships with care providers, unm et needs that arose during care, 
and how identity shapes experience of survivorship.  The caregi ver will then be asked to 
contribute any of their experien ces in providing care for the L GBT survivor.  Exercise is 
introduced in this context as a  way the dyad can support one an other, even in the stress of cancer 
or the stress of being a sexua l minority seeking cancer care. 
 In assessing barriers , the interventionist asks both pa rticipants about the barriers  that might 
interfere with their ability t o exercise over the next week.  B arriers could include daily 
obligations, physical concerns or  symptoms, or emotional or mot ivational concerns.  Both LGBT 
survivor and caregiver share t heir anticipated barriers with on e another and with the 
interventionist.  In behavioral activation resear ch, assessing barriers to accomp lishing a behavioral goal is a well-
validated method of ensuring goal completion.
93,94  The same technique is  used in Motivational 
Interviewing, to elicit “change t alk” and increase motivation t o engage in the behavioral 
change.95-[ADDRESS_933886] helpful.  A final check wit h the LGBT survivor sets the co llaborative goal and expectation 
for the week.  Supportive behavior exchange i s a common technique in many dyad ic interventions.
98-100  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_688360] d behaviors from each member 
 
 of the dyad on a weekly basis; how ever, in situations where one  member of the dyad is a patient 
and the other a caregiver, suppor tive behaviors may be specific ally directed at the patient from 
the caregiver.101,[ADDRESS_933887] week’s goal, establish a new goal for the week, and establ ish supportive behaviors that the 
caregiver will use.  In the survivor-only  EXCAP
©® condition, calls will be made to the LGBT cancer survivor alon e 
and will involve troubleshooting and setting a goal for the nex t week, without the dyadic support 
component.

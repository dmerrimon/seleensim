AirSeal ® /CO2 absorption study protocol  
  
ABSTRACT   
Three main factors affect patients’ cardiopulmonary status during gynecologic laparoscopy: 1) degree of 
Trendelenburg tilt (25 – 30°), 2) CO2 absorption and 3) increased intra -abdominal pressure  (10 –20 mmHg). Slight 
modifications to any or all of these three factors can lead to a significant decrease in morbidity.  
  
The AirSeal® valveless trocar system reduces CO2 absorption when compared to standard trocars during renal 
laparoscopy. [ADDRESS_89178] trocars, a feature that could possibly allow for laparoscopic surgery to be performed at lower intra - 
abdominal pressures.2 We hypothesize that with the AirSe al® valveless trocar system, gynecologic laparoscopy 
can be performed at a lower intra -abdominal pressure with a possible resultant decrease in CO2 absorption, 
while maintaining adequate visualization of the operative field for safe completion of surgery.  
  
The purpose of this study is to compare CO2 absorption during gynecologic laparoscopy using the AirSeal® 
valveless trocar system versus standard insufflation trocars at intra -abdominal pressures of 10 and 15 mmHg.

V3 [ADDRESS_89179] a patient’s cardiopulmonary status during the procedure.  
  
Three main factors affect patients’ cardiopulmonary status during gynecologic laparoscopy.   
During standard gynecologic laparoscopy, a 25 -30° Trendelenburg tilt is needed  to visualize the pelvic anatomy. 
In addition, an intra -abdominal pressure (IAP) of 10 to 20 mmHg is maintained with a continuous infusion of CO2 
at a flow rate of 40L/min. The Trendelenburg tilt causes cardiovascular and gas exchange impairments that are 
exaggerated by [CONTACT_81938]2 pneumoperitoneum.[ADDRESS_89180] the anesthesiologists’ ability to ventilate the 
patient and maintain adequate end -tidal CO2 (ETCO2). Furthermore, CO2 which is the most commonly used gas 
for laparoscopy is absorbed transperit oneally and this absorption combined with hypercapnia and 
hypoventilation can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and even cardiac arrest.[ADDRESS_89181] demonstrated 
increased systemic absorption of CO2 gas during transperitoneal and retroperitoneal lapar oscopy by [CONTACT_81939]-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) and CO2 elimination rates.5,[ADDRESS_89182] been explored including gasless and/or low -pressure pneumoperitone um, and use of alternate gases 
(nitrous oxide, argon, helium) for insufflation; all with varying degrees of success. 7,8,9,10,11  
  
The AirSeal® valveless trocar system has the potential to minimize patient complications by [CONTACT_81940]2 gas.   
The AirSeal® valveless trocar system was designed to provide “stable pneumoperitoneum at a CO2 flow rate of 
3L/min, continuous smoke evacuation and valve free access to the abdominal cavity”12. Use of this system is also 
associated with a decr ease in CO2 use, absorption and elimination when compared to standard trocars.1 This 
reduction in CO2 absorption potentially makes the AirSeal ® trocar system a more attractive alternative to 
standard insufflation. However to date, no randomized clinical t rials have been performed to demonstrate 
clinically or statistically significant benefits of the AirSeal® trocar system until now.  
  
The AirSeal® valveless trocar system has the potential to minimize patient complications by [CONTACT_81941] - 
abdomina l pressure needed to safely complete a laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.   
There is scant evidence regarding the effect of low -pressure pneumoperitoneum on cardiopulmonary function 
during gynecologic laparoscopy. An increased intra -abdominal pressure during  laparoscopic surgery reduces lung 
volume, increases peak airway pressure and decreases pulmonary compliance. In addition, this elevated pressure 
reduces diaphragmatic excursion and shifts the diaphragm cephalad, collapsing smaller airways and causing 
intraoperative atelectasis, which in turn decreases functional residual capacity.[ADDRESS_89183] pressure pneumoperitoneum but showed comparable end tida l CO2, pCO2, oxygen 
saturation, pO2 and blood gas analyses.15 However, only one study in this review involved pelvic surgery and so 
the generalizability of these conclusions to gynecology is limited.  
  
  
AirSeal ® /CO2 absorption study protocol  
Use of the AirSeal® trocar system provides a more stable intra -abdominal pressure when compared to standard 
trocars; a feature that could possibly allow for laparoscopic surgery to be performed at lower intra -abdominal 
pressures. We hypothesize that with the AirSeal® valveless trocar system, gynecologic l aparoscopy can be 
performed at a lower intra -abdominal pressure with a possible resultant decrease in CO2 absorption, while 
maintaining adequate visualization of the operative field for safe completion of surgery. The purpose of this 
study

is to compare CO2 absorption during gynecologic laparoscopy using the AirSeal® valveless trocar system versus 
standard insufflation trocars at intra -abdominal pressures of 10 and 15 mmHg.

valveless trocar system versus standard insufflation trocars at intra -abdominal pressures of 10 and  
15mmHg  
  
2.2.2 Secondary objectives:   
a) To evaluate the anesthesiologists’ perception of difficulty in maintaining adequate ETCO2 during 
laparoscopy using the AirSeal® valveless trocar system versus standard insufflation trocars at intra -

b) To evaluate the surgeon’s visualization of the operative field during laparoscopy using the 
AirSeal® valveless trocar system versus stan dard insufflation trocars at intra -abdominal pressures of 10

2.3 Aims & Hypotheses   
  
2.3a Specific Aim 1

V3 022417  
  
2.3b Specific Aim 2   
To determine if the anesthesiologists’ perception of difficulty in maintaining adequate ETCO2 during gynecologic 
laparoscopy as measured on a 3 -point l ikert scale differs using the AirSeal® valveless trocar system versus 
standard insufflation trocars at intra -abdominal pressures of 10 and 15mmHg  
  
2.3b.1 Hypothesis 2   
Maintaining adequate ETCO2 is less challenging when using the AirSeal® valveless trocar system versus 
standard insufflation trocars for gynecologic laparoscopy at intra -abdominal pressures of 10 and 15 
mmHg  
2.3c Specific Aim 3   
To determine if the surgeon’s visualization of the operative field during gynecologic laparoscopy as measured on 
a visual analog scale (VAS) differs when using the AirSeal® valveless trocar system versus standard insufflation 
trocars at intra -abdominal pressures of 10 and 15 mmHg  
  
2.3c.1 Hypothesis 3   
Visualization of the operative field is improved when using the AirSeal® valveless trocar system versus 
standard insufflation trocars for gynecologic laparoscopy at intra -abdominal pressures of [ADDRESS_89184] -operative shoulder pain as measured on a VAS pain s cale differs following gynecologic 
laparoscopy using the AirSeal® valveless trocar system versus standard insufflation trocars at intra -abdominal 
pressures of [ADDRESS_89185] -operative shoulder pain is improved following gynecol ogic laparoscopy using the AirSeal® valveless 
trocar system versus standard insufflation trocars at intra -abdominal pressures of [ADDRESS_89186] of two indepe ndent factors: 1. Type of trocar system 
(AirSeal® trocar vs. standard trocars) 2. Intra -abdominal pressure (IAP: 10 vs. 15 mmHg) on the dependent factor: 
CO2 absorption. This will result in four (4) study arms. CO2 absorption in each arm will be compared a t 15 and 60 
minutes.  
  
Justification of sample size: An effect size of 0.46 was calculated based on average CO2 absorption rates in a study 
comparing CO2 absorption when using the AirSeal® trocar versus standard trocars for laparoscopic renal surgery.[ADDRESS_89187] size of 0.46 or greater, with 80% power and a two -tailed 
alpha of 0.01. In order to allow for a possible 10% drop out, 132 patients will be enrolled in the study.  
  
CO2 absorption calculation:   
CO2 eli mination rate = CO23 absorption rate in order to keep patient metabolically constant.

General Analyses   
  
Continuous variables will be summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges. If normally 
distributed, they will be analyzed using parametric tests such as T -test and analysis of variance. To find

Categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies and percentages and analyzed with logistic regression 
or categorical response models.  
  
95% confidence intervals will be provided for descriptive statistics, as warranted.  
  
Subject characteristics are assumed to be comparable at the start of the study (randomization design) and so no 
formal statistical group comparisons will be conducted on the subject characteristics.  
  
An overall alpha -level of 0.01 will be used as a cut -point for statistical significance and all statistical tests will be 
two-sided. All data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_81943].

V3 [ADDRESS_89190] eted as detailed in the ‘Informed Consent Process’ section.  
  
8.0 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS   
After the provider determines eligibility of study participants, the informed consent process will be completed in 
2 possible ways as listed/explained below by [CONTACT_32816] [INVESTIGATOR_81935] (Co -investigator or other delegated study 
staff):  
  
Option 1:  
  
./  Patient will be offered participation in the study at their pre -operative visit  
./  During this visit, the informed consent and HIPAA form will be explained and all questions answered  
./  The provider will inform the patient that participation in the study will be contingent on availability of the 
medical device on the day of the procedure  
./  The informed consent and HIPAA form will be signed by [CONTACT_5363] a copy given to them for their 
personal records  
./  The original ‘wet -ink’ signed consent and HIPAA form will be stored in the patient’s chart  
./  On the procedure day, when the patient is in the pre -operative area, availability of the medical device 
will be confirmed and then the patient will be randomized into 1 of 4 groups  
./  Patients who are consented but not randomized will not be considered ‘drop outs’  
  
  
Option 2:  
  
./  At the time of the pre -operative visit, if time does not permit for consent to be obtained, the provider 
will obtain permission from the patient to allow a member of research team contact [CONTACT_81945] – if the provider is not a Co -I in the study, he/she will document permission for 
the re search team to contact [CONTACT_423]  
./  The patient will be given a copy of the informed consent and HIPAA form with their pre -operative packet 
and asked to review it in anticipation of a call (if they have agreed to this).  
./  A member of the research team will contact [CONTACT_81946]  
./  Patient will be informed that participation in study will be contingent on availability of the medical 
device on the day of the procedure  
./  At th e end of the phone conversation patient consent (or denial of consent) will be obtained and 
documented in patient’s chart  
./  If the patient consents to participate by [CONTACT_756], their signature [CONTACT_81949]  
./  A copy of the signed form will be given to the patient and the original ‘wet -ink’ copy will be stored in the 
patient’s chart  
./  When availability of the medical device is confirmed the patient will be randomized into 1 of 4 groups  
./  Patients who are consented but not randomized will not be considered ‘drop outs’  
  
With both options of the informed consent process, when participation is offered to the patient, the informed 
consent and HIPAA form will be explained in detail along with  the study design, procedures, inclusion/exclusion

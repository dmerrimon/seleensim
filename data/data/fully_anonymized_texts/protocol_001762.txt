Study Number: MLN0002 -3026 Phase: 3b
Study Design:
This is a phase 3b randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, multicenter, active -controlled study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of vedolizumab compared to adalimumab over a 52 -week treatment period followed by 18 -week 
follow -up period. The study will be conducted globally and will include 658 subjects with moderately to severely 
active ulcerative colitis (UC). 
On Day  1, subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and who meet none of the exclusion criteria wil l be randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to double -blind medication for 50 weeks. Subjects in the vedolizumab treatment group will 
receive a 300 mg intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 and Weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46, as well as placebo 
subcutaneous (SC) injection on Day 1, Week 2, and once every 2 weeks (Q2W) thereafter until Week 50. 
Subjects in the adalimumab treatment group will receive a 160 mg SC injection on Day 1 (four 40 mg injections in one 
day or two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at Week 2 (two 40 mg injections in one day), 
then 40 mg Q2W thereafter until Week 50, as well as a placebo IV infusion at Day 1 and Weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 
and 46. Subjects who do not respond to treatment based on the investigator’s discretion should be withdrawn and 
treated according to standard of care. 
Primary Objectives:
To determine the effectof vedolizumab IV compared to adalimumab SC on clinical remission at Week 52.
Secondary Objectives:
To evaluate the effect of vedolizumab IV compared to adalimumab SC on mucosal healing at Week 52.
To evaluate the effect of vedolizumab IV compared to adalimumab SCon corticosteroid -free remission at Week 52.

CONFIDENTIALDuration of Treatment:
52-week treatment periodPeriod of Evaluation:
The study  includes a 3 -week Screening Period, a 
52-week Treatment Period (with last dose at Week 50), 
and an 18-week Follow -up Period following last dose. 
The duration of the study will be approximately 
71weeks. Additionally, subjects will be required to 
participate in a long -term follow -up (LTFU) safety 
survey  by [CONTACT_756], [ADDRESS_316457] dose of 
study drug.
Main Criteria for Inclusion:
The subject has a diagnosis of UC established at least [ADDRESS_316458] has moderately to severely active UC as determined by a complete Mayo score of 6 -12 with an endoscopic 
subscore ≥2 within 14 days prior to random ization.
The s ubjects hasevidence of UC extending proximal to the rectum ( ≥15 cm of involved colon).
The subject has had previous treatment with tumor necrosis factor –alpha ( TNF -α)antago nists without documented 
clinical response to treatment or the subject is naïve to TNF -α antagonist therapy but is failing current conventional 
treatment.
Main Criteria for Exclusion:
The subject has had extensive colonic resection, subtotal or tot al colectomy.
The subject has any evidence of an active infection during Screening. 
The subject has a positive progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) subjective checklist before the 
administration of study drug. 
The s ubject has received any inv estigational or approved biologic or biosimilar agent within 60 days or 5 half lives 
prior to screening (whichever is longer).
The subject has had prior exposure to vedolizumab, natalizumab, efalizumab, adalimumab or rituximab.
Main Criteria for Evaluatio n and Analyses:
The primary endpoint for the study is proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission (defined as a complete Mayo 
score of ≤2points and no individual subscore >1 point) at Week 52.
Secondary endpoints for this study are:
Proportio n of subjects achieving mucosal healing (defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1point) at Week 52 .
Proportio n of subjects using oral corticosteroids at Baseline who have discontinued corticosteroids and are in 
clinical remission at Week 52.
Statistical Considerations:
All efficacy analyses will be based on the full analysis set ( FAS), with the exception of corticosteroid-free remission, 
which will be based on FAS subjects with baseline concomitant oral corticosteroid use. All statistical inference will b e 
2-sided at a 0.05 level of significance.
All proportion -based efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) tests stratified by 
[CONTACT_188207]. The p -values and point estimates of risk difference along with 95% CIs will be 
provided. All subjects with missing data for determination of endpoint status will be considered as a non -responder in 
the analy sis.
To control the overall Type I error rate of the primary and secondary endpoints, a hierarchical approach w ill be applied 
to the statistical testing of the secondary endpoints. The first secondary endpoint will only be tested if statistical 
significance is achieved with the primary endpoint, the second secondary endpoint will only be tested if statistical 
signi ficance is achieved with the first secondary endpoint.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 Ulcerative Colitis and Current Treatments 
Inflammatory  bowel  disease (IBD) i s a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory  disorder o f the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract that includes 2 ent ities, namely ulcerat ive colit is (UC) and Crohn’s 
disease (CD). 
UC i s a chroni c, rel apsing, inflammatory  disorder of the GI tract. UC is characterized by [CONTACT_260214], 
superficial inflammat ion of the colonic mucosa that begins in the rectum and extends proximally 
to invo lve any cont iguous length of colon. The prevalence of UC is approximately 200/100,000 of 
the [LOCATION_002] populat ion and approximately 150/100,000 of the populat ion in Western Europe 
[1-3]. A genetic contribut ion to the disease is indicated by [CONTACT_260215] o f UC (of 30 to 
100 times that of the general populat ion) am ong first -degree relatives of pat ients with UC. The 
characterist ic patho logy is one of chronic inflamma tion characterized by [CONTACT_260216].
Clinical manifestations of UC include diarrhea, ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_260202] , as wel l as abdo minal pain, fecal 
urgency, and incont inence. Systemic features such as fever, weight loss, malaise, and fat igue are 
indicators of more extensive disease. Extra -intestinal manifestations such as uveit is, arthrit is, 
ankylo sis spondylit is, or primary sclerosing cho langitis may also be seen in conjunct ion with IBD.  
The di agnosis of UC is usually  made by [CONTACT_260217] , 
physical examinat ion, in co mbinat ion with laboratory  studies.
Current treatments have been effective for many patients with UC but have numerous limitat ions 
for pati ents wi th moderately to severely act ive disease. 5- aminosalicylates (5 -ASAs) are the 
mainstay  of UC pharmacotherapy  for induct ion and maintenance of remissio n for patients with 
mild t o moderate di sease, but are less effective in severe disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_260203], the benefit is 
debatable in moderate to severe ly active UC [4,5]. 
Corti costeroi ds are often required for the 1/3 of patients who fail to respond to 5 -ASAs [6,7]. 
While highly effect ive for induct ion of remissio n, corti costeroi ds are not recommended for 
maintenance of remissio n and carry  significant undesi rable side effects, including osteoporosis, 
glucose i ntolerance, and increased risk of infect ion. 
Immunomodulatory  agents, including [ADDRESS_316462] a role in 
maintenance of remissio n in moderately to severely  active UC. Thei r relatively slow onset of 
action precludes their use durin g flares of disease, and the use o f these agents has been reported to 
potenti ally increase the ri sk of lymphoma in patients with IBD [8]. Other severe adverse events 
(AEs) associated with use of immun omodulators i nclude cy topenias, hepat itis, and infection.
Intravenous (IV) cy closporine has a role in the management of severely  active UC; however, it is 
impract ical in non -hospi [INVESTIGATOR_9643], requi res intense monitoring, and may cause irreversible 
nephrotoxi city, all of which limit its use.

Protocol 26 February 2015
CONFIDENTIALMonoclonal  antibodies (mAbs) directed against tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF- α) have been 
approved for the treatment of UC in many countries world -wide, including infliximab (Remicade ), 
which is administered by [CONTACT_113925] n, and adalimumab (Humira) and go limumab (Simponi), 
which are administered by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection [9-11]. These agents have substant ially 
improved the care of patients with UC by [CONTACT_260218] n and decreasing the 
need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_260204], and other complicat ions. Alt hough TNF -α antagoni sts 
represent an important addit ion to the UC pharmacol ogic arm amentari um, they  are effect ive in 
only a subset of patients, with roughly 2/[ADDRESS_316463] y ear of therapy  [12,13]. Induction of rem ission with infliximab occurs in only 31% to 
39% of patients with UC [14]and durable clinical remission (ie, defined as clinical remissio n at 
Weeks 8, 30, and 54) occurs i n only 26% of pat ients with UC. In addit ion, controlled studies have 
demonstrated that, after failure of [ADDRESS_316464], a patient’s response to a second TNF -α 
antagonist is substant ially lower [15]. The TNF -α antagonists are also associated with a number of 
serious safet y concerns based on their suppressio n of systemic immunit y, including react ivation of 
tuberculosis (TB); various bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic infect ions; and malignancies, 
such as hepatosplenic T cell lympho ma [9,10].The TNF -α antagonists are also associated with a 
number of serious safet y concerns based on their suppressio n of systemic immunit y[9,10].
Failure of pharmaco logical therapy  leads to col ectomy  in 9% to 35% of pat ients with UC wi thin 
5years. Colectomy is considered to be an important adjunct treatm ent for refractory UC; however, 
colectomy wi th ileal pouch anal anastomosis (the standard surgica l therapy) has m any limit ations 
and is associated with its own set of complications, including high stool frequency [16], female 
infertilit y [17], and a cumulative incidence of pouchit is of 50% at 10 years [18]. The limitat ions of 
current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_260205] a significant need for safer and more effect ive 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014].
4.1.2 Vedolizumab IV
Vedolizumab (also called MLN0002) is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 mAb directed 
against the human lymphocy te integrin α 4β7. The α 4β7integrin mediates lymphocy te trafficking to 
GI mucosa and gut -associ ated lympho id tissue (GALT) through adhesive interaction with mucosal 
addressin cell adhesio n molecule -1 (MAdCAM -1), which is expressed on the endothelium o f 
mesenteric lymph nodes and GI mucosa [19-22]. Vedolizumab binds the α 4β7integrin, 
antagonizing its adherence to MAdCAM -1 and as such, impairs the migrat ion of gut homing 
leukocy tes into GI m ucosa. As a resul t, vedolizumab acts as a gut- selective immuno modulator 
[23]. Vedolizumab has been developed as a treatment for UC and CD, which are characterized by 
[CONTACT_260219]. 
Vedolizumab IV (also known as ENTYVIO; KYNTELES; Vedolizumab for Inject ion, for 
Intravenous Use; Vedo lizumab Powder for Concentrate for Solut ion for Infusion; or MLN0002 
IV) has been granted market ing approval in several regio ns, including the US and European 
Unio n, for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely act ive UC or CD who have 
failed c onventi onal treatm ent. The init ial approved dosing and administration regimen consists of

pharmacokinet ic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and immunogenicit y of vedo lizumab. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical
Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted with vedo lizumab and its murine 
homolo gue, Act -1. Act -1 has demonstrated clinical and histomorpho logic evi dence of efficacy  in 
an animal model of IBD (cotton -top tamarins). Extensive nonclinical evaluat ions of the 
cardi ovascular, acute, local, subchronic, chronic, immunologic , and reproductive toxicit y of 
vedo lizumab in pharmaco logically responsive species (New Zealand white rabbit s and 
cyno molgus monkeys) have been conducted and support its clinical development. Nonclinical 
studi es also show that vedolizumab does not antagoni ze 4β1integrin [23].
[IP_ADDRESS] Human Experience
Single-and mult iple-dose PK of vedolizumab IV have been studied in healt hy subjects and in 
patients with moderately to severely act ive UC or CD and similar PK was observed. Vedolizumab 
exhibits target -mediated drug disposit ion; hence, its eliminat ion is characterized by [CONTACT_260220]. Following IV infusio n, vedo lizumab serum concentrati ons generally fell in a 
biexponent ial fashion until approximately 1 to 10 µg/mL, with a linear total body  clearance of 
approximately  0.157 L/day  and a serum  half-life of around [ADDRESS_316466] 1 dose of vedolizumab across all studies in

placebo) adverse react ions in subjects administered vedo lizumab were nausea, nasophary ngitis, 
upper respi [INVESTIGATOR_2826], arthralgia, py rexia, fat igue, headache, and cough. Most serious 
adverse events have been related to exacerbations or complicat ions of the underlying UC or CD. 
For those infect ions that were reported more frequent ly in vedo lizumab -treated subjects, the sites 
of these infect ions correl ated wi th the known t issue di stribut ion of MAdCAM -[ADDRESS_316470] ions (bronchit is, pneumo nia, urinary  tract infect ion, sepsis) 
occurred at low frequency ( 1). A total  of 4% of vedolizumab -treated subjects and 3% of 
placebo -treated subjects experienced an infusio n-related reaction. In Studies C13006 and C1300 7, 
10% of subjects were posit ive for antivedo lizumab antibodies [ADDRESS_316471] been reported to date. 
Concomitant use of corticosteroids and/or convent ional immuno modulators di d not appear to be
associ ated wi th any increased rate of infect ions based on the comparative rates of infections in the 
phase 3 trials amo ng subjects who had and had not received these medicat ions. 
As of 20 July 2014, a total of 14 on -study  deaths (including [ADDRESS_316472]) were 
reported in the vedo lizumab clinical development program, including the ongoing open -label 
long-term extensio n study  C13008. The causes of death varied and detailed informat ion can be 
found in the current version of the IB. 
Overall, vedo lizumab IV was well tolerated in clinical studies.
4.1.3 Adalimumab
Adalimumab (HUMIRA) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal ant ibody  specific for human 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Adalimumab was created using phage display  technol ogy resul ting 
in an ant ibody  with human derived heavy and light chain variable regions and human IgG1:k 
constant regions. Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF -alpha and blocks its interaction with the 
Vedolizumab IV
Study No. MLN0002 -[ADDRESS_316473] ivate lymphotoxin 
(TNF -beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is invo lved in norm al inflammatory  and 
immune responses. TNF plays an important role in both the pathol ogic inflammat ion and the jo int 
destruction that are hallmarks of inflammatory  diseases. Adalimumab also modulates bio logical  
responses that are induced or regulated by  [CONTACT_51004], incl uding changes in the levels of adhesio n 
molecules responsible for leukoc yte migration.
The Ulcerative co litis Long-Term Remissi on and maintenance with Adalimumab -(ULTRA -2) 
clinical trial was a rando mized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy o f 
adalimumab SC in induct ion and maintenance of clinical remissi on in 494 subjects with moderate 
to-severe UC who received concurrent treatm ent with oral corticosteroids or immune -suppressants 
[27]. Subjects were rando mly assigned to groups administered adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 
80mg at Week 2, and then 40 mg or placebo once every 2 weeks (Q2W). The co -primary 
endpo ints were remissio n at Weeks [ADDRESS_316474] ically significant 
reponse in remissio n rates at both Week 8 and 52. This was observed in both group of pat ients 
naïve to treatment with tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF- α) antagonists, among subjects who had 
previously received TNF -α antagonists. Adalimumab was safe and more effective than placebo in 
inducing and maintaining clinical remission in subjects with moderate -to-severe UC who did not 
have an adequate response to convent ional therapy with steroi ds or immunosuppressants [27-29]. 
Current treatments have been effective for many patients with UC but have numerous limitat ions 
indicat ing that t here is still a need for safer and more effect ive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

and adalimumab SC.
The proposed vedolizumab IV dose (300 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 and Q8W, thereafter) is 
consistent with the approved label informat ion [30].
The proposed adalimumab SC dose regimen ([ADDRESS_316476] ion at 
Week 2 and 40 mg Q2W thereafter) is consistent with the approved label informat ion [10].
Pharmacogeno mic analysis may be conducted to investigate the contribut ion of genet ic variance 
on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety . Parti cipat ion of study subjects in 
pharmacogeno mic sample co llection is optional.
As pharmacogeno mics is an evo lving science, current ly many genes and their function are not yet 
fully understood. Future data may suggest a role of some of these genes in drug response or 
diseases, which may  lead to addi tional hypothesis- generat ing exploratory  research on stored 
samples.

6.1 Study Design
This is a phase 3b rando mized, double -blind, double -dummy , mul ticenter, active -controlled stud y 
to eval uate the efficacy  and safety  of vedo lizumab compared to adalimumab over a 52 -week 
treatm ent peri od. The study  will be conducted gl obally  and will  include 658 subjects (329 per 
treatm ent group) wi th moderately to severely  active UC.
The study  consists of a 3-week Screening Period, a 52 -week Treatment Period (with last dose at 
Week 50), and an [ADDRESS_316477] dose. Addit ionally , subjects will be 
requi red to participate in a long -term follow-up (LTFU) safet y sur vey by [CONTACT_756], [ADDRESS_316478] moderately to severely active UC, defined as Mayo score 6 -12 and endoscopic 
subscore ≥[ADDRESS_316479] treatment 
and those who failedTNF -α therapy  will be allowed to enroll; however, the proportion of TNF -α 
antagonist naïve subj ects shall  not exceed approximately 50% of  the total number of subjects 
enrolled into the study. 
On Day 1, subjects who meet the inclusio n criteria and who meet none of the exclusion criteria will 
undergo baseline evaluat ions and be rando mly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to double -blind medicat ion 
for 50weeks. Rando mizat ion will be stratified by:
Concomita nt use of oral  corti costeroi ds.
Previous failure of TNF -αantagonist therapy  or naïve to TNF -αantagonist therapy .
Subjects in the vedo lizumab treatment group will receive a [ADDRESS_316480] ion on Day 1 (four [ADDRESS_316481] ions in one day or two 40 mg injections per day for two consecut ive days), 80 mg at Week 
2 (two 40 mg injections in one day ), then 40 m g Q2W thereafter until Week 50, as well as a 
placebo IV infusio n at Day 1 and Weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46. Subjects who do not respond 
to treatment based on the investigator’s discret ion should be withdrawn and treated according to 
standard of care. After the Week [ADDRESS_316482] a Fo llow-Up Visit,

The primary endpo int evaluated in this study will be clinical remissio n at Week 52. Because UC is 
a progressive disease with lo ng-term structural  and f unctional co mplications, the duration of the 
study  is proposed as 52 weeks to provide a long- term com parison of the efficacy data. Other 
secondary  endpoints, will include mucosal healing, corticosteroid- free remissio n, and addit ional 
endpo ints will also be pat ient-reported outcomes (PROs) and AEs. Mucosal healing has been 
associ ated wi th better outcom es for U C pati ents, such as reduct ion in co lectomies and less 
treatm ent failure [27].Corticosteroid use is associated with inadequate disease control and can 
lead in so me subjects to adverse reactions; therefore, minimizing corticosteroid use as a treatment 
goal will benefit subjects [28]. PROs provide a complement to the clinical data collected as they  
focus on the subject’s assessment of their disease.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a drug whether or 
not it is considered related to the drug. In addit ion, drug -device AEs related to qualit y or 
malfunct ion will be collected.
10.1.[ADDRESS_316547] finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagno sis or unexpected worsening of a pre- exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre exist ing condit ions underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuati on or a change in dose of study medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168].
PTEs/AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.
Diagnose s vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory values or ECG paramete rs are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if the y 
are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some ac tion or i ntervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
Vedolizumab IV
Study No. MLN0002 -[ADDRESS_316548] and/or continued monitoring o f an abnormal value are not considered an 
intervent ion. In addit ion, repe ated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluatio n 
or monitoring of an abnormalit y is not considered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, in creased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, l aboratory  tests, ECG, X -rays etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless 
related to study  procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complication 
of such a concurr ent condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study medicat ion) or 
an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after start of study medicat ion). Investigators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_260208] m ore frequent, serious or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumato id arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion shoul d only  be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater 
extent to that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsenin g of…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of a PTE after starting administration of 
the study  medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE. Invest igators should ensure t hat the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a new AE. Investi gators 
shoul d ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).

CONFIDENTIALChanges in severit y of AEs /Seri ous PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
perform ed earl y (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the 
worsening of the condit ion should be captured appropriately as a PTE or an AE. Complicat ions 
resul ting fro m any planned surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion, should NOT be recorded as 
an AE. The invest igator must make the dist inction bet ween exacerbation o f pre-exist ing illne ss 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any  medicati on wi thout m anifested si de effects are NOT considered

CONFIDENTIAL10.1.7 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments.
10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (ca usality) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related. 
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of the AE /PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_14426]/or physician.
10.1.10 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died.
10.1.11 Frequency 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c AEs/ PTE (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous.
10.1.12 Action Concerning Study Medication 
Drug withdrawn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not ch anged –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not Applicable –a study  medicat ion was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE eg, 
the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing wit h study  medicat ion was already  
stopped before the onset of the AE.
Dose Interrupted –the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.

Recovered/Resolved – Subject returned to first a ssessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  [CONTACT_45332] m ore stages: the di agnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the

A PML Independent Adjudicat ion Committee (IAC) will be implemented for this study. The PML 
IAC will consist of a panel of leading PML experts, including a neuro logist, neuroradio logist, and 
a viro logist. 
11.1.1 Risk Minimization Action Plan for PML (RAMP Program)
Natalizumab (TYSABRI), another integrin receptor antagonist, has been associated with 
progressive mult ifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and often fatal opportunistic infect ion 
of the central  nervous system . PML i s caused by [CONTACT_204896] (JCV) and ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_260210] [34,35]. Natalizumab is a pan -α4integrin 
antagonist that binds to both the α 4β1and α 4β7integrins and inhibits cellular adhesio n to VCAM -1 
and MAdCAM -1 [36,37]. In contrast, vedolizumab binds to the α4β7integrin only [23]and inhibits 
adhesio n to MAdCAM -1, but not VCAM -1. Al though no cases o f PML have been reported in 
clinical trials wit h vedo lizumab to date, a risk o f PML cannot be ruled out.
To address the theoretical risk o f the development of PML in subjects treated wi th vedo lizumab, 
the sponsor, with input fro m renowned PML experts, has developed a Risk Minimization Act ion 
Plan for PML, the RAMP. The complete description of the RAMP program, including materials 
and instructions for its implementation and mo nitoring, is included in the Study  Manual. 
The RAMP is focused on early  clinical detecti on and management of that specific safet y risk, 
including the discont inuat ion of study  drug, if applicable. Subjects are assessed for signs and 
symptoms of PML prior to the admini strati on of  each dose of study  drug using a PML subject ive 
symptom  checklist. Subj ects wi th a posi tive PML subjective symptom checklist at any  time after 
enrollment in a vedolizumab clinical study will be evaluated according to a prespecified algorithm 
(the PML Case Evaluat ion Algori thm). The next dose of study  drug will be held unt il the 
evaluat ion is co mplete and results are available. Subsequent doses of study  will be administered 
only if the possibilit y of PML is definit ively  excluded, as described in t he RAMP algorithm. An 
IAC has been stabled as part of the RAMP program to review new neuro logical signs and 
symptoms potentially  consistent wi th PML, and will provide input regarding subject evaluat ion 
and management as defined in the IAC charter. 
To ensu re success of the RAMP program, site personnel will be trained to recognize the features of 
PML, and subjects will be trained to report specific neurological signs and symptoms without 
delay. Educati onal materi als for teaching site personnel and subjects a bout PML and the RAMP 
procedures will be distributed to all sites and are included in the Study Manual. Formal teaching 
and training will be performed for site personnel prior to the start of the study . Subjects will 
receive training and educat ional materi als prior to receiving treatment. The informed consent form 
will contain specific informat ion on the hy potheti cal risk of PML. Any documented case of PML 
will be reported as an SAE, regardless of whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149323]. Adjudicat ion Co mmit tee

13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A stati stical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and fina lized prior to unblinding of subject’s 
treatm ent assi gnment. Thi s docum ent will provide further details regarding the definit ion of 
analysis variables and analysis methodology  to address all study  object ives.
A blinded data review meeting will be conducted prior to unblinding of subject’s treatment 
assignment. This review will assess the accuracy and co mpleteness of the study  database, subject 
evaluabilit y, and appropri ateness of the planned statist ical methods.
13.1.1 Analysis Sets
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) wil l include all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
study  drug. Subj ects in this set will be analyzed according to the treatment they  were randomized 
to receive.
The Per-Protocol (PP) P opulation is a subset of the intent -to-treat populat ion. The PP Populat ion 
consists of all subjects who do not vio late the terms of the protocol in a way that would impact the 
study  output si gnificant ly. All decisio ns to exclude subjects for the PPPopulat ion dataset will be 
made prior to the unblinding of the st udy. Analyses using the per -protocol  popul ation may be 
provi ded as a sensit ivity analysis .
The Safet y Analysis Set will include all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_316567] ics (non -missing values, mean, median, 
SD, minimum and maximum) will be generated. For categorical variables, the counts and 
percentages of each possible value will be generated.
Medical history  and concurrent medical condit ions will be summarized by [CONTACT_39812]. Medicat ion history  and conco mitant medicat ions will be summarized by [CONTACT_39813].
13.1.3 Efficacy Analysis
All efficacy analyses will be based on the FAS, wi th the exception of corticosteroid -free 
remission, which will be based on FAS subjects with baseline conco mitant oral corticosteroid use. 
All statistical inference will be 2 -sided at a 0.05 l evel of significance.
All proportion -based efficacy endpo ints wil l be analyzed using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) 
tests stratified by  [CONTACT_260232]. The p-values and po int estimates of risk

CONFIDENTIALdifference along wit h 95% CIs will be provided. All subjects wi th missing data for determination 
of endpo int status will be considered as a non -responder in the analysis.
To control  the overall Type I error rate of the primary  and secondary  endpoints, a hi erarchical 
approach will be applied to the statist ical testing of the secondary endpo ints. The first secondary  
endpo int, proportion of subject achieving mucosal healing at Week 52, will only be tested if 
statist ical significance is achieved with the primary  endpoint. The second secondary  endpoint, 
proporti on of subjects using oral corticosteriods at Base line who have discont inued corticosteriods 
and in clinical remissio n at Week 52, will only be tested if statist ical significance is achieved wit h 
the first secondary  endpoint.
Testing of the addit ional efficacy  endpoints will  not be m ultiplicit y-controlled . The following 
analyses will be performed on endpo ints that are not proportion -based:
Change from Baseline in oral corticosteroid use will be summarized for FAS subjects with 
baseline conco mitant oral  corti costeroi ds use, and tested using Wilcoxon rank- sum test.
Change from Baseline in fecal calprotectin will be analyzed with an analysis of covariance 
model with treatm ent and randomizat ion stratificatio n factors as factors and Baseline fecal 
calprotectin as a covariate.

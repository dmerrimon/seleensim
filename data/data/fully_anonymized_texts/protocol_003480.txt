Protocol Summary  Full Title:     Improving Cognitive Health in COVID-19 Survivors through Digital Therapeutics Short Title:    Cognitive Health in COVID-19  Clinical Phase:   II Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_512074], PhD  Study Description:   Emerging evidence suggests a subgroup of survivors of COVID-[ADDRESS_662352] quality of life after recovery from other COVID-19 symptoms. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of AKL-T01 (Akili Interactive), a remotely-delivered digital cognitive intervention, in targeting and improving cognition and functional outcomes in individuals recovering from COVID-19. The efficacy of the AKL-T01 intervention will be measured relative to a waitlist control group.  Sample Size:  Our target sample size will be [ADDRESS_662353] control arm.  Enrollment:  Our total enrollment will be 125, requiring that we screen up to 500 individuals. We anticipate approximately 75% of individuals will not be eligible based on screening criteria. Further we anticipate approximately 20% of participants who are eligible will elect not to continue participation prior to initiation of intervention.    Study Population:  The study population will be individuals who were diagnosed with COVID-[ADDRESS_662354] a deficit in cognition (i.e., attention and/or executive skills > 1 SD below the normal range). The target age range will be adults 18-89 years of age.   Enrollment Period:  We expect the enrollment period to last 12 months.   Study Design:  This study is a randomized clinical trial designed to compare efficacy of the AKL-T01 intervention relative to a waitlist control in patients who were infected with COVID-19. Participants will be selected for the presence of cognitive dysfunction prior to enrollment in the trial and will be randomized to the intervention arm or the waitlist control arm. They will complete an assessment battery designed to assess cognition, functional outcomes, and

 Page # 2  mood symptoms at pre-intervention (at study entry) and post-intervention (following [ADDRESS_662355]). The assessment battery will also be administered bi-weekly during the intervention period (i.e., at weeks 2 and 4), and [ADDRESS_662356] design; at the end of the intervention period, participants in the control group will have the option to receive the 6-week AKL-T01 intervention. Note that study visits will take place remotely and devices for intervention administration will be mailed to participants. Description of Sites/  Facilities Enrolling Participants:  Participants will be enrolled through facilities of the Manhattan Campuses of NewYork-Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] (NYP)/Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), as well as the NewYork-Presby[CONTACT_512083].   Study Duration:  The study duration will be two years, including [ADDRESS_662357] data analysis and one additional year to publish results of the study.  Participant Duration: Participants in the AKL-T01 intervention group will be enrolled in this study for approximately 10 weeks, comprised of the 6-week intervention period and week 10 longitudinal follow-up (4 weeks after completing the intervention). Participants in the waitlist control group who choose to begin the intervention after the initial 6-week period will be enrolled for [ADDRESS_662358] period, the 6-week intervention, and week 16 longitudinal follow-up (4 weeks after completing the intervention).  Study Agent/Device Name  [CONTACT_57443]: AKL-T01 will be administered as a 6-week intervention. It is an algorithmically delivered iPad-based video game designed to improve cognitive health by [CONTACT_512084]. Participants enrolled in the intervention arm will play the game via an iPad application for 20-[ADDRESS_662359]  5 days a week (but up to 7 days a week). Participants will also have weekly check-in visits via phone or a secure HIPAA-compliant videoconferencing platform (Zoom) with a care manager, who will monitor mood symptoms and gameplay adherence.  Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the AKL-T01 intervention relative to a waitlist control in improving

Background  2.1 Disease  Cognitive deficits are frequent, persistent, and disabling following critical illness. They are increasingly recognized as a common complication of COVID-19. Multiple factors associated with the illness and its treatment may contribute to cognitive sequelae. These include hypoxia, ventilation, sedation, delirium, cerebrovascular events, and inflammation. 81% of patients had cognitive impairment, ranging from mild to severe. In our preliminary study of cognitive impairment in [ADDRESS_662366] common in working memory (55% of patients impaired), multitasking (47%), divided attention (46%), and processing speed (40%) (Jaywant et al., under review); these deficits were more common than deficits in memory. An additional study of [ADDRESS_662367] Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223] (SARS) and Middle East Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223] (MERS). Further, cognitive dysfunction is a known predictor of long-term functional disability.  2.2 Investigational Agent/Device, or Surgical Treatment/Method  The study intervention, AKL-T01 (Akili Interactive) is a digital intervention. The intervention was designed to target and improve cognition through a fun and engaging video game played on an iPad. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in individuals across the lifespan with mental health disorders that commonly have symptoms of cognitive dysfunction, such as depression and ADHD. AKL-T01 recently received FDA clearance for the improvement of attention in children with ADHD (Kollins et al., 2020). Further, our group has shown that this video game intervention is non-inferior to gold standard psychotherapy in improving cognition and symptoms of depression (Anguera et al., 2017) and improves cognitive control at the neural, behavioral, and self-report levels (Gunning et al., under review). 
Protocol # 20-11022977 Version Date 11/18/2022  
 Page # [ADDRESS_662368] to demonstrate deficits in our sample of individuals previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (Jaywant et al., under review). The video game combines aspects of navigation and target identification. It uses an innovative algorithmic design that adjusts to individuals’ ability levels, such that the complexity and cognitive load increases as the game progresses in an optimized and personalized fashion.  2.[ADDRESS_662369] quality of life after recovery from other COVID-19 symptoms (Jaywant et al., under review). Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate the efficacy of potentially beneficial cognitive interventions such as AKL-T01 (primary objective of the study) that can be widely disseminated. The telehealth, iPad-based nature of AKL-T01 is critical in mitigating the spread of infection during the ongoing COVID-[ADDRESS_662370]-intervention and generalize to related cognitive functions (secondary objectives) is also important in determining the transfer of gains to broader cognitive skills and to their endurance once the intervention is concluded.   Anxiety, depression, and fatigue have been reported after COVID-19 (Garrigues et al., 2020), are related to attention and executive functions (Zhou et al., 2020),and are known to be associated with daily function. Our previous work has demonstrated that the AKL-T01 intervention can improve mood symptoms in adults with major depression. Thus, an exploratory objective is to determine whether the AKL-T01 intervention improves symptoms of depression, anxiety, and fatigue, which is important in determining additional impacts of the intervention that have ramifications for COVID-19 survivors’ daily function and quality of life.   We anticipate that the results of this study will inform refinement and improvement of AKL-T01 for COVID-19 and provide valuable data for future study of the intervention.  2.4  Risk/Benefit Assessment   2.4.1 Known Potential Risks  This study presents no greater than minimal risk. The potential risks of participation are frustration, feeling anxious and/or fatigued during intervention gameplay and assessment administration. There is also a risk that participants may develop headaches during gameplay, due to the fast-paced nature of the game and the need to focus on the screen during the intervention. To mitigate risk, we will emphasize that participants can take breaks as frequently as they would like when completing the intervention exercises. The computerized exercises are graded in difficulty (i.e., start relatively easy and becoming more challenging over time) and adapt to the participant’s cognitive skill level, which will mitigate the risk of frustration and feelings of anxiety. 
Protocol # 20-11022977 Version Date 11/18/2022  
 Page # 10   2.4.2 Known Potential Benefits   This study has the potential to improve participants’ cognitive and daily function. The AKL-T01 intervention has been shown to improve mood symptoms, as well as executive skills and cognitive control through measures of neural activation and connectivity, performance on tasks measuring working memory and sustained attention, and self-reported symptoms of cognitive control function in adults diagnosed with depression (Anguera et al, 2017; Bove et al., 2019; Gunning et al., under review). The control group also has the potential to improve their cognitive and daily function as they will be given the opportunity to begin the intervention after the waitlist period.  2.4.3 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  We will use study procedures designed to maximize the benefit and minimize the risk of participation in this study. Participants in the intervention arm will receive adequate training in gameplay (~45 minute training session with a member of the study team) and have weekly check-ins with trained care managers to troubleshoot issues with the game and monitor gameplay adherence. Participants in the waitlist control arm will also have weekly check-in visits with a care manager.  Assessment sessions will be conducted by [CONTACT_75842]-level investigators of this study protocol or Research Assistants who have received extensive training in assessment administration. The assessment battery for this study was optimized to provide measures across a range of cognitive and functional domains that we expect to be impacted in COVID-[ADDRESS_662371] that the potential benefits of participation outweigh the minimal risks. Participants may experience an improvement in multiple aspects of cognition and daily functioning in COVID-19 survivors. The knowledge gained would inform future clinical trials.  Plan to Address Subjects with Suicidal Ideation and/or Other Mental Health Needs Suicidal ideation may be identified by [CONTACT_127659]-9. Identification of suicidal ideation will trigger a suicide risk assessment following an established protocol and algorithm developed by [CONTACT_512089] (see attached form). The suicide risk assessment will be completed under the supervision of a licensed clinician or by [CONTACT_512090]. Depending on the level of risk, study staff may provide referrals for further care, which may include outpatient or inpatient treatment according to clinical indication. Involuntary admission may become necessary in patients at acute and imminent risk for harming themselves. In the unlikely event that a licensed clinician is not available for immediate clinical evaluation of a subject reporting suicidal intent or plan, the research staff member will contact [CONTACT_463671].

If the subject is classified as having High Risk with imminent danger of self-harm, then the study staff member will contact [CONTACT_463671].  Risk assessment and safety monitoring will be conducted under the supervision of study staff who are licensed clinical psychologists  2.5 Correlative Studies Background  In a preliminary study (Jaywant et al., under review), we evaluated the frequency, severity, and profile of cognitive dysfunction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512075]-19. We obtained and analyzed cross-sectional neuropsychological data from a cohort of N=57 patients participating in inpatient rehabilitation. 81% of patients had cognitive impairment, ranging from mild to severe. Deficits were most common in working memory (55% of patients impaired), set-shifting (47%), divided attention (46%), and processing speed (40%). Executive dysfunction was not significantly associated with intubation length or the time from extubation to assessment, nor was it associated with the presence of a psychiatric diagnosis. The results highlight the importance of studying interventions that target attention and executive functioning after COVID-19. Given the prevalence of COVID-19, targeting these deficits through scalable cognitive interventions that have been demonstrated to improve similar deficits and can be widely disseminated in patients’ homes through reliance on technology may support optimal cognitive and functional outcomes.  3. Study Design  3.1 Overall Design  The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of AKL-T01 (Akili Interactive), a remotely-delivered digital cognitive intervention, in targeting and improving cognition and functional outcomes in individuals recovering from COVID-19. The efficacy of the AKL-T01 intervention will be measured relative to a waitlist control group. We hypothesize that the AKL-T01 intervention will show greater efficacy relative to the waitlist control at improving cognitive and daily function in COVID-[ADDRESS_662373] (Epic) for NYP, Weill Cornell Medicine. Potential participants can also be referred by [CONTACT_221003]. We will also contact [CONTACT_512091]-19 research studies at NYP/WCM and agreed to be contact[CONTACT_393694]. We will also post flyers at NYP/Weill Cornell Medical Center and other relevant locations in the greater [LOCATION_001] City area.  Due to the ongoing threat of COVID-19 and the remote nature of this trial, informed consent will also be obtained remotely. For participants with access to technology that will allow them to consent electronically, the participant and the member of the research team (co-

 Page # 12  investigator or trained research assistant) obtaining informed consent will meet over a HIPAA-compliant video conference platform (i.e., Zoom). At the start of this video meeting, the researcher will share their screen and highlight each section of the consent form while discussing it with the participant. After discussing the consent form with the participant, they can then re-read it and sign it via REDCap. These participants will be provided with a PDF of their signed consent form for their records.  For participants without access to technology that would allow them to consent electronically, the participant and researcher will review to consent form over the phone. A copy of the consent form will be mailed or emailed to the participant in advance so that it can be viewed by [CONTACT_512092]. They will return the signed consent form in a stamped, self-addressed envelope provided by [CONTACT_3021]. These participants will then be mailed a copy of their signed consent form for their records.  To screen prospective participants, we will conduct an initial screening via a secure HIPAA-compliant videoconferencing platform (Zoom). Participants will be queried for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will be administered via Zoom the Oral Trail Making Test, Stroop Test, and the Frontal Systems Behavior Rating Scale (FrSBe). Participants will be eligible for enrollment if they score <[ADDRESS_662374] period.

Participants in the control arm who begin the intervention at the conclusion of the waitlist period: The week [ADDRESS_662377] at week 16 ([ADDRESS_662378]-intervention).   See Section 6.1 for the complete Schedule of Assessments.   Participants will be aware of their assignment to study arm because it is not possible to blind them. The research team members conducting the study assessments will be blind to assignments. The care managers will not be blinded because it is not possible to blind them and it is necessary for them to know of a participant’s assignment to assist in troubleshooting.

Because the control group will not be engaging in any active control condition, there is potential for dropout; however, we will mitigate this dropout via weekly check-ins from the care managers and by [CONTACT_512094]-in visits to encourage retention.    3.3 Justification for Dose   Participants will complete 6 weeks of the AKL-T01 intervention. Previous research supports improvement of cognition following 4 weeks of the intervention, however continued improvement in a 4 week period after the intervention was observed. However, we are proposing a 6 week intervention to maximize the potential for cognitive change in COVID-19 survivors and because the overall gameplay dose is small (20-25 minutes daily for 5 days a week), and the additional time and remote delivery will not present additional burden to the participants.  3.[ADDRESS_662380] Selection  4.1 Study Population  The study population will be individuals who were diagnosed with COVID-19 (determined by a documented previous positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection) and have a deficit in cognition (i.e., attention and/or executive skills > 1 SD below the normal range).   4.2 Inclusion Criteria 1.

 Page # 15   4.6 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  We will recruit subjects from the Weill Cornell/NYP system.  We anticipate that we will have to screen up to [ADDRESS_662383], via social media, study flyers and posters, and via referral from providers throughout NYP and WCM. We will attempt to recruit an equal number of males and females; however, anticipate that our sample will reflect current demographic estimates of prevalence of COVID-19, i.e., increased prevalence of severe illness in men. We anticipate that a significant percentage of our sample may be of African American race and/or Hispanic ethnicity due to known racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19. We will contact [CONTACT_512095].   We will be recruiting individuals with cognitive impairment because we hypothesize that our intervention has the potential to improve cognitive deficits in this population. We will determine whether participants can sign consent by [CONTACT_512096]-back methods to verify comprehension of risks and benefits. We will also use a capacity to consent form (see attachment) to verify comprehension of risks and benefits for subjects deemed to have more than mild impairment based on clinician interview.

During the screening visit, participants will meet via HIPAA-compliant video conferencing platform with a PhD-level member of the study team. During this visit, potential participants will be screened for the cognitive deficit required for participation in the study. Eligible participants will be randomized to the intervention arm or the waitlist control arm in a 1:1 using a computer-generated randomization scheme developed by [CONTACT_512097]. A block randomization approach will be used based on a block of 6.  The screening visit will include the following study procedures: • Informed consent • Demographics (in EMR or collected at screening visit) • Medical / medication history (in EMR or collected at screening visit) • Additional Medical/Psychiatric symptom screening (completed by [CONTACT_86842]) • Cognitive screening (Oral Trail Making Test, Stroop Test, FrSBe)     6.1.2 Treatment Phase       [IP_ADDRESS] Week 0 (Baseline/Pre-Intervention), Week 6 (Post-Intervention), Week 12 (Post-Intervention; waitlist control participants only)   The pre- and post-intervention visits will take place at the beginning and the end of the intervention period.

Participants will be aware of their assignment to study arm because it is not possible to blind them. The researchers conducting the study assessments will be blind to assignments. The care managers will not be blinded because it is not possible to blind them and it is necessary for them to know of a participant’s assignment to assist in troubleshooting.   Participants and care managers will be instructed not to reveal the group assignment to the member of the research team conducting assessments. Following the completion of recruitment, data analysts will be provided with the data for the arms simply labelled as “Group A” and “Group B” to avoid bias. These generic labels will be unmasked only after completion of all the planned statistical analyses described below.

Participants will be considered lost to follow up and no longer participating in the study when they do not respond to attempts at communication with the researcher for two weeks and miss an assessment visit during that window.  8. Study Intervention Discontinuation and Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal  8.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention  Discontinuation from the AKL-T01 intervention does not mean discontinuation from the study, and we will attempt to complete remaining study procedures as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in participant management is needed.  The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the collection of the post-intervention assessment data, including all cognitive tasks, functional assessments, and mood symptom scales.  8.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons: • Significant study intervention non-compliance  • If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant. • Participant lost to follow-up after several attempts to contact [CONTACT_57418]. The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded in the case report form (CRF). Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study, will not be replaced.

Statistical Considerations  12.1 Study Design/Endpoints  We will test the hypothesis that patients receiving the AKL-T01 intervention will have significantly enhanced improvement in cognition and daily functioning, relative to a waitlist control group.   1) Our primary cognitive measure will be change in performance on a Digit Symbol Matching Task from baseline (pre-intervention) to week 6 (post-intervention) in all participants randomized to the AKL-T01 intervention arm or the waitlist control arm.   2) Our primary daily functioning measure will be change in score on the NeuroQOL Cognitive Function scale from baseline (pre-intervention) to week 6 (post-intervention) in all participants randomized to the AKL-T01 intervention arm or the waitlist control arm.   We will use analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for differences in 1) Digit Symbol Matching and 2) NeuroQOL change scores across the intervention and control arms.  A secondary outcome analyses will use ANOVA to test for group differences in change in performance on the remaining cognitive tasks (Multiple Object Tracking, Digit Span Backwards, Simple RT, Choice RT, Letter Number Switch) and group differences in the WHODAS 2.0, our secondary measure of daily functioning.   We will use the Holm-Bonferroni method to correct for multiple comparisons. An intent-to-treat approach will be used in for all of the analyses above, including outcomes in participants who did not complete the intervention.   12.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate

Based on previous research conducted at our institution, we anticipate ~20% of individuals will decide not to participate after meeting eligibility criteria.  As primary analysis will utilize linear mixed models (as implemented in lme4) to examine slope of symptom change, we utilized the simr package in R (4.0) to estimate power for the specified model assuming 50 participants per study arm in 100 simulated data sets. For standardized beta coefficient corresponding to Cohen's d of ~0.4, power exceeds 88% (95% confidence interval 80.0-93.6%) for the base case, and exceeds 80% under a range of conservative assumptions, with alpha=0.[ADDRESS_662404] approximately 12 months, yielding an accrual rate of ~10 participants per month.  12.3 Stratification Factors   Not applicable.   12.4 Analysis of Endpoints  12.4.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoints  Our primary cognitive measure will be change in performance on a Digit Symbol Matching Task from baseline (pre-intervention) to week 6 (post-intervention) in all participants randomized to the intervention or control arm. Our primary daily functioning measure will be change in score on the NeuroQOL Cognitive Function scale from baseline (pre-intervention) to week 6 (post-intervention) in all participants randomized to the intervention or control arm. We will use analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for differences in Digit Symbol Matching and NeuroQOL change scores across the two arms.  12.4.[ADDRESS_662405] for group differences in change in performance on the remaining cognitive tasks (Multiple Object Tracking, Digit Span Backwards, Simple RT, Choice RT, Letter Number Switch) and group differences in the WHODAS 2.0, our secondary measure of daily functioning.   12.5 Interim Analysis  Interim analyses will be provided to Akili Interactive as requested.   12.6 Reporting and Exclusions

 Page # 28  12.6.1 Evaluation of Toxicity  Not applicable.  12.6.2 Evaluation of Response  All subjects included in the study will be assessed for response to the intervention (if they have received the intervention).    13. Adverse Event Reporting Requirements   The research team is responsible for notifying the WCM IRB of all unexpected adverse events and serious adverse events. After faxing or e-mailing the Cornell IRB reporting forms to Cornell, the Research Assistant should follow-up with an e-mail or phone call to verify that the forms were received. Additionally, copi[INVESTIGATOR_512077].  In addition to the WCM IRB, AEs, SAEs, death, protocol violations, non-compliance, suspensions and terminations will be reported to the Akili Interactive (as the industry funding partner). All reports must be made in writing to Akili. These reports should indicate that the monitoring entities (i.e., the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32397]) have been notified in accordance with the approved monitoring plan.  13.[ADDRESS_662406] medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related.   13.1.1 Investigational Agent or Device Risks (Expected Adverse Events)  We do not anticipate significant risks for our behavioral intervention beyond boredom, frustration, fatigue, and/or headaches.  13.1.[ADDRESS_662407] their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_61186]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study device must always be suspect.   o Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  o Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other 
Protocol # 20-11022977 Version Date 11/18/2022  
 Page # 29  drugs or chemicals.   o Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate. o Unlikely to be Related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). o Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].   13.1.[ADDRESS_662408]’s research chart.      13.1.4 Reporting of AE to WCM IRB  All AEs occurring on this study will be reported to the IRB according to the IRB policy, which can be accessed via the following link:  http://researchintegrity.weill.cornell.edu/forms_and_policies/forms/Immediate_Reporting_Policy.pdf.   13.1.[ADDRESS_662409]  Not applicable.  13.1.7 Reporting of Pregnancy  Not applicable.  13.2 Definition of SAE  Serious adverse event or serious suspected adverse reaction. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse 
Protocol # 20-11022977 Version Date 11/18/2022  
 Page # [ADDRESS_662410] normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such an event would include a seizure or suicide attempt requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].    13.2.1 Reporting of SAE to IRB  All SAEs occurring on this study will be reported to the IRB according to the IRB policy, which can be accessed via the following link:   http://researchintegrity.weill.cornell.edu/forms_and_policies/forms/Immediate_Reporting_Policy.pdf.   13.2.2 Reporting of SAE to FDA [For Protocols Where WCMC is the Sponsor-Investigator] Not applicable.  13.2.3 Reporting of SAE to Akili Interactive  Institution will send Akili Interactive copi[INVESTIGATOR_512078], as well as copi[INVESTIGATOR_512079], regarding any and all serious adverse events, irrespective of association with the AKL-T01 intervention in the course of the Clinical Trial, within 5 business days of such report or correspondence being sent to the IRB.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_512080].   13.3 AE/SAE Follow Up  All SAEs and AEs reported during this study will be followed until resolution or until the investigator confirms that the AE/SAE has stabilized and no more follow-up is required. This requirement indicates that follow-up may be required for some events after the subject discontinues participation from the study.   13.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow Up  The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be 
Protocol # 20-11022977 Version Date 11/18/2022  
 Page # 31  documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.   Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].   The study research assistant will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  14. Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others  14.1 Definition of Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  • Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied; • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and • Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  This definition could include an unanticipated adverse device effect, any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  14.1.2 Unanticipated Problem Reporting  The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16104]) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) and to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC)/lead principal investigator (PI). The UPI[INVESTIGATOR_57388]:  
Protocol # 20-11022977 Version Date 11/18/2022  
 Page # 32  • Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; • A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  • An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845];  • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845].  To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPI[INVESTIGATOR_57389]:    • UPI[INVESTIGATOR_57390] (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor within <insert timeline in accordance with policy> of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  • Any other UPI[INVESTIGATOR_57391]/study sponsor within <insert timeline in accordance with policy> of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  • All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within <insert timeline in accordance with policy> of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator.  An investigator will submit to the sponsor and to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) a report of any unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_662411] (21 CFR 812.150(a)(1)), A sponsor who conducts an evaluation of an unanticipated adverse device effect under 812.46(b) shall report the results of such evaluation to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to all reviewing IRB's and participating investigators within [ADDRESS_662412] as FDA requests (21 CFR 812.150(b)(1)).     15. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  Data and safety monitoring will be performed internally by [CONTACT_512100]. This is a minimal risk study. Safety including AE/SAE will be monitored by [CONTACT_512101] (Drs. Gunning, Jaywant, Kanellopoulos) on the study staff. The monitoring clinicians will review the data that will be captured will be from 1) the pre-intervention assessments; 2) mid-intervention assessments; 3) post-intervention assessments; 4) and follow-up assessments. They will also monitor for acute medical illness or change in medical status that requires admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or prevents participation in the study.  Since this is a minimal risk study, there are no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_512081], frustration, and boredom. Subjects will continue to have the right to withdraw at any time.  The monitoring entity’s comments will be submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.

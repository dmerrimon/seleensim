Study Protocol:  
Objective: To evaluate the effects of 12 -weeks of aerobic exercise training vs stretching 
(control group) on dynamic cerebral autoregulation in participants with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) stages III -I V. 
Design: This study was a r andomized controlled trial . Participants with CKD stages III -IV 
were enrolled for participation. All p articipants underwent a  baseline  assessment  of Mean 
arterial pressure -Middle cerebral artery blood velocity very low frequency phase (radians) 
and gain (cm/s/mmHg). Participants were then randomized to a 12 -week training 
intervention consisting of either aerobic exercise training or stretching (active control). The assessment of dynamic cerebral autoregulation was then repeated following the 
intervention.  
Methods: Mean arterial pressure -Middle cerebral artery blood velocity very low frequency 
phase (radians) and gain (cm/s/mmHg) were measured during repeated bouts of sit to 
stand at 0.05Hz. Mean arterial pressure was measured via ﬁnger photoplethysmography. 
Middle cerebral artery  blood velocity was measured via transcranial Doppler ultrasound. A 
transfer function analysis was performed to derive mean arterial pressure -middle cerebral 
artery blood velocity very low frequency phase (radians) and gain (cm/s/mmHg) . 
 Location:  University of North [LOCATION_007] in Denton, TX.  
Statistical Analysis P lan:  
A two -way repeated measures ANOVA (time x group was used to compare Mean arterial 
pressure -Middle cerebral artery blood velocity very low frequency phase (radians) and gain 
(cm/s/mmHg) between time points (pre vs post) and between groups (exercise vs 
stretching).

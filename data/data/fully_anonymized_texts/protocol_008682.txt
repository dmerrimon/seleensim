 A Patient -Centered  Intervention to  Improve Opi[INVESTIGATOR_288971],1 there is growing  
and appropriate concern about impacts of their use. Prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288972], including cardiovascu lar events, fractures,  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and mortality.2-7 Up to two -thirds of patients prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_288973], such as taking more medication than prescribed, obtaining  
early refills  or medication  from other s, taking  opi[INVESTIGATOR_288974],  or 
sharing with friends or family.8,9 Prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554], which includes concurrent alcohol  
abuse or illicit substance use, occurs in 10 -35% of patients with chronic pain.10 VA/DoD Clinical  
Practic e Guidelines  for patients  prescribed  chronic  opi[INVESTIGATOR_288975] (UDT) for prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288976].[ADDRESS_352375] or General and  
Under Secretary for Health additionally highlight the need to be more thorough in screening for  
adherence to prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. However, UDTs are currently administered to fewer than 25%  
of patients who initiate chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538].12 Reasons for the limited use of UDTs may  
include clinician discomfort, uncertainty about interpreting or responding to results, and lack of  
clear data  on effectiveness  of screening  to reduce  prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288977].13,14  
We propose a randomized trial of a multifaceted intervention designed to optimize a patient - 
centered approach for improving adherence to prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], “Improving the Safety of  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_288978] ( ISOT ).” Primary care clinicians and PACT (Patient  Aligned Care Team)  
nurses will be randomized to ISOT  or the control condition; patients will be nested by [CONTACT_289075]. Clinicians and PACT nurses in both groups will participate in an interactive workshop on  
reducing prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288979]. In addition, clinicians assigned to  
ISOT  will work with a nurse care manager (NCM) who will maintain a registry of enrolled  
patients, track UDT administrations and results, examine state Prescription Drug Monitoring  
Program data, monitor med ical records, and collaborate with an internist and substance abuse  
specialist to provide decision support when patients demonstrate evidence of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288980]. The NCM will also meet with intervention patients to discuss strategies fo r 
reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_288981], and to provide rationale for  
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288982]. Thus, our intervention targets system, clinician, and  
patient levels. A research goal is to enhance patient -centered pain car e and improve the quality  
of the  communication  and relationship  between  the patient  and the primary  care team  pertaining  
to this challenging topic. The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and  
acceptability of a multifaceted intervent ion (ISOT ) to enhance opi[INVESTIGATOR_288983] . 
SPECIFIC AIMS  
Aim 1: Evaluate to what extent a multifaceted intervention ( ISOT ) enhances prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288984].  
Hypothesis 1 : At [ADDRESS_352376] lower rates of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288985], as assessed via multiple methods (self -report, clinical interview, urine drug testing),  
compared  to patients  of clinicians  randomized  to the control  condition.  
Hypothesis  2: At 12 months,  ISOT  patients  will experience  fewer adverse  events (defined  in 
this proposal  to include  emergency  room  visits, overdoses,  falls, motor vehicle  accidents).  
Aim 2: Assess to what extent assignment to ISOT  impacts pain treatment -related processe s of 
care.  
Hypothesis 1 : ISOT  patients will have more modifications to clinical care documented in the  
medical  record,  including  more  frequent  UDTs  and queries  to state  prescription  drug 
3 
  
 monitoring  programs.  
Hypothesis  2: ISOT  patients  will report  greater  trust and satisfaction  with their PCP related  
to opi[INVESTIGATOR_288986], relative to patients in the control  
condition.  
Aim 3: Explore  to what extent ISOT  is associated  with changes  in pain intensity,  function,  
quality  of life, and depressive symptoms.  
Hypothesis : ISOT  patients, relative to patients in the control condition, will not experience  
worse  significant  adverse  outcomes  in pain intensity,  function,  quality  of life, or depressive  
symp toms.  
If ISOT  is effective, we will additionally examine intervention impacts on VA healthcare  
utilization and costs.  
The overall significance  of this project is to test the efficacy, satisfaction, and cost - 
effectiveness of a multifaceted patient -centered  intervention designed to enhance opi[INVESTIGATOR_288987].  
Results will inform the utility of team -based care and risk mitigation strategies for chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_288988]. If results are significant, clinicians will have a pragmatic evidence -based treatment that  
improv es adherence to prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], reduces adverse events, does not result in  
impairments,  and enhances the  clinician -patient  relationship.  
 
BACKGROUND  
The use of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288989].15 Data on  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_288990].16 Studies indicate one -half of patients prescribed  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_288991] 30% improvement  in short -term pain intensity.17,18 Less data  are 
available  on the long -term benefit  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].19,20  
Recent  statistics  are emerging  about  harms associated  with the use  of prescription  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]  – 
this includes issues of misuse, abuse, diversion, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related adverse events. Prescription  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_288992], requesting early refills, or using  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_4976] a non -prescribed purpose; this may occur in up t o two -thirds of patients prescribed  
chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538] (COT).8,9 More severe prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554], which includes  
concurrent illicit substance use and alcohol abuse, occurs in 10 -35% of patients prescribed  
COT.10,21 Concurrent use of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288993],  including  overdose,  and inhibits effective  pain treatment.23 
Common adverse effects associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_288994], nausea,  
somnolence, and vomiting23 and up to 50% of patients discontinue opi[INVESTIGATOR_288995].17,23 Patients maintained on COT may be exposed to additional adverse  
effects, including psychosocial and medical harms.24 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_288996], fractures, hypogonadism, sleep -related breathing disorders,  
and death.7 Unintentional overdose deaths quadrupled between 1999 and 2007, and in 16 U.S.  
states, more people die from prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288997].22 The 
dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_288998] a major contributing factor in adverse effects3,4,6 and recent studies  
highlighted  the relationship  between  opi[INVESTIGATOR_288999].2,5 
Attempts to Reduce Harms from Prescription Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] : Empi[INVESTIGATOR_289000] (UDT) to assess adherence and screen for  
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_289001].25-27 The 2010 Depar tment of  
Veterans Affairs Guidelines for treatment of patients prescribed COT recommend UDTs for all  
patients prior to initiating COT and periodic testing in stable patients. Increased frequency of  
UDT is recommended for patients at higher risk of abuse.11 These recommendations were  
highlighted  by [CONTACT_289076]

 Health.22 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_289002], regular UDT is uncommon. In prior research, we  
demonstrated  that 26% of VA patients prescribed COT receive a UDT in a one year period.21 
Among  patients  at higher  risk for prescription  opi[INVESTIGATOR_288977]  (such  as patients  with a substance  
use disorder), less than half receive UDT.21 These data replicate findings from other settings  
indicating  UDTs  are infrequently  used.12,28 -30 
Clinicians who routinely utilize UDT for all patients will encounter aberrant results in up to 40%  
of tests.31 Even among patients who appear compliant with COT, approximately 20% will test  
positive for an illicit drug or another non -prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480].[ADDRESS_352377] aberrant  UDT results.14 
There is a need for evidence -based treatments to reduce prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_289003]. Prior research has tested methods to reduce prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554]. These  include 
intensive specialty care services,32,33 the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_289004] (developed at  Philadelphia 
VAMC34), and a multidisciplinary disease management program.[ADDRESS_352378] with one another about prescri ption opi[INVESTIGATOR_289005]. Primary care providers (PCPs) and PACT nurses will be randomized to  
the intervention, “Improving the Safety of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_289006] ( ISOT )”, or the control group;  
patients will be nested within PCP status. All PCPs will par ticipate in a workshop on reducing  
harms and misuse of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and maintaining open communication with patients.  
PCPs and PACT nurses assigned to ISOT  will additionally collaborate with a nurse care  
manager (NCM) who will maintain a registry of enrolled patients, track UDT administrations and  
results, examine state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data, monitor medical  
records, and collaborate with an internist and substance abuse specialist to provide decision  
support when patients  demonstrate evidence of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_289007]. The NCM  
will also meet individually with enrolled participants to discuss strategies for reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_289008], preventing diversion, and providing rationale for prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_289009].  Thus,  the proposed  treatment  intervenes  at the system,  clinician,  and patient  levels.  
Our intervent ion is informed by [CONTACT_289077],36 which posits that  
interventions likely to alter clinician behaviors and result in improved patient outcomes include  
three parts: predisposing (clinician education), enabling (feedback and monitori ng), and  
reinforcing (system support) factors. Thus, the PRECEDE model indicates that system support  
and ongoing education or feedback is necessary to provide enabling and reinforcing  
components.[ADDRESS_352379] patient values and improve treatment

RESEARCH  DESIGN AND  METHODS  
Overview : We propose a randomized trial of multifaceted intervention designed to reduce  
adverse effects from prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], Improving the Safety of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_288978] (ISOT ). 
PCPs and PACT nurses will be randomized to ISOT  or control; patients will be nested by  
[CONTACT_289078]. All clinicians will participate in an educational workshop on reducing harms of  
prescript ion opi[INVESTIGATOR_289010]. Clinicians assigned to ISOT  will 
collaborate  with a nurse  care manager  (NCM)  who will maintain  a registry  of enrolled  patients,  
track UDT administrations and results, query prescription drug monitoring databases, monitor  
other  evidence  of potential  problems,  and collaborate  with expert  consultants  to provide  
decision support when patients have evidence of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_289011]. The 
NCM  will also have  a one-time appointment  with patients  to discuss  methods  to reduce  opi[INVESTIGATOR_289008], prevent misuse and diversion, and provide rationale for prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_289012]. The study will be conducted in the primary care clinics of the VA 
Portland  Health Care System (VAPORHCS). A maximum of [ADDRESS_352382] nurses , and 
350 patients  will participate. We will randomize by [CONTACT_289079]. We will recruit participants who are currently prescribed chronic 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_218328]  (defined  below).  Outcomes  will be measure d 6 and 12 months  after enrollment.  
Summary of the Intervention : ISOT  is based on the Chronic Illness Model,69 opi[INVESTIGATOR_289013],11,16 and recent empi[INVESTIGATOR_48718]14,48. It is  designed to optimize approaches  for 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288982], increase and  support response when patients abuse 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and reduce adverse effects, all within a patient - centered context. Reducing harms from 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_289014] a  multipronged ap proach.16,25,43 ISOT ’s 
effectiveness will be enhanced by [CONTACT_289080], clinicians, and the medical system. 
The chronic illness model enhances productive  collaboration between patients and clinicians 
via education and activation, information sy stems  changes, care management, and decision 
support.69 This model has been effective in treating  diverse chronic  health  conditions.44-48 
Study Eligibility : Clinicians : All PCPs and their PACT nurse at the VAPORHCS will be eligible  
(~n=80 PCPs and ~n=80 nurses). In order for a PACT nurse to participate, the PCP s/he is  
6 
04/24/[ADDRESS_352383] also participate. Patients : All patients enrolled in primary care  
clinics w ill be potentially eligible.  
Inclusion Criteria : Participants must be enrolled in primary care at the VAPORHCS and be  
receiving chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_289015] a life -limiting disease. Chronic  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_289016] a current prescription.20 The only other inclusion criterion is the  
ability to  read and write  in English.  Exclusion  Criteria : Age younger  than [ADDRESS_352384]  a 
waiver of informed consent, to access clinical diagnostic and pharmacy data. These data will be  
obtained for VA patients from the Corporate Data Warehouse, which will be accessed and  
analyzed  within the  secure user -restricted  VINCI  study  site workspace.  
Recruitment : Clinicians : PCPs and PACT nurses will be recruited through email, discussions at  
practice meetings (the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a member of the research team will make a presentation during a  
weekly staff meeting and/or during the monthly meeting for all PCPs), a nd direct contact [CONTACT_289081]. Patients : We will ask participating PCPs for permission to recruit patients. Using  
data from the electronic medical record, we will identify patients at the VAPORHCS who  
potentially meet our inclusion/exclusion crite ria. Consistent with the VAPORHCS’s policy on  
recruiting participants for research studies, we will include a signed letter from the clinic  
manager where the patient receives his/her primary care, or director of primary care. The  
information sent to patien ts will include an accompanying letter from the research team, which  
will describe  the study  and invite  patients  to participate in  a telephone  screening  session.  
Patients will be asked to return enclosed addressed and stamped letters, or to call our research  
office telephone number if interested in being screened.  
 
During  the screening  telephone  call, the study  research  assistant  will provide  a brief overview  of 
the study purpose (including clear statements that participation involves research and  
participation does not provide clinical treatment), review inclusion/exclusion criteria, describe  
what participation in the study would entail, and s chedule participants for a study appointment  
session. If the patient is interested in participating and eligible, the patient will be scheduled for  
a baseline assessment (participants will also receive reminder phone calls and/or letters prior 
to their sch eduled appointment). To enhance the likelihood of participants attending the study  
evaluation session, we will offer a $50 payment in compensation for time and/or travel to attend  
the research visit. The baseline assessment and all follow -up evaluations wi ll be conducted  
either  in person  or via telephone.  
 
During the telephone screening visit, if the participant is ineligible, but is interested in receiving  
additional clinical services, s/he will be referred to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_289017].  
 
During the assessment sessions, the research assistant will provide another overview of study  
participation, administer infor med consent and HIPAA authorization, and instruct the participant  
to complete  study  measures.   
 
Follow -up: In addition to the baseline assessment, all participants will complete follow -up 
assessments every 6 months. During these research visits, participants will complete all study  
measures (described below). Research visits must be completed within 1  month of the 
scheduled follow -ups (i.e.,  the [ADDRESS_352385]  be completed between 11 -13 months  from 
baseline).

04/24/2019   
 Randomization : We will randomize by [CONTACT_200808]; patients will be assigned to intervention or control  
based on randomization of their PCP and PACT nurse. At the VAPORHCS, each PACT nurse is  
assigned to a single PCP and each PCP has one PACT nurse. Thus, contamination effects b y 
PACT  nurses  working  with a PCP assigned  to the control  condition  will not  be a concern.  
We will randomize dyads of PCPs and PACT nurses to receive ISOT  versus control. We will  
initially recruit PCPs to participate. Of the PCPs who choose to enroll, we wi ll then attempt to  
recruit the PACT nurse who is assigned with that PCP (if the PACT nurse chooses not to  
participate, the consenting PCP will remain eligible). We will randomly assign consenting PCPs  
and their PACT nurse (if they choose to participate) to  receive ISOT  versus control after  
stratifying by [CONTACT_289082] (physician versus nurse practitioner/physician assistant) and  
proportion of patients in PCP’s panel receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155] (high vs low, based on  
median eligible clinician popul ation). Using a permuted block randomization and maximizing the  
number of PCPs (clusters) should prevent major uneven distribution of caseload size and  
unmeasured confounders across the arms and increase precision.72 The statistician will perform  
the rando mization prior to patient recruitment. Research assistants will be blind to intervention  
status  of patients  and clinicians.  
ISOT  Team and Training : ISOT  is a multifaceted intervention. The individual components of  
ISOT  have been adapted from recommendations made as part of clinical practice  
guidelines11,16, our preliminary studies, and prior experience in conducting multifaceted  
intervention  studies  in primary  care.48,[ADDRESS_352386]  of this intervention  is its integration  
of different treatment recommendations into a single package. This method of treatment  
development and  adaptation  is similar  to other  effective  multifaceted  interventions.73 
A research nurse care manager (NCM) will be hire d to participate in this study. The NCM will be  
employed full -time. S/he will have clinical training as a registered nurse (R.N.) and have a  
clinical  background  in chronic  disease  management  and outpatient  treatment.  The individual will  
receive extensive training in chronic pain management, prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288987], and research  
procedures . 
ISOT  Intervention  Components   
Clinician  Education and Activation : 
a. [CONTACT_289090] (Co -Investigator) who has expertise in chronic pain treatment, screening for  
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_289018], and patient -centered care, will conduct the interactive  
workshop for PCPs and PACT nurses. She has experience providing trainings on this top ic. 
Workshop goals will be designed to optimize clinician interactions via education and  
activation, while providing system support. We will educate clinicians about prescription  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_288982], screening for adverse effects, and enhancing pat ient-centered  
care, with a focus on enhancing shared decision making.74,75 Clinical recommendations for  
modifying care in instances of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]/abuse will be based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732].[ADDRESS_352387] ([CONTACT_289091]) and substance abuse specialist ([CONTACT_289092]) will  
provide consultation to [CONTACT_289093] in the development of the training workshop and help  
facilita te role -play components of the training. They will also consult with the NCM throughout  
8 
04/24/2019   
 the intervention as needed.  
d. The NCM will monitor medical records for all enrolled participants to examine potential opi[INVESTIGATOR_289019]-adherence behaviors (e.g., lost prescriptions, early refills, multiple providers, seeking  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_289020]). For patients with prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554], the NCM will offer decision  
support to PCPs about treatment options. The NCM will also follow -up to ensure successful  
implementation  of changes  in the  treatment  plan.  
e. Because there is variation in how clinicians approach preventing harms from opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], ISOT  
will take a flexible approach to accommodate clinician preferences; we will collect information  
about PACT team preferences for communication with the intervention team and opi[INVESTIGATOR_289021].[ADDRESS_352388] team member in a manner consistent with preferences (i.e.,  
discussion,  chart  note,  secure email,  voicemail message,  etc.).  
f. An email list serve (using encryption and within security firewall), managed by [CONTACT_289083], will be used to communicate information and  
facilitate dialogue among intervention clinicians. In our prior research, clinicians appreciated  
the opportunity  to discuss (non -identifying)  patient  management  strategies.  
Patient Assessment  and Activation : 
a. The NCM will perform a chart review of each ISOT  patient and schedule a one -time 
appointment.  
b. With each  patient,  the NCM  will review  strategies  for increasing  opi[INVESTIGATOR_289022] s 
adverse effects of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], including overdose, falls, interactions with 
other  medications or alcohol/illicit substances, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351]. The NCM 
and patient will  discuss treatment goals, options, and self -management 
approaches. Supplem ental written  materials will describe risks and benefits of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. With PCP authorization, the NCM will  facilitate completion of  opi[INVESTIGATOR_289023],  as needed.  
c. The NCM will talk with patients about the rationale behind screening for adherence  to 
prescription  opi[INVESTIGATOR_289024],  and focus  on patient safety  and risk-benefit of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].76 
d. Patients will receive information about common ways in which opi[INVESTIGATOR_289025] (e.g.,  
taken  by [CONTACT_289084], loaning  to others)  and potential  harms  associated  with diversion.  
Recommendations will be provided about methods for limiting opi[INVESTIGATOR_289026], including  
details about  medication  take-back  programs.  
e. Patients will be provided with an easy -to-read brochure that describes adverse effects of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], methods for reducing the likelihood of adverse events, rationale for prescription  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_289027],  and strategies  for preventing diversion.  
System  Assessment  and Intervention : 
a. The NCM will maintain a registry of all enrolled patients and track UDT administrations. For  
patients that have not been administered a UDT in [ADDRESS_352389] -year check. (In Oregon,  
only prescribers are authorized to check PDMP data, so the NCM could not query the  
database him/herse lf.) PDMP checks are recorded in the medical record, so the research  
team will be able to track frequencies. If requested, the NCM may collaborate with pharmacy  
services  to query  state PDMP databases.  
c. The NCM will provide support about methods for talki ng with patients about prescription  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_289028].  This will include  providing written  information, such  as scripts  
that clinicians can follow. In pi[INVESTIGATOR_287327], PCPs requested these types of materials to  
assist  with improving adherence  to opi[INVESTIGATOR_289029].  
d. The NCM will track all UDTs, notify the PCP of the results, and provide recommendations  
9 
04/24/2019   
 04/24/[ADDRESS_352390] not been  
addressed.  
Follow -up: Participants will complete assessments at baseline, [ADDRESS_352391] their  
position at the Portland VA. Clinical patients who are “attached” with these clinicians and  
already enrolled in the study will remain eligible to participate. Clin ical recommendations that  
are made  regarding  patient’s  care will continue  to be forwarded  to PACT  team  members  who 
remain  involved in each  patient’s  treatment.  
 
Participants will also be reimbursed for their participation. This includes a $50 payment for each  
of the three research visits. This reimbursement amount is intended to cover time to complete  
the research visit and/or costs of travel to and from the hospi [INVESTIGATOR_289030]. This payment  
amount is consistent with other research studies of similar duration and intensity and do not  
appear to put undue pressure on prospective subjects to participate. The payment amount and  
terms of  payment  are specified  in the  consent  form.  
Study Measures: Research staff collecting outcome data will be blinded to participant and  
clinician  intervention  status.  The ISOT  intervention  team  will not have  access  to data obtained  
by [CONTACT_827],  except  if a patient’s  safety  becomes  a concern.  
 
Measures of Prescription Opi[INVESTIGATOR_289031]/Abuse (Aim 1 ): The primary outcome will be responses  
to the Current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_85581] (COMM), a [ADDRESS_352392] individuals at risk of opio id misuse and abuse.80 The COMM has  
been  well-validated81 and previously  used  in treatment  outcome  studies.  33 The COMM  has 
also been validated for detecting prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_289032] -off scores > 13.82 The 
Timeli ne Followback  (TLFB; Sobell & Sobell, 1992) is a frequently used assessment method  
that uses calendar prompts to elicit frequency and intensity of substance use within a specific  
timeframe. The TLFB has demonstrated good test -retest reliability and validit y for assessing  
multiple substances at one time (Ehrman & Robbins, 1994; Fals -Stewart et al., 2000). This  
study will assess use of alcohol, marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, opi[INVESTIGATOR_289033],  and other  prescription  medications in the past 30 days. The  Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM -IV (SCID) will be used to assess current  alcohol and substance use  
disorders.83 The Overdose Risk Behavior (ORB)  questionnaire  is a newly -developed  14-item 
self-report measure that  assesses  behaviors  and activities  that place an individual at higher 
risk of accidental  overdose  to prescription  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  Participants will  complete  Urine Drug 
Tests , to evaluate for the  presence of substances ingested by  [CONTACT_4317]. UDTs will 
evaluate f or cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], barbiturates,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]. Confirmatory  testing  will be  conducted  for all  UDT screens with unexpected results.  
The purpose of UDT is to have  confirmation of certain prescribed and  illicit substances  that 
have  been  ingested by [CONTACT_19288].  Research staff will review medical  record  data 
prior to research  visits  to confirm medication stat us. Participants will be asked to validate 
pharmacy data about  prescription  status,  as well as  medications  prescribed outside VA.  
10 
04/24/2019   
 Measures of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Related Adverse Events (Aim 1) : Prior to appointments, research staff will  
review medical record data for participants to track adverse effects. This includes emergency  
room visits, falls, and overdoses. Participants will also be queried about these effects and motor  
vehicle  accidents  at each research visit.  
 
Processes of Care Measures (Aim 2) : At the conclusion of each patient’s participation, we will  
extract medical record data on treatment received. This will include data in the year prior to  
treatment and the year during treatment on number of urine drug tests  administered as part of  
clinical care and queries to state prescription drug monitoring programs . Results from UDT s 
administered as part of clinical will be extracted from VA laboratory data. For PDMP data,  
clinicians must provide documentation in the medical record when they check PDMP data;  
research staff will review medical record data of enrolled participants to e valuate incidence and  
frequency of PDMP checks. For patients with documented prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554], research  
staff will evaluate any potential changes in care that occurred following detection of prescription  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_288977],  including  referrals  to the substance  abuse  treatment  program,  mental  health  
clinic, or specialty pain service; follow -up monitoring; and treatment changes (such as change in  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_289034],  cessation  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],  etc.).  
➢ Although the research team will monitor UDTs administered in c linical practice, these data  
will not  be used as outcome to reflect prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554]. UDTs will also be  
administered by [CONTACT_289085]. These UDTs  
will be ordered under a unique study identificat ion number. Patient identifying information will  
never be attached  to or associated with these  research UDT  sample.  
Measures of the Clinician -Patient Relationship (Aim 2) : Trust in one’s clinician will be examined  
with the Trust in Physician Scale , an [ADDRESS_352393] Scale is a recently -developed 5 -item self - 
report measure that evaluates patients’ perceptions of their relationship with their primary care  
provider.  
Clinicia n Data (Aim 2) : At baseline and [ADDRESS_352394] ed their  
relationships with patients, and their encounters with patients prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (see Appendix  
II for the questionnaire,  which is based on  our prior research48). 
Measures of  Pain,  Function,  and Quality  of Life (Aim 3) : The Chronic  Pain Grade  (CPG)  will be used 
to assess pain intensity and function. The CPG is a commonly used and well -validated  measure that 
provides global scores of pain intensity and function.88,89 Quality of life will be  measured with the 
Veterans R AND 12 -Item Health Survey (VR -12),90 a 12-item well -validated  self-report measure of 
quality of life that is sensitive to changes in veterans and has been used  in numerous epi[INVESTIGATOR_34207]. The Patient Health Questionnaire  (PHQ), a brief and  psychom etrically valid measure, will be 
used to assess depressive symptoms.91,92 The Generalized Anxiety Disorder -7 (GAD -7) Scale  is a 
self-report measure designed to assess the  severity of anxiety symptoms, and has been validated as 
a robust predictor of the dif ferent  anxiety disorders (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], Kroenke, & Williams, 1992; Kroenke, 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], Williams, Monahan, &  Lowe, 2007). Side effects from opi[INVESTIGATOR_289035] .93 
Basic demographic characteristics  that will be assessed include age, gender, race, ethnicity,  
marital status, employment, socioeconomic status, disability status, and VA service -connection.  
11 
04/24/[ADDRESS_352395] (e.g.,  physical therapy, surgery,  
osteopathic manipulation, acupuncture, etc.) and self -report (non -pharmacological interventions,  
complementary and alternative medicine approaches to pain140). Text data obtained from notes  
in the clinical record may also be rev iewed, in order to conduct analyses of natural language  
processing. Based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_289036], we anticipate that all of the above  
questionnaires  will be completed  by [CONTACT_289086] 60 minutes.  
Data  Analysis  
Before analyses are cond ucted, data will be audited for quality, including missing data patterns  
and evaluation of distributions with reference to planned models. The evaluation of distributions  
includes the detection of outliers and checking distributions of variables to ensure they meet the  
assumptions of planned analyses. Power calculations (below) are based on comparisons that  
account for data clustering. The analyses will incorporate covariate information, in particular  
baseline data on age, gender, depressive symptoms, histo ry of substance use disorder (SUD),  
and pain intensity, which will enhance power. Analyses will be conducted with all enrolled  
participants  regardless of  attrition  (intent -to-treat).  
Management of Missing Data: The pattern of missingness will be examined a nd baseline  
responses compared between those with and without missing data. Variables related to  
missingness will be included in the analyses which should yield valid inferences.94 We will  
complete  sensitivity  analyses  comparing  the main  analyses  results  with results  from analyses  
with completers  only and based on  multiple imputation.  
Aim 1: Evaluate to what extent a multifaceted intervention ( ISOT ) enhances prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_288984] . For Aim 1, we use 8.[ADDRESS_352396] deviation (SD) f or change in COMM  
score from baseline to 12 months.95 This SD estimate is based on SD’s in prior intervention  
research.33 For each group, an estimated SD for change was obtained using the two SD’s and a  
within -subject intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.5. Averaging the corresponding variances  
leads to an estimated variance of 78 (SD=8.9). Power calculations were performed based on 28  
or 32 (we may recruit as many as 40 PCPs, but do not anticipate that many will consent to  
participate) clinicians per in tervention group and [ADDRESS_352397] small differences (able to detect < ½ SD change) in COMM score. For Aim 1, we plan to  
conduct analyses for self -report data (COMM), clinical interviews to assess current substance  
use disorders (SCID), and results from research -administered UDTs. With n=320, [ADDRESS_352398] statistical power greater than 80% to detect  
differences  in percentages between  groups  of about 20%  for binary  outcomes  from the SCID  
and UDT (see  Table 2  below  for similar  calculations  for Aim 2).

0.10 3.9 3.6 3.6 3.4 
Analyses for Aim 1 : For comparison of mean COMM change between groups, we will use mixed  
longitudinal models with a random effect for PCP and patient, to allow for correlation between  
12 
04/24/[ADDRESS_352399] for baseline  
COMM score and the stratification variables: PCP training type (MD/DO vs NP or PA) and  
proportion of clinician panel prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (high vs low). In addition to testing formal  
hypotheses, we will report 95% confide nce intervals for the differences in mean outcomes  
between groups at 6 and 12 months. For comparing the percentages classified as abusing  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_289037] -up (combining information from 6 and 12 months) based on  
SCID and UDT, we will use g eneralized -linear mixed models (or GEE as needed) to incorporate  
correlation between patients of the same PCP. We will adjust for baseline measures of the  
outcome along with the covariates listed above. We will report group comparisons on all three  
primary  outcomes (COMM, SCID, and UDT). Assuming 15% of the sample has current SUD  
(consistent with other research), we will not conduct interaction analyses, but will present  
descriptive information for each outcome (COMM, SCID, UDT) on treatment outcomes by [CONTACT_289087].  
Data on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related adverse events will be obtained from the medical record and participant  
self-report. We will collect data on opi[INVESTIGATOR_75178], falls, motor vehicle accidents, and ER visits  
related to pain. Descriptive information on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related events will be provided for each group  
(numbers and percentages of participants with each event) . Because the number of adverse  
events is expected to be small, we will use Fisher’s Exact test to compare adverse event  
percentages between groups. We will compare both percentages for each individual type of  
event as  well as percentages  of individuals  experiencing  any adverse event between  groups.  
Aim 2: Assess to what extent assignment to ISOT  impacts pain treatment -related processes of  
care. The power for comparing the  percentage of patients receiving at least one UDT (Table 2)  
during the follow -up period assumes that 40% of patients in the control group will receive a  
follow -up UDT.21 This is based on prior research in which 26% of patients had a UDT and our  
expectatio n that the percentage will be higher in the control group after clinicians participate in  
the workshop. We hypothesize that clinicians randomized to ISOT  will have much higher rates  
of administering UDTs. Regarding checks to state PDMPs, currently 3 -5% of VAPORHCS  
patients receive a query. The ISOT  protocol prompts the clinician to conduct PDMP queries and  
we expect dramatic differences in percentages between the two intervention groups. We have  
80% power to detect differences of 17 -21% on binary outcomes. Here we expect differences to  
be much  greater.

Aim 2: Assess to what extent assignment to ISOT  impacts the quality of the clinician -patient  
relationship . Using estimated  standard  deviations  of 14.[ADDRESS_352403] in  Physician  Scale84 and 
13 
04/24/[ADDRESS_352404] 80% power at level 0.[ADDRESS_352405] 80% power to detect differences of 0.50 to 0.53 SDs i n mean summary scores  
between  intervention  groups.  
Analyses for Aim 2 : We will use GEE methods to compare between intervention groups the  
average  numbers  of clinical  care documentations,  UDT’s,  and queries  to state  prescription  drug 
monitoring programs while adjusting for the baseline covariates (age, gender, depressive  
symptoms, history of SUD, and pain intensity) and the stratification variables. For patient level  
data, the approach for analysis of Aim 2 outcomes will be the same as  that for Aim 1, using  
mixed models and/or GEE for comparisons, while adjusting for baseline covariates (age, sex,  
depressive symptoms, history of SUD, and pain severity), baseline measure of the outcome,  
and stratification variables (training type, propor tion of panel prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]). Analyses will  
be conducted for scores on the Trust in Physician scale and Participatory Decision Making  
Style.  
For clinician and PACT nurse data on barriers to use of UDTs, we will report descriptive  
information for each of the 10 questions. For each group and question, we will report the  
percentage of clinicians with scores at each of the five levels at baseline and follow -up, as well  
as the corresponding descriptive change information in follow -up scores. We will report the 
mean (and SD, min, max) of change for each question. We will obtain an overall survey score,  
by [CONTACT_113116] 10 question scores for each clinician and report the mean (and SD, min, max)  
survey score for each group at baseline and follow -up, along with  the mean change (and SD,  
min, max) in survey score.  We will use linear mixed models on the change scores to compare  
groups, while adjusting for clinician age, clinician training type, sex, panel size, summary survey  
score at baseline, and stratification v ariables. We will include a random pair effect to allow for  
correlation between the PCP and PACT nurse within each pair. P -values and 95% confidence  
intervals for the differences between groups in change scores will be provided. Similar analyses  
will be co nducted  for examining survey  data on clinician satisfaction  with ISOT . 
Aim 3: Explore  to what extent ISOT  is associated  with changes  in pain intensity,  function,  quality  
of life, and depressive symptoms . Our goal is to improve  opi[INVESTIGATOR_289038] y 
impacting pain or quality of life. Power calculations were performed for pain intensity based on  
28 or 32 clinicians per intervention group and 4 -5 patients per clinician, using data indicating a  
baseline mean pain intens ity score of 66 and estimated SD of change from baseline of 13.1.48 
Here we are interested in tests of non -inferiority; specifically we aim to show that the reduction  
in mean pain intensity for the ISOT  group is no more than one -half standard deviation les s than  
that for the control group. Considering the same set of conditions given in Tables [ADDRESS_352406]  
case scenario (n=4 patients per clinician, n=28 clinicians per intervention and intraclass  
correlation of 0.10), results in power greater than 80% at level 0.[ADDRESS_352407] power greater than 80% at level 0.025 for testing non -inferiority, if  
the mean change in function, q uality of life, and depressive symptoms for the ISOT  group are  no 
more than 1.8, 0.9, and 0.4 units, respectively, less than those for the control group. These  are 
based on estimated SD’s for change assuming a 0.5 correlation between baseline and  follow -

 up. 
Analyses for Aim 3 : For analysis of pain intensity, we hypothesize that the mean reduction in  
pain (measured  by [CONTACT_289088])  for patients  randomized to  ISOT  is no more  than 
6.[ADDRESS_352408] of this non -inferiority  
hypothesis, our primary goal is to estimate the difference in mean reductions between the  
groups  at each  time-point,  anticipating  that the differences  will be small. Construction  of a lower  
bound (97.5%) corresponds specifically to the non -inferiority hypothesis of interest, but we will  
also obtain the corresponding (97.5%) upper bound. As with comparison of continuous  
outcomes for the other aims, mixed models will be used for hypothesis test ing and confidence  
interval construction and we will adjust for covariates measured at baseline (patient age, sex,  
depressive symptoms, history of SUD, and pain severity), stratification variables, and baseline  
score. We will use the same approach to exami ne potential differences between groups on  
measures  of pain-related  function,  quality  of life, and depressive symptoms.

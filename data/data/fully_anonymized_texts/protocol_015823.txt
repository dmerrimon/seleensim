Short  Title:  SmokefreeSGM  
GENERAL INFORMATION 
Smoki
ng among sexual and gender minority (SGM) groups, which include lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
transgender (LGBT) individuals, has been reported from different sources as highly prevalent (46% for gay 
men and 48% for lesbians). Considering that the smoking rate within SGM groups is more than double that of the general population (19%) and that smoking accounts for at least 30% of all cancer deaths, it is clear that 
there is an increased risk for SGM individuals to suffer from this fatal condition. Text messaging programs are 
effective for smoking cessation and other health behaviors. They are appealing to traditionally hard -to-reach, 
at-risk populations who experience barriers to smoking cessation interventions, and who have high rates of 
mobile phone and text messaging use, which is the case for SGM users. SmokefreeTXT is a smoking cessation intervention that sends tailored, supportive texts to users based on self -selected smoking quit date. 
Although this program developed by [CONTACT_290859] (NCI) has been successfully evaluated with the general population, no study has evaluated its feasibility specifically among SGM smokers. This protocol proposes 3 specific aims or parts:

(2) To pretest  the design  of SmokefreeSGM  through a mixed -methods  approach among 30 SGM  adult 
smokers; and 
(3) To examine recruitment, retention, and smoking abstinence rates at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow -up 
among 80 SGM  smokers  randomized to either  the original  SmokefreeTXT or SmokefreeSGM  program  arms. 
Engagement with the programs will be also measured by [CONTACT_290860]. Additionally, we will use mixed- methods research among 
32 SGM smokers completing their participation in the  feasibility trial to better understand study participants’ 
acceptability of the cessation interventions. Results will contribute to reducing tobacco -related health 
disparities among SGM  groups.  
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 
Cigarette smoking among SGM groups in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is higher than among heterosexual/straight individuals. Nearly 1 in 4 SGM adults smoke cigarettes compared with about 1 in 6 heterosexual/straight adults
.[ADDRESS_354838] concentration 
of same -sex couples in the US, behind only [LOCATION_004] and [LOCATION_001].4 Our study involving attendees of the 
2014 Houston Pride Parade and Festival confirmed the alarmingly  high prevalence of cigarette smoking in 
this vulnerable group (55%).[ADDRESS_354839] 30% of all cancer deaths,6 it is 
clear that there is an increased risk for SGM individuals to die of tobacco- related conditions, including 
cancer. It has been suggested that targeted and tailored interventions could be more effective among SGM smokers because they assure a safe, validating environment that enhances receptivity to cessation.
7,8 The 
few reported smoking cessation interventions  for SGM smokers are minimally tailored, lack a control group, 
lack objective verification of self -reported quit rates, and/or are based on group interventions.9-12 Mobile 
health (mHealth) programs that use text messaging are effective for smoking cessation and other health behaviors.
13-[ADDRESS_354840] high rates of mobile phone and text messaging use.19 Although 
the number of people enrolled in text messaging programs for smoking cessation is increasing, no study 
has been conducted for evaluating its feasibility among SGM smokers. SmokefreeTXT is an automated, personalized, and interactive mHealth program for smoking cessation developed by [CONTACT_290861] 2 weeks before and up to 6 weeks after the quit date. Its efficacy was successfully evaluated with the general population in a randomized trial.
15,20,21 However, theoretically -based smoking cessation 
treatments delivered via text messaging and focused on enhancing treatment engagement and targeting 
the specific needs of SGM smokers  are needed.  IRB NUMBER:  HSC -SPH-20-0318

OBJECTIVE  
 
The overall objective of the study is to develop SmokefreeSGM, a version of SmokefreeTXT that will be 
tailored and tested among  SGM  smokers.  This protocol  proposes  3 aims,  each of them  corresponding to 
Parts 1, 2, and 3 in this research study:  
▪ Aim 1: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_290855] (Part  1). 
▪ Aim 2: Pretesting the design of SmokefreeSGM among 30 smokers (Part  2). 
▪ Aim 3: Feasibility trial to examine recruitment, retention, and smoking abstinence rates 
among  SGM  smokers.  We will also assess program  engagement  and acceptability  among 
SGM smokers w ho participated in the feasibility trial (Part  3). 
 
NOTE: We are still enrolling study participants for all research activities related to Aim 2 (Pretesting). With 
this protocol amendment, we are seeking IRB approval to increase the sample size from [ADDRESS_354841] the feasibility of a 
personalized, interactive text -based smoking cessation program (SmokefreeSGM) specifically 
designed for SGM smokers. Ninety -six SGM smokers will be recruited for the entire study 
(n=96).  
 
 
 
RESEARCH METHODS FOR PART 1  
Procedures: In part 1, we will develop SmokefreeSGM, an SGM -tailored version of SmokefreeTXT, 
a text -based smoking cessation program for smoking cessation. SmokefreeTXT is an automated, 
personalized, and interactive mHealth program that sends bidirectional text messages timed 
around a participant’s quit date over [ADDRESS_354842] not quit are routed into setting 
a new quit date. After enrollment, SmokefreeTXT offers both outgoing messages about quitting smoking and on- demand help through the use of keywords. Short Message Service (SMS) 
keywords  include among others:  CRAVE  (study  participants will get help with a craving by [CONTACT_7661] a

encouragement to get back on track), and SMOKEFREE STATUS (which indicates if the study participant has smoked or not by [CONTACT_290862]/she receives the text message). 
 
Smok efreeSGM will be developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tami -Maury’s research team with input and feedback 
from members of a Community Advisory Committee (CAB) composed of smoking cessation specialists, SGM former and current smokers, as well as scientists and community leaders  with 
whom we have teamed up in previous research and advocacy efforts around SGM health disparities research. These CAB members should not be considered research participants. They 
will only provide feedback on the content and design of the SGM -tailored t ext-based platform. The 
CAB members will be compensated for completing a two- part survey ($[ADDRESS_354843] after 
completing each part). Further, we will solicit meetings with CAB members either individually or in 
a group via a telehealth platform (i.e., Zoom  or Webex). After each meeting, which won’t last more 
than 60 minutes, CAB members will receive a $[ADDRESS_354844] anticipated for SmokefreeSGM:  
o Messages originated from SmokefreeSGM will be sent by a fictitious peer ex -smoker SGM quit 
coach (Alex) who will offer evidence -based advice on quitting.  
o The characteristics of, and messages sent by, the role model (Alex) will be based on real -life 
experiences of SGM ex -smokers who understand user’s barriers and creates a welcoming 
environment.  
o Modifying and tailoring of the NCI SmokefreeTXT text library (Appendix A) by [CONTACT_1583] 70 
encouragement  and motivational  messages  that address  unique  psychosocial stressors for SGM 
smokers  such as elevated general  stress (i.e., level of stress  and number  of stressful  life events) 
and minority specific stress (i.e., internalized homophobia, sexual orientation concealment, 
discrimination events, stigma consciousness). The new keyword STRESS will prompt the 
additional set of text  messages.

will be beta -tested by 30 SGM adult smokers for 2 weeks before and 4 weeks after the quit 
date. Then, beta users will participate in individual interviews. The feedback provided by 
[CONTACT_290863]. Their thoughts and feedback will be critical for 
driving technical improvements of SmokefreeSGM’s concept, design, and functionality 
before launching it during the feasibility trial (Part 3) targeting SGM smokers who have not participated in the above -mentioned beta -test. 
 
Inclusion Criteria.  
 
1) Self-identified as a lesbian,  gay, or bisexual  individual  
 
2) Age ≥ 18 years  
 
3) Smoke five or more cigarettes per day, has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their 
lifetime and smokes  everyday  
4) Have  an interest  in quitting smoking in the next 15 days  
 
5) Have  a cellphone number  with an unlimited  short  messaging service (SMS) 
plan 
6) Have US mailing and email  addresses  
 
7) Positive cotinine saliva test results for current smoker  status  
 
 
Exclusion criteria. 
 
1) Individuals who are found to have a prepaid cell phone (GoPhone or pay -as- 
you-go plan) will be excluded,  
2) Individuals  who are found to have a cellphone number  that does  not work  or is 
registered to someone else will be disqualified,  
3) Pregnant or breastfeeding women (nicotine patches are not generally 
recommended to this group as nicotine  can affect  fetal and neonatal  brain 
development),  
4) Contraindication for nicotine patch. Absolute contraindications included:  severe

liver,  kidney  or heart  disease.  Participants  reporting an absolute contraindication are 
ineligible  for the study.  A participant  reporting a potential  contraindication  will require 
that his/her primary care provider and/or other treating physician (e.g.  psychiatrist) 
approve the nicotine patches. If the request is denied or not returned in two weeks, 
potential participants will be excluded from the  study; 
5) Current  use of tobacco  cessation medications;  
 
6) Enrolled in another smoking cessation study;  
 
7) Non-English  speakers.  Although we recognize that excluding Spanish speakers 
(Hispanics represent 44% of the total population in Houston)24 limits  the 
potential generalizability and reach of our text- based smoking cessation program. 
We do not believe that developi[INVESTIGATOR_290856] - tailored intervention in 2 
languages is feasible within the scope of this study. 
8) Having  inadequate equipment/device (i.e., webcam,  speakers,  mic) for 
participating in telehealth sessions via Webex or Zoom AND cannot 
meet for an in- person screening.  
 
Study Procedures.  
 
Once developed, SmokefreeSGM will be beta -tested by 30 SGM adult smokers for a period 
of 2 weeks before and 4 weeks after their quit date.  
 
Recruitment procedures.  Active efforts will be made to identify subjects who are suitable for 
enrollment into this part of the study. Flyers (Appendix B) offering help to SGM individuals 
interested in quitting smoking will be distributed at local community organizations and healthcare facilities working for SGM groups.  We will also advertise the flyer at local 
newspapers, magazines, webpages, social media sites of local community organizations and healthcare facilities, and SGM -venues (e.g., bars, restaurants, etc.).  
Interested individuals will contact [CONTACT_3476]. The screening process will take place over 
the phone or through telehealth (e.g., Webex or a similar platform), or in person, and is divided 
into two parts. Part A of the screening (conducted over the phone, in person, or through telehealth) collects demogr aphic information inaddition to an assessment of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (Appendix C). Participants who areeligible to participate in the study will be invited to complete part B of the screen (through telehealth, or in person) at a later date/tim e where self -reported smoking status will be verified by [CONTACT_194739]. Informed consent will be

 delivered electronically to participants via email after they complete part A of the screening and 
schedule their part B screen (Appendix D). In order to avoid in -person visits, the self -reported 
smoking status will be objectively verified by [CONTACT_290864]  (either Alere or NICDetect) during 
screening part B (Appendix E). However in- person visits will be conducted in the circumstances 
that videoconferencing technology or other barriers exist for screening. Potential study participants will be mailed in advance a saliva cotinine test with instructions (delivered electronically), or provided the test in -person. During part B of the screening process, 
participants will conduct the test at home or in person following the step -by-step instructions 
provided by [CONTACT_16133]. The test result will be available when the colored band appears, which takes around [ADDRESS_354847] strip during the telehealth session or to the researcher in person. After enrolling into the study, participants will receive a 4- week 
supply of nicotine patches (NicodermCQ or CVS Health) that will be mailed to their physical address.  
 
Baseline assessment. Immediately after confirming their eligibility and enrolling the 
participant  into the study,  additional questions  will be asked  to complete  the baseline 
assessment. 
Quantitative Measures. The following data will be collected: contact [CONTACT_3031] (name, 
email address, phone number), demographic (race/ethnicity, work status, education, marital status, number of children in household), and smoking characteris tics of 
participants (e.g., how many smokers in the household, cigarettes smoked/day, past quit attempts, age of first cigarette use). Nicotine dependence will be measured with the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) at baseline. The FTND is a 
standard instrument for assessing the intensity of physical addiction to nicotine. The 
test was designed to provide an ordinal measure of nicotine dependence related to cigarette smoking. It contains six questions that evaluate the quantity of cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and dependence. In scoring the FTND, yes/no items are scored from 0 to 1 and multiple- choice items are scored from 0 to 3. The 
items are summed to yield a total score of 0- 10. The higher the total FTND score, the 
more intense is the study participant's physical dependence on nicotine. After completing the baseline assessment, participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_354848], which will be distributed by [CONTACT_6968].

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/15/2022   
 1- Month  Follow -up assessment . Study  participants  will complet e follow- up assessment via 
telehealth session 1 month after their quit  date.  
Quantitative Measures. This assessment will include the following items: contact 
[CONTACT_3031], sexual orientation, gender identity, living with one or more smokers in the 
household, cigarettes smoked/day, quitting attempts, nicotine patch use and FTND. We will also include the System Usability Scale (SUS) score which measures the usability of the SmokefreeSGM program (Appendix G). The SUS is a 10 -item questionnaire with 
5 response options ranging from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5):  
1. I think that I would like to use this text -based smoking cessation program 
(SmokefreeSGM)  frequently.  
2. I found SmokefreeSGM unnecessarily  complex.  
3. I thought SmokefreeSGM was easy to use. 
4. I think  that I would  need  the support  of a technical  person to be able to use 
SmokefreeSGM.  
5. I found the various  functions  in SmokefreeSGM  were  well integrated.  
6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in SmokefreeSGM.  
7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use SmokefreeSGM very 
quickly. 
8. I found SmokefreeSGM very cumbersome to  use. 
9. I felt very confident using  SmokefreeSGM.  
10. I needed  to learn  a lot of things  before I could get going with 
SmokefreeSGM.  
 
For completing the qualitative measurements during the 1- month assessment, 
participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_354849], which will be distributed by [CONTACT_6968].  
 
Qualitative Approach. During the 1 -month assessment, while participants are scoring 
the SUS items, an interviewer will be using probes (e.g., Why do you think so?, What 
makes you feel that way?, etc.) to elicit further information.  
 
The entire 1- month follow- up assessment  will last [ADDRESS_354850] the sessions. Findings from this mixed- method approach will indicate 
if the messages were perceived as interesting and appropriate. Their thoughts and feedback will be 
also critical for driving technical improvements of SmokefreeSGM’s concept, design,  and

 functionality before launching it during the feasibility trial (Part 3, not presented in this protocol 
amendment) targeting SGM smokers who have not participated in the above- mentioned beta- test. 
Following completion of the 1- month assessment, participants will be mailed either a 6 -week supply 
of nicotine patches (NicodermCQ or CVS Health) or a 4- week supply to their physical address, 
depending on if they are a heavy smoker (smoke > 10 cigarettes/day) or light  smoker (smoke ≤ 10 
cigarettes/day).  
Data Safety and Monitoring. This is a minimal risk study. The risks of using the text -based 
platform, completing the 1- month assessment, and/or participating in the in- depth interviews are 
considered minimal and include 1) emotional discomfort due to discussions about sensitive issues, 
and 2) breach of confidentiality. Distress will be minimized by [CONTACT_290865].  
Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_290866]- protecting 
computer files. Data will be stored on a secure server with a firewall to protect the data and to prevent unauthorized access. Databases on the server are password protected and will be 
accessed only by [CONTACT_290867]’s requirements 
for training in Human Subjects’ Protection. All participants will be assigned a unique identification code that will be stored separately  from identifying  information.  All electronic  datasets  will be saved 
in the institutional shared drive and only research team members will be able to access them. The text messaging program will be implemented by [CONTACT_55899], Mosio. Mosio is hosted by [CONTACT_290868], an established, trusted vendor with documented security and regulatory compliance through Equinix.  For data protection  redundancy,  backups  are hosted  using  AWS  HIPAA eligible  services in 
a geo-diverse location.  All Production and backup  data centers  are located  within  the [LOCATION_003].  
 
Statistics. Quantitative data collected via text messaging will be downloaded as an Excel, SPSS, R, 
SAS, or STATA dataset. These software packages will be used for analysis purposes. Study variables will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics. The distributional characteristics of relevant variables will be examined using box plots and histograms to ensure normality assumptions. Routine descriptive statistics, including proportions, means, and standard deviations as well as graphical methods will be reported to explore distributions for all variables. Engagement 
will be assessed among study participants’ data by [CONTACT_290869]. The number of text messages sent and received by [CONTACT_290870].

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/15/[ADDRESS_354851] ranked each  of the SUS 10 questions  from 1 to 5, based on 
their level of agreement (1 for Strongly Disagree to 5 for Strongly  Agree).  
 
● For each of the odd numbered questions,  we will subtract  1 from the score.  
● For each  of the even numbered  questions,  we will subtract  their value  from 5. 
● We will take these  new values  and add up the total score.  Then,  we will multiply  this 
by 2.5. After computing the SUS score, we will convert it to percentile ranks. A 
percentile rank of 75% will indicate that SmokefreeSGM has a high perceived usability.  
 
Qualitati ve data from each individual interview will be analyzed for assessing usability and 
acceptability. Audio recordings from the individual interviews will be transcribed. Data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_199494] a descriptive framework approach which allows for the exploration of a priori  concepts  and for new themes  to emerge.  Transcripts  will be read and reread  
to gain familiarity  with the subject.  Analysis  of the transcripts  will be based  on data groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  creation 
of a code guide, and identification of themes from the narrative text. The coding guide will be drawn on the domains shaped by [CONTACT_290871]. Data analysis will be performed using computer software (ATLAS.ti or NVivo). Result s will inform the 
refinement of a smoking cessation text -based intervention focused on enhancing treatment 
engagement and targeting the specific needs of SGM  smokers.  
 
Ethics. This study involves no more than minimal risk to subjects. The risk of breach of  
confidentiality will be handled by [CONTACT_290872], and that the 
findings of the study may be published, but that participants will not be identified. No direct 
benefits to participating in this research are anticipated. Nevertheless, this research may benefit others since this work may contribute to a greater understanding of mechanisms underlying the acceptability of m obile health (mHealth) smoking cessation interventions among SGM groups.  
Results  will contribute to the design of interventions  targeting  this underserved population of 
smokers.

 be kept confidential, and no names will be used in presenting data in presentations and  
publications.  All data collected through  REDCap  instruments  (e.g.,  screening forms,  baseline,  and 1- 
month assessments, etc.) will be available only to the research personnel, who are knowledgeable 
of all human subjects’ protection  guidelines.  Electronic  datasets  will be password protected and only 
accessed by [CONTACT_290873].  
 
Quality control and assurance. Research team members involved in the study will be trained in 
human subjects’ research. Team members will be available during data collection procedures 
respond via phone call or through telehealth to any question that study  participants could have. 
Each research record (e.g., screening form) from each enrolled participant will be checked to verify that the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been respected.  
 
Publication plan. No text -based smoking cessation intervention has been specifically tailored to SGM 
populations, incorporating text messages with SGM -specific information focusing on affirmative -based 
approaches and copi[INVESTIGATOR_290857] (e.g., internalized 
homophobia, discrimination events, stigma consciousness), among others. Evaluating the design of SmokefreeSGM will provide an opportunity to enhance the usability of this SGM -tailored text -based 
cessation program before launching it in Aim 3. At least one manuscript with findings from Part 2 is expected to be published in a peer -reviewed journal.

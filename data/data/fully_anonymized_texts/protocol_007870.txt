Revised Consent dated April 23, [ADDRESS_1217244] called Percutaneous Nerve Evaluation (PNE) for the treatment of your 
urinary symptoms.  This test will involve placing 2 temporary thin wires through the skin above your 
tailbone to stimulate the nerves in your pelvis that control the bladder. This procedure will be done at 
the HCOC Outpatient Surgery Center. A local anesthetic (numbing medicine) will be injected in the 
area where the wires will enter your skin. Depending on which group you are randomized (assigned) 
to, you may or may not have a type of x-ray called fluoroscopy done at the time of your PNE to show 
that the lead wires are in the correct location. 
The study is being conducted under the direction of [CONTACT_45257] MD and [CONTACT_45259] at the 
University of Louisville.  About [ADDRESS_1217245] wires with the help of fluoroscopy (x-ray), makes 
it more likely for someone to follow through with getting the permanent nerve stimulator implanted 
when compared to patients who have the test wire placed without the help of fluoroscopy.

 Revised Study Consent dated April 23, [ADDRESS_1217246] 50% or greater improvement in your urinary symptoms in this time period, then you 
will be eligible to have the permanent sacral nerve stimulator lead and battery (InterStim), implanted 
in a separate procedure. 
Potential Risks
Risks to PNE include bleeding, bruising, infection, and/or pain or discomfort at the site of the wire 
insertion, movement of the wires and you may feel a temporary tingling sensation. 
 
Risk of fluoroscopy: The amount of time exposed to radiation during fluoroscopy would be similar to 
that of standard x-rays.  
In addition, you may suffer harms that we have not seen before. 
Possible Pregnancy Risks 
Pregnant women are excluded from participation in this study as they are not candidates for sacral 
neuromodulation.
Benefits

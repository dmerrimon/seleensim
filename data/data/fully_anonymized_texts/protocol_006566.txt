II. Physical, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation  
 
Simvastatin is a synthetic derivative of a fermentation product of Aspergillus terreus  and 
is a methylated form of lovastatin.  Like lovastatin, simvastatin is a prodrug which requires hydrolysis for activation as an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor.

 Simvastatin is FDA approved in therapeutic doses of 5 -80 mg/day per os as a 
hypolipi[INVESTIGATOR_299854].  Simvastatin is a methylated derivative of lovastatin, both of 
which are prodrugs that must be activated in the liver.  After oral ingestion, 
simvastatin, which is an inactive lactone, is hydrolyzed to the corresponding beta -
hydroxyacid form.
1 This is an in hibitor of 3 -hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl- coenzyme A 
(HMG -CoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG -CoA to 
mevalonate, which is an early and rate -limiting step in the biosynthesis of 
cholesterol.[ADDRESS_1111361]. Bioavailibility is <5%. Simvastatin and its active 
metabolite are  95% bound to plasma proteins. Approximately 60% of an orally 
absorbed dose is excreted in the feces and 13% in the urine.  The half- life is 1.9 
hours.
2,3 
 
Simvastatin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 hepatic metabolism. Other drugs 
that inhibit CYP3A4 can result in increased HMG -CoA reductase inhibition and 
toxicity.  This is a dose -related phenomenon which usually occurs with repeated 
dosing of both interacting drugs and in the higher dosage range (maximum of 80 mg/day) of simvastatin. Simvastatin does not affect the metabolism of other CYP3A4 substrates.
2,3 Simvastatin is also a substrate and inhibitor of the P -gp 
transport system.2,3

Simvastatin 1.2% Topi[INVESTIGATOR_805003]3A4 can cause at least a 5 -fold increase in plasma AUC 
values or more than an 80% decrease in clearance. These include protease inhibitors (ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), some macrolide antibiotic s 
(clarithromycin, telithromycin), some azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole),  an antidepressant (nefazodone).
[ADDRESS_1111362] a 2 fold increase in the plasma AUC values or a 20 -50% decrease in clearance. Moderat e inhibitors include some 
calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), a macrolide antibiotic (erythromycin), an azole antifungal (fluconazole), an antiemetic (aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]), 
valerian and bergamottin (found in grapefruit juice).

approved in December 2006. Simvastatin is listed as a core medication on the current World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines  for the global 
patient populatio n.

Allergic reactions to HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors are rare, estimated to be 0.1%  
and the incidence of cross -reactivity is unknown .2,3.[ADDRESS_1111365] likely dos e-related reactions and not anticipated in this study.
2.3 
 It is anticipated that the topi[INVESTIGATOR_55594] 1.2 mg of simvastatin (0.15% of the maximum recommended daily dose) will not produce an allergic reaction. In case of an immediate allergic reaction, the subjects will be escorted to the University of 
Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_805004], which is in close proximity to the 
College of Dentistry. In addition, all UI Dental Clinics are equipped with standard emergency supplies/devices should they become necessary, and ACLS trained 
practitioners will be on site.  
 Simvastatin is considered a pregnancy category X drug and should not be used in women of childbearing age unless conception is highly unlikely.  It is unknown if 
simvastatin is excret ed in breast milk and the drug’s use in women who are breast-
feeding is contraindicated by [CONTACT_3455].

maximum recommended daily dose) to healthy adult subjects,  so we do not 
anticipate any toxicity issues. Limited information is available on the acute toxicity 
of statins.8 If any reaction does occur, supportive and symptomatic treatment will 
be initiated and the patient will be closely observed and sent to the UI HC 
emergency room for evaluation and management.  
 Simvastatin has toxic potential similar to other statins. Increases in serum aminotransferase concentrations (AST [SGOT], ALT [SGPT] more than [ADDRESS_1111366] been reported with statins.  These increases are dose related 
and often transient, resolving in the majority of patients without a change in drug 
or dose.

Myopathy occurs in less than 0.7% of patients receiving statins and the risk is dose 
related and also higher in patients with renal or hepatic disease, uncontrolled hypothyroidism and geriatric patients.

 A study by [CONTACT_805009]. used subgingival 1.2% simvastatin gel along with scaling 
and root planning on 60 patients with periodontitis (inflammation of both bone 
and gums  around natural teeth). The study showed that on 1, 2, 4 and 6 month 
recalls, a statistically significant reduction in bleeding on probing, probing depths, clinical attachment loss, as well as increased bone regeneration .

V. Summary of Data  
Recent research has shown that simvastatin ( SMV ); a specific competitive inhibitor of 
3- hydroxyl- 2- methyl-glutaryl coenzym e A (HMG -CoA) reductase  FDA approved 
for lower ing cholesterol, also reduces periodontal inflammation (1,2,3, 4) . Simvastatin 
is has rare allergic reactions ( 5,6), and other complications are mainly dose dependent 
(6) .  The use of Simvastatin results in  reduction of the clinical parameters of gingival 
inflammation, like modified Bleeding index (mSBI) probing depth (PD) and mean clinical attachment loss (CAL) in patients with periodontitis (7).  Moreover, 
Simvastatin reduces the crevicular  levels of interleukin IL -6 and IL -8 (8) both of 
which have been associated with  implants with peri implant disease (9, 10 ).  
The anti- inflammatory effect of simvastatin on implants with peri- implant mucositis 
has not yet been tested, thus the purpose of the present study is to assess the anti - 
inflammatory action of locally delivered simvastatin in subjects with implants affected by [CONTACT_240058]-implant mucositis (defined as BOP and/or purulence but not signs of mesial/distal bone loss greater than 1mm from the accepted reference point on the implant system). the gel used will be used at 0.15% of the maximal recommended dose 
thus any adverse effects are not expected.

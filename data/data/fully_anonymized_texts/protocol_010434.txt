Proposal for Intraoperative Administration of 
Intravenous Indocyanine Green to Evaluate Position of 
the Optic Canal, Position of the Internal Carotid Arteries, 
Tumor Vascularization, and Vessel Encasement in 
Endoscopic Endonasal Cranial Base Surgery . 
 
 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_373632], MD  
Department of Neurological Surgery  
 
 
 
Objective  
 
We intend to demonstrate the feasibility of using a nasal endoscope  to perform 
intraoperative angiography of surgical field , with the goals to evaluate anatomical 
landmarks and tumo r characteristics during skull base surgery and publish a technical 
note.  
 
 
Background  and Rationale  
 
The expanded endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) to the cranial base is increasingly 
being utilized to address a variety of cranial base pathologies.1-7  The more severe 
complications and morbidities associated with EEA are related to vascular and crania l 
nerve injury. 8, 9   
 
The sphenoid sinus is the center and starting point for all the expanded EEA to the ventral 
skull base. Skull base surgeons rely on anatomical landmarks and neuro -navigation to 
perform a safe procedure. However, sphenoid sinus pneumatization may vary and 
anatomical landmarks may not be readily identifiable. In addition, surgeons may not rely 
exclusively on neuro -navigation since it is not always accurate an d precise.  
 
Originally FDA approved for human use in 1959, indocyanine green (ICG) is a 
tricarbocyanine dye with near -infrared fluorescence that has been routinely used in a 
variety of cerebrovascular procedures since 1972 for real -time noninvasive intrao perative 
angiography with a multiple -decades -long safety history.10-14  It is administered as an 
intravenous bolus, typi[INVESTIGATOR_94954] a dose of 25 milligrams dissolved in 10 milliliters of sterile 
water . It binds to large plasma proteins within 2 seconds  and remains intravascular . ICG  is 
meta bolized exclusively by [CONTACT_64683] a plasma half -life of 150 seconds and is excreted

Storz nasal endoscope, which is already purchased and routinely used at The Ohio State 
University (OSU), modified as described by [CONTACT_373639].[ADDRESS_467936] white light as well as n ear-infrared (690 -780 nm wavelength) light and a 
selectable near -infrared filter for the nasal endoscope, both of which will be provided by

 Karl Storz free of charge.  We intend to administer ICG, which is already widely used  during 
open neurosurgical proc edures , to identify  anatomical landmarks (such as vascular 
structures leading to  the optic canal and internal carotid arteries) and tumor 
characteristics (such as tumor vascularization , tissue differentiation , and vessel 
encasement) during skull base surge ry at different  stages of endonasal cranial base surgery  
and tumor dissection: before intradural dissection and during tumor dissection .   
 
 
Eligibility  
 
All adult patients selected to undergo an EEA for cranial base pathology that will require 
any of the following will be eligible for the study : optic canal decompression, intradural 
tumor dissection, dissection of tumor around the internal carotid artery .   
 
Exclusion criteria will include  patient age less than 18 years;  history of sulfa , iodide , or 
penici llin allergy; previous anaphylactic r eaction to ICG;  women currently pregnant or 
nursing . Patients of child bearing potential are routinely screened for pregnancy before the 
surgery using urinary or blood beta -HCG  test.   
 
 
Management of Adverse Experiences  
 
1. Adverse Events  
 
1.1. Adverse Event Definition  
 
An adverse event (AE) will be considered any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition 
considered related to the intervention. Medical condition/diseases present before starting the 
intervention will be considered AEs only if they worsen after starting the study and that 
worsening is considered related to the study intervention. An AE is also any undesirable and 
unintended effect of research occurring in human subjects as a result of the collection of 
identifiable private information under the research. AEs will be recorded up to the day of the 
final follow -up visit, and if still present, they will be recorded as “ongoing” at the end of the 
study. The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_105] -directive que stioning of the patient at 
each visit during the study. AEs also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_373641].  
 
Risk and Benefit Assessment  
 
Per the 2006 FDA label for ICG, the only listed risks of ICG administration are urticarial or 
anaphylactic reactions, which are rare.  ICG contains sodium iodide, so caution is recommended 
in patients with a history of iodide allergy.  Per this FDA label, “There are no data available 
describing the signs, symptoms, or laboratory fin dings accompanying overdosage. The LD 50 
after I.V. administration ranges between 60 and 80 mg/kg in mice, 50 and 70 mg/kg in rats and 
50 and 80 mg/kg in rabbits. ”  The FDA arbitrarily suggests a maximum do se of 2mg/kg for 
human use, and this would be our dosage maximum.  The main risk to our study population

IRB Approval Date:  11/27/[ADDRESS_467937] (IRB) Review and Informed Consent  
 
This protocol and the informed consent document and any subsequent modificatio ns will 
be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_38993].  A signed consent form will be obtained from the subject.  The consent form will 
describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and t he risks and benefits 
of participation, and the rights of the participant.  A copy of the consent form will be given 
to the subject and this fact will be documented in the subject’s record.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_373633].  The 
study will also be submitted for continuing review by [CONTACT_373642], at lease annually, for the duration of the  study.  
 
2. Subject Confidentiality  
 
Subject data records will be identified by a study specific identification number.   
All subject records will be kept in a locked file cabinet.  All computer entry and networking 
programs will be done using study specific identification number only.  Clinical information 
will not be released without written permission of the subject , excep t as necessary for 
monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, the OHRP, the sponsor, or the sponsor’s designee.  
 
3. Subjects’ Rights  
 
Subjects will have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty or lose 
of any of their usual benefits.  
 
Data Collection  
 
Specifically, patient demographic/clinical information to be included in this feasibility 
study  will include:  
IRB Protocol Number: 2016H0193  
Version: 4.0 
IRB Approval Date:  11/27/[ADDRESS_467938] and MR 
studies in addition to intraoperative angiography and intraoperative endoscopic images of 
the surgical site.  
 
If, during the course of th e procedure, the operator determines that it would be in patient's 
best interest to prematurely abort the procedure due to unforeseen events, it will be under the 
discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_373634]. If patient has a  
second procedure after the first procedure was prematurely aborted, it is up to the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_373635] -dose patient with the ICG dye and complete the study procedures and collect 
study data from the second procedure.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_373636].   ICG dye half -life is 3 -4 minutes and does not pose a threat 
of overdosing.  
 
In summary, this novel technique for performing real -time endoscopic intranasal 
angiography could substantially improve the safety of surgery by [CONTACT_373643]; by [CONTACT_373644].  
This information may prompt further surgical action to avoid the complications associated 
with optic canal decompression, dissection near the internal carotid and tumor dissection .  
Presentati on of this feasibility study  in the literature will likely lead to wide acceptance and 
implementation of this technique due to the highly useful information it will yield as well as 
its high degree of feasibility, as institutions performing EEA procedures already possess the 
materials necessary to perform it.

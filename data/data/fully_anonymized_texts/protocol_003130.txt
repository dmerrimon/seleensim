 This is an open -label, longer -term follow -on study of AR101 in subjects who participated 
in a previous AR101 clinical study.  Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the 
study data, and no formal hypothesis testing or sample size calculations are required.  
Therefore, the endpoints are not ordered in a statistical hierarchy.   
Study Design  Treatment Pathways  
ARC008 is a phase 3, international, open -label, longer -term study of an AR101 CODIT 
regimen in children and adults with peanut allergy.  Subjects entering ARC008 will 
originate from an Aimmune AR101 clinical study or any future clinical study that 
identifies ARC008 as a potential poststudy option in the parent study protocol.   
Because the dosing regimens and procedures in the parent studies are not uniform, 
subjects will receive AR101 i n 1 of 5 treatment pathways in ARC008:  
• Treatment Pathway  1 is for subjects who received and tolerated AR101 in a daily 
or nondaily regimen in the parent study (except study ARC005).  These subjects 
will have a Screening/Baseline visit, and eligible subjec ts will enter the Extended 
Maintenance Period.  Subjects entering ARC008 on a dose >  300 mg once daily 
(QD) will switch to [ADDRESS_732923] day of the Extended Maintenance 
Period.  Subjects from parent study ARC004 on nondaily regimens who did not 
tolerate 600  mg peanut protein (1043  mg peanut protein cumulative dose) at the 
ARC004 Exit DBPCFC will switch to [ADDRESS_732924] day of the Extended 
Maintenance Period.  Subjects receiving nondaily AR101 regimens in parent study 
ARC004 who tolerated 6 00 mg peanut protein (1043  mg peanut protein cumulative 
dose) at the ARC004 Exit DBPCFC will continue the nondaily AR101 regimen in 
the Extended Maintenance Period.   
ARC008 CSR Final

Aimmune Therapeutics  AR101  ARC008 Protocol Amend 6.0  
22 Dec 2020  - FINAL  Aimmune Confidential Information  
• Treatment Pathway  2 is for the following subjects:  
– Subjects who did not complete their AR101 dosing regimen (eg,  up-dosing, 
maintenance) in an eligible parent study (except study ARC005).   
– Subjects from parent study ARC004 or any future clinical study identifying 
ARC008 as its follow -on study, who received a nondaily AR101 dosing regi men 
and who did not tolerate this regimen.   
– Subjects from ARC004 who missed or withheld their nondaily AR101 dose for 
> 3 days, and subjects who received a nondaily AR101 dosing regimen and 
tolerated less than the 300  mg single dose of peanut protein (443  mg 
cumulative) at the ARC004 Exit DBPCFC, if continued treatment with AR101 
was determined to be safe per investigator judgment and after discussion with 
the medical monitor.   
Subjects who did not complete their AR101 dosing regimen in an eligible parent  
study will have a  Screening/Baseline visit and continue the regimen in ARC008, 
proceeding through the applicable study periods until the End of Treatment visit.  
Subjects who enter ARC008 soon after completing the ARC004 Early 
Discontinuation visit will h ave a  Screening/Baseline visit, and eligible subjects will 
start the Repeat Up -Dosing Period at a dose of 80, 120, or 160  mg QD (a decrease 
in AR101 dose of approximately 50%  to 75%) at the discretion of the investigator.  
These subjects will then proceed sequentially through the Initial Maintenance 
Period and Extended Maintenance Period.  Subjects who complete the Repeat 
Up-Dosing Period or who tolerate AR101 [ADDRESS_732925] a Screening/Baseline visit in ARC008 and then proceed to  the Initial 
Maintenance Period.  Subjects who complete both the Repeat Up -Dosing and Initial 
Maintenance Periods or receive AR101 [ADDRESS_732926] a Screening/Baseline visit in ARC008 and then proceed to the 
Extended Mai ntenance Period.  In addition, ARC004 subjects who tolerated the 
nondaily regimen in ARC004 but who subsequently do not tolerate the nondaily 
regimen after entering ARC008 Treatment Pathway  [ADDRESS_732927] 2 and start the Repeat Up -Dosing  Period at investigator discretion.   
• Treatment Pathway  3 is for subjects who received placebo in the parent study 
(except study ARC005).  These subjects will undergo a Screening/Baseline visit, 
and eligible subjects will start the Initial Escalation Perio d with a dose of 0.5  mg.  
Subjects will then proceed sequentially through the Up -Dosing Period, Initial 
Maintenance Period, and Extended Maintenance Period.   
• Treatment Pathway  4 is for subjects who received AR101 and tolerated the 
300 mg/day dose for at l east [ADDRESS_732928] a Screening/Baseline visit, and eligible 
subjects will start the Extended Maintenance Period.   
• Treatment Pathway  [ADDRESS_732929] a Screening/Baseline visit, and eligible subjects

Initial Escalation Period (Treatment Pathways  3 and  5) 
All Initial Escalation Period doses will be administered by [CONTACT_558274].   
Treatment Pathway  3 
Eligible subjects will initiate AR101 at a dose of 0.5  mg of AR101 and then increase the 
dose incrementally at 20 - to 30 -minute intervals over the course of a single day to a 
maximum dose of 6  mg.   
Subjects who do not tolerate ≥  3 mg dose on Day  1 will discontinue dosing and complete 
the End of Treatment visit.   
Subjects who tolerate ≥  [ADDRESS_732930]  5 
Eligible subjects will begin initial dose escalation on Day  1 with a stepwise dose 
escalation of AR101 (up to 4  single doses of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 3  mg) administered at 20 - to 
30-minute intervals as tolerated.  Subjects w ho tolerate the 3  mg dose on Day  1 will 
return on Day  2 for a single 1  mg dose.  Subjects who tolerate the 1  mg dose with no 
more than mild allergy symptoms that are not dose -limiting will begin the Up -Dosing 
Period.  Subjects who do not tolerate any dose on Day  1 or Day  2 will discontinue dosing 
and complete the End of Treatment visit.   
Up-Dosing Period (Treatment Pathways  2, 3, and  5) 
The Up -Dosing Period is designed to allow stepwise increases in AR101 dose over 
2-week intervals to build up tolerance to  the allergen while minimizing AEs.  The first 
dose at each new dose level will be administered in the clinic.  Subsequent doses will be 
dispensed to the subject or parent/caregiver and administered at home.   
To escalate to the next dose, a subject must b e tolerating the current dose.  Some subjects 
may require de -escalation, and once the lower dose is tolerated they may again attempt 
increasing the dose.   
Treatment Pathway  [ADDRESS_732931] a  Screening/Baseline visit and continue up -dosing in ARC008, proceeding 
through the applicable study periods until the End of Treatment visit.   
Subjects who enter ARC008 soon after completing the ARC004 Early Discontinuation 
visit will h ave a  Screening/Baseline visit  in ARC008 and then enter a Repeat Up -Dosing 
Period, starting with a  daily dose of AR101 at 80, 120, or 160  mg/day at the discretion of 
the investigator.  The dose will be increased every 2  weeks until the maximum daily dose 
of 300  mg is reached.  Subjects who tolerate the 300  mg/day dose for [ADDRESS_732932] 3 will receive AR101 starting at a dose of 3  mg QD and 
escalate every 2  weeks to a maximum of 300  mg QD, according to the Up -Dosing 
Schedule.  Those subjects who reach the target dose of 300  mg QD of AR101 will take 
this dose for 2  additional weeks as part of the Up -Dosing Period.  Subjects who do not 
tolerate the 300  mg QD dose of AR101 for 2  weeks within 52  weeks (ie, must reach 
300 mg dose by 50  weeks) after starting the Up -Dosing Period will discontinue dosing 
and complete the End of Treatment visit.  Once a  subject tolerates the [ADDRESS_732933]  5 
Subjects will receive AR101 starting at the 1  mg/day dose and dose escalation will occur 
every 2  weeks u ntil the maximum daily dose of 300  mg is reached.  Subjects who tolerate 
the 300  mg/day dose for 2  weeks within 40  weeks after start of up -dosing will begin the 
Initial Maintenance Period.  Subjects who do not tolerate the 300  mg/day dose for 
2 weeks withi n 40 weeks after start of up -dosing will discontinue dosing and complete the 
End of Treatment visit.   
Initial Maintenance Period (Pathways 2, 3, and  5) 
Subjects in Treatment Pathways  2, 3, and  [ADDRESS_732934]  2 who completed the Up -Dosing/Repeat Up -Dosing 
Period or who tolerated AR101 300  mg QD for 2  weeks in ARC004 will enter the Initial 
Maintenance Period after the  ARC008 Screening/Baseline visit.  Subjects who did not 
complete their AR101 maintenance regimen in an eligible parent study (except study 
ARC005) will have a  Screening/Baseline visit and begin the Initial Maintenance Period in 
ARC008.   
Subjects in Treatm ent Pathways  [ADDRESS_732935]  5 will continue init ial maintenance (with clinic visits 
every 4  weeks) for an overall total of approximately 12  months of treatment (including 
initial dose escalation, up -dosing, and maintenance treatment).  The duration of initial 
maintenance treatment may vary from a  minimu m of 12  weeks to a maximum of 
24 weeks depending on the duration of up -dosing (24 -40 weeks).  Subjects in Treatment 
Pathway  [ADDRESS_732936] an OLFC at the end of initial maintenance (ie,  after an overall total 
of approximately 12  months of treatment).   
Extend ed Maintenance Period (All Treatment Pathways)  
The last treatment period for all treatment pathways is the Extended Maintenance Period.  
Subjects who completed initial maintenance in the parent AR101 study (Treatment 
Pathways  1 and  4) will enter the Extend ed Maintenance Period after the 
Screening/Baseline visit, and the other subjects (Treatment Pathways 2, 3, and  5) will 
enter this period after completing the Initial Maintenance Period in this study, after 
completing both the Repeat Up -Dosing and Initial M aintenance Periods in their parent 
study, or after receiving AR101 [ADDRESS_732937] 24  weeks in their parent study.   
During the Extended Maintenance Period, subjects will continue their current dosing 
regimen (300  mg QD, every other day [QOD], twice  weekly [BIW], once weekly [QW], 
or every other week [QOW]), and study visits will occur approximately every [ADDRESS_732938] 12  months of extended maintenance treatment

1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background  
Updated background information is provided in the AR101 investigator brochure.   
Peanut allergy is a potentially serious condition that disproportionately affects children and is 
associated with severe allergic reactions, including life -threaten ing anaphylaxis .  The 
prevalence of peanut allergy, like other food allergies, has been rising in the Western world 
and is estimated to be approximately 2% in children in both the U nited States (US)  and 
Europe ( Gupta,  2018 ; Turner,  2017 ; Nwaru,  2014 ).   
Aimmune Therapeutics , Inc. , a Nestlé Health Science Company  (Aimmune) developed 
AR101, also known as Palforzia, Peanut ( Arachis  hypogaea ) Allergen Powder -dnfp in the 
US, and defatted powder of Arachis  hypogaea  L., semen (peanuts ) in the European Union 
(EU) , using a characterized oral immunotherapy (OIT) desensitization approach for patients 
with peanut allergy.  On 31  Jan 2020, the U S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved AR101 (Palforzia) as a  treatment for patients aged [ADDRESS_732965] the health -related 
quality of life (QoL) for subjects and their families (Primeau,  2000 ; Avery,  2003 ; 
Buchanan,  2007 ; Sicherer,  2010 ; Hofmann , 2009 ; Anagnostou,  2014 ).  In addition, 
peanut -avoidant diets are complicated by [CONTACT_558280] (Joshi,  2002 ; 
Altschul,  2001 ; Vierk,  2002 ).  Accidental e xposures a re common, with up to 50%  of 
food-allergic subjects having  ≥ 1 allergic reaction over a 2 -year period ( Sicherer , 1998 ).   
OIT for peanut allergy has demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy results in creating a 
change in clinic al reactivity to desensitize  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_266742] 
(Jones,  2009 ; Hofmann,  2009 ; Blumchen,  2010 ; Yu, 2012 ; Varshney, 2011 ; 
Anagnostou,  2014 ).  Investigational OIT studies involved a period of up -dosing with 
increasing amounts of peanut protein, a period of maintenance therapy, and then a food 
challenge to assess desensitization .  Dosing symptoms in these studies included rash, 
wheezing, rhinorrhea, sneezing, itching, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea .  
Most symptoms were  mild, consistent with a transient, low -grade allergic reaction, and 
tended to diminish in frequency with increasing duration of treatment .

subjects and may also induce favorable immunologic changes over time .  The goal of OIT 
with AR101 is to induce and maintain a state of desensitization to peanut protein, de fined as 
the ability to consume a specific dose of peanut protein with no more than mild allergy 
symptoms .  In conjunction with a peanut -avoidant diet, this state should be sufficient to 
desensitize a peanut -allergic individual from the adverse effects of an accidental exposure to 
peanuts or peanut -containing foods .   
1.2 Clinical Studies  of AR101  
Updated results for  AR101 clinical studies are  provided in the AR101 investigator brochure .  
Brief descriptions of the study designs are provided in this section.   
1.2.1 ARC001 and ARC002  
ARC001 was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study of 
the efficacy and safety of OIT  with AR101 in children and adults 4  to 26  years of age with 
peanut allergy conducted in the US .  The study is complete.  ARC001 consisted of a 
Screening Period with a S creening double -blind , placebo -controlled food challenge 
(DBPCFC), an I nitial Escalatio n Period, an Up -Dosing Period to a target dose of 300  mg 
once daily (QD) , a Maint enance Period ( 300 mg QD for 2  weeks ), and an Exit DBPCFC .  
Subjects were randomized to either AR101 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio .  The primary endpoint 
of ARC001 was the percentage of desensitization responders, defined as subjects tolerating 
300 mg peanut protein  (443 mg peanut protein cumulative) with no more than mild 
symptoms at the Exit DBPCFC .  The intent -to-treat population comprised 55  subjects:  [ADDRESS_732967] ed of 2 parts .  Part 1 allowed former 
placebo -treated subjects  to receive AR101 by  [CONTACT_558281]-dosing to 300  mg QD, 
and former AR101 -treated subjects  to continue treatment with 300  mg QD.  All subjects  
maintain ed the 300  mg daily dose for 12  weeks and  then had a DBPCFC .  The subjects who 
completed this DBPCFC were then giv en the choice to contin ue 300  mg/day  dosing  or enter 
a high -dose up -dosing period to a target maximum of 2000  mg/day  (Part  2).  Once the 
individual maximum tolerated dose was reached , subjects were  maintai ned on this dose .  A 
total of [ADDRESS_732968] s entered Part 2.   
1.2.2 ARC003 (PALISADE) and ARC004 ( PALISADE F ollow -On Study)  
ARC003 (PALISADE) was a phase 3, international, ra ndomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled study of the efficacy and safety of AR101 ch aracterized oral 
desensitization immunotherapy (CODIT ™) in children and adults  4 to 55  years of age  with 
peanut allergy (PALISADE  Group of Clinical  Investigators,  2018 ).  The study is complete.  
Subjects were randomized to either AR101 or placebo in a 3:[ADDRESS_732969] ed of a

(approximately 24  weeks),  and an Exit DBPCFC .  A tot al of [ADDRESS_732970] of 
extending the dosing interval from daily to eve ry other day  (QOD) , twice  weekly  (BIW) , 
once weekly  (QW) , and every other week  (QOW) .  Subjects who received AR101 during  
ARC003 participate d in [ADDRESS_732971] 28  weeks .  Subjects who received  placebo in 
ARC003 had initial escalation and up -dosing to a target dose level of 300  mg QD, and 
continue d that dose daily  for the 24 -week Initial Maintenance Period before having  
a DBPCFC .  Subjects who tolerate d ≥ 443 mg peanut protein cumulative at this DBPCFC 
continue d treatment in the Extended Maintenance Period .  At the end of the Extended 
Maintenance Period, all subjects had an Exit DBPCFC .  After the end of participation in 
ARC004, eli gible subjects could  enroll in ARC008.   
1.2.3 ARC007 (RAMSES)  and ARC011 (RAMSES Follow -On Study)  
ARC007 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study of 
the safety of AR101 CODIT in children ages 4  to 17 years  of age  with peanu t allergy 
conducted in the US and Canada .  The study is complete.  A total of 506  subjects were  
random ly assigned 2:1 to AR101 or placebo .  No food challenges were  conducted during  the 
study .  Subjects who received  AR101 , complete d the Initial Escalation and Up -Dosing 
Periods , and tolerat ed the target dose of 300  mg QD for 2  weeks were  eligible to enroll in  
study ARC011 described below .  Subjects who received  placebo were  eligible to enroll in  
ARC008 directly and un dergo initial esc alation and up -dosing to a target dose level of 
300 mg QD.  Subjects who did not complete their AR101 up -dosing regimen  in ARC007 and 
did not discontinue early due to adverse events (AEs) could  enroll in ARC008 .   
ARC011 was a phase 3, open -label, extension study for subjects previously enrolled and 
treated with AR101 in the ARC007 (RAMSES) study and who reached the target dose of 
300 mg QD .  The s tudy is complete.  Upon entry into ARC011, subjects continue d this dose 
regimen for approximatel y 24 weeks to generate additional safety data .  Subjects who 
complet ed this Initial Maintenance Period could enroll in  ARC008 .   
1.2.4 ARC010 (ARTEMIS)  
ARC010 was a phase 3, multicenter, double -blind , placebo -controlled study of the efficacy 
and safety of AR101 CODIT in subjects aged 4  to 17  years  with peanut allergy conducted in 
Europe .  The study is complete.  A total of 175  subjects were  random ly assigned  3:1 to 
AR101 or placebo .  Subjects who reach ed the target dose of 300  mg QD and maintain ed this 
dose for the approximately 12 -week Maintenance Period had a DBPCFC .  Subjects who 
received AR101 and subjects who received placebo  were  offered the opportunity  to enter  
ARC008 .

1.2.5 ARC005 (POSEIDON)  
ARC005 is a n ongoing  phase  3, international, randomiz ed, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study of the efficacy and safety of AR101 in children aged 1  to < 4 years  with peanut allergy .  
Approximately 132  subjects aged 1  to < 4 years will be randomly assigned  2:[ADDRESS_732972] (up to 4  single doses of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 3  mg on day  1 and a 
single 1  mg dose on day  2), up -dosing (from 1  mg/day up to 300  mg/day with dose escalation 
approximately every 2  weeks), and maintenance treatment (300  mg/day daily until the 
subject completes  approximately 12  months of treatment overall [including initial dose 
escalation, up -dosing, and maintenance]).  An exit DBPCFC wi ll be performed after the end 
of maintenance treatment.  After study exit, eligible subjects will have the option to enroll in  
ARC008 .   
1.3 Rationale for the Current Study  
ARC008  is an open -label , international, longer-term extension  study  for eligible subjec ts 
who participated in prior or future  Aimmune AR101 clinical  studies .  The rationale for 
conducting ARC008 is as follows :  
• To allow subjects who received placebo in Aimmune -sponsored clinic al studies with 
AR101 to receive AR101 drug product   
• To allow subjects who received AR101 in Aimmune -sponsored clinical studies to 
continue treatment  
• To assess  safety  and tolerability  during longer -term administration of AR101  and 
follow -up observation after the last dose of AR101  
• To explore whether the leve l of desensitization to peanut protein is maintained or 
continues to increase after longer -term administration of AR101 and follow -up 
observation after the last dose of AR101  
1.4 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Subjects  
The current edition of the AR101 investigator brochure provides further information on the 
risks and benefits of AR101 .   
1.4.1 Risks  
The risks of this study include AEs associated with AR101 treatment, risks from the oral 
food challenges , and risks of decreased  vigilance  in avoidance of peanut -contain ing foods .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events Associated With  AR101  Treatment  
The most frequently reported AEs associated with AR101 treatment are mild to moderate 
symptoms of allergic reactions, especially those associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract.  More specifically, AR101 CODI T has caus ed allergic symptoms of sneezing, 
ARC008 CSR Final

rhinorrhea, urticaria , angioedema, flushing, e czema flare -ups, ocular, nasal, and /or oral throat 
pruritus, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discom fort, abdominal pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cough, 
wheezing , and shortness of breath, in addition to anaphylaxis  as defined by [CONTACT_558282] -Food Allergy and 
Anaphylaxis Network workgroup ( Sampson , 2006 ).   
In this protocol, anaphylaxis refers to anaphylactic events or systemic allergic reaction s of 
any severity.  Anaphylaxis is  a prespecified AE of interest (AEI) and an identified risk of 
AR101 treatment, especially when cofactors are present that c an augment allergic reactivity, 
such as exercise or viral infection.   
As of 31  Jul 2020 , 16 of 1237  AR101 -treated subjects (1.3%) overall in the entire clinical 
development program experienced a severe event of anaphylaxis in 4  studies.  Fifteen events 
were triggered by [CONTACT_107285]101 and 1  by [CONTACT_558283].  Two event s were  
considered serious.  All subjects recovered  and none required prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_558238] .  Eleven subjects 
continued study treatment and 5 discontinued from their study.  Thirteen subjects had 1  or 
more potential cofactors  (exercise was the most common, 8  subjects) .   
In addition to anaphylaxis  (systemic allergic reactions of any severity) , eosinophilic 
esophagitis ( EoE) is also an AEI.  As of [ADDRESS_732973], and follow -up information was not available for 3  subjects in the ongoing 
study ARC008.  It is unclear how many of these cases were present  prior to AR101 treatment 
and how many were exacerbated or c aused by [CONTACT_107285]101.   
Asthma is a risk factor for life -threatening or fatal anaphylaxis in patients with food allergy.  
Patients with severe or uncontrolled asthma are excluded from AR101 clinical studies.  As of 
31 Jul 2020, 2  subjects (0.2%) overall in the A R101 clinical program experienced serious 
events of asthma related to AR101 treatment.  Both subjects had a history of asthma.  
A moderate event of asthma (attack) was reported in [ADDRESS_732974] in 2019 and a moderate event 
of asthma (exacerbation) was reported previously in [ADDRESS_732975] in 2016.  Additional 
information is provided in the investigator brochure.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risks of Oral Food Challen ges 
Oral food challenges may induce an allergic response .  Allergic reactions to oral food 
challenges  can be severe and even life -threatening .  However, in general, the risk of an 
allergic reaction  is reduced by [CONTACT_80927] a  very small a mount of the food, 
gradually increasing the dose, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80872] a moderate 
reaction .  If subjects have allergic reactions during the challenges, they may need oral, 
intramuscular, or intravenous (IV) medications .  In ARC00 8, subjects will be monitored 
appropriately, and any reaction will be treated in accordance with the study center standard 
ARC008 CSR Final

of care .  Trained personnel, including a physician, as wel l as medications and equipment per 
Practical Allergy  (PRACTALL ) recommendat ions and study site standard operating 
procedures will be immediately available to treat any reaction  (Sampson,  2012 ).   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risk s of Decreased Vigilance  
There may be a risk that subjects may decrease their vigilance against accidental peanut 
ingestion during participation in the study because they believe they are protected from it .  
This phenomenon has been reported in previous studies , and  subjects in th e study and their 
parents/caregivers  will be warned that they should continue to practice their  usual vigilance 
against accidental ingestion  of peanuts or peanut -containing foods .   
1.4.[ADDRESS_732976] dose of 
peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms at the exit DBPCFC (AR101 -placebo) was 
63.2%  (p < 0.0001) for at l east 600  mg and 47.8%  (p < 0.0001) for at least [ADDRESS_732977] 
dose of 1000  mg peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms at the exit DBPCFC was 
56.0%  (p < 0.0001).  These data demonstrate meaningful clinical improvement after AR101 
maintenance periods of approximately 6  months in ARC003 and 3  months in ARC010.  
Tolerability of single doses of 600  and 1000  mg peanut protein provides approximately 
4.8-fold and 8 -fold margins over the median estimated real -world eliciting dose of 125  mg 
peanut protein ( Deschildre,  2016 ).  Favorable treatment effects of AR101 compared with 
placebo were also observed for key secondary endpoints of desensitization response at other 
challenge dose levels and maximum severity of symptoms during the DBPCFCs.  The 
reduced severity of symptoms and reduced use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_558239]101 -treated subjects compared with placebo -treated subjects indicate that allerg ic 
reactions following unintended exposure are likely to be less severe in patients receiving 
AR101.  AR101 was approved as Palforzia for marketing in the US by [CONTACT_558284]  2020 and for marketing in the EU by [CONTACT_558285]  2020 .   
1.4.3 AR101 Benefits and Risks Assessment  
In summary, AR101 produces a high rate of successful desensitization to a clinically 
meaningful level of peanut protein, providing treated individuals the potential benefit of 
mitigating allergic reactions, including  anaphylaxis, after unintended exposure to peanut, 
which continues to justify the acceptable risk.

3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Treatment Pathways  
ARC008  is a phase  3, international , open -label, longer-term study  of an AR101  CODIT  
regimen in children and adults  with peanut allergy .  Subjects entering ARC008 will originate 
from  an Aimmune AR101  clinical study  or any future clinical study  that identifies ARC008 
as a potential poststudy option  in the parent study protocol .   
Because the dosing regimens and procedures in the parent studies  are not uniform, subjects 
will receive AR101 in 1  of 5 treatment pathways in ARC008:   
• Treatment Pathway  1 is for subjects who received and tolerated AR101 in a daily or 
nondaily regimen in the parent study ( except study ARC005 ).  These subjects will 
undergo a Screening/Bas eline visit, and eligible subjects will enter the Extended 
Maintenance Period .  Subjects entering ARC008 on a dose > [ADDRESS_732978] day of the Extended Maintenance Period .  Subjects from 
parent study ARC004 on nondaily regi mens who did not tolerate  600 mg peanut 
protein ( 1043  mg peanut protein cumulative d ose) at the ARC004 Exit DBPCFC will 
switch to [ADDRESS_732979] day of the Extended Maintenance Period .  Subjects 
receiving nondaily AR101 regimens in  parent study ARC 004 who tolerate d 600 mg 
peanut protein (1043  mg peanut protein cumulative dose) at the ARC004 Exit 
DBPCFC will continue the nondaily AR101  regimen in the Extended Maintenance 
Period .   
• Treatment Pathway  2 is for  the following subjects:  
– Subjects who did not complete their AR101 dosing regimen (eg,  up-dosing, 
maintenance) in an eligible parent study  (except study ARC005) .   
– Subjects from parent study ARC004 , or any future clinical study  identifying 
ARC008 as a follow -on study , who received a non daily AR101  dosing regimen 
and who did not tolerate this regimen .   
– Subjects from ARC004 who miss ed or withheld  their nondaily AR101 dose for 
> 3 days, and  subjects who received a  nondaily AR101 dosing regimen and 
tolerated less than the 300  mg single dose of peanut protein (443  mg cumulative) 
at the ARC004 Exit DBPCFC , if continued treatment with AR101 was

proceeding through the appl icable study periods until the End of Treatment  visit.  
Subjects who enter ARC008 soon after completing the ARC004 Early 
Discontinuation visit will have  a Screening/Baseline visit, and eligible subjects will 
start t he Repeat Up -Dosing Period at a  dose of 80, 120, or 160  mg QD (a decrease in  
AR101 dose of approximately 50 % to 75%) at the discretion of the investigator .  
These s ubjects will then proceed sequentially through the Initial Maintenance Period 
and Extended Maintenance Peri od.  Subjects who complete the Repeat Up -Dosing 
Period  or who tolerate AR101 [ADDRESS_732981] a 
Screening/Baseline visit in ARC008 and then proceed to the Initial Maintenance 
Period.  Subjects who complete both the Repeat Up -Dosing  and Initial Maintenance 
Perio ds or receive AR101 [ADDRESS_732982]

Period.  In addition, ARC004 subjects who tolerated the nondaily regimen  in 
ARC004 but who subse quently do not tolerate the non daily regimen after en tering 
ARC008 Treatment Pathway  [ADDRESS_732983]  2 and start the 
Repeat Up -Dosing Period  at investigator discretion .   
• Treatment Pathway  3 is for subjects who received placebo in the parent study  (except 
study ARC005) .  These subjects will undergo a Screening/Baseline visit, and eligible 
subjects will start the Initial Escalation Period with a dose of 0.5 mg.  Subjects will 
then proceed sequ entially throu gh the Up -Dosing Period, Initial Maintenance Period, 
and Extended Maintenance Period .   
• Treatment Pathway  4 is for subjects who received AR101 and tolerated the 
300 mg/day dose for at least [ADDRESS_732984] a Screening/Baseline visit, and eligible 
subjects will start the Extended Maintenance Period.   
• Treatment Pathway  [ADDRESS_732985] a Screening/ Baseline visit, and eligible subjects will start the

nondaily doses (eg, QOD dosing regimen, subject misses Monday and Wednesday 
doses) during any part of the study other than for treatment of an AE or a dispensing 
error  
• Medically necessary  dose interruptions:  Subjects who miss more t han 4  consecutive 
scheduled non daily doses due to medically indicated circumstances (eg, as part of the 
treatment for intercurrent AEs)  
• Safety / tolerabili ty concerns:  Any subject on non daily  dosing having 1  related 
serious adverse event ( SAE ), 1 related AE graded severe, 2  related AEs occurring on

3.4.2 Desensitization Measurement Procedures  
In addition to food challenges, t his study  will investigate potential surrogate immunologic 
tests to assess desensitization .  Specifically, the utility of total, peanut -specific , and peanut 
component -specific IgE, and peanut -specific and peanut component -specific IgG4  will be 
explored as surrogate marker s of peanut allergy or response to OIT .   
To measure the level of desensitization  to peanut protein , OLFCs will be conducted as 
follows:  
• Treatment Pathways  1, 2, and  3:  an optional OLFC  will be conducted at annual 
intervals beginning after 12  months in the  Extended Maintenance Period  
• Treatment Pathway  4:  an OLFC will be required after the first 12  months in the  
Extended Maintenance Period  and optional at annual intervals thereafter  
• Treatment Pathway  5:  an OLFC will be required at the End of Initial Mainte nance 
and after the first [ADDRESS_733007] single dose of the food challenges  will be 2000  mg peanut protein .  The 
inclusion  of a 2000  mg dose is consistent with previously published literature  
(Varshney,  2011 ; Blumchen,  2010 ; Jones,  2009 ), and represents 1 dose level above the dose  
tested in DBPCFCs in the AR101 phase  2 study ARC002 .  In study ARC002 , approximately 
65% of subjects tre ated for only about 9  months (of which approximately  3 months was 
maintenance dosing) passed a 1000  mg single dose challenge ( 2043  mg cumulati ve dose) 
without dose -limiting symptoms and would have been offered another dose level if available .  
Therefore , the [ADDRESS_733008] 
procedures for desensitization studies  and are those used in the Aimmune AR101 program to 
date.  Questionnaires are used for assessment of Q oL (Section  6.5), treat ment  satisfaction  
(Section  6.5), asthma control (Section  6.4), allergic rhinitis (Section  6.4), and eczema/atopic 
dermatitis ( Section  6.4).

AR101 is characterized peanut allergen in the form of peanut flour, formulated with a 
bulking agent  (maize starch, microcrystalline cellulose,  and other excipi[INVESTIGATOR_558241] ) and a  flow agent in premeasured graduated doses .  The capsules used in the Initial 
Escalation Period and Up -Dosing Period of this study currently include the following 
strengths:  0.5, 1, 10, 20, and 100  mg each of peanut protein .  AR101 is characterized by [CONTACT_558295] -linked immunosorbent assay for 
key allergenic proteins to demonstrate stability and lot -to-lot consistency .   
AR101 c apsules will be provided in prepackaged dosing kits .  For the escalation periods, 
each individual kit will contain 21  daily doses  at a given dose level, enough to su pply 
2 weeks of dosing plus a 7 -day overage to accommodate potential visit scheduling issues .   
For Initial and Extended Maintenance Period dosing, a 300 mg AR101 dose will be provided 
in sealed, foil -laminate sachets (1  sachet/day) .  Sachets will be provided in kits containing 
[ADDRESS_733024] iden tification number  using a 
web-based interactive response system (IXRS) , directly at the study site or the study site 
pharmacy, according to site -specific institutional policies .  AR101  will then be distributed to 
each subject or  parent/ caregiver  by [CONTACT_26271] .   
AR101  will be stored in a secure location  at each study site  and kept refrigerated between 
2°C and 8°C .  Study site pers onnel  will maintain temperature logs for all refrigerators storing

any other dosing interval or any other subject .   
At each clinic  visit in the Up -Dosing , Initial Maintenance, and Extended Maintenance 
Periods , the subject  or parent/ caregiver  will receive a kit of capsules or sachets to be taken at 
home according to the current dose level .  The subject  or pare nt/caregiver  will be instructed 
to store the dosing kit in the refrigerator at all times other than when it is removed to obtain 
the dai ly dose , and to bring all unused capsules/sachets back to the clinic at the next visit .  
For Treatment Pathways  4 and  5 only, the  parent/ caregiver  will be instructed to record the 
capsules/sachets taken at home in a diary log.   
In exceptional circumstance s when a subject is unable to return to the clinic  for the next 
scheduled visit (eg,  travel, holidays) and continued dosing is necessary, an  additional dosing 
kit may be dispensed on a case -by-case basis after submission of a  documented request and 
medical  monitor  approval .  One additional dosing kit may be dispensed to continue the 
current dose level if there are no safety concerns in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_107543]  (eg, the dose level is tolerated, no intercurrent illnesses) and the subject will 
have access to appropriate emergency medical services as needed.  Up -dosing is not allowed 
until the next clinic  visit.   
Procedures for preparation and administration of doses given in the clinic  or at home are the 
same .  Dose preparation will be completed by [CONTACT_266801] a supervising adult .  For 
in-clinic  dosing, dose preparation may be performed by [CONTACT_558296]/ caregiver  under the direct super vision of clinic  staff for the purpose of teaching and 
reinforcing training .  The capsules should be pulled apart and gently rolled between finger 
and thumb  and then  lightly tapped on each half of the capsule to ensure full delivery of 
contents .  When usin g a sachet, the sachet is to be cut over the vehicle food and the entire 
contents emptied into the food.  The sachet should then be gently squeezed and shaken to 
ensure full delivery of contents.  The contents of the capsules /sachets  will be mixed with a 
vehicle food, such as apple sauce, yogurt, p udding, or other palatable, age -appropriate food .

hours after dosing .   
• Subjects are to avoid  activities likely to in crease allergic reactivity (eg,  exercising or 
takin g hot showers or baths within 3  hours after dosing) .   
• Dosing  should also not occur within 2  hours of bedtime .   
• If a subject has engaged in strenuous exercise  before the planned  dosing  time, dosing 
must be delayed until any signs  of a hypermetabolic state (eg,  flushing, sweating, 
rapid breathing, and/or rapid heart rate) have abated .   
• For subjects aged 1  to < 4 years:  In case of illness with or without fever, or 
symptoms such as wheezing, worsening asthma, vomiting, or diarrhea, the 
parent/caregiver is to withhold the dose of study product from the subject and notify 
the study site of the symptoms and for possible dose adjustments.   
Except as may be necessary in the course of treating an AE, it is crucial that the subject take s

5.6 Drug Accountability  
According to Title  21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312 .62) and 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinic al Practice (GCP) Guideline, the 
investigator is required to maintain adequate records of the disposition of IP, including the 
date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispensed (subject -by-subject 
accounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug accid entally or deliberately destroyed .   
Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by [CONTACT_3452] .  
A drug-dispensing log will be kept current for each subject .  This log will contain the 
identification of each subject and the da te and quantity of IP dispensed  and returned .   
All records regarding the disposition of the IP will be available for review by [CONTACT_558297] .

occurring between clinic visits  in the diary log .  AR101 doses lost or destroyed at home will 
also be recorded in the diary log .   
All used  and unused  AR101  wallets and sachet containers  should be returned  to the clinic  at 
each visit .   
The study site personnel  will provide [ADDRESS_733044] .   
Treatment compliance procedures may be affected by a pandemic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], or other 
emergency not related to the study as described in  Appendix  12.   
5.8 Treatment of Overdose  
Any dose of AR101 greater than the prescribed dose within 1 calendar day will be considered 
an overdose .   
The sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an ove rdose .  The treatment should 
be based on any observed signs and symptoms .   
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should perform the following activities:  
• Contact a medical monitor as soon as possible  
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE  and report as appropriate ( Section  8.2).

5.9.1 Prophylactic Medications  
Although symptomatic treatment for chronic/r ecurrent AEs are permitted (eg,  H1 or H2 
histamine blockers, proton pump inhibitors, or beta -adrenergic agonists) , such medications 
should, in ge neral, not be routinely started in advance of symptoms; however, exceptions can 
be granted on a case -by-case basis following a mandatory discussion between the 
investigator and the medical monitor .  If started, the use of these medications should be 
minimi zed and then discontinued at the earliest medically appropriate opportunity .

oxygen, or steroids, as indicated .  Specific guidance about pharmacological and supportive 
treatments related to dosing reactions is provid ed in Section  6.9.   
Subjects and parents/ caregivers  are likely to have an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528] -injector device, but for 
those who do not, an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528] -injector device will be provided .  The expi[INVESTIGATOR_558243] -injectors should be tracked by [CONTACT_558299] s or

medical record that the subject or parent/ caregiver  has an unexpi[INVESTIGATOR_558244]-injection device and has been trained in its proper usage , including injection technique .   
5.9.3 Symptomatic Treatment for Chronic and/or Recurrent Adverse Events  
Symptomatic treatment for chronic/recurrent AEs is permitted ( except for  prohibited 
medications [ Section  5.9.5 ]) but should be used to supplement dose reduction, not substitute 
for it .  It is advised that an attempt to withdraw symptomatic t herapy be made prior to dose 
re-escalation .  If unsuccessful,  symptomatic therapy may be resumed and dose escalation 
may proceed with the symptomatic therapy in place .

5.9.4 Contraception  
Subjects undergoing OIT are at increased risk for allergic reactions and may be at increased 
risk for anaphylaxis .  Anaphylaxis can c ause a dangerous drop in blood pressure ( BP); if this 
were to occur during pregnancy, it could result in compromised placental perfusion and 
significant risk to the fetus .   
Pregnancy is a time when the mother’s immune system undergoes complex and incomple tely 
understood changes that are believed to reduce the risk of a maternal immune reaction 
directed against the fetus .  It is also a time when the fetus’s immune system is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] .  
Oral immunotherapy, at its core, entails repeated stimulation of the im mune system to affect 
changes in its makeu p and function .  The effects OIT -induced changes in the immune system 
might have on the course of pregnancy or fetal development are currently unknown .  
Accord ingly, sexually active female subjects of child bearing potential are required to practice 
effective birth control for the duration of the current study .   
Investigators must ensure that a ll female subjects who are post menarchal are provided with 
age-appropriate counse ling and information about contraception, including adequate 
information about the use, effectiveness,  and side -effects of contraceptive methods , using 
sensitivity and a  patient -centered approach, and in a private setting where possible .   
Sexually active female subjects  of childbearing potential will be required to use one of the 
following types of contraception :  
• A highly effective method of birth control, defined as one that results in a lo w failure 
rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when u sed consistently and correctly,  as follows:  
– Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
– Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibiti on of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, or implantable)  
– Intrauterine device (IUD)  
– Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
– Bilateral tubal occlusion  
– Vasectomized partner  
– Sexual abstinence  
• If a highly effective single method of birth control is not used, a n effective, 
double -barrier method of contraception should be used (eg, male condom in 
conjunction with a cervical cap, diaphragm, or contraceptive sponge  with spermicide ) 
Where local requirements are more stringent , a highly effectiv e method of birth control  must 
be used .

5.9.5 Prohibited Medications  
Use of the following medications is prohibited during the study , except during the follow -up 
observation period : 
• Use of any therapeutic antibody or any other immunomodulatory therapy , including 
any other OIT or initiation of any new aeroallergen therapy  
• Systemic corticosteroids used for longer  than 3 consecutive weeks throughout the 
study  (if used, subjects must not be up -dosed during the [ADDRESS_733047] dose of 
oral steroids ) 
• Oral b eta-blockers  
• Angiotensi n-converting enzyme inhibitors  
• Angiotensin -receptor blockers  
• Calcium channel blockers  
• Tricyclic antidepressants  
During the study, subjects may be at increased risk for anaphylaxis, which in severe form can 
result in a drop in BP .  Additionally, the administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_558245] a sudden rise in BP .  For these reasons, the risks accompanying the use of any 
medication with known cardiovascular side effects must be weighed against the potential 
benefi ts of peanut OIT .  This assessment must be performed for any medications being taken 
at study entry or added during  the study .  The use of medication with known cardiovascular 
side effects during the study is discouraged; however, if an investigator deems such use 
necessary, it must be undertaken with caution .  It is beyond the scope of this protocol to list 
all drugs with cardiovascular side effects .  Classes of drugs with a high potential for 
cardiovascular side effects include  antipsychotics, cyclooxygen ase-2 inhibitors (chronic use), 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (chronic use), antiarrhythmics, antihypertensives, and 
antineoplastics .  Before a drug with cardiovascular side effects is used in conjunction with 
OIT, the investigator should discuss it s use with a medical monitor .   
It is beyond the scope of this protocol to list all immunomodulatory drugs; broadly, these 
include drugs to treat or prevent transplant rejection, autoimmune di sease, and certain 
neoplasias  (eg, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, anti tumor necro sis alpha drugs, and other 
anti-cytokine drugs ), as well as other allerg en immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  If an investigator 
contemplates the use of a potentially immunomodulatory drug during the study, the 
investigator should discuss this wi th a medical monitor .

6.5.1 Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire s & Food Allergy Independent 
Measure Questionnaire s 
The FAQLQ are questionnaire s that measure health -related QoL in patients with food  
allergy .  The following versions of the FAQLQ forms have been developed .   
• Children 8 to 12 years of age (FAQLQ -CF) ( Flokstra -de Blok,  2009 ) 
• Adolescent s 13 to 17 years of age (FAQLQ -TF) ( Flokstra -de Blok,  2008 ) 
• Adults 18  years of age and older  (FAQLQ -AF) ( van der Velde,  2009 ) 
• Parents/ caregivers  of allergic children (FAQLQ -PF) ( DunnGalvin,  2008 ) 
• Parents/ caregivers  of allergic  teenagers  (FAQLQ -PFT)  
Each subject or parent/ caregiver  should complete the s ame version of the form comp leted in 
the parent  study , regardless of current age .   
For subjects aged ≤ 12 years, the parent/ caregiver  will complete the FAQLQ -PF.  For 
subjects completing the FAQLQ -CF, subjects and parents /caregiver  should be instructed to 
have the child provide his/her  own responses .  The parent /caregiver  can help read the 
question or explain the meaning of the question, but the response should be selected only by 
[CONTACT_2252] .   
The questionnaire s include 4 domains  common to each  (allergy avoidance , dietary 
restrictions, emotional impact and r isk of accident al exposure ), and the adult form also 
includes a f ood allergy related health  domain .  The number of i tems ranges from  23 to  29.  
Each item is scored on a 7 -point scale from 0  (no impact) to 6  (extreme impact ).   
The FAIM questionnaires were  developed to measure construct validity of the FAQLQ .  The 
FAIM questionnaires consist of [ADDRESS_733063]’s perception of 
disease severity and their expectation of allergen exposure outcome .  The FAIM may be used 
within a  study to  check the construct  validity of the FAQLQ and explore changes in subject 
and parent/ caregiver  expectation of outcome ( van der Velde,  2010 ).  Each question is s cored 
on a 7-point scale from 0  (low li kelihood of a bad outcome) to 6  (extremely likely to have  a 
bad outcome) .   
6.5.2 Food Allergy Quality of Life -Parental Burden  
The FAQL -PB is a 17-item self -administered questionnaire that measures QoL in caregivers 
for children with food allergy  (Cohen,  2004 ).  Each of the 17  questions is a 7 -point Likert 
item, and the index is  scored as a  summated r ating scale, with a higher FAQL -PB score 
indicating a worse QoL .

reported.   
The initial step in evaluating the safety and tolerability of a dose o r dose level is to determine 
how the dose was administered and under what clinical circumstances (eg, intercurrent AE, 
presence of a cofactor).  The investigator must determine the severity of the reported or 
observed symptoms related to dosing using judgm ent and the CoFAR grading system for 
hypersensitivity AEs as a guide ( Appendix  9).  Once determined, the severity of allergic 
symptoms elicited at a  particular AR101 dose will define the tolerability of that AR101 dose.  
In turn, the determination of tolerability will decide the course of action to be taken in 
response to reactions related to dosing.  The period of the study and the locat ion of the dose 
administration are also important in determining the next course of action, as illustrated in 
Figure  7 and summarized in text sections  to follow and elsewhere in the protocol.   
Certain allergy symptoms may be difficult to interpret  in subjects aged <  4 years depending 
on their stage of development .  Subtle symptoms may include ear pi[INVESTIGATOR_41875], tongue rubbing, 
putting a  hand in the mouth, an d neck scratching ( Bird,  2017 ).  Other symptoms of allergic 
reaction may include persistent rubbing of the nose or eyes, irritability, clinging to the 
parent/caregiver, inconsolable crying, somnolence, and drawing legs up to the abdomen.  The

Allergy symptoms may be difficult to interpret  in subjects aged <  4 years depending on their stage of 
development .  Age -appropriate allergy symptoms should be considered when assessing the tolerability 
of a dose.   
a Mild, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms lasting several days may be not tolerated ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
 
In general, the severity of an allergic reaction will correspond to the maximum severity of 
any of its symptoms as follows:  
• No symptoms :  If a dose elicits no symptoms, the dose will be assessed as tol erated .   
• Mild symptoms :  When dosing with AR101 elicits an acute reaction characterized by 
[CONTACT_266809] a mild symptom(s), the investigator will be required to assess 
whether the dose was or was not tolerated .  The determination of tolerability must be 
made based on  clinical judgment .  The following are presented as guidelines for 
determining whether a dose associated with the emergence of a mild sympt om or 
symptoms was tolerated .  A dose eliciting only mild symptoms may be considered to 
be toler ated if the symptoms are  as follows :  
– Isolated to a single organ system  
– Resolve with no pharmaceutical intervention or with ≤ 2 doses of oral H1 
antihistamine  
– Do not require administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  
– Are not worsening in intensity or distribution over  time 
– Resolve, or shows definite  signs of resolving, in under 1  hour 
– Do not include objective wheezing  
Based on experience from phase  [ADDRESS_733065] common potentially allergic 
symptoms to occur on a  subacute, chronic, and/or recurrent basis  in phase  2 and  3 
clinical studies of AR101 .  If an allergic response to dosing is chara cterized by [CONTACT_558303] (eg, has mild symptoms occurring 
in 2 or more organ systems, requires treatment wit h 3 doses of oral H1 antihistamine 
or 1 dose epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], shows progression in severity or distribution over time, is 
protracted in duration, or includes objective wheezing), then even though the allergic 
symptoms may be mild, the dose should be assessed as not tolerated .  If a dose 
administered at home is suspected to have been not tolerated, even based on  mild 
ARC008 CSR Final

Aimmune Therapeutics  AR101  ARC008 Protocol Amend 6.[ADDRESS_733066] be recorded in the 
source documents .   
The recurrence of a mild symptom(s) over the  course of several days of home dosing 
should suggest that the dose level is not tolerated, even if each individual occurrence 
of symptoms could be assessed as tolerated, based on the criteria listed above .  
Further explanation follows; chronic/recurrent GI symptoms are given special 
consideration:  
– If the study site is notified of mild symptoms relat ed to dosing on [ADDRESS_733067] observation for assessment of the tolerability of the dose level.   
– If mild symptoms related to dosing occur in the absence of an intercurrent illness 
and are noted on 7  or more occasions during a 2 -week dosing interval at a given 
dose level on QD dosing, that dose level should be considered not tolerated and 
appropriate acti on taken ( Section  6.9).   
– Likewise, for Treatment Pathway  1 subjects on nondaily dosing regimens, if mild 
symptoms related to dosing occur in the absence of an intercurrent AE and are 
noted on ≥  50% of the doses g iven over any 6 -week period, that dose regimen 
should be considered not tolerated and appropriate action taken (see below).   
– For any subject having chronic/recurrent GI symptoms, especially upper GI 
symptoms, investigators are advised to have a low thresh old for instituting a dose 
reduction and/or for considering early discontinuation of affected subjects from 
the study even if mild, owing to the potential for EoE .  Further specific 
instructions for this AEI can be found in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .   
• Moderate symptoms :  In general, if a dose elicits moderate symptoms, the dose will 
be assessed as not tolerated .  However, there may be rare occasions when a do se 
eliciting moderate symptoms could be assessed as tolerated .  This would only be the 
case for a  transient, self -limited (requiring no intervention and resolving completely) 
symptom occurring in a single organ system .  In addition, the symptom would be 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_266757] .  Any dose associated with moderate symptoms and assessed 
as tolerated must be accompanied by a brief explanation in the source document s as 
to why the dose was considered tolerated .   
• Severe symptoms :  If a dose elicits severe sy mptoms, the dose will be assessed as not 
tolerated .  Whenever a dose elicits an allergic response characteri zed by [ADDRESS_733068] should 
continue in the study, dosing at a reduced dose level, or be discontinued early from 
the study .   
Nondaily regimens (QOD, BIW, QW, or QOW) in Treatment Pathway  1 previously tolerated 
may eventually not be tolerated in ARC008.  The inability to tolerate a  nondaily regimen is

determined based on the criteria in Table  9.  Mild, chronic GI symptoms may also be 
considered not to lerated ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Once a nondaily regimen in Treatment Pathway  [ADDRESS_733069] 2 t o down -dose and then 
undergo the modified dose -escalation procedure to a target of 300  mg QD; alternatively, the 
subject may be withdrawn from the study.   
6.8.3 Dose Adjustment in Response to Intercurrent AEs (All Treatment Pathways)  
Emerging evidence from prev iously published OIT literature and phase  [ADDRESS_733070] AR101 doses are 
administered at home, sites are advised to educate subjects and families a bout these cofactors 
(some of which are AEs), as they may first become aware of an intercurrent AE that could 
create safety concerns.  Subjects and/or caregivers should be encouraged to withhold the dose 
and call the study center for guidance if an intercu rrent AE develops during the study.  
Occasionally the AE may only become clinically evident after the dose has already been 
given.  In both cases, dose adjustments may be necessary and are discussed further below.   
At the investigator’s discretion, tempor ary dose reductions ranging from a 1 -step decrement 
(ie, to the previous dose) to approximately half of the current dose level (to the nearest 
feasible available whole dose) can be instituted as part of the treatment regimen for an 
intercurrent AE.  Also, if a pattern of decreased tolerability of study product during menses is 
discerned, then a temporary dose reduction can be instituted during this time.   
As an alternative to dose reduction, AR101 may also be temporarily withheld at the 
investigator’s discretion, in response to an inte rcurrent AE .  In some cases (eg , when the 
intercurrent AE is clinically significant) this may be the most appropriate course of action .  
Dosing after missed or withheld doses should follow the guidance provi ded in Section  5.4.   
A schematic showing procedures for temporary dose reductions due to intercurrent AEs is 
provided in  Figure  8; explanatory text follows the figure .

Initial Escalati on (Treatment Pathways  3 and  5) and Up -Dosing (Treatment Pathways 2, 3, 
and 5) Periods, and periodically during the Maintenance Period (all Treatment Pathways).  
These doses are administered under direct observation in monitored settings, and only after 
study procedures that ensure the subject is in general baseline health (eg, a physical 
examination and PEF).  If a subject has a dose escalation in the clinic without symptoms, the 
action should be to continue, per protocol, with daily home dosing at the tol erated dose level 
and return to the clinic for the next scheduled visit.  However, if symptoms arise in the clinic 
after observed dosing, the investigator will determine whether the dose was tolerated 
(Section  6.8.2 ).  The process algorithm for continued dosing after symptoms related to dosing 
occur in the clinic depends on the study period and is described below and shown in Figure  8.   
Allergy symptoms may be difficult to interpret in subjects aged <  [ADDRESS_733074] dosing.   
6.9.1 Management of In -Clinic Symptoms Related to Dosing During Initial Escalation 
Period (Treatment Pathway s 3 and 5) 
The algorithm for responding to acute allergic sympto ms during the in -clinic Initial 
Escalation, Day  1, is shown in Figure  9.  Explanatory text follows the figure .   
An Aimmune medical monitor will be available to answer any questions or to assist in any 
decisions related to the study protocol .  Investigator judgme nt will be required to determine 
the best course of action, with possible actions as shown below:  
• Extending the time interval between dosing (up to an additional 30  minutes) without 
any additional treatment  
• Instituting enhanced clinical monitoring .  This could include (though is not limited to) 
more frequent vital sign monitoring (including respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), auscultation, and/or 
the addition of pulse oximetry  
• Treating with antihistamine and then re suming dose escalation within [ADDRESS_733075] dose, if  assessed as safe  
• Treating additionally with epi[INVESTIGATOR_114138], inhaled beta-agonist, oxygen, IV fluids,

treat symptoms related to dosing, even in the unlikely event that the symptoms are 
graded as mild, will be cause to terminate the  initial escalation .   
• Moderate symptoms :  For moderate symptoms , if the symptoms are not worsening 
or amassing at a rapid pace, then a stepwise approach to treatment may be taken at the 
discretion of the investigator .  If the first action undertaken is to  implement an 
observation period, the observation period should not exceed  [ADDRESS_733076] 
with antihistamines or immediately with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1275] .  Other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_558251], per 
investigator judgment .   
If moderate symptoms occur at any of the doses below 6 mg (ie, up to and including 
3 mg), then  the desensitization procedure will be discontinued .  The decision to 
discontinue escalation is to be based solely on the determination of whether the 
allergic re action was of moderate severity .  Although it is generally the case that 
some form of treatment will be instituted for moderate symptoms, treatment is not a 
requirement for assessing an allergic reaction as being of moderate severity .   
• Severe symptoms :  For severe symptoms , the actions taken should be to discontinue 
the initial escalation and administer the appropriate rescue medications .  The 
desensitization procedure will be discontinued regardless of the dose at which the 
severe symptom or symptoms occu rred.   
6.9.2 Management of In -Clinic Symptoms Related to Dosing During Up -Dosing 
Period (Treatment Pathways 2 , 3, and  5):  First Dose Tolerated at New Dose 
Level  
The scenarios listed below describe a subject in the Up -Dosing Period who has symptoms but 
is consi dered to have tolerated the first dose at a new dose level .  The procedures outlined for 
each scenario should be followed .   
• No symptoms :  If a subject undergoes up-dosing at the study site  without symptoms, 
the action should be to continue, per protocol, with daily home dosing at the tolerated 
dose level and return to the study site for the next sc heduled dose escalation visit 
2 weeks later .   
• Oral/pharyngeal pruritus only :  If the subject experiences oral/pharyngeal pruritus  
only following the administrat ion of the first dose at a new dose level, the dose will 
generally be assessed as tolerated , and the same dose can be repeated the next day at 
home and continued throughout the  2-week home -dosing interval, unless other 
symptoms indicative of lack of tolera bility begin to develop ( Section  6.9).   
• Mild symptoms tolerated at first dose at new dose level :  If mild symptoms  
(Section  6.8) occur with the first dose at a new dose level and the dose is assessed as 
tolerated , the action taken should be to repeat the same dose the next day .  It is 
advised that the repeat (next day’s) dose be administered at the study site , but it may 
be given at home, at the investigator’s  discretion .  If the second dose at the new 
(increased) dose level is tolerated without symptoms, then the subject is to continue

discontinue study treatment .   
• Moderate symptoms (these indicate lack of tolerability, with rare exceptions) :  On 
rare occasions, a transient, self -limited (requiring no intervention and resolving 
completely) symptom of mo derate intensity occurr ing in a  single organ system  may 
be assessed as tolerated .  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_558253] .  Any dose 
associated with  moderate symptoms  and assessed as tolerated must be accompanied 
by a brief explanation in the CRF as to why the dose was considered tolerated; (see 
Section  6.8.2 , for moderate symptoms assessed as tolerated):  If moderate symptoms  
occur with the first dose at a new dose level, except for rare instances, the dose will 
be assessed as not tolerated .  The action taken should be to have the subject return 
the next day for dosing at the last tolerated dose under medical supervision  at the 
study site .  If this reduced dose elicits no allergic symptoms (ie, is well tolerated), the 
subject will continue on that daily home dose level for an additional [ADDRESS_733080] e xperiences mild symptoms at the reduced dose, the procedures for 
responding to a dose with mild symptoms should be followed (see above) .  If the 
subject experiences moderate symptoms at the reduced dose level, the subject should 
return the n ext day and rec eive a further 1 - or 2-step dose reduction (per investigator 
judgment)  at the study site .  If this reduced dose is well tolerated, it will be continued 
as the daily home dose for ≥  2 weeks before re -escalation is attempted at the study 
site.  If the dose is not well tolerated, but elicits mild symptoms, then the treatment 
procedures for respondi ng to mild symptoms should be followed (see above) .  If, 
however, the subject again experiences moderate symptoms at the reduced dose level, 
a discussion with the medical monitor is to ensue to reach a decision as to whether to 
continue the subject in the study .   
In the rare instance that a dose eliciting moderate symptoms is assessed as tolerated , 
then the actions taken should be the same as for a dose with mild symptoms  assessed 
as tolerated .   
• Severe symptoms (these always indicate lack of tolerability) :  If severe symptoms  
occur, the action should be to treat the subject for the allergic reaction, and then, in 
consultation with the medical monitor , decide whether to discontinue the subject from 
the study .  If it is determined that it is safe to allow th e subject to continue in the 
study, the subject should return the next day for dosing at  a 2-step reduction in dose 
under observation  at the study site .  If the subject tolerates the dose reduction (ie, 
shows no or only mild symptoms that are assessed as t olerated), then the subject is to

Severe symptoms requiring ≥ 2 doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]:  If a subject exper iences severe

paragraph should be followed; however, dosing will proceed at the reduced dose level 
(if tolera ted) for at least [ADDRESS_733084] Dose (Treatment Pathways 2 , 3, and  5) 
Whereas the Initial Escalation Period occurs exclusively at the study site , most doses of 
AR101 will be given at home  during the Up -Dosing and Maintenance Periods of ARC008 .  
With the occurrence of symptoms of an acute reaction to AR101 after home dosing, or any 
acute allergic reaction, subjects or parents/caregivers are instructed to call the study site 
personnel.  When symptoms of an allergic reaction related to dosing are reported during the 
course of dail y home -dosing in any period, the investigator must assess the severity of the 
reaction and whether the dose associated with the reaction was tolerated (Table  9).  Because 
of the reduced reliability inherent in the second -hand reporting of symptoms, investigators 
are strongly encouraged to have subjects return to the clinic to undergo dosing under direct 
observation whenever acute allergic symptoms associ ated with dosing are reported.  If a 
previously tolerated dose or dose level is subsequently assessed as not tolerated , the action 
taken will depend on the type and severity of the reaction related to dosing and the 
investigator’s clinical judgment.  The f ollowing possible actions are described and also 
shown in Figure 10: 
• Dosing the subject under medical supervision at the study site  – this is encoura ged 
whenever there is question as to the tolerability of a dose level .  It may be performed 
at the current dose level or at a reduced dose level, if there is already a high index of 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_558254] .   
• Holding dose level at current level for an additional 1 to 2 weeks before attempting 
dose escalation  – this may be done at the discretion of the investigator if there is 
concern that the current dose level has not been sufficiently well tolerated to attemp t 
up-dosing to the next dose level .   
• Reducing dose by 1 or 2 dose levels and maintaining the reduced dose level for 
2- to 4-week period before attempting dose re -escalation – Generally, this should be 
the action taken when a dose that has been observed at the study site  is assessed as 
not tolerated, if a dose elicits moderately severe symptoms, if a single dose of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_558255] a dosing reaction, or if the investigator is 
convinced of the intolerability of the current dose leve l.  In short, it should be 
considered the default action whenever a dose or dose level is assessed as not 
tolerated .   
ARC008 CSR Final

Aimmune Therapeutics  AR101  ARC008 Protocol Amend 6.0  
22 Dec 2020  - FINAL  Aimmune Confidential Information  
• Reducing dose level for less than the usual 2 -week period  – this may be instituted as 
treatment for an intercurrent AE, to aid the invest igator in determining if a dose level 
is or is not tolerated, or if a pattern of decreased study product tolerability during 
menses is discerned .  The level of the reduction in dose, ranging from a 1 -step 
reduction to a 50% reduction will be at the investi gator’s discretion, based on clinical 
judgment .  The manner in which dose escalation may resume will depend on the level 
and the duration of the dose reduction .   
• Temporarily withholding study product dosing  – this may be instituted as treatment 
for an int ercurrent AE or to aid the investigator in determining if a dose level is or is 
not tolerated, but the duration of withholding study product may not exceed 
[ADDRESS_733085] depends on 
the duration for which dosing was withheld .   
• Reducing dose by 2 dose levels and maintaining the reduced dose level for 
≥ 6 weeks  – continuing dosing at a reduced dose level for ≥  6 weeks pri or to 
attempting re -escalation is mandatory if 2 doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_558256] a

that the subject may elect anytime and for any reason.  The inves tigator must 
discontinue the subject from further dosing and continuation in the study under 
circumstances that could jeopardize the health of the subject or the integrity of the 
study.   
For any subject having chronic/recurrent GI symptoms, especially upp er GI symptoms, 
investigators are advised to have a low threshold for instituting a dose reduction and/or for 
considering early discontinuation of affected subjects from the study even if mild, owing to

indicated .   
Many mild acute allergic reactions can b e transient and self -limiting, requiring no 
therapeutic intervention .  Others, however, may require treatment .  Generally, for 
mild symptoms requiring treatment, the subject should receive antihistamines .   
• Acute allergic reactions manifesting with moderat e symptoms will generally require 
therapeutic intervention, although some, even moderate, symptoms may on rare 
occasion be so transient as to require no specific treatment .  Generally, for moderate 
symptoms requiring treatment, the subjects should receive antihistamines and/or

8.1.3 Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is any event that results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Life-threatening AE (life-threatening means that the study subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_266764], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred) 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_558266], but may jeopardize the health of the study subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent oneof the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious event
It is anticipated that the most likely cause of SAEs in this study will be anaphylaxis; however, not all occurrences of anaphylaxis are necessarily SAEs. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_733152]
AEIs include anaphylaxis, GI AEs with prolonged dose interruption (> 7 consecutive days) 
or that result in early discontinuation, accidental and nonaccidental food allergen exposure, 
severe adverse events, and use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  Allergic reactions during food challenges will 
not be considered related to study product or reported as AEIs.  
AEIs will be reported to the Safety Reporting Center within 24 hours of the study site 
personnel’s knowledge of the event, regardless of the investigator assessment of the 
relationship of the event to study product.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis and systemic allergic reaction are synonymous terms in this study.  In AR101 
clinical program reporting (eg, in the AR101 investigator brochure), anaphylaxis refers only 
to severe systemic allergic reactions.  
Anaphylactic AEs will be considered AEIs.  Anaphylaxis is defined by a number of signs and symptoms that occur alone or in combination within minutes up to a few hours after exposure to a provoking agent.  Anaphylaxis can be mild, moderate, or severe in this study.  Most 
cases are mild, but any event of anaphylaxis has the potential to become life-threatening.  The clinical criteria for defining anaphylaxis have been adopted for this study from the second symposium on the definition and management of anaphylaxis of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (Sampson, 2006), and are consistent with the international consensus on anaphylaxis 
(Simons, 2011).  ARC008 CSR Final
Aimmune Therapeutics  AR101  ARC008 Protocol Amend 6.[ADDRESS_733153] to the inclusion of being potentially life -threaten ing in the definition of 
anaphylaxis and how that relates to the assessment of anaphylaxis as an SAE, reference is 
made to the  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting in the ICH E2A Tripartite 
Guideline , which  states the following:  
An adverse ev ent or suspected a dverse reaction is considered life-threatening  if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate 
risk of death .  It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe  form, might have caused death .   
Thus, for the reporting of anaphylaxis as an SAE, the severity of the reaction, assessed 
according to the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology ( EAACI ) system 
for grading the s everity of anaphylactic reactions ( Muraro,  2007 ), is also to be taken into 
account ( Sectio n [IP_ADDRESS]  and Appendix  8).   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Gastrointestinal A Es Resulting in Prolonged Interruption of Dosin g 
Gastrointestinal AEs, typi[INVESTIGATOR_155650]/recurrent GI AEs, that result in prolonged interruption 
of dosing will also be considered AEIs and will be assessed longitudinally according to the 
procedures described below.  EoE presents with varied symptoms of esophageal dysfunction 
that differ between children and adults ( Dellon,  2011 ; Dellon,  2013 ).  In children, the 
symptoms are often nonspecific and may include feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, 
abdominal pain, regurgitation, nausea, and vomiting.  In adults, the most frequent symptoms 
are dysphagia and food impaction; less frequent symptom s include heartburn, chest pain, 
abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  Special attention should be paid to these symptoms, 
which may suggest esophageal dysfunction, particularly when the symptoms are new in onset 
during the study, chronic or recurrent, or experienced as a complex of multiple symptoms.   
To delineate these AEIs, prolonged interruption of dosing is defined as withholding AR101 
for >  7 days.  This will include 3  categories of subjects:  
• Any subject whose dose is withheld for >  7 days due to GI AEs and resumes dosing 
at a reduced dose level  
• Any subject who develops chronic/recurrent GI AEs at or before reaching the 20  mg 
dose level and resumes dosing after a 30 -day dosing hiatus  
• Any subject who experienced GI AEs and discontinues early from the  study  
Subjects with GI AEIs will be asked to complete the PEESS  v2.0 questionnaire 
(Franciosi,  2011 ) while the subject is symptomatic, at the End of Treatment visit, and then 
monthly for 6  months thereafter.  Parents/caregivers will also complete the PEES S v2.0 as 
appropriate.  It should be noted that the PEESS v2.0 was not designed to establish a diagnosis 
of EoE; the use of the PEESS v2.[ADDRESS_733154] validity 
(Franciosi,  2011 ; Martin,  2015 ) and holds promise for being a valuable tool to follow the 
clinical course of EoE or an EoE -like immune -mediated GI syndrome.  The PEESS v2.[ADDRESS_733155] symptomatic improvement or wo rsening that might otherwise go 
undetected.   
Subjects who discontinue AR101 treatment early due to chronic/recurrent GI A Es will be 
requested to return to the clinic for evaluation monthly for at least 6  months (if the subject is 
asymptomatic, telephone f ollow -up with a physician inv estigator may substitute for in -clinic 
visit, at the investigator’s discretion) .  If chronic/recurrent GI A Es persist beyond 6  months, 
subjects will continue to be followed with monthly clinic visits  (telephone follow -up with a n 
investigator may substitute for in -clinic visit, at the investigator’s discretion)  until the 
symptoms have resolved or are assessed to have stabilized with optimal medical 
management .   
If chronic/recurrent GI AEs do not completely resolve within [ADDRESS_733156] should be referred to a  (pediatric) gastroenterologist.  Subjects 
with EoE confirmed by [CONTACT_558310] -up monthly for at least 6  months or 
until resolution of symptoms and/or tissue eosino philia, whichever is last.   
If a subject who discontinued AR101 treatment early due to chronic/recurrent GI AEs is 
unable to discontinue the use of symptomatic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_558267] (eg, H1 
or H2 histamine blockers or proton pump inhibit ors) by [ADDRESS_733157] should be referred to a (pediatric) gastroenterologist.   
As is the case for any AE occurring during the study, for chronic/recurrent GI A Es, the 
investigator may use discretion  anytim e to request consultation from an outside physician or 
additional testing to assist in the diagnosis or management of the AE .   
If a subject is seen by a gastroenterologist, the study site will attempt to procure records of 
the visit as well as any test results including those from endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy, if 
performed .  These results  will be  retained with the subject’s medical notes .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Accidental and Nonaccidental Food Allergen Exposures  
An accidental food allergen exposure is any known or s uspected exposure to a food to which 
the subject is allergic, including peanut, whether or not it results in an AE .  A nonaccidental 
food allergen exposure is an intentional exposure to a food to which the subject is allergic, 
including peanut, whether or not it results in an AE.   
Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_558311], even if it does not cause symptoms .  The subject 
may be asked to return to the site .  These ev ents will be reported as follows:  
• The n onserious AEI form will be completed for each of these events, in addition to

[IP_ADDRESS]  Asses sment of Severity  
The investigator will assign severity grades to A Es.  Depending on the type of AE, the 
following severity grading systems will be used in this study :  
• The severity of anaphylactic reactions will be graded according to the EAACI system 
for grading the severity of anaphylactic reactions  (Appendix  8).   
• The severity of allergic reactions will be graded according to the definitions 
developed by [CONTACT_266817]  (Appendix  9).   
• The severity of all other  AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) system .  
The purpose of using the NCI -CTCAE system is to provide standard language to 
describe A Es (“toxicities”) and to facilitate ta bulation and analysis of the data and for 
assessment of the clinic al significance of treatment -related toxicities .  The NCI -
CTCAE provides a term and a grade that closely describes the AE .  Each 
participating site will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_266771] .  For 
additional information and a printable version of the NCI -CTCAE v .4.03 manual, 
consult the NCI -CTCAE website, http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.   
• AEs not included in the NCI -CTCAE listing  will also to  be graded on a scale from  1 
to 5, according to the se general grade definitions :  
– Grade  1 (Mild):   Tran sient or mild discomforts (<  48 hours), no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy required, hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_266772] 
(nonprescription or single -use prescripti on therapy may be em ployed to relieve 
symptoms (eg,  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_266773], acetami nophen for post surgical pain)  
– Grade  2 (Moderate):   Mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance

– Grade  3 (Severe):   Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually 
required, medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841]  
– Grade  4 (Life -threatening):   Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance 
required, significant medical/therapy intervention required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_244502]  
– Grade  5 (Death)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of  Causality (Relatedness)  
The investigator will use the following criteria when assessing causality of an AE to AR101 : 
Related  There is a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event.  
Not Related  There is NOT a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event.  
AEs assessed as not related require an asse ssment of alternative causality.  
AE = adverse event.  
 
ARC008 CSR Final

Aimmune Therapeutics  AR101  ARC008 Protocol Amend 6.[ADDRESS_733161] .  SAEs will be 
recorded in the electronic data capture (EDC) system .  The site will al so report an SAE to the 
Safety Reporting Center within 24  hours of the site’s knowledge of the event using an SAE 
report form.   
If the ICF for ARC008 is signed before the prior study exit visit, SAEs will be reported in the 
prior study until the time of t he Screening/Baseline visit in ARC008.  Thereafter, SAEs will 
be reported in ARC008.   
If the investigator becomes aware of an  SAE with a suspected causal relationship to AR101 
that occurs within [ADDRESS_733162] AR101 dose, the investigator will report it to the 
sponsor.   
The following attributes will be included in an SAE report :  
• Description  
• Date of onset and resolution (if known when reported)  
• Severity  
• Assessment of relatedness to test article  
• Action taken  
The investigator will apply clinical ju dgment to determine whether an AE is of sufficient 
severity to require discontinuation of AR101.  If necessary, an investigator will suspend any 
study procedures and institute the necessary medical therapy to protect a subject from any 
immediate danger.   
Subsequent review by [CONTACT_12721], the sponsor’s internal safety risk management 
team, IRBs/ECs, or the sponsor may suspend further study treatment or procedures at a site.

Allergic reactions during food challenges that meet the criteria for serious will be reported as 
related to the procedure.   
8.[ADDRESS_733163] be 
reported to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis.  The final decision for disposition 
regarding expedited reporting to the regulatory authorities rests with a medical monitor.  The 
sponsor will provide the Safety Reporting Center with copi[INVESTIGATOR_558269].   
The sponsor will expedite the repor ting to all concerned investigator(s), IRBs/ECs, where 
required, and to the national regulatory authorities of all suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) in accordance with ICH E6 5.16.2 and 5.17.1.  In addition, such 
expedited reports will comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and with the ICH 
E2A Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for 
Expedited Reporting and ICH E6 5.17.2.   
The Safety Reporting Center will provide these expedited report s to each investigator.  SAEs 
that are considered related to AR101 and are unexpected will be reported to regulatory 
authorities within 15  days or for deaths and life -threatening events within 7  days (in 
accordance with applicable regulatory reporting requ irements).   
The sponsor will submit to the regulatory authorities all safety updates and periodic reports, 
as required by [CONTACT_266819]  E6 5.17.3 and ICH  E2F.    
Once a year throughout the clinical study , the sponsor will  provide  a listing of all S[LOCATION_003]R s

10.2 Access to Data  
The study sites will periodically permit authorized representatives of the study sponsor or 
regulatory authorities to examine clinical records and other medical notes for the purpose of 
safety monitoring, qualit y assurance review, audit, or evaluation of the study progress 
throughout the entire study period.  The investigator is required by [CONTACT_266821] (21  CFR  312.62, EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, and ICH  GCP) to keep 
accurate case rec ords for at least [ADDRESS_733167] of the study, or if no application is to be filed 
or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2  years after the in vestigation is

This study will be conducted using current GCP, as delineated in the 21  CFR Par ts 50, 54, 
and 312 and in the ICH  GCP, national and international regulations and directives as 
appropriate, and according to the study protocol.  Before study initiation, the protocol and the 
informed consent and assent documents will be reviewed and appr oved by [CONTACT_413578]/EC and the applicable regulatory authority of each country in which the study is 
conducted.  Any amendment to the protocol must also be approved by [CONTACT_206087]/EC, and be submitted to the applicable regulatory authorities  before it is implemented.

Aimmune Therapeutics  AR101  ARC008 Protocol Amend 6.[ADDRESS_733169] and/or parent/guardian will be allowed as much time as needed to review the 
document(s) and consider participation in the study.  The investigator will review the 
consent/assent, answer any qu estions, and emphasize the need to avoid allergen exposure 
other than AR101 and the necessity to continue AR101 dosing to maintain desensitization.  
The prospective subject and/or pediatric subject’s parent/guardian will be told that being in 
the study is voluntary and that the subject may withdraw from the study anytime and for any 
reason.  Adult subjects and parents/guardians of pediatric subjects will each sign the ICF, and 
pediatric subjects will each sign the assent form, as required by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  Wh ere required 
by [CONTACT_50844], both parents must sign the consent form before a child can be enrolled in 
the study.  The subject or subject’s parent/guardian must be given a copy of the signed and 
dated ICF and assent form, if used.  Written informed c onsent and assent must be obtained 
before any study -related procedure is performed.   
Informed consent/assent materials will be translated into appropriate languages for subjects 
and parents/guardians who do not speak or read English .  The informed consent /assent form 
will be evaluated for revision whenever the protocol is amended or new safety information 
becomes available .   
Informed consent and assent procedures may be affected by a pandemic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], or other 
emergency not related to the study as descr ibed in  Appendix  12.   
11.[ADDRESS_733170]’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study .  Each 
subject will  be assigned a sequential identification number , and these numbers rather than 
names will be used to collect, store, and report subject information .   
11.4 Study Monitoring  
Before the start of the study, the sponso r’s monitor will meet with the i nvestigator and 
appropriate study site staff for training on the protocol requirements and procedures .   
Throughout the course of the study, the sponsor’s monitor will conduct site visits to verify 
that the rights and well -being of the subjects are protect ed; the reported study  data are 
accurate, complete, and verifiable from medical notes ; and that the conduct of the study  is in 
compliance with the currently approved protocol, GCP, and applicable regulatory and legal 
requirements .   
Study monitoring may be  affected by a pandemic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], or other emergency  not related 
to the study  as described in Appendix  12.   
11.[ADDRESS_733171], although every effort should be made to discuss this 
with the sponsor’s medical monitor beforehand .   
Protocol deviations must be clearly documented, including the reasons for the deviations .  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_152592] r reporting protocol deviations in accordance with 
their local IRBs/IECs requirements .   
13.1 Reporting and Managing Protocol Deviations  
The study site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_393241], document, and report 
protocol deviations and appro priate corrective and prevent ive action plans ; however, protocol 
deviations may also be identified during site monitoring visits or during other forms of study 
conduct review .   
All protocol deviations will be reported in accordance with the protocol devia tion plan .

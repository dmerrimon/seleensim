Objectives:  
 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative single dose 
gabapentin for subjects undergoing a minimally invasive  hysterectomy in 
management of acute postoperative pain.   The study will  compare the effectiveness, 
and s ide effects of preoperative provision of three non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_799090] 
(acetaminophen, celecoxib, and gabapentin) compared with acetaminophen and 
celecoxib  alone (without gabapentin).  As providing the least medication and lowest 
doses is consistent wi th best medical practices, we propose to assess whether 
provision of gabapentin does or does not provide significant reduction of post -
operative pain above and beyond oral acetaminophen and celecoxib . We aim to 
assess efficacy with dual primary outcomes of  reduction in  24 hour numeric analog 
scale (NAS)  and reduction in 24 hour narcotic use.  
 
Hypothesis:  
 
We hypothesize a single preoperative dose of gabapentin [ADDRESS_1102138] 35% and reduce the [ADDRESS_1102139] 25%  compared with preoperative acetaminophen and celecoxib  alone .  These 
effects are clinically meaningful, while conservatively lower than those found by 
[CONTACT_799096] (2014).   
 
Background:  
 
Multimodal postoperative analgesia after a hysterectomy has been mainly based on 
a combination of nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  However, 
adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, sedation, and pruritus may limit use of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]  (Dolin 2005) .  As the side effects are dose related, minimizing opi[INVESTIGATOR_799091].  Thus, there has been an interest in 
evaluating preemptive as well as post -operative administration of non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] . 
Additional regimens have bee n suggested to minimize  opi[INVESTIGATOR_799092] , epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187],  and 
anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin  or pregabalin (Tiippana 2007).  
 
Gabapentin, a widely used  anticonvulsant used for treatment of neuropathic pain, 
has recently been suggested to improve postoperative analgesia and reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_799093].  Gabapentin is thought to modulate calcium channels on the 
presynaptic nociceptive neurons, which in turn  modulate or inhibit the release of 
excitatory neurotransmitters from activated nociceptors  (Schmidt et al 2013) .  In 
NCT 02703259  
Date: February 12, [ADDRESS_1102140] by 
[CONTACT_799097] (Schmidt et al. 2013).  
 
Many studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of gabapentin for 
perioperative use in a variety of  procedures  across disciplines  including 
thoracotomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy, major orthopedic 
surger y, cesarean sections, and abdominal hysterectomy  (Tiippana 2007).  Several 
randomized trials have evaluated the effects of gabapentin administered 
preoperatively only as well as given pre - and postoperatively for hysterectomy.  In a 
systematic review of 14  studies conducted between 2004 and 2013, with samples 
ranging from 40 to 200, Alayed et al. (2014) identified 8 trials in which gabapentin 
was administered only preoperatively to reduce pain associated with abdominal 
hysterectomy surgery.  Analysis of tho se data clearly demonstrates that preemptive 
gabapentin reduced the postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score by 
[CONTACT_3450] 50% and postoperative use of morphine by [CONTACT_3450] 37%.  The 
incidence of p ruritus and dry mouth in those receiving preemptive gabapentin 
appeared similar to those receiving placebo, however there was a higher rate of 
reported dizziness (not statistically significant) associated with gabapentin.  In 
contrast, multiple postoperative doses of gabapentin in addition to the  preoperative 
dose was found to have no significant effect on VAS scores at [ADDRESS_1102141] been encouraging, uptake of gabapentin in routine 
clinical use remains limited due to mixed resu lts and variability between gabapentin 
protocols,  including dosing and duration.  Christiana Care (CCHS) plans to 
implement the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol which 
administers preoperative medications to reduce postoperative pain, includi ng 
acetaminophen, celecoxib, dexamethasone, and gabapentin.  Therefore the aim of 
this study is to assess the efficacy of a single dose of preoperative gabapentin to 
reduce  acute  postoperative pain in women undergoing a minimally invasive 
hysterectomy.  
 
Study Design:  
 
This is a double -blind,  randomized controlled trial with a balanced 1:[ADDRESS_1102142] deviation equivalent to 50% of the average of both study 
groups ( three  medications including gabapentin compared to  two medications 
exclu ding gabapentin), a samp le of [ADDRESS_1102143], α=0.05, 1 -β=90%.  Assuming that the two primary outcomes are 
80% correlated, a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons increases the 
sample size by 2 people per group.  Therefore , in case of missing information  and/or 
NCT 02703259  
Date: February 12, [ADDRESS_1102144] should analyses controlled for confounding be necessary , the 
study plans to e nroll 67  women per study group .   
 
 
Study Participants:  
 
Our study population  will include  all females undergoing a minimally invasive 
hysterectomy with surgeons operating within the Christiana Care at the Newark 
location only .  Participants will be included if they are at least 18 years of age and 
undergoing hysterectomy for any indication via a minimally invasive appro ach – 
vaginal, laparoscopic , and/or robotic -assisted . 
 
Participants will be excluded if they decline to participate, have a known history of 
liver or renal failure, a history of gastric by[CONTACT_6476], gastroparesis, recent or current 
regular gabapentin use, or a hyperse nsitivity to gabapentin, acetominophen , or 
celecoxib , or procedure is converted to laparotomy for any indication . Mini -
laparotom y for specimen removal alone will  not be excluded . 
 
Consents will be requested from eligible  subjects  in the office setting at the time of 
scheduling their hysterectomy.  Consenting participants will then be randomized 
into the experimental or  control study group stratified by  [CONTACT_7995] , to eliminate bias 
associated w ith provider experience .   The preoperat ive medications will be 
administered [ADDRESS_1102145] preoperative care and medications per 
protocol at Christiana Care.  
 
 
Study Protocol:  
 
1. Procedure  
Eligible pa rticipants w ill be approached and voluntary informed consent will 
be requested  in the office setting at the time of their preoperative visit.  
Consent ing subjects will then be randomized on the day of surgery to either 
the experimental or control group by [CONTACT_23164].  The study 
will use concealed envelop random allocation in which each group will be 
identified by [CONTACT_799098] (X or Y); the identity of the study group 
allocation will be maintained in a locked file by [CONTACT_799099][INVESTIGATOR_799094] , Nancy Sloan,  and will 
not be revealed except to and if directed by [CONTACT_55569].   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_7995] .  While in the preoperative prep aration  and hold 
area, subjects will complete a survey to assess a baseline pa in score.  To 
support double -blind implementation, pe rioperative nurses  will administer 
routine preoperative medications approximately [ADDRESS_1102146] 02703259

support purchase of visually identical placebos, the study will support the 
double blind design by [CONTACT_799100] o f capsules to both study 
groups. Subjects in the control arm will receive acetominophen  975 mg  
(three tablets of acetaminophen 325 mg) and c elecoxib 400 mg  (four 
capsules of celecoxib 100 mg)  orally.  Subjects  in the study arm will receive 
gabapentin 600 m g (two capsules of gabapentin 300mg) , acetaminophen 975 
mg (three tablets of acetaminophen 325 mg), and c elecoxib 400 mg  (two 
capsules of celecoxib 200 mg)  orally.  Thus, b oth the experimental  and 
contr ol group s will receive three tablets and four capsules  for periope rative 
oral medications to support the double blind design .  Subjects will undergo 
their scheduled minimally invasive surgery as per routine by [CONTACT_799101].   Surgeons will be encouraged to administer 20 cc local 0.25% 
Marcaine distri buted equally among all incision sites.  
 
Postoperatively , subjects will continue to receive the standard of care as 
performed by [CONTACT_799102].  Recovery and 
floor nurses will continue to manage patient care as routine, incl uding 
assessing for patient pain immediately post operatively and at routine time 
points postoperatively until discharge , using either the verbal numerical 
rating scale or the Wong -Baker FACES pain rating scale.  Subjects discharged 
prior to 24 hours will report their pain rating and narcotic medication use via 
telephone follow -up from a research coordinator .  Up to 3 telephone calls will 
be made to maximize follow -up. 
 
Subjects will also  receive a phone call  2 weeks postoperatively  to assess pain, 
postoper ative narcotic use, and potential side  effects.

Method of Analysis:  
The study data will be entered into an MS Access database that will be maintained 
on the protected CCHS computer system and approved encrypted thumb drives.  
Descriptive statistics using chi -square for categorical and Student's t -tests for 
continuous variables, with Fisher's continuity correction for analyses with fewer 
than 5 subjects in any cell will be reported.  Linear (for continuous outcome) and 
logistic (for categorical variables) regression analyses will be conducted  to adjust 
for confounding factors  and assess mediation of effect (for example, associated with 
surgical complications) . 
 
Risks/Benefits:  
 
The Christiana Care Institutional Review Bo ard wil l review this study protocol.  T he 
study will be registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov  prior to enrollment of its first 
patient .  Voluntary informed consent for study participation will be requested of all 
eligib le women undergoing a minimally invasive  hysterectomy for any indication.  
This study carries a small risk regarding breech of  confidentiality, as protected 
health information will be collected.  However information will be kept coded and 
secure in accordance w ith CCHS data security measures and  REDCap software.    
 
There is a potential risk for side effects from gabapentin administration including 
temporary  dizziness/drowsiness, fatigue, loss of balance , blurry vision, 
tremulousness, swelling, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and allergic reaction , however 
these side effects are rare .  Risk s of side  effects from gabapentin are also minimal as 
NCT 02703259  
Date: February 12, 2016  
 
the study will only administer a  single dose.  Potential benefits include improved 
postoperative pain management, less narcotic use, and decreased  postoperativ e 
nausea and vomiting.

Page 6PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Rationale:
Signaling through the (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) PI3K pathway is associated with 
resistance to a variety of anti-tumor agents.  This has been described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with varying mechanisms of action including taxanes, and (deoxyribonucleic acid) DNA-damaging agents.  In the clinic, activated PI3K pathway in tumors has been correlated with decreased response to therapy and worse clinical outcomes.
In addition to resistance to cytotoxic agents, there is also evidence of PI3K signaling 
affecting sensitivity of cells to epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) family signaling inhibitors.  Specifically, the activation of PI3K in tumors has been associated with a worse outcome in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents. In addition, pre-clinical studies have described the role of the PI3K pathway in EGFR activation in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and have demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors can reverse resistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor models.
Collectively, these findings suggest that PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
inhibitors may increase the efficacy of both chemotherapeutic agents which are considered standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of several solid tumors and dacomitinib which has shown clinical activity in several tumor types.

Page 9Study Design:
This is a Phase 1b, three-arm, open-label, multi-center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of PF-[ADDRESS_1266926] advanced solid tumors.  Successive cohorts of patients will receive selected doses of PF-05212384 in combination with selected doses of chemotherapeutic agents (docetaxel and cisplatin) or dacomitinib in 3 independent arms on an outpatient basis.  Based on the tolerability of PF-05212384 at higher doses in other (monotherapy) studies, the study will test increasing doses of PF-05212384 in combination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and/or dacomitinib in order to select the best dose to administer in the MTD expansion portion of the study.  
A modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed 
DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment in Arms A and B.  The actual dose selected for the next cohort will take into account the recommended dose by [CONTACT_903289] [INVESTIGATOR_903246].  In Arm C in order to evaluate concurrent doses of dacomitinib in combination with two concurrent doses of PF-05212384, a zone-based design will be utilized, which is a modified 3+3 design that potentially allows opening of more than one dose level at the same time.
35  In all arms, dose escalation will 
proceed until an MTD (or two MTDs) is declared, or the Maximum Allowable Dose is reached.
On April 1, 2015, [COMPANY_007] Inc. has decided to stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the 
B2151002 clinical trial.  Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to enter the study after notification of the decision.  Due to closure, the MTD of those combinations will not be established.  All references to objectives, endpoints, study design, assessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of patients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for Arm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C).  The decision is based on the company’s change in prioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory interactions.
For Arm B, the study was originally designed as a dose escalation study with no expansion 
cohorts.  However, Protocol Amendment 5 includes the rationale and description for the safety and efficacy expansion with PF-05212384 plus cisplatin in patients with metastatic or 
locally-recurrent/advanced TNBC. A total of [ADDRESS_1266927] been shown to be sensitive. 090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

To understand the single-dose safety and single dose PK of the study drug, a lead in period 
will be included.  A single lead-in dose of PF-05212384 will be given either 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arms A and B) or 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arm C). The lead in period duration, subsequent doses, regimens and PK time-points may be modified based on the PK profile observed during the lead in period.  Patients will then receive study treatment on an outpatient basis as 21 day cycles.  OC090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Page 11Treatment with study drug will continue until progression of disease, uncontrollable toxicity, 
a decision by [CONTACT_903290], or the study is terminated.  Patients experiencing toxicity may be managed with dose modification or discontinuation.  If a patient discontinues PF-05212384 or the combination partner (cisplatin, docetaxel or dacomitinib) due to toxicity which is specific to either agent, continuation of patient treatment within the study with single agent PF-05212384, cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis. 
Statistical Method:
The MTD estimation in Arms A and B employs the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_903247]. The mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_241641] a Bayesian method with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity increases as dose increases.  For Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.  This is a 3+[ADDRESS_1266928] 30 patients.090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by [CONTACT_1744]/IECs or  if required by [CONTACT_13125].
15.ECG: Triplicate 12-lead ECG (per institutional practice) will be performed .  At each time point, three consecutive 12-lead ECGs will  be performed 
approximately 2 minutes apart to determine mean QTc interval using Fredericia’s correction formula.  ECGs will be collected as f ollows: 
•Within [ADDRESS_1266937] dose of study treatment;
•Cycle 1 Day 2, immediately prior to completion of PF-05212384 infusion;
•Cycle 2 Day 1, immediately prior to completion of PF-05212384 infusion;

Page 17The ECG should be collected prior to scheduled PK collections; the timing of the PK collections over rides the timing for ECG co llections (ie, if a PK 
sample is scheduled at [ADDRESS_1266938] prior to  the hour PK collection, 
and the PK sample should be collected at the nominal time).  If the patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specificall y syncope, dizziness, 
seizures, or stroke) an ECG should be obtained at time of the event.  See Section 7 for additional considerations regarding ECG.  If the mean QTc is 
prolonged (value of ≥500 msec), the ECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified person at the institution for confirmation. Additional ECGs may be 
performed as clinically indicated.
16.Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ARM C:   LVEF will be measured at baseline, the end of Cycle 3, end of Cycle 6, and then every 6 cycles for 
Arm C patients only.  It will be measured by [CONTACT_652675] (ECHO) or multi-gated radionucleide study (MUGA), with the sa me technique used 
throughout the study for an individual patient.  If an absolute decrease in LVEF of greater than 20% is noted by [CONTACT_903293], then the LVEF will 
be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if available); if the decrease is verified further, interr uption of treatment for futher 
cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the judgment of Investigator.  In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction or 
LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that patient may benefit from ongoing therapy.  For any pati ent discontinuing therapy 
for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular dysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4 month interval to as sess for resolution is 
recommended.
17.Tumor Assessments: Tumor assessments will be performed every 6 weeks ( ±5 days) while the patient is receiving treatment regardless of treatment delays. 
Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites.  Imaging may include chest, abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI s cans.  A thoracic CT 
scan should be performed at every tumor assessment independent of lung involvement and in the absence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].  Brain scans and bone 
scans will be performed at baseline if disease is suspected and on-study as appropriate to follow disease. Baseline CNS imaging  is not required with the 
exception of symptomatic patients to rule out CNS metastases. Given the exploratory nature of the study, confirmation of response  (CR/PR) is not required 
but can be collected.  Tumor assessment should be repeated at the end of treatment visit if more than [ADDRESS_1266939] evaluation.  For 
those patients who discontinue for reasons other than progression of disease, tumor assessments should continue until progressi on of disease is documented. 
In patients continuing on study for >[ADDRESS_1266940] experienced manageable toxicity and stable disease, the interval between  imaging assessments may 
be modified from every 6 weeks ( ±5 days) to every 9 weeks ( ±5 days) if the Investigator determines it is in the best interest of the patient, and after 
discussion and approval by [CONTACT_1034].  The modification will decrease the burden on the patients and sites, while still ensur ing adequate monitoring for 
safety and efficacy. 
18.Adverse Event (AE) Assessments: AEs should be documented and recorded at each visit using NCI CTC AE version 4.03 ( Appendix 3 ).  Patients must be 
followed for AEs for [ADDRESS_1266941] resolved, whichev er is later; or earlier than 
28 days should the patient commence another anticancer therapy within that time frame.  For SAEs, the active reporting period to  [COMPANY_007] or its designated 
representative begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s partic ipation in the study, ie, prior to 
undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including [ADDRESS_1266942].  SAEs occurring after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the In vestigator becomes aware of 
them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the Investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study dru g are to be reported to the 
Sponsor.
19.Concomitant Medications: All concomitant medications should be recorded in the CRF including supportive care drugs (eg, anti-emetic treatment and 
prophylaxis), and the drugs used to treat adverse events or chronic diseases.090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

22.PK Sampling: Details on sampling are provided in the Schedule of STUDY TREATMENTS andPharmacokinetics Assessments .  
23.Archival tumor biopsy for biomarker analysis: All patients will be required to provide an archived tumor biopsy formalin fixed paraffin embedded
(FFPE) sample.  If an archived tumor sample is not available, patients must consent to provide a fresh biopsy FFPE for purpose of this analysis.  Patients 
may not be enrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample.  For the tumor biopsy sample, par affin blocks are preferred, 
but freshly cut slides are acceptable.  Details for handling of these samples including processing, storage, and shipment will b e provided in the Study 
Manual.  Collection of archival tissue post announcement of [COMPANY_007]’s decision to close Arm A and C is at the discretion of the i nvestigator (in the event 
archival tissue is not available, a fresh biopsy is no longer required).  The requirement for collection of archival tissue for  patients enrolling in Arm B 
remains unchanged.
24.Paired tumor biopsies for pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers (see Section 7.3 ):Fresh FFPE tumor biopsies will be requested at Screening (within 
28 days of study treatment start) and on Cycle [ADDRESS_1266943] 
inhibition and for PD biomarker studies across doses.  The paired tumor biopsy will be mandatory for patients enrolled in the MT D cohort unless it poses a 
safety risk to the patient in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_903248]. Tumor biopsies collected at End  of Treatment are optional, but 
are highly desired, for a proteomics-based evaluation of possible resistance mechanisms to PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Detail s for handling of these 
samples including processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in the Study Manual.  
 
 
26.End of treatment visit: Obtain these assessments if not completed in the last week (last 6 weeks for tumor assessments).
27.Follow up: At least [ADDRESS_1266944] every 4 weeks until resolution or determination, in the clinical judgment of t he Investigator, that no further 
improvement is expected.  For those patients who discontinue for reasons other than progression of disease, tumor assessments sh ould continue until

Page 361. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Indication – Original Protocol through Amendment 4
PF-05212384 in combination with other anti-tumor agents (docetaxel, cisplatin, and 
dacomitinib) is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor being developed for use in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.
1.2. Indication – Amendment 5
PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin is being developed for use in adult woman with 
metastatic or locally-recurrent/advanced triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC) in first- through third-lines of therapy.
1.3. Background 
1.3.1. PI3K/mTOR 
PI3Ks constitute a lipid kinase family involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, 
including proliferation, survival, cytoskeletal organization, and glucose transport.
1  PI3K 
enzymes catalyze the formation of the second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates many target proteins, most notably phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1).  The downstream targets of these protein kinases, such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD) and forkhead box O proteins (FOXOs), mediate most of the proliferation, growth and survival signaling from PI3Ks ( Figure 3 ).
2,3Activation of the PI3K pathway has 
been implicated in a wide variety of human cancers.  Mutations in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA) , the gene 
encoding the catalytic subunit of PI3K, are very common in human cancers, having been observed in prostate, and colorectal tumors, among others.  Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion, leading to activation of Akt has been observed in many types of malignancies including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and glioma.

Page 37Figure 3. PI3K/mTOR and EGFR Signaling Pathways
Inhibitors of mTOR are in development for the treatment of cancers, most of these agents are 
analogs of rapamycin, which specifically inhibit the activity of the TORC1 complex.5,6  
Analogs of rapamycin such as CCI-779 (temsirolimus) and RAD-001 (everolimus) have been shown to provide benefit to patients for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.  However, specific inhibition of TORC1 results in a feedback stimulation of Akt and thus inhibition of TORC1 alone may be inferior to inhibition of PI3K and both TORC complexes.

The role of human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (HER) family members HER-1 (epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR)), HER-2 (neu/c-erb-2), and HER-3 in many cancer types is well documented.  One or more of the members of this receptor family are expressed in over 90% of solid tumors and approximately 60% of those tumors possess abnormalities in this family that potentially contribute to their neoplastic phenotype.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Preclinical Data for PF-05212384
PF-05212384 has been shown to cause tumor growth inhibition as well as tumor regressions 
in a variety of human xenograft tumor models (Table 1).  In vivo biomarker studies demonstrated that PF-05212384 suppressed PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling as evidenced by [CONTACT_903297].  These studies were done in MDA361 (human breast) tumor xenografts propagated in nude mice.  In this model, pAKT at position T308 was suppressed for 8 hours with PF-05212384 at a dose of 25 mg/kg.  Additionally, increased cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), a marker for apoptosis, was observed which 
correlated  with the tumor regression.

Page 391.3.3. PF-05212384 Clinical Experience
PF-05212384 has been evaluated in one completed Phase 1 clinical trial in adult patients with 
solid cancer, and is being evaluated in two ongoing clinical trials (one Phase 1b study in 
combination with irinotecan, and one Phase 2 study in endometrial cancer as single agent).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Phase 1 Study of PF-05212384 Single Agent in Patients with Advanced Solid 
Tumors (B2151001)
The first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 trial, B2151001 evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of single agent PF-05212384 in patients with advanced solid tumors.  PF-05212384 doses ranging from 10 mg to 319 mg weekly were administered to a total of 77 patients using a continuous reassessment method (CRM) to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The MTD was decared to be 154 mg, a dose level at which patients received a median number of 7 weekly doses (range 1-24).  In general treatment with single agent PF-05212384 was well tolerated over multiple cycles of treatment. Table 2 includes the number of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) that occurred during the active treatment phase with PF-05212384.  
Most DLTs occurred at dose levels above the MTD.
Treatment-related adverse events are summarized in Table [ADDRESS_1266977] common 
treatment-related AEs at the MTD (154 mg) were mucosal inflammation and nausea, which were reported in nearly half of the patients (42.9% and 40.5%, respectively), followed by [CONTACT_157710] (26.2%), vomiting (23.8%), and asthenia, decreased appetite, and fatigue (21.4% each). Dysgeusia (19.0%), AST increase, and diarrhea (14.3% each) were also frequent adverse events associated with treatment with PF-05212384.  To be noted, although hyperglycemia was reported as an AE in 26.2% of patients at the MTD, the chemistry data showed hyperglycemia in 78.6% of patients treated at the MTD of PF-05212384, although mainly of Grades 1 and 2 (71.4% of all patients treated at the MTD); 3 (7.1%) patients had 
Grade 3 hyperglycemia.
Three patients discontinued treatment with PF-05212384 due to treatment related adverse 
events (one patient with increased ALT at the 319 mg dose level, and two patients with mucositis at the 222 mg and 319 mg dose levels, respectively).

Clearance of PF-05212384 is linear with dose, and distribution is relatively high.  Plasma concentrations of PF-05212384 exceeded the 50% of maximal inhibition (IC50) of PI3K and mTOR dependent phosphorylation events for 
approximately 70 hours at doses of 89 and 154 mg, and for ≥120 hours at the 266 mg and 
319 mg dose.  The target concentration was based on projected human plasma concentration 
from xenograft models where analysis of xenograft tumor tissue showed a greater than 50% suppression of pAKT and an induction of cleaved PARP, an indicator of cellular commitment to apoptosis.  
To date, partial responses (PR) have been observed in 2 patients (NSCLC with liver and lung

1.3.4. Docetaxel
Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane whose mechanism of action is to promote tubulin 
assembly in microtubules and to inhibit their depolymerization which causes cells to arrest in mitosis and eventually undergo apoptosis.  Docetaxel is effective in a wide variety of solid tumors and is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with breast, lung, hormone-refractory prostate, gastric, and head and neck tumors. Docetaxel doses range from 60-100 mg/m
2depending on the 
indication and are administered as an infusion every three weeks.  Notable toxicities include fluid retention and hypersensitivity reactions.

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. PF-05212384 Plus Cisplatin in Patients with TNBC
The rationale for combining cisplatin with PF-05212384 in patients with metastatic or 
locally-recurrent/advanced triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC) is two-fold: First, there is amplified genomic instability of TNBC tumor cells, leading to an increased vulnerability of TNBC to DNA-damaging agents, such as cisplatin.  TNBC tumor cells harbor activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene, making these cells excellent targets for inhibition of the PI3K pathway using pathway inhibitors, such as PF-05212384.
46
In addition, some fraction of TNBC tumor cells (~20%) harbor mutations in the DNA repair genes breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer 2 (BRCA2), suggesting a functional deficit in the process of homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA. The inability to repair DNA efficiently makes these cells particularly susceptible to the DNA cross-link strand breaks caused by [CONTACT_903301], like cisplatin.
40,46
The use of cisplatin in combination regimens in patients with TNBC has shown improved 
rates of tumor response in both the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting.40,50  As such, recent 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network®(NCCN) guidelines for treatment of metastatic 
TNBC have included platinum salts, such as cisplatin.51
The above information provides a sound rationale for combining PF-05212384 with cisplatin 
in the treatment of patients with metastatic TNBC.
1.3.6. Dacomitinib (PF-00299804)
The investigational agent dacomitinib is an orally available, selective ATP-competitive 
irreversible small-molecule inhibitor of Human Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14907] (HER, erbB) family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).  This family of RTKs includes the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR, HER-1), HER-2 receptor (erbB2), and HER-4 (erbB4) receptor and their oncogenic variants (ie, EGFR exon 19 deletion, EGFR L858R point mutation, and EGFR T790M mutation).  Dacomitinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the HER family through binding at the adenose triphosphate (ATP) binding site, which results in covalent modification of a cystine in the ATP binding pocket. HER-[ADDRESS_1266985] been investigated as possible favorable predictors of clinical efficacy and, in particular, it has been shown that patients with certain mutations of EGFR (exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations) have significant benefit from EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI).  Dacomitinib is being developed for patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC).
Dacomitinib given orally without food in the FIH dose escalation study, A7471001, was 
absorbed with a median time to the maximum observed concentration (T

14-65%.  There was no evidence of increasing trough concentrations with time when examining available predose concentrations on Cycle 2 Day 1, 8, and 14 in a limited number of patients (n=2-4) at 45 mg.  To date, the terminal t
½has been characterized in patients at 
45 mg, and ranged from 75 to 110 hour with a mean of approximately 85 hours.  
Dacomitinib is metabolized in part by [CONTACT_9058] P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and an active 
metabolite, PF-05199265, is formed.  Dacomitinib also inhibits the CYP2D6 metabolic pathway.  Collectively results from clinical studies suggest that dacomitinib may increase exposure of other drugs primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6 and therefore administration of drugs which are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism may require dose adjustment, or substitution with an alternative medication.  Dacomitinib is mainly eliminated by [CONTACT_903299].
Dacomitinib is currently in Phase [ADDRESS_1266987] been enrolled and treated in 13 clinical trials evaluating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of dacomitinib.  Of these 1503 patients, 579 patients were administered dacomitinib as single agent, 466 patients received either dacomitinib or placebo as double-blinded therapy, 293 patients received either dacomitinib or erlotinib as double-blinded therapy, 71 patients received dacomitinib in combination with CP-751,871 (figitumumab).  Patients have also been treated with dacomitinib in combination with crizotinib.
Complete information for dacomitinib may be found in the SRSD, which for this study is the

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Combinations
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Docetaxel
Docetaxel is a microtubule inhibitor which is active in a number of human solid tumors.  In 
pre-clinical in vitro studies, the combination of docetaxel and a PI3K inhibitor resulted in 
additive and even synergistic activity in a variety of human cancer cell lines.  In vivo
experiments revealed enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with the combination.[ADDRESS_1266992] demonstrated that the combination of PF-05212384 and docetaxel is more effective than either drug alone (Figure 4).  Finally, patients with tumors with activated PI3K/Akt signaling have been shown to be less responsive to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents including docetaxel and paclitaxel.
17,[ADDRESS_1266993] that 
the addition of PF-05212384 to docetaxel may lead to enhanced antitumor effects in patients.

[IP_ADDRESS].2. Cisplatin
Cisplatin is an alkylating agent which cross-links DNA.  Preclinically, the combination of 
PI3K inhibitor and cisplatin resulted in synergistic anti-tumor activity in human ovarian cancer cell models.
[ADDRESS_1266994] PDX xenograft model (PJC10).  Since single-agent cisplatin is active in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) thecombination of PF-05212384 and cisplatin may be an extremely effective regimen in an area of great medical need.
24  Cisplatin is also used in combination with gemcitabine in a number 
of tumor types such as urothelial transitional cell cancers (TCC), NSCLC, and biliary tract tumors and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in ovarian cancer (OC).  090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Page 48Thus, based on the preclinical evidence of additive or synergistic activity, once the clinical 
safety and tolerability of the combination of PF-05212384 and cisplatin has been established, it may be possible to consider replacing gemcitabine with PF-05212384 in these regimens.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Dacomitinib
EGFR and HER2 are important mediators of tumorogenesis in a number of tumors and PI3K 
is a critical EGFR-dependent effector of downstream signaling.  Activation of the PI3K pathway has been shown to be associated with resistance to HER2 inhibition.  This is supported by [CONTACT_903302]2+ gastric cancer, activated PI3K signaling predicts for a worse clinical outcome.
25  Further evidence of cross-talk between the 
EGFR and PI3K pathways exists in glioblastoma and  NSCLC models.20,26In a preclinical
NSCLC model, the addition of a PI3K inhibitor to gefitinib was shown to overcome resistance to gefitinib.
20  Finally, in the H1975 lung xenograft model, tumor growth 
inhibition was observed for the combination of PF-05212384 with neratinib, a EGFR and HER2 inhibitor suggesting that the combination with the pan-HER inhibitor dacomitinib might also be beneficial (Figure 5).

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for PF-05212384 Doses
In Phase 1 study B2151001, single agent PF-05212384 at doses ranging from 10 mg to 
319 mg weekly (QW) were evaluated in 77 patients with advanced solid tumors.  The MTD was identified as 154 mg QW.  In study B1271002, PF-05212384 doses of 95, 110, and 130 mg/week were evaluated in combination with irinotecan 180 mg/m
2every 2 weeks; the 
MTD of PF-05212384 was 110 mg/week when dosed in combination with irinotecan.
In the current trial, the PF-05212384 starting dose in all 3 treatment arms will be 90 mg/week 
which is 58% of the MTD for single agent PF-[ADDRESS_1266995] dose evaluated in Phase 2 study B1271002 investigating PF-05212384 in combination with irinotecan.  In the Phase 1 FIH trial (B2151001), PF-05212384 dose of 89 mg/week (n=4) was found to result in drug concentrations above the target concentration for approximately 70 hours.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Docetaxel, Cisplatin and Dacomitinib Starting Doses
In Arm A, the starting dose of docetaxel will be 75 mg/m
2every [ADDRESS_1266996] cancer, in combination with prednisone in hormone refractory prostate cancer, and as single agent inNSCLC.
28
In Arm B, the starting dose of cisplatin will be 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks which is the dose 
often used when it is administered as an every 3 week regimen in combination with docetaxel, gemcitabine, or pemetrexed.
29,30,31
In Arm C, the starting dose of dacomitinib will be 30 mg which is 67% of the MTD for 
single agent dacomitinib when administered orally once daily on a continuous dosing schedule.  This starting dose was selected given the potential for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_903250]-05212384, such as mucositis and rash.  In the dacomitinib FIH trial in patients with advanced tumors, among 111 patients treated in dose-escalation, 13 were treated at the 30 mg/day dose level.  One DLT (mucositis) was observed in this group.  The safety profile in the specific dose levels was not reported.
32As described in the IB, the 30 mg dose has 
only been evaluated in a small number patients in subsequent trials however the 30 mg dose is generally better tolerated than the 45 mg dose. 
During the course of the trial, dose reductions for each combination will be permitted in 
individual patients who cannot tolerate the starting dose ( Section 5.2.5 ).
1.4. Overall Risk Benefit Assessment
[COMPANY_007] considers that the results of the nonclinical toxicity and safety pharmacology studies, 
together with the clinical experience obtained to date with PF-05212384 support the continued development of PF-05212384 in combination with other anti-tumor agents.  The tumor types in which these combinations will likely be used, all represent areas of high medical need. 090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

3. STUDY DESIGN
This is a Phase 1b, three-arm, open-label, multi-center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safety,
tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of PF-[ADDRESS_1266997] advanced solid tumors.  Successive cohorts of patients will receive selected doses of PF-05212384 in combination with selected doses of chemotherapeutic agents or dacomitinib in 3 independent arms on an outpatient basis.  Based on the tolerability of PF-05212384 at higher doses in other (monotherapy) studies, the study will test increasing doses of PF-05212384 in combination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and/or dacomitinib in order to select the best dose to administer in the MTD expansion portion of the study.
A modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed 
DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment in Arms A and B.
33,34  The actual dose 
selected for the next cohort will take into account the recommended dose by [CONTACT_903289] [INVESTIGATOR_903246].  In Arm C in order to evaluate concurrent doses of dacomitinib in combination with two concurrent doses of PF-05212384, a zone-based design will be utilized, which is a modified 3+3 design that potentially allows opening of more than one dose level at the same time.
35In all arms, dose escalation will 
proceed until an MTD (or two MTDs) is declared, or the Maximum Allowable Dose is reached.
On April 1, 2015, [COMPANY_007] Inc. decided to stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002 
clinical trial.  Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to enter the study after notification of the decision.  Due to closure, the MTD of those combinations will not be established.  All references to objectives, endpoints, study design, assessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of &&,090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

For Arm B, the study was originally designed as a dose escalation study with no expansion 
cohorts.  However, Protocol Amendment 5 includes the rationale and description for the safety and efficacy expansion with PF-05212384 plus cisplatin in patients with metastatic or locally-recurrent/advanced triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC).

Page 54To understand the single-dose safety and single dose PK of the study drug, a lead in period 
will be included.  A single lead-in dose of PF-05212384 will be given either 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arms A and B) or 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arm C). The lead in period duration, subsequent doses, regimens and PK time-points may be modified based on the PK profile observed during the lead in period.  Patients will then receive study treatment on an outpatient basis in 21 day cycles.  
Treatment with study drug will continue until progression of disease, uncontrollable toxicity, 
a decision by [CONTACT_903290], or the study is terminated.  Patients experiencing toxicity or a DLT may be managed with dose modification or discontinuation.  If a patient discontinues PF-05212384 or the combination partner (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib) due to toxicity which is specific to either agent, continuation of patient treatment within the study with single agent PF-05212384, cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.  
The proposed doses, schedule(s) and PK timepoints may be reconsidered and amended 
during the study based on the emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data. 
3.1. Dose Levels to Be Tested
The possible dose levels for Arms A, B, and C are shown in Table [ADDRESS_1266999] not experienced DLT at the lower 
doses will be treated at the next cohort which has been cleared for safety (the dose level has not been determined to exceed the MTD).  The decision regarding the implementation of intra-patient dose escalation in patients treated at the MTD expansion will be considered once the MTD has been identified.  090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

based on observed DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment. The statistical description of the method is provided in Section [ADDRESS_1267000] time and one of them experiences a DLT, then the recommended action for the next cohort of patients will be to stay at the current dose level (S); if this recommendation is accepted, then the selected dose level for the next cohort of patients will be A1; if a cohort of 3 additional patients are treated at dose level A1 and there are no more DLTs observed, then the cumulative number of patients treated at A1 is 6, and the cumulative number of patients with DLTs at A1 is 1, thus the recommendation would be to escalate the dose for the subsequent cohort (E).  090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Page 59As in a classical 3+3 design, dose escalation is indicated if there is no DLT in 3 patients or 
≤1 DLT in 6 patients at the current dose level.  If DLT data at dose level C1 indicates dose 
escalation, then two separate dose escalations from C1 to C2 and from C1 to C1h may occur 
simultaneously (as shown in Table 8 ).  To open dose level C2h, the DLT data from  the 
preceding two lower dose levels C2 and C1h must both indicate dose escalation, ie, no DLT 
observed in 3 patients or ≤[ADDRESS_1267002] 2 of the 3-6 patients treated at a dose level, leading to the conclusion that an MTD has been exceeded.  The planned cohort size is 3-6 patients per dose cohort however, based upon observed toxicity or unexpected clinical findings, individual dose cohorts may be expanded beyond 6 patients after discussion and review by [CONTACT_1034]’s medical monitor and the Investigators.  When a dose level exceeding an MTD has been identified, the next lower dose level is declared the MTD if [ADDRESS_1267003] rational dose level to enroll additional patients.
3.2. DLT Definition (All Arms)
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.03.  For the purpose 
of dose escalation, any of the following adverse events occurring in the first cycle of treatment (starting from the lead-in dose through Cycle 2 Day 1) which are possibly attributable to the combination will be classified as DLTs:
•Hematologic:
•Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days.
•Febrile neutropenia (defined as neutropenia ≥Grade 3 and a single body 
temperature >38.3 °C or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C for more than one 
hour).
•Grade≥3 neutropenia with infection.
•Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding.

•Grade≥2 pneumonitis.
•Grade≥[ADDRESS_1267004] not been

•Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at least [ADDRESS_1267005] cycle (including the lead-in dose).
•Arm A and B: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to 
deliver at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 during the 1
stcycle (including the 
lead-in dose).
•Arm C: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at 
least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 and 75% of dacomitinib during the 1stcycle 
(including the lead-in dose(s)). 
•Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the delay of the start of the second 
cycle by [CONTACT_726] 2 weeks relative to the scheduled start.
•In an asymptomatic patient, Grade 3 mean QTc prolongation (QTc ≥501 msec) 
will first require repeat testing, re-evaluation by a qualified person, and correction 
of reversible causes such as electrolyte abnormalities or hypoxia for confirmation.  If, after correction of any reversible causes, the Grade 3 QTc prolongation persists, then the event should be considered a DLT. 
3.3. MTD Definition
For Arms A and B, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression (refer to 
Section 9 for details) at the end of the study.  Up to a maximum of 15 patients will be treated 
at the MTD during dose finding to define the tolerability and to evaluate clinical activity.
For Arm C, upon identification of the MTD, additional patients up to a maximum of 15 will 
be treated at the MTD to better define the tolerability and to evaluate clinical activity.  
3.4. Safety and Efficacy Expansion in Patients with TNBC
Based on the rationale provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , an expansion cohort will open with 
implementation of Protocol Amendment 5 to assess the clinical activity and continued overall safety profile of PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin in patients with TNBC.  The design is shown in the Figure 8 below.
Treatment in the expansion portion of the study will continue until progression of disease, 
uncontrollable toxicity, a decision by [CONTACT_903290], or the study is terminated.  Patients experiencing toxicity may be managed with dose modification or discontinuation.  If a patient discontinues PF-05212384 or the combination 090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

3.4.1. Dose Rationale
The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) that will be used in the safety and efficacy 
expansion portion of the study is 180 mg PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin.  The determination of this dose was based on all information related to the overall safety profile, clinical activity, and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_903251].
A total of 33 patients were enrolled in Arm B at doses ranging from 90–310 mg/week in arm 
(B1–B8).  Two DLTs were first observed at the 310 mg dose level (Grade 3 oral mucositis) leading to a dose reduction to 260 mg dose level.  Rapid onset oral mucositis was then observed at the 260 mg dose level (not meeting protocol defined DLT criteria).  Therefore, the [ADDRESS_1267006] due to rapid onset oral mucositis. 
Based on safety profile at 310 mg and 260 mg, the dose level selected for additional study in 
10 patients was 215 mg.  In the 10 patients treated at 215 mg, 6 dose reductions (to 180 mg and one patient then further reduced to 150 mg) were observed in 5 patients during Cycle 1.  Five PF-05212384 Cycle 1 dosing visits were missed in 4 patients due to oral mucositis or other significant toxicities. 
Based upon this safety profile at the 215 mg dose level, the RP2D was selected as 180 mg IV 
weekly PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin (75 mg/mg
2IV q 3wks).

4.5. Life Style Guidelines
Patients will be advised to report any reaction to sun exposed skin.  In addition, special 
precautions should be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by [CONTACT_466254]’ exposure to light including high intensity UVb sources such as tanning beds, tanning booths and sunlamps.  Patients should be encouraged to apply sunscreen/sunblock daily.
In this study, patients of childbearing potential will receive PF-05212384, a compound for 
which the teratogenic risk is currently unknown.  Two (2) methods of highly effective contraception must be used throughout the study and continued for [ADDRESS_1267029] dose.  The investigator or his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two appropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of contraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use.  The investigator or his/her designee, at each study visit, will discuss with the patient the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document such conversation in the patient chart.  In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient 
to call immediately if a selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is 
known or suspected.  
Highly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and include:
1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of 
contraception are allowed provided the patient remains on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Eligible patients will be enrolled to receive one of the three study drug treatment regimens in 
an open-label, unblinded manner.  The possible dose levels are displayed in Section 3.1 .  In 
Arms A and B, a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). In 
Arm C, a modified 3+3 design is applied that potentially allows opening of more than one dose level at the same time (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Patients experiencing a DLT may be managed with dose modification or discontinuation.  
Laboratory values including complete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistry may be obtained within 72 hours of the lead-in dose and Day 1 of every subsequent cycle and reviewed to ensure appropriate values for dosing. 
The investigator’s knowledge of the treatment should not influence the decision to enroll a 
particular patient or affect the order in which patients are enrolled.
5.1.2. Safety and Efficacy Expansion in Patients with TNBC
Following full assessment and determination that the patient meets all eligibility criteria and 
has given written informed consent for study participation, the Investigator or designee will request enrollment to a specific arm based on the patient’s prior treatment.  Enrollment to a specific arm will be performed by [CONTACT_1034]. At the end of the enrollment process, a patient identification number will be assigned, which must be used on all CRF pages and on all trial-related documentation and correspondence referencing that patient.  
No patient shall receive study drug until the Investigator or designee has received the 
following information in writing from the Sponsor:
•confirmation of the patient’s enrolment; and
•specification of the arm for that patient; and 
•specification of the dose level for that patient.

Likewise, patients must be instructed that if they vomit at any time after taking a dose, they must not “make it up” with an extra dose the same day, but resume dosing the next day as prescribed.  Similar to all administered doses, any missed or vomited doses must be indicated in the source documents and CRFs.
5.2.4. Medication Errors
Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the wrong product, 
by [CONTACT_4670], at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error CRF which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) page and on the serious adverse event (SAE)form when appropriate. In the event of medication error, the Sponsor should be notified immediately.
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
•Medication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product.090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by [CONTACT_1149], as determined by [CONTACT_3786], the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the adverse event (AE) page and, if applicable, any associated adverse event(s) are captured on an adverse event (AE) CRF page.
5.2.5. Recommended Dose Modifications
Every effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule.
In the event of significant toxicity, dosing may be delayed and/or reduced as described 
below.  In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence of any adverse symptom.
Dose modifications may occur in three ways:
•Within a cycle: dose interruption/reduction until adequate recovery during a given 
treatment cycle. 
•Between cycles: next cycle administration may be postponed due to toxicity in the 
previous cycle.
•In the next cycle: dose reduction based on worst toxicity in the previous cycle. 
5.2.6. Dose Interruptions/Delay
PF-05212384
: If PF-05212384 treatment is interrupted, the days when treatment is withheld 
are counted as cycle days and missed doses are skipped.  For Arm C, the day treatment is restarted with PF-05212384 will be counted as Day 1 of the next cycle, and the previous cycle is extended accordingly.  A treatment delay or interruption of >2 consecutive weeksdue to lack of toleration will result in discontinuation of the patient from the study drug, following discussion with the Sponsor. If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities considered to be related only to PF-05212384 and not to the combination drug (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib), continuation of patient treatment within the study with the combination drug (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib) as a single agent will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.
Docetaxel
: If toxicities persist and docetaxel cannot be re-administered for >2 weeks after the 
expected administration of the subsequent cycle (>35 days from the start of docetaxel in the current cycle), the Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_903310].  For Arm A, the day treatment is restarted with docetaxel will be counted as Day 1 of the next cycle, and the previous cycle is extended accordingly.  If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities considered to be related only to docetaxel and not to PF-05212384, continuation of patient treatment within the study with PF-05212384 as a single agent will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Suggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this 
study.  These criteria are provided as guidance only.  Decisions on dose reduction and resumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.
Arms A and B
:  Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of 
PF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once adequate recovery is achieved.  Chemotherapy (ie, docetaxel and cisplatin) should bemaintained at the starting dose unless a chemotherapy-related toxicity mandates a dose reduction. Possible dose levels of PF-05212384 according to study arm are shown in Table 9 .  Recommended dose reductions for PF-05212384, docetaxel and cisplatin are shown 
in Table 10 , Table 11 and Table 12 , respectively.090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

The Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial 
drug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  Under no circumstances should the Investigator or other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or clinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by [CONTACT_903314].  [COMPANY_007] may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or may approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form).  In either case, the forms must identify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition on a patient by [CONTACT_486020], including specific dates and quantities.  The forms must be signed by [CONTACT_47510], and copi[INVESTIGATOR_407540].  
Adequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs 
must be kept.  Study drug (vials and tablets) must be used according to the protocol directions.  The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form.  To ensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form and drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by [CONTACT_4618].  Unless otherwise authorized by [CONTACT_4618], at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by [CONTACT_903315] (eg, CRO).  If [COMPANY_007] authorizes destruction at the trial site, the Investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by [CONTACT_4618].  Destruction must be adequately documented.
Investigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by 
[CONTACT_345911]) and ensure that thermometers are working correctly as required for proper storage of investigational products.  These include thermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage.  Any temperature excursions should be reported to the sponsor. 
The investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.  Once a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until the Sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.
Storage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet

Palliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the 
Investigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines.
37All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as 
interventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by [CONTACT_903317].
Primary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimu lating factors is not permitted but they 
may be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by [CONTACT_274208].
Patients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the 
treatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug.  Initiation of bisphosphonate therapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise agreed by [CONTACT_116333]. 
Patients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients 
on study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with warfarin be initiated.
Additionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used  but should be discontinued 24 hours prior to administration of PF-05212384.  It can be re-initiated 24 hours after the end of PF-05212384 infusion.
Patients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.The docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may 
apply for concomitant medications. 
5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4
In all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.

Therefore co-administration of study drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted from 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384 until study treatment discontinuation.
5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)
Dacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30 ng/mL).  
Drug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on 
the systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of the CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg, procainamide, pi[INVESTIGATOR_903256].
The use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires 
consideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.  Substitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions below should be followed. 
•For drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should 
be based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting 
dose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with dacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.
•For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high 
likelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose 
reduction is required when starting dacomitinib, but clinical monitoring is required; based on the patient’s response, dose reductions may be necessary.
•Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,
should be replaced with an alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to the pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their exposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_903257], hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as substitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Concurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a

toxicities.

5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs
No additional anti-tumor therapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy. 
Additionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.
Low dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisone or <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or 
luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s 
discretion for patients with CRPC on Arm A.  
5.4.6. Supportive Care 
Palliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the 
lesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigator clearly indicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression.  Inview of the current lack of data about the interaction of the investigational agents PF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 5 days before and resuming treatment after recovery 
of any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline. 
Medication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used 
at the Investigator’s discretion.  
5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors
The use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia 
will be permitted for Cycle 1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2 onwards,according to local guidelines.  In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006 
should be followed.

Chronic, systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5 mg/day or 
dexamethasone ≥2 mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A.  Treatment with 
docetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids.  Also, low

5.4.10. Oral Mucositis – Prophylaxis and Management 
Oral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin 
combination.  The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for prevention of oral mucositis.  These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to begin pre-dose on Cycle [ADDRESS_1267054] not had a dental checkup within 6 months prior to start of dosing are 
encouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent chemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to undertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to proceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation. 
To decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid 
containing “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5 mg/[ADDRESS_1267055] swallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oralpain.

any trial specific procedures.  Trial procedures are described in the Section 7 and in the 
Schedule of Activities .  Safety laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, 
coagulation) and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day 1 visit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic visit.
Other tests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed 
for patient management depending on findings emerging from the study.  The results of these additional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF. 
6.1. Screening
All patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed 
consent form prior to performing any trial related procedures that are not standard of care.  The Investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_737], will explain the benefits and risks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial witness, and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before initiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).
The final ICD must be agreed to by [CONTACT_903318] 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) in language readily understood by [CONTACT_102].  The Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by [CONTACT_37410]’s legal representative, and by [CONTACT_28490].
This protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial 
enrollment and the first dose of study drug  (See Schedule of activities and its footnotes).  
Required screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_1267057] be performed within 28 days (unless otherwise specified) prior to 
commencing study treatment, as outlined on the schedule of activities .  Baseline tumor 
biopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities , Footnote 23) and if the patient 
has consented to a fresh tumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the start of study treatment.  Study treatment start is considered 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arms A and B) or 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arm C). 090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

history, including ongoing concomitant medications, clinical assessments (including vital signs, height, body weight, ECOG performance status, baseline signs and symptoms, and triplicate 12-lead resting ECG), MUGA or ECHO (Arm C patients), and tumor assessments.
Documentation of tumor history (Primary Diagnosis) should include histological or 
cytological classification, stage information, treatment history (surgery, systemic treatment and radiotherapy) as well as duration and best response to immediate prior regimen, tumor grade, histologic subtype, and relevant tumor-specific molecular markers, if available (eg, PI3K/mTOR/Akt pathway alteration [ PIK3CA mutation, PTEN loss] KRAS, BRAF, 
HER2 or EGFR gene expression and/or mutation status).  In addition, information regarding 
the sample type for the initial diagnostic biopsy will be collected.
The required baseline laboratory tests include: blood hematology and chemistry, HbA1c, 
pregnancy test (serum or urine), and urinalysis.
Consent will be required for all patients enrolling in this study to access archived tumor 
biopsies to examine variation in proteins and genes associated with PI3K, HER-family receptor and MAPK signaling; examples include PTEN and PIK3CA , PIK3R1 , AKT, KRAS , 
and BRAF .  If an archived biopsy is not available, a fresh biopsy sample at baseline will be 
required.  Paired tumor biopsies are also required from patients treated in the MTD cohorts(see Section 7.3 ).
Following completion of the screening assessments and confirmation of eligibility, patients 
may be enrolled.
For screening procedures see Schedule of Activities and Section [ADDRESS_1267058] to comply with the protocol required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site.

reasonable efforts, in accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, to provide PF-05212384 and/or dacomitinib to patients deriving therapeutic benefit, for as long as appropriate drug supplies are available and, for patients treated in this study, until the treatment is authorized and commercially available for this use.  
7. ASSESSMENTS
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well being of the patient. When a protocol required test cannot be performed the Investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.
7.1. Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination, 
ECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory assessments including pregnancy tests.  In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be determined.
7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing
For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with 
sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study therapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within [ADDRESS_1267059], the patient will be withdrawn from study medication but may remain in the study.  
Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by [CONTACT_1744]/IECs or if required 
by [CONTACT_427].
7.1.2. Adverse Events
Assessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by [CONTACT_443059] [NCI CTCAE] version 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.

Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be 
used for all ECGs.  It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the standard intervals automatically. At each time point (see the Schedule of Activities ), three 
consecutive ECGs will be performed at approximately 2 minutes apart to determine the mean 
QTc interval.  If the mean QTc is prolonged ( ≥501 msec, ie, ≥CTC AE Grade 3), then the 090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Page 95ECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified person at the site for confirmation as soon as the 
finding is made, including verification that the machine reading is accurate. 
If manual reading verifies a QTc of ≥501 msec, immediate correction for reversible causes 
(including electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia and concomitant medications for drugs with the 
potential to prolong the QTc interval) should be performed.
In addition, repeat ECGs should be immediately performed hourly for at least 3 hours until 
the QTc interval falls below 501 msec. If QTc interval reverts to less than 501 msec, and in the judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsor is determined to be due to cause(s) other than study drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval >500 msec or an increase of >60 msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient will be discontinued from the study.  
Prior to concluding that an epi[INVESTIGATOR_4559], 
thorough consideration should be given to potential precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4582] (eg, change in patient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and possible evaluation by [CONTACT_4636].
If a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures, 
or stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.
When matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK 
draw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK sample is scheduled at [ADDRESS_1267063] prior to the 1 hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be collected at the nominal time). 
7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements (Arm C only)
Determination of LVEF by [CONTACT_903320], the 
end of Cycle 3, the end of Cycle 6, and then every 6 cycles for Arm C patients only.  The same technique should be used throughout for an individual patient. 
If an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by [CONTACT_341014], then the 
LVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if available); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the judgment of Investigator.  In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that patient may benefit from ongoing therapy.  Any clinically significant changes will be recorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of the Investigator.  
For any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular 
dysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4 month interval to assess for resolution is recommended.090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Blood samples (3 mL whole blood per sample collection timepoint) will be collected for PK 
analysis of PF-05212384, docetaxel, and dacomitinib (and the desmethyl metabolite PF-05199265) as outlined in the Schedule of Activities .  A blood sample of 6 mL of whole 
blood per sample collection timepoint, will be collected for the PK analysis of cisplatin as outlined in the Schedule of Activities .  Blood samples for PK assessment will be collected up 
through Cycle 6. PK sampling schedule may be modified based on emerging PK data.  
In addition to samples collected at the scheduled times, when feasible, an additional blood 
sample should be collected from patients experiencing unexpected and/or serious AEs which are suspected to be related to study drug treatment and the date and time documented in the CRF.
All efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the scheduled nominal time 
relative to dosing.  However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 minute sample) will be considered protocol compliant, and the exact time of the sample collection noted on the CRF.  If a scheduled blood sample collection cannot be completed for any reason, the missed sample time may be re-scheduled with agreement of clinical Investigators, patient, and Sponsor.
PK samples will be assayed for PF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib (and its 
metabolite PF-05199265) using validated analytical methods in compliance with [COMPANY_007] standard operating procedures.  Details regarding the collection, processing, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_903260].

.  
This study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling pathways that could be modified in vivo by [CONTACT_903321].  The biomarker studies will be used to help understand the in vivo mechanism of action of the agents, levels of pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing to the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.  
To meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre- and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched” 
fresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation and the MTD cohorts.  The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD cohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a discussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is made.  Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases deep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver metastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies obtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patients in the expansion portion of the study enrolling patients with TNBC.
Biopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the 
Schedule of Activities .  A formalin fixed paraffin block will be prepared and collected from 
each biopsy.  These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein biomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug sensitivity (eg, emerging KRAS mutation).  Additional markers may be included as 
pre-clinical studies or literature reports further elucidate the mechanisms of action of any of 
the study drugs.

Whole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle [ADDRESS_1267066]-dose, but no more than 72 hours later).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein markers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.
 
7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism
A PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose.  In the 
Phase 1 studies, administration of PF-05212384 resulted in increased levels of circulating glucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy.  These observations suggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based biomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers.  The current studies will therefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as pharmacodynamics markers for dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.
7.4. Tumor Response Assessments
Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites.  Imaging must include 
the chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order to monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-[ADDRESS_1267067] or MRI scan for patients with known or suspected brain metastases and bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with known or suspected bone metastases are required.
The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at 
baseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.
Anti-tumor activity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at 
baseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease 
progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if 
not done in the previous 6 weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of care within [ADDRESS_1267068] version 1.1 ( Appendix 2 ). &&,090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

The instruments will be given to the patient in the appropriate language for the site.
7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23
The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module ( Appendix 10 and
Appendix 11 , respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to 
clinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient reported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.
47Both self report measures are also 
widely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease symptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.
The EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix 10 ) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated 
into five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social domains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess additional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment.  The questionnaire employs 28 4-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point Likert scales for global health and overall QOL.
48For functional and global QOL scales, 
higher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a [ADDRESS_1267072] cancer-specific companion module to the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three symptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering sexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.
Both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-[ADDRESS_1267073](s) will be reported as described in the following sections. 
For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event (SAE) requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.  For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_357785].  The Investigator is required to assess causality.  090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

8.2. Reporting Period
For SAEs, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including [ADDRESS_1267075].  Serious adverse events occurring to a patientafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the Investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the Investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the Sponsor.
AEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has 
taken at least one dose of investigational product through the patient’s last visit.
•If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non-serious 
AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it occurs 
during the SAE reporting period after the last dose of investigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatment.
8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
•Abnormal test findings;
•Clinically significant symptoms and signs;
•Changes in physical examination findings;
•Hypersensitivity;
•Drug abuse;
•Drug dependency.
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

8.4. Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AE are as follows:
•Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or
•Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;
and/or
•Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or
•Test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_9304].
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.

Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the safety 
database (see Section 8.13.1 SAE Reporting Requirements).
8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury 
Liver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this 
study.  However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because of clinical sign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up 
as described below.
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered 
important medical events.  090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

who subsequently present with AST or ALT values ≥3 times the upper limit of 
normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value ≥[ADDRESS_1267076] with no evidence

The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history and physical assessment.  The possibility of hepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary) should be considered.  In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase,total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted.  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no other cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.

Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the patient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs listed above.
8.8. Causality Assessment
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the Investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if applicable.  An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the Investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by [CONTACT_1034] (see Section on Reporting Requirements ).  If 
the Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational product”, this should be clearly documented on study records.  
In addition, if the Investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the 
Investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Page 1098.9. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy (EDP) occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy.
If a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this information to the [COMPANY_007] Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form and Exposure in Utero (EIU) Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the Investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EIU Form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).
Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for
all EIU reports with an unknown outcome.  The Investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow up to the initial EIU Form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for the termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:

Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by [CONTACT_3786].  Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal exposure, the Investigator will provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner.
8.10. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_4693], which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study, the information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section Patient Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF page.  
When a patient withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by 
[CONTACT_4694].  In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.
8.13. Reporting Requirements
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If an SAE occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_1267081] be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE information.  This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports 090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.  
In the rare event that the Investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_1267082] awareness of the AE.
For all SAEs, the Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an Investigatormay be requested by [CONTACT_4695]-up information in an expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on the AE CRF.  In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications, vaccines and/or illnesses must be provided.  In the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative. 
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  It should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AEterm should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial

An interval for DLT rate, called equivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_12183].  Any DLT rate in the equivalence interval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD estimation.  In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%.  For each dose level, the uniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.  
Dose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.  
Specifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval, the interval below it, and the interval above it.  Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for each of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.  The mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_903263] a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the equivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current dose level; and it recommends a lower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current dose level.  To protect patients from highly toxic dose levels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if the posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate, provided that [ADDRESS_1267085] 5, then the criteria for recommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT rate at the current dose level: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be recommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the feasibility of the dose so recommended.  The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment is similar to an approach used by [CONTACT_903323].
34  The dose assignment 
recommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in Figure 7 . 
At the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.  
Specifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic 
estimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which the isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate.  If two or more dose levels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTD estimate will be the highest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the lowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate. 
Simulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described 
and summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

Page 1149.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C
For Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35  This is a 
3+3 design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding.  The rule of dose assignment is described in Section 3.1.1 . 
Table 17 shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying 
true DLT rates.  For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients, there is a greater than 90% probability of escalating.  Conversely, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose escalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6 patients experiencing DLTs.

If the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including 
those in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level, pending review of the data by [CONTACT_274180].

The expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D 
during the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus cisplatin in patients with TNBC.
Enrollment of patients to a specific arm may be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor 
activity in that arm is observed during the study.
9.3. Sample Size Determination
On April 1, 2015, [COMPANY_007] Inc. decided to stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002 
clinical trial.  Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to enter the study after notification of the decision.  Due to closure, the MTD of those combinations will not be established.  All references to objectives, endpoints, study design, assessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of patients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for Arm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C).  The decision is based on the company’s change in prioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory interactions.
There are [ADDRESS_1267087] to PF-05212384 only.  A total of

The TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30 response-evaluable patients, 
including 15 in Arm 1 and 2, respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete response (CR)+partial response (PR)). 
•For 1
stline patients (Arm 1):
•Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of 
anti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a 
60% response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9 out of 15 patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true response is not inferior to 45%.
•For 2
nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)
•Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of 
anti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a 
40% response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15 patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 91% that the true response is not inferior to 25%.
The total sample size for the study is approximately [ADDRESS_1267089] tumor assessment will be listed.
If the data permits, objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate will be provided 
by [CONTACT_903324].  Objective response includes CR and PR.  Clinical benefit 
response includes PR, CR and SD ( ≥[ADDRESS_1267090] dose to treatment failure).090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Page 1169.4.2. Efficacy Analysis for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC
In the expansion portion of the study, objective response is the primary endpoint.  Objective 
response rate, clinical benefit response rate, duration of response (DOR), and PFS will becalculated for expansion Arm 1 and 2.  Objective response includes CR and PR.  Clinical 
benefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD ( ≥[ADDRESS_1267091] dose to treatment 
failure).
DOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any 
cause. In the event of no progression or death, the last tumor assessment date without progression will be used in this calculation. 
PFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or 
death due to any cause.  Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.
The posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activity will be 
calculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.
Tumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not 
limited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.  In addition, dates of progression, death, first response, and last tumor assessment will be listed.
9.5. Analysis of Other Endpoints
9.5.1. Analysis of Single- and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics
Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters including the maximum plasma concentration (C
max), 
time to maximum plasma concentration (T max), and area under the plasma concentration 
versus time curve (AUC last, AUC τ) for PF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib
will be estimated using non-compartmental analysis.  If data permit or if considered appropriate, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC
inf), 
terminal elimination half-life (t ½), plasma clearance (CL), apparent volume of distribution Vd, 
accumulation ratio (R ac) and linearity ratio (R ss) will also be estimated. The single dose and 
steady-state PK parameters will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_2715], cycle and day.
For PF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib concentrations will be summarized 
descriptively (n, mean, SD, percent coefficient of variation (CV), median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) by [CONTACT_2715], cycle, day and nominal time.  Individual patient and median profiles of the concentration-time data will be plotted by [CONTACT_2715], cycle and day (single dose and steady-state) using nominal times.  Median profiles will be presented on both linear-linear and log-linear scales.
The observed accumulation ratio and the linearity ratio will be summarized descriptively.  
Each will be analyzed after natural log transformation using a one-way analysis of variance with a single term for dose.  The means and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained from the model will be back-transformed to provide means and 90% CIs for the accumulation and linearity ratios for each dose.090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Plasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the 
clinical study report (CSR).
9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers
For biopsy samples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV, 
and minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical biomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm.  For each pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baseline of these same parameters will also be calculated.
Data from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive 
statistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA).  The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with pharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumor efficacy.  Graphics may be provided as appropriate.
9.6. Safety Analysis
Summaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis 
set.
9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the 
study.  The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD as described in Section 3.3 .  The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by [CONTACT_903326].  Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be listed per dose level by [INVESTIGATOR_216].  
9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events
Adverse Events (AEs) will be graded by [CONTACT_903327] (CTCAE) version # 4.03 and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries, which will be by [INVESTIGATOR_216], will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication.  The number and 
percentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE, 
and treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades.  The summaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by [CONTACT_5265] (Lead-in, Cycle 1 and Cycles beyond 1). 090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

For laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal, 
abnormal or not done. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Electrocardiogram Assessments
The analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both 
baseline and on-treatment ECG data.  ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate measurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations.  Any data obtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be averaged with the preceding triplicates.  Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be included in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at 
unscheduled time points.
QT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie, 
Fredericia’s and possibly other factors).  The adequacy of the correction method may be assessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations may be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,QRS, and QTcF by [INVESTIGATOR_216], dose, and time.  The most appropriate correction factor will be selected and used for the following analyses of central tendency and outliers and used for the study conclusions.  Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) will be used to summarize the baseline QTc values and changes from baseline in QTc by [INVESTIGATOR_216], dose, and time point. For each patient and by [INVESTIGATOR_216], the maximum change from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across time-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change 
from baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.  
Shift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum 
CTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs baseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval changes from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses 
may be performed.  Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with 
PK/PD models.
9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes
The number and percentage of patients who complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 
will be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.
The mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95% CI) will be 
calculated. Repeated measures mixed model analyses will also be conducted to estimate changes in scores over time.

In addition to the above analyses, an examination of the time to deterioration (TTD) for 
global QOL will be carried out using survival analysis methods.
9.8. Data Safety Monitoring Committee
An external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the 
purpose of this protocol, [COMPANY_007] procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by [CONTACT_134998]. This will include surveillance 
for SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.
Discussions between the Investigators and the Sponsor regarding AEs and laboratory test 
abnormalities seen at each dose level will occur in an on-going manner at regular teleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and 
determine if further patient enrollment is appropriate.
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During study conduct, [COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The Investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.
The study site may be subject to review by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB)/IEC, and/or 
to quality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_4618], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708].
It is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.

The CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_903328]. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the 
original entry.
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the physician’s patient chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the Investigator
agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be retained by [CONTACT_903329] (ICH), local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.
If the Investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another Investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by [CONTACT_4618].

CATEGORIZING LESIONS AT BASELINE
Measurable Lesions
Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension.
•Lesions with longest diameter twice the slice thickness and at least [ADDRESS_1267110] or MRI (slice thickness 5-8 mm).
•Lesions with longest diameter at least [ADDRESS_1267111] X-ray.  
•Superficial lesions with longest diameter 10 mm or greater when assessed by [CONTACT_4733].
•Malignant lymph nodes with the short axis [ADDRESS_1267112].
NOTE: The shortest axis is used as the diameter for malignant lymph nodes, longest 
axis for all other measurable lesions. 
Non-measurable disease
Non-measurable disease includes lesions too small to be considered measurable (including 
nodes with short axis between 10 and 14.9 mm) and truly non-measurable disease such aspleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, leptomeningeal disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, clinical lesions that cannot be accurately measured with calipers, abdominal masses identified by [CONTACT_297019].
•Bone disease: Bone disease is non-measurable with the exception of soft tissue 
components that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_4735].  
•Previous local treatment: A previously irradiated lesion (or lesion patiented to other 
local treatment) is non-measurable unless it has progressed since completion of treatment.
Normal sites
•Cystic lesions : Simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions and should 
not be recorded either as target or non-target disease.  Cystic lesions thought to 
represent cystic metastases can be measurable lesions, if they meet the specific definition above.  If non-cystic lesions are also present, these are preferred as target lesions.090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Target lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability for accurate repeated measurements.  Record the longest diameter for each lesion, except in the case of pathological lymph nodes for which the short axis should be recorded.  The sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions at baseline will be the basis for comparison to assessments performed on study. 
•If two target lesions coalesce the measurement of the coalesced mass is used.  If a 
large target lesion splits, the sum of the parts is used.
•Measurements for target lesions that become small should continue to be recorded.  If 
a target lesion becomes too small to measure, [ADDRESS_1267114] disappeared; otherwise a default value of 5 mm should be recorded.
NOTE: When nodal lesions decrease to <10 mm (normal), the actual measurement 
should still be recorded.
Non-target disease 
All non-measurable disease is non-target.  All measurable lesions not identified as target 
lesions are also included as non-target disease.  Measurements are not required but rather assessments will be expressed as ABSENT, INDETERMINATE, PRESENT/NOT INCREASED, INCREASED.  Multiple non-target lesions in one organ may be recorded as a single item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
OBJECTIVE RESPONSE STATUS AT EACH EVALUATION.
Disease sites must be assessed using the same technique as baseline, including consistent 
administration of contrast and timing of scanning.  If a change needs to be made the case must be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution is possible.  If not, subsequent objective statuses are indeterminate.  090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Page 136Target disease
•Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all target lesions with the 
exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis <10 mm).  All target lesions must be assessed.
•Partial Response (PR): Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the 
sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions.  The short diameter is used in the 
sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is used in the sum for all other target lesions.  All target lesions must be assessed.  
•Stable: Does not qualify for CR, PR or Progression.  All target lesions must be 
assessed.  Stable can follow PR only in the rare case that the sum increases by [CONTACT_4736] 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously documented 30% decrease no longer holds.  
•Objective Progression (PD): 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in 
the sum is observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm.  
•Indeterminate. Progression has not been documented, and 
•one or more target measurable lesions have not been assessed.
•or assessment methods used were inconsistent with those used at baseline.
•or one or more target lesions cannot be measured accurately (eg, poorly 
visible unless due to being too small to measure).
•or one or more target lesions were excised or irradiated and have not 
reappeared or increased.  
Non-target disease
•CR: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
levels. All lymph nodes must be ‘normal’ in size (<10 mm short axis).
•Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of any non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level 
above the normal limits. 
•PD: Unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions.  Generally the overall tumor 
burden must increase sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  In the presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, progression due to unequivocal increase in non-target disease should be rare.  090177e195f25b0e\A pproved\A pproved On: 06-Jan-2021 09:45 (GMT )

Page 137•Indeterminate: Progression has not been determined and one or more non-target sites 
were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at 
baseline.
New Lesions 
The appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion indicates PD.  If a new lesion is 
equivocal, for example due to its small size, continued assessment will clarify the etiology.  If repeat assessments confirm the lesion, then progression should be recorded on the date of the initial assessment.  A lesion identified in an area not previously scanned will be considered a new lesion.
Supplemental Investigations
•If CR determination depends on a residual lesion that decreased in size but did not 
disappear completely, it is recommended the residual lesion be investigated with 
biopsy or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  If no disease is identified, objective status is CR.
•If progression determination depends on a lesion with an increase possibly due to
necrosis, the lesion may be investigated with biopsy or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_313542]. 
Subjective progression
Patients requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression should not be reported as PD on tumor assessment CRFs.  This should be indicated on the end of treatment CRF as off treatment due to Global Deterioration of Health Status.  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

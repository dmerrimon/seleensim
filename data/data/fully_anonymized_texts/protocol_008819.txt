Title: Impact of COVID -19 on Marshallese Communities in the U.S.  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_747257] #: 3 IRB# 261131  
Date: 20200915  Page 2  Background and Rationale  
While there is much we do not know about the differential effects of COVID -19, early data 
shows that minority communities are disproportionally effected by [CONTACT_84096].1-4 There are many 
factors that may increase the likelihood of contracting COVID -19 including: 1) community 
spread because of lack of access to testing in low -income communities, 2) wor k environments 
that may increase exposure, 3) more densely populated housing that reduces the ability to social 
distance, 4) limited understanding of preventive measures due to literacy and language barriers, 
5) constrained financial resources to stay home  and not work, and/or 6) lack of trust in the health 
care system.  The Marshallese are a Pacific Islander population experiencing significant health 
disparities with some of the highest documented rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  of any 
population in the world.5-7 Estimated type 2 diabetes rates among Marshallese in the United 
States range from  25% -50%, 400% higher than the general US population.5,8 People with 
diabetes are more likely  to experience severe symptoms and complications when infected with 
COVID -19; however, those that manage their diabetes well are less li kely to become extremely 
ill fro m the virus .[ADDRESS_1022374] effected by [CONTACT_4113] -19, it is critical to understand minority populations’: 1) 
risk exp osure, 2) knowledge of preventive recommendations, 3) barr iers and facilitators to 
implementing preventative recommendations, 4) barriers and facilitators to COVID -19 testing 
when appropriate , and  self-care behaviors during COVID -19. 
 
Specific Aims  
Aim 1:  Document COVID -19 risk exp osure  for Marshallese community members.  
Aim 2:  Document Marshallese community members’ knowledge of preventive 
recommendations.  
Aim 3:  Document barriers and facilitators to implementing preventative recommendations . 
Aim 4 : Document Marshallese community members’ barriers and facilitators to COVID -19 
testing  when appropriate.  
Aim 5:  Document self -care behaviors during COVID -19. 
Aim 6:  Explore COVID -19 pandemic related barriers and facilitators to diabetes self -
management among Marshallese adults with T2DM.  
Aim 7 : Assess the effect of the COVID -19 pandemic on diabetes self -management activities 
among Marshallese adults with T2DM. 
 
Study Design  and Procedures  
Up to 2000 Marshallese will complete an online  or telephone survey. Up to 100 participants will 
be invited to complete a n in-depth qualitative interview.  
The study will be advertised by [CONTACT_747262] . The flyer wi ll 
contain a link to the study information sheet  and survey documents. S tudy team members will 
also reach out to study participants via phone or electronic mediums (e.g. email, text, or 
messenger). S tudy staff will send potential participants a link to an electronic survey using 
REDcap.10 The REDcap system will include electronic documentation of consent prior to 
completing the survey. Participants electing to access the survey through a telephone int erview 
rather than the online process will be read the study information sheet before the survey 
instrument is completed. For those randomly selected to complete an in- depth qualitative 
interview, study team members will recruit them via phone or electronic mediums (e.g. email, 
text, or messenger) and schedule the interview by [CONTACT_747263]: Impact of COVID -19 on Marshallese Communities in the U.S.

Study Population  
We will recruit up to 2000 Marshallese participants for the study. As part of UAMS IRB study 
#207034, the study team has recruited [ADDRESS_1022375] consented to be contact[CONTACT_7678]. Additional Marshallese participants will be 
recruited through our engagement network if needed to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_747258]. 
Community based recruitment will be achieved by [CONTACT_102219] t he survey information on websites 
and Facebook.  
Participant inclusion criteria : 
1) Self-reported Marshallese 
2) 18 years of age or older  
3) Live in the Continental  U.S. or Hawaii  
 
Measures/outcomes  
Using a mixed -methods concurrent triangulation design,12-[ADDRESS_1022376] the study at any time.  
 
Remuneration:  Each participant who completes the survey will receive a $[ADDRESS_1022377] 
for remuneration and each person who completes the qualitative interview will receive an 
additional $[ADDRESS_1022378] received 
training on: pa rticipant consent proc edures, the study protocol, human subject s protection, 
HIPAA regulations, survey administration, maintaining confidentiality of study participants, 
mandatory reporting, and appropriate treatment of participant data. Access to study data will be 
limited to only those personnel who need it to complete relevant job duties. All da ta, regardless 
of whether it is identifiable or not, will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a locked room, or on 
a secure UAMS server that requires two -factor authentication. 
 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others  
There will be no direct benefits to the study participants; however, knowledge gained from the 
study could potentially benefit patients in the future.

Date: [ADDRESS_1022379] completed all required trainings for study activities and in maintaining confidentiality. 
Participant identification numbers will be used to track study forms. All records will be retained 
consistent with the U AMS Administrative Guide (seven years after final reporting or publication 
of a project).  
 
Data Analysis  
In a mixed -method concurrent triangulation design, study data is analyzed separately and then 
combined during the interpretation phase.12-[ADDRESS_1022380] differences in risk exp osure, knowledge, barriers and 
facilitators from one another (e.g., comparisons between respondents with different education 
and/or income levels, English proficiency, job sectors). For inferential analyses, alpha will be set 
at .[ADDRESS_1022381] size indicators will be included. 
 
For each descriptive and inferential analysis, each respondent's data will be included if she or he 
responded to the relevant items, regardless of the amount of missing data for that respondent on 
other items. However, there will be no attempt to impute missing responses for any items. For 
each analysis, the number of included responses will be reported.  
 
Researchers with qualitative research experience will code the text of the open -ended questions 
for emergent  themes. In order to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_747259] -ended responses, a 
coding template is the most appropriate and effective strategy to analyze the text.22,[ADDRESS_1022382] domain by [CONTACT_747264]: Impact of COVID -19 on Marshallese Communities in the U.S.

Study team members will share the recruitment flyer on social media and also reach out to 
potential participants via phone or electronic mediums. Those potential participants who express 
interest in taking part in the study will be sent a link to an electronic survey using REDcap.10 The 
REDcap system will include written information about the study  prior to completing the survey. 
Participants electing to access the survey through a telephone interview rather than the online 
process will be read the study information sheet before the survey instrument is completed. For 
those randomly selected to complete an in -depth interview, study  team members will recruit 
them via phone or electronic mediums (e.g. email, text, or messenger). Prior to collecting 
qualitative data, the study information sheet will be provided again prior to data collection.  
 
This is a minimal risk study and a waiver of documentation of consent is requested. The research 
involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects and the research involves no procedures for 
which written consent is normally required outside of the research context.  
 
Dissemination of Data 
Results  of this study may be used for presentations, posters, or publications. The publications 
will not contain any identifiable information that could be linked to a participant. The study will 
be listed on clinicaltrials.gov in accordance with ( funder and/or journal) requirements. 
Aggregated results may be returned to participants in an infographic that is provided by  e-mail to 
the participants  if we have their email address . We will also work with stakeholders to 
disseminated aggregated information in town ha ll meetings.

Active Ingredient (s):
Test Naproxen Sodium, 220 mg Tablet (440 mg dose as two 220 mg tablets) (Test NPX)
Title of Study: 
A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo- and Active -Controlled, Efficacy and Safety Study of a 
Test Naproxen Sodium 220 mg Tablet in Postoperative Dental Pain
Country: [LOCATION_003]
Phase of development: 3
Objective:
To evaluate analgesic onset, efficacy, and safety of a single dose of [ADDRESS_823318] Naproxen Sodium 220 mg tablets (Test NPX) compared with two 
commercial naproxen sodium products (two 220 mg tablets and two  220 mg 
 capsule s) and placebo in the dental pain model following third -molar extractions.
Methodology:
This will be a single -dose, randomized, double- blind, placebo- and active -controlled, parallel -
group study to evaluate the analgesic onset, efficacy, and safety profi le of [ADDRESS_823319] 
not result in a trauma rating of severe on a mild, moderate, or severe scale:
•two full bony impactions
• two partial bony impactions
•one full bony impaction in combination with one partial bony impaction
Pain assessments will be based on subject self -report.  Subjects who meet the randomization 
criteria (post -surgical pain of moderate to severe on the four-poi nt categorical pain scale [0-no 
pain, 1 -mild pain , 2-moderate pain, 3- severe pain] , and at least a score of 5 on the 11- point [0-10]

•Time to confirmed perceptible pain relief (TCPR)
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint
•Percentage of subjects with confirmed perceptible pain relief from 45 minutes to successively
earlier minutes in one -minute increments (Test NPX versus PBO)
 
 
Safety:
Safety will be monitored and assessed by [CONTACT_363825], evaluation, and analysis of 
AEs. Any causally related AE that is unreso
lved upon completion of the last study visit will be 
followed by [CONTACT_619457], or its sequelae, resolves or stabilizes at a level 
acceptable to the Investigator.
Statistical methods:
 
. The survival 
function (cumulative proportions of subjects with pain relief at each time point) and the median 
survival time will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method for each treatment. The survival 
functions will be compared using the Wilcoxon test. 
The earliest time of separation of confirmed perceptible pain relief between T est NPX and 
placebo will be established by [CONTACT_619458] 45 minutes to successively earlier minutes in one -minute increments, 
until statistical significance is no longer achieved. The dichotomized response will be analyzed 
using logistic regression analysis.

16of 616. INTRODUCTION
Naproxen is a propi[INVESTIGATOR_619447]- inflammatory  drug (NSAID) 
with analges ic and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of naprox en involves 
inhibition of cy cloox ygenase enzymes resulting in decr eased prostaglandin sy nthesis. 
The 
sodium salt of naproxen has been developed as a more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y absorbed formulation of 
naproxen.  Naproxen sodium products have been available over -the-count er (OTC) for the 
indications of fever reduction and relief of minor aches and pains in several countries for 
many  years. 
In the [LOCATION_002], naproxen sodium has been available as an OTC analgesic and 
antipy retic since 1994. It is indicated for OTC use f or the temporary  relief of minor aches 
and pains due to: minor pain of arthritis, muscular aches, backache, menstrual cramps, 
headache, toothache, and the common cold, and for temporary  reduction of fever.   According 
to the Drug Facts for  , dosing for adults and children 12 years of age and older 
is one 220 mg dosage unit (e.g., tablet, caplet, capsule) every  8-[ADDRESS_823346] not yet been conducted on the  formulation 
of naproxen sodium. The current stud y will evaluate the analgesic onset, e fficacy  and safet y 
of a single 4 40 mg dose of  naproxen sodium (administered as two 
220 m g tablets) compared to two currentl y marketed  formulations of naproxen 
sodium and placebo after third molar dental extractions. The postoperative dental pain model 
is a validated model of acute pain that is widel y used to study  analgesic efficacy  of
compounds [1][2].

molars may be removed regardless of impaction level.  The mandibular extractions must 
meet one of t he following scenarios and must not result in a trauma rating of severe in a mild, 
moderate, or severe scale:
two full bony impactions
two partial bony impactions
one full bony impaction in combination with one partial bony impaction
Pain assessments will be based on subject self -
report.  Subjects who meet the randomization 
criteria (post -surgical pain of moderate to severe on the four -point categorical pain scale [0 -
no pain, 1- mild pain,2 -moderate pain, 3 -severe pain], and at least a score of 5 on the 11 -point 
[0-10] pain intensity  numerical rating scale [PI -NRS] at baseline within 4.[ADDRESS_823349]

will be within [ADDRESS_823350] NPX,  
tablets, capsules, or placebo in a 3:3:3:1 allocation rati o, and will be 
stratified according to gender and baseline pai n rating (moderate or severe). 
To maintain the 
double -blind nature of the study , an independent third part y will administer study drug to 
blindfolded subjects. No less than approximately 30% of randomized subjec ts will be either 
male or female. In addition, no more than approximately  30% of subjects will be 17 y ears of 
age at the time of screening. 
Pain intensity  (PI-NRS)  (using the 11- point [0 -10] pain relief numerical rating 
scale [PR -NRS]) wil l be collected at eepost dose as well as at the time of rescue (if 
applicable) before administration . 
Perceptible pain relief and meaningful pain relief will be collected using two separate 
stopwatches. S ubjects who do not experience pain relief after dosing will be encouraged but 
not required to wait at least 1.[ADDRESS_823351] Naproxen Sodium 220 mg Tablet

28of 61•The Sponsor will provide a randomization schedule directl y to the qualified third -party 
individual. The randomization schedu le will be kept in a locked, secured area with access 
limited to only  the assigned third- party individual and un -blinded monitor. 
•Covered dosing cups will be used b y the assigned third- party dispenser to transport the 
assigned investigational product fr om the designated dispensing room to the subject’s room.
Investigational product preparation and dispensing will be performed on Day  1, following 
dental surgery . For subjects who meet the randomization criteria, an independent third -party 
dispenser will ad minister one of the following study  treatments with up to 180 ml of water at 
ambient temperature to blindfolded subjects:
a single [ADDRESS_823364] NPX 220 mg tablets
a single 440 -mg dose of naproxen sodium as two commercial 220 mg tablets
a single 440 -mg dose of naproxen sodium as two commercial  220 
mg capsules, or
a single dose of two placebo tablets
Baseline pain assessments and drug administration will be completed in the subject’s room. 
The third- party dispenser will prepare study  medication for each subject in a designated 
dispensing room. Study  medication will be dispensed at the time that the subject’s pain level 
is determined to be eligible by [CONTACT_453363], just prior to the completion of the ba seline 
categorical pain severity  scale and the baseline 11- point [0 -10] pain intensity  numerical 
rating scale [PI -NRS]. The study  coordinator will communicate the subject’s pain severit y 
and gender to the dispenser. The dispenser will assign the next avail able randomization 
number from the appropriate stratum. The dispenser will dispense the appropriate study  
treatment from the appropriate bulk supply containers into an individual dosing cup. The 
double -blind label with the same randomization number will be affixed to the dosing cup and 
the tear -off portion of the label will be attached to the patient’s source documents. The third -
party  dispenser will complete the study drug dispensing record. The study  drug dispensing 
record will remain in a secure and lock ed area, with access limited to the unblinded third -
party  dispenser, back- up staff member, and un- blinded monitor. A second individual, with no 
other study  involvement, will witness the preparation and dispensing process. No other study  
personnel will be p resent in the designated dispensing room at the time of study  drug 
dispensing. The dispenser will ensure the dosing cup containing the randomized study  
treatment is covered prior to exiting the dispensing room. 
The third- party dispenser will inform the blinded study  coordinator once the study  drug is 
dispensed and is read y to be administered to the subject. Following completion of the 
baseline categorical pain severit y scale and baseline pain intensity numerical rating scale, the 
study  coordinator will bli ndfold the subject and then exit the subject’s room to inform the 
dispenser that the pain assessments are completed and confirm that the pain severit y has not 
changed from the verbal assessment used to determine the appropriate randomization, and

cup to ensure no other individual will be able to see the stud y drug in the bottle. No other 
study  personnel, other than the third -party witness, will be present in the subject’s room at 
the time of dosing.
After entering the blindfolded subject’s room and while the subject is sitting up, the 
dispenser will hand the dosing cu p containing the study  treatment to the blindfolded subject 
and instruct the subject to empty  the contents of the dosing cup directl y into their mouth and 
then swallow the study  medication immediately  with up to [ADDRESS_823366]’s oral cavit y to ensure that the study  
treatment was swallowed. The time at which the subject swallows the study medication will 
be recorded as Time 0. Study  drug will be administered to the subject within [ADDRESS_823367] is stored in a secured area, at room temperature, 68 ºF to 77 ºF (20 ºC 
to 25 ºC) and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
The investigator, or assigned representative, must maintain adequate records documenting 
the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition of the investigational product on the Investigat ional

The randomization schedule will be generated b y the Sponsor to ensure treatment blinding. 
The site will keep the rando mization schedule in a locked, secured area with access limited to 
only the assigned third -party  person(nel), back- up staff member, and un- blinded monitor. 
After meeting the appropriate post -surgery  criteria, subjects will be randomized to receive 
one of f our treatments (Test NPX 440 mg,  tablet 440 mg,  440 mg 
orplacebo) in a 3:3:3:1 ratio. Subjects will be stratified by  [CONTACT_363840] 
(moderate or severe). For subjects with moderate baseline pain, randomization numbers wil l 
be assigned to subjects in sequential order starting with the lowest available number within 
the appropriate gender stratum. Similarly , for subjects with severe baseline pain intensity , 
subjects will be assigned in sequential order starting with the high est available number in the 
appropriate gender stratum.
10.6. Blinding and Unblinding 
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], it is necessary to break the treatment code for safet y 
reasons and circumstances allow, the Investigator will first contact [CONTACT_619468] y blind. If there is a 
medical emergency and the Investigator deems it necessary  to know the subject’s study  
treatment urgentl y for the subject’s proper medical care, the Inve stigator may  break the 
treatment code immediately , and then contact [CONTACT_363839].
In the event of a medical emergency that necessitates breaking the code, the third -party 
person(nel) will be permitted to inform the I nvestigator what study  drug the subject was 
given.
When the blind is broken, the I nvestigator will notify  the Sponsor within 24 hours after 
determining that it is necessary  to unblind the treatment assignment and document the r eason 
and date of the unblinding. The event will also be recorded in the CRF and in the source 
document. An y AE or (Serious Adverse Event) SAE associated with breaking the blind must 
be recorded and reported as specified in this protocol.
Once the treatmen t is unblinded, the subject must be discontinued from the study  and 
followed until the event is resolved. The rationale, date, time, and attempts to contact [CONTACT_453368]. The study site should take the

11.4. Randomization
After the dental procedure, subj ects will be asked to rest quietly  at the study center until they  
experience both post -surgical pain of at least moderate pain on a categorical scale ranging 
from (0) none to (3) severe and at least a score of 5 on the 11- point (0 -10) PI -NRS within 4.[ADDRESS_823372]’s oral cavity  to ensure that the investigational product was swallowed.
11.5. Post dose Assessments
Two stopwatches labeled as perceptible and as meaningful will be used to measure 
“perceptible pain relief” and “meaningful pain relief”, respectivel y. The face of each 
stopwatch will be covered to prevent the subject from seeing the running clock. Upon dosing, 
the investigator or the designated site staff will start both stopwatches at the same time. 
Subjects will only  be given the second stopwatch af ter they  stop the first one.
Site personnel will instruct “I would like you to stop the first stopwatch (perceptible) when 
you first begin to feel any  pain relieving effect whatsoever of the drug, that is, when y ou first 
feel an y pain relief. This does not necessarily  mean y ou feel completel y better, although you 
might, but when you first feel an y difference in the pain you have now. As soon as you stop 
the stopwatch please press y our call light to notify  the study  coordinator. I would like y ou to 
stop the 
second stopwatch (meaningful) when you have meaningful pain relief, that is, when 
the relief from the starting pain is meaningful to you. As soon as y ou stop the stopwatch, 
please press y our call light to notify  the study  coordinator.” Upon dosing, the investigator or 
the designated site staff will start both stopwatches at the same time. Once the stopwatch has

following sections.  For all AEs, the I nvestigator or medicall y qualified individual 
(MD/DO/DMD/DDS) must pursue and obtain adequate information to make the appropriate 
assessments.  
13.1. Definition s
13.1.1. Definition of Adverse Event 
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a subject after they have signed an 
informed consent for a study . The event does not need to have a suspected causal relationship 
with the IP. Therefore, an AE can be an y unfavorable and unintended si gn, sy mptom, disease 
or injury  temporally  associated with the subject’s participation inthe 
study .Examples of AE s 
include, but are not limited to:
Abnormal test findings, 
Clinically  important signs and symptoms,
Changes in ph ysical examination findings,
Hypersensitivity , and 
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease. 
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Overdose, 
Withdrawal, 
Abuse, 
Drug misuse, 
Drug interactions,
Medication errors, 
Product dependency ,
Exposure in utero, and
Study  related procedure

Version 2: 19 July 2018 - Administrative Change/Non -substantial Amendment [ADDRESS_823377] finding should be reported as
an AEare as follows:
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms, and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention
beyond ordering a repeat (confirmatory ) test ,and/or
Test result leads to a discontinuation from the study, significant additional 
concomitant treatment, or other therap y, and/or
Test result is considered to be an AEby [CONTACT_619471].
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an e rror does not require 
reporting as an AE.
13.1.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE) forDrugs
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” for a drug study  if, in the view 
of either the medically  qualified investigator or designee (MD/DO/DMD/DDS) or the 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
Results in death,
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death),
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],
Results in persistent or signific ant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability  toconduct normal life functions,
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect,
Is considered medicall y significant (medical and scientific judgment should be
exercised in deciding whether expedited r eporting is appropriate in other 
situations, such as important medical events that may not result in death, be 
life-threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619451] a serious adverse 
drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment , they  may  
jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed above). Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an Emergency  
Room or at home, blood dy scrasia, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse, or 
malignancy ), or,

(medicall ysignificant) and should be reported as an SAE in the category  ‘Other 
medically  important condition s.’
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” for a device study  if, in the view 
of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, it results in any  of the following outcomes: 
Death
Serious injury which means an injury  or illness that:
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death), 
Results in permanent impairment of a bod y function or permanent damage to 
a body  structure, or 
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],
Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent 
impairment of a bod y function or permanent damage to a bod y structure; 
permanent means irreversible impairment or damage to a bod y structure or 
function, excluding trivial impairment or damage.
Results in congenital anom aly/birth defect
Persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability  to 
conduct normal life functions 
A malfunction that the device (or similar device marketed b y the same 
manufacturer or importer) would be likely  to cause death or similar injury  if the 
malfunction were to recur
Any suspected transmission of any  infectious agent via a medicinal product

(e.g., for work -up of persistent pre -treatment lab abnormality ), 
Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep), 
Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam), 
Protocol -specified admission during a clinical study  (e.g., for a procedure 
required b y the stud y protocol), 
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (e.g., or 
elective cosmetic surgery), 
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline documentation 
for the ent ire protocol and/or for the individual subject. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , 
should not be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the 
procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. 
For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period 
should be reported as the 
AEand the resulting append ectom y should be recorded 
as treatment of the AE.
13.2. Adverse Event Assessments 
Sufficient information should be obtained for each AE to allow the Investigator or medically 
qualified individual to make assessments as described below.
13.2.1. Severity Assessment
The severit y of AEs will be assessed b y the medically  qualified Investigator or designee 
using the following general categorical descriptors:
MILD: Awareness of s ymptoms that are easily  tolerated, causing minimal
discomfort and not interfering with the su bject's usual function or normal
every day activities.

Test Naproxen Sodium 220 mg Tablet

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL
42of 61MODERATE: Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference to some extent with
the subject's usual function or normal every day activity .
SEVERE : Extreme distress, causing significant impairment o f functioning or
incapacitation; interferes significantly with subject's usual function; 
prevents normal every day activities .
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not 
necessarily  a serious event. For e xample, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantl y 
with the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of 
the criteria for SAE s listed above.
13.2.2. Causality Assessment
Themedicall y qualified Investigator ’sassessment of causalit y to IP(i.e.,relationship to IP) 
must be provided for all AEs (serious and non -serious). Thecausality assessment is the 
determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility  that the IPcaused or 
contributed to an AE.
 Not Related -An AEthat is not related to the use of the drug
 Doubtful - An AEfor which an alternative explanation is more likely , e.g.,
concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests 
that a causal relationship to IPis unlikely .
 Possible - An AEthat might be due to the use of the drug .An alternative
explanation, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive.
Therelationship in time is reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship to IP
cannot be excluded.
 Probable 
-An AEthat might be due to the use of the drug.The relationship in 
time is suggestive (e.g., confirmed b y dechallenge) and an alternative 
explanation is less likely , e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).
 Very  Likely -An AEthat is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be 
reasonabl y explained by  [CONTACT_4867], e.g., concomitant drug(s),
concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very  suggestive (e.g., it is
confirmed b y dechallenge and r echallenge) for a causal relationship to the drug.
Any AE that occurs after the informed consent has been signed, until first usage of 
investigational product, will be considered non -treatment emergent and cannot (by  [CONTACT_619472]) have a c ausal relationship with the I P.
If the Investigator determines a nAEis associated with study  procedures, the Investigator 
must record this suspected causal relationship in the source documents and the SAE form ,as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.

43of 6113.2.3. Resolution
The medicall y qualified Investigator or designee will be required to assess the outcome of the 
AE for IPas one of the following: 
Resolved, 
Not Resolved,
Fatal,
Resolved with sequelae, 
Resolving, or
Unknown.
Any causall y-related AEs that are not resolved upon completion of the last study visit will be 
followed up b y the study staff until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabili zedat a level 
acceptable to the medically  qualified Investigator or designee , and recorded on the CRF.  An 
event that is assessed as resolved with sequelae or resolving indicates that the subject has 
stabilized to a level acceptable to the medicall y quali fied Investigator or designee and has 
concurrence b y the Sponsor. 
13.3. Adverse Event Reporting 
13.3.1. Time Period
All AEs , whether serious or non -serious, will be collect ed starting from the time a subject 
signs and dates an informed consent until the 
completion of the subject’s last study -related
procedure, which may  include contact [CONTACT_20687] -up of safet y. Spontaneous reports of serious 
AEs will be collected through and including [ADDRESS_823378]’s last dose of I P.
Any SAE occurring any  time after the reporting period must be promptly  reported if a causal 
relationship to study  product is suspected.  
13.3.2.
Process for Reporting
The Investigator is to report all AEs whether directly  observed or spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  subject.  In addition, each study  subject will be questioned in general about an y 
AEs.
All AEs, serious or non-serious, will be recorded on the source documents; e.g., written 
documentation, electronic medical records, subject diaries or journals .AEs will be entered 
into CRFs for screen failure subjects as well as randomized subjects. AEs should be reported 
using concise medical terminology  on the CRFs. Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it 
meets the criteria for an SAE. If an SAE occurs, expedited reporting is required.

immediately  upon awareness of the event by  [CONTACT_737]’s site and the SAE documented 
on the source document .Within 24 hours of the I nvestigator site’s awareness of the event, 
the study  site must send the Sponsor the Clinical SAE Report Form (via a secure e -mail or 
fax). This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previousl y 
reported SAEs as well as to the initial and fol low-up reporting of Exposure I n Utero ( EIU)
cases. In the rare event that the Investigator’s site does not become aware of the occurrence 
of an SAE immediatel y (e.g., in a telephone contact, in a subject diary  or journal, or if an 
outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator’s site is to 
report the event immediately  after learning of it as described, and document the date and time 
of the study  site’s first a wareness of the AE in the subject’s file. 
For all SAEs, the Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the Sponsor 
in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_619473] -up inform ation in an 
expedited fashion. This information may  be more detailed tha n that captured on the AE CRF. 
In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a 
complete me dical assessment of the case and independent determ ination of possible 
causality . Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications 
and illnesses must be provided. I n the case of a subject death, a summary  of available 
autopsy  findings (if available) and death certificate should be collected if permission is 
obtai ned from the subject’s family . For a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a copy  of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619453]. If obtained, these documents (with subject’s personal 
identifiers redacted) should be submitted as soon as possible to the Sponsor or its designated 
representative. 
Appropriate SAE forms will be provided to the study  site at the initiation of the study .

45of 6113.4. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction
If the Sponsor judges an SAE to be a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R), the Sponsor will report it to the Regulatory  Authority (ies) and the Investigator (or 
Sponsor) must report to the IRB/IEC as required and in accordance with the Sponsor’s 
standard operating procedures for safet y reporting.
13.5. Special Situations
Special Situations are safety  events that may  not meet the definition of an AE; however, from 
a policy  perspective, they are treated in the same manner as AE and recorded in the s ource 
document and C RF.  Examples include:
Pregnancy  exposure (maternal and paternal) to a J&J product , see next section;
Off-label use of a J&J product.  Note: Off - label use of a product without an 
associated AE should be collected only when it is specifi cally and voluntarily 
brought to the attention of the company in an unsolicited manner by a reporter 
(e.g., Patient or HCP), or data obtained from databases where off -label use may 
be systematically collected (e.g., reimbursement database in US), and in 
accordance with local procedure in compliance with local laws and regulations.
Overdose of a J&J product ;
Exposure to a J&J product from breastfeeding;
Suspecte d abuse/misuse of a J&J product;
Inadvertent ,accidental exposure , or occupational exposure to a J &J product;
For marketed products, a ny failure of expected pharmacological /therapeutic
action (i.e. , lack of effect) of a J&J product.   Lack of effect/Lack of efficacy 
defined as any failure that a product did not achieve expected pharmacological 
action/th erapeutic benefit when used in accordance with the Reference Safety  
Information or equivalent .  In the context of complaint intake, lack of effect shall 
be reported if there is specific evidence that the reporter did not think the product 
achieved expected pharmacological action/therapeutic benefit evidenced b y 
statements such as or similar to “the product di d not work/perform as expected”;
Medication error involving a J&J product (with or without patient exposure to the 
J&J product, e.g. , product name [CONTACT_186073]); or
Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a J&J product.
13.5.1. Exposure In Utero
A
n exposure in utero (EIU) occurs if:

Version 2: 19 July 2018 - Administrative Change/Non -substantial Amendment [ADDRESS_823380] menses prior to conception 
through the delivery  of the baby . 
2.There is a possibility  of intrauterine exposure to IP via semen from the male partner 
who is taking /using the IP at the time of concepti on, thereb y possibly exposing the 
fetus to the product. 
If an EIU occurs, the Investigator or designee should inform the Sponsor immediately . This 
must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred. The site must complete a 
Pregnancy  Notification andUpdate Form and send it securel y to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of the site’s awareness. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of 
delivery  (see below for information related to induced termination of pregnancy ).This 
reporting requirements include environmental exposure to the IP in a pregnant woman (e.g., a 
nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_8897][INVESTIGATOR_4598]).  
Follow -up should be conducted to obtain pregnancy  outcome informatio n on all EIU reports. 
The Investigator will follow the pregnancy  until completion or until the pregnancy  
terminat ed(i.e., induced abortion) and then notify  the Sponsor of the outcome. The 
Investigator will provide any  updated information as a follow -up us ing the Pregnancy  
Notification and Update Form, and will report the outcome on the End of Pregnancy  
Collection Form. The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified. An EIU report is 
not created when an ectopic pregnancy  report is received since this pregnancy  is not usuall y 
viable.  Rather, an SAE case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy .  
The medicall y qualified investigator or designee (MD/DO/DMD/DDS) should follow the 
procedures for reporting SAEs if the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for 
immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomal y [including that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth, or neonatal death]).  I n the 
case of a live birth, the “normality ” of th e newborn can be assessed at the time of birth (i.e., 
no minimum follow -up period of a presumabl y normal infant is required before an End of 
Pregnancy  Collection Form can be completed).  The “normalit y” of an aborted fetus can be 
assessed b y gross visual i nspection, unless pre -abortion test findings are suggestive of a 
congenital anomal y.  
Additional pregnancy  outcomes that are classified as SAEs and should be reported as such 
include: 
 “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
 All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_823381] to 
causality .
 Any infant death after [ADDRESS_823382] Naproxen Sodium 220 mg Tablet

The Sponsor will be responsible for the statistical anal ysis of study  data. Detailed 
methodology  for the statistical anal ysis of the data will be documented in a Statistical 
Analy sis Plan finalized and approved prior to database lock and release of randomization 
codes.
14.1. Sample Size Determination 
A sample size of 150 per group for the active treatment arms was chosen based on 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics modeling and simulation using data from previous 
studies [3]. Based on the modeling, it was determined that 150 subjects per active treatment 
arm would be needed to provide 90% power to reject the null hy pothesis of equal 
distributions for time to confirmed perceptible relief, when comparing Test NPX tablets with 
 table ts, using a two -sided test at the 0.[ADDRESS_823383] 
50 subjects per treatment arm provides greater than 90% power to reject the null hy pothesis 
of equal distributions for time to confirmed perceptible relief when comparing Test NPX 
tablet and placebo assuming median times to relief of [ADDRESS_823384] 5% of the subjects. The per -protocol set will exclude 
subjects who took rescue medication within [ADDRESS_823385] deviation, median and range (min, max). For categorical variables, 
the number and percent of subjects in each response category  will be presented.

Previous and concomitant medications will be coded. Previous medications will be those tha t 
were discontinued before the surgery  day. Concomitant medications will be those continued 
through, or started on, the surgery  day and up through the 12 -hour assessment period. In 
addition, those medications taken after the 12 -hour assessment period throu gh the follow-up 
interview for an AE will be considered concomitant medications. Medications taken after the 
12-hour assessment through the follow-up call that were not taken for an AE will not be 
collected on the CRF or summarized. Previous medications an d concomitant medications 
will be summarized by  [CONTACT_363858]. Number and percentage of subjects

Theinvestigator (s)/institutions(s) will permit study  related monitoring, audits, I RB/IEC 
review, and regulatory  inspection(s) by  [CONTACT_363862]/documents.
15.1. Study Monitoring
Before an investigational site can enter a subject into the study , a representative of JJ CIwill 
visit the investigational study  site to:
Determine the adequacy  of the facilities
Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities the site's 
responsibility  with regard to protocol adherence as well as the study  and 
monitoring responsibilities of J&Jor its representatives.  Th ese responsibilities 
will be documented in a Clinical Study  Agreement between J&J and the 
investigator.
During the study , a monitor from J&Jor representative will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the fol lowing:
Provide information and support to the investigator(s)
Confirm that facilities remain acceptable
Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are 
being accuratel y recorded in the CRFs , and that investigational produc t 
accountability  checks are being performed
Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the 
CRFs with the subject ’ssource documents, e.g., written medical records, 
electronic 
medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], subject diaries/journals and 
other records relevant to the study .  This will require direct access to all original 
records for each subject (e.g.,clinic charts).
Record and report all protocol deviations not previously  sent to J&J .  The 
Investigator should 
not deviate from the Protocol except if specified b y the 
Sponsor or within the Protocol.  
Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly  documented on CRFs and confirm 
any SAEs have been forwarded to J&Jand those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting to Regulato ry Authority /Competent Authority  and/or IRB/IEC, as 
applicable , have been forwarded to the required authorities.  The monitor will be 
available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs information or 
study -related direction .

Authorized representatives of J&J, a regulatory /competent authority , an IRB/IEC 
representative may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data 
verification.  The purpose of a J&Jaudit or inspection is to sy stematically and independentl y 
examine all study -related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were 
conducted, and data were recorded, analy zed, and accuratel y reported according to the 
protocol, GCP guidelines of the I CHE6, and any  applicabl e regulatory  requirements.  The 
investigator should notify  the Sponsor (e.g., Study  Manager , Monitor )listed within the 
protocol or other contacts provided immediately  if contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y a regulatory  agency  about an

17.1. Case Report Forms / Electronic Data Capture
All data will be collected on source documents first and then recorded in an Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) sy stem. The EDC s ystem is the database where pertinent study data are 
collected such as demog raphy, subject randomization, efficacy assessments, adverse events, 
and subject disposition. EDC CRFs should be completed for each included subject. The 
completed pages of the EDC system are the sole propert y of the Sponsor and should not be 
made available in anyform to third parties, except for authorized representatives of the 
Sponsor or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from the Sponsor .
It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve a ll 
information captured in the EDC. The subject ’s data in the EDC s ystem must be 
electronically signed by [CONTACT_737]. These signatures serve to attest that the information 
contained in the EDC system is true. At all times, the Investigator has final personal 
responsibility for the accuracy and authenticit y of all clinical and laboratory data entered in 
the EDC. Subject source documents are the Investigator's/p hysician's subject records
maintained at the study site. In cases where the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_225945]'s chart, the information collected in the EDC must match those charts. All final 
data recorded in EDC system will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_619454] b ythe Sponsor . A co pyof 
these files will also be kept at the clinical site. All data provided in the CRF must be 
supported by  [CONTACT_363865].
17.2. Source Documents
The investigator/institution should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and 
trial records that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial subjects.  Source 
data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete.  
Changes to source data should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry , and should 
be explained if necessary (e.g., via an audit trail). Inspection and Retention of Records
17.3. Inspection and Retention of Records
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or the Sponsor, the 
investigator agrees to keep records including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], SAE forms, source documents, and detailed 
records of treatment disposition.

necessary  for J&Jor the Regulatory  Authority  to review an y documentation relating to the 
study , the Investigator must permit access to such records.
If the investigator relocates, retires, or fo r any  reason withdraws from the study , the Sponsor 
should be prospectivel y notified.  The study  records must be transferred to an acceptable 
designee, e.g., another investigator . The investigator must obtain Sponsor's written 
permission before disposing o f any records, even if retention requirements have b een met.

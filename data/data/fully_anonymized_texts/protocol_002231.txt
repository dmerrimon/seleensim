Meloxicam  Phase of Development:   3b 
Objective:   The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
preoperative dosing of N1539 30 mg in subjects undergoing colorectal surgery, including clinical laboratory tests, wound healing evaluation, incidence of anastomotic leaks, and incidence of Adverse 
Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs).  
Additional objectives include:  
• Evaluation of N1539 treatment impact on overall postoperative recovery  course, including 
total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], pain control, cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], return of bowel function, mobilization, and satisfaction with pain medication. 
Methodology:    
This is a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the  
safety and efficacy of preoperative dosing with N1539 30 mg in adult subjects undergoing open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery.   The initial study cohort will enroll approxim ately 50 subjects 
randomized (1:1) to N1539 30 mg or placebo; additional study cohorts may be enrolled following review of initial study observations. 
Adult subjects, a ge [ADDRESS_392259] 48 -72 hours, will be screened for participation at up to 
20 study site s in the [LOCATION_002].  Screening will occur  within 28 days before study drug 
administration.  After signing the informed consent , medi cal history, physical examination, laboratory 
testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), pregnancy testing, and vital sign measurements will be 
completed during the screening visit. 
Study sites will follow an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol pre-, peri-, and 
postoperatively (see  Appendix C.1 ).  On the day of surgery ( DOS; Day 1), subject s will be evaluated 
to ensure they remain eligible for participation in the study .  Subjects with confirmed eligibility  will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_318796] (op en vs laparoscopic) and randomized to either N1539 [ADDRESS_392260] dose of study drug 
approximately 30 minutes prior to the start of surgery (defined as time of first incision).  The start time 
of first dose of study drug administration  (Dose 1)  will be used to schedule subsequent doses.  
Following surgery (end of surgery defined as the time of last suture; referenced as Hour 0), subjects 
will receive a standardized care regimen per the specified ERAS protocol, including rescue analgesia, 
mobilization, and diet advancing guidelines (see  Appendix C.1 ).  Subjects will continue to receive 
study drug every [ADDRESS_392261] 48 -72 hours after 
surgery or so long as inpatient care is clinically appropriate .  A final dose of study drug  may be 
administered up to 4 hours early in subjects who are scheduled to be discharged.  Subjects who do not 
receive a dose of study drug for >  [ADDRESS_392262] 2017   SYNOPSIS (PAGE 2 OF 7)

Every [ADDRESS_392289] 2017  1. INTRODUCTION 
Since the year 2000, when the Joint Commission revised their standards for the assessment and 
management of pain, the treatment of pain has taken an increasingly significant position in 
medical care.  Often referred to as the “fifth vital sign”, subjects must now be routinely evaluated 
for pain symptoms so that therapy may be appropriately adjusted. 
While this increased focus has brought more attention to the issue of subject  comfort and quality 
of life, our range of tools has remained largely the same.  Current medications run the gamut in 
duration of activity, ranging from acute medications that provide relief for [ADDRESS_392290] to provide relief (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl) 
(Swarm,  2007).  The result, while there is generally not a ceiling on the effect provided by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_318740], the use of high doses, and multiple opi[INVESTIGATOR_318741], which may force a decision between symptoms and side effects  
N1539 was initially developed as  an injectable form of meloxicam for the short- term 
management of moderate to severe acute pain using proprietary NanoCrystal
® technology.  
N1539 was acquired by [CONTACT_318798], Inc. (Recro) in April 2015, at which time, Recro assumed its development. 
Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the enolic acid class that 
possesses anti -inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities, which are believed to be 
related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)  and subsequent reduction in prostaglandin 
biosynthesis (Turck, 1997; Del Tacca, 2002; Mobic 2016).  
Meloxicam has been marketed for over a decade as the oral agent, Mobic.  Mobic tablets and 
suspension are indicated for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
arthritis and the relief of the signs and symptoms of pauciarticular or polyarticular course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients 2 ye ars or older.    
Meloxicam has a slow onset of action, largely due to poor water solubility, and is not currently 
approved for the treatment of acute pain.  It has a prolonged absorption, with the time of maximum observed plasma concentration (t
max) being approximately 5 -6 hours following oral 
administration (Degner,  1997; Turck,  1997), which is consistent with its poor aqueous solubility.  
By [CONTACT_318799], the proprietary NanoCrystal 
technology should provi de a faster onset of action of meloxicam, thus providing a suitable 
treatment of acute pain via the intravenous (IV) route  
Prior evaluations of N1539 have included postoperative dosing, before and after the onset of pain symptoms.  While administration of N1539 postoperatively has been well tolerated with a 
favorable safety and efficacy profile.  It is unknown whether any differences in surgical outcome or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318742], where the use of N1539 could further reduce the requirement for opi[INVESTIGATOR_83269].  This study is designed to evaluate the 
safety  and efficacy of preoperative dosing with N1539 in subjects undergoing open or 
laparoscopic colorectal surgery , prior to expanding into larger subject enrollment.     
See the N1539 Investigator’s Brochure for more information about the compound.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of preoperative 
dosing of N1539 30 mg in subjects undergoing colorectal surg ery, including clinical laboratory 
tests, wound healing evaluation, incidence of anastomotic leaks, and incidence of Adverse 
Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs).  
Additional objectives include: 
• Evaluation of N1539 treatment impact on overall postoperative recovery course, 
including total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], pain control, cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210], return of bowel function, mobilization, and satisfaction with pain medication.

Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392292] 2017  3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter study evaluating 
the safety and efficacy of preoperative dosing with N1539 30 mg in adult subjects undergoing 
open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery.  The initial study cohort will enroll approxima tely 
50 subjects randomized (1:1) to N1539 30 mg or placebo; additional study cohorts may be 
enrolled following review of initial study observations. 
Adult subjects, age [ADDRESS_392293] 48 -72 hours, will be screened for 
participation at up to 20 study site s in the [LOCATION_002].  Screening will occur  within 28 days 
before study drug administration.  After signing the informed consent, medical history, physical 
examination, laboratory testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), pregnancy testing, and vital sign measurements  will be completed during the screening visit. 
Study sites will follow an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol pre -, peri -, and 
postoperatively (see Appendix C.1).  On the day of surgery ( DOS; Day 1), subject s will be 
evaluated to ensure they remain eligible for participation in the study .  Subjects with confirmed 
eligibility  will be stratified by [CONTACT_318796] (open vs laparoscopic) and randomized  to either 
N1539 [ADDRESS_392294] dose of study drug approximately 30 minutes prior to the start of surgery (defi ned as time of 
first incision).  The start time of first dose of study drug administration  (Dose 1) will be used to 
schedule subsequent doses.  
Following surgery (end of surgery defined as the time of last suture; referenced as Hour 0), 
subjects will receive a standardized care regimen per the specified ERAS protocol, including 
rescue analgesia, mobilization, and diet advancing guidelines (see Appendix C.1) .  Subjects will 
continue to receive study drug every [ADDRESS_392295] 48 -72 hours after surgery or so long as inpatient care is clinically appropriate.  A final dose 
of study drug may be administered up to 4 hours early in subjects who are scheduled to be discharged.   Subjects who do not receive a dose of study drug for >  28 hours following their 
previous dose of study drug should be considered off treatment, and should not receive further 
doses of study d rug.   
Subjects may be discharged from the study center based on their clinical status, with safety 
assessments performed at the earlier of 1 day (24 hours) following their last study dose (LSD+1) or at the time of discharge.  Subjects will be provided standard of care analgesic regimen  for pain 
management after discharge from the study center . 
All treated  subjects will be followed through 30 days after discharge.  A ll subjects will return to 
the study center to complete follow-up visit 1 (FUV- 1) at [ADDRESS_392296]- discharge, with follow-
up visit 2 (FUV-2) completed by [CONTACT_756] [ADDRESS_392297] 2017  Assessments of efficacy will includ e total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], pain intensity according to an 
11-point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS; 0 - 10) on first ambulation , time to first analgesic 
rescue, time to return of bowel function (including time to first flatus or bowel sounds, and first 
bowel movement), time to mobilization (including time to first assisted mobilization out of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318743]), patient global 
assessment of pain control, brief pain inventory, subject satisfaction, time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] 
(including time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318744]), 
incidence of  nasogastric ( NG) tube insertion, length of stay, incidence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318745], and  total cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
3.2. Rationale for Study Design and Control Groups 
This study will evaluate the safety  and efficacy  of repeated dosing with N1539 with  the first dose 
of N1539 administered prior to colorectal surgery.   Previous research has demonstrated the 
safety  and efficacy  of single and repeated doses of N1539 administered after surgery in a range 
of postoperative populations, including open hysterectomy, bunionectomy, and abdominoplasty, 
along with a range o f majo r surgeries including orthopedic and abdominal surgeries.   
This study will further explore the safety and efficacy of N1539 when administered 
preoperatively  on a once daily schedule, in a population of subjects undergoing colorectal 
surgery.  Preoperative dosing is anticipated to reduce the need for postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], thereby [CONTACT_318800], return of bowel function, and pain control satisfaction.  However, it is unknown whether 
preoperative dosing may have other consequences on the safety of treated subjects.  The 
inclusion of a placebo control group will support the comparison of safety results observed in 
N1539 treated subjects. 
As the first preoperative evaluation of N1539, this s tudy will initially enroll a limited cohort of 
approximately [ADDRESS_392298] meet all of the following criteria to be considered eligible to participate in the

6.5. Clinical Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_137540] a significant safety risk posed  
towards study subjects.  Potential safety risks will be evaluated continuously throughout the 
course of enrollment in the study.  
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392335] 2017  7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meet ing the criteria 
and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) as provided in this 
protocol.  During the study, when there is a safety evaluation, the investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting AEs and SAEs, as detailed in this section of the protocol. 
7.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study drug. Any abnormal laboratory value 
deemed clinically significant b y the investigator, regardless of causal relationship, must be 
reported as an AE.  
Examples of an AE include the following: 
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication under 
study 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either an increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (eg, abnormal physical examination 
finding) 
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction 
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study drug or a 
concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, unless 
nonserious or serious sequelae occur) 
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE 
• Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) (including 
laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
• The diseas e or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with a greater 
frequency than expected for the subject’s condition  
All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, and regardless of 
causality, will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF beginning after administration of study drug 
through end of the study (ie, Day 30).   
7.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is defined as any event that meets the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392336] 2017  • Is immediately life -threatening (ie, presents an immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred; this does not include an AE had it occurred in a more serious form may have 
caused death).   
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
perform normal life functions.   
• Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
•  Results in prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
•  Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in  the offspring of a subject using the study drug 
regardless of time to diagnosis). 
•  Is considered an important medical event. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an AE is serious 
when considering important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed that define a SAE. Examples of such 
medical even ts that may also be considered serious include, but are not limited to, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_275547] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline does not meet the definition of a SAE. Social or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137541] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318768] a SAE.  
SAEs will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF after the signing of informed consent through the end of the study ( ie, Day 30). If an investigator becomes aware of a SAE or death that occurs 
more than [ADDRESS_392337] receives study drug and the investigator considers the event to be related to the study drug, he/she is obligated to report the SAE to the sponsor. 
7.3. Recordin g and Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, symptoms, or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs or symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE. 
7.3.1. Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study, using his or her clinical judgment. The intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF  should be assigned to one of the following categories: 
• Mild: an event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and does 
not interfere with everyday activities  
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392338] 2017  • Moderate: an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities  
• Severe:  an event that prevents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severity is a term used to describe the intensity of a specific event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. The 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache). This is not the same as serious, which is based on the subject’s or event’s outcome or 
on action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or 
functioning (see Section  7.2). 
7.3.2. Assessment of Causality  
The investigator must record the causal relat ionship of each event  in the eCRF, and additionally 
for SAEs, on the SAE reporting form .  An investigator's causality assessment is the 
determinatio n of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or 
contributed to an AE .  
• Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and 
the AE.   
• Not related: The AE  is due to underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another drug or 
event and is not related to the study drug (eg, has a more likely alternate etiology and / or a temporal relationship does not suggest a causal relationship).   
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it is 
important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
transmitting the SAE reporting form and completing the AE eCRF page(s). The causality 
assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The 
investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_318769] -up information and 
amend the SAE reporting form and AE eCRF page(s) accordingly. 
7.3.3. Assessment of Outcome  
All AEs and SAEs must be followed until they are resolved, the condition stabilizes, the events 
are otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. The investigator will assess the 
outcome of the event(s) by [CONTACT_137582]:  
• Resolved:  The event resolved and the subject returned to baseline.  
• Resolving:  At last observation, the event was improving. 
• Resolved with sequelae:  The event resolved but the subject is left with residual problems (eg, functional deficits)  
• Not resolved: At the last observation, the event was unchanged.  
• Unknown:  There were no observations after the onset (initial observation or report) of the event, and the status of the event is unknown. 
• Death ( Fatal) :  To be selected for the one AE, which in the judgement of the investigator 
was the primary  cause of death.  
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392339]’s condition. All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact [CONTACT_318808], the condition stabilizes, the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. Any additional events that are relevant to the ongoing event will be documented. 
The investigator will ensure that follow -up information relevant to SAEs is provided to the 
sponsor and includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic 
examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the n ature 
of the event, the cause of the event, or both. 
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE reporting form 
and entered into the eCRF pages, with all changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_093]. The updated SAE reporting form should be resubmitted to the sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section 7.5. 
7.5. Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor 
Once the investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE, he or she must notify the sponsor within [ADDRESS_392340] BE REPORTED TO THE SPONSOR IMMEDIATELY (within 24 
hours).  
COMPLETE THE SAE DETAILS REPORTING FORM AND FORWARD BY [CONTACT_318809] : 
 
Medical Safety Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Telephone: 484 -395-2470 
eFax: [PHONE_6666] 
eMail: [EMAIL_6230]
 
 
In the initial eMail, the investigator must provide to the sponsor the following eCRF pages, completed to the greatest extent possible:  
• AE record  
• Medical history  
• Prior and concomitant medications  
Also, the following documents are to be forwarded: any laboratory results, diagnostic test results, or medical reports relevant to the SAE.  
E-mail transmission is the preferred method to transmit SAE information. In rare circumstances 
and in the absence of e- mail capacity, notification by [CONTACT_39984], with a copy 
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392341] promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section  7.5 “Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor.” The 
sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_318810], be 
reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects are met.  
For the purposes of IND safety reporting, expectedness of t he SAE will be assessed by [CONTACT_103].  A SAE is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
The s ponsor will determine whether the SAE meets regulatory reporting criteria (ie, 7 - or 15 -day 
repor t) in compliance with local and regional law. If so, the sponsor (or the sponsor’s 
representative) will report the event to the appropriate regulatory authoritie s. The sponsor will 
report SAEs to the central IRB/EC and the investigator will be report SAE to their local to 
institutional review board (IRB) /EC. Investigator letters are prepared according to sponsor policy 
and are forwarded to the investigators as necessary. An investigator letter is prepared for any 
SAE that is attributable to study drug, serious, and unexpected. The purpose of the investigator 
letter is to fulfill specific regulatory and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements regarding 
the product under investigation. 
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with 
requirements related to the reportin g of SAEs to the IRB or IEC. 
7.7. Special Reporting Situations: Pregnancy  
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue further study drug administration and should be followed through delivery or termination of the pregnancy.  A subject s hould be instructed to also notify the investigator immediately if she becomes pregnant 
within [ADDRESS_392342] be notified of all pregnancies reported to the investigator (see Section 7.[ADDRESS_392343] information). 
Any uncomplicated pregnancy that occurs in a subject during this clinical study will be reported 
for tracking purposes only. All subject pregnancies that are identified during or after this study, 
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392344] occurred within 30 days of 
receiving study drug need to be reported, followed to conclusion (delivery or termination), and 
the outcome reported, even if the subject is discontinued from the study. The investigator should report all pregnancies within 24 hours using the Pregnancy Report/Outcome Form, according to 
the usual timelines and directions for SAE reporting provided in Section 7.5. Monitoring of the 
pregnancy should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy; and follow- up detailing the 
outcome of the pregnancy submitted using the Pregnancy Re port/Outcome Form.  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_318770] a contraceptive medication. Likewise, elective abortions without complications are not considered AEs.  
Any SAEs associated with pregnancy (eg, congenital abnormalities/birth defects/spontaneous 
miscarriages or any other serious events) must additionally be reported as such using the SAE report form according to the usual timelines and directions for SAE reporting provided in 
Section  7.5.

8.3. General Considerations for Statistical Analysis  
8.3.1. Analysis Datasets  
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set:  The ITT set will include all eligible subjects who were 
randomized.  The ITT subjects may or may not receive randomized treatment  and may or may 
not have the scheduled surgery. 
Safety Set:  The safety set will include all treated subjects and will be used for safety and 
tolerability assessments.   
Efficacy analysis set will include all safety analysis set subjects who had the scheduled sur gery.  
Subjects whose surgery was  cancelled , whose surgery was changed will be excluded from the 
efficacy analysis , or who required NG tube use (placed perioperatively) beyond Hour 24.   
Efficacy analysis set will be the primary population  for efficacy evaluation, but additional 
sensitivity analysis may be performed based on the ITT analysis set.  
8.3.2. Test Hypothesis and P Value Justification 
Each efficacy analysis will be performed to assess the differences between the 2 treatment 
groups ; diffe rence will be derived by N1539 [ADDRESS_392348] s at the 0.05 level of significance.  
Nominal p -value will be reported as is .  
Details for study -wise Type 1 error control, including interim analyses, final co- primary efficacy 
endpoints analyses, and final secondary efficacy endpoints, will be discussed in the formal SAP. 
8.3.3. Procedures for Handling Missing Data  
Unless indicated otherwise (see Section 8.3.5), no imputation will be done for missing data.  
However, AEs with missing severity assessments will be tabulated as “severe,” and AEs with 
missing relationship assessments will be tabulated as “related” for the purpose of analysis; and 
the missing data will be presented in data listing as is.  
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392349] follow -up (FUV -2) to be conducted 30 ±  [ADDRESS_392350]- discharge.

Time to event endpoints will be derived for each subject.  Subjects without the event will be 
censored at time of last evaluation  during inpatient treatment phase .  Differences between the 
groups in time to event endpoints will be analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards analysis 
model that include the main effects of treatment and investigational sites; proportion of subjects 
censored will be presented and the time to event percentiles (25%, 50%, and 75% tiles) will be 
estimated.  The data will be graphically display using a Kaplan- Meier (KM) survival curve by 
[CONTACT_1570] .  
8.5.4. Length of Stay (LOS) 
Length of stay will be defined as days from the date of admissio n to the date of actual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].  LOS will be tabulated with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_318813].     
8.5.5. PGA of Pain Control 
The n umber and percent of subjects in each global pain control category (0-poor, 1- fair, 2 -good, 
3-very good, or 4- excellent) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  The difference between the 
groups in global pain control will be evaluated based  on proportion of subjects rating their pain 
control as good, very good, or excellent using the CMH  test controlling for investigational site .   
8.5.6. Brief Pain Inventory  
Responses to each BPI [INVESTIGATOR_318779] , 
including score for each question (referred to as the item score), score for each domain (referred to as the domain score), and score for each subdomain (referred to as the sub-dimension score), 
change from baseline in item score, domain score, and sub-dimension score ( Cleeland 2009). 
Differences between the treatment groups in domain score, sub-dimension score, and item score, 
as well as change from baseline in scores will be analyzed by [CONTACT_318814], and baseline score as a covariate.     
8.5.7. Subject Satisfaction for Postoperative Pain Medication 
Subjects will be categorized as dissatisfied (completely dissatisfied [1], mostly dissatisfied [2], or somewhat dissatisfied [3]) , neither satisfied or dissatisfied (4), or satisfied (somewhat satisfied 
[5], mostly satisfied [6], or completely satisfied [7]) with postoperative pain medication .  The 
number and percent of subj ects in each category will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  The 
difference between t he groups in satisfaction with postoperative pain medication  will be 
Recro Pharma, Inc.

Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392359] of the Study and Ethics Approval  
This study will be conducted according to GCP; US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CF R) 
Part 50 (Protection of Human Subjects); US 21 CFR Part  56 (IRBs); US 21 CFR Part  54 
(Financial Disclosure); International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidance for Industry, E6 GCP: Consolidated Guidance; the Nuremberg Code; and, where applicable the principles of 
the Declaration of Helsinki (Recommendations guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research 
Involving Human Subjects), and with the NH&MRC National Statement on Ethical Conduct in 
Human Research (2007).   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Ethics Committees  
The investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for ensuring that this protocol, the 
site’s informed consent form, and any other information that will be presented to potential 
subjects (e.g., advertisements or information that supports or supplements the informed consent form) are reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_196490].  The investigator agrees to 
allow the IRB or IEC direct access to all relevant documents.  The IRB or IEC must be 
constituted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements.  The sponsor will provide the investigator with relevant documents or data needed for IRB or IEC review and approval of 
the study.  Before investigational products can be shipped to the site, the sponsor must receive 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_196453], the approved informed consent form, and any other information that the IRB or IEC has approved for presentation to potential subjects. 
If the protocol, the informed consent form, or any other information that the IRB or IEC has 
approved for presentation to potential subjects is amended during the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the IRB or IEC reviews and approves, where applicable, these 
amended documents.  The investigator must follow all applicable regulatory requirements 
pertaining to the use of an amended informed consent form, including obtaining IRB or IEC 
approval of the amended form, before new subjects consent to take part in the study using the 
new version of the form.  The investigator must promptly forward to the sponsor copi[INVESTIGATOR_318792].  IRB or IEC approval of the 
consent forms must be obtained in addition to the approval given for the clinical study.  
Regulatory review and approval may be required in some countries before IRB or IEC approval can be sought. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. General Considerations  
The ethical standards defined within GCP are intended to ensure the following: 
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392360] 2017  • Human subjects are provided with an adequate understanding of the possible risks of 
their participation in the study, and they have a free choice to participate or not. 
• The study is conducted with diligence and in conformance with the protocol in such a 
way as to ensure the integrity of the findings. 
• The potential benefits of the research justify the risks. 
Recro Pharma, Inc. is the sponsor of study REC -17-024.  The sponsor is responsible for all of the 
following: 
• selecting qualified investigators  
• providing investigators with the information they need to conduct the investigation 
properly 
• ensuring proper monitoring of the investigation 
• ensuring that appropriate regulatory agencies and all participating investigators are 
properly informed of significant new information regardin g AEs or risks associated with 
N1539 
9.1.3. Informed Consent  
The sponsor will provide investigators with a sample informed consent form for this study.  
Investigators are encouraged to use the sample form; however, they may adapt the information to suit the needs of their institution, if necessary (although it must reflect the required elements of 
informed consent specified in 21 CFR Part 50.25).  The final informed consent form must be 
accepted by [CONTACT_196491].  Investigators must provide the sponsor with an unsigned copy of the final informed consent form before and after it is approved 
by [CONTACT_4186].  If any new information becomes available that might affect subjects’ 
willingness to participate in the study, or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to the informed consent form, the sponsor will provide investigators with a revised informed 
consent form.  The IRB or IEC must provide written approval of any revisions to the informed 
consent form in advance of its use. 
Investigators must provide subjects with all the information necessary to make an informed 
decision about their participation in the study, including the nature and intended purpose of the 
study, possible benefits, and possible risks. 
All information in th e informed consent form should be provided in a language (whether written 
or spoken) that is as nontechnical as practical and that is understandable to the subjects. 
Before written informed consent is obtained, the subject should be given ample time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study.  All questions must be answered to the satisfaction of the subject (or his or her legally authorized representative). 
Before a subject undergoes procedures specific to the protocol, the informed consent form must 
be signed and dated by [CONTACT_423] (or his or her legally authorized representative) and any other signatories as required by [CONTACT_4186]. 
If a subject (or legally authorized representative) cannot read, a short form approved by [CONTACT_318819].  Only the short form itself is to be signed by [CONTACT_318820], Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392361] 2017  representative.  However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, 
and the person obtaining the consent shall sign the copy of the summary in accor dance with 
21 CFR  50.27 (b2).  
After all required signatures have been obtained, a copy of the informed consent form should be provided to the subject, and the original must be kept on file at the site and made available for 
review by [CONTACT_456].  Documentation of the informed consent discussion must be noted in the subject’s case history.  
9.1.4. Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The investigator is responsible for completing and maintaining adequate and accurate eCRF s and 
source documentation.  Source documentation constitutes original records (first point of entry, either hard copy or electronic), which may include progress notes, medication administration records, operation reports, laboratory reports, discharge summaries, and so on.   
9.2. Study Monitoring  
The sponsor is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study with regard to subject protection, ethics, protocol adherence, site procedures, and integrity of the data.  At regular 
intervals during the study, the sponsor’s study monitors will contact [CONTACT_318821], telephone calls, and letters in order to review study progress and eCRF  completion and 
to address any concerns or questions regarding the study conduct.  During monitoring visits, the 
following aspects of study conduct will be carefully reviewed: subjects’ informed consent 
documents, subject recruitment procedures, subjects’ compliance with the study procedures, source-data verification, drug accountability, use of concomitant therapy by [CONTACT_1766], AE and SAE documentation and reporting, and quality of data. 
9.3. Quality Assurance  
The sponsor, a regulatory authority, or an IRB representative may visit the study site at any time during the study or after completion of the study to perform audits or inspections.  The purpose of a sponsor audit or regulatory inspection is to examine systematically and independently all 
study- related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted 
according to the protocol, GCP, ICH guidelines, and any other applicable regulatory requirements.  Investigators should contact [CONTACT_167449] a regulatory agency about an inspection at their site. 
9.4. Study and Site Closure  
If the sponsor, investigator, or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions arising during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the study site should be 
closed, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the sponsor and 
investigator.  Conditions that may warrant terminatio n of the study include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 
• discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in the 
study 
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_392362] 2017  • submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the sponsor, 
study monito r, or regulatory agencies 
• failure of the investigator to comply with GCP (e.g., ICH guidelines, regulatory agency guidelines) 
• insufficient adherence to protocol requirements or an unacceptably high rate of missing, erroneous, or improperly collected data 
• evidence from the blinded data of sufficient technical problems with the study that one 
could believe with a high degree of certainty that subjects are being exposed to the 
investigational drug without a realistic expectation of evaluable data  
• a decision on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing evaluation or 
development of the product 
• failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate  
9.5. Records Retention  
9.5.1. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
The investigator agrees to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the privacy of subjects’ health information, including, but not limited to, 
the Standards for Individually Identifiable Health Information, 45 CFR Parts  160 and 164 (the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 privacy regulation).  The

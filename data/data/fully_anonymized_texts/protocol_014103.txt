UNITY Biotechnology, Inc. 2 Confidential SUMMARY OF CHANGES: AMENDMENT [ADDRESS_669190] been made to provide clarity and 
are captured in the redlined document. 
The principal components of change to the study are described in the table below. 
Area of change Rationale
Repeat dose arm added and instead of a 
sham control there is an active control 
[Synopsis ] and [ Section 4.2 Design 
Rationale ] [Section 6.[ADDRESS_669191] ] and 
[Section 7.6 Administration of aflibercept ] Repeat dose arm was incorporated after 
additional data from the First-in-Human study 
suggested that a single injection may not be 
sufficient to all patients. A repeat dose of 
UBX1325 can potentially be beneficial 
clinically with elimination of additional 
senescent cells. 
Active control arm replaced the sham control 
in order to make the standard of care 
consistent 
Increased duration of follow-up from 
16 weeks to 24 weeks 
Increased overall study duration from 20 to 
22 months 
[Synopsis ] and [ Section 6.[ADDRESS_669192] ] To assess longer term effect of study drug 
through repeat IVT injection of UBX1325. The 
number of study visits aligns with standard of 
care to see wet AMD patients every 4 weeks. 
Added Aflibercept run-in: Once patients meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will receive a 
single run-in injection of aflibercept 
approximately -8 to -4 weeks prior to Day 1 
[Synopsis ] and [ Section 6.[ADDRESS_669193] ] To homogenize the patient population
Updated primary objective to include 
biological activity and primary endpoints to 
include changes in BCVA from Baseline 
within group at any or all visits 
Secondary and exploratory objectives and 
endpoints were also updated 
[Synopsis ] and 
[Section 3.0 Objectives and Endpoints ] To align with current objectives following the 
interim results of the UBX1325-01 study 
Sample size increased and order of efficacy 
endpoints was shifted putting BCVA changes 
at the top. 
[Synopsis ] and [ Section 3 Objectives and 
Endpoints ] and [ Section 9.2 Determination of 
Sample Size ] Sample size was recalculated based on the 
new primary efficacy endpoint and overall list 
of endpoints better aligns with key endpoints 
in future wet AMD studies

The principal components of change to the study are described in the table below. 
Area of change Rationale
Clarifications include: 
 Post-dose anterior and posterior 
segment evaluations and intraocular 
pressure are to be assessed in only the 
SE, not OU 
 Data collection of anti-VEGF in the 
preceding [ADDRESS_669199]-A/FA/FP should be assessed at 
Screening instead of Day [ADDRESS_669200] of care and utilized 
consistently for sham and IVT 
injections. Medications used for 
numbing should be documented as 
concomitant medication  Fluorescein used for IOP and 
IVFA/OCT-A should be documented as 
concomitant medication 
 Treatment for the fellow eye should be 
completed at least 7 days from 
treatment of the SE. Treatment of the 
fellow eye during Screening is permitted 
since aflibercept run-in is open label. Incorporate Protocol Clarification Memo #1 
dated 17Feb2022 and Protocol Clarification 
Memo #[ADDRESS_669201]. Method for 
taking temperature should be consistent 
throughout the study. 
 AEs and SAEs are collected after 
aflibercept run-in during Screening

Extended the duration from 24 weeks to 
48 weeks 
Added 2 additional injections of UBX1325 at 
Weeks 24 and 28 in the UBX1325 arm 
Added coadministration of UBX1325 with 
aflibercept at Week 24 and 32 in the aflibercept 
arm 
[Synopsis ] and [ Section 3 Objectives and 
Endpoints ] and [ Section 6.[ADDRESS_669203] ] 
and [ 7.7 Coadministration of Aflibercept and 
UBX1325 or Sham ]To study the safety, tolerability, and 
biological activity of 2 additional UBX1325 
injections through 48 weeks, as well as

studied. 
Elaborated on the dosing interval and schedule 
as well as findings of IVT administration of 
UBX1325 in combination with aflibercept from 
the GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
[Section [IP_ADDRESS] Toxicology ] To support coadministration of UBX1325 
with aflibercept 
Clarified that for Unscheduled Visit, 
tests/procedures can be performed as PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_516292]/procedures should 
be performed.

complete PE is required at Screening, 
Visit 8/Week 24, Visit 14/Week [ADDRESS_669205] 
this complete PE and enter any 
abnormalities or changes in EDC 
 Per previous protocol, "For visits with 
masked study drug, FE treatment is to 
be completed 7 days from SE treatment 
(e.g., D1, Week 4, 8, 16, 24, 28, 32, 
and 40)."   
This restriction is being removed from 
the protocol in the latter 24 weeks of the 
study to allow Investigators greater 
clinical discretion of when it is 
appropriate to treat the fellow eye.  At 
Visit 8/Week 24, Visit 9/Week 28, Visit 
10/Week 32 and Visit 12/Week 40, the 
SE treatment and FE treatment no 
longer require a separation window of 7 
days. Please ensure however that the 
FE treatment is done after SE 
treatment. Per protocol, AE collection begins after Incorporate Protocol Clarification Memo #3

Tolerability and Evidence of Activity of a Repeat Intravitreal 
Injection of UBX1325 in Patients with Neovascular Age-Related 
Macular Degeneration (wet AMD)
Phase Phase 2 
Study Design This is a Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept (POC) study. Approximately 
46 patients will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 into the repeat 
IVT injections of UBX1325 or active-control (aflibercept) and 
coadministration of UBX1325 study arms, in order to assess the 
primary and secondary objectives. All patients will be followed for 
approximately [ADDRESS_669215] corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between 70 to 20 Early 
Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters 
(equivalent to 20/40 to 20/400 on the Snellen chart) at Screening 
Number of Patients Approximately 46 patients
Length of Participation Run-in: Once patients meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will 
receive a single run-in injection of aflibercept approximately -8 
to -4 weeks prior to Day 1  
On treatment: On Day 1, patients will be randomized to either 
the UBX1325 arm or the aflibercept arm. 
Patients randomized to the UBX1325 arm will receive UBX1325 
on Day 1, Weeks 4, 24, and 28; and sham procedure on Weeks 
8, 16, 24, 32, and 40. 
Patients randomized to the active-control aflibercept arm will 
receive aflibercept per active-control every 8 weeks starting from 
day 1 until Week 40. In addition, these patients will receive 
UBX1325 on Week 24 and Week 32; and a sham procedure at 
Week 4 and Week 28. 
On study:  Up to a total of approximately 56 weeks (8-week 
screening period + IVT of aflibercept at -8 to -4 weeks + 48-week 
follow-up period)

Version 4.0 
UNITY Biotechnology, Inc. 28 Confidential 2 INTRODUCTION 
UBX1325 is a new molecular entity that is being investigated by [CONTACT_516317], Inc. (the 
Sponsor) for the treatment of neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wet AMD) and 
other retinovascular diseases. 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe, irreversible vision loss in 
people age 60 and over. The neovascular form (wet AMD) is an advanced stage, which is 
responsible for the most severe vision loss (S chlottmann et al., 2017) . It is an acquired disease 
of the macula characterized by [CONTACT_516318]-onset 
neurodegeneration of the photoreceptor-retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_516294] 
(Al-Zamil and Yassin 2017 ). 
As many as [ADDRESS_669220] some form of AMD. This number is expected to 
double to nearly 22 million by 2050. Age is a prominent risk factor for AMD. The risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_516295] 2% for those ages 50-59, to nearly 30% for those 
over the age of 75 ( Bright Focus Foundation 2020 ). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_516296]-VEGF therapy, patients experience an increased burden of treatment 
due to frequent injections and multiple office visits to assess treatment response. This presents 
a burden on patients and providers and ultimately results in reduced patient adherence and an 
inconsistent response (Holz et al., 2016 ). Additionally, several retrospective studies have 
reported suboptimal responder rates for anti-VEGF agents to be as high as 10-15% 
(Otsuji et al., 2013 ; Suzuki et al., 2014). 
2.[ADDRESS_669221] common type; about 90% of people 
with AMD have dry AMD. The wet form, known as exudative or neovascular, occurs in about 
10% of those with AMD. Neovascular AMD is the cause of 80 to 90% of the severe vision loss 
cause by [CONTACT_83198] ( Cheung and Easton 2013 ). 
Early stages of AMD usually are asymptomatic and are characterized by [CONTACT_516319][INVESTIGATOR_516297] 2 disc diameters of the fovea ( Ferris et al., 2012 ). Advanced 
AMD includes geographic atrophy (GA) and wet AMD. While early and intermediate AMD cause 
only minimal visual acuity impairment, advanced AMD is the leading cause of blindness 
worldwide ( van Lookeren Campagne et al., 2014 ). 
AMD is a multifactorial blinding disease. It has been previously demonstrated that oxidative 
stress, aging, DNA damage and ultraviolet radiation can lead to AMD by [CONTACT_516320][INVESTIGATOR_43698] (RPE) cells, cellular senescence, and the 
immune-inflammatory response ( Wang et al., 2019 ). 
wet AMD is typi[INVESTIGATOR_516298] a fundus photo by [CONTACT_516321]: RPE 
and/or retinal detachment, exudates (lipid degradation products), fibrovascular scars, and 
hemorrhage. FA and OCT can be used to further characterize the vascular lesions based on 
location (subfoveal, juxtafoveal, or extrafoveal) and presenting features of drusen, atrophy, and 
neovascularization ( van Lookeren Campagne et al., 2014 ; Al-Zamil and Yassin 2017 ; 
Ferris et al., 2012 ). 
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in wet AMD is likely a secondary reaction. Stress or 
damage in the RPE and the associated immune responses are believed to promote the 
production of pro-angiogenic factors, thereby [CONTACT_516322]. In addition, degenerative changes 
Clinical Study Protocol UBX1325
UBX1325-03 
Version 4.0 
UNITY Biotechnology, Inc. 29 Confidential within the choridal vasculature are another plausible cause of pathological angiogenesis 
(van Lookeren Campagne et al., 2014 ). 
Examination of early AMD lesions indicated that loss of vessels and/or reduction of perfusion in 
the choriocapi[INVESTIGATOR_516299]. Vascular loss is often 
accompanied by [CONTACT_516323]. These asymptomatic vascular 
changes may result in hypoxia and upregulate angiogenic factors in the choroid, leading to the 
formation of pathological vessels. Among the angiogenic factors investigated, VEGF-A is found 
to be a key factor in animal models and patients. Indeed, VEGF-A inhibitors have proven to be 
safe and effective in treating wet AMD ( van Lookeren Campagne et al., 2014 ). 
2.[ADDRESS_669222] of Care  
Macular photocoagulation was studied extensively in the 1970s. Laser photocoagulation 
showed efficacy with positive visual outcomes in certain lesions. However, the adoption of laser 
photocoagulation in the treatment of wet AMD is hampered by [CONTACT_516324], including a high 
recurrence rate; a risk of producing vision loss, especially with subfoveal membranes; and a 
limited visual improvement potential. In the era of anti-VEGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the role of direct 
photocoagulation as a major treatment approach for wet AMD is waning. If used, this treatment 
should be limited to treat very small lesions outside the central macula (Al-Zamil and Yassin 2017 ). 
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was introduced in the late 1990s. It was used with a 
photosensitizer verteporfin administered intravenously to form reactive-free radicals that 
damage the vascular endothelium and induce occlusion of new vessels. The use of PDT has 
declined because of inadequate and unpredictable effects of PDT on CNV. Nowadays, the use 
of PDT is usually considered in combination with an anti-VEGF or steroid as a second line of 
therapy to nonresponders ( Al-Zamil and Yassin 2017 ). 
There are [ADDRESS_669223] 2 years are not always sustained over longer 
periods of time. This may be the result of under treatment in the real world setting or potentially 
the development of macular atrophy in these patients ( Gahn and Khanani 2018 ). 
2.3 Target Indication and Population 
This study will enroll patients 50 years of age with wet AMD with BCVA of 70 TO 20 ETDRS 
letters (equivalent to 20/40 to 20/400 on the Snellen chart). 
2.4 Scientific Rationale for UBX1325 as a Treatment for wet AMD 
The Sponsor hypothesizes that the accumulation of senescent cells (SnCs) in the retina 
contributes to retinal disease. UBX1325 is a phosphate pro-drug of the active parent molecule, 
UBX0601, an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in the retina. Inhibition of Bcl-xL leads 
to induction of apoptosis, ultimately leading to cell death. IVT administration of UBX1325 in 
mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model decreased neovascular retinal area and 
avascular area, presumably due to restoration of healthy vasculature after elimination of 
Clinical Study Protocol UBX1325
UBX1325-[ADDRESS_669224] Hayflick ( Hayflick and 
Moorhead 1961 ). Several important features of the senescence program have since been 
elucidated. Exposure to damage-inducing stimuli such as oxidative stress, radiation, and 
ischemia are among factors associated with the induction of senescence. Several studies 
(Marazita et al., 2016 ; Lamoke et al., 2015 ; Ma and Wong 2016 ) have confirmed the correlation
between these stressors and angiogenic retinal disease. SnCs produce a set of proinflammatory 
factors, cytokines, chemokines, and others that are called senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP). Although many factors of SASP have been identified in wet AMD and 
diabetic retinopathy (DR), a list of the most relevant ones associated with each disease have 
been studied and identified with many of them having a proinflammatory role ( Funk et al., 2009 ; 
Sato et al., 2018 ; Schori et al., 2018 ). 
Blasiak et al., 2017 demonstrated the role of SASP in RPE cells, photoreceptors, and 
choriocapi[INVESTIGATOR_516300], RPE cells cannot be easily replaced by 
[CONTACT_516325], autophagy, photoreceptor 
degeneration, and eventually, vision loss.
Evidence of SnCs in human retinopathies has focused on SASP and in vitro culture systems but
reports of p16+immunohistochemistry (IHC) and cell-type identification are limited. Literature 
reports suggest presence of SnCs in aged primates ( Mishima et al., 1999 ), and the proliferation 
potential of human RPE cells in vitro is suggested to be influenced by [CONTACT_516326] 
(Flood et al. 1980). Recently, Lopez-Luppo et al., 2017 reported the presence of p16+ cells in 
the retinal vasculature of aged human donors and vessels associated with microaneurysms. 
Figure 2 Immunohistochemical Staining of p16+Cells in Human Donors
AMD = age-related macular degeneration; DAPI = 4’,6-diamidino2-phenylindole; DME = diabetic macular 
edema; DR = diabetic retinopathy; N = number of patients; p16 = p16 cellular biomarker. 
Retinal sections from human donor tissue were subject to immunohistochemical staining for p16. Cell 
nuclei were stained with DAPI, and % cells positive for p16 were calculated for each donor globe.
N = 27-[ADDRESS_669225]/diabetic macular edema (DME) and AMD indicates the presence of p16+cells ( Figure 2 ). 
When quantified and compared to age-matched normal tissue, a significant SnC burden was 
observed in both DR/DME and AMD globes. 
The Sponsor hypothesizes that there is a close relationship between senescence burden, 
measured by p16 IHC in the retina, the presence of SASP in the tissue, and clinical progression 
in patients with DR and DME. UBX1325 has the potential to remove SnCs from a tissue without 
altering the healthy resident cells in the eye and slow down the progression of the disease or 
even provide structural and functional recovery by [CONTACT_516327], but a set of proinflammatory or growth factors present in the SASP. This approach would 
address more effectively the multifactorial character of the disease and may decrease the 
proportion of patients that respond either poorly or partially to anti-VEGF, the need for repeated 
treatments, and the long-term complications like fibrosis and macular atrophy. 
2.4.[ADDRESS_669226] been detected in the vitreous humor and 
aqueous humor from patients with ocular disease. Levels of mediators such as VEGF, tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF), IL--derived growth factor (PDGF), and IL-[ADDRESS_669227] and AMD globes ( Bromberg-White et al., 2013 ; 
Boss et al., 2017; Ghodasra et al., 2016 ; Sato et al., 2018 ). In addition to p16, the Sponsor is 
focused on the association of disease-relevant SASP to our senescent cellular and in vivo 
animal models. Elimination of SnCs by [CONTACT_516315]1325 may lead to a reduction in SASP by [CONTACT_516328], resulting in the restoration of homeostasis and retinal function. 
Human ocular cell types can be cultured and rendered senescent by a variety of different 
insults, including DNA-damaging treatment (e.g., irradiation) and disease relevant- conditions 
such as incubation in elevated glucose media. Human retinal microvascular endothelial cells 
(HRMEC) upregulate the production of important mediators such as VEGF and PDGF upon 
induction of senescence by [CONTACT_52004] ( Figure 3 ). As these molecules have been shown to be 
elevated in DR patients (G hodasra et al., 2016;  Klaassen et al., 2017 ), it stands to reason that 
senescent HRMEC in the retinas of patients may be the source of the elevated VEGF/PDGF 
that contribute to disease pathogenesis. 
Clinical Study Protocol UBX1325
UBX1325-[ADDRESS_669228] = diabetic retinopathy; HRMEC = human retinal microvascular endothelial cells; mRNA = messenger ribonucleic 
acid; NSnC = non-senescent cells; SnC = senescent cells; PDGF = platelet-derived growth factor; p16 = p16 cellular 
biomarker; p21 = p21 cellular biomarker; VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor. 
Increased expression of several genes was observed by [CONTACT_16641]-PCR in non-senescent HRMEC (NsnC) or HRMEC 
treated with elevated glucose (200 mM) in culture media for [ADDRESS_669229] and accumulate in tissues ( Yosef et al., 2016 ). Binding 
of retinal Bcl-xL by [CONTACT_516315]0601 in senescent HRMEC acts to promote caspase activation and the 
apoptotic cascade, ultimately leading to cell death (manuscript in preparation). 
In streptozotocin-induced DR mouse model, IVT administration of UBX1325 resulted in 
decreased vascular leakage at all doses tested (2 to 200 pmol) ( Figure 4 ). Similarly, IVT 
administration of UBX1325 in the mouse OIR model resulted in decreased neovascularization
(Figure 4 ). Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for additional details.

A) Increased retinal vascular leakage was measured by [CONTACT_516329] (Vehicle) as 
compared to non-diabetic animals. All 3 dose levels of UBX1325 (2-200 pmol, IVT) significantly reduced vascular 
leakage. B) Neovascular area was determined from isolectin B4-stained images of OIR retinas. All 4 dose levels of 
UBX1325 (3-100 pmol, IVT) significantly reduced retinal neovascularization as compared to vehicle control animals.
2.4.4 Supportive Nonclinical Data
All nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicology, studies briefly described in 
this section were conducted by [CONTACT_516330]. More detailed information is provided in the 
current version of the IB.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacology
UBX1325 (pro-drug) and UBX0601 (active parent molecule), where appropriate, were studied in 
cellular and animal models of ocular disease to demonstrate activity in the retina. UBX1325 is a 
potent inhibitor of Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulatory proteins, which results in initiation of 
apoptosis in HRMEC, in vitro. In 2 different mouse models of retinal dysfunction, UBX1325 
demonstrated inhibition of disease-relevant endpoints such as neovascularization (NV) and 
vascular leakage. UBX1325 is a  pro-drug of UBX0601, which is cleaved rapi[INVESTIGATOR_516301] a 
ubiquitously present enzyme, phosphatase.

Ocular tissue exposures of UBX1325 and UBX0601 following a single IVT injection of [ADDRESS_669230]-dose. UBX0601 half-lives in the vitreous humor, retina, choroid, and iris-ciliary 
body of rabbits were 48 hours, 34 hours, 47 hours, and 80 hours, respectively. The 
concentration of UBX0601 in the lens showed a slower rate of decline with an estimated half-life 
of 173 hours. Aqueous humor concentrations, which did not allow for PK estimates, appeared to

study, there were no effects on QTc. This result was consistent with UBX1325 and UBX0601 
not having clinically relevant effects on the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel. 
The combination of UBX1325 with aflibercept was well tolerated with no effects on IOP, ERGs, the cynomolgus monkey. There was no apparen

a 2-week interval with no apparent signs of toxicity.  
Intravitreal administration of UBX1325 (on Study Day 15) in combination with aflibercept (on 
Study Days 1 and 29), was well tolerated. There was no 
or aflibercept-related clinical observations or changes in food consumption or body weight; no

UNITY Biotechnology, Inc. 35 Confidential profile supporting further development. As of November 9, 2021 there were a total of 14 adverse 
events unrelated to study drug. Of those 14, 4 were non-ocular, non-serious, non-drug related 
adverse events in 2 wet AMD patients (1 patient contracted COVID-19 and 1 patient had a tooth 
extraction, blister on gums and constipation). The remaining 10 ocular, non-serious, non-drug 
related adverse events occurred in 9 patients (2 DME and 7 wet AMD). Nine were study eye 
related (progression of disease in 8 patients, 1 DME and 7 wet AMD) and 1 was non-study eye 
related (retinal detachment in 1 DME patient). There were no serious adverse events, 
dose-limiting toxicities, inflammation, or AEs that would preclude advancement into later-stage 
clinical development. 
The Sponsor is aware of the systemic toxicities associated with venetoclax, an -approved 
oral Bcl-2 selective 
acute myeloid leukemia. As a consequence of being in the same class of molecules, and in view 
of similar systemic toxicities noted in UBX1325 IV nonclinical studies, the Sponsor is planning to 
monitor for potential Bcl-2 inhibitor related toxicities (e.g., cytopenia) that may emerge from 
UBX1325 IVT treatment ( Section 8 ). However, based on currently available exposure data from 
nonclinical studies following IVT dosing ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and the lack of measurable systemic 
exposure of UBX1325 and UBX0601 after a single IVT dose at all doses tested in patients in the 
Phase 1 SAD study, the Sponsor expects systemic exposure of UBX1325 following IVT 
treatment to be low in patients and, therefore, the potential to observe such systemic events is 
also low.

Version 4.0 
UNITY Biotechnology, Inc. 38 Confidential 4 STUDY PLAN 
4.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled study 
to assess the safety, tolerability and evidence of activity of repeat IVT injections of UBX1325 in 
patients with wet AMD. Approximately 46 patients will be enrolled 1:1 to the repeat doses of 
UBX1325 or active-controlled (aflibercept) study arms, in order to assess the primary objective. 
All patients will be followed for approximately 48 weeks. 
See Section 7.8 for details on double-masking and site requirements. A schematic 
representation of the study design is presented in  1. 
4.2 Design Rationale 
4.2.1 Patient Population Selection 
Based on the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology and toxicology data (refer to the UBX1325 IB) 
and scientific rationale (see Section 2.4 ), the Sponsor asserts that UBX1325 can be tested for 
safety, tolerability and evidence of activity in wet AMD patients. 
Patients will be those who are 50 years of age or older and diagnosed as having wet AMD with 
BCVA in the SE of 70 to 20 40 on the Snellen chart). 
4.2.2 Dose Rationale 
As of November 9, 2021, in patients with advanced DME and wet AMD in the SAD Phase 1 
study, UBX1325 was well tolerated with favorable acute safety profile supporting development; 
no dose-limiting toxicities in any of the dose cohorts, including the high do The 
 
In terms of mechanism of action, of the drug and based on preclinical models, a single injection 
of UBX1325 is proposed to induce the selective elimination of SnCs. However, it is conceivable 
that a single injection is insufficient in eliminating all SnCs in the tissue, therefore elimination of 
additional SnCs with a repeat dose of UBX1325 can potentially be clinically beneficial. 
om choroidal vasculature is affected, optimum efficacy and 
durability may require a repeat dose so this Phase 2 aims to determine if the repeat will be 
clinically beneficial.

UNITY Biotechnology, Inc. 57 Confidential Patients randomized to the aflibercept arm will receive aflibercept on Day 1, Weeks 8, 16, 24, 
32, 40 and sham procedure on Weeks 4 and 28. Coadministration of UBX1325 with aflibercept 
will occur at Weeks 24 and 32. 
Patients will be randomly allocated to receive treatment through the randomization system, 
which administers the randomization code generated by [CONTACT_1034]’s biostatistician or 
designee. Following receipt of the treatment assignment, the site staff will prepare the Study 
Drug as instructed by [CONTACT_516335]. Patients who are randomized but do not receive 
treatment may be replaced. 
7.3 Randomization Code Creation and Storage 
Randomization personnel of the Sponsor or designee will generate the randomization schedule 
prior to the start of the study. An interactive web response system will be used for patient 
randomization. All randomization information will be stored in a secured area, accessible only by 
[CONTACT_4144]. 
7.4 Administration of UBX1325 
UBX1325 is administered via IVT injection. Following the IVT injection, patients will be 
monitored for elevation of IOP, decreased optic nerve head perfusion, and for possible injection 
complications (e.g., vitreous hemorrhage, retinal tears, etc.). Additionally, patients should 
immediately report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, such as ocular pain, swelling, 
redness, haze and gradual loss of vision. 
Patients may be prescribed prophylactic antibiotic eye drops following any IVT injection or sham 
procedure per the site’s preferred practice patterns. Such drops, if prescribed, should be 
documented in the patient’s eCRF. 
Sites are to use numbing agents per their preferred practice and documented in the patient’s 
eCRF. Use of numbing agents should be consistent for IVT injections and sham procedures. 
7.5 Administration of Sham Procedure 
Sham procedures will be performed to maintain double-masking on the study. A sham 
procedure involves a needleless, empty sterile syringe that touches the surface of the SE to 
mimic an IVT injection. The unmasked team will administer IVT injections or sham procedures 
according the patient’s randomization status and per Study Schematic in Figure 1. Please refer 
to the current Pharmacy Manual for details on how to prepare and administer the sham 
procedure.

At each visit, patients will undergo ophthalmologic evaluation and assessment for signs of 
potential toxicity. 
For all patients, all acquired data may be reviewed by [CONTACT_183307]. This process will be detailed in 
the SAC Charter. 
8.1 Definitions 
AE: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an
intervention in humans whether or not it is considered intervention related.
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R): A serious adverse
reaction (AR) that is unexpected based on current product information.
Serious adverse event (SAE): An event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either
the Investigator or the Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
-Death
-A life-threatening AE (An event is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of
death. It does not include an AE or suspected AR that, had it occurred in a more
severe form, might have caused death.)-Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
-A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct
normal life functions-A congenital anomaly/birth defect
-Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Causality or relatedness : AEs should be considered probably or possibly
treatment-related, unless they fulfill the following criteria (in which circumstances it
should be considered unlikely related or unrelated):
-Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the Study Drug (e.g.,
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant
medication), and/or
-The AE has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the Study Drug
(e.g., a new cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_669258] dose of Study Drug).
Relatedness to Study Drug will be graded as “probably,” “possibly,” “unlikely,” or “unrelated” 
as follows: 
Clinical Study Protocol UBX1325
UBX1325-03 
Version 4.0 
UNITY Biotechnology, Inc. 61 Confidential Probably related: The AE 
-Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration
-Abates upon discontinuation of the drug
-Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical
state
Possibly related: The AE 
-Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration
-Could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_516338]: The AE 
-Is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_516339]: The AE 
-Does not follow a reasonable sequence from drug administration
-Is readily explained by [CONTACT_516340]’s clinical state, concurrent medical conditions, or by [CONTACT_516341]: An AR is any AE caused by a drug.
Suspected adverse reaction  (SAR): An SAR is any AE for which there is a reasonable
possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of the investigational new drug
(IND) safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a
causal relationship between the drug  and the AE. SAR implies a lesser degree of
certainty about causality than AR.
Unexpected : An event is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the IB, is not listed at
the specificity or severity that has been observed, or, if an IB is not required or available,
is not consistent with the risk information described in the General Investigational Plan or
elsewhere in the IND. Unexpected also refers to events that are mentioned in the IB as
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of
the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under
investigation.
Severity or intensity:  The severity of an event describes the degree of impact upon the
patient and/or the need for medical care necessary to treat the event. AEs reported for
patients participating in this study will be graded using the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE v4.03). The
Investigator will grade the severity of each AE using, when applicable, the NCI CTCAE
v4.03. For AEs not included in the NCI CTCAE v4.03, the criteria outlined in Table 2
should be used as a general guideline.

8.2 Documenting Adverse Events 
8.2.1 Timeframe for Collection 
AEs and SAEs will be collected from Screening (with the aflibercept run-in, prior to aflibercept 
should be collected as medical history) through the last follow-up visit at Visit 14, Week 48, or 
ET. All events prior to this will be documented as medical history. TEAEs will be collected from 
Visit [ADDRESS_669259] follow up on all AEs through Week 48/ET. Nonserious AEs may be 
followed to resolution past the patient’s last study visit at the discretion of the Investigator and/or 
Medical Monitor if in the best interest of the patient and the assessment of safety of UBX1325. 
The Investigator must follow up on all SAEs until the events have subsided, returned to 
baseline, or, in case of permanent impairment, the condition stabilizes. 
8.2.2 Classification of Events 
Although AEs should be based on the signs or symptoms detected during the physical 
examination and on the clinical evaluation of the patient, a specific diagnosis should be reported 
as the AE whenever feasible. In addition to the information obtained from those sources, the 
patient should be asked the following nonspecific question: “How have you been feeling since 
your last visit?” Signs and symptoms should be recorded using standard medical terminology.

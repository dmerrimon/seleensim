Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684235]:  
For the majority of women with breast cancer (BrCA), radiation therapy (XRT) is critical for preventing 
local recurrence and improving breast preservation and  survival. [1]  XRT to the whole breast is a 
necessary component of breast conserving therapy and is standard of care following partial 
mastectomy; XRT has been shown t o decrease locoregional recurrence by 2/3 and improve absolute 
survival by a minimum of 5% over lumpectomy alone. [1]   
 
As the number of survivors has markedly increased, clinicians are now seeking to reduce treatmen t-
related toxicities and inconveniences of treatment, namely the traditional [ADDRESS_926978] common acute and 
potentially long -term debilitating toxicities of BrCA XRT. [2, 3]  During XRT, approximately 50% of 
patients develop significant cutaneous toxicity  including moist skin desquamation, erythema, and 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. [2, 3]   
 
Two recent studies have examined the role of hypofractionation (>2Gy per day with shorter overall 
treatment time) in the treatment of breast cancer. [4, 5]  A recently published Phase III Canadian study 
randomi zed early stage BrCA patients to 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions (fxns) (2.66 Gy per day) or 50 Gy in 
25 fxns (2 Gy per day) to the whole breast following lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. 
[4] At 10 years, there was no difference in local control, survival, or cutaneous toxicity. [4]  The [LOCATION_006] 
START B study also randomized patien ts to 40 Gy in 15 fxns (2.66 Gy per day) or 50 Gy in 25 
fractions (2 Gy per day) and found no difference in local control, survival, or cosmesis at 5 years. [5]  
Both studies successfully challenged the long held radiobiological belief that large daily fractions (>2 
Gy per day) portends severe late normal tissue toxicity and unacceptable breast cosmesis following 
XRT.   More recently, an updated analysis  of the [LOCATION_006] START trial was presented with 9.[ADDRESS_926979] five weeks of XRT treatment. [6] 
 
Howeve r, both the Canadian and [LOCATION_006] studies included patient populations at relatively low risk of 
XRT-induced toxicity. [4, 5]  Race, prior chemotherapy treatment, body habitus, and age have all been 
correlated with a patient’s radiotherapy tolerance.  More than 70% of participants in both 
hypofractionation studies were Caucasian and over the age of 50; fewer than 25% of patients 
received chemotherapy. [4, 5]  It is known that African American women with BrCA experience more 
severe XRT -induced side effects than Caucasians, possibly contributing in part to poorer treatment 
adherence and worse outcome. [7-9] During and after XRT, African -Americans have worse cutaneous 
toxicity (edema, f ibrosis, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_371]) than Caucasians (45% versus 10%, respectively).   In 
addition, overall cosmesis, reflective of radiation -induced cutaneous toxicity, was good to excellent in 
90% of Caucasians versus only 55% of African Americans following breast  conserving treatment with 
XRT. [8]  Negative perceptions of BrCA treatment including XRT may part ially explain poor treatment 
 
12/13/2016  
 adherence rates in the African American community.  Indeed, at our own institution, 26% of AAs with 
BrCA refused XRT in a recent study. [10]  In addition to race, several studies have also found that 
patients heavily pre -treated with chemotherapy experience at least twice as much XRT induced skin 
desquamation and edema. [11-13]  Moreover, women with larger breasts have higher rates of 
cutaneous toxicity due to the buildup of dose on the surface of the skin as the radiation beam tries to 
penetrate a large depth of tissue.  For this reason, the Canadian stud y limited their enrollment to 
those women with less than 25cm of separation of the breast (the largest distance between the entry 
and exit point of the XRT beam on the breast). [4]   Lastly, women less than age [ADDRESS_926980] poorer cosmesis than older women following surgery and XR T.[7]  Given the patient 
population treated in both the Canadian and  [LOCATION_006] studies, it is unclear if a shortened XRT regimen may 
be applied to a “high risk” patient (e.g. young patients previously treated with chemotherapy).    
 
Furthermore, in the [LOCATION_006] START study, post mastectomy patients were included as well as patients 
requiring regional nodal irradiation  although only 15% of the enrolled patients were post -mastectomy 
patients  and only 15% of the entire cohort needed regional nodal irradiation.  Therefore, these 
patients at relatively higher risk for lymphedema/brachial pl exopathy from XRT were under -
represented in the [LOCATION_006] START study .  However, among the small number of patients treated with 
hypofractionated XRT to the regional lymph nodes (supraclavicular radiaton), there were no 
significant increases in lymphedema or brac hial plexopathy compared to women treated with 
standard 5 weeks of XRT to the supraclavicular fossa. [6]     
  
Additionally, a now standard boost dose to the lumpectomy cavity  or chest  wall, proven to significantly 
improve local control by 10% or greater in women less  than 50 years of age [14-16], was not required 
in either arm of the Canadian or [LOCATION_006] study. [4, 5]    The boost dose has been shown to improve 
locoregional control in all patients by a minimum of 3% but appears to have the greatest impact in 
younger patients. [14-16]  This boost dose has extended conventional XRT treatment from 5 (50 Gy in 
25 fxns) to 6 weeks (60 Gy in 30 fxns) in the majority of patients treated within the [LOCATION_002].       
 
At our institution, we have one of the largest experiences with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) 
technique in patients with BrCA; we deliver [ADDRESS_926981] while treating the 
cavity  simultaneously to a higher dose of 59.92 Gy in 25 fxns. Our published experience shows that 
at 3 years, our 5 -week regimen is generally well tolerated with <1% of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_14478] 3 
cutaneous toxicity and only 2.8% of patients recurring locally. [17]  Our results are particularly 
important given that 39% of these patients were AA,  33% were p remenopausal, 30% had breast 
separation >25cm, and 45% received chemotherapy, all factors associated with heightened skin 
toxicity from XRT. [17]     
 
Seeking to shorten the treatment course further and improve convenience and treatment adherence, 
we propose to build upon our experience and the level I evidence advocating for hypofractionation in 
[ADDRESS_926982] treated to 
40.5 Gy in 15 fractions, while the cavity is treated to 48 Gy.(20) At 1 year median follow -up time, 67% 
of patients had developed reversible grade 1 -2 skin dermatitis and only 1 of 91 patients had recurred 
locor egionally.(20) However, only 1/[ADDRESS_926983] size.  The majority of patients were over the age of 50 and 87% were Caucasian.(20)  No 
study has examined the feasibility of a 15 -day hypofractiona ted SIB XRT regimen in women at high 
risk for cutaneous toxicity (e.g. women below the age of 50, African American, and/or treated with 
chemotherapy). The unique patient population served by [CONTACT_684240] a study of SIB XRT given 
 
12/13/2016  
 over 15 treatments.  Q uality of life measures (e.g. Multidimensional Fatigue inventory (MFI) [18], the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_160976] (PSQI) [19], the perceived stress scale (PSS) [20], the Inventory of 
Depressive Symptomalogy -Self Reported (IDS -SR)[21], the Short -Form Health Survey (SF -36)(25 ) 
and the Godin Leisure Time Questionnaire (GLTEQ)(26) ) which have been validated in multiple 
populations, will also be assessed in these patients to determine if 15 days of treatment is feasible.   
 
Preliminary Data:  
Recent work from our group indicates that ultrasound tissue characterization (UTC) may objectively 
and reliably measure XRT -induced cutaneous toxicity in BrCA patients. UTC is a non -invasive 
technique de veloped by [CONTACT_684241], PH.D.(co -Investigator ), to delineate sub -resolution tissue features 
that are not visible by [CONTACT_38183] B -mode ultrasonography. [22, 23]   From the UTC analysis, we can 
obtain quantitative parameters (skin thickness, Pearson coefficient, and midband fit value) 
characterizing the dermal, hypodermal, and subcutaneou s tissue. These spectral parameters are 
related to structural tissue properties including skin thickening, fibrosis, and edema. [22, 23] In 
published work, the clinical assessments of XRT -induced skin toxicity correlate strongly with UTC 
measurements and objectively validate this measurement of skin toxicity. [23]  However, inter -
observer subjective toxicity assessments have mild to moderate agreement.  UTC would provide a 
reproducible way of characterizing toxicity.  XRT -induced skin thickening increases with maximum 
thickness occurring at the completion of XRT. T he thickening decreases significantly by [ADDRESS_926984] 
XRT in patients treated with a traditional 6 week course of XRT. We plan to use UTC to objectively 
quantify cutaneous toxicity during XRT in this study. Time points for analysis of cutaneous toxicity 
(baseline, fraction 15  of XRT and 2 - 5 weeks , 7 - 12 weeks , and 12 – [ADDRESS_926985] XRT) are 
based on these data. [23].  
 
Study Design:  
 
Eighty  breast cancer patients with Stage [ADDRESS_926986]  wall with or without regional nodal 
radiotherapy:  
 
1.  Prior Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer  
2.  >[ADDRESS_926987] separation (the largest distance on an axial slice of the planning CT simulation 
scan between the entry and exit points of the radiation beam on th e body)  
3.  Non-Caucasian  Race  
4.  < [ADDRESS_926988] been correlated with heightened levels of skin 
toxicity and/or were under -represented in previous trials of hypofractionated XRT , any patient fulfilling 
one of the above criteria, will be approached for enrollment in the study.  
 
Males will be excluded.  
 
   
To protect against possible side effects of radiation, women who are pregnant  or nursing a child may 
not take part in this study.    
 
12/13/[ADDRESS_926989] treatments according to ICRU Guidelines. (19)   
  
Treatment plans must be generated with heterogeneity corrections turned on.  
 
Eligible patients are those being treated after lumpectomy  or mastectomy .   
 
  
Whole Breast or chest  wall Treatment:  
The whole breast  or chest  wall will be treated with tangents (modulated with either wedges  or field -n-
field technique) to a dose of 2.[ADDRESS_926990] 95% of the prescribed dose.   The whole breast  
or chest  wall should receive less than 1 15%.  No more than 8% of the whole breast should receive 
<95% of the prescribed dose.  
 
5mm bolus may be used on the chest  wall in postmastectomy patients at the discretion of the treating 
physician.    
  
Central lung distance <2.5cm from chest  wall to posterior edge of  tangents  
Maximum heart distance <1.5cm  from chest  wall to posterior edge o f  tangents  
  
 
Regional Nodal / Supraclavicular  Irradiation : 
For patients requiring regional nodal irradiation, the physician will determine which lymph nodes are 
at risk and these targeted lymph nodes will be contoured ( e.g. level I, II, III, and/or supraclavicular 
nodes and/or internal mammary lymph nodes).   
 
The lymph nodes will be prescribed 2.[ADDRESS_926991] 90 % of the prescribed dose.  The targeted regional lymph no des should receive less than 105 % 
of the prescribed dose. If these dose constraint s cannot be met, the treating physician has the option 
of decreasing the total d ose to the targeted lymph nodes per day to 2.[ADDRESS_926992] to the Cavity Treatment:  
  
The boost treatment will be given on the same days as the whole breast treatment.  
 
12/13/2016  
 The lumpectomy cavity + scar (in lumpectomy patients) or chest  wall scar (mastectomy patients)  will 
receive 0.54 Gy per day x 15 fractions .   
 
95% of the tumor bed volume should receive at least 95% of the prescribed dose.    
  
Effort should be made to reduce treatment volume receiving more than 1 15% of the boost dose to 
less than 1%.    
  
Electrons or photons may be used for the boost fields.  It is up to the clinician to decide and will often 
be decided based upon the depth of the cavity.   
 
If using photons (mini -tangents), for deep cavities, margi n is 1.5cm on cavity + scar  to field  
                               edge  
 
Suggested photon fields for the boost are to use the same gantry angles from the initial whole breast 
fields with the same couch kick as the whole breast tangents.  If the cavity i s laterally located, kick the 
couch on the lateral tangent  for a 3rd field [ADDRESS_926993]  wall, margin is 2.0 cm on cavity + scar  to 
block edge in all dimensions  but posterior to   the cavity volume  in the case of breast conserving 
surgery patients.   
 
 
 
***Please note that if using electrons to boost the cavity  or chest  wall, this must be done on a 
non-breathold  scan even when using breathold for whole breast tangent treatment for left 
sided tumors.    
In addition to the port films, a  cone beam CT scan will be done  1-[ADDRESS_926994] -mastectomy patients.   
 
Dose Constraints to Normal Tissues:  
 
Heart:  
Maximum heart distance <1.5cm  on tangents or mean dose < [ADDRESS_926995] be less than or equal to 10%.  (V13Gy<10%)  
 
 
Lung:  
Central lung distance <2.5cm on tangen ts orthe ipsilateral  lung volume receiving [ADDRESS_926996] be less 
than or equal to 15%.   (V18Gy<15%), the contralateral  lung volume receiving 2.[ADDRESS_926997] be less than 
or equal to 15%.  (V2.5Gy<15%), or Total Lung V20 <36%  
 
Contralateral breast dose:  
 
12/13/[ADDRESS_926998] be < or equal to 3 Gy  but aim should be less than 1 Gy  
 
Data Collection:   
 
Cutaneous toxicity will be assessed at baseline, fraction 15 of XRT and 2 - 5 weeks, 7 - 12 weeks, 
and 12 – [ADDRESS_926999] XRT by [CONTACT_684242] (UTC).  Photographs of the 
treated breast  or chest  wall as well as the contralateral breast  will also be taken . Documentation of 
the UTC and photographs will be kept in electronic format  for reference .  For each  visit after the 
baseline  (after treatment has begun) , cutaneous toxicity will be assessed by a clinician .  Participants 
will be seen by [CONTACT_684243]/or fourth visits and at the fifth visit and an 
investigator dictation will be performed.  
 
Patients who have had a mastectomy and plan for permanent br east reconstructive surgery after 
radiation will be assessed within one month of their permanent reconstructive surgery and 5 – 7 
months following their surgery using the same procedures as described above. It is highly variable as 
to when reconstruction w ill occur. If these time points do not fall within the time frame for the regular 
study visits, additional study visits will be added for these patients.  
 
Participants will also be asked to complete the Multidimensional Fatigue inventory (MFI) [18], the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_160976] (PSQI) [19], the perceived stress scale (PSS) [20],  the Inventory of 
Depressive Symptomalogy -Self Reported (IDS -SR)[21], the PROMIS Fatigue Short form [28],  the 
MOS -item Short -Form health survey (SF -36)(25) and the Godin Leisure -Time Exercise Questionnaire 
(GLTEQ)(26)  to assess levels of fatigue, sleep, stress, and depression at the above time points.  
These  surveys take approximately [ADDRESS_927000] Cancer Patients Undergoing Treatment (IRB00028295) may have survey 
visit assessments completed prior to baseline visit, as they are completing the same assessments for 
both studies. These s urveys will be used for data purposes in lieu of having the patient complete the 
same paperwork twice.   At each visit, patients will be asked to rate their fatigue level and breast pain 
on a scale of [ADDRESS_927001],on a scale of 0 – 10, 
0 being no differen ce and 10 being completely different.   The patient’s self -report of fatigue at these 
visits will be used to assess the grade of their fatigue.  In addition, patients will complete the  LENT 
SOMA [27] scale patient questionnaire at all study timepoints to a ddress pain within the breast.  The 
objective LENT SOMA questionnaire Part 3 will be completed by a study  clinician or trained nurse at 
each visit after baseline.    
 
Blood will be drawn under fasting conditions  at visits corresponding to cutaneous toxicity  
assessments.  The blood will be analyzed for inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -
alpha, soluble TNF receptor 2 (sTNFR2), interleukin (IL) -6, IL-1ra, and C - reactive  protein (CRP) as 
well as genetic factors to determine if they are associated with development of cutaneous toxicity.   
 
Information regarding disease characteristics (including stage, tumor size, grade), patient 
demographics (including age, race, co -morbidities, social history , body mass index ), systemic 
treatment (including hormone therapy, systemic therapy), surgical treatment, radiation treatment, and 
clinical outcomes (local control, distant metastasis, survival, and treatment complications) will be 
collected and recorded.  
 
12/13/2016  
  
 
Patients may also be asked to participate in a long term assessment between 1 and 10  years where 
they will complete the same study procedures as outlined above.  Patients will be compensated 
$50.[ADDRESS_927002] cancer 
and if so, the date they started.   We will obtain verbal consent for this survey from patients who 
completed this study before the follow up phone surve y was originally approved on 9/24/2013.   
 
 
Assuming 10% of patients dropout, [ADDRESS_927003] only radiation will be enrolled (2 -3 
patients per month) to yield a total of [ADDRESS_927004]  wall radiation will be 
enrolled. Assuming 10% of patients dropout, 33 patients of these patients will be enrolled (2 -3 
patients per month) to yield a total of [ADDRESS_927005] wall radiation.  
 
In patients undergoing regional nodal irradiation, arm measurements will be taken of the ipsilateral 
and contralateral upper extremity at baseline , 7 - 12 weeks, and 12 – [ADDRESS_927006] .  These 
patients will also be assessed for brachial plexopathy using RTOG grading toxicity, LENT/SOMA 
grading toxicity, and a modified version of a validated questionnaire to assess symptoms of brachial 
plexopathy at baseline and 7 - 12 weeks, and 12 – [ADDRESS_927007] XRT. [24]  If a patient develops 
RTOG or LENT/SOMA Grade 3 toxicity, an objective measurement (MRI and/or nerve conduction 
studies) of brachial plexopat hy will be employed.

Monitoring Plan for Severe Adverse Events:   
We hypothesize that a maximum of 20% of patients might experience severe acute skin side effects 
defined as NCI -CTC Grade 3.  This corresponds to symptoms interfering with activities of daily life.  A 
Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor pa tient outcomes and suspend the protocol in 
the event that more than 16 of 80 patients demonstrate severe acute skin toxicity.  During the study, 
the patients will be monitored continuously throughout the study such that if at any time during the 
study the upper limit of the number of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_14478] 3 toxicity exceed what is listed in the 
table below, the trial will be discontinued.  With a 10% dropout rate, a total sample size of [ADDRESS_927013] of toxicity at each visit by [CONTACT_684247]

Patients Requiring Regional Nodal Irradiation  
Among patients requiring regional nodal irradiation, w e hypothesize that <3 .0% of patients will 
develop severe brachial plexopathy following radiation to the regional nodes defined as 
LENT/SOMA or RTOG  Grade 3 or higher (Continuous paresthesias  with incomplete motor 
paresis; pain medicat ion is generally required or objective neurologic findings with paresthesia 
or paresis)  As this toxicity occurs after radiation treatment is complete, patients will be formally 
assessed for brachial plexopathy at baseline and  at 7-[ADDRESS_927014]. Torres if symptoms of brachial plexopathy develop in between or after study visits.  
We also hypothesize  that less than 15% of patients receiving regional nodal irradiation will 
develop 20% or greater increase in arm lymphedema (compared to baseline measurements) 
assessed at 7-[ADDRESS_927015] radiation .   Of note, lymphedema that 
develops in t he context of weight gain (>/=15% increase in weight) or trauma to the arm will 
not be attributed to the radiation treatment  itself and will not be considered an event to due to 
the treatment.  If this side effect is secondary to radiation rather than surg ery, it generally 
occurs after radiation is complete.   Lymphedema that takes place during the 3 weeks of 
radiation or before radiation begins will be attributed to surgery.  During the study, the patients

Correlative Studies :  Blood will be analyzed for inflammatory markers (TNF -alpha, soluble  sTNFR2, 
IL-6, IL-1ra, and CRP) to determine if they are associated with development of cutaneous toxicity.  By 
[CONTACT_684249] 5  time points, the development and resolution of 
cutaneous toxicity as it relates to time may be further understood.   
A description of the Feasibility:  
There is no drug in the proposed study.  Our department has [ADDRESS_927018] radiotherapy.  As determined by 2000 census, the 
majority of minorities in our community are African American, and Afri can Americans make up 61.4% 
of the population of metropolitan Atlanta.  A study including this population would be feasible.  At the 
three Emory radiation centers, there are approximately [ADDRESS_927019] cancer with Stage 
0-II patients treated annually at Emory Clifton Campus, Emory Midtown, and Grady Memorial 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  In a recent study, over 60% of our patients had breast separation >25cm. [17]  This trial 
should be able to accrue 33 high risk patients (2 to 3 patients per month, and assumi ng a 10% 
dropout rate) needed to assess the feasibility of this novel hypofractionated simultaneous integrated 
boost (SIB) regimen.  
[CONTACT_684251] (co -PI) is an NIH funded physicist with expertise in ultrasound tissue characterization 
(UTC) of radiation ind uced cutaneous toxicity.  [CONTACT_32830]’s Ultrasonic Imaging Laboratory is fully 
equipped with three clinical ultrasound machines including a state -of-the art Sonix RP scanner with 
raw radiofrequency echo signals and advanced research interface.  The laboratory is located on the 
tunnel level within the Department of Radiation Oncology.  It comprises [ADDRESS_927020]. Liu’s eq uipment and software.  Measurements of breast tissue take 
about [ADDRESS_927021]. Andrew Miller, Professor of Psychiatry and an international expert on inflammatory induced 
behavioral changes.  He has agreed to help process the blood from this study.   
       Potential risks:   
                             The risk to patients is minimal. Blood draws will be performed at a maximum of 
eight different time points during the course of their treatment and follow -up.   
You may feel slight discom fort from the blood draws at the site of the needle 
stick.  Slight swelling and bruising are fairly common but usually go away soon.  
Rarely, people may have a vasovagal syncope.  
Vasovagal syncope (vay -zoh-VAY-gul SING -kuh-pee) occurs when you faint 
because your body overreacts to certain triggers, such as the sight of blood or 
extreme emotional distress. It may also be called neurocardiogenic syncope.  
 
12/13/2016  
 The vasovagal syncope trigger causes your heart rate and blood pressure to 
drop suddenly. That leads to reduced blood flow to your brain, causing you to 
briefly lose consciousness.  
Vasovagal syncope is usually harmless and requires no treatment. But it's 
possible you may injure yourself during a vasovagal syncope epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Your  
doctor may recommend tests to rule out more serious causes of fainting, such as 
heart disorders.  
 
 All patients will be assigned a study number, and this number will be used in 
place of patient’s names or identification numbers so there should be minimal 
risk of loss of patient confidentiality.  The master sheet containing the patient 
number and study ID will be kept in a password protected database.   
      Compensation:  
Women who complete the long term assessment  will be compensated $50.00 for that study  
visit.

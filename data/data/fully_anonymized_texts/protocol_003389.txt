 Title: Evaluating values -based motivational interviewing to increase treatment completion 
with fixed dose combination MK -5172/MK -8742 among Veterans with active substance 
use disorders and treatment -naïve genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C  
Investigators: Mary Jane Burton, M.D., Andrew C Voluse, PhD.,  
1. Objective and hypotheses.  
 
Primary Objective: Implement a values -based motivational interviewing (VBMI) 
intervention to promote treatment completion with fixed dose combination (FDC) MK -
5172/MK -8742  (elbasvir/grazoprevir, Zepatier ™) x 12 weeks among treatment -naïve 
Veterans with substance use disorder (SUD) and genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) infection.  
 
Primary Hypothesis: Veterans with SUD and genotype 1 chronic HCV infection who r eceive 
the VBMI intervention will complete the full course of treatment in 90% of cases.  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
 
1) Utilize VBMI to promote self -efficacy in taking FDC MK -5172/MK -8742  
(elbasvir/grazoprevir, Zepatier ™)among Veterans with active SUD and chronic HCV 
infection.  
2) Demonstrate the feasibility of FDC MK -5172/MK -8742  (elbasvir/grazoprevir, 
Zepatier ™) for obtaining sustained virologic response  (SVR)  in treatment -naïve genotype 1 
chronic HCV infection among Ve terans with active SUD.  
 
3) Measure the prevalence of baseline NS5a resistance mutations in Veterans with active 
SUD and genotype 1a chronic HCV infection.  NS5a is a nonstructural HCV protein.  
 
Secondary Hypotheses:  
1) Veterans with SUD enrolled in this stud y will demonstrate a trend towards clinically 
significant increases in HCV treatment adherence self -efficacy scores between 
baseline and week 4 of treatment.  
2) FDC MK -5172/MK -8742 (elbasvir/grazoprevir, Zepatier ™)  will be well -tolerated by 
[CONTACT_211774] .  
 
 
2. Study procedures  
2.1Background: The advent of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) for chronic HCV infection has 
increased the tolerability and effectiveness of curative HCV treatment. Disorders which can 
affect adherence to HCV treatment, including SUD, can reduce effectiveness o f DAAs. During 
the pegylated interferon era, the VA HCV 001 study group demonstrated an association 
 
VMBI for SUD/HCV v.  6_10_19 
 between recent alcohol use and early treatment discontinuation, resulting in decreased 
treatment efficacy1. The authors concluded that patients with alcohol  use should be provided 
additional support to assist with treatment completion.  
Motivational interviewing (MI) was initially developed to promote abstinence in those with 
alcohol use disorders2. In recent years, the core of MI techniques has been applied to other 
behavioral areas, including medication adherence3. Prior investigations have determined that 
MI can promote increased medication adherence among patients with HIV infection3-4, but les s 
is known about the effect of MI on adherence to HCV medications. One prior study has 
associated self -efficacy, an idea conceptually linked to MI, with reduced risk of missed HCV 
medication doses5. 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) encourages the pa tient to use mindfulness to 
promote dedication to behavioral change6. The patients accept the difficulties inherent to 
making the change and develop techniques to manage these difficulties. One major component 
of ACT is identifying values that make a life worth living and then mindfully moving towards 
such values. This approach has shown promise with tobacco use disorders7 and has been used 
to promote psychotherapy attendance among substance use disorders8.  
We hypothesize an intervention which uses VBMI wo uld increase rates of HCV treatment 
completion with FDC MK -5172/MK -8742  (elbasvir/grazoprevir, Zepatier ™)among treatment 
naïve Veterans with HCV genotype 1 and SUD.  MK-5172/MK -8742 (elbasvir/grazoprevir, 
Zepatier ™) is a fixed dose combination once daily or al medication for chronic HCV. In clinical 
trials, treatment -naïve patients with genotype 1 HCV who received 12 weeks of MK -5172 and 
MK-8742 had sustained virologic response rates of 98%9. 
Approximately [ADDRESS_253724] a prospective study of 20 Veterans with treatment -naive genotype 1 
chronic hepatitis C infection admitted to the Substance Abuse Residential Rehabilitation 
Treatment Program (SARRTP) and/or diagnosed with SUD with ICD -[ADDRESS_253725] 6 
months. at the G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery VA Medical Center.  Institutional Review Board 
approval will be obtained prior to the conduction of the study.  
 
2.3.1 Study Population  
The G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery VAMC is an urban, academically -affiliated medical center in the 
Southeastern [LOCATION_002].  . The center provides care to approximately 39,[ADDRESS_253726] to follow up.  
The HCV treatment clinics meet 3 ½ days weekly to provide DAA treatment for HCV. 
Veterans with co -existing MH conditions  are frequently seen in clinic , including a ctive SUD. 
Active SUD is not a contraindication for treatment provided the Veteran demonstrates he/she 
can adhere to medications and follow up visits.  Patients with active SUD who begin DAA 
treatment as an outpatient are followed every 2 weeks.

See attached flow chart.      
2.5.1 Participant Recruitment and Enrollment : Veterans with active SUD are regularly screened 
for chronic HCV infection. All patients with chronic HCV are subsequently referred to the HCV 
treatment clinic for treatment evaluation . When evaluating a patient for HCV treatment , 
current diagnoses including SUD (ICD10 CM F10 -F19) are routinely noted.  It is standard of 
care for patients who are infected with HCV genotype 1a  to undergo baseline resistance 
testing before initiation with MK -5172/MK -8742  (elbasvir/grazoprevir, Zepatie r™). Patients 
meeting inclusion criteria will be offered study participation  at their clinic visit . Basic 
demographic data (age -if less than 89 years , race, gender) will be recorded on all patients who 
are asked to participate in the study to allow investigators to asses s for enrollment bias.  
Patients who agree to participate will give their written informed consent. Patients will be 
assigned a unique study number that does not contain personal identifiers after signing 
informed consent. Each patient will have only one number for the duration of the study.  Study 
records will be labeled with this unique study number and will not contain PHI.  Treatment 
will be  prescribed  in accordance with US labeling as described in the package insert.  
Genotype  1b: 12 weeks MK -5172/MK -8742 (elbasvir/grazoprevir, Zepatier ™) 
Genotype 1a without NS5a RAVs: 12 weeks MK -5172/MK -8742 (elbasvir/grazoprevir, 
Zepatier ™) 
Genotype 1a with NS5a RAVS: 16 weeks MK -5172 -MK-8742 (elbasvir/grazoprevir, Zepatier ™) 
with weight based  ribavirin

 2.5.2  Baseline visit : Patients will complete a survey of demographic (age, gender, 
race/ethnicity, income level, marital status, education level, distance from medical center) and 
medical information.  Drug Abuse Screening Test(DAST) and AUDIT will be completed to 
assess severit y of SUD. We will also assess health related quality of life (Rand -36 item Health 
Surv ey [Short Form -36]), social support (Medical Outcomes Study Social Suppor t Survey 
[MOS -SSS] ), depressive symptoms (Patie nt Health Questionnaire [PHQ -9]), and treatment 
adherence self -efficacy (HCV Treatme nt Self Efficacy -A [HCV TSE -A]). 
 
2.5.3. Description of the VBMI intervention  
Patients enrolled will receive [ADDRESS_253727] two sessions values directly (e.g., “My health is important to 
me.”) and indirectly (e.g., “My family is important to me, and I need to be healthy to have time 
for my family.”) related to health behaviors and medication adherence will be elicited.  
Veterans will discuss how well they are living in accordance with their stated values and 
identify  specific goals and objectives for increasing valued living through the use of goal -
setting exercises.  The sessions in Weeks 4, 6, 8, and 10 will predominately be brief “check -in” 
meetings that will focus on helpi[INVESTIGATOR_211770] t o moving towards 
their values. For a more comprehensive description of the intervention, see Appendix F. The 
therapeutic approach of all sessions will be founded in MI techniques and specifically utilize 
the four core processes of engaging  the Veteran to e stablish rapport, focusing  the conversation 
on unhealthy behaviors and/or targets for change, evoking  change -oriented talk and increased 
self-confidence, and planning  specific practical steps for making change. All sessions will be 
conducted by a licensed psychologist who has extensive knowledge in ACT and MI or by a 
trained post -doctoral fellow under the supervision of a licensed psychologist.  The sessions will 
be recorded  (audio only)  for the purposes of monitoring adherence of the psychologist to the 
VBM I protocol.  
 
2.5.4 Description of instruments :  
The Rand -36 item Health Survey (SF -36) is a validated instrument which evaluates physical 
and mental health.  The 36 questions cover 8 domains: physical function, role function as 
limited by [CONTACT_211775], bodily pain, social functioning, mental health, role function as 
limited by [CONTACT_211776], vitality and general health perception. The survey was developed 
by [CONTACT_211777] C.  
 
The Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS -SSS) has also been widely used  
and validated among persons with chronic medical illness, including Veterans with chronic 
hepatitis C. This 19 -item survey assesses the patients’ perceptions of their existin g emotional 
support, tangible support, affectionate support, and social interactions.   
 
The Patient Health Questionnaire(PHQ -9) is a validated survey of depressive symptoms. 
Higher scores indicate a greater likelihood of clinical depression.  This survey is currently used 
to screen for depression annually in Veterans in care at VA Medical Centers.  
 
VMBI for SUD/HCV v.  6_10_19 
  
The HCV -Treatment Self Efficacy (HCV -TSE)  is a standardized survey which assesses self -
belief that a patient can complete his/her treatment regimen of pegylate d interferon and 
ribavirin. The patient rates their confidence in their ability to take medications on a scale of [ADDRESS_253728] adapted 4 questions from 
the original scale regarding medication adherence (HCV -TSE -A) to assess a patient’s 
perceptions of his/her ability to adhere to DAAs.  
 
2.5.5  Follow -up visits : 
The study will last 12 weeks, with follow up visits at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, which will be 
coordinated to occur on the same date as Veterans’ substance abuse aftercare visits. Side 
effects of medications and tolerance of medications will be monitore d at each visit using a 
single question about side effects experienced and response options including the most 
common side effects and a response of “other” and a description of that side effect. A single 
question will also be used to assess for any substa nce use since the last visit, with quantity and 
frequency being recorded if the response is positive.  
Adherence will be assessed at each follow up visit  using the Visual Analog Scale and pi[INVESTIGATOR_10705] . Routine laboratory monitoring will include a CBC, CHEM 14, HCV RNA and a urine 
sample analyzed for cocaine, marijuana, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], and amphetamine use  (all tests are standard 
of care) . The HCV -TSE -A will be repeated at week 4. Assessments of depressive symptoms 
(PHQ -9) and health -related quality of life (SF -36) wi ll be repeated at weeks [ADDRESS_253729] of care for HCV treatment, HCV RNA is measured 12 weeks after treatment 
completion to assess for sustained virologic response  (SVR) . Although there will not be a study 
visit [ADDRESS_253730] udy activities per se, the amount of blood drawn will not exceed 15 cc per visit.  
 
 
2.5.6  Measures of adherence:  
Visual Analog Scale (VAS): VAS is a self -report adherence measurement tool that is well -
validated in HIV populations1. The VAS is a [ADDRESS_253731] name [CONTACT_211779]. The 
interviewer will demonstrate the equivalence of 0%, 50% and 100% adherence on the scale. 
The patient will then mark their level of adherence with each medication over the t wo-week 
interval. The VAS is scored by [CONTACT_211778] 0 and the patient’s 
mark, which is recorded as % adherence. This % will be recorded at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 
12 for FDC MK-5172/MK -874 2(elbasvir/grazoprevir, Zepatier ) .  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_38950]: The number of each dispensed medications will be recorded at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 
and 10. Patients will bring their pi[INVESTIGATOR_211771]. Adherence will be calculated as:  
%  Adh erence  = number dispensed -  number remaining          x 100  
 
VMBI for SUD/HCV v.  6_10_19 
                                 Number dispensed  
 
 
3. Data Management : 
Patients will be assigned a unique study number  which does not contain PHI . This number will 
be used on all data collected for the purposes of this study. A master list of subjects which links 
the study number and patient identifiers will be maintained on a n encrypted VA server.  The 
data for this study will be entered into Microso ft Excel 2010. The investigator(s) and their 
research personnel are responsible for maintaining the study database, which will be kept on 
an encrypted VA server.  No data will be stored on a hard drive of a PC.  Only key personnel for 
this study will have access to the research data and access to this data will be terminated 
if/when the personnel are removed from the study. Research data will be maintained according 
the VA records schedule. Data containing PHI wi ll not leave the VA premises  A contract 
biostatistician will be used to analyze de -identified study data.  
 
Variables/Time Points of Interest  
The primary outcome of interest is the percentage of patients completing 12 weeks of 
treatment with  FDC MK -5172/MK -8742  (elbasvir/grazoprevir, Zepatier™).  Treatment 
completion will be defined as attendance at the last treatment visit (i.e.,Week 12).   
Adherence will be categorized into <90% adherence and > 90% adherence, based on an 
observed relationship between ribavirin adherence and early virologic response11. 
 
Statistical Methods  
Binary logistic regression analysis will be used to report adjusted odds ratios. Differences in the 
distribution of HSV -TSE -A scores across categorical visits (baseline vs. Week 4) will be accessed 
using Wilcoxon rank sum test. In addition, parametric models (linear regression) will be 
explored to estimate the differences.  
 
Power/Sample Size:  
In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_211772] 4 V eterans, we found that 75%) completed 12 weeks of treatment.  
Estimating a 90% ( 18/20 ) completion rate in the VBMI arm, we anticipate that a sample size 
of [ADDRESS_253732] sample sizes.  
Limitations : 
1) Enrollment bias may select for a di fferent population of SUD patients than those who do not 
participate . We have requested approval to record demographic information from patients 
who do not enroll, to allow comparison for signifi cant differences between groups in terms of 
age, race, gender .   
2)Patients with NS5a  mutations conferring resistance to elbasvir will require the addition of 
weight -based ribavirin and treatment extension to 16 weeks.  Based on our current 
observations of patients with HCV infection and SUD, we anticipate that 47% are infected  with 
genotype 1a . Estimating that 11% of patients with genotype 1a will have baseline NS5a 
resistance , we estimate that 2 patients will require 16 weeks of treatment.   We will not assess 
 
VMBI for SUD/HCV v.  6_10_19 
 adherence beyond 12 weeks of treatment and we will not assess adherence to ribavirin in this 
protocol.  
 
Adverse event reporting:  
Serious and unexpected adverse events to FDC MK-5172/MK -8742  (elbasvir/grazoprevir,

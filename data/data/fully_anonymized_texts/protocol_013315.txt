Submission by [INVESTIGATOR_20942] E. Lee, MD MPH   5/16/2018 2 Title:  A Randomized Controlled Trial for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_270356]: 
Comparison of Dural Puncture Epi[INVESTIGATOR_270358]:  
The incidence of m orbid obesity in the [LOCATION_002] is increasing, and in the last 30 
years, t he number of the super morbidly  obese [body mass index (BMI) over 50 kg/m2] has risen 
10-fold.1 In obstetric patients , morbid obesity often complicates the plac ement of neuraxial labor 
analgesia due to difficulties in positioning patients for placement and i dentifying landmarks . 
Morbid obesity also significantly increases a woman’s risk of requiring operative vaginal 
delivery or  cesarean delivery after a trial of  labor .2 Further, there is a strong correlation with 
increasing BMI and risk of emergenc y cesarean section.3  A study by [CONTACT_270399]. al  reports that in 
laboring women, 48% of morbid obese  women  (median BMI 52 kg/m2) require  emergency 
cesarean  while only 9% of the control group went on for emergency cesarean delivery .4 
Neuraxial anesthesia is well- establish ed as the preferred anesthetic technique for cesarean 
delivery due to the increased risks of administering general anesthesia to pregnant women. This 
is particularly relevant in the obese population since obesity increase the risk of difficult intubation. The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the [LOCATION_008] cites obesity 
as a major risk factor in failed intubations, and Hawkins et. al  report that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_270359]- related death in the US obstetric 
population.
5,6 A labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_270360] . Therefore, an 
early, established epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] ( EPL) may prevent emergent administration of general anesthesia and 
greatly reduce the associated risk s of serious complica tions. 
Unfortunately, placement of an adequate neur axial block can be  challenging for the 
Submission by [INVESTIGATOR_20942] E. Lee, MD MPH   5/16/[ADDRESS_329648] s 
for vertebral level  are often not visible or even palpable . Further more , adipose pockets in the 
subcutaneous  layer result in false spaces with loss -of-resistance technique. One study has found a 
42% EPL failure rate in the morbidly obese .4 Therefore, i t should be a priority to establish 
regional anesthesia early in labor.  
In modern practice, combined- spi[INVESTIGATOR_196613] s (CSE) have been used widely for labor 
analgesia. Benefits of the CSE include:  more rapid onset, decreased motor block, and uniform 
sensory blockade.7 In practice, however, some clinicians avoid CSE technique due to concerns 
about associated risk facto rs such as fetal bradycardia. Fetal bradycardia is thought to occur from 
the rapid onset of spi[INVESTIGATOR_270361]. The  remaining alpha 
activity leads to uterine contraction and therefore decreased uteroplacental blood f low.8,9 The 
CSE technique can further delay confirmation of a functional epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810].  This delay could 
result in complications if instrumented or emergent delivery  is imminent.  
In a novel technique described by [CONTACT_270400][INVESTIGATOR_270362].al , a dural puncture epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] (D PE) is 
performed by [CONTACT_40397] a perforation in the dura with a spi[INVESTIGATOR_270363].10 The return of cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) 
through the spi[INVESTIGATOR_270364] .11,[ADDRESS_329649] catheter . In theory, the DPE technique provides 
confirmation of midline placement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810]. Additionally, the dural perforation 
allows for translocation of medications administered in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_270365].
13 This has been shown to reduce time to achieve adequate pain relief from labor and 
reduce rates of uneven  sensory block. As reported by [CONTACT_270400][INVESTIGATOR_270362] . al, catheter replacement 
Submission by [INVESTIGATOR_20942] E. Lee, MD MPH   5/16/2018 4 decreased from 13% to 3% when introducing DPE. Their group also reports that unilateral 
blocks decreased from 25% to 8% and catheter adjustments from 28% to 13%.10 The same group 
completed a subsequent study that has been accepted for publication, which reports that clinician -administered epi [INVESTIGATOR_270366], or “top- ups” also decreased from 50% to 22.5% 
when introducing the DPE technique.
[ADDRESS_329650] epi[INVESTIGATOR_270367].  
Purpose of the study:  
The primary purpose  of this study is to determine if there are differences in block quality 
between the DPE and standard EPL techniques for labor analgesia in the morbidly obese patient. Establishing superiority of a technique is multifaceted and complex; therefore, the design of the 
study will define a set of measureable outcomes to assess these properties , which  will be 
addres sed in the subsequent sections. We hypothesize that when compared to the standard EPL, 
the DPE technique will significantly improve block quality in this population. 
The secondary purpose of the study is to find an optimal maintenance regimen for 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_270368]. For the maintenance of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187], it is common practice to use either continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_270369] a programmed intermittent bolus using a solution of r opi[INVESTIGATOR_270370] 0.1% with fentanyl ( 2 mcg/mL ). To dat e, there are no 
randomized prospective studies that investigate maintenance regimens in the morbidly obese parturient populati on. What has been shown is that s uper morbidly obese patient s have increased 
intra-abdominal and intracranial pressure  which incre ases pressure in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814]. Because 
of this elev ated pressure, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_270371], resulting in higher sensory blocks than 
necessary for adequate labor analgesia.
15 An important consequence is that the morbidly obese 
Submission by [INVESTIGATOR_20942] E. Lee, MD MPH   5/16/2018 5 parturient may experience additional undesirable  side effects to a labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]: increased 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], incre ased incidence of hypotension , and increased motor block.   
Design and procedures:   
We propose a prospective , double -blinded, randomized  trial. According to our patient 
population and incide nce of morbid obesity , enrollment would likely occur over a [ADDRESS_329651] 11% of our patients are morbidly obese.[ADDRESS_329652] 800 -900 morbidly obese 
women to deliver at our institution per year. We anticipate to complete enrollment before the protocol’s third annual renewal.  
Subject identification  and recruitment:  
Women admitted to the Duke Birthing Center for spontaneous or induced vaginal 
delivery will be screened. After usual consultation with the anesthesia team is completed and consent for anesthesia services are obtained, eligible patients will be approached to by a member 
of the study  team . As indicated below, we will plan to e nroll 130 patients ([ADDRESS_329653] group) and consent 150 women to reach this goal.  
Inclusion criteria for study eligibility include: ages 18- 45, si ngleton, vertex fetuses at 37-
41 weeks’ gestation , nulliparous and multiparous wome n, cervical dilation of 2- 7cm,  BMI ≥ 35 
kg/m
2, pain score > 4 , and English- speaking ability . Women with diseases of pregnancy that 
increase the risk of assisted vaginal  delivery or cesarean delivery ( i.e. major cardiac disease, 
chronic pain, chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], prior cesarean delivery , and maternal pelvic/hip disease) are 
will be excluded from the study. Women who cannot speak English will be excluded. 
Subject competency:  Only competent subjects will be approached to participate in this study.  
Costs to the subject:  
Submission by [INVESTIGATOR_20942] E. Lee, MD MPH   5/16/[ADDRESS_329654] to the subjects as a result of participation in this research 
study.  There will be no compensation to patients for their participation in this study.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_270372]:  
Once the patient requests a labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], the usual standard of care for epi[INVESTIGATOR_270373]. The patient will have at lea st one 18g intravenous catheter  and will 
receive 500- 1000mL fluid administration . Vitals will be monitored by [CONTACT_270401], including 
continuous pulse oxim etry, non- invasive blood- pressure monitoring, and external 
tocodynamometry. Anesthesia time -out will be performed by [CONTACT_270402].  
All patients will receive a neuraxial technique in the sitting position at L3/4 or L4/5 using 
loss of resistance to saline. In the DPE group, a 25 -g Whitacre needle will be used to puncture 
the dura. In both groups, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_270374] 5 cm in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_270375] 15 ml of r opi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.1% with fentanyl (2 mcg/ml) over [ADDRESS_329655] patient -controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187] (PCEA) available with an 8 ml dose per demand, 
every 10 minutes, for a maximum dose of 45 ml for every hour.  
Assignment of Study Cohorts:  
Study participants will be randomized by [CONTACT_22123] -generated sequence to EPL  or DPE 
arms, stratified by [CONTACT_270403] (BMI ≥ 35<40 kg/m2 , ≥40<50  kg/m2 and ≥ 50 kg/m2) and by 
[CONTACT_147681] (nulliparous versus multiparous).  Patients will be assigned to one of the four study arms by [CONTACT_22123] -generated, randomized sequence in order to balance baseline characteristics across 
the arms. This will be a double -blinded study. After the consented and enrolled participant

Protocol for Breakthrough Pain 
- If the patient has uneven or unilateral level , the provider will withdrawal catheter 1cm 
from skin and bolus 5ml of epi[INVESTIGATOR_270376]. As fetal heart rate allows for maternal 
repositioni ng, the patient will lay lateral position with unblocked side in the 
dependent position. (up to 3 catheter adjustments)  
- If the patient has bilateral levels at that below T10 to ice, the patient will be administered [ADDRESS_329657] will determine if epi[INVESTIGATOR_270377].  
Data analysis and monitoring:  
The primary outcome of this study is block quality which will be defined by a composite 
of five  components  (1) asymmetric block after 30 minutes of initiation, (2) top -up interventions, 
(3) cath eter adjustments (4) failed catheter requiring replacement, and (5) failed epi[INVESTIGATOR_270378].   
The composite outcome is a practical endpoint for our study because while necessary to determine block quality, incidence of failed epi[INVESTIGATOR_270379] -sided epi[INVESTIGATOR_270380]. All five  
components are of similar importance when assessing the quality of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187]. Therefore, this outcome definition will increase the p ower of the study, without sacrificing 
clinical relevance or feasibility . 
Submission by [INVESTIGATOR_20942] E. Lee, MD MPH   5/16/2018 8 Block level will be measured by [CONTACT_270404] , and levels that are 
greater than two dermatomal levels would be considered asymmetric. Lower  extremity 
dermatomal  levels will be assessed by [CONTACT_270405] (L1), anterior thigh (L2), 
medial knee (L3), medial malleolus (L4), between the great and second toe (L5), the lateral heel 
(S1), and the medial popliteal fossa (S2). On the thoracic levels, the t orso will be assessed 
bilaterally at the mid -clavicular line.  
Secondary outcomes include time to numeric pain rating scale ≤1, maternal adverse 
events (hypotension, fetal bradycardia, PDPH), motor block, duration of second stage of labor, total labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_270381], total anesthetic dose required, PCEA use, and mode of delivery.  
Statistical Methods:  
The primary assessment of difference in the composite outcome between the two epi[INVESTIGATOR_270382] -square test.  Using data from a  recent retrospective study on 
labor maintenance regimens published by [CONTACT_27156], we expect the composite event rate to be 35% in the group receiving EPL.
17 Based on the findings by [CONTACT_270406].  of a 62% relative 
reduction in breakthrough pain with a CSE technique compared to an EPL, we will define a clinically meaningful effect in our study as a similar reduction in the composite outcome to be 14% in the DPE group, which corresponds to an odds ratio of 0.30.
[ADDRESS_329658] for the 
difference in composite outcome rates between epi[INVESTIGATOR_270383] 0.05 will reach 
80% power to detect an odds ratio of 0.[ADDRESS_329659] in a study of 130 patients ([ADDRESS_329660]).  
Further analysis of the difference in the composite outcome between the two epi[INVESTIGATOR_270384]. Comparison of additional secondary outcomes between the epi[INVESTIGATOR_270385] E. Lee, MD MPH   5/16/2018 9 maternal adverse events, total labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_270381], total anesthetic dose required, mode of 
delivery, and degr ee of motor block will be compared with χ2 tests and logistic regression. The 
time to numeric pain rating scale ≤1 will be compared between the two epi[INVESTIGATOR_270386] -Meier estimates and log -rank tests.  
Data will be monitored closely for the occurrence of adverse events ( AE) and reported to 
the IRB as needed. If unanticipated AEs or if expected events appear to be occurring more 
frequently than expected, those AEs will be explored per treatment arm.  
In ac cordance with federal regulations , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_147427], review, and promptly 
report to the IRB, appropriate institutional officials, sponsor, coordinating center and the appropriate regulatory agency head all unanticipated problems involving risks to s ubjects or 
others that occur in the course of a subject’s participation in a research study (45 CFR 46.103(b)(5)(i) and 21 CFR 56.108(b)(1)), all AE reports will be reported per the DUHS IRB policies.  
Data storage and confidentiality:  
Study records will re main confidential as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Federal Privacy regulations 
ensure privacy, security and authorized access. Patient identifiers including but not limited to name, social security number, address, and telephone number will not be disclosed outside of the Duke University Health System (DUHS).  For records shared with parties outside of DUHS, patients will receive a unique code number. The key to the code will be kept in a locked file in [CONTACT_270407]’s office.  
Risk/benefit assessment:  
The will be no benefit to subjects from participating in the study, since standard of care 
regimens will be used in this study . The information gained from the study will help elucidate if

 1 PURPOSE  
The objective of this prospective, multi- center, two-arm randomized, blinded study is to 
demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the LUM Imaging System (LUM015 imaging agent in 
conjunction with the LUM Imaging Device and decision software), in identifying residual cancer in the lumpectomy bed of female breast cancer patients.  The s ize of this study is driven by [CONTACT_402094] ; therefore, we propose an event -driven clinical 
study. Patients will be enrolled until [ADDRESS_506538] positive events are reported, up to a 
maximum of 450 patients. 
2 SUMMARY OF ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Three co-p rimary endpoint s 
• Ratio of patients who have  residual cancer found in at least one Lumicell- guided shave 
(also known as therapeutic shave) among all patients. Residual cancer is defined as tumor 
found by [CONTACT_402095] a therapeut ic shave after the SOC surgical procedure is completed; 
that is, tumor that current SOC surgery failed to remove. 
• Instrument diagnostic accuracy measured as two separate endpoints of sensitivity  and 
specificity  on a per- tissue basis.  
2.[ADDRESS_506539] a LUM Imaging System signal  in the cavity above the threshold as 
defined by [CONTACT_402096] (i.e., a positive LUM signal). 
b. Propor tion of subjects with pathology- positive margins after standard of care breast -
conserving surgery for whom additional LUM Imaging System -guided shaves resulted in 
pathology- negative margins among patients  with positive margins . Note: This endpoint 
also estimates the potential reduction in re -excision surgeries following standard of care 
breast -conserving surgery that resulted from a positive SOC margin.  
c. Proportion of subjects with pathology- positive margins after standard of care breast -
conserving surgery f or whom additional LUM Imaging System -guided shaves resulted in 
pathology- negative margins among all patients . 
d. Ratio of patients with negative margins after the SOC procedure who have residual cancer 
found in at least one Lumicell-guided (or therapeutic) shave among patients with negative margins . 
e. Ratio of patients with negative margins after the SOC procedure who have residual cancer found in at least one Lumicell-guided (or therapeutic) shave among all patients 
f. Mean and median incremental volume ( in cubic centimeters) of tissue removed from 
therapeutic shaves:  For each patient, absolute shave volume will be calculated as length (c) 
× width (c) × depth (c) for each therapeutic shave with the sum by [CONTACT_402097]. Subjects with no therapeutic shaves taken will have a therapeutic shave volume of 0cc. 
g. Mean and median contribution of therapeutic shave volume to total tissue removed. 
h. Comparison of adverse events in subjects that have at least one therapeutic shave versus subjects that have no therapeutic shaves.

[ADDRESS_506541]. For invasive car cinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a positive margin is 
defined as having tumor present at the inked side of the outermost surface of the lumpectomy specimen [1, 2]. However, according to the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) , for negative 
margins of less than 2mm in patients with DCIS, clinical judgment is recommended to determine 
the need for a second surgical procedu re [2]. Positive lumpectomy margins are  the most important 
risk factor for local recurrence  of breast cancer  [1-5] and dictate that a second surgical procedure 
be performed to obtain t umor- free margins . The r ates of close or positive margins have been 
reported between 17 to 59% [ 6-10]. Among the more than 318,[ADDRESS_506542] require d additional surgery for positive margins  [11]. Thus, a diagnosis 
of positive margins indicates that additional treatments are needed . This  places a heavy burden on 
patients and  adds signif icant  cost to the healthcare system .

as described above. This procedure is time consuming, often requiring 7- 10 days of pathology 
testing after the operation before margin status is known. In addition, this process is prone to 
sampling errors , as only a finite number of tissue slices can be examined , meaning that only a 
small fraction of the lumpectomy margin surface is assessed, < 1% of lumpectomy surface area by [CONTACT_137006] [ 2]. Thus, a safe method to directly assess the entire tumor bed intraoperatively 
and identify residual microscopic disease for immediate resection intraoperatively would be highly 
beneficial for patients.

 Lumicell has developed the LUM Imag ing System, which consists of a fluorescence- based 
imaging agent (LUM015), a hand- held, wide -field detector (LUM Imaging Device) that can image 
the lumpectomy cavity in seconds , and a tumor detection algorithm that highlights regions 
suspected to contain cancer and displays them on a computer monitor.  The LUM Imaging system 
is intended to be used to scan the lumpectomy cavity walls intraoperatively after the resection of 
the main lumpectomy s pecimen.  
The purpose of the Lumicell  Imaging  System  is to enable surgeons to achieve  negative margins  
during the initial surgery and eliminate or reduce the need for re- excision surgeries when compared 
with current standard of care procedures. Lumicell’s system images the entire lumpectomy cavity surface in vivo, overcoming tissue handling and sampling limitations of standard pathology 
analysis of resected tissue. The LUM Imaging System provides real -time feedback to the surgeon 
about the status of the lumpectomy cavity walls.  
The LUM Imaging System has been tested in a two- phase Feasibility Study at the [LOCATION_005] 
General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. There were 15 patients in Phase A and 45 patients in Phase B in the study.  Of the 11 Lumicell imaged subjects for whom a pathology positive margin followed SOC, the LUM 
Imaging Devi ce detected 9 (82%) of the subjects with residual cancer in the cavity. A multi -site 
Feasibility Phase C study is being conducted to refine and verify the tumor detection algorithm 
and to complete hands on training of surgeons and clinical staff. 
3.3 Definitio ns 
3.3.1 Definitions of excised tissue  
• Main specimen : also known as the “lump” or main mass, refers to the primary pi[INVESTIGATOR_402071] a lumpectomy.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this is the largest  pi[INVESTIGATOR_402072].  
• Shave  types : pi[INVESTIGATOR_402073]. In this study, we define three different types of shave d cavity 
margins (SCMs ) below. 
o Selective shaves: shaved cavity margins removed from a specific location of the 
lumpectomy cavity wall based on intraoperative analysis of the intact main specimen by [CONTACT_402102] X- ray imaging, ultrasound imaging, palpation, 
frozen sections  or visual examination.  Selective shaves precede  all other SCMs  
described  below. 
o Comprehensive shaves : shaved cavity margins removed from all available 
surfaces of the lumpectomy cavity walls after resection of the specimen based 
on the SOC for that surgeon/site 
o Therapeutic  shaves : shaved  cavity  margins  removed following  the guidance of 
the LUM Imaging System; may also be referred to as Lumicell -guided shaves.

practices perform what is defined in this protocol as a “standard lumpectomy procedure ”. This 
procedure consists of the surgeon’s best attempt to remove the main specimen with grossly 
negative margins and may be followed by [CONTACT_402103] (see definition above). 
Some institutions have implemented additional margin management techniques such as comprehensive shaves, as defined above, to try to lower the rates of positive margins and re -

given orientation that can come from the main specimen or a comprehensive shave when a shave exists.  
 
3.3.3 Definition of endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of positive margins  
For this protocol, positive margins are defined using the latest consensus from the Society of 
Surgical Oncology as follows: 
• For invasive cancer with or without associated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): cancer cells or DCIS present on ink [ 1] 
• For pure DCIS lesions: DCIS present less than 2 mm from the ink [ 2] 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of re -excision s 
A re-excision is defined as a surgical procedure performed in the ipsilateral breast following the 
primary lumpectomy because of positive margins found from the initial lumpectomy procedure. The re -excision procedure  can be a separate surgical procedure to excise further breast tissue or a 
mastectomy.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition  of positive cavity  
After the standard lumpectomy procedure, a positive cavity occurs when tumor is found in a 
therapeutic shave or during a re-excision.  
[ADDRESS_506545] consisting of the LUM015 imaging  agent and 
the LUM Imaging Device. LUM015 is administered to the patient via intravenous injection 4 ± [ADDRESS_506546] conserving surgery 
(lumpectomy) to remove breast cancer. The LUM Imaging System is not indicated for those 
subjects receiving administration of blue (e.g. methylene blue, isosu lfan blue) or green (e.g. 
indocyanine green) dyes for sentinel lymph node mappi[INVESTIGATOR_402074] . The LUM Imaging System is intended to be used whenever breast tissue is removed, 
histopathology evaluation of the tissue is the standard of care and/or it is essential that the tissue margins be examined for completeness of removal using standard surgica l procedures. The LUM 
Imaging System is to be used in vivo  following the excision of the main lumpectomy specimen to 
assist in locating residual abnormal tissue, therefore, facilitating tumor resection and potentially 
creating negative margins on the outer most surfaces of excised tissue. 
4.3 LUM015  imaging agent 
Lumicell engineered LUM015, a fluorescence- based imaging agent that accumulates within and 
around cells.  In regions enriched with cathepsin enzymes , such as cancer cells, LUM015 is altered 
to fluoresce  when illuminated with 649 nm light . In its n ominal  state, the fluorescence of LUM015 
is suppressed by [CONTACT_402106] (QSY21). The presence of cathepsin enzymes is 
not fully confined to cancer cells; hence, data from this study will help det ermine the cancer 
localization properties of LUM015.  O nce cathepsin  enzymes cleave LUM015 at its amino acid 
backbone, the quencher is released and the fluorescent dye (Cy5) in LUM015 emits detectable fluorescence when it absorbs red light  (Figure 1). The absorption and emission wavelength 
maxima for Cy5 are 649 nm and 670 nm respectively. LUM015 employs a fluorescent molecule 
with excitation and emission in the far red spectrum ( > 600 nm wavelength) because in that range 
light can travel effectively through 1mm of tissue and tissue autofluorescence is minimal, allowing higher sensitivity due to lower background [ 14]. 
 
Figure 1: Schematic representation of LUM015.  
Cathepsins are a family of enzymes that are involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix to allow tumor growth and progression. These enzymes are upregulated in most human cancers 
and are also present in tumor- associated  macrophages at the tumor ’s invasive front [ 15-19]. Platt 
et al.  show ed 60-fold higher cathepsin acti vity in breast cancer tissue than in healthy breast tissue  
[20]. Others report o ver-expression of cathepsin enzymes (B, K, L and D) in ductal carcinoma in 
situ as well as in invasive carcinomas (lobular and ductal) [ 16, 20-23 ]. Also, cathepsin B is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_139701] -expressed in inflammatory breast cancer, one of the most lethal forms of primary 
breast cancer . [24, 25]. The peptide sequence used in LUM015 is a pan- cathepsin substrate LUM015 PEG 20K

 meaning that it will be cleaved by m ultiple enzymes of the cathepsin family. Because high activity 
of cathepsin enzymes is found in tumor cells and tumor associated macrophages surrounding the 
tumor at the invasive front, these enzymes provide an excellent marker for activating LUM015 at the tumor margin. The fluorescence of LUM015 is then induced and detected with the LUM Imaging System to identify cancer and cancer -related cells for immediate resection and to 
distinguish them from adjacent normal tissue . 
4.4 LUM Imaging Device 
The LUM Imaging Device consists of a computer control unit, monitor and light source mounted on a cart, and a hand- held optical head (LUM002/LUM003) . The computer control unit collects, 
analyzes (based upon Lumicell’s detection algorithm) and displays the resulting images gathered by [CONTACT_402107] -time. The light source provides the illumination to excite the 
fluorescent dye present in LUM015. Light is tr ansferred from the light source to the imaging head 
using an optical fiber bundle. The imaging head ( Figure 2) was designed as a lightweight hand -
held tool with a small profile to allow easy maneuverability and limited intrusiveness in the 
operating room. Because incisions and lumpectomy cavities can vary in size, Lumicell offers two 
options for the distal end diameter: LUM002, which has a 2.[ADDRESS_506547] a 45° bend at the distal end for examination of the walls of the lumpectomy cavity.  
The hand- held optical head will be used within the sterile surgical field.  Consequently, a ste rile 
barrier assembly will be provided to cover the optical head, which comes into contact [CONTACT_402108]’s exposed tumor bed. The sterile barrier assembly is installed on the LUM Optical Head in the OR using sterile  procedures.

 The LUM Imaging System is powered by [CONTACT_402109]’s proprietary decision software. The decision 
software  uses an initial set of images acquired from the lumpectomy cavity after the main specimen 
is removed to set the tumor detection threshold. Then, while the surgeon scans the lumpectomy 
cavity walls with the LUM Optical Head, the decision software compares the intensity of an image 
against the tumor detection threshold and identifies  whether a region of the image is suspected to 
contain tumor. Regions with fluorescence signal above the threshold are highlighted in the 
computer monitor for the surgeon to see in real- time; that is, there is no delay between the scanning 
of a region and the display of the results from that region.  Figure [ADDRESS_506549] cancer patients.

4.6.1 Summary of three phases of the Fea sibility study  (all completed) 
• Phase A ( n=15 patients ): patients were administered with either no LUM015 (5 patients) 
or a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (5 patients) or 1.0 mg/kg (5 patients) 4 ± [ADDRESS_506551] of care cavity shaves. Resected cavity shaves were also imaged. The imaging results were compared with pathology analysis of the cavity shaves. The endpoints were: (1) select a dose of LUM015 for Phase B; (2) determine the parameters of the tumor detection threshold; and (3) acquire safety data. No clinical action was taken by [CONTACT_402110]. A dose of 1.0 mg/kg was selected for Phase B and all subsequent clinical studies in breast cancer.  
• Phase B ( n=45 patients ):  the tumor detection threshold was implemented and the LUM 
Imaging System was used to scan the lumpectomy cavity to guide the removal of additional cavity shaves beyond the standard of care cavity shaves. The endpoints were: (1 ) evaluate 
and, if necessary, adjust  the detection algorithm parameters, (2) adjust, if necessary, the 
protocol for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076], and (3) collect safety data.

 • Phase C (multi- center evaluation, n=234 patients ):  the tumor detection threshold and 
the LU M Imaging System was evaluated at multiple sites to (1) collect data to refine and 
verify the tumor detection algorithm, (2) complete hands -on training of surgeons and 
clinical staff that will be participating in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397], (3) identify and address  any site -
specific or user -specific issues for using the LUM Imaging System in breast cancer 
surgeries, and (4) collect safety and efficacy data.  
Once a surgeon wa s trained in the use of the LUM Imaging System during Phase C of the 
Feasibility Study, the t umor detection algorithm was locked and this protocol has been initiated, 
the surgeon may begin enrolling patients for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]. Any surgeon or site that did not 
participate in the Phase C study will be required to undergo training and complete a modified 
proficiency program  before starting enrollment for this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]. 
No serious adverse events were  observed in both Phase A and Phase B of the Feasibility  Study. The 
only adverse  event noted in these two phases was  a temporary  blue discoloration  at the injection  
site for LUM015 that resulted from extravasation of LUM015 during injection (see details in 
section 11.2) One patient enrolled in the Phase C study, with known hypersensitivity to contrast, 
expe rienced an anaphyla ctic reaction to the LUM015 injection. The patient recovered in <[ADDRESS_506552] cancer  CL0007r08

5.2 Methods  
5.2.1 Establishing a patient in the electronic data capture system (EDC)   
All consented patients should be entered into the electronic data capture system prior to surgery.  5.2.2 Collection of baseline Patient Reported Outcome  Measures Data 
After the patient has consented to participate and has consented to the collection of Patient 
Reported Outcome  Measure s (PROMs)  Data, prior to surgery start, each enrolled subject should 
complete this  baseline survey collecting data to support an evaluation of PROMs. Baseline 
evaluations will be electronically collected using the EDC system  at any time after the patient 
consented to parti cipate in the study and prior to their lumpectomy procedure .  If the patient has 
not yet completed their survey at the time of injection, the study site should facilitate and remind the patient to complete their survey.  The patient should not  complete the  baseline survey after the 
lumpectomy procedure.  The completion of the survey is not a requirement to be enrolled into the study. Alternatives to electronic distribution  of the surveys may be implemented.

 All consented a nd eligible patients will be injected with LUM015 at a dose of 1.0  mg/kg 4  ± [ADDRESS_506554]’s status as ‘enrolled’. Once a subject is classified as ‘enrolled’, 
the subject will be randomized to either the control arm or the treatment arm of this study. Although the subject is randomized at the time of enrollment, the randomization will not be revealed to the study team until after the standard of care lumpectomy is completed.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_506555] of car e comprehensive shaves or selective shaves (based on palpation  
of the main  specimen  or cavity walls,  X-ray imaging  of the intact  main  specimen , intraoperative 
frozen section pathology, or visual  examination), the surgeon shall record a  LUM image from all 
the orientations from which an SOC shave will be removed. At this time, the tumor detection  
algorithm will be “off” to allow fluorescence visualization and navigation of the lumpectomy 
cavity without highlighting of suspected tumor that may bias normal standard of care . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior to obtaining any SOC shaves or associated images, the surgeon shall document their  
intent of obtaining SOC shaves on the study worksheet. 
[IP_ADDRESS] When there is no tissue available to be removed  from a given orientation  (e.g., too close 
to skin or too close to the chest wall), no LUM image shall be collected from that 
orientation.   This information must be documented.  
[IP_ADDRESS] The surgeon shall place the optical head at the cavity location where a standard of care shave will be taken , instruct the computer operator when to save the image and define the 
image orientation.  
[IP_ADDRESS] The surgeon shall take the standard of care shave from the imaged location.  
[IP_ADDRESS] The surgeon shall repeat steps [IP_ADDRESS]- [IP_ADDRESS] for all cavity location(s) where a standard 
of care shave will be taken.  
[IP_ADDRESS] The resected tissue(s) shall be handled and named according to the Appendix  B. 
Standard of care margin assessment will  be made by [CONTACT_402111]. If a positive margin is determined, this subject will be included in

intervention. Randomization will be performed at a ratio of 10:1 ; for every [ADDRESS_506557] of care  (“to proceed”), [ADDRESS_506558] of care alone  (“not to proceed”) . The randomization  is 
intended to mitigate  potential surgeon bias, and the 10:1 ratio was chosen based on prior  clinical 
studies that supported imaging agent  efficacy trials.     
5.2.8 Lumicell procedure ( only patients randomized to the intervention arm ) 
After the standard of care  is completed for patients randomized “to proceed” with the Lumicell 
intervention, the surgeon will scan the tumor bed to collect images  of the cavity  walls  and remove 
therapeutic shaves as indicated  by [CONTACT_402112] (refer to the Instructions F or Use 
manual for details).  The software  will automatically turn on the tumor detection algorithm to allow 
visualization and navigation of the lumpectomy cavity with highlighting of suspected tumor by [CONTACT_402096].  
[IP_ADDRESS] When there is no tissue available to be removed from a given orientation (e.g., too close to skin or too close to the chest wall), no LUM image shall be collected from that orientation.   This information must be documented.  
[IP_ADDRESS] The surgeon shall scan the cavity and generate images from each orientation.  Images 
should be generated and saved for both LUM positive and negative results. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The surgeon shall take a Lumicell shave from each imaged location indicated as “positive” by  [CONTACT_402112].  
[IP_ADDRESS] A maximum of two (2) Lumicell shaves may be taken from any one orientation. Additional Lumicell shaves beyond 2 per orientation will constitute a protocol violation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The resected tissue(s) shall be handled and named according to the Appendix B.

5.3.1 Guidance on removing therapeutic shaves  
Therapeutic shaves should be removed anytime the LUM Ima ging System indicates signal above 
the threshold ( LUM positive signal shown in red in the computer screen). However, if there is not 
enough tissue to be removed (e.g. too close to skin, too close chest wall) , a Lumicell image shall 
not be recorded and a th erapeutic  shave shall not be removed. This should be documented. Protocol 
deviations for not imaging and for not obtaining a therapeutic shave will not be issued when tissue 
is not obtained because there is not enough tissue to be removed.

email address will be entered into the electronic data capture system, but will be bl inded to the 
Sponsor and Sponsor representatives and only available to database administrators  and the clinical 
site. Survey s will be collected at four time points: (1) baseline (before lumpectomy), (2) standard 
of care follow -up after lumpectomy , (3) three  months post lumpectomy and (4) six  months post 
lumpectomy  (± 6 weeks) .  Data to be collected may  include information about the patient’s breast

criteria.   Patients who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed in the protocol will fail 
screening and not be eligible to participate in the study.  The subject is not considered enrolled into 
the study until written Informed Consent is obtained, the patient is confirmed  as eligible  per 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the investigational product has been administered (Study Day 
One).    
Clinical site s are asked to keep comprehensive Screening and Enrollment logs and provide these 
logs to Lumicell on a regular basis.  
7.2 Enrollment  process  
Patients who consent to participate in this study should be evaluated for eligibility.  All patients 
who consent should be entered into the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  Screening procedure data should be recorded in the EDC. The site study team should notify Lumicell of a potential 
candidate for the study and expected surgery date after the subject has been consented. 
The enrollment procedures are as follows:  
1. Obtain written informed consent from the subject prior to the performance of any study 
related procedures or assessments.  
2. Assign the subject a study subject ID number  and enter the subject in the EDC.  The 
numbers should follow the Lumicell assigned format as described at the Site Initiation 
Visit in compliance with the Case Report Form nomenclature . All patients who 
consent should be entered into the electronic data capture (EDC) system.   
3. Confirm protocol -specific eligibility using the eligibility assessment documented in the 
subject ’s medical/research record. To be eligible for enrollment  to the study, the 
subject  must meet each inclusion and have none of the exclusion criteria listed 
in the eligibility  section of this protocol . 
4. Notify Lumicell clinical team of eligible subject status and date of proposed surgery.  
5. The subject is considered ‘enrolled’ once they have been administered LUM015 (day 
of surgery) 
8  INTERVENTIONAL PLAN   
8.1 LUM015 administration 
The investigational imaging agent LUM015 will be administered at the surgical center or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 4 ± [ADDRESS_506577] ’s malignancy  intraoperatively.  
As per IV injection standard of care, all subject s will be observed for signs of extravasation , or 
allergic re action following administration of LUM015 to monitor for adverse pharmacological 
activity related to the investigational agent. If extravasation is suspected or conf irmed, the injection

07APR [ADDRESS_506578]- operative visit (approximately 2 -3 weeks after surgery).  
If there is evidence supporting that extravasation of LUM015 injection occurred, then that patient 
will be excluded from the efficacy cohort. However, the patient will be included in the safety data 
analysis.  
If the patient is experiencing an allergic reaction to LUM015 administration, the injection should 
be stopped immediately, and the following lab values should be obtained: 
• Histam ine 
• Total Blood C omplement 
• Tryptase levels  
The blood draw for each of these tests should be done as soon as possible after the start of the reaction and again at [ADDRESS_506579] any residual drug remaining in 
the used syringe. This drug should be stored at - 20 degrees C until a Lumicell representative 
notifies your site of how to proceed with the used syringe.  If this process conflicts with site specific SOPs, the clinical site should notify Lumicell in advance of study start that residual drug will not be able to be maintained.  
8.2 General concomitant medication and supportive c are guidelines  
A complete listing  of all medications (including non- prescription, vitamins , herbal products  and 
essential oils ) currently being taken on a regular basis prior to surgery will be obtained at screening 
and updated as needed at enrollment and at the post -operative follow -up visit. Medications 
administered during the study related surgery should be recorded. Concomitant medications should 
be collected for up to 2 weeks after LUM015 injection and study related surgery. Concomitant 
medications should only be collected after this time point if a related AE/SAE is r eported during 
the follow -up period. Concomitant medications will be recorded in the medical record and case 
report form.  
8.3 Duration of t herapy  
The imaging agent LUM015 will be injected as a single dose 4 ± [ADDRESS_506580] image 
recorded . There is no recurrent administration of the imaging agent. The treatment ends after the 
surgery is completed. Subjects may be discontinued by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_402080]: 
• unacceptable adverse event  or adverse device effect  
• administrative reasons, such as imaging agent no longer available

sodium and creatinine/creatinine clearance) tests to assess for possible adverse events. At the time 
of the visit, the patient will be intervie wed to determine any potential adverse events.  Subject s 
with adverse events that are determined to be possibly related to the investigational product will 
be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  This visit occurs per the standard 
of care post -operative visit schedule; there is no protocol specified window.  In the event a post -
operative standard of care visit does not occur, the reason for no visit should be documented and the patient should be contact[CONTACT_402115].  
For subjects who opt to participate, PROMs  will be collected via electronic survey at four time 
points: (1) baseline (before lumpectomy), (2) standard of care follow -up after lumpectomy,  (3) 
three months post lumpectomy and (4) six months post lumpectomy. Surveys will be sent  to the 
study subject via a secure portal associated with the electronic data capture (EDC) system . 
Alternatives to electronic distribution of the surveys may be implemented.  Patients who are 
participating in the c ompletion of th e PROM s survey data will not have new adverse events 
collected or reported after the follow -up period has concluded as described in this section.  
8.[ADDRESS_506582] be documented in the study-
specific  case report form (CRF).  A subject removed from the study will be given standard of care

Individual patients may be discontinued from the study by [CONTACT_402116] (e .g., continuation in 
the study represents a serious medical risk to the patient). This may include, but is not limited to, the presence of serious, l ife-threatening adverse events , unanticipated adverse device effects, 
adverse events, or adverse device effects that are unacceptable in nature, severity, or frequency as 
assessed by [CONTACT_737].  
Patients must not be enrolled  if, prior to study drug i njection, t hey become pregnant or withdraw 
consent. While patients will be encouraged to complete the study, they may voluntarily withdraw at any time.  
In the event of unusual or life -threatening complications, participating investigators must 
immediately notify Lumicell .

 An individual is considered to be a participant once she is enrolled or entered into the study.  This 
would include subjects that are eligible for contributing data to the scientific aims and consented for participation, including individuals who subsequently dropout.  Subjects who are screened for participation but are not eligible (because of not meeting inclusion/exclusion or because LUM015 was not injected) or who do not consent would not be considered as participants. 
Prospective exclu sions from the efficacy analysis population  will include : 1) patients for whom 
the LUM015 systemic injection was not performed properly and ( 2) major protocol deviations. 
These patients will be included in the safety analysis cohort. 8.[ADDRESS_506583] has approved the study to continue.

Device.  
• Any other  event that is deemed  unacceptable in nature, severity, or frequency as 
assessed by [CONTACT_16627]. 
• Data Safety Monitoring Board recommendation after unexpected event  
In addition to routine Data Safety Monitoring Board me etings, an ad- hoc meeting will occur if the 
occurrence of allergic reactions occurs more frequently than the expected rate.  The DSMB will 
review details of the events and will generate a recommendation for study continuation or 
termination .  
In the case that a safety event requiring enrollment suspension occurs, a prompt cumulative review 
of safety data and the circumstances of the event in question will be conducted to determine whether recruitment can  be resumed, whether the protocol should be modified, or whether the 
study will be discontinued permanently. The FDA and reviewing IRB must be notified of any 
event that triggers suspension of enrollment in this  study. If enrollment is suspended for safety 
reasons and it is deemed appropriate to resume the study, approval from the Data Safety 
Monitoring Board must be obtained prior to resuming the study. The FDA and reviewing IRB will 
be notified when enrollment in this study is resumed.

were imaged with the LUM device  at the time of study -stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_402081].  
In addition to the safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_402082], Lumicell may suspend or terminate this study at any time. The reasons for temporarily suspending or terminating the study may include but are not limited to the following:  
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory  
• Non-compliance that might significantly jeopardize the validity or integrity of the study. 
• Lumicell decision to terminate development.

Medical Center. The primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate the safety of the LUM015 drug component. As a secondary endpoint, the signals from normal and tumo r tissue were 
measured ex vivo using the LUM Imaging Device component. Twelve (12) sarcoma patients and three (3) breast cancer patients (invasive ductal carcinoma) were injected with LUM015 at doses ranging from 0.5 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg with no adverse pharmacological activity reported.  The only noticeable effect in the study subjects w as blue/ green discoloration of urine, which resolved within 
12-[ADDRESS_506588] cancer  with 294 patients  enrolled   (n=15 
in Phase A, n=45 in Phase B, n=234 in Phase  C), with [ADDRESS_506589]  agents enrolled in the Phase C 
study experienced an anaphylaxis reaction to the LUM015 injection.  The patient recovered in <[ADDRESS_506590] 3 eligible subjects were dosed at 0.5mg/kg LUM015 and 
the second 3 subjects were dosed at 1.0mg/kg LUM015, with both groups injected ~29 hours prior 
to surgery. Resected tissue was imaged with the LUM Imaging Device in the pathology suite . A 
comparison of pharmacokinetic data from the initial 6 subjects to preclinical mouse studies 
suggested th at a higher tumor:normal signal ratio would be achieved if tissue were  imaged 4 -6 
hours after injection. The next 3 subjects were injected with 1.0mg/kg of LUM015 and followed by 3 subjects injected with 1.5 mg/kg of LUM015 and the final cohort of 3 subjec ts was injected 
with 0.5mg/kg. These nine subjects were followed by [CONTACT_402120] 6 hours after LUM015 injection (i.e. same day injection and surgery). 
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of LUM015, plasma PK samples were colle cted at 
the following time -points: pre -dose, 10, [ADDRESS_506591]-dose.  
The 48-hour collection was optional. Analysis of LUM 015 (as Frag 1 after trypsin digestion of 
plasma) and Frag ment 1 (non- digested plasma) were measured by [CONTACT_29864] -MS/MS. Additional 
metabolites, Fragment  2 and Frag ment  3 were  measured by [CONTACT_5004] -fluorescence.  
A non-compartmental approach within Win -Nonlin software was used for PK parameter 
estimation. Due to a relative complexity of the PK profile observed and data constraints inherent 
in the study (small number of patients per dose level, optional data from 22- 48 hours), a 
compartmenta l modeling approach was not utilized. Out of the 15 subjects , the 48-h time-point 
sample was collected  in 9 patients. Thus, in order to make use of the wealth of data collected up 
to 22 hours (all 15 patients from the study), but also us e potentially important 48-hour data from 
the limited set of 9 subjects, PK calculations were performed on both sets (22 -hour and 48-hour ) 
independently. A summary of the resulting PK parameters for LUM015 are presented in

The event was resolved within 24 hours of occurrence. We now consider anaphylactic reaction an expected adverse event, with occasional  occurrence and serious severity. 
Table 4 below lists the expected adverse events 
due to LUM015 injection with their estimated occurrence and severity.  
Table 4 : List of expected adverse events due to LUM015 administration.  
Adverse Eve nts 
(Drug Related):  Occurrence : Severity:  
LUM015 extravasation  Occasional  Minor  
Chromaturia  Frequent  Negligible  
Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity  Occasional  Serious  
 
No adverse events related to the administration of LUM015 were observed during the Phase 1 IND 
safety study. Temporary blue/green discoloration of the urine was noted in these patients due to the blue color of LUM015. Prior to the Phase 1 study, LUM015 had not previously been used in 
humans. Lumicell’s  preclinical studies demonstrated that it was reasonably safe to proceed with a 
Phase 1 IND study in humans. Preclinical studies in rats showed no LUM015 related effects on clinical observations, FOB evaluatio n, body weights, food consumption, ocular condition, clinical 
chemistry, hematology and coagulation parameters or organ weight at doses up to 53- fold higher 
than in humans. 
The results from th e repeat dose toxicity study in dogs (performed by [CONTACT_12134] ) show tha t 
administration of 0.5 or 10.0 mg/kg of LUM015 intravenously once daily for seven consecutive 
days (8 total doses) did not cause any observable target organ toxicities. The only observable effect was hypersensitivity in several dogs.  
The results from a r epeat dose toxicity study in rabbits show that administration of 15 mg/kg of 
LUM015 intravenously one daily for seven consecutive days was well tolerated. The test article -
related findings were limited to transient blue/ green discoloration of the urine. Th ere were no test 
article -related adverse events observed and no hypersensitivity was seen.  
Additional information is available in the Investigator’s Brochure for LUM015.  Clinicians should be prepared for a possible hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to  occur during 
each administration  of LUM015. Standing orders should be in place in the event of a 
hypersensitivity or allergic reaction for immediate intervention  including administration of

12 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
12.1 Definitions  
12.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any  procedure 
specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. The severity of any possible AE observed will be classified per the grading established by t he Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0. 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce 
clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
12.1.2  Serious adverse  event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of 
causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it oc curred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a 24-hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disr uption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospa sm

 requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Events not considered to be serious adverse events are h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
• elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
12.1.[ADDRESS_506594]  (ADE)  
An adverse device effect (ADE) is an adverse event which is at least possibly related to the device.  
ADEs are not considered serious adverse events.  
12.1.4  Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs)  
Unanticipated a dverse device effect (UADE) is  any serious a dverse effe ct on he alth or safety or 
any life-threatening problem or deat h cause by [CONTACT_1282], a device, if that effect, problem, 
or death was not previously identified in nat ure, severity, or degr ee of i ncidence in the 
investigati on plan or appli cation, or any other unanticipated serious prob lem associate d with a 
device that rel ates to the rights, safety or wel fare of subjects.  
12.1.5  E
xpectedness  
Adverse events (AEs) and adverse device effects (ADEs)  can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected'.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse event  or adverse device effect  
Expected AEs and ADEs  are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent  or use of the device. For the purposes of this study, an AE or ADE is 
considered expected  when it appears in the current AE/ADE  list, the Investigator’s Brochure,  the 
Instructions For Use  or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected adverse event  or adverse device effect  
For the purposes of this study, an AE or ADE  is considered unexpected when it varies in nature, 
intensity or frequency from information provided in the current AE/ADE  list, the Investigator’s 
Brochure, the Instructions F or Use,  or when it is not included in the informed consent document 
as a potential risk.   
12.1.6  Attribution  
Attribution is the relationship between an  adverse event or serious adverse event and the study 
treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
• Definite – The AE  or ADE  is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE  or ADE  is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE  or ADE  may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE  or ADE  is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
• Unrelated - The AE  or ADE  is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
Final determination of relatedness will be made by [CONTACT_1689], who will integrate all data, including investigator’s assessment  of relatedness.

15 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
A full description of the data analysis is included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
15.1 Analysis Populations  
• Safety (SAF) Population : the safety populat ion includes all subjects who received study 
drug (LUM015). 
• Modified Intent To Treat (mITT) population: includes the subjects in SAF , but excluding 
subjects who are not able to be imaged with the LUM Imaging System . The mITT 
population will be used as the primary analysis population for the three co -primary efficacy 
endpoints and efficacy analysis of the secondary endpoints.  
• Per-Protocol Population: Includes mITT subjects who complete all study evaluations and 
are without any major protocol deviations  that may impact data collection or efficacy 
analysis. A sensitivity analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will  be 
conducted using the per-protocol analysis set. 
15.[ADDRESS_506609] for diagnostic performance evaluation (sensitivity and 
specificity)  
We propose to use a hierarchical approach to determine the truth standard as therapeutic shaves were taken only when the LUM imaging system signaled positive for potential residual tumor. The highest truth standard is whether pathology finds cancer in a tissue shave removed from the area that was imaged in the cavity. When a shave does not exist, then whether tumor is found in a re -
excision surgery is considered as the truth standard. When neither a shave nor a second surgery exists for a given orientation that was imaged, the margin assessment of that orientation is used as 
truth standard. Error! Reference source not found.  sho
 ws a schematic for determination of the 
truth standard.

Figure 6: Definition of truth standard to evaluate the LUM Imaging System diagnostic performance.  
When the therapeutic shave is not available and the follow -up surgery is performed, only the 
pathology from the first -time re -excision at the tissue/orientation level will be used for hierarchical 
sensitivity/specificity evaluation.  
The orientation of the tissue removed during a re -excision is typi[INVESTIGATOR_402090] a positive margin was identified from the initial surgery. 
However, there will be instances in which the orientation of the tissue removed during a re -excision 
is not specified. In the cases of unclear orientation of the tissue removed during the re -excisions, 
the orientations with positive margins will be used as positive/negative with cancer as suggested by [CONTACT_402123] a mastectomy is performed as a follow -up surgery and no cancer found in the mastectomy 
specimen, all the orientation will be considered as cancer negative for truth standard. If 
mastectomy is performed and cancer is found and no indication of orientations where cancer has been found, the orientation in which a positive margin was identified in the initial lumpectomy will be considered as cancer positive for truth standard unless otherwise noted.  
When a therapeutic shave and re- excision are not available for an orientation, the prior margin of 
the resected tissue of the corresponding orientation will be used as ground inferred truth for 
evaluation.

𝐻𝐻0:𝑝𝑝 ≤ 3% 
The alternative hypothesis is that the true percentage of patients in whom at least one LUM -guided 
shave removed after the SOC procedure contain cancer as confirmed by [CONTACT_402125] 3%:  
𝐻𝐻𝐴𝐴:𝑝𝑝>3% 
where p is the true percentage of pa tients in whom at least one therapeutic shave removed after the 
SOC procedure contain cancer as confirmed by [CONTACT_402126].  
The hypothesis will be tested using an exact Binomial test at a one -sided significance level of 
2.5%. The true proportion 𝑝𝑝  will be estimated along with a one -sided 9 7.5% exact confidence 
interval.  
Lower bound selection for removal of residual cancer endpoint 
To choose the success cr iteria for the proportion of patients who have residual cancer found in a t 
least one  LUM -guide d shave, we used published results for estimates of local recurrence before 
and after adjuvant radiation, assuming that most local recurrences are a consequence of unresected 
cancer during the initial surgery. The meta -analysis conducted on approximately 28,000 patients 
to support the consensus guideline for margin in 2014 from SSO -ASTRO, reported an overall 
recurrence rate of 5.3% for patients undergoing lumpectomy and receiving whole breast radiation therapy (including patients with positive and negative margins) [1]. Other investigators have 
published local recurrence rates for patients with negative margins at 10.2% without a radiation boost, while 6.2% for those wit h radiation boosts [ 2]. Based on this data, we estimate that radiation 
addresses approximately 50% of residual cancer, but not all . Our Phase C results show s a 
proportion of 26/230 or 11.3% [95%  CI: 7.5% -16.1%], supporting the lower bound selection of 
this endpoint. 
Sample size for residual cancer removal  
Our preliminary analysis of the Phase C exploratory data indicated that LUM dete cted residual 
cavity cancer in 1 1% of patients (26 /230). To power the study, we are using a slightly more 
conservative assumption of a ~9 % true percentage of patients in whom at least one therapeutic 
shave has cancer confirmed by [CONTACT_56618]. With this assumption, enrolling [ADDRESS_506611] for proportions at a 1 -sided  significance level of 2.5%, will have 90% power 
to declare the percentage of patients in whom at least one therapeutic shave has cancer confirmed 
by [CONTACT_402127] 3%.

truth result (sensitivity) and those with a negative ground truth result. 
L
ower bound selection for sensitivity and specificity endpoints 
Data from the Phase C Feasibi lity Study  show ed pathology margin assessment sensitivity to 
predict cancer in the cavity of ~40% . However, this pathology assessment is done several days 
after the surgery  and can lead to second surgeries. Because the LUM Imaging System provides the 
additional benefit of assessing the cavity in real -time, a lower bound  for instrument sensitivity > 
40% is proposed as the success criterion for this hypothesis- tested endpoint. We expect the 
sensitivity to be similar to that observed in the Phase C study of 67% [95% CI: 56%-79%]. 
The Phase C data shows that at the current speci ficity performance of 70% [95% CI: 68% -73%] , 
an average of 1.1 additional shaves were removed guided by [CONTACT_402128], accounting 
for ~10% of all the total resected tissue.  We selected a lower bound for specificity of 60%  to ensure 
that similar performance in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_402092]. Also , with this 
lower bound, a Youden Index > 0 will be demonstrated to indicate non- random diagnostic 
performance. 
Sample size for sensitivity 
Assuming a sensitivity of 60% , obtaining [ADDRESS_506613] 
for proportions at a 1 -sided  significance level of 2.5%, will have 90% power to declare the lower 
bound of sensitivity > 40%. Sample size for specificity 
Assuming a specificity  of 65%, ob taining [ADDRESS_506614] for proportions at a 1 -sided  significance level of 2.5%, will have 90% power to declare the 
lower bound of s pecificity  > 60%. 
15.3.3  Study sample size, event -driven design, and overall study power  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_402093]- primary endpoints as 
outlined above. The efficacy endpoints will be assessed in the patients who undergo LUM -guided

 from the event counting process will be accessible to the DSMB which will then inform Lumicell 
personnel on whether the targeted number of events ha s been reached or if enrollment needs to 
continue. 
At this sample size, the power for the sensitivity endpoint is 90%, for specificity is 99% and for 
removal of residual cancer is 96%. Thus, the overall study power is 90% x 99% x 96% = 86%.  
Revision note : As of the release of revision [ADDRESS_506617] positive events. We now intend to enroll up to 450 subjects in this study . 
15.3.4  Overall Primary Hypotheses  
The overall primary hypothese s for the primary en dpoints is 
𝐻𝐻0𝑝𝑝 (null ):𝐻𝐻0or 𝐻𝐻01𝑠𝑠 or 𝐻𝐻02𝑠𝑠   versus   𝐻𝐻1𝑝𝑝 (alternative): 𝐻𝐻1 and  𝐻𝐻11𝑠𝑠 and  𝐻𝐻12𝑠𝑠 
The removal of residual cancer endpoint will be tested at a one- sided significance level of 2.5% . 
Sensitivity and specificity endpoints will be tested at a two -sided significance level of 5%. 
15.4 Statistical Methods  
15.4.1  General considerations  
All analyses will be performed under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards using a prespecified 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). All analyses will be conducted and t ables and listings generated 
using Statistical Analysis System (SAS®) Version 9.4 or highe r. Graphics may be prepared with 
SAS Version 9.4 or higher; R version 3.1.2 or higher (R Core Team (2014)), SigmaPlot 12.3 or higher (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, [LOCATION_004]). 
15.4.2  Demographic  and baseline characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteri stic including: age, race and ethnicity, menopausal status, 
mammographic breast density, palpability, cancer histologic type, tumor size, node positive 
patients, and tumor receptor status (ER/PR/HER2), and baseline body mass index (BMI) calculated from wei ght and height will be summarized for the study sample. Statistics for 
continuous variables will include mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, maximum and sample size for the overall sample and for subgroups, and two- sided 95% CI of the mean 
difference between (control and study arms) and subgroups. Binary variables will be described with frequencies and percentages for the overall sample.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_402129]. 
15.4.3  Efficacy analyses  
Three co-p rimary  endpoint s 
• Ratio of patients who have  residual cancer found in at least one Lumicell- guided shave 
(also known as therapeutic shave ) among all patients  randomized to the device arm. 
• Diagnostic performance of instruments measured two separate endpoints as sensitivity  and 
specificity  in a per- tissue basis.

b. Proportion of subjects with pathology- positive margins after standard of care breast -
conserving surgery for whom additional LUM Imaging System -guided shaves resulted in 
pathology- negative margins among patients with positive margins. Note: This endpoint 
also estimates the potential reduction in re -excision surgeries following standard of care 
breast -conserving surgery that resulted from a positive SOC margin.  
c. Proportion of subjects with pathology- positive margins after standard of care breast -
conserving surgery for whom additional LUM Imaging System -guided shaves resulted in

 • Adverse events coded per MedDRA guidelines 
• Adverse events by [CONTACT_402131] (sorted by [CONTACT_402132]).  
All adverse events will be evaluated and assigned the “expectedness” by a Lumicell representative 
as described in the study  plans or protocols and will be reported accordingly. 
Two safety analyses sets will be completed: one for all the patients injected  with LUM015 across 
all the Lumicell clinical studies (see Error! Reference source not found.  in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan document), and another one for just the breast cancer patients . 
15.4.5  Exploratory Data Analyses  
Patient reported outcome  measures (PROM s) will be reported as an exploratory endpoint. Also, 
the type of tissue found in therapeutic shaves will be reported as an exploratory endpoint. 
In this pr otocol, the definition of positive margins is described in section Error! Reference source 
not found. . In addition, Lumicell will collect margin distance information such that alternative 
definitions (e.g. DICS on ink) can be tested in an exploratory manner. 
15.4.6  Missing or spurious data  
During Lum icell-guided imaging, when there is not enough tissue to be removed (e.g. too close to 
skin or too close to the chest wall) no LUM image shall be recorded because it does not generate 
an actionable result.  
In the case where the LUM Imaging System indicates that a therapeutic shave needs to be removed 
but the surgeon decides not to follow this guidance, the reason for not doing so will be recorded in the patient’s CRF or during imaging. These instances are considered as a protocol deviation . There 
are other cases when the shavings reach protocol limits so no shaving will be performed. In these 
cases, the data will be included in the performance evaluation as is - that is no Lum -guided shave -
taken will be considered as no removing of cancer or positive margin.  However, they will be 
considered as a detection if there are cancer in the re- excision or if there are positive margins on 
the corresponding orientations.  
In occasions, a cavity image may be recorded from an unintended region or the image may be 
deemed as low quality (blurry, out of focus, etc.). For example, the surgeon realizes that he/she placed the device in the wrong location within the cavity after recording an image. Since the LUM software does not allow to overwrite saved images, this situation will be documented, the image will be excluded from the analysis.

 Appendix A:  Method for removing, orienting, inking and naming the main specimen and shaved 
cavity margins.   
The methods described below are adapted from Cabioglu, et al. (ASO 14:1458- 1471; 2007). This 
method applies to both palpable and non- palpable breast masses.  
As described below, stitching of the main specimen (#2) and protocol specified  nomenclature of 
the resected  specimen (Appendix B) are protocol requirements to support data integrity.  Non-
compliance with these elements will be considered protocol deviations. Inking of the specimen 
and shaves, and stitching of the shaves are recommended per protocol but non- compliance is not 
considered a protocol deviation if the process negatively interferes with the institution’s standard 
procedure.   
Procedure: 
1. Surgeon performs surgery attempting to obtain grossly negative margins in the main 
specimen.  
2. Surgeon places orientation stitches at the superior and lateral orientations of the main specimen immediately after it is removed from the patient. It is extremely important 
to maintain the orientation of the specimen relative to the lumpectomy cavity to be able to correlate LUM images of the cavity with pathology examination of the 
main specimen . 
3. Surgeon inks all surfaces of the main specimen using a differently colored ink for each orientation. Lumicell will provide an inking kit to facilitate this process. This kit 
is not part of the LUM Imaging System. 
4. Surgeon may elect to remove additional tissue shaves based on palpation of the specimen or lumpectomy cavity walls, x -ray imaging of the main specimen (mainly 
for non- palpable masses) , visual inspection , intraoperative frozen sections, standard 
of care shaves, or comprehensive shaves. If additional shaves are removed, the shaves 
must be labeled according to the orientation it was removed from and the number of 
additional tissue shaves taken from that orientation (see Appendix B f or naming 
convention of resected tissue). For example, the first additional tissue from the medial 
orientation  should be named as “medial 1”.  
5. If additional shaves are removed, the surgeon should ink as many surfaces as possible 
maintaining the same color used for a given orientation in the main specimen. For 
example, if the superior orientation of the main specimen is inked yellow, then the margin side of a tissue from the superior orientation should be inked yellow. 
6. When  any additional shaves are removed , the margin side should be marked with a 
stitch and should be inked per institution’s standard procedure.

 Appendix B:  Guidelines for naming of resected tissues  
Two (2)  standard naming conventions, described as “Naming Convention B1” and “ Naming Convention B2 ” in Table B below, shall  
be used by [CONTACT_402133].  As the shaves 
are removed during the surgery, a record will be created in the operating room by [CONTACT_402134] L umicell guidance  (accor ding to column  B1).  The pathologists must not have access to th e record  
using naming convention B1  until after the pathology assessment has been recorded. The sample s shall be labeled according to Naming 
Convention B2 before transfer from the operating ro om to pathology, and this naming convention shall follow the samples through the 
final pathology report.

 Appendix C: Handling and sectioning SOC and therapeutic shaves  
All cavity shaves, whether an SOC or therapeutic, will be handled and processed in the same 
manner as described below.  
1. Section the shave in its entirety  perpendicular to its long axis at  approximately every [ADDRESS_506623]  in a cassette for paraffin embedding. Note:  if the sections are 
small enough, more than one section can be placed in a single cassette.  
3. Prepare a paraffin embedded block from each cassette (e.g., if there are three cassett es for 
a single shave, this should result in three different blocks).  
4. Prepare at least one histopathology slide for margin assessment from every single block. 
5. Determine the margin status for each histopathology slide from a shave  and record results. 
6. Report results  using naming convention B2 , as described in Appendix B.  
 
Example: 6 total shaves are removed from a patient and sectioning of the shaves generates 3 blocks 
each. The total number of slides for margin assessment would be: 6 shaves x 3 blocks/shave  = [ADDRESS_506624] cancer  CL0007r08

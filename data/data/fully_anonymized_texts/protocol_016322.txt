4		PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  Study Title Use of a Computerized Decision Aid for Prenatal Aneuploidy Screening Funder • National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), NIH, Grant #UL1TR001111 • UNC Department of OBGYN Cefalo-Bowes Grant (internal funding) Clinical Phase Phase II Study Rationale • All women should be offered aneuploidy screening or testing in each pregnancy • Screening and testing options are complex • Decision aids have been shown to improve knowledge and decrease decisional conflict with healthcare decisions, including aneuploidy screening • Prior decision aids which have been evaluated for aneuploidy screening did not include the newest screening option of cell-free DNA Study Objective(s) Primary  • To evaluate whether use of the computerized decision aid is noninferior than an abbreviated visit with a genetic counselor in increasing patient knowledge Secondary • To evaluate whether use of the computerized decision aid is noninferior than an abbreviated visit with a genetic counselor in 
[ADDRESS_529234] • To evaluate whether use of the decision aid in addition to genetic counseling improves patient knowledge and decisional conflict over genetic counseling alone • To examine test chosen for aneuploidy screening  Test Article(s) (If Applicable) A computerized decision aid was developed within a tablet-based application, available in Spanish and English, at a 10th grade reading level, to aid in patient education surrounding aneuploidy screening and testing options Study Design  Unmasked randomized controlled trial Subject Population key criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Inclusion Criteria • English and Spanish-speaking pregnant women • Undergoing genetic counseling for indication of aneuploidy screening • Ages 18-[ADDRESS_529235]’s participation will last for the duration of the study visit (approximately 45 minutes). 
[ADDRESS_529236] 12 months. Study Phases Screening Study Treatment Follow-Up    (1) Screening: Women scheduled for genetic counseling for indication of aneuploidy screening will be approached regarding eligibility and willingness to participate prior to their scheduled appointment.  (2) Intervention: Participants will be randomized either to use the above-described decision aid prior to genetic counseling or to genetic counseling alone. (3) Follow-up: None after study visit Efficacy Evaluations (1) Knowledge: A 12 question modification of the MSSKQ questionnaire will be used to assess knowledge (2) Decisional conflict: A validated low-literacy decisional conflict scale will be used to assess decisional conflict  Pharmacokinetic Evaluations N/A Safety Evaluations N/A Statistical And Analytic Plan (1) Primary outcome: Noninferiority of knowledge will be assessed graphically and with Wilcoxon Rank-Sum (2) Secondary outcomes: knowledge and decisional conflict scores will be assessed with Wilcoxon Rank-Sum  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN Participants were provided with contact [CONTACT_71722] [INVESTIGATOR_419670]. No safety concerns are anticipated.

Following this, they will met with the genetic counselor as scheduled; following this appointment, they will again complete the same assessment. Additionally, prior to and following meeting with the genetic counselor, women in group 2 will be asked whether they would or did find it helpful to meet with a genetic counselor.  Genetic counselors will be educated prior to study initiation that their counseling should not be modified based on group assignment; generally, women < 35 years old received abbreviated counseling on aneuploidy screening and testing options and those ≥ 35 years old received more extensive counseling. Within ACMG guidelines, all screening tests are available to all women; cost information and insurance coverage information on available tests will also be provided prior to final decision making. Women will then undergo their screening or testing modality of choice. All study participation and completion of initial screening will be completed within the single encounter. 3.2 Allocation to Treatment Groups and Blinding (if applicable) Via a coin-flip algorithm within the decision aid application, women will be randomly assigned to group 1 (control group) or group 2 (decision aid group) 3.3 Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Subjects Study duration for each participant is limited to the single study visit during which patients are enrolled, complete questionnaires, and complete genetic counseling. 200 participants will be enrolled. This is anticipated to take approximately 12 months. 3.4 Study Population English and Spanish-speaking women with a singleton gestation at less than 22 weeks who are scheduled to meet with a genetic counselor at one of three prenatal diagnosis clinics for a discussion of aneuploidy screening and testing options are eligible for participation.  
11		Exclusion criteria include: multiple gestations, prior abnormal ultrasound in the current pregnancy, or prior aneuploidy screening in the current pregnancy.

Those who agreed to participate were asked to arrive early for their appointment to be enrolled in the study. 4.2 Intervention Following informed consent, the app was accessed and a study ID assigned. Via a coin-flip algorithm within the app, women were randomly assigned to group 1 (control group) or group 2 (decision aid group). As it was not pragmatic for this study, randomization assignment was not blinded. Investigators were not involved in developi[INVESTIGATOR_419671]. All women completed an initial demographic and knowledge questionnaire immediately following randomization via self-administered assessments within the app.  Study flow is described in the below figure. Women randomized to group [ADDRESS_529240] assessments. Following this, they met with the genetic counselor as scheduled; following this appointment, they again completed the same assessment. Additionally, prior to and following meeting with the genetic counselor, women in group [ADDRESS_529241] Completion/ Withdrawal procedures Participants are instructed to inform their enrolling research study personnel should they desire to withdraw and participation could be terminated at that time.

[ADDRESS_529242] deviation of 3 questions; to achieve 80% power with a 2-tailed alpha of 0.05, 92 women would be needed in each arm. Assuming a 7.5% fall-out rate from women with nonviable pregnancies, 100 patients were required in each arm for a total enrollment of 200 women. 6.2 Statistical Methods Baseline demographics • Mean age - Wilcoxon rank sum • AMA as categorical variable - chi2 • Race/ethnicity - Fisher exact • Mean GA - Wilcoxon rank sum • GA<14 wks as categorical - chi2 • Insurance status - Fisher exact • Employed yes/no - chi2 • Education level - fisher exact • Religion - Fisher exact • Prior GC - chi2 • Planning invasive testing - Fishers exact • Mean knowledge score on enrollment - Wilcoxon rank sum  Results 1. Compare control group following genetic counseling to intervention group following decision aid o Mean knowledge - Wilcoxon rank sum o Mean decisional conflict - Wilcoxon rank sum o Planned test - Fisher exact

2. BACKGROUND 
2.1 Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer (AIPC) 
Prostate adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy in American men and the second leading 
cause of cancer related deaths [1, 2].  According to the SEER database, 42% of patients have either metastatic disease or will eventually progress following local therapy. Whereas androgen ablation therapy is an effective initial modality, androgen independence and progression of disease eventually occurred in all patients with metastatic prostate cancer [3, 4].  The utilization of second line hormonal agents is generally associated with low response rates, and has no documented survival benefit.   
Chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_298791] (AIPC) since the 1970s.  The initial studies showed low response rates and high toxicities.  Recently, however, with the development of new agents targeting prostate cancer both on the cellular and 
molecular level, promising results have been emerging. The agents, including docetaxel, mitoxantrone, estramustine, vinblastine and etoposide, either as a single agent or as a combination therapy, have produced significant PSA responses in 30-80% of patients with median progression free survival of 3-5 months [5]. Chemotherapeutic agents also showed benefits in pain control, and/or quality of life, with estramustine/docetaxel combination showing the most promise. In our prior trial of thalidomide in a similar patient population, the median time to treatment failure was 2.[ADDRESS_364580] on survival. Therefore, new therapeutic modalities are needed in patients with advanced AIPC. 
 2.2 BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) BAY 43-[ADDRESS_364581] been treated with this drug with tolerable side effects [6].   
Activation of the Ras oncogene signaling pathway is considered to be an important mechanism by [CONTACT_298827].  Raf kinase is a protein involved in the Ras signal transduction pathway.  Ras regulates several pathways which synergistically induce cellular transformation, including the 
  7Raf/MEK/ERK cascade and the rac and rho pathways [7, 8].  In particular, Ras activates the Raf/MEK 
pathway by [CONTACT_298828], where Raf initiates a mitogenic kinase cascade.  Activated Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK.  Activated ERK then translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and modulates gene expression via the phosphorylation of transcription factors.  Thus activation of Raf kinase, via activation of Ras, is thought to play an important role in carcinogenesis. 
In particular, B-Raf, a serine/threonine kinase, has been shown to be activated in a number of human 
tumor types including melanoma, ovarian and papi[INVESTIGATOR_44330] [9-15].  A survey of 43 cancer cell lines showed that all B-Raf mutations resided in exons 11 or 15.  Remarkably, 80% of these B-Raf mutations represent a single nucleotide change of T-A at nucleotide 1796 resulting in a valine to glutamic acid change at residue 599 (V599E, exon 15) in the CR3 domain (ATP binding and substrate recognition) which in turn confers constitutive kinase activity [10, 11]. 
In Vitro  Activity 
The ability of BAY 43-9006 to inhibit a number of kinases was evaluated [6].  The in vitro  biochemical and

In vitro  kinase assays demonstrated that BAY 43-9006 is a potent inhibitor of wildtype and mutant (V599E) 
B-Raf and c-Raf Kinase isoforms in vitro  [6].  In addition, BAY 43-9006 did not inhibit human EGFR or 
Her2 kinases at 10 PM.  Nor were PKC- Į, PKC-ȕ, PKC-Ȗ, and PKA (rat, rabbit and bovine sources) kinase 
activity inhibited in vitro .  BAY 43-[ADDRESS_364582] p59 (bovine) Fyn kinase

the adenosine A3, dopamine D1, and muscarinic M3 receptors with IC 50 of 1.6 PM, 2.0 PM, and 3.1 PM, 
respectively.  BAY 43-9006 did not inhibit MEK-1, ERK-1, EGFR, HER2/neu, c-met, PKA, PKB, Cdk-1/cyclin B, pim-1, [COMPANY_004] 3-b, CK-2, PKC- Į (r), PKC- ȕ (r), PKC- Ȗ at concentrations as high as 10 μM.  In 
summary, BAY 43-9006 showed 100-fold more selectivity for Raf kinase relative to other target proteins. 
BAY 43-9006 also inhibited in vitro  several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are involved in tumor 
progression; human VEGFR-2, murine VEGFR-2, murine VEGFR-3, murine PDGFR- ȕ, Flt-3, c-KIT, and 
p38Į (MAPK family).  In cellular assays, BAY 43-9006 was found to be a potent inhibitor of human and 
murine VEGFR-2, murine VEGFR-3, and murine PDGFR- ȕ receptor phosphorylation [6]. 
VEGF and PDGF receptors are involved in the mechanism of tumor angiogenesis [16, 17].  PDGF 
receptors may also play a role in patients with chronic myeloproliferative cancers [18].  Flt-3 is important in acute myelogenous leukemia [13] and c-Kit plays a critical role in gastrointestinal stromal tumors [19].

In this table, compound efficacy is expressed as percent tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and is calculated as ((1-(T/C)) *100, where T and C represent the mean tumor size in the Treated and Control groups respectively at the first measurement after the end of treatment.

These receptors also signal through the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway. 
In human tumor xenografts, MDA-MB-231 (breast) and Colo-205 (colon), there was a dramatic reduction 
of tumor neo-vascularization [6].  Recent data also indicated that inhibition of c-Raf may promote cell death in endothelial cells as a downstream event of VEGFR-2 stimulation [20]. 
Taken together, data suggests that BAY 43-9006 may be of therapeutic value not only in human tumors 
containing Ras gene mutations, but also in tumors over-expressing growth factor receptors in the 
Ras/Raf/MEK pathway, and by [CONTACT_298829]-vascularization through inhibition of VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and/or PDGFR- ȕ. 
  10The ability of BAY 43-9006 (or its tosylate salt, BAY 54-9085) to be combined with paclitaxel, irinotecan, 
gemcitabine, or cisplatin was evaluated in preclinical in vivo  models.  In these studies, the focus was to 
evaluate if the co-administration of BAY 43-[ADDRESS_364588] the tolerance or anti-tumor efficacy of the ‘standard of care’ agent. The general health of mice was monitored and mortality was recorded daily. Tumor dimensions and body weights were recorded twice a week starting with the first day of treatment. Treatments producing greater than 20% lethality and/or 20% net body weight loss were considered ‘toxic’.  The results of these combinability analyses are summarized below:

are combined, the incidence of greater than grade 3 treatment emergent skin toxicity (e.g. hand-foot syndrome and “dermatology/skin reaction”) for an initial dose of 400 mg bid and 600 mg bid, was 0% and 30%, respectively. Anti-tumor activity was observed in both Phase 1 and 2 studies. 
 
Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetic studies in humans shows that BAY 43-9006 undergoes metabolism to a few primary 
metabolites, some of which may be active [6].  No data are available at this writing to describe the 
pharmacokinetics of repetitive dosing of BAY 43-[ADDRESS_364593] bioavailability of BAY 43-9006; it is in fact recommended to be administered with or around meals.  Approximately 19% of dose is excreted in urine and 76% in feces.   
2.3 Rationale 
Specific to prostatic adenocarcinomas, strong epi[INVESTIGATOR_298792] 
a significant difference in expression levels between normal and tumor cells.  Furthermore, an inverse correlation between Ras positivity and degree of differentiation and survival has been reported [21, 22].  Such findings suggest that functional activation of wild-type Ras might contribute to prostate tumorigenesis. 
Bakin and colleagues [23, 24] demonstrated that manipulation of Ras-related signaling affected sensitivity 
to hormonal interventions in vitro.  This pathway is involved in the mediation of responses to a number of 
growth factors as well angiogenic factors.  More recently, Fu and colleagues have been able to demonstrate that when Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is transfected into C4-2B cells (malignant prostatic rat epi[INVESTIGATOR_298793] a metastatic phenotype), invasion was decreased and development of lung metastases in animal models was no longer seen suggesting that this pathway is associated with suppression of tumor metastases [25].   
In addition to activity on Raf-associated signaling, BAY 43-[ADDRESS_364594] human 
VEGFR-2, murine VEGFR-2, murine VEGFR-3, murine PDGFR- ȕ, Flt-3, c-KIT, and p38 Į (MAPK family).  
Multiple reports in the available literature report VEGF expression in most prostatic carcinomas [26] and expression of VEGFR may relate to migratory and invasive ability.  Furthermore, in vitro models have suggested that activation of p38-MAPK active pro-apoptotic pathway activity in prostate cancer [27].  While the remainder of the targets listed above have not been well characterized in prostate cancer, their impact on the angiogenic cascade is of interest in prostate cancer as several groups have proposed manipulation of angiogenic signaling as a therapeutic target [28]. 
Given the potential role of the Ras-Raf pathway in metastatic prostate cancer in addition to the known in 
vivo and in vitro activity of the agent, we propose the execution of a phase II trial to measure the efficacy of this compound in preventing progression of AIPC. At this time little data exists for this agent in AIPC.  This study represents the first formal inquiry into this matter.

4. TREATMENT PLAN 
This study will be executed in a two-stage optimal design as described by [CONTACT_298835] [29].  In the first 
stage, [ADDRESS_364607] 22 patients, 7 or fewer are able to be progression free at the 4 month evaluation, then no further patients will be enrolled and the study will close to accrual.  Should 18 or more patients remain progression free at 4 months, BAY 43-9006 will be considered worthy of further development in clinical trials.  If 8-17 patients are progression free at 4 months, the study set will be considered insufficient.  Under the null hypothesis (30% progression free at 4 months), the probability of being able to stop accrual after [ADDRESS_364608] been evaluated at 4 months is 67%. 
The study was originally designed to have a two-stage design with [ADDRESS_364609] stage were inadequate to justify accrual to the second stage. However, per amendment D, waiver of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_298794]. 
 
4.1 BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) Administration  
At the outset of the study, the patient will be admitted to the inpatient service for a period of approximately 
24 hours to complete research studies including biopsies and PK measurements.  Otherwise, treatment 
will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in 
Section 6.  Appropriate dose modifications for BAY 43-9006 are described in Section 5.  No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_37342]’s malignancy. 
BAY 43-9006 is supplied as 200-mg tablets and is administered orally twice a day. Patients are to swallow

5. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
Toxicities will be described using CTCAE v3.  The following adjustment will only apply if the toxicities 
reported are attributed by [CONTACT_298836] 43-[ADDRESS_364611] been found to be intolerable to the patient, the dose of BAY 43-9006 may be reduced by 200 mg/day (i.e.200 mg qAM and 400 mg qPM as the initial reduction). 
For Grade 2 toxicity 
For nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, maintain dosing with symptomatic treatment.  The dose of 
BAY 43-9006 may be repeated if emesis occurs within 30 minutes of taking the tablet(s) OR all the tablets are seen in the emesis. 
For persistent nausea, vomiting or diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_298795] (intolerable) to the patient, reduce dose by 200 mg/day (i.e.200 mg qAM and 400 mg qPM as the initial reduction). 
For other grade 2 toxicities, the dose does not need to be reduced unless side effects become 
intolerable to the patient. 
If patients are receiving 200 mg bid at the time of occurrence/recurrence of toxicity, change the 
schedule of administration to 200 mg qd.  Reductions below this dose/schedule will not be allowed. 
Patients with intolerable or limiting toxicity while taking 200 mg qd will be removed from study.  .   For Grade 3 clinical toxicity, or Grade 3/Grade 4 metabolic/hematologic toxicityHold BAY 43-[ADDRESS_364612] weekly until toxicity improves to  Grade 1 or pre-treatment 
baseline.  Grade 3 metabolic toxicities which can be corrected to  Grade 1 or pre-treatment 
baseline within 48 hours will not necessitate a dose reduction. For Grade 4 metabolic toxicity or 
Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity the dose of BAY 43-9006 will be reduced by 200 mg/day. .  
Treatment will be discontinued in patients who experience toxicity  grade 3 or 4 that does not resolve 
to  grade 1 or baseline within 3 weeks. 
If patients are receiving 200 mg bid at the time of occurrence/recurrence of toxicity, change the 
schedule of administration to 200 mg qd.  Reductions below this dose/schedule will not be allowed. 
Patients with intolerable or limiting toxicity while taking 200 mg qd will be removed from study. 
For Grade 4 clinical toxicity 
Patients who had clinical grade 4 toxicity (except pulmonary embolism without significant hypoxia 
and hemodynamic instability) will be taken off study permanently.

5.1.1  Recommended antihypertensive therapy Patients requiring additional antihypertensive therapy while on BAY 43-9006 should be 
started on a beta blocker, diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).  Doses should be advanced as needed until the patient is unable to tolerate the antihypertensive medication due to side effects.  If further medication is required a beta-blocker should be initiated and doses advanced. Calcium channel blockers should be avoided. 
5.1.2 For severe hypertension, hypertensive urgency/emergency BAY 43-9006 should be held and the patient should be admitted.  An EKG should be 
obtained and, if appropriate, cardiology should be consulted.  Inpatient therapy for hypertension should be initiated. 
5.1.3 Therapy may be continued if the hypertension is successfully controlled with 
additional medication.  However, for hypertension that persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_298796], therapy will be held as described above.  If therapy is held for 4 weeks, the patient will be taken off of study. 
5.2        GI Perforation (NOS) 
If a patient experiences GI perforation while on study of any grade, patient must be taken

Availability 
BAY 43-9006 is an investigational agent supplied to investigators by [CONTACT_298839] (DCTD), NCI. 
Agent Ordering  
NCI-supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized designees) at 
each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that the agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained).  Completed Clinical Drug Requests (NIH-986) should be submitted to the PMB by [CONTACT_6791] ([PHONE_5107] or mailed to the Pharmaceutical Management Branch, CTEP, DCTD, NCI, [ADDRESS_364617] Form (DARF).   BAY 43-9006, as an oral self-administered investigational agent, will be properly accounted for, handled, and disposed in accordance with CCR Policy # Clin-1 “Policy on Documenting, Handling and Disposing of Oral Investigational Agents that are Self-Administered by [CONTACT_298840].”  The Standard Operating Procedure # Clin-1 “Standard Operating Procedure for Conducting and Documenting Drug Accountability for Oral Investigational Agents that are Self Administered by [CONTACT_298841]” identifies all activities associated with drug accountability for orally self administered 
investigational agents.  Study drug may be repackaged by [CONTACT_298842]. and dispensed in light-resistant HDPE containers that contain up to a 28-day supply of BAY 43-9006..  Patients will be instructed to document on a study diary the daily intake of BAY 43-9006, including the time the dose is taken, and whether or not any doses are missed.  They will bring the study diary and any unused drug to their clinic appointments.  Clinic staff will (1) collect all “old” [i.e., empty bottle(s), partial bottle(s) or full bottle(s)] of study drug; (2) perform a capsule count and record the results on the approved CCR Pi[INVESTIGATOR_298797]; (3) dispense the partial and full bottle(s) of BAY 43-9006 to the patient.  Unused study drug is to be returned to the research nurse who will dispose of it according to the SOP. 
7. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
7.1 Tissue analysis for molecular endpoints  
Given the nature of this pharmacologic intervention, characterization of the actual biological manipulation 
will be critical in understanding the biological effects seen following administration.  Tissue samples will be analyzed to achieve this goal. 
The collection of correlative studies is designed to characterize a baseline molecular profile as well as a 
treatment-induced molecular profile.  Raf mutational analysis will allow for retrospective analysis of responsiveness in the presence or absence of mutations.  Proteomic analysis will provide profiles of signaling pathways pre-treatment and on treatment so as to understand how this agent affects a variety of 
  19important signaling cascades associated with its reported molecular targets.  In particular, primary 
endoints address key events in survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis which will affected either directly or downstream of Raf or VEGFR/PDGFR targets.  Pharmacokinetic anlaysis will provide insight into dosing efficacy as it realtes to both biological activity and clinical response. 
Correlative laboratory studies for this trial will be conducted in the Clinical Pharmacology Section of [CONTACT_15336] D. Figg at the NCI and by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Elise C. Kohn. All patients will have leukocyte collections (by [CONTACT_298843]) to evaluate for tumor and gene expression alterations related to drug therapy.  Patients with accessible disease will have tumor biopsies before and during treatment for molecular analysis described below.

Samples should be preserved in OCT according to the NCI/FDA clinical proteomics program SOP (appendix B).  Samples should be barcoded and stored in liquid nitrogen until the time of preparation for microdissection. 
Biopsy specimens will be used for tissue lysate array analysis in the proteomics laboratory (see 
section 7.2) for signal pathway profiling before and during treatment as well as Raf mutation detection via TLA. 
7.1.2. Bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_298798], attempts will be made to determine effect in

In limited series, bone marrow trephines and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_298799] 75% of cases using traditional histopathologic techniques [30].  Given the fact that patients often have bone as their sole site of metastasis and the relative difficulty of obtaining soft tissue biopsies for direct tumor sampling, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_298800] a powerful tool in assessing biological response both in the tumor and in the tumor microenvironment.  This question will be addressed using protein microarrays in conjunction with immunohistochemistry on these samples.

time points: immediately pre-dose, and at 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_364624]. William D. Figg will coordinate rapid acquisition and evaluation of patient samples.  The pharmacokinetic characteristics of BAY 43-9006 in patients with AIPC will be evaluated using the WinNonlin software (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA).  The maximum concentration, time to maximum concentration, the area under the curve extrapolated to infinity, and the apparent terminal half-life will be calculated.  Pharmacodynamic study will address any correlation in BAY 43-9006 concentration with disease response and/or toxicities.    
7.6  B-Raf mutation analysis It has recently been found that B-Raf is commonly mutated in human tumors.  To determine if BAY 43-
9006 preferentially inhibits tumors with mutant B-Raf, mutational analysis of B-Raf using the following paradigm:  
Initial screening for B-Raf mutation will be executed by [CONTACT_298846].  The most frequently 
observed mutation in B-Raf is the V599E [31] amino acid substitution.  [CONTACT_298853]’s group has developed a monoclonal antibody specific to this mutation (unpublished data).  Lysate arrays will be optimized with 
this monoclonal antibody and then will be used to assess expression of this BRAF mutation. .  Detection of this protein product will prompt allele specific PCR analysis of this region of the tumor genome using a recut from the tumor biopsies obtained for the protocol.  No germline analysis will be done.  Additionally, once a cohort of responders has been identified, genomic DNA will be extracted from tissue blocks for allele specific PCR in the other commonly mutated region, T1769A.

techniques (CT, MRI, x-ray) or as > [ADDRESS_364631] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
9.1.2 Non-measurable disease
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <20 
mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_364632] scan), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non-measurable. 
9.1.3 Target lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_47334]. 
9.1.4 Non-target lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Non-target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the maximum numbers per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non-measurable lesions.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
9.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 
4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered 
measurable. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified 
and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation 
  27by [CONTACT_30574] a treatment. 
Clinical lesions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x-ray.  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI.   These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_364633], abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols. 
Ultrasound (US).   When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, US should 
not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules.  US might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148]. 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation has not yet 
been fully and widely validated.  Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers.  Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in reference centers. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained. 
Cytology, Histology.   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and 
complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease. 
9.3 Response Criteria  
9.3.1  Evaluation of target lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions  Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions 
 Stable Disease (SD):   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started 
 
9.3.2 Evaluation of non-target lesions  
  28 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level 
 Incomplete Response/ Stable Disease (SD):  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits 
 Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions 
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, in such 
circumstances the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13387], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or study chair). 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_364634] response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria (see section 9.3.1).

& Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective progression, even after discontinuation of treatment. 
 
& In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status.

11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
The study was originally designed to have a two-stage design with [ADDRESS_364646] stage were inadequate to justify accrual to the second stage. However, per amendment D, waiver of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_298794]. 
 The primary objective of this study is to determine whether BAY 43-9006, when used to treat metastatic 
AIPC, is associated with having 50% of patients progression free at 4 months by [CONTACT_2085], radiographic and PSA criteria.  The secondary objective of this study is to determine the time to progression measured by 
  34clinical and radiographic criteria. If this is found to be the case, then this agent will be considered 
potentially useful when combined with other anticancer agents to be tested in later trials.  Data from previous trials of NCI patients with similar eligibility requirements demonstrated a 2.1 month median progression free survival when using thalidomide (n=63) [32].  Median progression free survival on ketoconazole alone is expected to be 4 months based on previous trials[33]. Ketoconazole is recognized as a standard therapy alterative to cytotoxic chemotherapy in the setting of failure of primary hormonal therapy with GnRH agonists and anti-androgen therapy.  The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group is currently sponsoring a phase III clinical trial comparing ketoconazole to the combination of estramustine and docetaxel.  Median progression free survival on ketoconazole alone is expected to be 4 months based on previous trials [34, 35].  Based on these results, it would be useful to demonstrate whether BAY 43-9006 is able to induce progression free survival in 50% of patients at the 4 month (approximately day 113 evaluation) time point. 
The study will be conducted as a two-stage optimal design (Simon 1989)[29]. Using alpha=0.10 and 
beta=0.10 as acceptable error probabilities, the trial will target 50% as the desirable proportion of patients who are still without progression by [CONTACT_2085], radiographic and PSA criteria at the 4th monthly evaluation (p1=0.50; see section 9.5.1 for details), and will be considered inadequate if only a fraction consistent with 30% are without progression by [CONTACT_79930] (p0=0.30). 
Initially, [ADDRESS_364647] not progressed as defined in Section 9.3 and 9.4 at the 4th evaluation (day 113, approximately), then enrollment will continue until [ADDRESS_364648] been found to be progression free at 4 months, then this will indicate an adequate progression free probability to be worthy of further consideration in future trials.  On the other hand, if 8-17 of 46 are progression free at 4 months, this will be considered insufficient.  Under the null hypothesis (30% progression free at 4 months), the probability of being able to stop accrual after [ADDRESS_364649] been evaluated at 4 months is 67%. However, under amendment D, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_298805], despi[INVESTIGATOR_298806]. The total set of [ADDRESS_364650] (retrospectively) or second stage of accrual.  
  
11.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
Based on previous efforts in recruiting patients with this disease onto trials at the NCI, it is anticipated that 
[ADDRESS_364651] be assessed for response to 
treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By [CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.] 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who received no 
study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  Patients in response 
categories 4-9 should be considered as failing to respond to treatment (disease progression).  Thus, an 
incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise definitions for categories 4-[ADDRESS_364652] selection 
Subjects treated on this study, will be individuals with metastatic prostate cancer, which has recurred (or 
persisted) after appropriate standard treatment.  Individuals of any race or ethnic group will be eligible for this study.  Eligibility assessment will be based solely on the patient’s medical status.  Recruitment of patients onto this study, will be through standard CCR mechanisms.  No special recruitment efforts will be conducted. 
12.2 Evaluation of benefits and risks/discomforts 
The potential benefit to a patient that goes onto study, is a reduction in the bulk of their tumor and 
improvement in their bony lesions, which may or may not have favorable impact on symptoms and/or survival.  Potential risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects, that are listed in the Consent Document (Please refer to http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html  to review the up-to-
date expected adverse event list for BAY 43-9006).  The procedure for protecting against or minimizing risks, will be to medically evaluate patients on a regular basis as described in Section 9. 
12.3 Risks to patients in relation to anticipated benefits 
12.3.1 For patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer, median survival is in the range 
of 12-18 months.  Potential risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects listed in section 6.  Please refer to http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html  to review the up-to-
date expected adverse event list for BAY 43-9006.   
12.3.2 Risk of serial biopsies: All care will be taken to minimize risks that may be incurred by 
[CONTACT_62564].  However, there are procedure-related risks (such as bleeding, infection and 
visceral injury) that will be explained fully during informed consent. If patients suffer any physical injury as a result of the biopsies, immediate medical treatment is available at the NIH’s Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.  Although no compensation is available, any injury will be fully 
  36evaluated and treated in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_298807]. 
12.4 Consent process 
Patients will meet with an associate or principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_298808], 
during the initial evaluation for this study.  During that meeting, the investigator will inform patients of the purpose, alternatives, treatment plan, research objectives and follow-up of this trial.  The investigator will then provide a copy of the IRB-approved informed consent document that is included in this protocol.  The patient will be allowed to take as much time as he wishes, in deciding whether or not he wishes to participate.  If a prolonged period of time expi[INVESTIGATOR_118382] (several weeks, as an example), it may be necessary to reassess the patient for protocol eligibility.  A copy of the signed informed consent will be placed in the patient's medical record and the original held in the Protocol Office. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_364653] a signed informed consent form and an on-study (confirmation of eligibility) 
form filled out and signed by a participating investigator before entering on the study. 
12.[ADDRESS_364654] be maintained on each patient treated on the protocol.  These 
records should include primary documentation (e.g.: laboratory report slips, X-ray reports, scan reports, pathology reports, physicians notes, etc.) which confirm that: 
12.6.1  The patient met all eligibility criteria 12.6.2   Signed informed consent was obtained prior to treatment 12.6.3  Treatment was given according to protocol (dated notes about doses given, 
complications, and clinical outcomes). 
12.6.4   Toxicity was assessed according to protocol (laboratory report slips, etc.) 12.6.5   Response was assessed according to protocol (X-ray, scan, lab reports, date noted on 
clinical assessment, as appropriate). 
12.6.6 Drug Accountability  
The unused BAY 43-9006 (partial bottles, empty bottles, and full bottles) will be returned for drug 
accountability at each clinic visit.  An oral study agent case report form will be used to document drug accountability for each patient on this study.  Unused agent, which is not returned to the patient for the next dose cycle, will be disposed of according to the Procedure of Disposal of Returned Oral agents. 
12.6.[ADDRESS_364655] (IRB) within 10 working days of the date of occurrence. Safety information from patients enrolled onto the study will be gathered and reported.  Any unusual toxicity will be explored for possible causative mechanisms.  The safety of the repetitive biopsy procedure will also be determined and reported. 
13.1  Any unanticipated or unknown treatment- or drug-related toxicity(ies) and life-threatening and 
lethal toxicity(ies) will be reported according to the DCT’s Guidelines for Reporting Adverse Drug Reactions to the Investigational Drug Branch ([PHONE_365]; Fax [PHONE_100]) within 24 hours, with a copy sent to the NCI-IRB.  All fatal events (NCI/CTEP grade V toxicity) will require a written report from the 
  37Principal or Associate Investigator will follow within [ADDRESS_364656] forms to: 
    Investigational Drug Branch 
    [PO_BOX]     Bethesda, MD [ZIP_CODE] 
Clinical Associates and/or senior staff should notify the Principal Investig[INVESTIGATOR_136]or [INVESTIGATOR_136] [PHONE_197] ([CONTACT_298854]), 
Bldg.10, Rm 12N226 of the occurrence of such toxicity.  
13.2 Adverse events listed in section 6 do not require ADEERS reporting except as otherwise 
mandated by [CONTACT_298850] (e.g., grade 3 with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], grade 4 or 5).  The occurrence of any new toxicity (not in the above list), regardless of grade, and all life threatening events (NCI/CTEP grade IV toxicity) will be reported to the Drug Monitor, Investigational Drug Branch, CTEP, and the NCI IRB within [ADDRESS_364657] form and for notifying the NCI’s Institutional Review Board. 
A summary of the ongoing study will be submitted to the NCI’s Institutional Review Board at [ADDRESS_364658] using the CTEP study summary form.  The status reported will be submitted and presented at upcoming NCI meetings as requested

41  Appendix B: NCI/FDA Proteomics Program Standard Operating Procedure for Tissue Core 
Collection- Needle Biopsy – Cryopreservation in OCT 
 
Principle:
Core needle biopsies are used to sample tissue from a specific, defined location.  These biopsies may 
consist of normal, pre-malignant and malignant tissue due to the multi-level tissue sample that is obtained.  This type of sample is ideal for studying the micro-tumor environment. 
Rapid freezing of the sample is required to prevent degradation of the proteins or RNA.  Optimal Cutting 
Temperature (OCT) compound is an alcohol polymer that is liquid at room temperature and a solid at –[ADDRESS_364662] the tissue and provide a medium for cryo-sectioning. 
 
Materials:
Cryomolds  (Sakura Finetek Ca.t # 4728) 
OCT (Sakura Finetek Cat. # 4583) Dry ice Ultra cold freezer (-70
0 to -800C)  
Needle: 16 or 18 gauge Permanent marker Sterile forceps 
Sterile Glass slides 
Aluminum foil or 50ml Falcon tubes   
Procedure:
1. Prepare all supplies prior to the biopsy procedure to avoid delay once the specimen has been 
obtained. 
2. Label the handle and the front surface of the cryomold with the sample or patient’s identifying 
information. 
3. Perform core needle biopsy. 4. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_298810] a sterile glass slide. 5. Fill cryomold about 1/[ADDRESS_364663] on top of the biopsy, completely covering the sample. 9. Ensure the sample is level and freeze immediately in dry ice. 10. Store wrapped in aluminum foil or in a 50ml Falcon tube at –70
oC. 
 
Note:   
Do not lay the biopsy on frozen OCT and cover it with liquid OCT.  The OCT will not fuse and will split into 
two sections when cutting the frozen tissue sections. 
 
[ADDRESS_364664] 
the frozen section at the end of the slide. 
3. Two tissue sections from the same biopsy may be placed on the same glass slide if space 
permits. 
4. Do not allow the tissue section to air on the slide.  Freeze immediately on dry ice or at –80oC. 
 
Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_298811] 
1. Ship slides/tissue in OCT on dry ice Monday through Thursday only.  
2. Tissue should be embedded in OCT prior to shipment.  Refer to procedure steps 5-10. 3. Seal slide box in a plastic bag with dessicant (such as Drierite crystals).  Seal tissue in a 50ml 
polypropylene Falcon tube, wrap in aluminum foil or place in a plastic bag. 
4. Place dry ice on top of the plastic bag containing the slides/tissue. 5. Place any special instructions/inventory/shippi[INVESTIGATOR_298812]. 6. Seal the box with tape.   7. Ship to:

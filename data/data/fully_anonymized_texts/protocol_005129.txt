APB Study : Api[INVESTIGATOR_223722]  
A study to determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of api[INVESTIGATOR_223723].  
 
1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the 
research hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
 
Obesity is now the leading health problem of the 21st century. Weight reduction by [CONTACT_223767]. There has been a substantial increase 
in the use of bariatric surgery to provide sustained weight loss and thus a reduction in the medical 
comorbidit ies that are associated with obesity. However, because these procedures may alter the 
anatomical and physiological aspects of the gastrointestinal system, there is a possibility of altered 
pharmacokinetics to medications particularly when taken orally. Fur thermore, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_223724] 50 to 75% of their estimated excess body mass approximately one to two years following 
surgery. This successful therapeutic outcome of the surgery may be causing long term changes in the 
pharmacokinetics that  are independent of any direct anatomical or physiologic changes induced by [CONTACT_223768].   
  
Physicians and surgeons are very interested in  oral anticoagulants for this special patient population. To 
date, there is no approved dosing for the obese patien t (especially when considering surgical

 intervention such as bariatric surgery).  VTE is one of the top two causes of morbidity and mortality in 
the bariatric surgical patient. In the ninth edition of the Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of 
Thrombosis guideline published by [CONTACT_223769] ( 1), it is reported that 
virtually all bariatric surgical patients have at least a moderate risk of VTE, with many patients at high 
risk. ( 2) The approach to VTE prophylaxis used by [CONTACT_223770] a combination of non -
invasive and pharmacologic techniques, including sequential compression devices, anti -embolic 
stockings, anticoagulation, and early ambulation. Traditionally VTE prophylaxis has been accomplished 
with subcutaneou s injection however with the introduction of new oral anticoagulant medications many 
practitioners are using these anticoagulants without demonstration of effectiveness in this population.  
 
The Johns Hopkins Center for Bariatric Surgery is interested in co nducting a pharmacokinetic study 
of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]  (an oral anticoagulant with FDA approval for use of VTE prophylaxis and treatment)  in the 
obese adult population  to determine if bariatric surgery influences api[INVESTIGATOR_9612] . More interesting 
would be to see how the dose may need to change pre - vs. post -bariatric surgery (this will be important 
for physicians as more and more patients undergo this procedure worldwide and many  may require 
anticoagulation in their future healthc are).  
 
2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
 
Specific Aim 1: To determine the pharmacokinetics of api[INVESTIGATOR_223725] a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m2 or greater.  
 
Hypothesis 1a:  Obese patients prior to bariatric surgical intervention, compared to normal 
weight historical controls, will have a decrease in both Cmax and AUC when given a single dose 
of 5 mg of apix aban.  
 
Specific Aim 2: To determine the pharmacokinetics of api[INVESTIGATOR_223726] -en Y gastric by[CONTACT_6476] (RYGB) or Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy 
(VSG) at 1, 6, and [ADDRESS_269227] -op.  
 
Hypothesis 2a: Patients who have recently undergone RYGB surgery ( [ADDRESS_269228] -op) will 
have a decrease in both the Cmax and AUC , relative to pre -op values, when given a single  dose 
of 5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  
 
Hypothesis 2b:  Patients who have recently undergone VSG surgery ( [ADDRESS_269229] -op) will have 
a decrease in both the Cmax and AUC , relative to pre -op values,  when given a single dose of 5 
mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]. The magnitude of the decrease in Cmax  and AUC will be less than that seen in 
RYGB patients.  
 
Rationale: Anatomic alteration of the GI tract will immediately reduce absorption in all post -
operative bariatric patients. In RYGB patients, the attenuated small bowel and altered bile acid 
compositi on will lead to decreased absorption of the drug, whereas in sleeve gastrectomy 
patients prolonged gastric emptying may affect pharmacokinetics.

 These findings will be important when considering the use of api[INVESTIGATOR_223727] p erioperative VTE prophylaxis in the bariatric population, both in the 
acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_223728].  
 
Hypothesis 2c:  After undergoing bariatric surgery, patients at 6, and [ADDRESS_269230] an increase in Cmax and AUC , relative to pre -op values,  when given a single  dose of 5 mg 
of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  
 
Hypothesis 2d:  After undergoing RYGB , patients at 6, and [ADDRESS_269231] a greater 
increase in both Cmax and AUC , relative to pre -op values, than VSG patients relative to pre -op 
values when given  a single  dose of 5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  
 
Rationale: Patients who are [ADDRESS_269232] a 30-50% 
decrease in excess body weight. This decrease in body weight reduces volume of distribution of 
drug, potentially affecting Cmax. Results of the published Phase [ADDRESS_269233] -bariatric 
surgery when compared to pre -op values.  
 
Findings of the Phase I study (3,4)  
An open -label, parallel -group, non -randomized, single -dose s tudy in healthy male and female  
subjects was conducted to assess the effects of body weight on the pharmacokinetics of a 
single  10 mg dose of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]. Following screening, patients were enrolled in one of three 
groups: low  body weight (≤50kg, N=18), normal body weight (65 -85kg, N=18) or high body 
weight (≥120kg,  N=19).  
 
Compared to normal body weight:  
• There was a 27% increase in Cmax and 20% increase in AUC in patients with low body  weight  
• There was a 31% decrease in Cmax and 23% decrease in AUC i n patients with high body  
weight  
 
The effect of RYGB vs . sleeve gastrectomy on long -term pharmacokinetics is difficult to predict 
because of the opposing effects of greater weight loss with reduced absorption in the RYGB 
patient.  
 
These findings will be i mportant when considering api[INVESTIGATOR_223729] -term 
post -op bariatric patients who may require anticoagulation for stroke, myocardial infarction, 
atrial fibrillation or orthopedic procedures such as hip or knee replacements. (5, 6)  
 
Specific Aim 3: To measure the effect of api[INVESTIGATOR_223730] (chromogenic anti -Xa 
activity assay)  in bariatric surgical patients pre -operatively then at 1, 6, and [ADDRESS_269234] -
operatively.

 Hypothesis 3a:  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_223731], the pharmacodynamics response 
(measured with a chromogenic anti -Xa activity assay ) will not differ by [CONTACT_726] 10% in 
comparing pre -surgical response to that at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery .  
 
Rationale: The changes in pharmacokinetics should not lead to a different concentration -
response relationship in the chromogenic anti - Xa activity of individual patients following 
dosing with api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 5 mg. Were there to be a significant change in pharmaco dynamics, other 
factors due to the altered anatomy or substantial weight loss would need to be invoked to 
explain that altered relationship.

 3. Background (briefly describe pre -clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research)  
 
Defining Venous Thromboembolism  
VTE includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT), blood clots that form in the deep veins of the 
body, and pulmonary emboli (PE), blood clots that form in the deep vei ns of the body and then 
break free and enter the arteries of the lungs. VTE affects all races, ethnicities, both genders 
and all age groups.  (1) 
 
There is a fine balance between clot formation and fibrinolysis. Normally these two physiologic 
states are in dynamic equilibrium preventing patients from bleeding or clotting excessively. 
Numerous factors affect this delicate balance. These factors can be grouped into three broad 
categories, also known as Virchow’s triad (after the German physician Rudolf Virc how ):  
 
1. Vascular injury (endothelial damage)  
2. Activation of blood coagulation (hypercoagulability)  
3. Venous stasis  
 
Figure 1 Virchow’s Triad  
 
 
  
Burden of Venous Thromboembolism in the Bariatric Surgical Patient  
VTE and its sequelae constitute one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119888] -operative surgical patients. In the [LOCATION_002] alone, an estimated 
300,000 to 600,000 (1 to 2 per 1,000) patients each year are diagnosed with VTE, and 60, 000 to 
100,000 die of VTE. (3) Among people who have had a DVT, one -half will have long -term 
complications such as swelling, pain, discoloration, and scaling in the affected limb (post -
thrombotic syndrome). ( 7) Spyrpoulos et al completed a healthcare claim s analysis on the 
economic burden of VTE and found that the cost of VTE ranges from $7594 to $16, 644 per 
patient. ( 8) This equates to a total annual cost of [ADDRESS_269235] Physicians ( 1), it is reported that virtually all bariatric surgical patients have at 
least a moderat e risk of VTE, with many patients at h igh risk. (9, 10 ) Despi[INVESTIGATOR_223732], there exists no FDA -approved or universally accepted protocol for pharmacologic VTE 
prophylaxis in morbidly obese patients.

today is a combination of non -invasive and ph armacologic techniques, including sequential 
compression devices, anti -embolic stockings, anticoagulation, and early ambulation. In 2000, 
Wu and colleagues surveyed members of the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric 
Surgery (ASMBS) and found that w hile virtually all of those who completed the survey practiced 
some form of DVT prophylaxis, nearly half nonetheless experienced patient mortality due to PE. 
They found considerable variation among surgeons with respect to preferred means of 
prophylaxis.  (11) Because of this, best practices for VTE prophylaxis in bariatric surgical patients 
are unfortunately based not on evidence but on the experience and opi[INVESTIGATOR_223733]. Furthermore, there is little published evidence to direct primary care  and specialty 
physicians on the medical management of post -bariatric patients who years following their 
weight loss surgery might require oral anticoagulation prophylaxis or therapy.  
 
Narrative Summary of Methods of VTE Prophylaxis  
 
Chemoprophylactic VT E Prevention  
To date there remains no class [ADDRESS_269237] Physicians recognizes 
three main drug classes: heparin, including low -dose unfractio nated heparin (UFH) and low -
molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux (anti -factor Xa inhibitor), and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  
 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_223734] (50 -100 mg daily). It acts on the 
cyclooxygenase -[ADDRESS_269238] not measured up (12 ) and the 
American College of Chest and Physicians Guidelines do not recommend the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_223735] V TE for any patient population. (13 ) 
 
Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)  was first discovered by [CONTACT_223771] (a second year medical student 
at Johns Hopkins University) in 1916. (10) It is a naturally occurring polysaccharide and is 
derived from either porc ine intestine or bovine lung. UFH binds to antithrombin (AT) III and 
enhances AT to inactivate factors IIa, Xa, IXa, and XIIa. This then prevents the conversion of 
prothrombin to thromb in and fibrinogen to fibrin. (14 ) UFH consists of polysaccharide 
molecu lar chains of varying lengths (5000 to 40,000 Daltons). Heparin is administered 
intravenously or subcutaneously but is inactivated in the GI tract. It binds non -specifically to 
various plasma proteins and therefore causes an unreliable dose -response. It ha s a rapid onset 
of action and a short half -life. Intravenous administered heparin is measured by [CONTACT_223772] (aPTT).  
 
Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH)  are obtained by [CONTACT_223773] 8000 Daltons (15 ). 
LMWH also binds to and enhances the activity of AT, but has a preferential and longer lasting

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_269239] on factor Xa and does not selectively bind to specific proteins like heparin. As a result this 
drug is more predictable and has less inter -patient variability, and has a longer duration of 
action when compared to heparin and the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] D VT is significantly reduced. (16 -
17) LMWHs do not require monitoring of either aPTT or INR.  
 
There are numerous varieties of LMWH based on their molecular weight and include 
Enoxaparin, Dalteparin, Nadroparin, Parnaparin, Certoparin. Bemiparin, Reviparin and  
Tinzaparin. Enoxaparin is the most commonly used and studied LMWH in the bariatric 
literature. It is derived from the intestinal mucosa of pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107].  
 
Fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide factor Xa inhibitor. Fondaparinux inhibits factor Xa 
by [CONTACT_223774] (AT), a blood protein responsible for inactivating 
enzymes in the clotting cascade. When fondaparinux sodium is introduced into the circulatory 
system it binds to AT and effectively neutralizes its activity. This in turn dis rupts the blood 
coagulation cascade and prevents thrombin formation. (18 ) Fondaparinux has no direct effect 
on thrombin. It is administered subcutaneously and has a long half -life. While this medication 
cannot be used in patients with renal impairment, a p otential advantage of fondaparinux over 
LMWH or unfractionated heparin is a greatly reduced risk for heparin -induced 
thrombocytopenia (HIT).(19 ) 
 
Whereas fondaparinux directly prevents DVT formation by [CONTACT_223775] a specific 
protein, enoxaparin in directly prevents DVT formation by [CONTACT_223776]. (20 ) 
 
New Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) are currently available for prophylaxis against venous 
thromboembolism in patients undergoing total hip or knee rep lacement surgery. Dabigatran 
etexilate (Pradaxa) is a direct thrombin inhibitor which inhibits both free and fibrin -bound 
thrombin. Randomized controlled trials have shown that dabigatran is as effective in the 
prevention of VTE in total hip replacement.(2 1) Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is an orally activated 
direct factor Xa inhibitor (4 hours after the dose is taken and the factor Xa activity does not 
return to normal for 24 hours thus onc e daily dosing is possible). (22 ) This drug has FDA 
approval for the initi al treatment of DVT and PE and for the prevention of recurrent DVT and 
PE. Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (Elquis): Like Rivaroxaban, Api[INVESTIGATOR_34212] a direct factor Xa inhibitor. Api[INVESTIGATOR_223736] 2011 and is used there for preventing venous thromboembol ism 
in hip and knee surgery. This drug was initially approved  in the [LOCATION_002] for reducing the 
risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular  atrial fibrillation. (23 ) More 
recently, it has received FDA approval for the prophylaxis  of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which 
may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in adult patients who have undergone hip or knee 
replacement surgery.  
 
A recent review and meta -analysis of these new oral anticoagulants has concluded that they 
were equally as good as enoxaparin but did have a higher bleeding tendency. The drugs did not 
differ significa ntly for efficacy and safety.  (24)

a major bleeding complication attributed  to api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (as opposed to minor issues, which need 
not remove the participant from the study) . 
 
g. Description of what happens to participant s receiving therapy when study ends or if a 
participant ’s participation in the study end s prematurely.  
If the subject discontinues early, will we conduct an exit interview with final assessment.

 • Participants currently receiving any type of anticoagulation or blood thinning medications, 
including heparin, low molecular weight heparins, Plavix, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], NSAIDS  
• Participant who is taking any of the ex cluded medications (see Table 2  above)  
 
6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.  
 
Drug procurement, handling, accountability and destruction will be carried out by [CONTACT_223777]. Administration of the drug will be completed by [CONTACT_223778]. These nurses will be trained and familiar with the prot ocol.  
 
We chose api[INVESTIGATOR_223748], eliminating the need for subcutaneous 
injection of anticoagulation prophylaxis, and has a new indication in orthopedic surgery for 
DVT. Administration of a 5 mg single does is expected to result in similar exposure to that 
observed in patients treated with 2.5 mg twice daily for the prevention of VTE following 
elective knee or hip replacement.  
 
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non -FDA 
approved indica tions or if doses or routes of administration or participant  populations are 
changed.  
 
The dose of api[INVESTIGATOR_223749] -approved dose for VTE 
prophylaxis and will be given by [CONTACT_223779]  (orally) .  It is labeled for VTE 
prophylaxis in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement, but not in those whose VTE risk is 
only obesity and not in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.  Safety information can be found 
in the FDA -approv ed package insert.  
  
c. Justification and safety information if non -FDA approved drugs without an IND will be 
administered.  
 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_223750]. This study is not intended to assess clinical 
outcomes for obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery who take a single dose  of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], 
but rather is a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparison of absorption and 
elimination of api[INVESTIGATOR_223751]. after bariatric surgery.  Api[INVESTIGATOR_223752] [ADDRESS_269244] 
been well tolerated in previo us studies in healthy volunteer s. (25, 26, 27) Therefore, a single 5 
mg dose of api[INVESTIGATOR_223753].   Safety 
information  can be found in t he FDA -approved package insert.

7. Study Statistics  
 
a. Primary outcome variable . 
To determine the durability or change in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of api[INVESTIGATOR_223754] a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m2 or greater following one of two bariatric 
surgical procedures  (pre-operative versus post -operative vertical sleeve gastrectomy or  Roux -
en-Y gastric by[CONTACT_223781]) . 
 
b. Secondary outcome variables . 
1. To compare/contrast the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of api[INVESTIGATOR_223755]. VSG.  
 
2. To determine how the pharmacokinetics of the  drug may differ when there is significant 
post -operative surgical weight loss (>40% estimated excess body weight) [ADDRESS_269246] suboptimal weight loss following bariatric surgery (< 
40% of estimated excess body  weight) . 
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis.  
We propose to study 15 subjects in each arm (RYGB vs. VSG) and use them as their own 
controls. We have accounted for loss to follow -up (even with a 36% ( 5 in each group) drop -out 
rate, we would have enough subjects (1 0 per group) to demonstrate a 36 % change in AUC with 
an alpha error of 0.05 and a  beta error of 0.2 (Power of 80%). If there is no loss to follow -up and 
all patients remain in the study, this will allow us to demonstrate a 2 9% change in AUC with an 
alpha error of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.2.  
 
These calculations were calculated based on the following data  from Upreti et al. : Ratio of 
geometric mean point estimated for high body weight (>120 kg)  vs. normal body weight for C max 
= 0.692 (0.586, 0.818) and AUC (INF) = 0.77 (0.652, 0.912).  
 
Routine pharmacokinetic data will be determined, including C max, Tmax and AUC for each subject 
at each dosing time, and compared within subjects and between subje cts and between groups. 
Factor Xa activity will be compared to api[INVESTIGATOR_223756].  
 
d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
While we do not expect to have any serious adverse events related to the administration of a 
single dose of 5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_223757], we will interrupt the study and report 
to the IRB if 10% or more of our first 12 subjects  suffer a serious adverse event "definitely

Page 16 of 26 
 related"  or "probably related" to the administration of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].   In such a case, we will not 
resume the study until the investigators, the sponsor, and the IRB are satisfied that there are 
alternative explanations for the events not related to api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], or the study procedures are 
altered to reduce the risk of such events for future participants.   After the first 20 subjects, if 
there is ever a point where 10% or more of the subjects suffer a serious adverse event either 
"definitely" or "probably" related to api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], the same approach will be taken.  
 
8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, th eir major and minor risks and expected frequency.  
 
The only risks related to pharmacokintectic and pharmacodynamics studies are minor bleeding 
and/or bruising at the IV insertio n site and the possibility of vasovagal reactions  to blood draws.  
 
The risks as sociated with u se of api[INVESTIGATOR_223758]:  
 
Bleeding:  As with other anticoagulants, subjects administered with api[INVESTIGATOR_223759].  
 
Stroke:  Stroke has been reported occasionally in studies of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]  (multiple dosing studies) . 
However, given that this is a single dose study – the likelihood of such a complication is rare. As 
part of good clinical practice, the investigators will remain vigil ant. 
  
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
To minimize the risks we will use experienced phlebotomists  from the CRU to place the venous 
catheters for blood drawing or to draw the blood via venipuncture if preferred by [CONTACT_1560].   Those drawing the blood will be familiar with the possibility of vasovagal reactions, 
and will have the subject lay down with legs elevated if the subject becomes symptomatic.  The 
patients will be monitored for a full [ADDRESS_269247] protected.  
 
WOMEN OF CHILD -BEARING POTENTIAL (WOCBP)  
 
Sexually active Women of Child -Bearing Potential (WOCBP) must use an effective method of 
birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized.  
 
Before study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of  avoiding pregnancy 
during study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The 
subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.

pregnancy test is positive, the subject must not receive api[INVESTIGATOR_223760].  
 
In addition, all WOCBP should be i nstructed to contact [CONTACT_223782] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study 
participation.  
 
ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the sub ject’s written consent to participate 
in the study through [ADDRESS_269249] be reported to B ristol Meyers 
Squibb (BMS)  Worldwide Safety.  
Adverse Events  
• An Adverse Event [AE] is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or wors ening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorabl e and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  
• The causal relationship to s tudy drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AEs). The causal relationship can be one of the following:  
− Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the 
AE. 
− Not Related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration 
and the AE.  
• The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.  
• Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicit ed during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not 
be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse events).  
Serious Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Ev ent (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caus ed death if it were 
more severe)

 • requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE *: 
below for exceptions)  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based on appropriate medical and scientific 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention ( e.g., medical, surgical) to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include but are 
not limited to intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
- Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or non -pathogenic) via the study 
drug is an SAE.  
Although pregnancy, overdose, and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events 
must be handled as SAEs.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
In this study, the following adverse events are to be reported to BMS, regardless of whether these 
reports are classified as serious or unexpected.  
- Potential or suspectived  cases of liver injury including but not limited to liver test abnormalities, 
jaundice, hepatitis or cholestasis.  
 
 
*NOTE:  The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
− A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8610] 24  hours that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an “important medical event” or a life -threatening event)  
− Elective surgery planned before signing consent  
− Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
− Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, routine 
colonoscopy)  
− Medical/surgical admission other than remedying ill health state that was planned before study 
entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases  
− Admis sion encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and 
requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason)  
Serious Adverse  Event Collecting and Reporting  
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -
specified procedures. Al l SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within 30

Application Number: IRB00035495  
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_269250] be collected that relate to any later protocol -
specific procedure (such as follow -up skin biopsy).  
The investigator should report any SAE occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related 
to study drug or protocol -specified procedure.  
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of 
seriousness.  
If the investigator be lieves that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy, or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of th e SAE Report Form.  
SAEs, whether related or unrelated to the study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS within 
[ADDRESS_269251] be recorded on the SAE Report Form; Pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form.  
SAE Email Address: Worldwide.Safet [EMAIL_4094]  
SAE Fax Number: [PHONE_188]  
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up SAE 
reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its inte nsity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes 
available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or designee) using the same 
procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
SAE Reconciliation  
The investigator will reconcile the clinical database SAE cases transmitted to BMS Global 
Pharmacovigilance (GPV&E). Frequency of reconciliation will be  every three months  and once prior to 
study  database lock. BMS GPV&E will e -mail upon request from the investigator, the GPV&E 
reconciliation report. Requests for reconciliation should be sent to [EMAIL_177] . The 
data elements listed on the GPV&E reconciliation report will be used for case identification purposes. If 
the investigator determines a case was not transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the case will be sent 
immediately.  
Health Authority Reporting (US FDA IND)  
Investigators must adhere t o local Health Authority Reporting Requirements. For studies conducted 
under an investigator sponsored US FDA IND, provide details of the following:  
 
- Any event that is both serious and unexpected must be reported to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) a s soon as possible and no later than 7  days (for a death or life -threatening

 event) or 15  days (for all other SAEs) after the investigator’s or institution’s initial receipt of the 
information.  
- BMS will be provided with a simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed with the FDA. SAEs 
should be reported on MedWatch  Form  3500A, which can be accessed at:

Email: [EMAIL_178]  
Non -Serious Adverse Events  
A nonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.  
Non -Serious Event Collecting and Reporting  
The collection of non -serious adverse event (NSAE) information should begin at initiation of study drug. 
Nonserious adverse event information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in period 
or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.  
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become 
serious. Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause int erruption or discontinuation of study 
drug, or those that are present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.  
Nonserious Adverse Events are provided to BMS via annual safety reports (if applicable), and interim or 
final study reports.  
Laboratory Tes t Abnormalities  
The following laboratory abnormalities should be captured and reported as appropriate:  
- Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
- Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subj ect to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted  
- Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective 
therapy.

 It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than the laboratory term will be used by  [CONTACT_35867] (eg, use the term anemia rather than low hemoglobin value).  
Laboratory test abnormalities are provided to BMS via annual safety reports (if applicable), and interim 
or final study reports.  
Pregnancy  
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study subject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product exposure, including during 
at least [ADDRESS_269253] will be permanently 
discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for subject safety).  
The investigator must immediately notify [EMAIL_179] of this event via the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form within [ADDRESS_269254] 
unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (eg, x -ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up 
procedures should be considered if indicated.  
Overdose  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that is 
considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be reported as 
SAEs.  
Other S afety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, 
x-rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are required by [CONTACT_12695], should also be recorde d as a nonserious or serious adverse event, as appropriate, and reported 
accordingly.  
 
c. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
 
There is the risk that information about you may become known to people outside this study.

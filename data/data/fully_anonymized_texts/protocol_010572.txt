You are being asked to join a research study.   Participating in research is different from 
getting standard medical care. The main purpose of research is to create new 
knowledge for the benefit of future patients and society in general.   Research studies 
may or may not benefit the people who participate.   
Research is voluntary, and you may change your mind at any time.   There will be no 
penalty to you if you decide not to participate, or if you start the study and decide to 
stop early.   Either way, you can still get medical care and services at the University of 
Kansas Medical Center (KUMC).     
This consent form explains what you have to do if you are in the study.   It also 
describes the possible risks and benefits.    Please read it carefully and ask as many 
questions as you need to, before deciding about this research.   
You can ask questions now or anytime during the study.   The researchers will tell you if 
they 
receive any new information that might cause you to change your mind about 
participating.   You may be asked to sign a new consent form if this occurs.   
This research study will take place at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) 
with Neil Segal, MD as the researcher.   About 28 women will be in the study at KUMC.   
Why  am I being asked to take part in this study?
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have frequent knee 
symptoms.
Why  is this study being done?    
Osteoarthritis of the knee (KOA) is the most common cause of disability in older adults.
Osteoarthritis involves a loss of cartilage, which acts like a cushion between your bones 
as well as changes in the bones of joints. Once the joint cartilage is gone, the body 
does not produce new cartilage.   Joint damage can contribute to pain. 
Currently, treatment for pain associated with knee osteoarthritis includes exercise.   
However, exercise at a medium- to high-intensity level can be a problem for people with 
knee pain. Because exercise is a common treatment for knee pain but many people 
experience pain during exercise, researchers hope to find a safer and more effective 
exercise 
method to strengthen the muscles around the knee.

Protocol: HTS
Both aerobic exercise and resistance exercise are recommended for the treatment of 
people with knee pain. However, pain can be a barrier to participating in exercise at a 
moderate or vigorous intensity. Electrical stimulation of muscles holds potential to allow 
effective exercise to be completed at tolerable intensities.
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is the use of very low electric 
currents produced by a device to stimulate the nerves, to treat pain. Neuromuscular 
electrical stimulation (NMES) uses low electrical current to cause muscles to contract.
By [CONTACT_56761], we hope to learn if a hybrid training system (HTS), using a 
combination of NMES and walking, is effective in strengthening muscles in people with 
knee pain, aching or stiffness.
What is being tested in this study?
This study will assess whether electrical stimulation of muscles during walking twice 
each week for 3 months improves strength and relieves pain.How long  will I be in the study?
Your participation in this study is expected to last about 12 weeks ([ADDRESS_921881] 48 hours), and will include up to 26 study visits. 
What will I be asked to do? 
If you decide to join the study, you will be asked to read 
 and sign this consent form 
before any study procedures take place.   
If you are eligible to be in this study, you will be assigned, using a random number 
generator (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin), to one of these two groups (50% chance):
•Electrical stimulation with Hybrid Training System
•Electrical stimulation with TENS
You will be asked to participate in walking exercises while wearing one of the two 
devices used in this study (TENS unit or NMES unit). Tests will also be performed of 
your mobility, strength, and pain perception.
The first and last visits (Baseline and Visit 25) will occur at the Clinical and Translational 
Science Unit (CTSU) located at [ADDRESS_921882], KS, [ZIP_CODE]
The exercise visits (Visits 1-24) will occur at the Kirmayer Fitness center located at the 
University of Kansas Medical Center, [ADDRESS_921883].
Below, you will find a schedule of events listing all procedures that will occur at each

The following is a description of each procedure listed in the previous table:
Informed Consent:   At the first study visit, the study will be explained to you. If you 
decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to read and sign this consent form 
before any tests or procedures can be completed. You will be given a copy of the 
signed informed consent.
Vital Signs: Your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing rate) will be 
taken.Questionnaire: You will be asked to complete a questionnaire about how your knee 
symptoms are affecting your daily activities.Urine sample: If there is a possibility that you could be pregnant, you will be asked to 
complete a urine pregnancy test before study participation.   If you are pregnant, you 
cannot be in this study.Questions about your pain: You will be asked questions about how much knee pain you 
are experiencing. Your pain will be measured on a visual pain scale (a chart 
representing your pain with numbers, with [ADDRESS_921885] 
pain imaginable). 
Test for threshold value of pain: Your pressure pain threshold will be measured using a 
hand-held pressure algometer. This is an instrument that presses on your skin and 
records the level when you report discomfort.

Protocol: HTS
Movement Assessment: You will be asked perform basic physical activities such as 
standing up from a chair, walking in a straight line and climbing stairs. You will be timed 
during each activity.
Strength Testing: Your strength in each leg will be tested before and after the 3 months 
of walking exercise training (explained below). Walking Exercise with Electrical Stimulation: You will be asked to perform walking 
exercise while low-energy electrical stimulation is being applied to your thigh. Electrical 
sensors will be placed on your upper legs before the training exercise begins. These 
sensors will deliver low-energy electrical pulses to your legs. You might experience a 
small amount of discomfort in your muscles after exercising with electrical stimulation. 
The study team member will lead you through a warm-up, the exercise and a cool-down 
over a 30-minute period.   These walking exercises will be performed at the Kirmayer 
Fitness Center at the University of Kansas Medical Center. You will be instructed to 
avoid excessive exercise outside of the study to avoid over-fatigue during the study 
period. 
Discuss side effects: You will be asked questions about how you are feeling and any 
side effects you may have experienced.
What are the possible risks or discomforts?
The study intervention may cause side effects or other problems. The researchers will 
be checking your medical information during the study to watch for side effects.   
However, you should tell the research team about anything that is bothering you or any 
changes in your health since the last visit.   The researchers may be able to take steps 
to reduce side effects.   You may experience none, some, or all of the side effects listed 
below. There may be other side effects or risks that are not yet known.

Strength Testing and Exercise Risks
You may experience sore muscles. This soreness is expected to be minimal and will go 
away in a short period of time. This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_681030].
As with any physical activity, there is a risk of experiencing high/low blood pressure, 
fainting, irregular heartbeat, or heart attack.   
Electrical Stimulation Risks
You may experience a small amount of discomfort in your muscles when they are being 
treated with electrical stimulation. This discomfort will go away once the electrical 
stimulation ends. If you are unable to continue to exercise because of this discomfort 
you can stop and the study team will lower the amount of electrical stimulation until the 
discomfort goes away. If the discomfort continues you will be withdrawn from the study. 
The adhesive patches on your legs used for the electrical stimulation may cause 
redness, rash, or itching like a heat rash. This risk will be minimized by a trained study 
staff member observing you, only wearing the patch during the walking sessions and 
using a new patch every [ADDRESS_921886] repeated skin reactions to the adhesive 
patches and are unable to continue the study exercise you will be withdrawn from the 
study.
Are there benefits to being in this study?   
You may or may not benefit from this study. If the study intervention is effective, you 
may develop greater muscle strength and/or experience less knee pain. Researchers 
hope that the information from this research study may be useful in the treatment of 
other patients with knee symptoms.
Will it cost anything to be in the study?   
The study will pay for all study-related medical services provided during this study. 
These services include the intervention, study visits, and study related tests and 
procedures such as the physical exams, exercise training, urine pregnancy test if 
needed, and all questionnaires as listed in this consent form. 
Any other medical visits and procedures you have outside of the study due to other 
standard of care treatments or other health issues are billable to you or your insurance 
through normal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56755]. Standard of care means necessary for the 
care of a medical issue as determined by [CONTACT_56772].
   Your insurance may not cover some or all of the standard care services if you are part 
of a research study. You may want to talk to your insurance company and review your 
specific benefits and coverage before deciding to participate. You will be responsible for 
normal co-pays, deductibles and non-covered services that are not the responsibility of 
the study. Some procedures require Pre-Certification from your insurance company,

We hypothesize that adolescents with severe obesity receiving GLP-1RA treatment following a short-term meal replacement induction period will demonstrate superior maintenance of initial BMI reduction 52 weeks following randomization compared to those assigned to placebo (primary endpoint) and that a higher proportion of those assigned to GLP-1RA treatment vs. placebo will maintain ≥5% BMI reduction from baseline to the 52-week time point (secondary endpoint).  Moreover, GLP-1RA treatment will result in superior maintenance of initial reductions of body fat (total, visceral, and subcutaneous), blood pressure, triglycerides/HDL ratio, inflammation, oxidative stress, postprandial glucose-insulin response, insulin resistance, and β cell dysfunction at 52 weeks.  Secondary Objectives: Investigate the mechanisms by [CONTACT_226374]-1RA treatment facilitates weight loss maintenance and identify predictors of response to treatment.  We hypothesize that compared to placebo, GLP-1RA treatment following a period of meal replacement will reduce appetite (and related hormones) and gastric emptying rate, and will increase satiety (and related hormones) and resting energy expenditure at 26- and 52 weeks following randomization.  Moreover, based on our preliminary work, we hypothesize that appetite (and appetite-related hormones) following the meal replacement period and female gender will be associated with superior weight loss maintenance with GLP-1RA treatment. Number of Subjects We anticipate having to consent/screen up to 250 subjects.

Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530] 1 Introduction/Summary  Long-term weight loss maintenance is seldom achieved by [CONTACT_881945], satiety, and energy expenditure in the post- weight loss setting.  Following a loss in body weight, peripheral and central mechanisms convey a sense that energy reserves have dwindled, activating a strong counter response to increase caloric intake.  Adolescents with severe obesity are not immune to the vexing issue of weight regain.  Indeed, only 2% are able to achieve and maintain clinically-meaningful weight loss with lifestyle modification therapy.  Therefore, novel treatment paradigms focused on long-term weight loss maintenance are urgently needed.  Pharmacotherapy has the potential to prevent weight regain by [CONTACT_881946]-regulatory mechanisms in the post- weight loss setting.  One of the most promising candidates is the glucagon like peptide-[ADDRESS_1233236] (GLP-1RA) class, which greatly enhanced weight loss maintenance following a short-term low calorie diet among adults with obesity.  The rationale for focusing on GLP-1RA treatment to prevent weight regain is supported by [CONTACT_881947]; many of which specifically address the biological adaptations known to induce relapse.  We have strong preliminary data demonstrating that GLP-1RA treatment reduces BMI in adolescents with severe obesity.  Moreover, we and others have shown that although meal replacement therapy (structured meals of known caloric content) can elicit robust short-term weight loss among adolescents with severe obesity, weight regain is a pervasive problem.  Therefore, in this clinical trial, our innovative approach will utilize GLP-1RA treatment to target weight regain following short-term meal replacement therapy in youth with severe obesity.  Participants who achieve ≥5% BMI reduction during the meal replacement phase will be randomized to GLP-1RA treatment or placebo for an additional [ADDRESS_1233237] dwindled, activating a strong counter response to increase caloric intake.2  Moreover, resting and non-resting energy expenditure decreases, further compounding the propensity for weight rebound.1  Adolescents with severe obesity (BMI ≥1.2 times the 95th percentile or BMI ≥35 kg/m2) are not immune to the vexing issue of weight regain as evidenced by [CONTACT_881948].4-7  Indeed, only 2% of adolescents with severe obesity are able to achieve and maintain clinically-meaningful weight loss with lifestyle modification therapy.4  These findings are sobering considering the relatively high prevalence of pediatric severe obesity (8% in the [LOCATION_002]), the rate at which it is increasing (fastest growing category of obesity), and the serious immediate- and long-term medical and psychosocial consequences of the disease.8, 9   The number and levels of cardiovascular risk factors are considerably higher in severe pediatric obesity compared to those associated with milder forms of obesity.  Approximately 85% of children and adolescents with severe obesity have at least one cardiovascular risk factor and 60% have two or more.[ADDRESS_1233238] higher levels of inflammation and oxidative stress,12 an adverse adipokine profile,13 and arterial endothelial activation.14  Moreover, longitudinal data uniformly implicate obesity in childhood as a strong predictor of future risk factor clustering and sub-clinical atherosclerosis in adulthood.15-17  Risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_36746] 2 diabetes is high in youth with severe obesity.18-26  The prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance in children and adolescents with severe obesity is notable, with estimates ranging from 4.5%-25%.27-[ADDRESS_1233239] alarming is the poor prognosis for youth afflicted with severe obesity.  Approximately 90% will have a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 in adulthood;[ADDRESS_1233240] promising strategies involves the use of the GLP-1RA class of medication, which was originally approved by [CONTACT_881949] 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control (weight loss is a beneficial “side effect”) and was recently approved for a weight loss indication.  Recently, GLP-1RA treatment was shown to greatly enhance weight loss maintenance (and produced additional weight loss) following a short-term low calorie diet among adults with obesity.34  Over 80% of those treated with GLP-1RA maintained ≥5% weight loss at one year.[ADDRESS_1233241]- weight loss counter-regulatory biological adaptations known to induce relapse by: 1) reducing appetite through activation of GLP-1 receptors in the hypothalamus; 2) enhancing satiety by [CONTACT_881950]; 3) beneficially altering insulin and leptin signaling in the hypothalamus and amygdala and inhibiting the reward pathways associated with hedonic eating behaviors; and 4) increasing energy expenditure.34-46  Through these various mechanisms, sustained weight loss has been achieved in the long-term (at least two years) using GLP-1RA treatment in adults.[ADDRESS_1233242] shown that although short-term meal replacement therapy (structured meals of known caloric content) results in clinically-meaningful weight loss (6% BMI reduction) among adolescents with severe obesity, weight regain is experienced by [CONTACT_881951]-term weight loss maintenance is poor.  The proposed clinical trial will take the next step and evaluate the weight loss-maintenance effectiveness of GLP-1RA treatment instituted immediately following a short-term meal replacement induction period among adolescents with severe obesity.  Importantly, this study will also allow us to: 1) examine the extent to which GLP-1RA treatment targets the various mechanisms responsible for weight regain (including tracking

Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_881952] a panel of appetite and satiety hormones), 2) investigate additional pleiotropic (weight loss-dependent and -independent) benefits of GLP-1RA therapy, and 3) identify predictors of successful weight loss maintenance with GLP-1RA treatment among adolescents with severe obesity. 1.[ADDRESS_1233243]-Met-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ala-  Val-Arg-Leu-Phe-Ile-Glu-Trp-Leu-Lys-Asn-Gly-Gly-Pro-Ser-Ser-Gly-Ala-Pro-Pro-  Pro-Ser-NH2 1.3 Clinical Data to Date Significance and Preliminary Work The significance of the proposed work lies in the seriousness and prevalence of the disease being targeted (pediatric severe obesity) and the improved outcomes that we hope to deliver (durable weight loss and risk factor management) in this population in need of safe, effective, and durable treatments.  The nature of severe obesity demands that appropriately-intensive interventions be initiated earlier in life, not later in adulthood when adiposity and co-morbidities have become entrenched.  Therefore, investigation into promising non-surgical treatments for pediatric severe obesity is desperately needed, considering the risks of surgery are not inconsequential56 and most will be unwilling to undergo this extreme treatment.  Weight regain continues to be a major hurdle in the field of obesity medicine.  Study #1: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_881932]-1RA Treatment in Severe Pediatric Obesity50 We conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_881933]-1RA exenatide on BMI (primary endpoint), cardiometabolic risk factors, and glucose tolerance in adolescents with severe obesity.50  Twelve adolescents (ages 9-16 years old) were recruited from MN-POC sites and enrolled in a 6-month, randomized, open-label, crossover, clinical trial consisting of two, 3-month phases: 1) a control phase of lifestyle modification and 2) a drug phase of lifestyle modification plus exenatide.  Participants were randomized to phase-order (i.e., starting with control or drug therapy) then crossed-over to the other treatment.  Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3-, and 6-months.  Results are shown in Table 1.  Compliance with the injection regimen was excellent (≥94%) and exenatide was generally well-tolerated.   The most common adverse event was nausea, which was experienced in 4/11 (all classified as mild).  Vomiting (3/11) and headache (3/11) were the second most common adverse events (all categorized as mild).  The encouraging preliminary findings (BMI reduction of 5% and improvements in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and beta cell function) prompted our group to conduct a follow up trial (see “Study #2”, below).

Study #2: Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Trial of GLP-1RA Treatment in Adolescents with Severe Obesity54 We performed a larger study with a more rigorous design (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a three-month open label extension) to evaluate the effects of exenatide on BMI and cardiometabolic risk factors in adolescents with severe obesity.54  Twenty-six adolescents (age 12-19 years) were enrolled.  All patients received lifestyle modification counseling and were equally randomized to exenatide or placebo injection, twice per day.  The primary endpoint was the mean percent change in BMI measured at baseline and three-months.  Twenty-two patients completed the trial.  Results are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2.    Figure 1. Percent Change in BMI during the Randomized, Placebo-Controlled and Open Label Phase  Of note, during the open label extension, BMI was further reduced in those initially randomized to exenatide (cumulative BMI reduction of 4%).  Compliance was excellent and ranged from 85-100% of the required doses; mean = 95%.  The most common adverse events (all mild-moderate and transient) were nausea (placebo 31%, exenatide 62%), abdominal pain (placebo 23%, exenatide 15%), diarrhea (placebo 31%, exenatide 8%), headache (placebo 46%, exenatide 23%), and vomiting (placebo 8%, exenatide 31%).

Study #3: Predictors of BMI Response with GLP-1RA Treatment in Adolescents with Severe Obesity (unpublished data) We pooled data from our previously-described pi[INVESTIGATOR_881935] 3 months.  Data from the 29 participants who had a 3-month BMI measurement (mean age 14.5 ± 2.0 years; 66% female; mean BMI 40.2 ± 5.7 kg/m2) were included.  The primary predictor variables of interest were appetite and satiety at baseline from a validated questionnaire (Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire: CEBQ) modified to a self-report format for adolescents.  Appetite (or “Food Responsiveness” from the CEBQ) and satiety (or “Satiety Responsiveness” from the CEBQ) were classified as high or low based upon a cut-point of 2.5 on the scale of 1-5 which ranges from “never” to “always” for each item mean.  Additional exploratory predictor variables assessed included: baseline BMI, gender, age, early incidence (1 month) of nausea, GI symptom frequency, and BMI percent change at 1 month.

Predictors of BMI Response with GLP-1 RA Treatment  Mean differences in percent change in BMI from baseline to 3 months between predictor groups were estimated.  The treatment effects and corresponding P-values represent the comparison of exenatide vs. placebo within each sub-group (i.e. the placebo-subtracted treatment effect) (Figure 2).  Interaction P-values are also shown.  Each dot represents the mean percent BMI reduction at 3 months within each sub-group, along with 95% confidence intervals.  As can be appreciated from Figure 2, the clearest separations for percent change in BMI are for gender and baseline appetite.  While other factors will be investigated in our proposed trial, we will focus primarily on gender and appetite as predictors of weight loss response.  Study #4: Short-Term Weight Loss with Meal Replacements in Adolescents with Severe Obesity The use of meal replacements (structured meals consisting of liquid shakes and frozen entrees of known caloric content) represents one promising treatment approach for obesity.  A meta-analysis of studies among obese adults has shown that meal replacements reduce body weight to a greater extent than conventional dieting alone.[ADDRESS_1233246], pre-determined meal regimen removes the “guess-work” from eating.  The use of meal replacements is relatively new in the context of pediatric obesity management but a recent study by [CONTACT_403504].55 demonstrated promising short-term weight loss efficacy (BMI reduction of approximately 6%) in adolescents with severe obesity using meal replacements for a period of [ADDRESS_1233247] observed promising BMI reduction among adolescents with severe obesity (N=17).  Mean BMI reduction was 3.4% in only four weeks (Figure 3); participants in the proposed trial will have up to [ADDRESS_1233248] the majority would achieve ≥5% BMI reduction within 12 weeks.  Therefore, based upon results from Berkowitz et al.55 and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], we believe the proposed approach is feasible and the BMI goal is attainable.  In summary, our extensive portfolio of preliminary work: 1) demonstrates our group’s leadership role in, and commitment to, the field of pediatric obesity medicine; 2) provides initial evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of GLP-1RA treatment in adolescents with severe obesity; 3) highlights the benefits (short-term weight loss) and limitations (long-term weight regain) of meal replacement therapy; and 4) sets the stage for taking the next important step toward developi[INVESTIGATOR_881936]-intensive treatment strategies for teens afflicted with severe obesity.  The logical extension of our previous work is to evaluate the most promising aspect of meal replacement therapy (short-term weight loss) in combination with pharmacotherapy aimed at weight loss maintenance. 1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits – Use in the Pediatric Population We will utilize the once-weekly, extended-release formulation of exenatide, a long-acting GLP-1RA.  The frequency and intensity of GI side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, are lower with long-acting GLP-1RA agents, which should be associated with better tolerability (a prime consideration in pediatric medicine).  The newly-approved injection device for extended-release exenatide is easy-to-use and similar to the short-acting devices.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a lower incidence of nausea, weight reduction with extended-release exenatide is similar to the twice per day formulation.59-[ADDRESS_1233249] efficacious dose for weight loss.62  Exenatide and matching placebo will be donated by [CONTACT_881953].  Placebo/exenatide devices will be indistinguishable.  Study drug and placebo will be managed by [CONTACT_881954].  Education will be provided by a trained study coordinator and/or physician.  Subjects will be instructed to administer the medication under the supervision of a parent/guardian, and will be required to complete a study medication log. 

  Page [ADDRESS_1233250] of GLP-1RA treatment on the maintenance of weight loss and durability of cardiometabolic risk factor improvements among adolescents with severe obesity following a meal replacement induction period.  We hypothesize that adolescents with severe obesity receiving GLP-1RA treatment following a short-term meal replacement induction period will demonstrate superior maintenance of initial BMI reduction 52 weeks following randomization compared to those assigned to placebo (primary endpoint) and that a higher proportion of those assigned to GLP-1RA treatment vs. placebo will maintain ≥5% BMI reduction from baseline to the 52-week time point (secondary endpoint).  Moreover, GLP-1RA treatment will result in superior maintenance of initial reductions of body fat (total, visceral, and subcutaneous), blood pressure, triglycerides/HDL ratio, inflammation, oxidative stress, postprandial glucose-insulin response, insulin resistance, and β cell dysfunction at 52 weeks. 2.2 Secondary Objectives Investigate the mechanisms by [CONTACT_226374]-1RA treatment facilitates weight loss maintenance and identify predictors of response to treatment.  We hypothesize that compared to placebo, GLP-1RA treatment following a period of meal replacement will reduce appetite (and related hormones) and gastric emptying rate, and will increase satiety (and related hormones) and resting energy expenditure at 26- and 52 weeks following randomization.  Moreover, based on our preliminary work, we hypothesize that appetite (and appetite-related hormones) following the meal replacement period and female gender will be associated with superior weight loss maintenance with GLP-1RA treatment. 3 Study Design 3.1 General Design This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial specifically designed to evaluate the effectiveness of GLP-1RA treatment to improve weight loss maintenance following a short-term (up to 8 weeks) meal replacement induction period among up to [ADDRESS_1233251] 5% BMI reduction during the meal replacement induction period in order to be randomized.  Weight checks will be performed regularly (week 4 and 8 with an optional week 6 weight check) during the induction period, and randomization will occur as soon as the 5% BMI reduction benchmark has been achieved (i.e., it may not take the full 8 weeks for some participants to be randomized – it could occur at week 4, 6 or 8).  Participants who do not achieve the 5% BMI reduction benchmark will not continue in the trial.  However, these participants (i.e. those who experienced a reduction in BMI but did not quite achieve the 5% benchmark) will be given the option to undergo reassessment of some of the procedures performed at baseline to evaluate whether BMI reduction less than 5% can improve cardiometabolic risk factors.  This will be considered an ancillary study and individuals who agree to participate, and their parents, will sign a separate assent and consent form, respectively.  After achieving the 5% BMI reduction benchmark, participants will be randomized (1:1) to either exenatide or placebo for a subsequent period of [ADDRESS_1233252] 5% in a maximum timeframe of 8 weeks.  We believe the goal of 5% BMI reduction over a period of [ADDRESS_1233253] individuals based on the study by [CONTACT_403504].55 and on our unpublished data

CONFIDENTIAL This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_881955] a mean BMI reduction of 3.4% with only 4 weeks of meal replacement therapy in 17 participants.   3.2 Primary and Secondary Study Endpoints The primary analysis will compare the mean BMI percent change from randomization to 52 weeks of follow-up between GLP-1RA and placebo groups, adjusted for randomization values of BMI. Confidence intervals (CIs) and P-values will be based on robust variance estimation.  Statistical significance will be considered as p<0.05.  Adjustment for residual imbalances may be made between treatment groups after randomization (e.g., in sex).  We will also evaluate differences in the proportion of subjects able to maintain ≥5% reduction from baseline with CIs and P-values based on the Chi-squared test.  Secondary endpoints of body fat (total body-, visceral-, and subcutaneous fat), triglycerides/HDL ratio, blood pressure, inflammation, oxidative stress, postprandial glucose and insulin response, insulin resistance, and beta cell dysfunction will be characterized over the full length of follow-up for each time point they are measured.  The evaluation will be in a similar fashion as the primary outcome wherein analyses will be adjusted for randomization values.  Longitudinal analyses will also be conducted, incorporating the multiple time points these features are measured.  Mechanism of action metrics of appetite and satiety at [ADDRESS_1233254] modifiers of appetite at randomization (high vs. low, based on CEBQ cutoff and area-under-the-curve for visual analog scale and meal test hormones) and gender will each be evaluated separately for estimates of treatment effect within each subgroup along with a test of interaction.

Total percent body fat, visceral fat (novel feature of the iDXA), and lean muscle mass will be determined by [CONTACT_11323] x-ray absorptiometry (iDXA, GE Healthcare).  The scanning table accommodates body sizes of up to [ADDRESS_1233262] between the acromial process and the bony olecranon.  Sitting blood pressure and heart rate will be measured after the participant has been resting quietly without legs crossed for 10 minutes.  Measurements will be made three consecutive times (3-minute intervals).  The final two of three independent measurements will be averaged.  6.11.3 Blood Analyses Fasting (≥8 hours) blood will be collected for the measurement of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (total-, LDL-, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides), glucose, insulin, and hemoglobin A1c (to be assayed in Fairview Diagnostics Laboratories, Fairview-University Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN - a Center for Disease Control and Prevention certified laboratory).  Fasting samples for C-reactive protein and oxidized LDL cholesterol, along with the biomarkers obtained from the standardized meal tests, will be processed and stored at -80 degrees C for a batched analysis in the University of Minnesota Cytokine Reference Laboratory (CLIA licensed).     6.11.4 Lifestyle/Behavioral Modification Counseling All participants, regardless of group assignment, will receive the same lifestyle/behavioral modification counseling monthly throughout the entire study: delivered at each in-person study visit and on the phone for months when there is no study visit.  The lifestyle/behavioral modification curriculum has been adapted from the NIDDK-sponsored TODAY study lifestyle modification program materials64 and utilized by [CONTACT_67933] a previous54 and ongoing trial.  Trained study coordinators will deliver the lifestyle/behavioral modification counseling, which will focus on small, successive changes in dietary (after meal replacement induction period) and physical activity behaviors through the use of evidence-based behavior change strategies such as self-monitoring, goal setting, reinforcement for goal achievement, stimulus control, social support, problem solving, and motivational techniques.  The educational materials will be given to subjects and parents at the first study visit and selected sections will be reviewed and discussed at each face-to-face and phone-based lifestyle modification counseling session.  We have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of this lifestyle modification protocol in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial among adolescents with severe obesity.54  The intensity of the lifestyle modification is designed to be practical and feasible in the clinic setting.

Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530]  6.11.5 Meal Replacement Induction Period All participants will engage in a meal replacement induction period (that will range from 4 to 8 weeks) with a goal of reducing individual BMI by [CONTACT_2669] 5%.  The meal replacement plan has been used successfully in adolescents with severe obesity.[ADDRESS_1233263]® shakes (one for breakfast and two for lunch or vice-versa), two pre-packaged frozen entrée meals for dinner (Weight Watchers, Smart Ones®), two servings of fruit, and three servings of vegetables per day (Note: shakes contain 190 kcals each (570 total) + meals contain 250 kcals each (500 total) + fruits and vegetables will provide approximately 300 total kcals = 1370 total kcals per day).  Shakes/meals will be provided free of charge – fruits/vegetables will be purchased by [CONTACT_3038].  Guidance will be provided regarding the use of the meal replacement shakes at school, and participants will be encouraged to engage in family meal sessions despi[INVESTIGATOR_403489].  Meal replacement compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_881962] a dietary log throughout the trial.  The percentage of days for which the protocol was strictly followed (no additional calories consumed) will serve as the primary metric of compliance.  Study coordinators will perform weekly reminder phone calls during which the importance of maintaining the dietary log will be emphasized.    6.11.6 Questionnaires Self-report appetite and satiety will be measured using the AEBQ.  Additional relevant eating behavior domains addressed in the AEBQ include emotional overeating and enjoyment of food (hedonic eating).  Additional questionnaires will address disordered eating patterns, anxiety, depression, etc.  These questionnaires, and others that might be added, will allow us to examine the impact of other eating behaviors and external factors in relation to weight loss.  However, results will be considered hypothesis-generating.  An individual who receives a score of [ADDRESS_1233264] will serve many purposes in this study and will be performed at baseline, randomization, 26- and 52 weeks.  After having fasted for ≥8 hours, participants will consume (within five minutes) a fixed-size, single-item breakfast meal of chilled Optifast (474 mL, 320 kcals, 50% carbohydrate, 35% protein, 15% fat; [COMPANY_001]).  Fasting (-10 minutes and 0 minutes) and serial postprandial (15-, 30-, 45-, 60-, and 90-, and 120-minutes: 8 total blood sampling time-points) plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, C-peptide and a panel of hormones either directly or indirectly associated with appetite, satiety, and/or energy intake including leptin, ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY), GLP-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), amylin, pancreatic polypeptide, and cholecystokinin will be measured (will require insertion of a polyethylene catheter in an antecubital vein), along with ratings on 15-cm  visual analog scales from “not at all” to “extremely” for appetite, satiety, desire to eat, and nausea.  This method has been validated for use in appetite research69 and was recently utilized by [CONTACT_881963].70 in a study of adolescents with severe obesity.  We will calculate the area-under-the-curve (AUC) for all the biomarkers and visual analog scale results for the entire standardize meal test.  As recently reported,[ADDRESS_1233265] by [CONTACT_881964] (same time points as hormone measurements) of blood paracetamol (acetaminophen) levels (1,[ADDRESS_1233266], as previously described).[ADDRESS_1233267] been fasting for ≥8 hours.  Metabolic data will be collected using a ventilated hood (Parvo Medics; Sandy UT).  Previous investigations have shown the ventilated hood method to be more accurate and reliable when compared to the other techniques.73, [ADDRESS_1233268] more than five to ten minutes.74  Participants will be instructed to not engage in exercise on the day prior to testing.  Participants will be positioned comfortably in a semi-recumbent fashion for 60 minutes.  Resting gas exchange measurements will be collected using a Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400 Metabolic Cart, (Sandy, UT).  The cart will be calibrated for gas analyses and volume at least twice prior to each test session.  Room air (25°C) will be drawn through the hood at a rate of 40 L/min.  Resting metabolic rates will be collected over the initial 30-minute reclining period with the last 10-minutes averaged into an estimate of resting metabolic rate.   7 Statistical Plan 7.1 Participant Populations for Analysis • Intent-to-treat (ITT): All participants randomized according to the treatment assignment received. • Per-Protocol (PP): All participants randomized without protocol violations and who were compliant (at least 80% of planned doses) with the treatment assignment received.  Protocol violations include: change in status of weight loss/altering medication(s).   • Safety Population: All participants who receive any amount of treatment according to the treatment they receive. 7.2 Sample Size Determination Based on our preliminary data, results of the Berkowitz et al. trial,55 and results of the Wadden et al. trial (in which 90% achieved 5% weight loss during the low calorie diet induction period),[ADDRESS_1233269] 60% will achieve the 5% BMI reduction goal during the meal replacement induction period and would therefore be randomized.  Considering a conservative dropout rate as high as 20% (our previous clinical trial experience with this population has been 10-15%),50, [ADDRESS_1233270] 48 individuals.  Table 4 presents the power associated with a placebo-subtracted BMI reduction ranging from 5-7% based on an overall sample size of 60 (30 in each treatment arm), variability estimates from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4250]50, [ADDRESS_1233271] deviation of approximately 6, and a conservative correlation between baseline and follow-up scores of 0.5.

Treatment compliance will also be evaluated.    7.3.1 Primary Endpoint The primary analysis will be conducted using the ITT population to compare the mean BMI percent change from randomization to 52 weeks of follow-up between GLP-1RA and placebo groups, adjusted for values of BMI at randomization for added precision.  Confidence intervals (CIs) and P-values will be based on robust variance estimation.  Statistical significance will be considered as p<0.05. Supportive analyses using the PP population will also be conducted along with consideration of adjustment for residual imbalances between treatment groups after randomization (e.g., in sex if there is a concerning imbalance between treatment arms). These results will be complemented with analyses summarizing the difference between treatment groups in the proportion of subjects able to maintain ≥5% reduction from baseline.  Analyses will be summarized by [CONTACT_881965] a logit link function and adjusted for BMI at randomization with robust variance estimates for confidence intervals and P-values.   7.3.2 Secondary Endpoints Secondary endpoints of body fat (total body-, visceral-, and subcutaneous fat), triglycerides/HDL ratio, blood pressure, inflammation, oxidative stress, postprandial glucose and insulin response, insulin resistance, and beta cell dysfunction will be characterized over the full length of follow-up for each time point they are measured.  The evaluation will be in a similar fashion as the primary outcome wherein analyses will be adjusted for values at randomization and robust variance estimation will be used for confidence intervals and P-values.  Longitudinal analyses will also be conducted, incorporating the multiple time points at which these features are measured. Supportive analyses using the PP population will also be conducted.

Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530]  7.3.3 Safety Analyses   The safety profile will be evaluated using the Safety analysis population and evaluated using data collected throughout follow-up.  Analyses will be primarily descriptive reporting the number and percentage of adverse events along with categorizations of seriousness, severity, frequency (within a subject), and perceived relatedness to the intervention.  In addition, safety labs of calcitonin, ALT, AST, amylase, lipase, prolactin, TSH, FSH, LH, testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_21907] (DHEAS), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and creatinine, along with change in sexual maturation, bone mineral content from iDXA scans, bone age, QTc interval from ECG, injection site reactions, and gastrointestinal side effects will be evaluated between groups and monitored by [CONTACT_467612] (DSMB) throughout the trial.   7.3.[ADDRESS_1233274] modifiers of appetite at randomization (high vs. low, based on AEBQ cutoff and alternatively area-under-the-curve from the visual analog scale and meal test hormones) and sex.  These will each be evaluated separately for estimates of treatment effect within each subgroup along with a test of interaction analyzed in a similar fashion as the primary endpoint, with adjustment for BMI values at randomization. Complementary analyses using the PP population will also be conducted.   7.[ADDRESS_1233275] precision.  Based upon attrition rates in our previous trials,50, 54 we conservatively anticipate that no more than 20% of the subjects will be lost to follow-up.  Taking this into account, the planned enrollment of 100 is inflated to account for potential drop out.  As such, in the ‘worst case’ situation of randomizing only 60 participants and observing missing data as high as 20%, we will still have >90% power to detect a 5% placebo-subtracted change in BMI from randomization to 52 weeks (primary endpoint).  If the data are missing at random, conditioned on measured covariates, then supplementary analyses adjusting for these covariates will produce unbiased results.  For potential missing data mechanisms beyond measured covariates, we will examine the extent to which results may be affected through sensitivity analyses.    Imputation techniques will be considered for missing data issues, e.g., multiple imputation.  In particular, in the event there is missing data for the primary analysis, we will use a last observation carried forward approach.  Sensitivity analyses will also be conducted, using multiple imputation. Variables to be included in the imputation analysis model include sex, and age along with baseline and interim visit values.  In this fashion, observations obtained during interim visits will be used to facilitate these analyses. Analyses will be based on [ADDRESS_1233276] all potential risks.    8.1.1 Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (iDXA) Scan The iDXA is painless and involves exposure to a very low dose of radiation.  As part of this study, subjects will undergo a total of four iDXA scans.      8.1.[ADDRESS_1233277] study staff if any symptoms of an adverse event are experienced regardless if the participant believes it may or may not be related to study medication.  Adverse events will be reviewed and documented at each study visit and phone call (monitored monthly throughout the study).  Participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_403531].  Overall, the safety profile of exenatide is favorable, with nausea as the most commonly- reported side effect.  The metabolic effects of exenatide are glucose-dependent; therefore, the risk of hypoglycemia is extremely low when used as a mono-therapy, as will be the case in the proposed study.75  Mild injection site reactions (bruising, injection site pain, etc.) have ranged from 2-8% in studies with exenatide extended-release.59-[ADDRESS_1233278] suggested a link.80, 81  It is important to note that in the studies showing an association,80, 81 the absolute increase in risk of pancreatitis was extremely low.  In the proposed study, we will minimize any potential risk of pancreatitis by [CONTACT_532917] T2DM, a disease known to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis.77  Furthermore, we will carefully monitor for reports of abdominal pain at each visit, and will measure lipase levels (pancreatic enzyme).  Of note, the FDA and European Medicines Agency released communications in the summer of 2013 stating that available data do not confirm recent concerns over an increased risk for pancreatic side effects with GLP-1 based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].    8.1.4 Questionnaires There are no risks associated with the questionnaires to be used in the study.  Participants may refuse to answer any questions or stop participating at any time. 8.2 Definitions              8.2.1 Adverse Event An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or

CONFIDENTIAL This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_881966].  Inter-current illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: • results in study withdrawal • is associated with a serious adverse event • is associated with clinical signs or symptoms • leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests • is considered by [CONTACT_403518]: • Unrelated: Clearly not related to study • Unlikely: Unlikely to be related to study • Possible: May be related to study • Probable: Likely to be related to study • Definite: Clearly related to study  8.2.2 Serious Adverse Event Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  • fatal • life-threatening • requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] • results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • a congenital anomaly or birth defect • an important medical event  Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.  They may jeopardize the participant, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse events.   8.2.[ADDRESS_1233279] administration of study treatment at which time a final phone call visit will be completed.    8.2.4 Preexisting Condition  A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.

Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event form.   All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be recorded in the source document, although they should be grouped under one diagnosis.  All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still

If more than five participants are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881938]-related symptoms, the trial will be stopped.  Participants will be instructed that they may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.   8.7 Medical Monitoring Safety monitoring will include individual participant comprehensive assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as they occur.  Adverse events will be monitored closely and participants will be provided with information about the risks/side effects of the study medication and provided with phone numbers to reach the principal investigator/study coordinator in case of emergencies.

The DSMB will meet regularly (frequency to be determined by [CONTACT_39129]) during the trial to review data and evaluate participant safety.  A charter for the DSMB to outline the responsibilities and procedures for the conduct of the monitoring board will be developed and approved by [CONTACT_403520] a plan for frequency of data review prior to the commencement of the trial.  Review materials for the DSMB will be prepared and presented by [CONTACT_15282].

Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  • What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from participants in this study • Who will have access to that information and why • Who will use or disclose that information • The rights of a research participant to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.   In the event that a participant revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For participants that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 9.[ADDRESS_1233287] 6 years after the conclusion of the study.     10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting 10.1 Study Monitoring Plan The study will undergo regular monitoring (annually during the enrollment and follow up period) of the facility, staff, and study documents by [CONTACT_403521], which specializes in regulatory compliance for clinical trials associated with the Food and Drug Administration.  This service provides regular monitoring of all research-related activities and is offered free of charge through the University of Minnesota CTSI.  Monitoring staff will present a summary report to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_403491].

Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_403522], corrective action plans will be devised and implemented by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_403492]. 10.2 Auditing and Inspecting The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], the sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study-related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.). 11   Ethical Considerations This study will be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before commencement of this study.  The investigator should provide a list of IRB members and their affiliate to the sponsor.  All participants and parents/guardians for this study will be provided an assent and consent form, respectively, describing this study and providing sufficient information for participants/families to make an informed decision about participation in this study.  The consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_14884].  The formal assent of a participant and consent of the parent/guardian, using the IRB-approved assent and consent forms, must be obtained before that subject is submitted to any study procedure.  This consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_403523], and the investigator-designated research professional obtaining the consent.   Based upon guidance provided in [ADDRESS_1233288] benefit to the participants (half of the participants will be treated with GLP-1RA, which may provide benefit).  The risk lies mainly in the administration of a medication approved for use in adults with type 2 diabetes in an “off label” population (adolescents ages 12-17) for an “off label” purpose (reduction of BMI and improvement of cardiometabolic risk factors and comorbidities).  An Investigational New Drug (IND) exemption inquiry will be submitted (or a full IND application, if necessary) prior to commencement of the study (note: we received IND exemptions for our previous clinical trials with exenatide in the same patient population).  We will utilize the expertise of staff in the IND Assistance Program, within the University of Minnesota Clinical and Translational Science Institute, to draft the IND exemption request/IND application.    Claudia Fox, M.D., M.P.H., a pediatrician who is board-certified in obesity medicine, will serve as the medical officer for the trial.  The study will undergo regular monitoring by [CONTACT_403525], which specializes in regulatory issues related to studies monitored by [CONTACT_2165].  The following sections detail how each subpart D criterion will be satisfied: a) the risk is justified by [CONTACT_881968]; b) the relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least as favorable to the subjects as that presented by [CONTACT_881969] 33 
CONFIDENTIAL This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_881970]; and c) adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the adolescents and permission of their parents or guardians.   11.1 Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics   One-hundred (100) adolescents (ages 12-17 years old) with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 1.2 times the 95th percentile or BMI ≥35 kg/m2) will be recruited from the University of Minnesota Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Pediatric Weight Management Clinic and member sites of the MN-POC: Mayo Clinic, Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431395], and Park Nicollet.  Adolescents are typi[INVESTIGATOR_881939], comorbid conditions, and adverse cardiometabolic risk factors.  Participants in this study will undergo a series of measurements of BMI, body composition, meal testing, and cardiometabolic risk factors, which will require blood draws.  All costs of testing will be covered by [CONTACT_403529]. 11.2 Source of Research Materials  The following types of research material will be obtained from the participants: blood specimens, anthropometric data, blood pressure data, and other clinical variables.  This material will be used exclusively for research.  Pre-existing chart information will be used.  Data obtained will be stored in a confidential database without direct subject identifiers.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_881940], which will be stored in a separate, secured location.  Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_156837], including source documents with patient identifiers, will be kept in locked file cabinets in a locked office until the completion and publication of the study, at which point any patient identifiers will be removed and data will be stored at a secure storage facility for 6 years.  Access to the locked file cabinet will be given to the study coordinators and principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_13701].  Any study files that will be shared with the University of Minnesota will remove patient identifying information.   11.3 Recruitment and Informed Consent  Subjects will be recruited from the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Pediatric Weight Management Clinic and member sites of the MN-POC.  Appropriate designees will discuss study participation with interested participants and their parents at which time the initial consent and assent discussion will be conducted.  Assent and consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_403530], asking the participant and the parent(s)/guardian(s) to explain the purpose, risk and benefits, and other details of the study, and giving the participant and parent(s)/guardian(s) an opportunity to ask questions.  A copy of the assent and consent form will be given to the participants and parent(s)/guardian(s). 11.[ADDRESS_1233289] all potential risks.    Blood Sampling (fasting and during meal test) There is minimal risk of bruising and infection associated with the blood draw and IV placement.  Medication Expected Adverse Events – Exenatide Extended-Release The long-acting, extended-release formulation of exenatide will be utilized for this trial.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a much lower incidence of nausea and vomiting, the magnitude of weight reduction with exenatide extended-release has been shown to be very similar to the twice per day formulation 
  Page [ADDRESS_1233290] efficacious dose for weight loss – a dose of 0.8 mg elicited no weight loss at 15 weeks in adults with T2DM.  Exenatide extended-release and matching placebo pens will be provided by [CONTACT_881953].  Placebo and active exenatide devices will be indistinguishable.    Study drug and placebo will be housed, dispensed, and tracked in the University of Minnesota Investigational Drug Service Pharmacy.  Subjects will be given identical administration instructions regardless of group assignment.  Instructive education will include reviewing procedures with a trained study coordinator and/or physician.  Subjects will be instructed to administer the medication under the supervision of a parent/guardian.  Subjects will be required to complete a study medication log.  Adverse events will be carefully and comprehensively reviewed and documented at each study visit and during each phone call (adverse events will be monitored monthly throughout the study).  Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_403531].  Overall, the safety profile of exenatide is favorable, with nausea as the most commonly reported side effect.  The metabolic effects of exenatide are triggered by [CONTACT_158125] (i.e., glucose-dependent); therefore, the risk of hypoglycemia is extremely low when used as a mono-therapy, as will be the case in the proposed study.  Mild injection site reactions (bruising, injection site pain, etc.) have ranged from 2-8% in studies with exenatide extended-release.    Evidence is mixed regarding whether acute pancreatitis and other potential pancreatic issues are associated with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists among adult patients with T2DM.  In the proposed study, we will minimize any potential risk of pancreatitis by [CONTACT_532917] T2DM, a disease known to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis.  Furthermore, we will carefully monitor for reports of abdominal pain at each visit, and will measure lipase (pancreatic enzyme).  Regarding potential associations of GLP-[ADDRESS_1233291] with the participant and their parent/guardian, adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event form.   All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be recorded in the source document and will be grouped under one diagnosis.  All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event

Calcitonin, amylase, lipase, prolactin, TSH, FSH, LH, testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_21907] (DHEAS), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) will be measured throughout the study.  Participants who at any time have a level of calcitonin exceeding 50 ng/L will be immediately withdrawn from the study.  Sexual maturation and stature will be tracked throughout the study.  Bone mineral content will be measured by [CONTACT_881972] x-ray.  Of note, we do not expect to observe an interaction between exenatide treatment and bone maturation but believe it is an important variable to measure in a pediatric drug trial.  Duration of the QTc interval will be measured by [CONTACT_90660].  Gastrointestinal side effects (mainly nausea) and other adverse events will be monitored monthly via regular phone calls by [CONTACT_9137].  Quantitative grading of the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal side effects will be conducted with the PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scale at each study visit.  A comprehensive metabolic panel will be performed at baseline and all post-randomization study visits. 11.6 Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others   We believe the potential benefits (the prospect of benefit exists in that half of the participants will receive exenatide, which may reduce BMI and improve risk factors) to the participants outweigh the risks in this study.  Since data from clinical trials in adults and evidence from our own research in adolescents with severe obesity have demonstrated reduction in BMI and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors with exenatide, it is reasonable to expect similar results in the proposed clinical trial.  The side effect profile of exenatide is favorable and the proposed tests are not more than minimal risk.  The alternative treatment approach is standard-of-care lifestyle/behavioral modification therapy and/or treatment with orlistat or “off-label” weight loss medications.  All participants in this study will receive lifestyle/behavioral modification therapy.  Based upon data in adults and our preliminary evidence in adolescents, it is possible that the benefits of exenatide will be additive to the lifestyle/behavioral modification therapy.   11.[ADDRESS_1233292] been evaluated in obese adolescents and novel approaches should be explored.  Data obtained from this study will determine whether exenatide is a safe and effective treatment for weight loss maintenance and sustained improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors among adolescents with severe obesity.   11.8 Data and Regulatory Monitoring Plan Medical Monitoring Safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events.  Adverse events will be monitored closely and subjects will be provided with information about the risks/side effects of the study medication and provided with phone numbers to reach the principal investigator/study coordinator in case of emergencies.

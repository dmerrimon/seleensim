2.1 Background and Rationale
Why This Study is Being Conducted
ABBV -951 (carbidopa phosphate/levodopa phosphate [CDP/LDP]) is a soluble formulation of 
carbidopa/levodopa (CD/LD) prodrugs that is deliverable by [CONTACT_340190] (CSCI).  
ABBV -951 undergoes enzymatic conversion to CD/LD and has the potent ial to achieve efficacy similar to 
levodopa- carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG, denominated carbidopa -levodopa enteral suspension [CLES] in 
the [LOCATION_002] [US]) by [CONTACT_340191].
Patients with Parkinson 's disease (PD) require a therapeutic approach that is tailored to their unique 
needs and responses to levodopa.  ABBV -951 enables continuous, subcutaneous, and individualized 
delivery of CD/LD, covering the wide range of levodopa doses required to adequately control motor 
symptoms in patients with advanced PD ( aPD).  Therefore, this novel treatment may provide an 
alternative therapy to many patients whose motor complications are inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_340192].
While the systemic toxicology and tolerability profiles of CD/LD are well established preclinically and in 
humans, the local (skin) and systemic tolerability following subcutaneous delivery of ABBV -[ADDRESS_420960] been measured in ani mal models, as well as in the clinical setting.  In 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant preclinical studies in rats and monkeys, doses of ABBV -951, 
considered therapeutically relevant in PD patients, were demonstrated to be well tolerated at the 
infus ion site and did not significantly increase serum phosphate levels.  Local irritation was assessed in 
dogs at a 50/200 mg/mL concentration, following CSCI for 28 days with a fixed indwelling catheter at a 
rate of 0.1 or 0.25 mL/hour (120/480 mg/day and 300 /1200 mg/day, respectively).  120/480 mg/day 
was well tolerated, and the infusion site findings were similar to those of the vehicle control without 
signs of irritation or inflammation stemming from ABBV -951.  Findings at the infusion site of animals 
treat ed with the higher infusion rate (0.25 mL/hour) were confounded by a concurrent bacterial 
infection, and it was not possible to clearly determine whether ABBV -951 was well tolerated; however, 
the infusion of ABBV -951 at the same concentration (50/200 mg/mL ), but at a higher infusion rate 
(0.5 mL/hour) for fewer days (5 days) was well tolerated, with only minimal signs of irritation at the 
infusion site.  In cohorts from the Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (Study M15 -733), in which 
ABBV -[ADDRESS_420961] been reported from 
ongoing Phase 1 studies in PD patients, where ABBV -951 is administered at therapeutic doses for 24 or 
72 hours (Study M15 -738) or for up to 28 days (Study M15 -739).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The dose ranges of ABBV- 951 to be utilized in this study are similar to those administered in the Phase 1 
studies in PD subjects (Studies M15 -738 and M15 -739); however, t he duration of the continuous 
infusion administration will be long -term.  Therefore, subject safety and tolerability over long -term 
exposure will need to be assessed.
This open -label, single -arm, Phase 3 study will be conducted in an outpatient setting to evaluate local 
and systemic safety and tolerability, and explore the efficacy of therapeutic doses of ABBV -951 infused 
continuously for 52 weeks in subjects with PD.
Clinical Hypothesis
CSCI of ABBV -951 is safe and well- tolerated for up to 52 weeks in PD patients with motor fluctuations no 
longer controlled by [CONTACT_340193].
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
The combination of oral levodopa and DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (DDCI), such as carbidopa or 
benserazide, has been used for many years in patients with PD to control motor symptoms, and the 
systemic safety profile is well established.  Furthermore, achieving stable plasma levodopa 
concentrations through continuous infusion has bee n demonstrated previously with LCIG and resulted in 
greater efficacy than oral CD/LD as assessed by a reduction in overall daily "Off"time accompanied by 
[CONTACT_67191] "On"time without troublesome dyskinesia.  Therefore, it is anticipated that ABBV -951 can 
provide a similar benefit if plasma levodopa concentrations can be maintained stable and within the 
therapeutic window.
Potential risks of receiving an ABBV -951 dose lower than required for PD symptom control include 
experiencing an exacerbation of PD sympt oms ( "Off" state) characterized by [CONTACT_340194], tremor, and stiffness.  Potential risks of receiving an ABBV -951 dose higher than what is 
required for motor symptom control include experiencing dyskinesias (abnormal or uncontrolled 
movements) and hallucinations.  Other anticipated risks are well characterized levodopa -related side 
effects, including nausea, vomiting, and dizziness; however, not all of the potential side effects of the 
drug are known.  Subjects may also experience gene ral discomfort or inconvenience related to study 
procedures.
Since ABBV -951 is administered as a CSCI, there is a potential for safety issues related to infusion site 
tolerability.  These issues may include infusion site irritation and inflammation (swelli ng, redness, pain, 
itching), bruising, skin infection, and discomfort related to the feeling of liquid flowing through the 
needle/cannula.  Data from preclinical studies and from a study in healthy volunteers show that infusion 
is generally well tolerated; however, the ABBV -951 infusion rates (i.e., flow rates) that will be used in the 
current study are anticipated to be higher than those used in the healthy volunteer study and therefore 
local tolerability at the infusion site will be a specific focus in th is study.
For details, please see the safety data in the ABBV- 951 investigator's brochure .1
Based on the limited information available to date, exposure to ABBV -951 does not appear to pose 
additional risks to study participants because of the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19).  ABBV- [ADDRESS_420962] ics of these compounds, which are commonly 
used as symptomatic treatment of PD globally.

PD symptoms (including tremor, bradykinesia, dyskinesia, daytime somnolence, and indication of 
propensity for impulsive behaviors) as asse ssed by [CONTACT_328162] 's KinetiGraph™/Personal KinetiGraph™ 
(PKG) wearable device (as allowed by [CONTACT_427]) from Baseline to the Week 26 Visit.
3.5 Exploratory Research:  Biomarker Research Endpoints
Optional samples will be collected during the study to evaluate known and/or novel biomarkers related 
to PD, related conditions, ABBV- 951, or drugs of a similar class.  Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples 
may be analyzed for genetic markers that may help t o understand PD and the subject 's response to 
ABBV -951.  Genes of interest may include (but are not limited to) those associated with 
pharmacokinetics (drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins), genes within the target 
pathway (dopaminergic pathw ays), or other genes believed to be related to PD (alpha -synuclein 
[SNCA]).  Research may also include epi[INVESTIGATOR_340171] 's 
response to treatment or disease.  Research on samples collected will follow country -spec ific 
regulations.  This research is exploratory in nature, and the results may not be included within the 
clinical study report.

a. The Screening Period may be extended up to a total of [ADDRESS_420966] 2 days to account for the collection of PD Diaries and pump tr aining.
Note:  As allowed by [CONTACT_427], subjects will receive the PKG-watch following Screening Visit 1 (V1) and will be required 
to wear it (refer to the currently approved manufacturer 's directions) during the Monitoring Period and at least until the 
completion of Week 26 (V11); thereafter, wearing of the PKG-watch will be optional.  The Monitoring Period consists of at least 
6 consecutive days during the Screening Period (prior to V3) where subjects will be required to collect PD diaries and wear the 
PKG watch at the same time.  "As allowed by [CONTACT_427] " is applicable to all wearable device references throughout this 
protocol and its appendices.  The [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) should be consulted if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_340172], there are circumstances that might interfere with the use of the PKG device (e.g., religious reasons, atopi c 
dermatitis).  A subject's inability to wear the PKG watch, due to logistics hindering the watch from being made available, will 
not preclude him/her from study participation.
Study Periods
Screening Period
The intended 10 -to 42 -day Screening Period (may be extended up to a total of 90 days for extenuating 
circumstances) will consist of 2 screening visits (V1 and V2) and a [ADDRESS_420967] 30 days prior to commencing ABBV -951.  Historical data (medical 
records, etc.) are acceptable documentation for the use of stable medication.

initial study drug administration, whichever is longer, with the exception of medications containing 
levodopa and catechol -O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, which must be discontinued for at least 
[ADDRESS_420969] be consented for the study prior to discontinuing any prohibited medications f or the 
purpose of meeting study eligibility.  See Section 5.3.  The investigator or his/her designee must confirm 
continued subject eligibility at V3, prior to enrollment.  Considering historical data and the minimum 
time required for the Monitoring Period, the Screening Period may be completed in as short as 10 days; 
it should be targeted to be completed in approximately 40 days and should not excee d a total of 90 days 
overall.
Subjects will be required to wear the wearable device for 6 consecutive days prior to Visit 3 (i.e., the 
6-Day Monitoring Period), in countries where such devices are approved.  The PD Diaries should be 
completed for at least 2 consecutive days of the 6 -day Monitoring Period, prior to Visit 3 (Day 1).
Treatment Period
The Treatment Period starts with the initiation of ABBV- 951 and consists of 2 parts:  a 4 -week 
Optimization Period and a 48 -week Maintenance Period.
Optimization Period :  during the [ADDRESS_420970] 's ABBV- [ADDRESS_420971] 's concomitant PD 
medications (e.g., dopamine -agonists, selective monoamine oxidase B [MAO -B] inhibitors, amantadine, 
safinamide), including tapering down or even suspending such medications, in accordance with the 
prescribing information, to a chieve the therapeutic approach that, in the investigator 's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], controls 
the subject 's symptoms in the most satisfactory way.
Maintenance Period :  the Maintenance Period will consist of 48 weeks of a 24 -hour daily CSCI of 
ABBV -951 at the optimal therapeutic dose.  During this 48 -week period, subjects should maintain a 
stable regimen of all concomitant medications unless changes are considered medically necessary, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  ABBV -951 can be adjusted throughout the study.  In th e event of dose 
adjustments for ABBV -951 or other concomitant medications (including adding or suspending other PD 
medications) these adjustments should be documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
On the morning of Day 1 (V3) subjects will nee d to be in a clinically defined "Off" state (i.e., no PD 
medications for at least 12 hours before initiation of study drug).  After confirmation of eligibility and a 
brief clinical examination, subjects will receive an oral loading dose of LD+DDCI followed by [CONTACT_340199] -[ADDRESS_420972], the starting dose level for the continuous infusion rate of ABBV -951 will be calculated 
according to their baseline dose of oral levodopa (or le vodopa equivalent dose [LED]), based on the 
proposed conversion rates from Tomlinson et al,2guidance from Espay et al,3and a conversion 
algorithm based on data from Phase 1 studies (see Section 4.2).
Subjects might also resume PD medications that do not contain levodopa or COMT inhibitors (such as 
dopamine agonists, MAO -B inhibitors, amantadine, safinamide, etc.) as these concomitant medications

and according to the prescribing information, subjects may start to taper off concomitant PD 
medications during the [ADDRESS_420973] 's PD symptoms by 
[CONTACT_340200] 's therapeutic regimen by [CONTACT_340201]/or suspending previous concomitant PD medications, and at the same time increasing, 
decreasing, or maintaining the ABBV- [ADDRESS_420974] 's clinical response.  If all 
concomitant PD medications have been tapered off, the dose of ABBV -[ADDRESS_420975] is obtained, as determined by [CONTACT_093].  
Optimal clinical response is defined by [CONTACT_340202] "On"time and minimizing the number 
of "Off" epi[INVESTIGATOR_340173].  This optimization also minimizes "On"time with troublesome 
dyskinesia.
During the Optimization Period, study visits will occur as follows:
Day 1 (V3)
Day 2 (V4)
Week 1 (V5)
Week 2 (V6)
Week 3 (V7)
Week 4 (V8)
The investigator may perform unscheduled visits to make any needed adjustments within the 4 -week 
Optimization Period.
After Week 4 (V8), all subjects will begin the Maintenance Period and should maintai n a stable 
treatment regimen of ABBV -951 and other concomitant medications, including any PD medications that 
are still being administered after the Optimization Period.  Dose adjustments of medications, including 
ABBV -951, can be made if considered medically necessary, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  Any 
changes to medications or the dose of ABBV -951 should be recorded in the eCRF.
During the Maintenance Period, study visits will occur as follows: 
Week 6 (V9)
Week 13 (V10)
Week 26 (V11)
Week 39 (V12)
Week 52 (V13) or in case of premature discontinuation.
All visits, apart from the Screening visits (V1 and V2) and V3 (Day 1), will be allowed a window of 
± 3days.
As part of the study procedures, study drug is intended to be dispensed to subjects every 2 weeks during 
the Treatment Period with or without a clinic visit being completed.
Unscheduled clinic visits may occur per investigator discretion as deemed necessary.  The appropriate 
protocol assessments to be conducted at an unscheduled clinic visit ar e to be determined by [CONTACT_48677] 13 of 107 
STUDY M15 -741  |  Version 7.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_420976] (or authorized representatives, if allowed per local regulations) may 
return to the clinic site for additional study drug or drug delivery system components or accessories.
In rare situations where a visit cannot be completed onsite due to an extenuating event (e.g., COVID -19-
related conditions), some assessments may be performed remotely.  Refer to the Operations Manual 
(Appendix F) for further guidance.
Treatment Arm
Subjects will receive an oral loading dose on Day 1 (V3) followed by a [ADDRESS_420977] 's oral 
regimen prior to commencing ABBV -951 (see Section 4.2).  The starting continuous infusion rate (F1) will 
be calculated taking into consideration the LED and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ABBV- 951 
(see Section 4.2).  The investigator may adjust the prescribed infusion rate during visits to reach 
optimization of motor symptoms control.  Subjects may choose their daily continuous infu sion rate from 
3preprogrammed infusion rates.  The investigator will determine and program the base daily infusion 
rate (F1) within the allowable range (0.17 to 1.04 mL/hr) and may program 2 additional infusion rates 
(F2 and F3) within a ± 20% limit from the prescribed base infusion rate.  F2 should be an alternative 
higher continuous dose, and F3 should be an alternative lower continuous dose.  F3 may be reduced 
beyond the 20% limit from the prescribed base infusion rate (F1) if medically necessary and only with 
approval from the [COMPANY_013] therapeutic area medical director (TA MD).  If programmed, the alternative 
infusion rates (F2 and F3) must be within the allowable range (0.17 to 1.04 mL/hr).  If the alternative 
infusion rates (F2 and F3) are not required, they must be programmed to "OFF ."  Subjects will receive a 
System User Manual that contains instructions for the daily management of their infusion.
Dermatologic Assessment
Subcutaneous delivery of study drug calls for attention during the procedures rela ted to administration 
(general hygiene, skin disinfection, maintenance of a dirt -free environment while manipulating the 
system components, etc.), and subject training and adherence to proper techniques are critical.  
Manipulation at the level of the cannula pad due to disconnection and reconnection of the tubing might 
also lead to skin irritation, abrasion, and other lesions, which could evolve to infection and cellulitis 
because of bacterial contamination.  Infusion site reactions including erythema, pain , or any other 
inflammation signs have been observed.[ADDRESS_420978] are mild or moderate in severity and resolve with 
treatment with antibiotics and interventions su ch as incision and drainage.  Some cases might require 
further management and clinical correlation is recommended.  Investigators should obtain dermatologic 
consult if needed.
Absorption of study drug by [CONTACT_340203]/day, skin characteristics, hydration, etc.  Accumulation of study drug under the skin, 
manifesting as an elevated area of the skin, with or without induration and/or seepage of study drug 
from the infusion site after removal o f the cannula or during infusion, might be a sign of reduced 
absorption, which could lead to irritation of the area and increased risk of bacterial contamination.  In 
these cases, more frequent rotation of the infusion site (using a new cannula/infusion se t) is 
recommended to minimize the risk of infection.
If any moderate to severe infusion site -related AE, such as cellulitis/abscess formation, ecchymoses, 
subcutaneous nodules, or scarring occurs, or if any infusion site -related reaction is assessed with a n

Operations Manual [ Appendix F]), the investigat or or designee is instructed to do the following:
1.Photograph the skin reaction and follow the appropriate procedure for submission of 
photographs.  In rare situations where an assessment or visit cannot be completed onsite due to 
an extenuating event (e.g. , COVID -19-related conditions), the subject may be asked to obtain 
and submit a self -captured photograph of the skin reaction.
2.Refer the subject to a dermatologist for comprehensive evaluation (including skin biopsy if 
applicable), treatment, and follow -up per standard practice.  The subject should be referred to a 
dermatologist within [ADDRESS_420979]'s standard practice.
Post -Treatment Activities
Subjects who prematurely discontinue or are not enrolled in the extension study (M15 -737) will receive 
a [ADDRESS_420980] of subjects with PD who report motor compli cations that are 
inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_340204] a minimum of 2.5 hours of "Off" time 
per day as assessed by [CONTACT_340205]/Day 1 (V3).  Subjects must be on a 
stable oral PD medication regimen for at least 30 days prior to commencing ABBV -951.
Rationale for Selection of Therapeutic Dose Range
CD/LD remains the standard of care for PD.  It is, however, recognized that the treatment of PD is highly 
individualized; both the treatments administered and their doses must be customized, based on the 
patients 'signs and symptoms and their response to medication.  In practice, this provides a wide 
distribution of patient doses, even within clinical trials.
In the LCIG double -blind, double dummy pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076] (S tudies S187.3.001/S187.3.002), the median dose 
of levodopa was 1013 mg/day and the mean dose was 1117 mg/day for 16 -hour daily infusion.  These 
data represent a small subset of subjects where dosing was constrained to maintain the blinding of the 
study.  T herefore, > 90% of subjects used less than 2000 mg over a 16 -hour treatment period.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].In the LCIG open -label safety study (Study S187.3.004), in which > 300 subjects were enrolled, the dosing 
was more reflective of clinical practice, where a significant prop ortion of subjects were able to simplify 
their therapy by [CONTACT_340206].  The LD doses from this study ranged from less than 500 mg/day to more than 
3500 mg/day over a 16 -hour tr eatment period ( Table 1).
ABBV -951 is intended to be a 24 -hour/day therapy (i.e., subjects will be exposed 8 more hours –or 50% 
longer –compared to L CIG exposure).  The results of a pharmacokinetic study (Study M18 -764) 
comparing LD plasma concentrations between LCIG plus LD/CD tablets and ABBV -951 in healthy 
volunteers demonstrated that LD from ABBV- 951 is 8% more bioavailable than enterally -absorbed LD.  
Based on molecular weight (MW), 100 mg of LD are equivalent to 141 mg of levodopa phosphate (LDP).
Using these data, it is estimated that LD doses could range from less than 700 mg/day to about 
4260 mg/day, over a 24 -hour treatment period (approximate ly 1000 -6000 mg LDP).

Doses
Oral Loading Dose
The purpose of the oral loading dose is to allow subjects to achieve symptom control quickly upon 
initiation of treatment.  The loading dose for this study will be an oral dose of LD+DDCI corresponding as 
closely as possible t o the subject 's habitual first morning dose of LD+DDCI.  Immediate -release 
formulations of LD+DDCI medications should be utilized for the oral loading doses.
Loading doses will be administered only once, at the initiation of ABBV -951 treatment, unless dosing is 
discontinued for ≥ 3 hours .  Temporary disconnection (< 1 hour) for daily hygiene or to change empty 
syringes does not count as discontinuation and does not require a loading dose upon resuming the 
infusion (see Section 5.8).
Continuous Infusion Rate
Following the oral loading dose, ABBV -951 will be delivered continuously (24 hours daily) via an infusion 
set connected to a pump.  Each subject 'sinitial base continuous infusion rate (F1) will be calculated 
based on the subject 's oral LD therapy over the [ADDRESS_420981] 's baseline dose of immediate release (IR) LD+DDCI is the starting point f or establishing the 
levodopa equivalent dose (LED) for dose selection (note: the levodopa contained in Stalevo® 
[CD/LD/entacapone] counts as IR).  If a subject is not taking an IR formulation of LD+DDCI, the LED is 
calculated from the primary levodopa -cont aining medication.  The conversion factors to use in 
calculating the total LED for dose selection are provided in Table 2and are based on data from th e 
literature.2,[ADDRESS_420982] 's baseline CD/LD IR dose should be 
added together to provide the total starting LED for ABBV -951 conversion.

Once a subject 's daily LED has been determined, the starting infusion rate for ABBV -951 should be 
selected from Table 3.  The continuous infusion rates below are estimated for the mid -point of the LED 
intervals provided and are designed to deliver therapeutic levodopa exposure.  The ABBV- 951 infusion 
will be delivered continuously via an infusion se t connected to an ambulatory pump.

Titration
The ABBV -951 base infusion rate (F1) may be adjusted at the investigator 's discretion at any time 
throughout the study to achieve and maintain an optimal therapeutic response for the individual 
subject, which means maximizing the functional "On"time during the day by [CONTACT_340208] "Off" epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (bradyk inesia) and minimizing "On"time with troublesome dyskinesia.  
Due to the capabilities of the infusion pump utilized in Study M15 -741, the infusion rate must be 
increased or decreased by [CONTACT_340209] 0.01 mL/hr, corresponding to approximately 1.7 mg LD/hr, or 
approximately 40 mg LD over the 24 -hour period.  Therefore, an increase in the base infusion rate of 
0.02 mL/hr will result in total increase of approximately 80 mg of LD over the 24 -hour period.  An 
increase of 0.04 mL/hr will result in a total increa se of approximately 160 mg of LD over the 24 -hour

24-hour period, etc.
Should the calculated daily LED from oral medications at Baseline (based on the 16-hour treatment 
period) for a subject be ≥2000 mg, the starting base infusion rate (F1) should be set at 0.70 mL/hr.
The investigator may decide to increase the infusion rate only after assessing the subject for clinical 
efficacy (achieving optimal therapeutic response, as defined above) and safety.  The safety profile of 
ABBV -951 at doses higher than 200/4000 carbidopa phosphate/levodopa phosphate (CDP/LDP) resulting 
from infusion rates > 0.70 mL/hr will be assessed throughout the study via neurological examinations 
and physical assessment, as described in Appendix D .  All AE s will be assessed, with particular attention 
to AESIs of polyneuropathy, weight loss, somnolence, and hallucinations/psychosis.
Alternative Continuous Infusion Rates (F2, F3)
Like other therap eutic approaches for PD, which require an individualized optimization, this study 
provides subjects the ability to select from alternative infusion rates within a specified range, if allowed 
by [CONTACT_093].
Two additional infusion rates (F2 and F3) ma y be preprogrammed into the pump by [CONTACT_093].  
F2should be an alternative higher continuous dose, and F3 should be an alternative lower continuous 
dose.  The additional infusion rates must be selected within a ± 20% limit from the prescribed base 
continuous infusion rate ( F1).  F3 may be reduced beyond the 20% limit from the prescribed base 
infusion rate (F1) if medically necessary and only with approval from the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
Infusion rates lower than 0.17 mL/hr or higher than 1.04 mL/hr are not a llowed .
If, during the study, the base daily infusion rate (F1) is programmed at 0.17 mL/hr, the alternative lower 
infusion rate (F3) must be disabled.  If, at any point during the study the base daily infusion rate (F1) is 
programmed at 1.04 mL/hr, the alternative higher infusion rate (F2) and the extra dose option (see 
below) must be disabled.
The starting infusion rate must not be higher than 0.70 mL/hr; adjustments may be done only after 
clinical assessment (neurological and physical examination).
If the alternative infusion rates (F2 and F3) are not required, the investigator or his/her de signee must 
disable them by [CONTACT_340210] "OFF"and the subject will not be able to choose alternative 
infusion rates.  If the investigator enables these options , the subject may select the infusion rate from 
these 3 preprogrammed choices (F1, F2, or F3) and will be required to record on the dosing diary the 
time of the day when they change the infusion rate.  The numerical values of the infusion rates cannot 
be m odified by [CONTACT_748].
Extra Doses
If the investigator allows it, subjects may self -administer extra doses of ABBV- 951 during the course of 
the 24 hours to address immediate medical needs, such as the rapid deterioration of motor function.   
The ability t o self -administer extra doses, the extra dose volume and lockout time (the interval between 
extra doses) are determined and programmed by [CONTACT_15009]/her designee and cannot be 
modified by [CONTACT_748].  The investigator can choose the volume o f the extra doses from the following

levodopa, respectively).  The lockout time is programmable from 1 hour to 24 hours in 15 -minute 
increments; the mini mum lockout duration is 60 minutes.  If the investigator elects not to allow the use 
of extra doses, this function can be disabled by [CONTACT_340211] "0.00 ."
If the extra dose function is enabled, subjects are required to record on the dosing diary t he time of the 
day when they self -administered an extra dose.  Dosing diaries will be reviewed by [CONTACT_340212].
If the need for extra doses is greater than 5 times per day, the investigator should consider increasing 
the base in fusion rate and increasing the lockout time to limit the number of extra doses per day.  If at 
any time in the study F1 or F2 are set at 1.04 mL/hr, the extra dose option should be disabled.  Doses 
of LDP higher than 6000 mg/24 hr (equivalent to 4260 mg LD /24 hr) are not allowed under any 
circumstances during the study.
The investigator should consider this upper limit when programming alternative infusion rates and/or 
volumes and lockout time of extra doses.  Guidance is provided in Table 4.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The investigator should consider whether to enable alternative infusion rates and extra doses and 
provide those options to subjects, based on his/her clinical judgment of the subject 's cognitive 
performance, compliance, and personality traits.
Allowing an alternative highe r infusion rate (F2) could facilitate refining the base continuous infusion 
rate during the optimization period.  Subjects who report troublesome dyskinesia, freezing of gate, or 
nocturnal akinesia at baseline are often treated with sub -optimal oral daily doses of LD .5,6  In these 
cases, programming F1 as suggested in Table 3could result in a sub -optimal dose of ABBV- 951.  The 
investigator may program F2, starting with small increments (e.g., 5% –10%), and enable subjects who 
feel underdosed to switch to the alternative higher infusion rate.  Similarly, if subjec ts are expected to 
sustain extended physical activity (e.g., sport) or require higher doses of levodopa at a specific time of 
day, F2 could be temporarily selected to account for the higher dopaminergic demand.  Also, if subjects 
require more than [ADDRESS_420983] not suitable to choose 
among the p rovided options, he/she should disable the alternative higher infusion rate by [CONTACT_340213] "OFF."
Investigators may consider whether to allow subjects to switch to an alternative lower infusion rate (F3) 
before going to bed, if subjects report no com plaints of nocturnal akinesia or nighttime symptoms at 
baseline or if subjects have known history of impulse control disorders or nocturnal hallucinations .6-[ADDRESS_420984] that the low variability and fluctuations in plasma LD exposure from 
continuous delivery may translate in an average reduction of efficacious daily levodopa doses ;9hence, if 
between visits during the optimization period, subjects experience sustained dyskinesia, they may be 
instructed to select the alternative lower infusion rate and record it in their dosing diary, until the 
investigator adjusts the base parameters at the following study visit.  The alternative lower infusion rate, 
F3, may be programmed to be up to 20% lower than F1.  F3 may be reduced beyond the 20% limit from 
the prescribed base infusion rate (F1) if medically necessary and only with approval from the [COMPANY_013] TA 
MD.
If nocturnal akinesia is present or if bothersome nighttime symptoms exist, investigators should consider 
maintaining the base infusion rate (F1) consistent for the 24 hours and disable the option for the 
alternative lower infusion rate (programming it to "OFF").  Similarly, if the investigator prefers not to 
provide this option or considers the subject not suitable to choose among the provided options, he/she 
should disable the alternative lower infusion rate by [CONTACT_340214] "OFF."

STUDY M15 -741  |  Version 7.0  |  EudraCT 2018 -002144 -85
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The oral loading dose will be determined by [CONTACT_340220].  The infusion rate of ABBV -951 (and therefore the total am ount of ABBV -951 administered) will 
be calculated based on the subject 's levodopa equivalent dose (LED) and an ABBV -[ADDRESS_421008] 's motor symptoms as assessed by [CONTACT_340221]/or other 
evaluations of symptom severity.  The ABBV -951 basal infusion rate can also be adjusted throughout the 
study at the discretion of the investigator.  The investigator may preprogram 3 infusion rates into the 
pump, 1 that corresponds to the base prescribed daily infusion rate (F1) and 2 additional infusion rates 
(F2 and F3) that are progra mmable within a ± 20% limit from the prescribed base infusion rate and 
always within the allowable range (0.17 to 1.04 mL/hr); F2 should be an alternative higher continuous 
dose and F3 should be an alternative lower continuous dose.  F3 may be reduced beyo nd the 20% limit 
from the prescribed base infusion rate (F1) if medically necessary and only with approval from the 
[COMPANY_013] TA MD.  If the alternative infusion rates (F2 and F3) are not required, the investigator or his/her 
designee must program them to "OF F."  Thus, subjects might have the freedom to choose among the 
preprogrammed infusion rates or to self- administer extra doses of ABBV- 951 during the day, per the 
investigator' s judgment.  The pump will be programmed by [CONTACT_340222].
During the Treatment Period, the ABBV -[ADDRESS_421009] using study 
devices (i.e., infusion set connected to an infusion pump) indicated for subcutaneous delivery.  The drug 
delivery system will nee d to be loaded with the investigational drug at the same time every day for 
subjects who require 1 vial per day (every 24 hours), or at the same times of the day (every 12 hours) for 
subjects who require 2 vials per day.  To prepare the drug delivery syste m, reference the System User 
Manual instructions: study drug will be loaded into a syringe that will then be connected to the pump.  
The infusion site will be prepared.  The insertion device will be used to insert the cannula and apply the 
cannula pad to t he skin.  The infusion set tubing will be attached to the syringe, primed, and then 
attached to the cannula pad on the subject.  The daily dose will be initiated by [CONTACT_340223]-programmed pump.  When vial changes are performed, depending on how long t he infusion set has 
already been in use, subjects may need to either:  a) obtain all new components or b) obtain all new 
components except for a new infusion set (i.e., infusion set tubing and insertion device/cannula pad, 
which can be used up for 3 consec utive days).  For the latter situation, the subject will use a new syringe 
and a new vial adapter to draw their therapy from a new vial, connect the new syringe to the pump, 
connect their existing infusion set to the syringe, and start their therapy.
The i nfusion set and the infusion site (area of the skin where the subcutaneous cannula is inserted) can 
be left unchanged for up to 3 days when the drug is infused continuously.  This includes maintaining the 
same infusion set when changing empty syringes or u sing a new vial (for those who require two vials per 
day).  However, a new vial adapter and a new syringe are required any time a new vial is used.  The 
infusion set should be changed, and the infusion site rotated every 3 days unless a more frequent 
rotat ion schedule is medically indicated (investigators should consider instructing the subject to rotate 
the infusion site more frequently than every 3 days (e.g., every 2 days or every day) if skin irritation 
and/or drug pooling is observed).  Temporary inter ruptions of study drug are allowed (e.g., for hygiene, 
or changing empty syringes).  A change in vial, vial adapter, syringe and infusion set, and rotation of the 
infusion site are required before resuming infusion for interruptions longer than approximate ly 1 hour.  
If study drug is interrupted for approximately 3 hours or more, a loading dose is recommended to 
quickly achieve symptomatic control (see table below):

morning dose taken prior to commencing ABBV -951.
The investigator will select the length of the infusion set cannula among those provided, considering 
individual subject characteristics such as thickness of the abdominal subcutaneous fat tissue. The 
appropriate cannula will be long enough to deliver study drug solution to the subcutaneous tissue 
without infiltrating the muscle wall, which can cause pain and/or occlusion of the cannula.
The infusion should be administered to a site with ample subcutaneous tissue and atleast 5 centimeters 
(or 2 inches) away from the site of application of ECG electrodes, and at least 5 centimeters (or 2 inches) 
away from the umbilicus (if the selected area for infusion is the abdomen).  Infusions should not be 
administered to areas of s carred or hardened tissue or stretch marks, to skin folds or creases where the 
body naturally bends a great deal, or to areas where clothing might cause irritation (e.g., near the 
beltline).
In the event of an infusion pump malfunction or other event that temporarily prevents delivery of study 
drug, the time period during which study drug was not delivered will be recorded by [CONTACT_779], in the 
electronic data capture system.  The subject should call the clinical study personnel, so that they may 
attempt to r esume the study drug infusion.  The time that the infusion stopped and/or malfunction will 
be recorded to the minute if known (otherwise, an estimated time will be recorded).  If the infusion is 
resumed, the restart time will be recorded to the minute.  If the study drug infusion is not able to be 
resumed or if the investigator is concerned that the subject may not be able to successfully complete 
the study drug infusion requirements, the subject may be discontinued from the study.
Alternative Infusion Site Locations
Although the abdomen is the preferred infusion site location, situations may occur where an alternative 
infusion site may need to be considered for a subject.  If the investigator believes that an alternative 
infusion site is needed for a partic ular subject, for example, due to abdominal skin reactions that do not 
heal fast enough to allow for rotation, surgical interventions, scar tissue, or anatomical restrictions, the 
following alternative sites may be considered after obtaining approval from [COMPANY_013] TA MD:
Thighs:  anterior (both lateral and medial)
Arms:  posterior (both lateral and medial)
Flanks
Investigators should factor in the following when considering one of these sites:
Body composition and distribution of subcutaneous tissue:  look f or places on the skin where 
you can "pi[INVESTIGATOR_340179]" to ensure there is adequate subcutaneous tissue (e.g., for males, more 
around the abdomen; for females, more around hips and upper thighs).

the flank or to the dominant arm by [CONTACT_1029].
Hirsutism:  to minimize issues with adhesiveness of cannula pad, avoid areas with excess hair or 
consider removing hair without causing blade -related skin trauma.  If sha ving with razor, 
consider doing 1 day or 2 days prior to cannula insertion.  Alternatives to razor shaving are 
trimming or use of hair removal creams.
Sweating:  to minimize issues with adhesiveness of cannula pad and risk of folliculitis (especially 
if blade-shaven), avoid areas where the subject sweats significantly and avoid tight -fitting 
clothes on the chosen area.  Also consider using commercially available ancillary adhesive 
materials.
Sleep position:  discuss expectation with subject to either adjust sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_340180].
Physical activity and exercise:  consider choosing sites with the least risk of being impacted by 
[CONTACT_340224] s to prevent activity -related 
dislodgement of the cannula and subsequent inadequate infusion delivery (intradermal rather 
than subcutaneous).  Avoid sunscreen or lotion on the area and if used, ensure the area is 
cleaned with alcohol pad/wipes and allowed to dry completely before inserting the cannula.
Subject preference:  subject's desire for cannula concealment (thigh and flank) versus no 
concealment (arm).
The alternative infusion site(s) may be used sporadically or integrated into the routine with the 
abdomen rotation at the investigator's discretion.  If an alternative site is used exclusively long term, it is 
preferable to alternate (right/left) and maintain the 2.5 -cm (1 -inch) distance from the previous infusion 
site when returning to the same side. Sites will record information in subject 's source documentation 
on the alternative infusion site(s) used.
Packaging and Labeling
ABBV -951 will be supplied as solution for infusion in vials in an open -labeled fashion and packaged in a 
carton containing 6 v ials per carton.  ABBV- 951 will be labeled as ABBV- 951 12/240 mg/mL

An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relations hip with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is co nsidered causally related to the use of the 
product.
Investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of A Es on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AE s will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/pr ocedure scheduled to occur during the study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and the surgery/procedure was 
planned prior to study entry; however, if the pre -existing condition deteriorate s unexpectedly during 
the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for 
which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, me ets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (as appropriate) as an 
SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_421019] information):

Adverse Reactions and Serious Adverse Rea ctions
An adverse reaction (AR) implies at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between a 
suspected medicinal product and an AE.  An AR, in contrast to an AE, is characterized by [CONTACT_49392] a 
causal relationship between a medicinal pr oduct and an occurrence is suspected.
Serious adverse reactions (SARs) are defined as all noxious and unintended responses to an 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) related to any dose administered that result in death, are 
life-threatening, require in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], result in 
persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or are a congenital anomaly or birth defect.
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) refers to individual SAE case reports from 
clinical trials where a causal relationship between the SAE and the IMP is suspected by [CONTACT_237460], is not listed in the applicable Reference Safety Information, and meets 
one of the following serious criteria :  results in death, is life -threatening, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_194636], results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is 
a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  All individually reported SARs ar e considered suspected.

subjects, especially wit h history of hallucination and psychosis, are more at risk of exacerbating 
psychotic symptoms even if these are well controlled with antipsychotic medications at Baseline.  
Hallucinations might be prevented by [CONTACT_340231].  Should hallucinations appear during 
this study, standard of care may be applied.  This should include a conservative approach of assessing 
alternative etiologies and addressing them as appropriate and if none are found, waiting a few days to 
see if the phenomenon resolves spontaneously; the ultimate decision on how an individual subject is 
managed during the study, however, is the responsibility of the investigator or designee.
Local tolerability will be assessed.  Infusion site evaluations will be performed at each scheduled clinic 
visit and may be performed at an unscheduled clinic visit.  Any observation of infusion site 
irritation/reaction (> 2 or > C on the infusion site eva luation scale) must be recorded as an AE.  Other 
infusion site -related reactions such as cellulitis/abscess formation, ecchymoses, subcutaneous nodules, 
or scarring should be evaluated and recorded as A Es.  An independent review of moderate and severe 
infusion site -related reactions will be performed.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
Investigators will rate the severity of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe.
Investigators will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject 's 
usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subje ct's usual 
activities and may be incapacitating or life threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of the 
study drug:
Reasonable Possibility –After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest 
a causal relationship.

Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events:  Study Medical Device
Adverse Event
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury or any untoward 
clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, users or other persons whether or 
not related to the investigational medical devi ce.
If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as an SAE within 24 hours after 
the site is made aware of the SAE:
Led to death, injury, or permanent impairment to a body structure of body function
Led to a serious deterioration in the health of a subject that either resulted in:
a life -threatening illness or injury, or
a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or
medical or surgic al intervention to prevent life threatening illness
Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.
A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without a 
serious deterior ation in health, is not considered an SAE.
Adverse Device Effects
Adverse device effects are A Esrelated to the use of an investigational medical device.  This includes any 
AE resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use, the deployment, the 
implantation, the installation, the operation, or any malfunction of the investi gational medical device.  
This includes any event that is a result of a use error or intentional abnormal use of the investigational 
medical device.
Serious Adverse Device Effects
Serious adverse device effects are adverse device effects that have resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of an SAE.
Device Deficiency
A device deficiency is an inadequacy of an investigational medical device related to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance.  This may include malfuncti ons, use error, or inadequacy in 
the information supplied by [CONTACT_3455].
If a device deficiency meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours 
after the site is made aware:

suitable action had not been taken or
intervention had not been made or
circumstances had been less fortunate
New findings/updates in relation to already reported events
Device Causality Assessment
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the reportable device 
event.
Not Related –Relationship to the device can be excluded when:
the event is not a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of a similar 
devices and p rocedures;
the event has not temporal relationship with the use of the investigational device or the 
procedures;
the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known) and is biologica lly implausible;
the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure –when clinically feasible –and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the 
level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serio us event;
the event involves a body site or an organ not expected to be affected by [CONTACT_10398];
the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g., and underlying or concurrent 
illness/clinical condition, an effect of another device, d rug, treatment, or other risk factors);
the event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_340232];
harm to the subject are not clearly due to use error.
In order to establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, 
depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event.
Unlikely –the relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant and/or the event can be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_296469] r cause, but additional information may be obtained.
Possible –the relationship with the use of the investigational device is weak but cannot be ruled out 
completely.  Alternative causes are also possible (e.g., an underlying or concurrent illness/clinica l 
condition or/and an effect of another device, drug, or treatment).  Cases were relatedness cannot be 
assessed or no information has been obtained should also be classified as possible.

Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a s tudy subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_421022] be 
discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject or in the partner of a study subject, 
information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
In the event of pregnancy occurring in a subject 's partner during the study, written informed consent 
from the partner must be obtained prior to collection of any such information.  [COMPANY_013] will provide a 
separate consent form for this purpose.  Pregnancy in a subject 's partner(s) will be collected from the 
date of initiatio n of the infusion through [ADDRESS_421023] be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes awar e of the

7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be fi nalized prior to the interim database lock.  The statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
Sample Size Estimation
Approximately [ADDRESS_421024] 12 months and to meet country requirements.  With 
240 subjects receiving ABBV -951, the probability to observe an AE with an annual incidence rate of 
0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 is 70%, 91%, and 99 %, respectively .
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_421025] 1 efficacy outcome measure.  The Treatment -Naive 
Analysis Set (TNAS) consists of all subjects in the FAS who have the initial exposure to ABBV -951 in 
Study M15 -741, i.e., subjects who had received ABBV -951 in another study prior to participating in 
Study M15 -741 are excluded from the TNAS.
The Safety Anal ysis Set consists of all subjects who receive any ABBV- 951 infusion.
All analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_340234] (low dose or high dose) with a cutoff of [ADDRESS_421026] will be categorized to a dose subgroup based on the average total 
daily dose over the treatment period.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
This is a single -arm, open -label study.  Unless stated otherwise, a ll analyses on efficacy variables will be 
performed with the FAS using data collected no more than 1 day after the end of the infusion of 
ABBV -951.  An exploratory efficacy analysis of normalized daily "Off"time will be conducted on the 
TNAS.  A paired -sample t -test will be performed for testing the change from Baseline.
For all efficacy endpoints, the change from Baseline to each planned visit and to the final visit will be 
summarized in a descriptive manner for each dose subgroup and overall subjects.  T he statistics include 
the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
Safety analyses will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Set.  Safety will be assessed by A Es, the 
Infusion Site Evaluation Scale, laboratory values, vital sign measures, ECGs, and safety scales including

COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
During the COVID -19 pandemic, if it is not possible for all study procedures to be performed as specified 
due to travel restrictions or other reasons, the following modifications are a llowed:
If permitted by [CONTACT_427], the IRB/IEC and the subject, study visits for Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 
13, and 39 may be conducted remotely.  The Enrollment Visit (Day 1), Day 2 visit, Week 26 visit, 
and the Final Week 52/Premature Discontinuation v isit are required to be completed onsite.  It 
is highly recommended that all visits during the Optimization Period (Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 visits) 
be conducted onsite whenever possible.
Some study visits and/or activities may be performed by [CONTACT_648]/remotely.  These are indicated 
by a hashtag (#) in the appropriate visit tables below.
During a phone/remote visit, activities that do not need to be performed are indicated by a 
minus sign ( –).
Scheduled and unscheduled labs may be drawn by a local clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/l aboratory if COVID -[ADDRESS_421047] 
be performed by [CONTACT_82163].
Study visits and/or activities should be performed as scheduled whenever possible.   If it is not 
possible to do so due to the pandemic, the following modifications are allowed:
For Week [ADDRESS_421048] the sponsor.  Subjects should remain on study drug as much as possib le through 
Week 52/Premature Discontinuation.

documentation should indicate that verbal consent was obtained.
Informed consent will be obtained at Screening Visit 1 (V1) as shown in Section 2.
3.2 Eligibility Criteria
All subjects will be evaluated to ensure th ey meet the eligibility criteria at Screening Visits 1 and 2 (V1 
and V2) and prior to enrollment on Day 1 (V3) as shown in Section 2.
3.3 Medical Histor y
A complete medical history, including demographics and histories of alcohol or drug abuse, that in the 
investigator's judgment might impact compliance with study execution, will be taken at Screening Visit 1 
(V1) as shown in Section 2.  Additionally, chronic disorders (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hay fever, 
polyneuropathy) that began prior to Screening Visit 1 (V1) and are still present at Screening Visit 1 (V1) 
should be recorded on the Medical History Form.  The medical history obtained at Screening Visit 1 (V1) 
will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment.  All psychiatric, neurological, behavioral, and/or 
cognitive diagnoses should be reported.  Updates should be made to the medical/neurological/PD 
history with any findings from laboratories, dermatologists, etc. related to the period before initiation of

The investigator or qualified designee will evaluate the infusion site area (abdomen) from Day 1 (V3) 
through the end of the study, as shown in Section 2.
At the time of each evaluation, the following rating scales will be used:2
Irritation –Numeric Grades
0 = No evidence of irritation
1 = Minimal erythema, barely perceptible
2 = Moderate erythema, readily visible; or minimal edema; or minimal papular response
3 = Erythema and papules
4 = Definite edema
5 = Erythema, edema, and p apules
6 = Vesicular eruption
7 = Strong reaction spreading beyond the test site
Irritation –Letter Grades
A = No finding
B = Slight glazed appearance
C = Marked glazing
D = Glazing with peeling and cracking
E = Glazing with fissures
F = Film of dried ser ous exudates covering all or portion of the patch site
G = Small petechial erosions and/or scabs
Any observation of infusion site reaction with irritation criteria > 2 or > C must be recorded as an 
adverse event (AE).
Dermatologic Assessment
If any moderate to severe infusion site related AE, such as cellulitis/abscess formation, ecchymoses, 
subcutaneous nodules, or scarring occurs, or if any infusion site related reaction is assessed with an 
irritation numeric grade equal to 7 on the Infusion Site Evaluation scale, the investigator or designee is 
instructed to do the following, which will be documented in the eCRF:
1.Photograph the skin reaction and follow the appropriate procedure for submission of 
photographs .  In rare situations where an asse ssment or visit cannot be completed onsite due to 
an extenuating event (e.g., COVID -19-related conditions), the subject may be asked to obtain 
and submit a self -captured photograph of the skin reaction.
2.Refer the subject to a dermatologist for comprehensiv e evaluation (including skin biopsy, if 
applicable), treatment, and follow -up per standard practice.  The subject should be referred to a 
dermatologist within [ADDRESS_421052]'s standard practice.

COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the Infusion Site Evaluation (ISE) may be completed remotely via video 
conference at the study visits specified in Section 2(provided the video is of sufficient quality).  If the ISE 
is completed via video conference, the subject will be asked to describe the reaction (swelling, redness, 
etc.).  Further, if the ISE meets the criteria for dermatologic assessment, request that a photo of the 
reaction be provided to the site in ac cordance with local regulations.  AEs should be reported per 
protocol.

Urine specimens will be tested at Screening Visit 1 (V1) as shown in Section 2for the presence of drugs 
of abuse and for alcohol.  The panel for drugs of abuse will minimally include the drugs listed below.  
These analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_340240].  If the screen is 
performed by [CONTACT_779], test kits and the confirmation of positive results will be provided by [CONTACT_11378].  A positive confirmation will result in the subject's exclusion from the study only if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the subject's history of drug abuse could preclude adherence to the 
protocol.  Si milarly, if there is documented proof that the detected drug is appropriately prescribed by a 
physician, the subject might be enrolled in the study.

whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_340241], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_340242].
All AEs will be followed to a satisfactor y conclusion.
See also Section 4.1.
3.9 Prior and Concomitant Medications
Investigators and/or trained site staff will review and record all prior and concomitant medications at 
every visit throughout the study as shown in Section 2.
3.10 Patient -Reported Outcomes
Subjects will complete the self -administered patient -reported outcome (PRO) instruments.  Subjects 
should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the PRO instrument and to provide the 
best possible resp onse to each item.  Clinical study personnel shall not provide interpretation or 
assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  Clinical study personnel will 
encourage completion of the PRO instrument at all specified visits and wi ll ensure that a response is 
entered for all items.
Subjects will also complete rater -administered PRO instruments, such as the Columbia -Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS), the Questionnaire for Impulsive -Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease -
Rating Scale (QUIP -RS), and other assessments.  All applicable clinical, safety, health outcome, and 
cognition assessments will be administered only by [CONTACT_340243].  Every effort 
must be made by [CONTACT_340244] t each subject is rated by [CONTACT_340245]'s participation in the study.
Prior to administration of respective scale(s), designated raters will be trained on and certified (if 
appropriate) in the use of all the scales used in this study.  The objective of this certification/training is 
to ensure uniformity across sites in the administration and scoring of these assessments.
The sponsor, in conjunction with the selected rater training vendor, if applicable, will determine the 
minimum rater qualifications for each of the rating scales.  All raters must meet these qualifications 
prior to participation in the training process.  The names and qualifications of all clinical study personnel 
to be involved in rating scale administration will be submitted for approval upon site selection.  The 
qualifications of the raters will be verified through the training vendor.  Qualified raters will be trained 
and tested for competency and, if they meet established requirements, certified accordingly.  Individual 
exceptions to these requirements must be approved by [CONTACT_340246].
Only those persons who have been trained as raters for this study may rate subjects.  Raters who cannot 
participate in the initial pre -study training or who become involved in the study at a later time will not 
be permitted to perform study ratings until they have satisfactorily completed an individualized training

The PRO assessments are described below.  COVID -19 pandemic -related acceptable protocol 
modifications are described at the end of th is section.
SLATE Device PRO (i.e., rater tablet):  The preferred method is to collect data using direct entry into the 
SLATE device, even when collected remotely.  Paper PROs may be used in certain cases; please discuss 
with the sponsor.  Specifications a re outlined below.
Site rater -administered scales via SLATE Device PRO:  This includes MDS -UPDRS, C -SSRS, QUIP -RS, 
EQ-5D-5L, and PDQ -39, as applicable for each visit.  The qualified rater at the site can conduct those 
assessments remotely as specified by p rotocol except for the MMSE and MDS -UPDRS Part III (Motor 
Examination).  As default, the system does not allow raters to jump to the MDS -UPDRS Part IV without 
having completed Part III.  In this case, "Unable to Rate" is the response choice on the MDS -UPDR S 
Part III that should be used to skip through the questions.
Paper versions of certain scales may be available for remote administration.  Please discuss with the 
sponsor.
Source documentation should clearly indicate how each scale was obtained (e.g., in -person, 
phone, video conference) with time/date noted for each scale and with rater's initials.  Study 
personnel will transfer paper documentation to TrialManager (via SLATE device [i.e., rater 
tablet]) per instructions provided to the study site.
Subject Dosing Diary
Subjects will complete a dosing diary.  The time a new syringe dose is started, changes in the preset 
pump flow rate, self -administered extra dose times, stoppage in therapy (e.g., vial change -out, shower),
replacement of infusion sets, pump errors (e.g., occlusion alarm), and LD+DDCI tablets or levodopa 
inhalation powder self -administered by [CONTACT_340248] 2 consecutive days prior to any study visits (as specified in Section 2).  Additionally, all 
instances of the use of rescue therapy, change in pump flow rates, and self -administered extra doses 
should be documented in the dosing diary throughout the study.  Completed dosing diaries should be 
submitted to the investigator at the first available occasion.
PD Diary
PD Diary Subject Training and Screening Requirements
The subject will be required to have PD Diary training that will include how to understand their PD 
symptomatology and how to complete the PD Diary.  Training will occur during Screening Visit 1 (V1).
Completion of the PD Diary
The core of the PD Diary is the questionnaire that the subject will use to record Parki nsonian symptoms.  
The subject will be prompted to record in the PD Diary whether he/she has been "On," "Off," or 
"Asleep" and what the severity of his/her dyskinesia (troublesome or not troublesome) was.  The PD 
Diary is to be completed for a full [ADDRESS_421055] will be instructed to make an entry upon waking and every

Following the initial PD Diary training during Screening Visit 1 (V1), the subject will complete a PD Diary 
over a minimum of 3 hours for a concordance evaluation while he/she is in the clinic at Screening Visit 1 
(V1) as shown in Section 2.  During this period, the subject must experience at least 1 transition from 
"Off" to "On" or from "On" to "Off," which must be observed by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified rater.  
The investigator or an experienced and medically qualified study site designee (e.g., NP, PA, DO, MD, or 
PhD) assigned by [CONTACT_340249] a separate PD Diary for this period indicating their
assessment of the subject's motor state.  There must be at least 75% concordance between the subject's 
PD Diary and the PD Diary completed by [CONTACT_27404].  If no transition from 
"Off" to "On" or from "On" to "Off" occurs during the time of concordance evaluation and/or the 
concordance is lower than 75%, the concordance testing may be prolonged at the discretion of the 
investigator or designee.  If the concordance is less than 75%, the subject will undergo re -training of PD 
Diary completion and repeat the concordance evaluation at Screening Visit 2 (V2).  Subjects previously 
enrolled in Study M15 -739, for whom recognizable/identifiable "Off" and "On" state (motor 
fluctuations) have been already established and confirmed do not need to complete the concordance 
test.  The PD diary concordance test may also be omitted for subjects for whom 
recognizable/ identifiable "Off" and "On"state (motor fluctuations) have been already established and 
confirmed, and for unforeseen circumstances, require rescreening.
EuroQol 5 -Dimension Questionnaire
The EuroQol 5 -dimension questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L) is a standardized instrument developed by [CONTACT_340250] a measure of health- related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health 
conditions and treatments.  The EQ -5D-5L consists of 2 parts:  the EQ -5D descriptive system and the EQ 
visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).
The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions:  mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety/depression.  Impairment in each of the 5 dimensions is measured on a 5 -level scale, where 
1= no problems, 2 = slight problems, 3 = moderate problems, 4 = severe problems, and 5 = extreme 
problems.  The patient is asked to rate his/her current health by [CONTACT_340251] 5 dimensions.  The patie nt's overall 
health can be described as a single number (formed by [CONTACT_340252] 5 dimensions) that ranges from [ZIP_CODE] (full health/ no problems) to [ZIP_CODE] (extreme 
impairment in all dimensions).  The health s tatus is converted to an index value using a country -specific 
weighted scoring algorithm.  The index value for the [LOCATION_002] (US) ranges from a worst score of
–0.[ADDRESS_421057] score of 1.
In addition, the patient is also asked to self -rate their curren t health on a vertical visual analogue scale 
(VAS).  The scale ranges from 0 (labelled as "the worst health you can imagine") to 100 (labelled as "the 
best health you can imagine").  The VAS provides a complementary approach to the descriptive system 
for q uantifying the patient's health based on their own judgment.

Columb ia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The C- SSRS is a systematically administered instrument designed to assess suicidal behavior and 
ideation, track and assess all suicidal events, and assess the lethality of attempts.  Additional features 
assessed include fre quency, duration, controllability, reason for ideation, and deterrents.
Answering "yes"to question 4 and/or question [ADDRESS_421058] evaluate the subjects immediately and consider 
whether they remain suitable for participation in the study.  The [COMPANY_013] therapeutic area medical 
director (TA MD) should be notified immediately.
Under no circumstances should a subject who has positively endorsed or expressed suicidal ideation be 
left alone, be allowed to exit the site, or go home before a qualified medical professional has evaluated 
the subject's risk.
A qualified rater will administer the C -SSRS at the visits specified in Section 2.  The C -SSRS will be 
administered prior to initiation of the continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) of ABBV -951 on Day 1 
(V3).
Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire
The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ -39) is a disease -specific instrument designed to measure 
aspects of health that are relevant to subjects with PD, and which may not be included in general health 
status quest ionnaires.  Each item is scored on the following 5 -point scale:  0 = never, 1 =occasionally, 
2 =sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = always (or cannot do at all, if applicable).
Higher scores are consistently associated with more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremors 
and stiffness.  The results are presented as 8 discrete domain scores and as a summary index.  The 
PDQ -39 domain scores and summary index range from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better 
perceived health status.
A qualified rater will administer the PDQ -39 at the visits specified in Section 2.  The PDQ -39 will be 
administered prior to initiation of the CSCI of ABBV -951 on Day 1 (V 3).
Movement Disorder Society -Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
The Movement Disorder Society -Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS -UPDRS) is an 
investigator- used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of PD.  Every effort should be m ade by [CONTACT_340253]'s participation 
in the study.  The MDS -UPDRS assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_10060], trained rater.  To be 
qualified by [CONTACT_340254], all raters must have participated in the rater training and 
have a current valid rater certificate.
The MDS- UPDRS consists of the following sections:
Part I: Non -Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living (nM -EDL)

Part III: Motor Examination (including Hoehn and Yahr stage)
Part IV: Motor Complications
Some sections require that multiple grades be assigned to each extremity.  The MDS -UPDRS total score 
(Parts I -III) ranges from [ADDRESS_421059] (total) disability, and 0 representing no 
disability.
For the duration of the study, the MDS -UPDRS will be administered in the subjects' best "On" state with 
the exception of Day 1 (V3).  Before starting the infusion of the investigational drug, subjects will initially 
complete the MDS -UPDRS Part III in a practically defined "Off" state (i.e., without having taken any 
anti- PD medication since the evening of the day before the visit).  The assessment should be repeated 
after initiation of the infusion during the subject's best "On" state, which should be 1 to 2 hours after 
the beginning of the ABBV -951 infusion.  If possible, the MDS -UPDRS should be done at the same time of 
day at each visit throughout the trial by a qua lified rater.  At all indicated visits specified in Section 2, a 
complete MDS -UPDRS (Parts I through IV) will be done during "On" time.
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
In countries where a validated translation of the MDS -UPDRS scale is not available, the Unified 
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) version will instead be used.
The UPDRS is an investigator -used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of PD.  Every effort 
should be made by [CONTACT_340255]'s participation in the study.  The UPDRS assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_340256], train ed rater.  To be qualified by [CONTACT_340254], all raters must have 
participated in rater training and have a current valid rater certificate.
The UPDRS consists of the following sections:
Part I Mentation, Behavior, and Mood
Part II Activ ities of Daily Living
Part III Motor Examination
Part IV Complications of Therapy (including dyskinesias)
Part V Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging
For the duration of the study, the UPDRS will be administered in the subject's best "On" state with the 
except ion of Day 1 (V3).  Before starting the infusion of the investigational drug, subjects will initially 
complete the UPDRS Part III in a practically defined "Off" state (i.e., without having taken any anti- PD 
medication since the evening of the day before th e visit).  The assessment should be repeated after 
initiation of the infusion during the subject's best "On" state, which should be 1 to 2 hours after the 
beginning of the ABBV -951 infusion.  If possible, the UPDRS should be done at the same time of day at
each visit throughout the trial by a qualified rater.  At all indicated visits specified in Section 2, a

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), which has been modified to the PDSS -2.  The purpose of the PDSS -2 is to 
characterize the various aspects of nocturnal sleep problems in patients with PD.  The PDSS- 2 
instrument has been shown to be reliable, valid, precise, and a potentially treatment responsive tool for 
measuring nocturnal disabilities and sleep disorders in PD.  The PDSS -2 consists of 15 questions that 
evaluate motor and non -motor symptoms at night and upon wakening, as well as disturbed sleep 
grouped into 3 domains:  motor symptoms at night (5 items), PD symptoms at night (5 items), and 
disturbed sleep (5 items).  Specifically, the questions assess overall sleep quality, insomnia, sleep 
fragmentation, restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic leg movements of sleep (PLMS) , rapid eye 
movement behavior disorder (RBD), hallucinations, nocturia, nocturnal immobility, pain and cramps, 
morning akinesia, tremor, and sleep apnea.  The PDSS -2 was developed from the PDSS based upon the 
need for a treatment measuring tool containing PD-specific sleep disorders; the instrument was 
extended to address specific sleep disturbances such as RLS, akinesia, pain, and sleep apnea.  Daytime

To increase ease of use, the visual analogue scale of the PDSS was transformed into a frequency 
measure in the PDSS -2.  The frequency is assessed for the 15 sleep problems based on a 5 -point 
Likert -type scale (ranging from 0 [never] to 4 [very often] with the exception of Question 1 s core ranging 
from 0 [very often] to 4 [never]).  Scores are calculated for each domain as well as a total score.  The 
recall period is for the past week.
A qualified rater will administer the PDSS- 2 at the visits specified in Section 2.  The PDSS -2 will be 
administered prior to initiation of the CSCI of ABBV -951 on Day 1 (V3).
Mini- Mental State Examination
The Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a brief, [ADDRESS_421061] a score 
≥24 at Screening Visit 1 (V1) to be eligible for study participation.  Subjects with MMSE scores 19 to 23 
inclusive may still be enrolled in the study if, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the cognitive impairment does 
not preclude the subject from completing study -required procedures.  Subjects with moderate or severe 
impairment (MMSE scores of 18 or below) may not be enrolled.  A qualified rater will administer the 
MMSE at Screening Visit 1 (V1) as show n in Section 2.
Questionnaire for Impulsive -Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease -Rating Scale
The QUIP -RS is a brief, self -completed or rat er-administered rating scale to assess the severity of 
symptoms of impulse control disorders (ICDs) and related behaviors reported to occur in PD.  In this 
study, QUIP -RS will be rater administered.  The QUIP -RS can also aid in supporting a diagnosis of IC Ds 
and related disorders in PD.  The QUIP -RS uses a 5 -point Likert scale that requires individuals to rate the 
severity of each symptom based on its frequency.  The potential advantages to using a rating scale 
include detection of subsyndromal behaviors, establishment of clear cutoff points with a good balance 
between sensitivity and specificity, and the ability to monitor changes in symptoms over time.
The QUIP -RS has 4 primary questions (pertaining to commonly reported thoughts, urges/desires, and 
behavio rs associated with ICDs), each applied to the 4 ICDs (compulsive gambling, buying, eating, and

Likert scale (score 0 –4 for each question) to gauge the fr equency of behaviors, and instructs patients to 
answer questions based on behaviors that occurred in the preceding 4 weeks (or any 4 -week period in a 
designated time frame).  The QUIP -RS is administered with an instruction sheet that provides examples 
of the behaviors being assessed and a brief description of the Likert scale categories for frequency 
(i.e., never [0] = not at all, rarely [1] = infrequently or 1 day/week, etc.).  Scores for each ICD and related 
disorder range from 0 to 16, with a higher scor e indicating greater severity (i.e., frequency) of 
symptoms.  Due to overlap, hobby[CONTACT_340257] a 
single diagnosis (hobby[CONTACT_128053] -punding), with a total score ranging from 0 to 32 for the combined disorder.  
The total QUIP -RS score for all ICDs and related disorders combined ranges from 0 to 112.
The behaviors can be described as:
(i) Gambling (casinos, internet gambling, lotteries, scratch tickets, betting, or slot or poker machines);
(ii) Sex (making sexual demands on others, promiscuity, prostitution, change in sexual orientation, 
masturbation, internet or telephone sexual activities, or pornography);
(iii) Buying (too much of the same thing or things that you don't need or use);
(iv) Eating (eating larger amounts or different types of food than in the past, more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_340186], 
until feeling uncomfortably full, or when not hungry);
(v) Hobby[CONTACT_128053] (specific tasks, hobbies or other organized activities, such as writing, painting, gardening, 
repairing or dismantling things, collectin g, computer use, working on projects, etc.);
(vi) Punding (repeating certain simple motor activities, such as cleaning, tidying, handling, examining, 
sorting, ordering, collecting, hoarding, or arranging objects, etc.);
(vii) Medication use (consistently taking too much of your Parkinson's medications, or increasing on your 
own, without medical advice, your overall intake of Parkinson's medications)
The frequency of behaviors are described as never (0) = not at all, rarely; (1) = infrequently or 
1day/week; sometimes (2) = at times or 2 to 3 days/week; often (3) = most of the time or 
4 – 5days/week; very often (4) = nearly always or 6 -7 days/week.
A qualified rater will administer the QUIP -RS at the times described in Section 2.
Parkinson's KinetiGraph
Developed by [CONTACT_340258], the Parkinson's KinetiGraph™ system (PKG™ or Personal 
KinetiGraph™ as it is known in the US), is an innovative mobile he alth technology.  The PKG™ provides 
continuous, objective, ambulatory assessment of the symptoms of PD including tremor, bradykinesia, 
and dyskinesia.  The PKG™ also provides an assessment of daytime somnolence and an indication of 
propensity for impulsive behaviors.  The PKG™ system consists of a wrist -worn movement recording 
device known as the PKG™ -Watch, proprietary algorithms, and a data -driven report known as the PKG™.  
Data are collected continuously by [CONTACT_340259]™ -Watch during activities of daily livin g in the home 
environment.  The PKG™ -Watch should be worn by [CONTACT_340260] 
a week (e.g., the night of the 7th day, every week).  The data are uploaded for processing at the time of 
recharging.
As allowed by [CONTACT_54019], subjects will receive the PKG -watch following Visit 1 (V1), after being 
received by [CONTACT_3452], and prior to the Monitoring Period.  The Monitoring Period can occur any 
time before V3, as long as it lasts for 6 consecutive days.  Subjects will be required to wear the 
PKG-watch (refer to the currently approved manufacturer's directions) for at least the [ADDRESS_421062] the Week 26 Visit (V11); thereafter, wearing of the

references throughout this protocol and its appendices.  The [COMPANY_013] TA MD should be consulted if, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], there are circumstances that might interfere with t he use of the PKG 
device (e.g., religious reasons, atopic dermatitis).  A subject's inability to wear the PKG watch, due to 
logistics hindering the watch from being made available, will not preclude him/her from study 
participation.  During the 6 -day Monit oring Period, subjects should be active (engaged in usual activities 
of daily living and not sitting or resting on a couch or chair or lying in bed) for at least [ADDRESS_421063]'s responses.  The subject's ability to view the PRO to 
understand the questions and response options should be preserved.  Sites may share the questionnaire 
by [CONTACT_340261] (email or hard copy) to the subjects to allow them to 
read/understand the questions and responses when the subject is providing responses over the phone.  
The date and time of PRO data collection should be recorded along with the name [CONTACT_340267].
3.11 Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples for clinical laboratory tests will be collected at the visits specified in Section 2.  The Day 1 (V3) 
samples will be collected prior to initiation of the CSCI of ABBV -951.  The last laboratory test results 
prior to initiation of the CSCI will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment for a particular test.
A certifi ed central laboratory will be used to process and provide results for the clinical laboratory tests.  
Laboratory reference ranges will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study.  Follow -up safety 
laboratory tests may be performed by a certified labo ratory other than the site's local laboratory.

b. Special laboratory tests to detect vitamin deficiencies, i.e., vitamin B 12, vitamin B 6, folic acid, homocysteine, and MMA 
levels will be performed at Screening Visit 1 (V1), on Day 1 (V3 ), and at Week 6 (V9), Week 26 (V11), and Week 52 (V13).  
An abnormal vitamin B 12level of questionable clinical significance (indeterminate or low normal results at Screening Visit 1

prior to entry into the study.  If, at any time during the study, a subject displays symptoms of polyneuropathy, the 
investigator must perform this laboratory panel and any other assessment that the investigator feels is appropriate for 
further evaluation of polyneuropathy symptoms.
If a laboratory test value is outside the reference range and the investigator considers the laboratory 
result to be clinically significant, the investigator will:
repeat the test to verify the out -of-range value;
follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory clinical resolution; or

case, the laboratory result will be recorded as an AE.
All laboratory abnormalities that occ ur during the study must be evaluated by [CONTACT_318039] a new disease process, an exacerbation or worsening of an existing condition, 
or require further action and therefore may need to be reported as AEs.  Accordingly, for any values 
outside of the reference range, the investigator will indicate on the report if the result is clinically 
significant or not clinically significant.  If a laboratory abnormality meets criteria for a potentially 
clinically significant (PCS) labora tory value, the investigator must either report an associated AE or 
document in source the reason(s) the finding was not considered an AE.  See Appendix A.
Any laboratory value that remains abnormal at premature discontinuation/end of study and was judged 
to be clinically significant will be followed according to accepted medical standards until resolution of 
the abnormality.
Serum and Urine Pregnancy Tests
A pregnant or breastfeeding female subject will not be eligible for participation or continuation in this 
study.
Pregnancy testing is not required for females of non -childbearing potential.  Determination of 
post -menopausal status will be made during the Screening Period based on the subject's history.
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at V1 and a urine pregnancy test will be performed as shown 
in Section 2for all women of childbearing potential.  The urine sample for the Day 1 (V3) urine 
pregnancy test will be collected prior to initiation of the CSCI of ABBV -951.
The serum pregnancy test will be performed by [CONTACT_2237].  Ur ine pregnancy tests will be 
performed and analyzed at the site during the study visit if there is a scheduled visit.  If there is not a 
scheduled visit, subjects may either have a pregnancy test at the site as an unscheduled visit or at home 
with a pregnan cy test kit provided by [CONTACT_779].  If a urine pregnancy test is performed at home, site 
personnel will contact [CONTACT_340262] -related pregnancy tests and record 
these results in the source records only.  If a urine pregnanc y test is positive, the results should be 
confirmed with a serum hCG test that will be performed by [CONTACT_2237].
If the serum pregnancy test at V1 is positive, the subject is considered a screen failure.  If the result of 
the serum pregnancy tes t is borderline, it should be repeated to determine eligibility.
If the pregnancy test is:
Positive after the serum pregnancy confirmation, the subject is considered a screen failure;
Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the study;
Still borderline, the [COMPANY_013] TA MD should be consulted.

should be o btained along with reference ranges and kept within the subjects' source documentation.  
The investigator should review local laboratory results as soon as possible.
If laboratory samples cannot be obtained, study drug administration may be continued provi ded the 
investigator has reviewed all prior laboratory results and confirms and discusses with the subject that 
there is no safety concern for the subject to continue use of the study drug in the absence of current 
labs.  The subject should be scheduled for laboratory draws as soon as feasible.

primary reason for discontinuation of study drug or study participation.  The informatio n will be 
recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) page; however, these procedures should 
not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator 
feels are necessary to treat the subject 's condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject 
will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or 
not the subject decides to continue participation in the study.
3.13 Biomarker Sampling
Optional samples for biomarker testing will be collected at the visits specified in Section 2.  All samples 
should be labeled and shipped as outlin ed in the study -specific laboratory manual.
3.14 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
Single electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be recorded at the visits specified in Section 2after the subject has 
been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes.  Subjects will be instructed to remain stationary (no talking, laughing, 
deep breathing, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or swallowing) for approximately 10 seconds during the ECG recording.  When 
an ECG is re corded at a time near that of a blood collection, the ECG should be obtained prior to the

will evaluate a single ECG lead (Lead II, with V5 or V2 [in that order] evaluated if L ead II cannot be 
evaluated).  Heart rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval will be measured for each 
ECG with 3 to 5 beats.  QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) will be determined using Fridericia's 
correction method (QTcF).
The central reader will also provide the interpretation of the ECG (i.e., "normal" or "abnormal").  The 
central ECG laboratory will send the ECG report to the site within 3 business days.  The investigator (or 
physician designee) will review the central reader's report/assessment and document his/her review by 
[CONTACT_340263].  Only the central ECG laboratory's data will be 
collected into the database.  The investigator should review and reconcile if necessary his/her 
interpretation of the ECG (normal/abnormal) with the central ECG laboratory in case of relevant 
divergent assessments and reconcile as he/she determines is appropriate.
The original ECG tracing and the central reader's interpretation, each with the investigator's signature 
[CONTACT_3670], will be retained in the subject's records at the study site as source documents.
COVID -[ADDRESS_421067].
3.15 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be collected for both clino and orthostatism (supi[INVESTIGATOR_135456]).  For clino vital signs, 
blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured after the subject has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_421068] has been standing for 2 minutes.  When vital 
sign measurements are scheduled at the same time as a blood collection, vi tal sign measurements 
should be obtained prior to blood collection.
Vital signs will be measured at the visits specified in Section 2.  Orthostatic vital signs will be measured 
on Day 1 (V3), and at Week 1 (V5), Week 6 (V9), Week 26 (V11), and Week 52 (V13) (or premature 
discontinuation).  Vital signs on Day 1 (V3) will be measured after initiation of the CSCI of ABBV -[ADDRESS_421069]'s source documentation.

A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening Visit 1 (V1), on Day 1 (V3 ), and at 
Week 6 (V9), Week 26 (V11), and Week 52 (V13) as shown in Section 2.  The physical examination 
performed at Screening Visit 1 (V1) will serve as the baseline physical examination for clinical 
assessment.  A symptom -directed physical examination will be performed at each following visit when 
necessary.  Any significant physical examination findings after dosing will be recorded as AEs .
3.18 Neurological Examination
A neurological examination will be performed at the visits shown in Section 2.  Neurological findings 
beyond those rela ted to PD should be reported in the eCRF.  The neurological examination performed at 
Screening Visit 1 (V1) will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment.  Any significant neurological 
findings after dosing will be recorded as AEs.
The neurological ex amination will consist of the following:
Mental status –assessment of orientation, speech, and memory.
Cranial nerves –assessment of cranial nerves II –XII, including a funduscopic examination.
Motor system –assessment of tone and strength .
Sensory sys tem –brief survey for light touch and temperature.
Reflexes –assessment of deep tendon reflexes and plantar responses (Babinski sign).
Coordination –assessment of upper and lower extremities.

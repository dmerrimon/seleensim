1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Background  
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death. The lifetime risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_284911] 6%, and almost half of those affected will die of  
the disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_284912], CRC is a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality.  In screening procedures for CRC such as 
sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and radiography, it is important that the colon be 
thorough ly purged and cleansed. In particular, it is essential that as much fecal matter 
and fluids as possible be removed from the colon to permit adequate visualization of 
the intestinal mucosa.  
 
 Preliminary Experience with the Similar Bowel Preparation s 
 
Two Phase 3 studies were conducted comparing BLI800 (SUPREP) to the FDA 
approved preparation MoviPrep1. The BLI800 -301 study evaluated BLI800 as a one -
day preparation, completed on the day prior to colonoscopy. The BLI800 -302 study 
utilized a two -day (or “spli t-dose”) regimen in which half the preparation was taken the 
evening prior to colonoscopy, and the remaining half completed on the morning of the 
procedure.  
 
The primary efficacy analysis in both Phase [ADDRESS_784075] to cleansing efficacy (cumulative data 
shown below in Table 1).

performed in the 302 study, produces markedly superior cleansing results over  a one 
day preparation, as in the 301 study. In each study and overall, BLI800 achieved a 
greater number of excellent preparations than MoviPrep. This difference resulted in a 
higher Mean Preparation Score for BLI800, reaching statistical significance (p =  0.049) 
in the total population.

Adverse events were also evaluated in the Phase 3 studies. The only treatment emergent 
adverse event category with a frequ ency greater than 3% was gastrointestinal (BLI800 = 
4.5% and MoviPrep = 4.3% ).  The expected symptoms of nausea and vomiting were the 
most frequent (1.3% each) within the gastrointestinal category.  There was no difference 
between BLI800 and MoviPrep in th e frequency of any treatment -emergent adverse 
events, including those that were gastrointestinal in origin.  No clinically significant 
differences between groups were seen in laboratory testing of  serum chemistry and 
hematology. At the one month follow -up visit, no change in serum creatinine was 
observed for BLI800 patients.  
 
A smaller Phase 3 study (n = 136) was conducted comparing the safety and efficacy of 
SUPREP (in the FDA approved split -dose regimen) to NuLYTELY2. In addition to 
preparation success ( as defined above), the blinded colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_284913]. As shown below in Tables [ADDRESS_784076] colon segments (most importantly

to adverse events were detected in the elderly population or overall.  The number of 
events expected with gastrointestinal cleansing agents (e.g. nausea, bloating and 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) was insignificant. Differences in la boratory results were considered by 
[CONTACT_284921].  
 
The BLI800 -301 and BLI800 -302 studies supported the FDA’s determination that 
SUPREP was safe and effective i n adults undergoing colonoscopy, leading to its FDA 
approval in August 2010.  
 
As a condition of the SUPREP approval, FDA required Braintree Laboratories to 
conduct several post marketing studie s in order to further demonstrate the safety of 
SUPREP in special populations (the elderly, and those with renal or hepatic 
impairment)  and to look for rare occurring serious adverse events . In study BLI800 -
440 (PMR 1580 -7), patients in special populations (renal/hepatic/elderly) took 
SUPREP prior to colonoscopy and were followed for 6 months. 184 patients took 
SUPREP in this stu dy, which also included non -special population patients  (e.g. 
patients undergoing screening colonoscopy) . SUPREP was shown to be safe in all of 
these patient groups in near term and long term follow up, comparable to the 
GoLYTELY comparator used in the stu dy.  
 
Studies BLI800 -430 and BLI800 -431 (PMR 1580 -8) evaluated the safety of SUPREP 
in special populations (renal/hepatic/elderly) through repeated ECG measurements. A 
total of 37 patients completed the study and no significant ECG changes were seen 
after patients took two SUPREP doses 2 hours apart (acute administration).  
 
For study BLI800 -450 (PMR 1580 -6), a large retrospective review of electronic 
medical records and insurance claims was conducted to tabulate the rates of specific 
serious adverse events  (e.g. cardiac events, rental failure, ischemic colitis) occurring 
within [ADDRESS_784078] been introduced. HalfLytely and 
Bisacodyl Tablet Bowel Pre p Kit (bisacodyl plus SF -ELS) and Osmoprep (sodium 
phosphate) were approved by [CONTACT_594306] a partial tablet (HalfLytely) or full tablet 
regimen (Osmoprep). Due to the known safety risks of sodium phosphate3, 
development of a safe and effective full tablet reg imen is warranted.  
 
An uncontrolled, open -label pi[INVESTIGATOR_594295]4700, a novel tablet formulation of the active sulfate ingredients of SUPREP. The 
preparation was given in the FDA preferred split -dose (PM/AM) re gimen, each dose 
consisting of 12 tablets with additional water. The total water given with each 12 tablet 
dose was 16 ounces, followed by [CONTACT_1192] 16 ounces glasses after each  dose (similar to 
SUPREP) .  
Twenty subjects were enrolled at a single center. One sub ject withdrew consent prior to 
taking the tablets. Subject reporting of preparation related symptoms showed similar 
levels of crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], bloating an d nausea with BLI4700 compared t o historic SUPREP  
levels1. No serious advents occurred in the study. Two subj ects (11%) reported vomiting, 
which is consistent with SUPREP and other approved bowel preparations1,2.

6. Volume of water used to improve visualization  (investigator’s will need 
to specify cases where a water immersion technique was utiliz ed) 
 
4.7. Pregnancy  
Subjects that are f emale and of childbea ring potential must have a serum  pregnancy 
test done at screening. A positive result will rule out the participation of the  subject 
in the study.  
 
Female study s ubject s must be surgically sterilized or  use oral contraceptives, depot 
contraceptives, double -barrier method, intrauterine device, or testify that she is 
monogamous with a vasectomized partner, or practices abstinence and will continue 
to do so during the duration of study.  Subjects practicing abstinence must agree to 
use an acceptable form of birth control should they become sexually active during 
the study. Women who are post menopausal (as defined in this section), or have had 
a partial or total hysterectomy or tubal ligation are not consider ed of child bearing 
potential.  
 
Oral contraceptives, hormone implants, and injections should be stable for  at least [ADDRESS_784098] been absent for 12 months in a 
woman of appropriate age (usually 45 to 55 years) who has no other suspected or 
identified cause of amenorrhea . 
 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the subject must be removed from 
the study and followed until one month after the end of the preg nancy.   A pregnancy 
will not be recorded as an adverse event .

The use of concomitant medication will be recorded from 7 days prior to screeni ng 
until completion of the study , including sedation medications  and intravenous fluids 
administered  during colonoscopy.  Laxatives  should not be used within 72 hours of 
beginning the study preparation .    
 
5. ADVERSE EVENTS  
5.1. Adverse Event Definition and Reporting  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use  
of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant  abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (in vestigational) product.  Subjects will be queried for any problems they 
experienced during and after preparation by [CONTACT_8786].  Any symptom on the 
symptom scale rated as mild, moderate or severe  must be reported as an adverse 
event. Colonoscopy and bio psy findings are not considered adverse events unless 
considered by [CONTACT_594308] .  
 
Any blood pressure result that is deemed clinically signifi cant and not present at 
Visit [ADDRESS_784099] date/time of report, date/time of onset, description of the 
adverse event, severity of adverse event, action(s) tak en regarding treatment of the

Version dated  4-5-18  Page 28 of 40 event, action(s) taken regarding study participation, duration of adverse event, and 
the Investigator's assessment of relationship of adverse event to study preparation .  
 
The Investigator should assess  the severity of each ad verse event  using the following 
categories:  
Grade  Severity  Description  
1 Mild  Barely noticeable, does not influence functioning  
causing no limitations of usual activities  
2 Moderate  Makes participant uncomfortable, influences functioning  
causing some li mitations of usual activities  
3 Severe  Severe discomfort, treatment needed  
Severe and undesirable, causing inability to carry out usual  
Activities  
4 Life 
threatening  Immediate risk of death , Life threatening or disabling  
(Must be reported as serious adve rse event ) 
5 Fatal  Causes death of the participant  
(Must be reported as serious adverse event)   
 
 
The Investigator should assess the relationship to study drug for each adverse event 
using  the following categories:  
Categories of 
Attribution:  Description  
UNRELATED  There is no evidence of any causal relationship.  
POSSIBLE  There is some  evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of 
the trial medication). However, the influence of other  factors 
may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the subject ’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events).  
PROBABLE  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely . 
DEFINITE  There is clear  evidence t o suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out .

BLI4700  
Because BLI4700 tablets contain the same active ingredient (sodium sulfate) as 
SUPREP, a similar adverse event profile is expecte d. In Phase [ADDRESS_784100] frequent adverse events reported by [CONTACT_284926] (reported by >3% 
of patients) included overall discomfort, abdominal pain and distension, nausea, and 
vomiting.

In a Phase [ADDRESS_784101] frequent adverse events reported by [CONTACT_594309]  (reported by > 2% 
of patients) included malaise, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting , upper abdominal 
pain and dyspepsia4.  
 
6. SERIOUS ADVERSE REACT IONS AND DISCONTINUATION OF 
STUDY  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in 
at least one of the following outcomes:  
 
- Results in death  
- Is life -threatening  
- Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
- A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
- Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment 
or damage  
 
 SAE collection will coincide with the patient providing informed consent to 
participate in the study and will conclude 30 days after preparation exposure . Pre-

termination from the study. The study may be halted if at any time an Investigator or 
Braintree Laboratories deems the incidence or severity of adverse events to be 
unacceptable.  
 
8.2. Subjects Disconti nued from the Study  
Subjects may be discontinued  from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• An adverse event requiring discontinuation (including failure to tolerate study 
medication).  
• Female participants who become pregnant during the study period.  
• Major protocol deviation from the study design by [CONTACT_594310]  
• Subject chooses to withdraw from the study, for whatever reason.  
• Subject is lost to follow -up. 
• The Sponsor initiates an early discontinuation of  the study.  
• The subject is withdrawn at the discretion of the Investigator.

the study that are listed in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE, version 4.0) under the system organ classes (SOCs) of Cardiac Disorders, 
Renal and Urinary Disorders and Metabolism and Nutri tion Disorders will be reviewed 
as part of the study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].

and Urinary, a nd Metabolism and Nutrition SOCs of Grade 3, or if a single subject 
develops one of the listed adverse reactions of Grade 4 or higher.  
 
9. DATA ANALYSIS  
9.1. Study Endpoints - Efficacy  
Primary efficacy will be assessed on the basis of a binary outcome of overall 
preparation success or failure. For statistical analyses, the followin g definition of 
preparation success and failure will be used:  
 
Definition of successful preparation:  
1. Overall Cleansing Assessment by [CONTACT_8779][INVESTIGATOR_541] (Section 4. 6.2) of 
“Excellent” or “Good” and does not satisfy any of the following failure criteria.    
 
Definition of failed preparation:  
1. Overall Cleansing Assessment of “Fair” or “Poor” by [CONTACT_8779][INVESTIGATOR_541]  
2. Any subject who did not have a colonoscopy based on the Investigator’s 
assessment of the cleansing ( subject report of insufficient fecal output, 
uncle ar fecal discharge, etc.) or due to preparation related adverse events.  
3. Any subject for whom cleaning was not adequate for evaluation  
 
Unevaluable Subject s: 
Subjects who were dispensed a kit but withdrew from the study prior to taking any 
preparation (incl uding subjects who were disqualified subsequent to Visit 1 based on 
screening laboratory results) are excluded from the efficacy and safety analyses. Any 
subject who completely or partially took study preparation but did not have a 
colonoscopy due to non -preparation related reasons (e.g. lack of insurance, inability 
to return for colonoscopy) will not be included in the efficacy analyses. All treated 
subjects will be included in the safety analysis.  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI4700 -[ADDRESS_784103] result (p -value) for treatment difference 
will be presented together with a two -sided 95% confidence interval for the 
difference.  
 
Null Hypothesis H0: P1 −P2≤D0 versus Alternative Hypothe sis H1: P1 −P2>D0, 
 
where P1 is the success probability in the BLI4700 group , P2 is the success 
probability in the MoviPrep  group (reference or control group) , and D0 is the 
acceptable margin of equivalence , which we set  equal to  −10%.  
 
If necessary, we w ill pool the smallest centers into a “small -centers” stratum until 
each treatment arm in the smallest stratum has at least ten subjects.  
 
If the test for non -inferiority is statistically significant, we will conduct a test of the 
superiority hypothesis:  
 
Null Hypothesis H0: P1 −P2<=0 versus Alt ernative Hypothesis H1: P1 −P2>[ADDRESS_784104] the alpha lev els of the tests for multiplicity . 
 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed for th e primary endpoint based on stratification 
groups outlined in Section 4.1.2.  
 
Additional efficacy endpoints will include:  
• Cleansing score by [CONTACT_8791]  
• Number (%) of excellent pr eparations overall and by [CONTACT_8791]  
• Adequacy of cleaning and need for re -preparation  
• Duration of colonoscopy  
• Volume of intraprocedural water needed to irrigate the colon  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI4700 -301 
Version dated  4-5-18  Page 34 of 40 • Number (%) of procedures that reached the cecum  
• Time to cecum  
 
Secondary endpoints will  be analyzed in a manner similar to the primary analysis 
using the CMH test adjusting for site effects for count (percentage) outcomes and 
two-way ANOVA with terms for treatment, site, and their interaction for continuous 
responses. No adjustment will be m ade for multiplicity in testing the secondary 
endpoints.  P values will be presented for hypothesis tests, and two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals for estimates of treatment effects.  
 
 
9.2. Study Endpoints - Safety  
Adverse Events:  
All subjects who took preparati on in any amount will be included in the safety 
analysis. All adverse events will be analyzed based on the principle of treatment 
emergence. A sign or symptom will be regarded as treatment -emergent if it was 
present prior to the first dose and subsequently  worsened in severity, or was not 
present prior to the first dose but subsequently appeared.  
 
In order to define treatment emergence for events with missing start or stop dates the 
following additional criteria will be used:  
• if both the onset and resolutio n dates for a particular event are missing, then 
the event is considered treatment -emergent;  
• if the onset date for an event is missing and the resolution date falls after the 
initiation of the first dose, then the event is considered treatment -emergent;  
• if the onset date for an event falls after the initiation of the first dose and the 
resolution date is missing or  present, then the event is considered treatment -
emergent; and  
• if the onset date for an event falls before the initiation of the first dose and t he 
stop date is missing or  present, then the event is not considered treatment -
emergent.  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI4700 -301 
Version dated  4-5-18  Page 35 of 40  
Adverse events will be collected using MedDRA category designations for body 
system and preferred term. The number and percent of subjects who experienced 
each advers e event will be presented in a tabular form.  Individual tables will be 
provided for treatment -emergent adverse events, treatment -emergent adverse events 
by [CONTACT_8792], and treatment -emergent adverse events by [CONTACT_926]. 
The difference in ad verse events between study populations will be tested by [CONTACT_8793]’s exact test together with a 95% confidence interval for the treatment effect 
estimate.  
 
 
Vitals Signs and Physical Examination:  
Vital signs and physical examination data will be summarize d with descriptive 
statistics.  
 
Laboratory Data:  
Results of laboratory tests for the change from baseline (Screening) and treatment 
group differences will be tested using ANOVA.  In addition, shift tables will be 
presented to describe changes in lab parame ter values between screening and post -
treatment time points using normal range categories (low, normal, high).  
 
Symptom Scale  Data : 
Symptom Scale  data for individual symptoms for Overall Experience ( stomach  
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], stomach bloating, n ausea  and vomiting ) will be presented categorically by 
[CONTACT_8794] -Square test.  
 
9.3. Sample Size  
Approximately  five hundred and forty (540) subjects will be randomly assigned via 
the minimization scheme to one of two preparations in a ratio of 1:1 ( 270 subjects 
per group) and undergo colonoscopy. Based on prior studies using a similar grading 
system, the success rate for MoviPrep  is expected to be approximately  94%1. 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI4700 -301 
Version dated  4-5-18  Page 36 of 40 Assuming a success rate for BLI4700  of approximately 90% , a two -sided asymptotic 
confidence  interv al for the difference in success rates between groups (BLI4700 – 
MoviPrep ) will result in a lower CI bound greater than – 10%, with probability 80%. 
This result would establish the non -inferiority of BLI4700 to MoviPrep  at a non -
inferiority margin of 10%.  
 Our sample -size calculations for equivalence tests with a binary outcome use the 
method of Chow et al5. If the MoviPrep  success rate is 94% and the BLI4700 success 
rate is 90%, the sample size needed is n= 504 (total across both study groups) for a 
non-inferiority margin of 10% and a target power of 80%.  Thus with the study 
requirement of 540 subjects undergoing colonoscopy, we will attain 80% power .  
In randomized studies, the purpose of the stratification is to eliminate the 
stratification factor from th e error term, thereby [CONTACT_226063]6.  
Moreover, because the trial will use stratification in the design, for consistency we 
will employ a stratified test in the analysis.  The CMH analysis on risk differences, 
by [CONTACT_594311], essentially renders the analysis equivalent to that of a 
single -center study.  The sample -size calculation described above assumes a single 
stratum that is free of between -stratum variability and therefore effectively models 
the stratified analysis th at we will conduct.  
 
9.4. Study Populations  
The following populations have been defined for data analyses.  
9.4.1. Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
This population includes all subjects assigned  to treatment and will be used for 
sensitivity analysis of the primary e fficacy endpoint.  
9.4.2.  Modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT) Population  
This population consists of all enrolled  subjects that took any portion of the study 
preparation. This population will be utilized for primary and secondary efficacy 
analyses and all safety a nalyses.

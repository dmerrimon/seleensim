Title of Study:  A Phase 2, Single -Arm, Open -Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of 
Niraparib Combined with Bevacizumab as Maintenance Treatment in Patients with Advanced Ovarian 
Cancer, Fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_325174], or Primary Peritoneal  Cancer Following Front -Line Platinum -Based 
Chemotherapy with Bevacizumab  
Study center(s):  Approximately 35 sites  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_582359] (years):  
First patient enrolled:  [ADDRESS_765892] patient completed:  Q4 2022  Phase of development:  
Phase 2  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of niraparib in combination with bevacizumab, as assessed by 18 -
month progression -free survival (PFS) landmark analysis, in patients with Stage IIIB to IV 
ovarian cancer who have complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or no evidence of 
disease (NED) following front -line, platinum -based chemotherapy with bevacizumab  
Secondary:  
• To evaluate additional measures of clinical benefit, including PFS, RECIST or CA -125 
progression free survival, overall survival (OS), patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures, 
time to first subsequent therapy (TFST), and time to second subsequent therapy (TSST)  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of niraparib and bevacizumab combination in the 
indicated target population  
Exploratory  
• To evaluate PFS rate at 6 months (PFS6) and 12 months (PFS12)  
• Retrospective analysis to evaluate homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) per the 
Myriad myChoice® HRD test as a potential biomarker  for response to the niraparib and 
bevacizumab combination  
Methodology:  
Overall Study Design  
This is a multicenter, Phase 2, single -arm, open -label study to evaluate niraparib combined with 
bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in patients with advanced (S tage IIIB -IV) ovarian cancer, 
fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351], or primary peritoneal cancer with completely or incompletely resected disease 
who are recovered from primary debulking surgery.  
Approximately 90 patients will be enrolled.  
Eligible patients who achieve CR, PR, or NED following treatment with platinum -based chemotherapy 
in addition to bevacizumab will be enrolled in the study and receive maintenance treatment with 
niraparib (for up to 3 years) combined with bevacizumab (for u p to 10 months during the maintenance

 phase or up to a total of 15 months inclusive of the approximately 5 months of bevacizumab received 
with chemotherapy) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, Investigator’s 
decision, or d eath, whichever comes first (see Study Design Schema). Patients who continue to derive 
benefit from study treatment based on continuation of non-progression indicated by [CONTACT_9661], remain 
clinically stable, and are willing to continue study visits and assess ments may continue to receive 
niraparib beyond 3 years following consultation with the Investigator and the medical monitor.  
Study Design Schema  
 
Abbreviations:  CR = complete response; NED  = no evidence of disease; PR = partial response.  
*Patients ≥77 kg and with platelet count of ≥150,000/ µL will receive 300 mg/day; patients <77 kg and/ or with 
platelet count of <150,000 u/L will receive 200 mg/day  
 
Study Conduct  
Safety assessments conducted throughout the treatment period include treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment discontinuations or dose reductions due to 
adverse events (AEs), changes in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, 
changes in clinical laboratory results (hematology an d chemistry), vital sign measurements, 
observations during physical examination, and use of concomitant medications.  
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 tumor assessment via computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and clinically 
indicated areas is required at screening, then every 12 weeks (±7 days) f rom Cycle 1/Day [ADDRESS_765893] 48 weeks, then every 24 weeks (±14 days) until disease progression, at which point a final set of 
imaging scans is required. Only one set of imaging is required showing unequivocal disease 
progression while on study tr eatment and/or prior to beginning follow -up therapy. Positron emission 
tomography (PET)/CT may be used according to RECIST  v1.[ADDRESS_765894] v1.1 is used to define progressive dis ease (PD) in this study. Tumor assessment by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI 
must unequivocally show PD according to RECIST  v1.1 criteria. PD will not be diagnosed in case of 
CA-125 progression in the absence of radiologic evidence of progressive disease.

screening window before Cycle 1/Day 1 but prior to signing the main informed consent form (ICF), the 
patient is not required to complete an additional CT/MRI scan for study screening.  
PROs (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Ovarian Symptom Index [FOSI]) will be collected 
every 6 weeks (±7 days) for 6  months, then every 12 weeks (±7 days) thereafter while the patient is 
receiving study treatment. Once a patient discontinues treatm ent, PRO evaluations will be performed 
4 weeks (±7 days), 8 weeks (±7 days), 12 weeks (±7 days), and 24  weeks (±7 days) after treatment 
discontinuation, regardless of subsequent treatment.  
All patients will undergo an End of Treatment Visit within [ADDRESS_765896] -treatment follow -up visits will be conducted every 12  weeks (±14 days) 
after the last dose of study treatment.  
All AEs and SAEs, regardless of causality, will be collected and recorded for eac h patient from the day 
the ICF is signed until [ADDRESS_765897] returned to 
baseline or normalized, until there is a satisfactory explanation for the change(s) observed, until the 
patient is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent, or until the patient has di ed. 
The niraparib adverse events of special interest (AESIs) for this study are myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and secondary cancer (new malignancies other than 
MDS/AML). AESIs must be reported to the Sponsor as soon as  the Investigator becomes aware of 
them or within 24 hours.  
Number of patients (planned):  Approximately 90 patients will be enrolled into the study

On Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle  (84-day cycle after implementation of amendment 2) , bevacizumab 
15 mg/kg will be  administered via IV infusion.1 Bevacizumab will be administered for up to 10 months 
during the maintenance phase or up to a total of 15 months inclusive of the approximately 5 months of 
bevacizumab received with chemotherapy.  Niraparib will be administered orally once a day, 
continuously throughout each 21 -day cycle  (84-day cycle after implementation of amendment 2) , for 
up to 3  years in the absence of PD, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, Investigator’s decision, 
or death. On Day 1 of each cycle, niraparib will be administered upon completion of bevacizumab 
infusion.  
Patients who continue to derive benefit from study treatment based on continuation of  non-progression  
indicated by [CONTACT_9661], remain clinically stable, and are willing to continue study visits and assessments 
may continue to receive niraparib beyond 3 years following consultation with the Investig ator and the 
medical monitor.  
The starting dose of niraparib will be based on the patient’s baseline actual body weight or platelet 
count. Patients with a baseline actual body weight of ≥77 kg and screening platelet count of 
≥150,000/µL will take three cap sules of 100 mg strength (300 mg) at each dose administration. 
Patients with a baseline actual body weight of <77 kg and/or  screening platelet count of <150,000/µL 
will take two capsules of 100 mg strength (200 mg) at each dose administration. Additional d ose 
modifications will not be based upon changes in the patient’s actual body weight during study 
participation.   
Patients will be instructed to take their niraparib dose once a day or as instructed by [CONTACT_737].  
Patients must swallow and not chew  all capsules. The consumption of water and food is permissible.  
For patients whose starting dose is 2 capsules (200 mg/day), escalation to 3 capsules (300 mg/day) is 
permitted if no treatment interruptions or discontinuations were required during the firs t 2 cycles of 
therapy. This escalation will occur at the discretion of the Investigator, following discussion with the 
Medical Monitor.  
Dose interruption (no longer than 28 days) or dose reduction will be allowed based on treatment side 
effects. For patie nts whose initial dose is 3 capsules daily (300 mg/day), dose reductions to 2 capsules 
daily (200 mg/day) and subsequently to 1 capsule daily (100 mg/day) will be allowed. No further dose 
reduction will be allowed without discussion with the Medical Monito r.

death. Patients who have not progressed after [ADDRESS_765909] an option to continue to receive study treatment.  
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  Not applicable.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Primary endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS rate at 18 months (PFS18), which is defined as the proportion of 
patients who have not progressed or died within [ADDRESS_765910] v1.1 criteria per Investigator assessment . 
Secondary endpoints  
The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated:  
• PFS, defined as the time from niraparib combined with bevacizumab treatment initiation to the 
earlier date of assessment of progression, as assessed by [CONTACT_393]  v1.1 criteria, based on 
Investigator assessment, or death by [CONTACT_72999]  
• RECIST or CA -[ADDRESS_765911] 
v1.1 or CA -125 progression, or death by [CONTACT_55544].  
• OS as measured from the date of initiation of treatment of niraparib in combination with 
bevacizumab treatment to the date of death by [CONTACT_55544]  
• The observed change from baseline in the F OSI PRO assessment  
• TFST, defined as the date of initiation of niraparib treatment in combination with bevacizumab 
treatment in the current study to the start date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy  
• TSST, defined as the date of initiation of nirapar ib treatment in combination with bevacizumab in 
the current study to the start date of the second subsequent anticancer therapy  
• Safety and tolerability of the combination  
Exploratory endpoints  
The following exploratory endpoints will be evaluated:  
• PFS rate  at 6 months (PFS6) and 12 months (PFS12)  
• HRD status as a potential biomarker for response to niraparib -bevacizumab treatment  
Statistical methods:  
Sample size considerations  
The sample size of the study is driven by [CONTACT_53229]: PFS18. A sample s ize of 90 patients 
will provide an 11% precision on the 95% exact confidence interval (CI) of PFS18, assuming a true 
PFS18 rate of 48%, which corresponds to a median PFS of 17 months based on exponential PFS

 assumption. The primary endpoint analysis will o ccur after approximately 3 months of enrollment and 
an additional 18 months of follow -up. 
 
Analysis populations  
Three analysis populations will be defined as follows:  
• Safety population:  All patients who receive any amount of study treatment (ie, any amount of 
bevacizumab or niraparib during the study). All safety endpoints will be assessed in the safety 
population.  
• Efficacy population:  All patients who receive any amount of niraparib (at least 1  dose). Analyses 
of baseline characteristics and the pri mary analysis of efficacy endpoints will be performed on the 
efficacy population.  
• Per-protocol population:  All patients in the efficacy population who have no major protocol 
violations during the study and have at least 1 protocol -required postbaseline tu mor assessment.  
 
General methods  
The primary endpoint for the study, PFS18, will be estimated using percentage with 95% exact CI. In 
addition, the probability of PFS at [ADDRESS_765912] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous 
variables. Time -to-event analyses will be performed using the Kaplan -Meier method. Tw o-sided 
95% CIs will be provided where appropriate. No formal statistical testing will be performed. Further 
details will be provided in the study statistical analysis plan (SAP).

 3. INTRODUCTION  
Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and dependency on neo -angiogenesis are 2  major 
vulnerabilities of human cancers that ha ve been successfully exploited therapeutically, as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_582374](ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors including 
niraparib (Zejula®) for ovarian cancer and angiogenesis inhibitors including bevacizumab 
(Avastin®; Genentech/[COMPANY_002] [LOCATION_002] [US]) for several indications including ovarian 
cancer. Emerging pre -clinical and clinical data suggest that combination of these 2  classes of 
agents may increase therapeutic options for women with ovarian cancer.  
3.1. Background of PARP and PARP Inhibition  
PARP1 and PARP2 are key enzymes for repairing single -strand deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) 
breaks. When they are inhibited, single -strand DNA breaks become double -strand DNA breaks 
after DNA replication, forcing cancer cells to rely on double -stran d break repair mechanisms, in 
particular homologous recombination, for survival and proliferation.  
PARP inhibitors selectively kill a subset of cancer cells with deficiencies in DNA repair 
pathways. For example, a tumor arising in a patient with a germline  breast cancer susceptibility 
gene mutation (g BRCA mut) has a defective homologous recombination DNA repair pathway and 
would be increasingly dependent on base excision repair (BER), a pathway blocked by [CONTACT_582375], for maintenance of genomic integrity . In addition to breast cancer susceptibility gene 
(BRCA ) mutations, DNA -repair defects can be caused by [CONTACT_582376]. In a recent analysis of 
~500 high -grade serous ovarian cancer tumors, approximately 50% contained homologous 
recombination defects,  which could sensitize tumors to PARP inhibitors.2 This concept of 
inducing tumor cell death in tumors with inherent defects in DNA repair using PARP inhibitors 
is called synthetic lethality.3 
3.2. Background of Niraparib  
Niraparib  ([COMPANY_004]3985771)  is a PARP inhibitor indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal cancer who 
exhibit a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to platinum -based chemotherapy.  
Niraparib is an oral inhibitor of PARP -[ADDRESS_765929] shown that niraparib -induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP 
enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP -DNA complexes, resulting in  DNA 
damage, apoptosis, and cell death. Increased niraparib -induced cytotoxicity was observed in 
tumor cell lines with or without deficiencies in BRCA 1/2. Niraparib decreased tumor growth in 
mouse xenograft models of human cancer cell lines with deficienci es in BRCA 1/2 and in human 
patient -derived xenograft tumor models with homologous recombination deficiency that had 
either mutated or wild type BRCA 1/2. 
Niraparib has been evaluated in a series of Phase [ADDRESS_765930] 2  previous chemotherapy regimens and received niraparib or placebo 
maintenance (“ENGOT -OV16/NOVA” study).

 The ENGOT -OV16/NOV A study4 is a double-blind, 2:1 (niraparib:placebo) randomi zed, 
placebo-controlled stu dy of maintenance treatment with ni raparib compared with pl acebo in 
patients with pl atinum - sensitive  ovarian cancer who have received at least [ADDRESS_765931] no m easurable disease >2 cm and 
normal cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) (or >90% decrease) following their last treatment. There 
were  [ADDRESS_765932] a tumor  with hi gh-grade serous histolo gy but without g BRCA mut (non-
gBRCA mut). Patients in the non - gBRCA mut cohort are further characterized by [CONTACT_582377] (positive or negative).  
A total of [ADDRESS_765933] 
negative (HRDneg). HRD status was not determined (HRDnd) for 54 patients.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics were well -balanced.  
Table  2 shows the results for the PFS primary endpoint for each of the 3 primary efficacy 
populations (ie, g BRCA mut cohort, HRDpos cohort, and overall non -gBRCA mut cohort). In 
addition, median PFS in patients with HRD  negative (HRDneg) tumors was 6.9 months (95% CI: 
5.6, 9.6) in the niraparib arm compared to 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.7, 5.6) in the placebo arm with 
an HR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.361, 0.922) (p=0.0226).

Progression -free survival is defined as the time in months from the date of randomization to progression or death.  
The primary data to support the safety of treatment with niraparib in this proposed indication are 
derived from the ENGOT -OV16/NOVA main stu dy in which a total of 546 patients received 
study treatment. Safety presentations for the NOVA study are derived from the analyses included 
in the clinical study report and include comparisons of the safety profile of niraparib 
maintenance treatment versu s placebo in women with platinum -sensitive recurrent ovarian 
cancer.

 cancer. Review of the data across study cohorts for TEAE incidence showed that, in general, the 
results were similar in the g BRCA mut and non -gBRCA mut cohorts. In the ov erall safety 
population, for the niraparib versus placebo treatment arms, the incidences of Grade 3/4 TEAEs 
(74% vs 23%), serious adverse events (SAEs) (30% vs 15%), TEAEs leading to treatment 
interruption (69% vs 5%), TEAEs leading to dose reduction (67% vs 15%), and TEAEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation (15% vs 2%) were higher for niraparib. There were no on -treatment 
deaths reported. The incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) in patients who received niraparib (5 of  367; 1.4%) was similar to the incidence in 
patients who received placebo (2 of 179; 1.1%). MDS/AML and secondary cancers (new 
malignancies other than MDS or AML) are potential risks of PARP inhibitors.  
The selection of the 300 mg starting dose of nirapar ib for the phase 3 r andomized double -blind 
trial of maintenance with niraparib versus placebo in the ENGOT -OV16/ NOVA study was based 
on data from the Phase 1 MAD study PN001 conducted by [CONTACT_44873] & Co. There were no formal 
Phase [ADDRESS_765936] ed. The Phase 1 study included both a dose escalation 
phase to determine the maximal tolerated dose and an expansion arm to further evaluate the 
selected dose. A total of 104 patients with advanced solid tumors were evaluated in this study, 
including 60 du ring dose escalation from 30 mg to 400 mg and 54 during expansion at the 300 
mg dose level. The dose escalation stage determined that 400 mg exceeded the maximal tolerated 
dose (by [CONTACT_73543] -limiting toxicity evaluations and by [CONTACT_582378]). No dose -limiting toxicities were observed at 290 or 300 mg dose levels. In the Phase 
3 study, daily niraparib improved progression -free survival (PFS) in a cohort of patients with 
gBRCA  mutation as well as in a cohort of patient s without g BRCA  mutation. Within the 
gBRCA mut cohort, the median PFS was 21.0  months in patients on niraparib versus 5.5 months 
on placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; p  < 0.0001). In recurrent ovarian cancer patients, efficacy 
was assessed in patients with H RD-positive tumors as identified by [CONTACT_73545]’s myChoice 
HRD test as well in the overall non -gBRCA  mutation cohort regardless of HRD status. As 
observed in the g BRCA mut cohort, PFS was significantly longer with niraparib in the 
homologous recombination de ficient -positive group of the non -gBRCA mut (without germline 
BRCA  mutation) cohort (median, 12.9 months vs 3.8  months; HR, 0.38; p < 0.0001). Lastly, PFS 
was significantly improved in the overall non -gBRCA mut cohort (median, 9.3 months vs 
3.9 months; HR, 0 .45; p  < 0.0001). Secondary endpoints, including chemotherapy -free interval, 
time to first subsequent therapy (TFST), and progression -free survival 2 (PFS2), confirmed the 
PFS benefit of niraparib treatment in both cohorts. This provides compelling evidenc e that 
niraparib does not diminish responsiveness to subsequent therapy and that the niraparib treatment 
effect persists. Subsequently in 2017, a recommendation to consider niraparib maintenance 
therapy in this setting in cases of CR and PR was added to th e National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network ( NCCN) guidelines.[ADDRESS_765937] commonly observed non -hematologic treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs ) of 
any National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -
CTCAE) grade were nausea, fatigue, constipation, and vomiting; the majority of the non -
hematologic TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly observed 
hematologic TEAEs (any grade) were anemia (48.5%), thrombocytopenia 66.2%), and 
neutropenia (31.4%).

 TEAEs leading to treatment interruption, reduction or discontinuation were 68.9%, 66.5% and 
14.7% respectively. Approximately 50% of patients required dos e interruption during the first 
month of niraparib therapy, and 47% required dose reduction during the second month of 
therapy. Most patients achieved their individual maximal tolerated dose by [CONTACT_73546]. The 
average dose of niraparib during the stud y was 206 mg. After Month 3 or 4, new incidents of 
thrombocytopenia were reported in <  1% of patients. Although Grade  3 or 4 hematologic 
laboratory events were common at the initiation of treatment, no severe clinical sequelae were 
observed, and relatively  few patients discontinued due to these AEs (discontinuation rate was 
3.3% for thrombocytopenia, 1.4% for anemia and 1.9% for neutropenia). Dose adjustment based 
on individual tolerability during the first [ADDRESS_765938] decreased ef ficacy relative to those who 
remain at the 300  mg starting dose.  
These data support that each patient has an optimal benefit/risk at their individualized dose. As 
lower doses are associated with substantial improvements in the incidence of TEAEs while not  
appearing to compromise efficacy, approaches to quickly transition patients to their 
individualized optimal dose, particularly patients at the highest risk of grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia in cycle 1were further evaluated. In addition, an exploratory anal ysis was 
conducted to determine if risk factors could be identified for a subgroup of patients which were 
associated with higher rates of hematologic toxicity.  In the updated analysis, two factors were 
identified as being associated with thrombocytopenia,  baseline platelet count and baseline body 
weight.  
Baseline Platelet Count and Weight as Predictors of Thrombocytopenia.  
An analysis was conducted using the data collected in ENGOT -OV16/ NOVA and the initial 
phase [ADDRESS_765939] on 
platelet nadir; lower baseline platelets (<180,000/µL) were associated with an increased 
frequency of thrombocytopenia Grade ≥1 (76%) or Grade ≥ 3 (45%) compared to patients with 
higher baseline platelet counts. Further, a n exploratory analysis of clinical data versus baseline 
body weight from ENGOT -OV16/ NOVA was conducted. For this analysis, the weight categories 
were based on quartiles with the lowest quartile (patients with a body weight less than 58 kg at 
baseline) compared to the highest quartile (patients with a body weight greater than or equal to

TEAEs, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to dose modification or treatment dis continuation occurred 
more commonly in the weight <58 kg cohort than in the ≥77 kg cohort. In the cohort of patients 
with a body weight <58 kg, approximately 80% of patients had a dose reduction compared to 
59% of patients with a weight greater than or equ al to 77 kg. Treatment discontinuations were 
increased in the subjects with lower body weight (24%) compared to patients in the highest 
quartile (10%).      
The potential relationship between body weight and TEAEs was further explored in an analysis

Finally, a classification tr ee approach was used to refine the best cut -off points for predicting the 
likelihood of a patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ≥Grade [ADDRESS_765942] dose 
of niraparib. The results of the model show that t he subgroup of patients with a base line body 
weight <77 kg or baseline platelet count <150,000/µL had a grade 3/[ADDRESS_765943] 30 days of 35.4% compared to 11.5% in the group of patients with a body weight >77 kg 
and a platelet count >150,000/µL. Further, the average d aily dose was [ADDRESS_765944] 
two cycles for patients with a body weight >77 kg and platelet count >150,000/µL, and was only 
206 mg for patients with body weight < 77 kg or platelet count <150,000/µL. Thus, the actual 
delivered dose approximated a  starting dose of 200 mg despi[INVESTIGATOR_14479] a starting 
dose of 300 mg. These observations are to be confirmed in the present study with the inclusion of 
study treatment dosed at 200 mg (2 capsules of niraparib or placebo) in patients whose ba seline 
weight is <77 kg or baseline platelet count is <150,000/µL.  
Guidance on monitoring patients for new events of MDS and AML and the follow -up of patients 
with suspected MDS or AML is provided in Section  10.3.7 . Additional niraparib clinical safety 
data reported to date, including Phase 1 and NOVA results, dose  limiting - toxicities, and toxicity 
profile, are provided in detail in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
3.3. Background of Bevacizumab  
Bevacizumab is an antiangiogenic recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 
antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein. Bevacizumab (Avastin; 
Genentech/[COMPANY_002] US) has been approved in the US and European Union (EU) for the treatment 
of multiple tumor types in combination with certain other treatments. In the US and EU, 
bevacizumab is approved for the front -line treatment of adult patients with advanced 
(International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] Stages IIIB, IIIC, and IV) 
ovarian cancer. In the US, bevacizumab is approved for the treatment of patients with platinum -
sensitive recurrent ovarian  cancer, either in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel or in 
combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine, followed by [CONTACT_582379] a single agent.  
Bevacizumab has been evaluated in multiple clinical studies, including in 1,873 patients with 
newly diagnosed, Stage  III (incompletely resected) or Stage IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_582361] a Phase 3 study (GOG218).6 Patie nts receiving 
bevacizumab administered concurrently with chemotherapy and as a maintenance treatment 
showed statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to placebo (14.1 months vs 
10.3 months; HR, 0.717; p < 0.001).  
Bevacizumab was also evaluated  in 1,528 patients with ovarian cancer, regardless of FIGO stage 
as part of a Phase 3 study (ICON7).7 Patients receiving bevacizumab administered concurrently 
with chemotherapy and as a maintenance treatment showed stat istically significant improvement 
in PFS compared to chemotherapy alone (19.0 months vs 17.3 months; HR, 0.81; p = 0.004), 
with maximum improvement compared to chemotherapy alone at 12 months (15.1%;

 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.7 -19.5). The improvemen t was even more pronounced in 
patients at high risk of progression (ie, FIGO Stage IV or FIGO Stage III and >1.0  cm of residual 
disease after debulking surgery; 15.9 months vs 10.5 months; HR, 0.68; p = <0.001).  
3.4. Disease Background and Current Treatment Opt ions 
Appro ximate ly 75% of ovarian cancer patients respond to front -line, platinum -based thera py and 
are considered platinum sensitiv e, standard ly defined as a minimum duration of 6 months with 
no relapse or  progression following  treatment. Up to 70% of these patients, however,  relapse  
within [ADDRESS_765945] produced conflicting results. A meta -analysis of 8  randomized studies 
in which maintenance chemotherapy was compared with no further intervention, maintenance 
radiotherapy, or another type of maintenance treatment demonstrated no significant difference  in 
PFS or 3 -, 5-, or 10 -year overall survival (OS).10 Another meta -analysis of 20 consolidation and 
9 maintenance treatment studies, however, demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS 
(HR,  0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 -0.96; p  < 0.02).11 Recent clinical trials of anti -angiogenic agents 
(such  as bevacizumab and pazopanib) administered in a maintenance setting have demonstrated a 
benefit in PFS6,12,13 but resulted in an increase in toxicity.  
At the time of study initiation,  given the expectation of disease recurrence for patients who 
demonstrate a CR to front -line, platinum therapy, the NCCN guidelines recommend observatio n, 
clinical trial participation, or maintenance therapy with paclitaxel (Level 3 recommendation) or 
pazopanib (Level 2B recommendation); observation is the most common approach.[ADDRESS_765946] supportive care. Recommendations from the European Society for 
Medical Oncology (ESMO) include bevacizumab in front -line therapy followed by [CONTACT_582380] a total duration of up to 15  months.1,14 
A Phase 3 clinical study of niraparib maintenance treatment in patients with advanced ovarian 
cancer followin g response to front -line, platinum -based therapy, excluding patients who receive 
bevacizumab in combination with their front -line chemotherapy, is ongoing (PRIMA). In the 
current study, maintenance with niraparib combined with bevacizumab following front -line, 
platinum -based therapy with bevacizumab will be explored.1,[ADDRESS_765947] genes, a functional

and reoxygenation can induce both single -strand and double -strand DNA breaks within tumor 
cells due to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. These [ADDRESS_765949]  and PARP inhibition. In the clinical setting, preliminary 
evidence of clinical efficacy  has been observed in patients with platinum -sensitive  ovarian 
cancer treated with either niraparib combined with be vacizumab (ENGOT -OV24/AVANOVA 
trial) or olaparib combined with cediranib (Phase II), irrespective of their BRCA  mutation or 
HRD status. These data provide a strong rationale for combining a PARP inhibitor with an 
angiogenesis inhibitor.  
To validate the hyp othesis that tumors without HRD can be effectively treated with the 
combination of niraparib and bevacizumab, the HRD status for pretreatment tumor tissue will be 
determined using the Myriad myChoice® HRD test.  
The combination of niraparib and bevacizumab treatment is currently being explored in patients 
with recurrent platinum -sensitive ovarian cancer as part of an ongoing Phase 1/2 study 
(AVANOVA).15 Phase 1 of the study (dose escalation) has determined the recommended Phase 2 
dose in this population to be 300 mg niraparib orally once daily and 15  mg/kg bevacizumab via 
intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks. Results to date, although limited, indicate clinical 
activity of the combination in this patient population.  
Overall, the combination of niraparib and bevacizumab appears to be safe for administration, 
with a manageable safety profile. AEs observed to date are consistent with those of the 
individual components and are readily managed through routine laboratory testing (ie, CBC), 
clinical  surveillance (ie, blood pressure monitoring), and adherence to the recommended dose 
modifications.  
3.6. Rationale for Current Trial  
Niraparib is approved in the US for the maintenance treatment of women with recurrent ovarian 
cancer who have a CR or PR to plat inum -based chemotherapy following at least 2 previous 
chemotherapy regimens. In addition, a Phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of niraparib maintenance treatment in patients with advanced ovarian cancer following response 
to front -line, platinum -based therapy, excluding patients who receive bevacizumab in 
combination with their front -line chemotherapy, is ongoing (“PRIMA” study).  
Recent data suggest that the combination of a PARP inhibitor, like niraparib, with a VEGF 
inhibitor, like  bevacizumab, in maintenance treatment has the potential for improved PFS 
benefits after front -line chemotherapy in platinum -responsive (CR or PR) ovarian cancer 
patients. This hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_582382], nonclini cal 
studies, and an ongoing Phase 1/2 study in this patient population. To date, the combination has 
proven to be safe for administration for extended periods in patients with advanced ovarian 
cancer .15

indicated target population  
4.3. Exploratory Objectives  
Exploratory ob jectives include the following:  
1. To evaluate PFS rate at 6 months (PFS6) and 12 months (PFS12)  
2. Retrospective analysis to evaluate HRD per the Myriad myChoice® HRD test as a 
potential biomarker for response to the niraparib and bevacizumab combination

 5. INVES TIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a multicenter, Phase 2, single -arm, open -label study to evaluate niraparib combined with 
bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in patients with advanced (Stage IIIB -IV) ovarian cancer 
with completely or incompletely resected disease who are recovered from primary debulking 
surgery.  
Approximately 90 eligible patients who achieve CR, PR, or NED following treatment with 
platinum -based chemotherapy in addition to bevacizumab will receive maintenance treatment 
with niraparib (for up to 3 years) combined with bevacizumab (administered for up to 10 months 
during the maintenance phase or up to a total of 15 months  inclusive of  approximately 5 months 
of bevacizumab received with chemotherapy) or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
patient withdrawal, Investigator’s decision, or d eath, whichever comes first (see Figure  1). 
Patients who continue to derive benefit from study treatment based on continuation of  non-
progression  indic ated by [CONTACT_9661], remain clinically stable, and are willing to continue study 
visits and assessments may continue to receive niraparib beyond [ADDRESS_765951], the site will 
determine survival status for each patient  by [CONTACT_582383] , unless the 
patient  has withdrawn consent for surviva l FU. 
Study assessments and their timing are outlined in Figure  1.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Further Research Maintaining Confidential Patient  Information  
The Sponsor may conduct further research on specimens collected during this study. This 
research may include genetic/genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptional analyses. 
The data generated may be combined with clinical and histologic al image analysis. Such 
research helps to address emergent questions not described in the protocol and will only be 
conducted on specimens from properly consented patient s. 
In an effort to optimize the research that can be conducted with further research specimens, it is 
essential to link study patient  clinical study data with further research test results. The clinical 
study data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Know ing patient  characteristics like gender, 
age, medical history, treatment type, and treatment outcomes are critical to understanding the 
clinical context of further research analytical results.  
To maintain privacy of information collected from specimens obt ained for further research, the 
Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All specimens will be single coded per

Human Use (ICH) E15 guidelines, “Definiti ons for Genomic Biomarkers, Pharmacogenomics, 
Pharmacogenetics, Genomic Data and Sample Coding Categories18”. 
At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the further research specimens for 
transfer to the storage facility. This first code is  a random number that does not contain any 
personally identifying information embedded within it in order to maintain patient  privacy. The 
link (or key) between patient  identifiers and this first unique code will be held at the study site. 
No personal iden tifiers will appear on the specimen tube.  
Documentation of patient  life-time consent for further research will be captured in the eCRFs. 
Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified will be destroyed, as will 
those requested to be de stroyed at time of consent withdrawal.  
Patient s may withdraw their consent for further research and have their specimens and all 
derivatives destroyed. Patient s may withdraw consent at any time by [CONTACT_582386].  
6.4. Lost to Follow Up  
A patient  will be considered lost to follow -up if she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits 
and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298].  
The following actions must be taken if a patient  fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_135687], counsel the patient  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and 
ascertain whether the patient  wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Befor e a patient  is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970]  (where possible,  telephone calls and, if necessary, a 
certified letter to the patient ’s last known mailing address or local equi valent methods). 
These contact [CONTACT_23526] ’s medical record.  
• Should the patient  continue to be unreachable, she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study.  
• Site personnel, or an independent third party, will attem pt to collect the vital status of the 
patient  within legal and ethical boundaries for all patient s. Public sources may be searched 
for vital status information. If vital status is determined as deceased, this will be documented,  
and the patient  will not be considered lost to follow -up. Sponsor personnel will not be 
involved in any attempts to collect vital status information.

7.2. Concomitant Medications  
Any medication the patient takes other than the study treatment, including herbal and other 
non-traditional remedies, is considered a concomitant medication. All concomitant medications 
must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). The following information must be 
recorded in the eCRF for each concomitant  medication:  generic name, route of administration, 
start date, stop date, dosage, and indication. Any changes in the dosage or regimen of a 
concomitant medication must be recorded in the eCRF.  
At screening, patients will be asked what medications they have taken during the last 30  days. At 
each subsequent study visit, patients will be asked what concomitant medications they are 
currently taking.  
Niraparib has pot ential to weakly indu ce cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2. Th erefore, patients 
should be  advised to use  caution with drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2 with narrow 
therapeutic range.  The substrates of CYP1A2 with narrow therapeutic range include theophylline 
and tizanidine. T he niraparib safety profile includes risk for thrombo cytopenia, and bevacizumab 
may increase the potential for bleeding. T herefore, patients should be  advised to use  caution with

  The starting dose of niraparib will be based on the patient’s baseline actual body weight or 
platelet count. Patients with  a baseline actual body weight of ≥77 kg and baseline platelet count 
of ≥150,000 /µL will take three capsules of 100  mg strength (300 mg/day) at each dose 
administration. P atients with a baseline actual body weight of <77 kg and/ or baseline platelet 
count o f <150,000/µL will take two capsules of 100 mg strength (200 mg) at each dose 
administration. Additional dose modifications will not be based upon changes in the patient’s 
actual body weight during study participation.  
For patients whose starting dose is 2 capsules (200 mg/day), escalation to 3 capsules (300 
mg/day) is permitted if no treatment interruptions or discontinuations were required during the 
first 2 cycles of therapy. This escalation will occur at the discretion of the Investigator, following 
discussion with the Medical Monitor.

9.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS rate at 18 months (PFS18), which is defined as the 
proportion of patients who have not  progressed or died within [ADDRESS_765976]  v1.1 
criteria per Investigator assessment. PFS18 will be estimated using percentage with 95% exact 
CI. In addition, the probability of PFS at [ADDRESS_765977] v1.1 criteria ( Appendix  2). Positron emission 
tomography (PET)/CT may be used according to RECIST  v1.[ADDRESS_765978]/magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) must unequivocally show PD according to RECIST v1.1 criteria ( Appendix  2). If 
a patient had a CT/MRI of the abdomen/pelvis and clinically indicated areas within the 28 -day 
screening window before Cycle 1/Day 1 but prior to signing the main informed consent form 
(ICF), the patient is not required to complete  an additional CT/MRI scan for study screening.  
The Investigator will describe how PD criteria is met. When required to determine CA -125 
progression, CA -125 levels should be evaluated ± [ADDRESS_765979] be confirmed by a se cond determination ≥  7 days later. In case  assessments of CA -125 
levels that occur > 2 weeks from the primary PD assessments, the date of the primary assessment 
of PD will be used to define the date of PD.  
GCIG criteria for CA-125 progression are as follo ws:  
Patients with elevated CA -[ADDRESS_765980] show evidence 
of CA -125 ≥  2 × ULN on [ADDRESS_765981] show evidence of

10.1.3.  Weight and Height  
Weight and heig ht will be measured in accordance with the schedule of events ( Table  6). Height 
will be measured at screening only.  
10.1.4.  Physical Examination  
Physical examin ations will be performed in accordance with the schedule of events ( Table  6). 
Any physical examination or vital signs assessed as clinically significan t should be recorded as 
an AE or SAE. If SAE criteria are met, the finding should be recorded and reported according to 
the SAE reporting process (see Section  10.3.5 ). 
10.1.5.  Laboratory Assessments  
The following laboratory variables will be determined in accordance with the schedule of events 
(Table  6). These tests will be performed by [CONTACT_73554].  
Any laboratory values assessed as clinically significant should be recorded as an AE. If SAE 
criteria are met or if the laboratory abnormality is an adverse event of special interest (AESI; see 
Section  10.3.7 ), the event should be recorded and reported according  to the SAE reporting 
process (see Section  10.3.5 ). 
Hematologic testing may occur more frequently than is specified in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , if 
additional testing is medically indicated per Investigator judgment or if the event meets the 
criteria for niraparib dose modification (see Section  5.4.1 ). Additional tests may be performed at 
a laboratory facility other than the study site, but the test results must be reported to the study 
site, the study site must keep a copy of test results with the patient’s study file, and the results 
must be entered into the eCRF.  
Any suspected case of MDS/AML or secondary cancer (new malignancy other than MDS/AML) 
reported while a patient is receiving treatment or followed for post -treatment assessments must 
be referred to a local hematologist to perform bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752]. Testing 
completed as part of standard of care is sufficient as long as the methods are acceptable to the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monit or. The study site must receive a copy of the hematologist's report of 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy findings, which must include a classification according to WHO20, and other 
sample testing reports related to MDS/AML. Report data will be entered in the appropriate eCRF 
pages, and the site must keep a copy of all reports with the patient’s study file.

individual countr y as well as the recently issued guidance by [CONTACT_56517], the 
autonomy of each investigative site to assess the benefit/risk for their patients participating in the 
niraparib clinical studies should be maintained.  Due to the significant  challenges that currently 
face the healthcare system and patients due to COVID -19 as well as the potential for enduring or 
additional quarantine measures alternative means of performing study assessments may be 
implemented by [CONTACT_582390] a nd approval from the Sponsor.  
These alternative means of performing study assessments may extend beyond COVID -19 to 
patients who are unable to attend clinic visits after consultation with the Sponsor.  
It is expected that sites participating in niraparib cl inical studies will make every effort to ensure 
proper monitoring and wellbeing of enrolled patient s by [CONTACT_582391] .  
General rules for patient  with limited possibility to travel:  
• If possibl e, replace in person visits with telephone contact, or alternative location for 
assessment such as local labs and imaging centers   
• Local lab facilities  and/or radiology centers should be added to regulatory documents as 
required.  
• In instances where it is  desired to reduce patient  exposure in clinic, in person visits every 
other cycle are acceptable if no ongoing AEs or new AEs. These missed visits will be 
considered protocol deviations.  
• Delay in oral niraparib treatment for up to 28 days is acceptable if the patient s don’t have 
access to local labs and whereby [CONTACT_779]’s pharmacy would not dispense the study drug 
unless patient  is cleared with lab tests by [INVESTIGATOR_678] [INVESTIGATOR_582365] (SOP). − If longer than [ADDRESS_765992] the 
medical monitor around Day 28 of interruption. This will be reviewed,  and recommendations 
will be made on a case -by-case basis.  
• Drug dispensation for  niraparib is possible for multiple cycles, with multiple bottles 
dispensed at once to patient s who have not experienced an SAE related to the study treatment  
within the last 3 months (no ongoing “related” SAE) . 
 
Additionally, regulatory guidance issued in  response to the COVID -[ADDRESS_765993] monitoring and/or patient  access to the site and

  10.3. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
10.3.1.  Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily hav e to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including clinically significant laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the product.  
AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre -existing medical 
conditions. An AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time after the 
signing of the informed c onsent, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study 
treatment has been administered. (See Section  10.3.3  for information about AE collec ting and 
reporting.)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence, that, at any dose:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening (i.e., an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event that hypo thetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] * or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect;  
• Is an  important medical even t**  
*Exception: Preplanned (at time of informed consent) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14485], for 
protocol compliance or social reasons, or for observation will not be considered criteria for an 
SAE. The reason for the planned h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_582366]. Complications experienced during these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14487] (or 
SAEs, if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14488]).  
**Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in determining whether situations or 
events should be considered serious adverse events: an important medical event may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_582367] i ntervention to prevent one of the above outcomes. Examples of such events 
are allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that may require intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home but do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse, and transmission of disease associated with the administration of the 
study drug. (See Section  10.3.5  for information  about SAE reporting.)

  [IP_ADDRESS].  Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)  
Any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any event already 
present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adve rse Events of Special Interest (AESI)  
Any AE (serious or non -serious) that is of scientific and medical concern specific to the study 
treatment, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_14538].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Special  Situations: Abuse, Misuse, Medication Errors, Overdose, and Accidental 
or Occupational Exposure  
• Abuse:  the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study treatment which is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_3584].  
• Misuse:  medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with 
the authorized/approved product information.  
• Medication error:  any preventable incident that may cause or lead to inappropriate study 
treatment use or patient harm while th e study treatment is in the control of the health care 
professionals or patients. Such incident may be due to health care professional practice, 
product labeling, packaging and preparation, procedures for administration, and systems, 
including the followin g: prescribing, order communication, nomenclature, compounding, 
dispensing, distribution, administration, education, monitoring, and use.  
• Overdose:  a deliberate or accidental administration of study treatment to a study patient, at a 
dose greater than that  which was assigned to that patient per the study protocol and under the 
direction of the Investigator.  If an overdose occurs, the Investigator and the Sponsor should 
be notified immediately, and the patient should be observed closely for AEs. Associated AEs 
should be treated and monitored by [CONTACT_737]. The dosage of study drug administered, 
any associated AEs, and/or treatment provided to the patient because of the overdose, should 
be documented on the applicable sections within the eCRF.  
• Accidenta l /Occupational exposure:  the unintentional exposure to a study treatment as a 
result of one's professional or non -professional occupation, or accidental exposure to a non -
professional to whom exposure was not intended (i.e., study product given to wrong p atient).  
10.3.2.  Assessment of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Severity Assessment  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_153280]* according to Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03: 14 June 2010; National Institutes of Health (NIH), 
National C ancer Institute (NCI). The CTCAE severity grades 1 through 5 provide unique clinical 
descriptions of severity of each adverse event. The CTCAE v4.03 is available on the NCI/NIH 
website.

  Please note that there is a distinction between serious and severe AEs : Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540]  [IP_ADDRESS] . For example, a mild 
degree of gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14490].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Relationship to Study Intervention  
The Investigator must provide a causality assessment regarding the relations hip of the event with 
the study drug and/or study procedure for all AEs.  One of the following categories should be 
selected based on medical judgment, considering all contributing factors:  
• Related : A causal relationship between the medicinal product (and/ or study procedures) and 
AE is a reasonable possibility. For example, the occurrence of the AE cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_14541]. The AE, however, can be explained by [CONTACT_582392] a similar event havi ng been reported previously, alteration of the 
dose effect, or the timing or seriousness of the AE, etc. Positive rechallenge/dechallenge is 
supportive.  
• Not Related : A causal relationship between the medicinal product (and/or study procedures) 
and AE is n ot a reasonable possibility: there is no temporal relationship between the 
medicinal product and event, or an alternative etiology is more reasonable.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Expectedness  
The Sponsor will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event is ‘expected’ or 
‘unexpected’. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information provided in the Reference Safety Information of 
the effective niraparib Investigator Brochure (IB).  
10.3.3.  Collection an d Recording Adverse Events  
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_4694], or discovered by [CONTACT_14543], nonleading question such as, “How have you 
been feeling since your last study visit?” The Investigator will document the nature of AE, date 
of onset of the AE (and time, if known), date of outcome of the AE (and time, if known), 
severity of the AE, action taken with study drug as a result of the AE, assessment of the 
seriousness of the AE, and assessment of the causal relationship of the AE to study drug and/or 
study procedure.  
AEs, including laboratory abnormalities that are assessed as clinically significant or require 
intervention, should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual 
underlying signs and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or 
symptom should be recorded as a separate AE.  
All SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF for this study up to 90 days (±14 days) 
after the last dose of study treatment and recorded in the eCRF. SAEs will also be reported on an 
SAE form as described in Section  10.3.5  of this protoco l. SAEs considered by [CONTACT_582393].

  All AEs, regardless of the source of identification (e.g., physical examination, laboratory 
assessment, ECG, or reported by [CONTACT_4676]), will be collec ted and recorded in the eCRF for each 
patient from the signing of the ICF for this study up to 90 days (±14 days) after the last dose of 
study treatment.  
Concomitant illnesses that existed before entry into the study will not be considered AEs unless 
the illness worsens during the Treatment Period. Pre -existing conditions will be recorded as 
Medical History in the eCRF and on the SAE Report Form.  
Disease progression is an efficacy criterion and is therefore not considered an AE or SAE (even 
if fatal). Disea se progression should be reported within the eCRF. If AEs/SAEs occur in relation 
to disease progression that are not consistent with the natural progression of the patient’s disease, 
these AEs/SAEs must be reported per AE/SAE reporting requirements describ ed in 
Section  10.3.[ADDRESS_765994] sign an d date all SAE Report 
Forms.   
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to review source documentation and describe pertinent 
information on the SAE Report Form. If supporting documentation is requested (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14491], consultant reports, deat h certificates, autopsy reports, etc.), the Investigator should 
highlight all relevant and pertinent information within such documents, ensure that any patient's 
personal identifiers (including Medical Record number) are removed, and submit the documents 
with the SAE Form to the Sponsor. The Sponsor (or designee) will return a confirmation of 
receipt for all email reports (if received from other than a "no reply" domain) within 1 business 
day.  
After receipt of the initial report, the Sponsor (or designee) will review the information and, if 
necessary, contact [CONTACT_14546]. The Investigator must promptly 
respond to queries from the Sponsor.

  10.3.6.  Submission and Distribution of Serious Adverse Event Reports  
Per regulatory requireme nts, if an event is assessed by [CONTACT_14547] a Serious Unexpected 
Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R), it is the responsibility of the Sponsor to submit the S[LOCATION_003]R 
Regulatory Authorities according to applicable regulations.  
In addition, the S[LOCATION_003]R will be distributed  to the Investigators/sites, utilizing a Council for 
International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) report form, or the MedWatch 3500A 
form). The Investigator/site will submit a copy of the report to their respective Institutional 
Review Board (IR B) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) per the governing institutional 
requirements and in compliance with local laws and guidelines.  
10.3.7.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) for niraparib are the following:  
• Myelodysp lastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)  
• Secondary cancers (new  malignancies [other than MDS or AML])  
AESI should be collected and reported as follows:  
• MDS and AML along with other secondary cancers should be reported to the Sponsor until 
death or loss to follow -up. 
10.3.8.  Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia  
MDS and AML, including cases with fatal outcome, have been reported with the use of 
niraparib. In clinical trials, the duration of niraparib treatment in patients prior to developin g 
MDS/AML varied from 1 month to >4 years. The cases were typi[INVESTIGATOR_582368], cancer 
therapy -related MDS/AML. All patients had received platinum -containing chemotherapy 
regimens,  and many had also received other DNA -damaging agents and radiotherapy. Some  of 
the patients had a history of bone marrow suppression. For suspected MDS/AML or prolonged 
haematological toxicities, the patient should be referred to a haemaotologist for further 
evaluation. If MDS and/or AML is confirmed, then niraparib should be per manently 
discontinued and the patient should be treated appropriately.  
10.3.9.  Pregnancy  
The Investigator must report all pregnancies and the outcomes to the Sponsor. The Sponsor has 
the responsibility to monitor the outcome of all pregnancies reported during the clinical study.  
Each pregnancy must be reported by [CONTACT_14549] [ADDRESS_765995] follow -up all pregnancies, document the course and the outcome, and report 
this information to the Sponsor on  a Pregnancy Outcome Report Form within 24 hours of 
becoming aware - even if the patient was withdrawn from the study or the study has finished.

  11. STATISTICS  
Details of the statistical analyses presented below will be provided in the study’s stati stical 
analysis plan (SAP). A change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require 
a protocol amendment only if it alters a principal feature of the protocol. The SAP will be 
finalized prior to database lock. Any changes to the method s described in the plan will be 
described and justified in the final clinical study report.  
All analyses will include summary statistics, including the number and percentage for categorical 
variables and the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, me dian, minimum, and 
maximum for continuous variables. Time -to-event analyses will be performed using the 
Kaplan -Meier method. Two -sided 95% CIs will be provided where appropriate. Time -to-event 
data may be censored according to criteria provided in the SAP.  Further details will be provided 
in the SAP.  
No formal statistical testing will be performed.  
11.1. Sample Size Determination  
The sample size of the study is driven by [CONTACT_53229]:  PFS18. A sample size of 
90 patients will provide an 11% precision on t he 95% exact CI of PFS18, assuming a true PFS18 
rate of 48%, which corresponds to a median PFS of 17  months based on exponential PFS 
assumption. The primary endpoint analysis will occur after approximately 3  months of 
enrollment and an additional 18 months  of follow -up.  
11.2. Analysis Populations  
Three analysis populations will be defined as follows:  
• Safety population:  All patients who receive any amount of study treatment (ie, any amount 
of bevacizumab or niraparib during the study) . All safety endpoints will be assessed in the 
safety population.  
• Efficacy population:  All patients who receive any amount of niraparib (at least 1  dose). 
Analyses of baseline characteristics and the primary analysis of efficacy endpoints will be 
perform ed on the efficacy population.  
• Per-protocol population:  All patients in the efficacy population who have no major protocol 
violations during the study and have at least 1 protocol -required postbaseline tumor 
assessment.  
11.3. Demographics, Medical History, Base line Characteristics, and 
Concomitant Medications  
Demographics, baseline characteristics, and medical history information will be summarized for 
the Safety population using descriptive statistics. No formal statistical comparisons will be 
performed.  
Demogr aphics, baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, and medical history data for 
each patient will be provided in data listings.

The primary endpoint for the study, PFS18, will be estimated using percentage with 95% exact 
CI. In addition, the probability of PFS at 18 months will be es timated using the Kaplan -Meier 
method.   
Time -to-events endpoints (ie, PFS, RECIST or CA -[ADDRESS_765997]) will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier method. A sensitivity 
analysis will be performed on PFS18 by  [CONTACT_582394] -[ADDRESS_765998] evaluating change in symptoms and QoL will be conducted. Time to 
symptom worsening on the FOSI will be analyzed using time -to-event methodology.  
No formal statistical testing will be performed.  
 
In addi tion, biomarkers will be evaluated retrospectively. Further details will be provided in the 
SAP.  
11.5. Safety Analyses  
The safety and tolerability of niraparib in combination with bevacizumab will be analyzed based 
on the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, changes in ECO G performance status, changes in clinical 
laboratory results (hematology and chemistry), vital sign measurements, observations during 
physical examination, and use of concomitant medications. The i ncidence of TEAEs and use of 
concomitant medications will b e summarized. Clinical laboratory parameters and vital signs will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_319650]. Descriptive summary statistics for observed values as well as 
changes from baseline will be presented.  
All AEs will be coded using the current version of the MedDRA coding system and displayed in 
tables and data listings using system organ class and preferred term. AESIs will be summarized 
for each AESI category and preferred term.  
The number and percentage of patients with any TEAE, with any TEAE assessed by t he 
Investigator as related to treatment (definite, probable, or possible relationship), and with any 
SAE will be summarized. In these tabulations, each patient will contribute only once (ie, the 
most related occurrence or the most intense occurrence) to ea ch of the incidence rates in the 
descriptive analysis, regardless of the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].

12.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a patient into the study, a representative of the Sponsor 
will visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other  personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives. This 
will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor and the 
Investigator.  
During the study, a monitor  from the Sponsor or representative will have regular contacts with 
the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adher ing to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case report 
forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each patient 
(eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previou sly sent to the Sponsor  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs, and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the Sponsor and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting 
have been forwarded to the IRB  
The monitor will be available between  visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
12.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perf orm audits or inspections, 
including source data verification. The purpose of a Sponsor audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines of the 
International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The 
Investigator should contact [CONTACT_582395] a regulatory agency about 
an inspection.

Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstr ate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions.)  
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as referen ce the smallest sum diameters while on study  
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient 
to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level abov e the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status. It must be representative of overal l disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_62484], and the progression status should be confirmed at 
a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressi ve disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

progression.  
Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  
Every effort should be made to document the obje ctive progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment.

  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded)  until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measure ment criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of SD:  SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression 
are met, taking as reference the smallest measure ments recorded since the treatment started, 
including the baseline measurements.

Preamble  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects,  including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving 
human subjects to adopt these principles.  
General  Principles  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with t he words, “The health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical 
Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing 
medical care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and rights 
of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician’s 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects.  
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development, and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and

Confidential   Page 84 of 89 
  therapeutic interventions (methods, pro cedures, and treatments). Even the best proven 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility, and quality.  
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure re spect for all 
human subjects and protect their health and rights.  
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal 
can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, 
health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of 
personal information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of 
research su bjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals 
and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent.  
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal, and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries, as well as applicable 
international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal, or 
regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research 
subjects set forth in this  Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimises possible harm to the 
environment.  
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_320421], training, and qualifications. Research on 
patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately 
qualified physician or other health care professional.  
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropri ate 
access to participation in research.  
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients 
in research only to the extent that this is justified by [CONTACT_151084], diagnostic, 
or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in 
the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as 
research subjects.  
15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of 
participati ng in research must be ensured.  
Risks,  Burdens, and Benefits  
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and 
burdens.  
 Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of 
 the objective out weighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.  
17. All medical research involving human subjects must be preceded by [CONTACT_582397] , Bevacizumab  CONFIDENTIAL  
TMF -14428002  3000 -02-004/[COMPANY_004] [ADDRESS_766014] s, and information regarding provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research 
study.  
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial 
provisions . 
Research  Ethics  Committees  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance, and 
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This 
committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be indep endent of the researcher, 
the sponsor, and any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into 
Niraparib , Bevacizumab  CONFIDENTIAL  
TMF -14428002  3000 -02-004/[COMPANY_004] [ADDRESS_766015] submit a final report to the  
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.  
Privacy and  Confidentiality  
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the 
confidentiality of their personal information.  
Informed  Consent  
25. Particip ation by [CONTACT_54126]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or 
community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in 
a research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each 
potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, 
any possible conflicts of interest,  institutional affiliations of the researcher, the 
anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study, and the discomfort it may entail, 
post-study provisions, and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject 
must be informed of the ri ght to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent 
to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the 
specific information needs of individual potential subjects, as well as to the methods used 
to deliver th e information.  
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or 
another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely -given 
informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent  cannot be expressed in writing, the 
non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general 
outcome and results of the study.  
27. When seeking informed consent  for participation in a research study the physician must 
be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the 
physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be 
sought by [CONTACT_582398].  
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative. These 
individu als must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for 
Niraparib , Bevacizumab  CONFIDENTIAL  
TMF -14428002  3000 -02-004/[COMPANY_004] [ADDRESS_766016]’s dissent should be respected.  
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious pati ents, may be done only if the physical or mental condition 
that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research   group. 
In such circumstances, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally 
authorised representativ e. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot 
be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific 
reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed 
consent hav e been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a 
research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as 
possible from the subject or a legally authorised representative.  
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to 
withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship.  
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on 
material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek 
informed consent for its collection, storage, and/or reuse. There may be exceptional 
situations whe re consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such 
research. In such situations , the research may be done only after consideration and 
approval of a research ethics committee.  
Use of Placebo  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens, and effectiveness o f a new intervention must be tested 
against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  
Where for compelling and scientifica lly sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention  
and the patients who receive any intervention l ess effective than the best proven one, 
placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible 
harm as a result of not receiving the best proven intervention.  
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
Post-Trial  Provisions

with informed consent from the p atient or a legally authorised representative, may use an 
unproven intervention if in the physician’s judgement it offers hope of saving life,

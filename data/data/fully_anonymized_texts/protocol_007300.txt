2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary  Objective  
 
1) To evaluate  whether  receiving  romiplostim  after HDT-AHCT  decreases  the number  of 
days requiring  platelet  transfusions  or grade  [ADDRESS_92512]  
 
Secondary  Objectives  INTERVENTION 
• Romiplostim  3.0 mcg/kg  SC on Day +1 and Romiplostim  2.0 mcg/kg  
SC on Day +[ADDRESS_92513].  Beyond  Day +8, patients  will be 
treated  weekly  until platelet  count  is >50,000/mcL,  without  any platelet  
transfusions  in the prior 48 hours.  All doses  after the second  
Romiplostim  dose  will be titrated  as per Table  3, based  on weekly  
CBC/platelet  counts.  Patients  will receive  a maximum  of six weekly  
doses  of romiplostim.  
➢ Romiplostim  doses  after Day +[ADDRESS_92514] a +2 day window  
• Lab assessments:  
➢ CBC,  CMP,  and Immature  Platelet  Fraction  every  day from day 
of AHCT  (Day  0) until Day +15. All patients  will get at least 
weekly  (+/- 3 days)  labs until day +30. Patients  who need  3 or 
more  doses  of romiplostim  will get weekly  (+/- 3 days)  labs as 
long as their platelet  count  is ≥25,000.  For patients  who need  3 
or more  doses  of romiplostim  they will receive  labs every  
second  day until their platelets  are ≥25,000.  
➢ LDH,  PT/INR,  APTT  every  7 days (+/-2 days)  from Day +1 until 
Day +15. 
➢ CBC,  CMP,  Immature  Platelet  Fraction,  LDH,  PT/INR,  and 
APTT  will be done  at days +30 (+/- 7 days),  +60 (+/- 7 days)  
and at +100  (+/- 14 days)  from AHCT.  TARGET PATIENTS 
Adult  patients  ≥ 18 years  old undergoing  high-dose  therapy  and autologous  
hematopoietic  cell transplantation  (HDT -AHCT)  for : Multiple   myeloma  (MM),   Hodgkin  
lymphoma  (HL) or non-Hodgkin   lymphoma  (NHL).

1) To evaluate  whether  romiplostim  can reduce  the number  of platelet  transfusions  issued  
during  the AHCT  admission  
 
2) To evaluate  whether  romiplostim  can reduce  the time to platelet  engraftment  after HDT- 
AHCT  Platelet  engraftment  is defined  as the first day of seven  consecutive  days with a 
platelet  count  of ≥20 K/mcL  without  transfusion  support.  
 
3) To evaluate  whether  romiplostim  can reduce  the length  of stay of AHCT  
 
4) The safety  profile  of romiplostim  will be assessed  in this patient  population  during  the 
course  of the study  as per Section  11.0 Toxicities/Side  Effects.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_92516] and Chemotherapy -Induced  Thrombocytopenia  (CIT)  
 
High-dose  therapy  and autologous  hematopoietic  cell transplantation  (HDT -AHCT)  remains  a 
standard  of care consolidation  strategy  for patients  with multiple  myeloma  (MM)   that provides  
prolonged  disease -free survival.1,[ADDRESS_92517]  is also a potentially  curative  modality   
for patients  with relapsed,  chemosensitive  Hodgkin  lymphoma  (HL) and non-Hodgkin  
lymphoma  (NHL).3,[ADDRESS_92518]  commonly  used  
conditioning  regimen  is BEAM  [carmustine,  etoposide,  cytarabine,  and melphalan]  followed  
by [CONTACT_84838] [cyclophosphamide,  carmustine,  and etoposide].4–6   In recent  years,  for patients  with 
central  nervous  system  lymphoma  (CNSL),  our group  and others  have successfully  utilized  
an intensive  conditioning  regimen,  TBC [thiotepa,  busulfan,  and cyclophosphamide.]7–[ADDRESS_92519]  prior to engraftment,  notably  thrombocytopenia.  Currently,  the 
management  of chemotherapy -induced  thrombocytopenia  (CIT)  is supportive  with platelet  
transfusions  per the discretion  of the treating  medical  oncologist.[ADDRESS_92520]  platelet  transfusion  threshold  is to transfuse  
if platelets  are < 10,000/mcL.  For outpatient  stem  cell transplantations,  the standard  platelet  
transfusion  threshold  is to transfuse  if platelets  are < 20,000/mcL.  Patients  may also be 
transfused  for any platelet  count  if necessary  for clinical  reasons,  if deemed  appropriate  by 
[CONTACT_56951].  Even  after neutrophil  engraftment,  thrombocytopenia  often  delays  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84831].11,[ADDRESS_92521]  from 2014  
through  2016.  The key parameters  presented  are platelet  transfusions  issued  (mean,  
median,  range),  day to platelet  engraftment,  day to neutrophil  engraftment,  and length  of 
stay. Neutrophil  engraftment  after transplantation  is defined  as an absolute  neutrophil  count

Romiplostim – Mechanism of Action and Clinical Activity 
 
Romiplostim  (Nplate®)  is a thrombopoietin  (TPO)  mimetic  that binds  to the TPO receptor  
(Mpl).13  It is a ‘peptibody’  formed  by [CONTACT_84839]1 monoclonal  
antibody  with four TPO mimetic  peptides.  It binds  the distal  cytokine  homology  region  of the 
TPO receptor  leading  to the activation  of the JAK/STAT  pathyway.[ADDRESS_92525]  leading  to activation  of anti-apoptotic  pathways  
resulting  in increased  platelet  production.  Romiplostim  is FDA approved  for use in chronic  
immune  thrombocytopenia  (ITP),  and it has been  shown  to increase  and maintain  platelet  
counts  in splenectomized  and non-splenectomized  patients  with few adverse  effects.15,16  To 
date,  no anti-TPO antibody  formation  of clinical  significance  has been  reported.  In several  
trials of patients  with ITP, the mean  therapeutic  dose  of romiplostim  to achieve  a platelet  
count  of 50-200,000/mcL  was 3-4 mcg/kg.10,14 
At MSKCC,  our Hematology  Service  has extensive  experience  using  romiplostim  for 
chemotherapy -induced  thrombocytopenia  (CIT),  in patients  with advanced  stage  solid tumor  
malignancies.18  The goal of romiplostim  therapy  was improvement  and maintenance  of 
platelet  counts  to >100,000/mcL  in order  to allow  for the resumption  and continuation  of 
cancer -directed  therapy.  The results  of an investigator -initiated,  phase  II,  open -label clinical

platelet  counts  were  eligible  to crossover  to the romiplostim  arm. A total of 40 patients  were  
enrolled,  with 32 patients  receiving  up-front romiplostim  and 8 observation  patients.   27 of the 
32 (84%)  of the romiplostim -treated  patients  corrected  their platelets  to target  goal within  3 
weeks.  After correction  of their platelet  count,  25 of these  patients  resumed  chemotherapy,  
and all but one were  able to maintain  their scheduled  chemotherapy  treatments  without  
recurrence  of CIT.  The mean  effective  romiplostim  dose  was 2.5 mcg/kg  (range  1.8-4.1). 
Importantly,  there  were  no observed  adverse  effects  on the bone  marrow.   Four patients  
(12.5%)  of the [ADDRESS_92527]

standards  as detailed  in Section  9.0 Treatment/Intervention  Plan.  
Regardless  of the conditioning  regimen  received,  all patients  will receive  romiplostim  3.0 
mcg/kg  SC on Day +1 and romiplostim  2.0 mcg/kg  SC on Day +[ADDRESS_92535].  Beyond  
Day +8, patients  will be treated  until platelet  count  is >50,000/mcL,  without  any platelet  
transfusions  in the prior 48 hours.  All doses  after the second  romiplostim  dose  will be titrated  
as per Table  3, based  on weekly  CBC/platelet  counts.  No patient  will receive  more  than six 
doses  of romiplostim,  even if platelets  have not corrected  by [CONTACT_2006] +42. 
If there  is a medical  circumstance  wherein  the platelets  decrease  to <20,000/mcL,  
romiplostim  can be resumed  during  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84832].  Throughout  the study,  all patients  will receive  weekly  doses  of 
romiplostim.

5.1 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  & NON -THERAPEUTIC  ASSESSMENTS  
 
Romiplostim,  a TPO mimetic,  is an Fc-peptide  fusion  protein  (peptibody)  that activates  
intracellular  transcriptional  pathways  leading  to increased  platelet  production  via the TPO 
receptor  (known  as cMpl).  The peptibody  molecule  contains  two identical  single -chain  
subunits,  each  consisting  of human  immunoglobulin  IgG1 Fc domain,  covalently  linked  at the 
C-terminus  to a peptide  containing  two thrombopoietin  receptor -binding  domains.  
Romiplostim  has no amino  acid sequence  homology  to endogenous  TPO.  Romiplostim  is 
produced  by [CONTACT_84841] (E coli).14,[ADDRESS_92536]-binding  domains  and 
an Fc fragment.  The peptibody  is produced  by [CONTACT_84842] (E coli). Though  it has no amino  acid sequence  homology  to endogenous  thrombopoietin  
(eTPO),  romiplostim  is an agonist  of the thrombopoietin  (TPO)  receptor  and signals  and 
activates  intracellular  transcriptional  pathways  to increase  platelet  production.  
Romiplostim  is supplied  as a sterile,  preservative -free lyophilized  white  powder  ready  for 
reconstitution.  It is supplied  for single  use in 5 cc Type  I glass vials containing  625 μg of 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

10.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
Patients  will be enrolled  prior to admission  for HDT-AHCT,  and they will undergo  their 
planned  AHCT  for their respective  hematologic  malignancy  as per institutional  standards.  
A. Regardless  of the conditioning  regimen  received,  all patients  will receive  romiplostim  3.0 
mcg/kg  SC on Day +1 and romiplostim  2.0 mcg/kg  SC on Day +[ADDRESS_92545].  
Beyond  Day +8, patients  will be treated  until platelet  count  is >50,000/mcL,  without  any 
platelet  transfusions  in the prior 48 hours.  All doses  after the second  romiplostim  dose  
will be titrated  as per Table  3, based  on weekly  CBC/platelet  counts.  Patients  will receive  
a maximum  of six weekly  doses  of romiplostim.  
B. Laboratory  Assessments  
a. CBC,  CMP,  and Immature  Platelet  Fraction  every  day from day of AHCT  (Day  0) 
until Day +15.  All patients  will get at least weekly  (+/- 3 days)  labs until Day +30. 
Patients  who need  3 or more  doses  of romiplostim  will get weekly  (+/- 3 days)  
labs as long as their platelet  count  is ≥25,000.  For patients  who need  3 or more  
doses  of romiplostim  and whose  platelet  counts  are <25,000  they will receive  labs 
every  second  day until their platelets  are ≥25,000 . 
b. LDH,  PT/INR,  APTT  every  7 days (+/-2 days)  from Day +1 until Day +15. 
c.   CBC  with differential,  CMP,  Immature  Platelet  Fraction,  LDH,  PT/INR,  and APTT  
will be done  at days +30 (+/- 7 days),  +60 (+/- 7 days)  and at +100  (+/-14 days)  
from AHCT.  
C. If there  is a medical  circumstance  wherein  the platelets  decrease  to <20,000/mcL,  
romiplostim  can be resumed  during  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84834].  However,  a patient  will not exceed  six total doses  of 
romiplostim.  
D. If there  is a medical  circumstance  (e.g. prolonged  infection,  sepsis,  pneumonia)  wherein  
a subject  remains  admitted  for more  than [ADDRESS_92546] dose  of Romiplostim  
(Days  +1, +8, +15, +22, +29, … +/- 2 days),  and Days  +30 (+/-7 days),  +60 (+/-7 days),  
and +100  (+/- 14 days)  from AHCT.

11.1 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
The following  assessments  will be made  during  the study  to assess  efficacy  and safety.  See 
Table  [ADDRESS_92548]  (Day 0) until day +[ADDRESS_92549] weekly  (+/- 3 days)  labs 
until day +30. Patients  who need  3 or more  doses  of romiplostim  will get weekly  
(+/- 3 days)  labs as long as their platelet  count  is ≥25,000.  For patients  who need  
3 or more  doses  of romiplostim  and whose  platelet  counts  are <25,000  they will 
receive  labs every  second  day until their platelets  are ≥25,000.  
b. LDH,  PT/INR,  APTT  every  7 days (+/-2 days)  from Day +1 until Day +15. 
c. CBC  with differential,  CMP,  Immature  Platelet  Fraction,  LDH,  PT/INR,  and APTT  
will be done  at days +30 (+/- 7 days),  +60 (+/- 7 days)  and at +100  (+/- 14 days)  
from AHCT.  
d. For women  of childbearing  potential,  a pregnancy  test (negative  serum  or urine  
hCG)  must  be done  at the end of treatment  visit, [ADDRESS_92550] dose  of 
romiplostim.  
Safety  endpoints  will include  change  in typi[INVESTIGATOR_84835],  venous  or 
arterial  thrombosis,  evidence  of marrow  toxicity,  and evidence  of organ  dysfunction.  
 
12.1 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Treatment  will continue  until the occurrence  of any of the following  events:  
• Continuation  is no longer  in the patient’s  best interest  as determined  by [CONTACT_102]’s  
treating  oncologist.  
• Patient  withdraws  consent  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Major  violation  of study  protocol,  such  as non-compliance.  
• Adverse  event(s)  that, in the judgment  of the Investigator  or treating  oncologist,  may 
cause  severe  or permanent  harm  or which  rule out continuation  of the trial. 
 
Discontinuation  of Romiplostim:  
 
If a patient  develops  a Grade  3/4 adverse  event,  attributable  to romiplostim,  based  on the 
Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE  version  5), the Romiplostim  
will be discontinued.  
If a patient  develops  an asymptomatic  deep  vein thrombosis  and/or  pulmonary  embolism,  
or a symptomatic  deep  vein thrombosis  and/or  pulmonary  embolism,  not associated  with 
hemodynamic  instability,  and not considered  life-threatening,  the romiplostim  may be 
continued  if there  is consensus  of judgment  of the treating  oncologist  and study  
investigator.

13.0 CRITERIA  FOR OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  AND ENDPOINT  EVALUABILITY  
 
13.1 Criteria for Therapeutic Response/Outcome Assessment 
Primary  Endpoint  
 
1) The number  of days requiring  platelet  transfusions  or grade  [ADDRESS_92552]  
Secondary  Endpoints  
 
1) The number  of platelet  transfusions  issued  during  the AHCT  admission  
 
2) The time to platelet  engraftment  after HDT-AHCT  Platelet  engraftment  is defined  as the 
first day of seven  consecutive  days with a platelet  count  of ≥20 K/mcL  without  transfusion  
support.  
 
3) The length  of stay of AHCT  
 
4) The safety  profile  of romiplostim  as per Section  11.0 Toxicities/Side  Effects.  
 
Platelet  transfusions  will be at the discretion  of the treating  BMT attending  at will not be 
specified  in the protocol.  However,  a member  of the investigator  team  will review  the medical  
record  to determine  the reason  for the transfusion,  specified  as (a) thrombocytopenia  alone,  
(b) bleeding  attributed,  at least in part to thrombocytopenia,  and/or  (c) need  for interventional  
procedure  while  thrombocytopenia  is present.

includes  patients  with (1) MM undergoing  high-dose  melphalan  and AHCT,  (2) HL or NHL 
undergoing  BEAM - or CBV-AHCT  or (3) CNSL  undergoing  TBC-AHCT.   Further,  at least [ADDRESS_92554].  The primary  endpoint  along  with the 
secondary  endpoints  will be evaluated  in cohorts  (1) MM and (2) HL or NHL separately.  Due 
to anticipated  low numbers,  patients  with CNSL  receiving  TBC-conditioning  will be 
considered  exploaratory  only. 
The primary  endpoint  is the number  of days post HDT-AHCT  requiring  transfusions  or grade

(IQR)  of the number  of days will be used  to describe  the number  of days post HDT-AHCT  
requiring  transfusions  or grade  4 CTCAE  thrombocytopenia  for each  cohort  separately.  The 
mean  number  of days along  with a 95% confidence  interval  will additionally  be reported.  
These  summary  statistics  will be compared  to the summary  statistics  of the historical  data 
from patients  transplanted  from 2014 -2016,  presented  in Table  1. For Cohort  1 (MM),  the 
associated  standard  deviation  for the mean  of days post HDT-AHCT  requiring  transfusions  or 
grade  4 CTCAE  thrombocytopenia  is 3.5. With 20 or more  patients,  the half width  of the 95% 
confidence  interval  for the mean  number  of days for patients  treated  with  romiplostim  is  +/- 
1.[ADDRESS_92556]  deviation  is observed.  For Cohort  2 (HL/NHL),  the standard  
deviation  is 4.7, corresponding  to a half width  of +/- 2.[ADDRESS_92557] 1.5 days for Cohort  1, and/or  at 
least 2 days for Cohorts  2, this study  will be considered  sufficiently  promising.  We will then 
proceed  with a phase  II trial for the cohort  or cohorts  that reached  the above  criteria  (i.e. the 
specified  decrease  in days requiring  platelet  transfusion).  
Evaluability  criteria  for both the primary  and secondary  endpoints  are provided  in Section  13.2.  
In addition  to the primary  endpoint,  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_84836]  a number  of secondary  objectives.  
1. To estimate  the median  and mean  number  of platelet  transfusions  issued  during  
AHCT  admission.  In addition  to the mean,  the 95% confidence  interval  will be 
reported.This  will be reported  separately  for each  cohort.  
2. To estimate  the median  and mean  time to platelet  engraftment  after AHCT.   In 
addition  to the mean,  the 95% confidence  interval  will be reported.This  will be 
reported  separately  for each  cohort.  
3. To estimate  the  median  and mean  AHCT  length  of stay.  In addition  to the mean,  the 
95% confidence  interval  will be reported.This  will be reported  separately  for each  
cohort.  
4. To describe  the safety  and toxicity  profile  of romiplostim  in this patient  population.  
Toxcitiy  will be described  by [CONTACT_84850].  
15.1 TOXICITIES/RISKS/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Based  on our initial  experience,  we have not observed  treatment -related  toxicities  in our 
patients  treated  with romiplostim  for CIT.  Based  on the romiplostim  Prescribing  Information,  
the most  common  adverse  reactions  (≥ 5% higher  patient  incidence  in romiplostim  versus  
placebo)  are arthralgia,  dizziness,  insomnia,  myalgia,  pain in extremity,  abdominal  pain, 
shoulder  pain, dyspepsia,  and paresthesia.  
Individual  cases  of thrombosis  and been  reported  in patients  receiving  romiplostim,  but in

across  all studies  was 0.09 events  per 100 patient -weeks  on romiplostim  therapy,”  markedly  
lower  than would  expected  in patients  with active  cancer  receiving  chemotherapy.  We have 
not observed  an increased  thrombosis  rate compared  with expected  rates  in patients  with 
metastatic  cancer,  on chemotherapy,  however,  we will monitor  any clinical  evidence  of 
thrombosis  as well as hemorrhage.  
Assessment  of potential  toxicity  will be based  on the Common  Terminology  Criteria  for 
Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  Version  5.  We will monitor  for evidence  of marrow  toxicity,  with 
weekly  CBC  (CBC  must  include:  WBC,  Hgb, platelet,  MCV,  cell differential)  and lab toxicities  
of grade  3/4 will be adjudicated  on a regular  basis by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966].  
Toxicity  assessments  will be done  weekly  (+/- [ADDRESS_92559])  until [ADDRESS_92560] dose  of Romiplostim,  and Days  +30 (+/-7 days),  +60 (+/-7 
days),  and +100  (+/- 14 days)  from AHCT.  If a patient  is discontinuing  
chemotherapy/treatment  and going  to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]/  comfort  care,  the final toxicity  assessments  
will be omitted  if toxicities  were  managed  regularly.  
The study  will report  all toxicities  from the time a patient  signs  consent  until [ADDRESS_92561]  of care on the Adult  
Bone  Marrow  Transplant  Service  at MSKCC.  
15.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or participant  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an

SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  starts  investigational  
treatment/intervention.  SAE reporting  is required  for 30-days after the participant’s  last 
investigational  treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occur  after the 30-day period  that is 
unexpected  and at least possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
 
Please  note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention  
and is related  to a screening  test or procedure  (i.e., a screening  biopsy)  must  be reported.  
 
All patients  will be followed  for safety  and toxicity  related  to the study  drug (romiplostim).  
Potentially  serious  toxicities  are an expected  part of autologous  stem  cell transplantation.   
The reportable  adverse  events  (AEs)  and serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  associated  with 
autologous  stem  cell transplantation  will be defined  according  to the Adult  Bone  Marrow  
Transplant  (ABMT)  Adverse  Event  (AE) and Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE  Guide).  The ABMT  
AE and SAE Guide  is posted  as a Standard  Working  Procedure  (SWP)  on the Clinical

%20AE%20and%20SAE%20Guide.pdf  
 
All SAEs  must  be submitted  in PI[INVESTIGATOR_46427].  If an SAE requires  submission  to the HRPP  office  per 
IRB SOP  RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  must  be submitted  
within  [ADDRESS_92563]  be submitted  within  30 calendar  
days of the event.  
The report  should  contain  the following  information:  
 
• The date the adverse  event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event  to the treatment(s)  
• If the AE was expected  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o An explanation  of how the AE was handled  
o A description  of the participant ’s condition  
o Indication  if the participant  remains  on the study  
• If an amendment  will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form 
• If the SAE is an Unanticipated  Problem

16.1 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  PARTICIPANTS  
 
Inclusion  of Children  in Research:  
This protocol/project  does not include  children  because  the number  of children  is limited  and 
the majority  are already  accessed  by a nationwide  pediatric  cancer  research  network.  This 
statement  is based  on exclusion  4b of the NIH Policy  and Guidelines  on the Inclusion  of 
Children  as Participants  in Research  Involving  Human  Subjects.  
 
Incentives/Costs/Benefits:  
No incentives  will be offered  to patients/subjects  for participation  in this study.  Participation  is 
voluntary.  The potential  benefits  of participation  in the study  will be weighed  against  other  
treatment  options  (see below)  including  supportive  care.  The patient/subject  or their health  
insurance  provider  will be responsible  for the costs  of standard  medical  care including  MD 
visits,  routine  blood  tests,  administration  of the study  drug,  and bone  marrow  biopsies  and 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026].  The patient/subject  or their health  insurance  provider  will not be charged  for the 
study  drug romiplostim.  
 
Alternative  treatment  of patients:   Usual  care with transfusion  of platelets  when  necessary  as 
deemed  by [CONTACT_84851].  
 
16.1 Privacy  
 
MSK’s Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected health information will be limited to the individuals/entities described in the 
Research  Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be approved  by [CONTACT_84852]  (IRB/PB).

The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  were  approved  by 
[CONTACT_84853]  2018.  The plans  address  the new policies  set forth by 
[CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and Safety   
Monitoring   of Clinical  Trials.” 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_84854],  
safety  and quality.  At a departmental/PI  [INVESTIGATOR_84837](s).  Institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  include  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  staff education  on clinical  research  QA 
and two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB) for Phase  III 
clinical  trials,  report  to the Deputy  Physician -in-Chief,   Clinical  Research.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  
The MSK DSMB  monitors  phase  III trials and the DSMC  monitors  non-phase  III trials.   The 
DSMB/C  have oversight  over the following  trials:  
• MSK Investigator  Initiated  Trials  (IITs;  MSK as sponsor)  
• External  studies  where  MSK is the data coordinating  center

• Low risk studies  identified  as requiring  DSMB/C  review  
 
The DSMC  will initiate  review  following  the enrollment  of the first participant/or  by [CONTACT_84855].  The DSMB  will 
initiate  review  once  the protocol  is open  to accrual.  
The MSKCC  research  staff will submit  to [COMPANY_010],  Inc. annual  safety  reports.  These  reports  
will include  S[LOCATION_003]Rs  and pregnancy  and lactation  exposure  (and any associated  
reports/outcomes).  The reports  will be sent to the NASCR  Manager  once  per year and at the 
end of the study.  Any other  report  containing  safety  data generated  during  the course  of the 
study  will also be sent to [COMPANY_010],  Inc. at the time of submission  to any body governing  
research  conduct.  A final end of study  safety report  will be sent to [COMPANY_010],  Inc. at the time of 
submission  to any body governing  but no later than [ADDRESS_92570] study  completion.

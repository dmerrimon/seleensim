 2 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
OBJECTIVES:   
Primary objective is to show that telotristat ethyl  (Xermelo™) , a recently FDA -approved TPH inhibitor drug , 
will decrease tumoral AMT uptake and trappi[INVESTIGATOR_410424]. Secondary objective is to show that neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) will have increa sed 
AMT uptake on positron emission tomography ( PET), as compared to surrounding non -tumor tissue  at 
baseline .  
  
PATIENT POPULATION:   
1. Histopathologically confirmed, well -differentiated metastatic NETs . 
2. Patients  receiving stable -dose somatostatin analogs ( SSAs , long -acting release [ LAR], depot ) for > 
3 months before enrollment.  
 
STUDY DESIGN:   
Imaging will be done with AMT -PET/CT, under separate protocol  2011 -053, at baseline and after 9 -14 days  
treatment on telotristat ethyl , 250 mg po three times daily .  
  
EVALUATION:   
Prior to PET imaging: Physical exam, CBC and Multiphasic  (electrolytes, renal and liver function)  drawn 
within 28 days of start of the study as part of routine care . Radiology testing to measu re tumor size (for 
example, CT scans, MRI scans, PET scans) which are part of routine care.  Scan may be done within [ADDRESS_517747] PET scan.   
 
PRIMARY and Secondary ENDPOINTS:   
The m easurement of the uptake and retention of AMT  will be quantitated  by [CONTACT_410449]  (SUV max ) and compartmental modeling (in tumors with the left ventricle of the heart in 
the field -of-view) before and after treatment with telotristat ethyl.  The proportion of patients whose  
reduction in AMT uptake between baseline and follow -up is ≥20%  will be th e primary endpoint . We will 
also assess if the NET is visible above background  at baseline and will also quantify the percent difference 
in AMT uptake between the tumor mass and background . Using time -activity curves, we will also identify 
the optimal time frame where tumoral AMT uptake peaks.  
 
STATISTICAL PLAN:   
This is a single arm single institution prospective proof -of-concept  study. The proportio n of patients, who 
achieved SUVmax  reduction of 20% or more, will be estimated and exact (Clopper -Pearson) confidence 
interval will be calculated. Paired t test will b e used for pre - and post - treatment SUVs  if normality 
assumption holds . The relationship of one PET parameter to another will be visualized with scatter plot 
and measured using linear regression models .  
  
 
 3 I. OBJECTIVES  
 
1. Primary Objective: The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_410425] (NETs) using a-
[11C]methyl -L-tryptophan (AMT) -positron emission tomography (PET) as measured by [CONTACT_410450] (SUVmax).  
2. Secondary Objectives:  
a. Show that NETs will have increased AMT uptake on PET, as compared to surrounding non -
tumor tissue at ba seline  
b. Use compartmental modeling (in tumors with the left  ventricle of the heart in the field -of-
view) to measure change in AMT retention.   
c.  Measure change in AMT retention as SUVmean  
 
II. BACKGROUND   
AMT -PET to study serotonin synthesis in vivo . Alpha -methyl -L-tryptophan (AMT) is an analog of 
tryptophan, the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5 -HT, 5 -hydroxytryptamine). In the early 
1990s, Diksic and colleagues at the Montreal Neurological Institute performed extensive animal studies 
of radiolabeled AMT to validate AMT as a tracer for the measurement of the rate of serotonin synthesis 
in vivo  with positron emission tomography (PET) (Diksic et aI., 1990, 1991). After the administration of 
labeled AMT in rats, autoradiograms demonstrated a distribution of high tracer concentration in 
serotonergic cell bodies in the raphe nuclei. The synthesis of a-methyl -serotonin in brain after tracer 
administration was confirmed by [CONTACT_116141] (Missala and Sourkes, 1988; 
Diksic  et aI., 1990). The [3H] a-methyl -serotonin synthesized in brain was localized to serotonergic 
neurons and nerve terminals by [CONTACT_410451] (TPH) 
immunocytochemistry at the electron microscopic level (Cohen et aI., 199 5). In addition, [11C]AMT, unlike 
tryptophan, was not incorporated into protein in significant amounts (Madras and Sourkes, 1965; Diksic 
et aI., 1990). These studies demonstrated that [11C]AMT  was a suitable tracer for the measurement of 
serotonin synthesis in vivo  in humans with PET.  
 
Effect of inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) on AMT trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] . Autoradiographic studies with 
alpha -[14C]methyl -L-tryptophan in rats have demonstrated that  trappi[INVESTIGATOR_410426] (by 40 -80%) following treatment with p -chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), a TPH 
inhibitor (Tohyama et al., 2002). In contrast, the inhibition of protein synthesis with CXM did not have a 
significa nt effect on the global brain trappi[INVESTIGATOR_410427] 5 -HT synthesis. In another study, the TPH 
activation inhibitor AGN -2979 has led to an up to 35% decrease of AMT trappi[INVESTIGATOR_410428] 
(Hasegawa et al., 2005). These studies provided proof -of-principl e data that measurement of AMT 
trappi[INVESTIGATOR_410429].  
 
Imaging epi[INVESTIGATOR_410430] -PET. Our group at Wayne State University introduced 
the use of [11C]AMT -PET for the detection of epi[INVESTIGATOR_410431] (Chugani et al., 1998; Juhasz et al., 
2003; 2004) and a variety of cerebral and extracerebral tumors (Juhasz et al., 2006; 2009; 2012; 2014; 
 4 Bosnyak et al., 2015; 2016; 2017). High AMT transport and trappi[INVESTIGATOR_410432], 
meningio mas as well as lung cancers and breast cancers, with various tumor types showing differences in 
tryptophan uptake and kinetics. Importantly, increased AMT uptake was commonly detected even in low -
grade gliomas and meningiomas (Juhasz et al., 2006; 2011; Al konyi et al., 2012; Bosnyak et al., 2015). 
Increased uptake and trappi[INVESTIGATOR_410433].  
 
Tryptophan PET imaging in carcinoid tumors . Most NETs  have an overactive serotonin pathway with 
increased TPH activity, thus inducing carcinoid syndrome, a condition associated with tumoral secretion 
of serotonin and clinical symptoms of diarrhea, flushing , bronchial constriction, as well as the 
development of cardiac valvular fibrosis. Diarrhea is one of the most prominent symptoms of carcinoid 
syndrome. Imaging TPH activity in vivo  by [CONTACT_410452]. Although AMT -PET has 
not been tested in carcinoid tumors, studies with other amino acid PET radiotracers, including a 
tryptophan derivative (11C-5-hydroxy -tryptophan) demonstrated high se nsitivity to detect carcinoid 
tumors as small as 5mm in diameter (Koopmans et al., 2008). Highest sensitivities (81 -92%) were achieved 
in lesions located in bone, abdomen/pelvis, liver, head and neck regions. These data make it likely that 
AMT -PET will be able to detect carcinoid tumors in various locations, and it is reasonable to assume that 
its uptake and kinetic properties will be modulated by [CONTACT_410453].  
 
Serotonin and cancer proliferation . Many studies have demonstrated that serot onin may a play an 
important role in tumor growth and vascularity of breast, prostate, and many other tumor types ( Siddiqui 
et al., 2006; Sonier et al., 2006; Dizeyi et al., 2011; Sarrouilhe et al., 2015) . At high levels serotonin may 
promote tumor proliferation, while at lower levels it may even inhibit growth, in part from decreas ing 
tumor blood supply.  This is  evident in studies using a number of serotonin receptor agonists and 
antagonists, which have stimulated or inhibited growth depending on th e concentration.   
 
Telotristat ethyl is an oral small -molecule TPH inhibitor that has a high molecular weight and acidic 
moieties, which inhibit it from crossing the blood -brain barrier (Liu et al., 2008; Lapuerta et al., 2015). As 
the drug has recently be come available for clinical treatment of carcinoid -related diarrhea, there is an 
urgent need to evaluate non -invasive techniques to assess drug effects.  
 
Telotristat ethyl  has been shown to inhibit tumor growth  in a retrospective study of 200 patients with  
NET (Morse et al., 2020).  After initiation of t elotristat ethyl they observed a mean decrease of 0.6 cm in 
tumor size (p = 0.006) and decrease in tumor growth (p = 0.045).  It will be of  interest to determine using 
AMT -PET if we can measure inhibition of serotonin synthesis and serve as a biomarker in studies asses s 
this activity of this pathway.  The use of  telotristat ethyl may inhibit tumor proliferation and the image of 
AMT uptake may provide a predictive marker of this effect.  If promising, PET imaging with AMT or an 
18F-labeled analog (with a longer half -life) ( see, e.g., Michelhaugh et al., 2016; Giglio et al., 2017) could 
be useful to monitor effectiveness of TPH inhibition in future multicenter studies and clinical trials. 	
 
 5 The central hypothesis of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_410434] (i) that telotristat ethyl (Xermelo™) (Kulke et al., 2017), a 
recently FDA -approved TPH inhibitor drug, will decrease tumoral AMT uptake and trappi[INVESTIGATOR_410435]. (ii) carcinoid tumors will show increased 
AMT uptake on PET, as compared to surrounding non -tumor tissue at baseline.  
 
As a first step, in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_410436] w ill perform AMT -PET imaging in [ADDRESS_517748] the feasibility to use AMT -PET for evaluating activity 
of TPH after  inhibitor treatment.

Off-Study Criteria  
• Patients will be considered to have gone off of study following the completion of the second 
AMT-PET scan.  They may elect to continue telotristat ethyl therapy under the supervision of 
their physician  as part of standard treatment . Cost of continued standard treatment will be 
charged to the patient ’s insurance and patient.  
 
 
 
 7 V. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
AMT -PET Imaging  
• Scan 1: Baseline within 7 days prior to the start of telotristat ethyl treatment.  
• Scan 2: On d ay 9-14 of telotristat ethyl administration . 
• Patients can not eat protein containing foods for [ADDRESS_517752] water and soft drinks.   
• The final dose of telotristat  ethyl on day 9 -14 should be taken within 6 hours of the scan and 
should be taken along with high fat foods, but no protein.  This may include oils, olives, low 
protein breads with margarine.  The choice of such foods will be discussed with the patient at 
the time of enrollment.  Note that this dietary restriction only applies for scan 2 since patients 
need to take telotristat ethyl with fat.  
• Blood (approximately 3 tsp) will be drawn to measure drug levels and tumor hormone levels 
(including serotonin) in the blood prior to each  scan . These will be done by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_410438].

VII. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT: AMT PET SCAN ACQUISTION AND ANALYSIS   
 
Baseline AMT -PET scan will be obtained within 7 days of the start of telotristat ethyl 250 mg po tid and 
then again 9 -14 days after the start of treatment  under protocol 2011 -053 as described below . 
 
PET imaging will be performed using a GE Discovery STE PET/CT system (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, 
WI), located at the PET Center, Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157963]. Patients will be imaged in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (on 
their back) position on a PET/CT scanner in a high -sensitivity mode.  
 
Patients can not eat protein containing foods for 6 hours prior to the AMT -PET studies, to ensure  stable 
plasma tryptophan and large neutral amino acid levels during the duration of the study.  The final dose of 
telotristat  ethyl should be take n within 6 hours of the scan and should be taken along with high fat foods, 
but no protein  (as described in the Treatment Plan).  
 
A venous line will be established for injection of AMT tracer (0.1 mci/kg).  All PET images will be correc ted 
for attenuation using the CT scan. After injection  a CT scan is performed , immediately followed by a  60-
minute dynamic PET scan of the area of interest  that includes the tumor . The total dose for the PET/CT 
scan will be in compliance with guidelines fo r research studies prescribed by [CONTACT_410456].  
 
Quantitative assessment of AMT tumor uptake . The AMT uptake in ROIs representing tumor and non -
tumor tissue will be characterized in the following two ways:  
 
1. Standardized uptake values  (SUVs): The SUV calculation relates tracer concentration in tissue to the 
dose injected and the subject's mass (SUV = tissue concentration in ROI /injected dose per weight). First, 
decay -corrected time -activity curves will be generated to evaluate t he tumoral accumulation and wash -
out of the tracer during the scanning period. Since all subjects receive the same injected dose based upon 
weight (0.1 mCi/kg), the SUV images will be directly obtained by [CONTACT_410457] s equence during which time there is the most metabolic product. The timing of these 
frames will be determined after examination of the time -activity curves to identify the optimal time frame 
when t racer uptake reaches a plateau.  The Standard Uptake Value ma ximum (SUVmax) will measure the 
most active pi[INVESTIGATOR_410441]. Change in SUVmax will serve as the primary 
aim. Regions of Interest (ROIs) for the SUVmean will be drawn using isocontours set at 50% of the SUVmax.  
Results will be  indicated as percent change in the uptake between the two scans.  
 11 2. Compartmental modeling (in tumors with the left ventricle of the heart in the field -of-view) . In addition 
to the semi -quantitative SUV analysis, in tumors where the left ventricle of the heart is in the field -of-
view, we will also assess the data with tracer kinetic analysis using a [ADDRESS_517756] tumors (Juhasz et al., 2009; 2012). This analysis will allow a mo re 
detailed analysis of tumoral tracer transport and trappi[INVESTIGATOR_410442].  
 
 3. Primary endpoint  and secondary endpoint s:  
The proport ion of patients who achieved SUVmax  reduction of 20% or more between baseline and follow -
up will be the primary measurement.  We will also assess if the NET is visible above background at baseline 
and will also quantify the percent difference in AMT uptake between the tumor mass and background. In 
addition, u sing time -activity curves, we will also identify the optimal time frame where tumoral AMT 
uptake peaks.  The chang e in SUVmean will also be measured.  
 
VIII. STATISTICAL PLAN  
 
Design This is a single arm single institution  prospective proof -of-concept  study. Primary endpoint  is the 
proportion of patients who achieved SUVs reduction  of 20% or more . The primary endpoint will be 
reported with a one -sided, 90% confidence limit.  The other  categorical endpoints will be reported as 
proportion s with  two-sided exact 95% confidence interval s. All continuous endpoints will be reported with 
mean and standard deviation.  Paired t test will be used for pre - and post - treatment SUVs  if normality 
assumption holds . The relationship of one PET parameter to  another will be visualized with scatter plot 
and measured using linear regression models . Statistical analysis will be performed  using R version 3. 3.2. 
Power calculation:  This is a Proof -of-Concept trial where the goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and to 
show the proportion of patients who achieved SUVs reduction is at least 0.2 or higher.  Hence, we will 
calculate the minimum sample size to achieve a conf idence  lower limit no less than 0.2.  A sample size of 
6 produces a one -sided 90% low er-limit confidence interval at ( 0.201 , 1) using Clopper -Pearson formula 
when the expected proportion is 0.5.  Study Duration : The accrual rate is 6/year and minimum follow -up 
for each patient will be  3 months . The study will require 15 -18 months to complete .

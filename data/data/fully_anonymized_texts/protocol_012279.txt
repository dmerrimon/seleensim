5 of 14  1.0 Introduction and Background  
Screening for colorectal cancer is widely recommended but underused. Colorectal cancer 
(CRC) screening is  cost-effective and reduces both CRC mortality and incidence by [CONTACT_191255] -cancerous  polyps.1 –4 Regular screening for CRC beginning at age 45 is 
widely recommended by [CONTACT_52297], including  the [LOCATION_002] Preventive Services Task 
Force.5 –7 Nonetheless, over 30% of Americans are unscreened.8  
 
Screening rates are even lower among underserved populations, contributing to health 
disparities.9,10  Individuals who are Black, Hispanic/Latinx, have less education, limited income, 
or rural residences are less  likely to be screened, and thus more likely to present with 
advanced -stage CRC and die from it.11 –16 Limited  health literacy, which affects over 33% of 
American adults, further interferes with patients’ ability to access and  use health information.17 –
21  
 
Our mPATH ™ (mobile PAtient Technology for Health) digital health navigator program 
overcomes the  multilevel barriers to CRC screening. Barriers to CRC screening include patient 
factors (lack of knowledge, low  self-efficacy, fears, negative attitudes)23 –29 and 
provider/system factors (lack of time, failure to offer screening  options, lack of patient 
support).30 –34 mPATH ™ addresses these barriers by [CONTACT_191256], educating patients about screening options, and letting patients  request a test 
directly via the  program. mPATH ™ also sends patients supportive text messages to help them 
complete their chosen test.  
 
In a rigorous randomized controlled trial of 450 patients, an iPad version of mPATH ™ for CRC 
screening  (mPATH ™-CRC) doubled CRC screening rates in a population prone to health 
disparities and was well  accepted.35 –37 Patients used mPATH ™-CRC immediately before a 
scheduled primary care visit at one of six  community -based practices. Compared to patients 
randomized to usual care, twice as many patients  completed a CRC screening test (30% vs 
15%, p=0.0001).35 Patients in this study faced significant barriers to  care; over 50% reported 
annual household incomes less than $20,[ADDRESS_227439] all patients rated the user -friendliness of the program as “excellent”(82%) or 
“good”(16%).36  
 
Incorporating patient decision aids like mPATH ™ in clinical care is challenging. We are currently 
conducting a  hybrid implementation -effectiveness study of the mPATH ™-CRC iPad app in 
which office staff hand mPATH ™ to patients as part of routine care. As of August 2022,  
mPATH ™ has identified over [ADDRESS_227440] given the mPATH ™-CRC app to less than 20% of these  patients, resulting in 
tremendous missed opportunities. While our implementation study is st ill ongoing, we  
have already identified several important variables (time pressures, staff turnover, and the 
COVID19  pandemic) significantly hampering clinics’ ability to implement mPATH ™. 
 
Delivering mPATH ™ to patients at home on their own devices via the cloud is a promising 
strategy. Over 90%  of American adults have internet access at home, including 85% who own a 
smartphone.38 While home  broadband access shows a digital divide, smartphone ownership is 
similar across racial/ethnic groups.38 Even  among rural residents, those with a high school 
education or less, and individuals with annual household  incomes less than $30,000, 
smartphone ownership exceeds 75%.38 The growing ownership of smart phone and  tablet 
devices offers new opportunities to reach broadly into patient populations. We previously

Lung). In a highly pragmatic  feasibility study, we sent 1000 patients electronic invitations to use 
mPATH ™-Lung, and 41% (410) visited the  mPATH ™-Lung Web App and 85% of all visitors 
(365) completed the program. Therefore, a cloud -based  version of mPATH ™-CRC has great 
potential to reach patients and increase CRC screening independent of a  medical visit, which is 
especially important for the 15% of adults who have not seen a d octor in the last year.[ADDRESS_227441] 25% of patients who are overdue for CRC screening and use a cloud -
based version of mPATH ™-CRC will request a screening test via the program, demonstrating 
the feasibility of this strategy.  
2.0 Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
2.1.1  Evaluate the feasibility of the cloud -based version of mPATH -CRC  in a large health 
system.

women. We will oversample for non -white patients with the goal of creating a final study sample 
that is approximately 50% non -Hispanic white, at least 20% Black, and at least 20% 
Hispanic/Latinx.  We anticipate 2% or less of our sample will identify as American Indian, Asian, 
Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, or more than one race, reflecting the low prevalence of these 
races/ethnicities in the health system’s older patient pop ulation.  Translating this to our sample 
size estimate of 240, we plan to enroll at least [ADDRESS_227444] approximately 
20% of study participants to be Hispanic/Latino (N  = 48). We plan to enroll at least 20% Black or 
African American (N  = 48), 2% or less will be American Indian, Asian, Hawaiian/Pacific 
Islanders, or more than one race (N = 4). Should we not meet or exceed these estimates, the PI

3.4 Registration Procedures  
The intervention will be developed with input from focus groups. We will hold two focus groups  
of 8 – 12 patients each (one English speakers and one Spanish speakers) to review the 
animated “core content” of the video and the collected video clips of patient testimonials. We will 
give these participants a study information sheet explaining the purpose of the study, the nature 
of the data to be collected, and the voluntary nature of their participation.  
 
After the intervention is finalized, p atients will be participating in a pragmatic trial in which 
patient data collection will occur by [CONTACT_191257]. All patients will receive 
current guideline -recommended care, and we will request a waiver of patient Informed Consent.  
Therefore, it is impractical to register patients with the Cancer Center, and any such registration 
would jeopardize patient confidentiality.

8 of 14  4.0 Methods  for Intervention Creation  
4.1 Formation of Scientific and Community Advisory Committees  
To ensure the intervention is culturally appropriate and addresses relevant barriers to screening, 
we will form a Scientific Advisory Committee and a Community Advisory Committee to guide our 
work. The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) will be comprised of nationally -known 
researchers with deep expertise examining and addressing barriers to CRC screening in racial 
and ethnic subgroups. The Community Advisory Committee (CAC) will have 6 members that 
include leaders of organizations that serve the Black/Afr ican American and Hispanic/LatinX 
communities and members of those communities. We will form the CAC in collaboration with the 
Wake Forest Maya Angelou Center for Health Equity and the CTSI Program in Community 
Engagement. Both groups have deep ties to the  community. The SAC and CAC will meet at key 
points in the development of the revised mPATH ™-CRC decision aid ( Figure 2 ). At the initial 
meeting, the SAC and CAC will review and provide input on: 1) our outline for key content to 
include in the revised mPA TH™-CRC decision aid, and 2) the semistructured interview guide 
that will be used to capture patient testimonials to ensure that appropriate questions are asked 
to reveal potential screening barriers and garner culturally appropriate information.  
4.2    Video Testimonial Recruitment  
We will query the EHR to identify patients aged 45 to 75 with a preferred language of Spanish or 
English who : 1) were  seen at one of three  Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist primary care 
practices , and 2) completed a screening  colonoscopy or FIT in the past [ADDRESS_227445] patient gender, race/ethnicity, age, health insurance 
status,  preferred language,  phone number,  date of colonoscopy, date of FIT, screening test 
results. We will give the primary care providers in these three practices a list of their patients 
who met our EHR inclusion criteria , and we will ask the providers to nominate  patient s who they 
think may be interested in participating in a video interview . A study team member will then call 
the nominated patients to inform them of the study , and if interested, administer a  brief eligibility 
questionnaire . Based on responses to the questionnaire, we will exclude patients with a history 
of CRC or inflammatory bowel disease.  
Our goal is to interview up to [ADDRESS_227446] diversity in age, race/ethnicity, 
gender, and type of screening test completed.  We will schedule each participant for an 
individual 20 -30 video intervie w held in a private location. Interviews will be conducted in the 
patient’s preferred language, either English or Spanish. A trained interviewer will conduct each 
interview using a semi -structured interview guide.  We will select clips from these interviews for 
potential inclusion in the revised CRC video decision aid.

gender, race, insurance status, and screening status.  We plan include between 16 -24 
participants in total for these focus groups .  
4.4    Focus Group Sessions  
A trained moderator will lead each focus group using a moderator’s guide developed by [CONTACT_58860]. Each focus group will first review the animated core content of the CRC screening 
video decision aid. Questions from the moderator’s guide will probe to d etermine if any parts of 
the video could be improved for clarity or acceptability. Participants will then review the patient 
testimonial clips grouped by [CONTACT_122106] (motivators, barriers, rationale). We will ask participants to 
identify which testimonials they feel should be included in the final video and why. Next, each 
focus group will be presented with the sample outreach messages generated with the input from 
the Scientific Advi sory Committee ( SAC) and Community Advisory Committee ( CAC ). The 
moderator’s guide will explore participants’ reactions to the messages, content/language that is 
viewed favorably or unfavorably, and suggestions for improving the messages. Additionally, 
focus groups will be asked to suggest their own messages that would motivate others  to use 
mPATH ™. Each participant will receive a $[ADDRESS_227448]. Results from the focus groups will be 
used to finalize the CRC screening decision aid video and outreach messages for the pragmatic 
trial. 
The full moderator’s guide will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval prior to being 
used.

they are  aged  [ADDRESS_227450] a smartphone . Patients who are interested in participating will 
be asked to use the web app on their own smartphone . They will be asked questions about  the 
web app’s usability . Results from the interviews will be used to finalize the program.  Patients will 
receive a $[ADDRESS_227451] IRB to allow our highly 
pragmatic  testing since the mPATH ™-CRC web application delivers guideline recommended 
care and not experimental care.  
Each week we will query the EHR to randomly select [ADDRESS_227452] of current CRC screening. We will oversample by [CONTACT_55494]. We will then 
randomize these 240 patients, to receive one of four outreach messages with equal probability.  
Patients will receive the invitation message  as a HIPAA -compliant text message. Each invitation 
message includes an embedded hyperlink to the web app appended with an anonymous study 
identifier that allows us to track who visits mPATH ™. A reminder message will be sent once 
weekly for two weeks (no more than 3 messages total). We will continue to send weekly 
outreach messages until 120 patients who are overdue for CRC screening  complete the 
mPATH ™-CRC web app.

10 of 14  Low socioeconomic status individuals are more likely to suffer health disparities from colorectal 
cancer. Therefore, it is critically important to include low income participants in colorectal cancer 
screening studies. To avoid coercion, participant incent ives will not exceed $50.  
5.2 mPATH™-CRC Intervention  
The mPATH ™ homepage will inform visitors that by [CONTACT_191260], their deidentified data 
may be used in research. The mPATH ™-CRC Web App takes approximately [ADDRESS_227453] no risk factor that would 
necessitate specialize d screening considerations. Patients with a risk factor will be informed of 
their risk status and encouraged to discuss screening  with their primary care provider. Patients 
who are confirmed due for CRC screening and are at average risk will then be shown our 
updated animated and narrated CRC screening decision aid video that reviews the CRC 
screening tests offered by [CONTACT_191261] e organization: colonoscopy, FIT -DNA, and FIT. 
Lastly, patients can request a CRC screening test directly through the mPATH ™ program. 
mPATH ™ automatically transmits test requests to the appropriate personnel (patient navigators 
or clinical staff) at our pa rtnering healthcare organizations via its secure referral dashboard. 
These personnel then ensure requested home -based testing is delivered or colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_191250]. Patients who request a screening test have the option to sign up for automated text 
message reminders to help them complete their chosen test, as we used in our prior study.35 
5.3 Usual Care  
Patients who are not randomly selected to receive a n invitation will receive usual care, which 
includes the organizations’ standard procedures for addressing CRC screening. At AHWFB, the 
EHR flags patients who are overdue for CRC screening as a “care gap” that is visible to all 
primary care providers.

6.2 Exploratory  Outcome  
6.2.1  Proportion of participants who complete the CRC screening eligibility questions within  4 
weeks  of the initial invitation  using  the mPATH -CRC Web App .  
7.0 Analytic Plan  
 
7.1 Sample Size and Power  
We will consider that the cloud -based mPATH ™-CRC program is feasible for increasing CRC 
screening uptake if at least 25% of patients who complete the app request a screening test via 
mPATH STTR  (Phase I)  
Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center  
WFBCCC  # TBD  || ClinicalTrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
11 of 14  the program. We chose 25% as our threshold because we acknowledge that patients may not 
complete screening tests they request. If only half of patients complete their requested test 
(which is what we observed in our prior trial), a 25% test -request rate wo uld increase overall 
screening rates by 12.5%, a clinically meaningful effect for a low cost intervention . 
In our ongoing study of the iPad -version of mPATH ™-CRC, 38% of patients who complete the 
program are requesting a screening test. Conservatively assuming the actual rate of requesting 
a screening test in the cloud -based version is 30%, a sample size of 120 patients will result in a 
90% probability of demo nstrating feasibility by [CONTACT_164468] a rate of at least 25%. Therefore, 
messages will be sent until [ADDRESS_227455] completed the app in order to evaluate feasibility. 
Full operating characteristics of this  feasibility design for a sample size of 120 are included in 
table below.  
 
In our ongoing trial of the iPad version of mPATH ™, 50% of patients who have no record of 
current CRC screening in the EHR report current screening in the mPATH ™ app. Based on this 
experience, we will conservatively estimate that 25% of patients will respond to our invitations 
and 50% of patients who use mPATH ™ will meet our inclusion criteria of being due for CRC 
screening (with no risk factors) resulting in an overall weekly accrual rate of 30 patients (25% x 
50% x 240). Therefore, while the sample size for our main feasibility outcome of screening 
decisions is 120 patients, approximately 1000 (250 per message) patients will receive an 
invitation for our exploratory analysis of message response rates. With a sample size of 250, the 
proportion who use  the web app can be estimated to +/ - 6.4% based on a 95% confidence 
interval. Based on oversampling for race/ethnicity, we anticipate that at least 50 patients from 
each race/ethnicity group will receive each message.  With a sample size of 50, the proporti on 
who use the web app can be estimated to +/ - 14.5% based on a 95% confidence interval. The 
precision estimates are based on a 50% response rate as this gives the maximum half -width of 
a confidence interval, and therefore provides the most conservative es timate around precision.  
7.[ADDRESS_227456] 25% of patients who complete the app (regardless of 
randomization group) request a screening test via the program. Completion of the app is defined 
as using the program to a point of indicating their screening decision.  This proportion will be 
reported along with a 95% confidence interval.  
7.3 Analysis of Exploratory  Outcome  
Use of the web app will be defined as completing the web app’s eligibility questions for CRC 
screening. For each of the four messages, we will calculate the proportion who use the web  app 

mPATH STTR  (Phase I)  
Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center  
WFBCCC  # TBD  || ClinicalTrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
12 of 14  with a 95% confidence interval. We will also calculate the proportion who use the web app with 
a 95% confidence interval separately for each race/ethnic group for each of the four messages. 
We will assess for differences in response rates between messages using chi -square tests or 
Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate. All tests will be 2 -sided with a significance level of 0.05.  
 
7.4 Estimated Accrual Rate  
Based on our ongoing trial experience, we will conservatively estimate that 25% of patients will 
respond to our invitations and 50% of patients who use mPATH will meet our inclusion criteria of 
being due for CRC screening without any risk factors  resulting in an overall weekly accrual rate 
of 30 patients (25% x 50% x 240) . We plan to closely monitor the accrual rate a nd will 
discontinue sending messages once [ADDRESS_227457] used the app.

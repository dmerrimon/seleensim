CLINICAL INVESTIGATION PLAN ( CIP) SYNOPSIS  
 
INVESTIGATION TITLE :  
A clinical investigation to study the effect of Exufiber Ag+ and other gelling fibre 
dressings on wound exudate and bioburden in medium to high exuding wound.  
 
Objectives  
This investigation is undertaken to investigate the impact of Exufiber Ag+ and other gelling  fibre 
dressings on handling exudate, changes in aerobic counts and microbial diversity of bioburden by 
[CONTACT_785638], in medium to high exuding wound.  
Primary objective  
• To evaluate reduction  in exudate from baseline to last visit *. 
Secondary  objective  
• To evaluate changes in bioburden from baseline to visit 3 . 
• To evaluate the status of the wound and peri -wound skin from baseline to last visit * 
• To evaluate the  handling and technical  performance of the dressing from baseline  to last 
visit* 
• To evaluate comfort, conformability and acc eptability of the dressing from visit [ADDRESS_1080687] 
visit* 
• To evaluate safety from baseline to last visit * 
*Last visit = Visit 5. Last vi sit occur earlier if the wound is dry or healed.  
** Distribution of patients included in the bioburden analysis can be found under 4.5.[ADDRESS_1080688] that fulfils  all the inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria . Both inpatient s and outpatient s/subjects will be eligible.

Document template: F-167 Clinical Investigation Plan  Rev: [ADDRESS_1080689] of Exufiber Ag+ and other gelling fibre 
dressing s on handling wound exudate, bioburden and possible associated molecular biomarkers . 
Each subject will be evaluated during 5 visits, with a total treatment period of  4 weeks  (28 days (± 
2 days) ) or earlier if the wound is dry  (see Table 1) or healed.  
Only one target wound  per patient  (indication specified in Appendix D, Instruction for use)  will be 
included in this investigation .  
Dressing change s will be done every 7 day s or earlier if needed according to instruction for use  
(see Appendix D)  and the sites local routines. Dressing changes will be record ed in the “Dressing 
Log”. Dressing changes between the scheduled visits will be record ed on the “ Dressing Log” at 
the next scheduled visit.  
The subject will be assigned either to Exufiber®Ag+, Exufiber® or Aquacel ™Ag Extra ™ (For 
details see  Figure 1).

and the relative amount of the various present species4. Viability PCR or Pre -rRNA analysis 
(MVT) allow a dead or alive distinction9. 
Culture testing is not as sensitive as molecular testing, so culturing often fails to detect b acteria, 
even bacteria that are present in a high relative abundance. Bacteria that are present in high 
relative abundance are likely of high clinical relevance, including the bacteria that are not 
detected by [CONTACT_921].  It also allows an absolute quantifica tion of the CFU count of the test sample5. 
Wound exudate samples can be used to identify molecular biomarkers such as enzymes, 
cytokines and metabo lites. The significance of the appearance and relative fold change of such 
biomarkers in combination with the change of bioburden of the wound is investigated and could 
provide crucial information to predict bioburden in wounds.  
Wounds that produce an excessive amount of exudate is  in an, inflammatory state. By [CONTACT_785642]. Gelling fibre dressings are 
developed to absorb and retain large amount of exudate to support an optimal wound healing 
process. Gelling fibre dressings with additional silver ions have in vitro  models shown to decreas e 
the number of microorganisms.  
Delayed healing often defined as clinical signs of infection (exudate, pain, discoloration, odour)6. 
Infected wounds are likely to be more painful and associated with high exudate levels which can 
increase the number of dressing changes required.  The negative effect on exces s exudate on 
wound healing can result in delayed healing, maceration of peri -wound skin and embarrassing

further developed range of products such as Aquacel Ag Extra and Aquacel Ag+ Extra  (not on th e 
US only EU  market) . A new antimicrobial gelling fibre dressing (Exufiber Ag+) has been 
developed and is 510(k) cleared for sales in the [LOCATION_002].  
Exufiber Ag+ has been shown to have a higher retention capacity th an Aquacel Ag Extra.  The 
non-silver v ersion (Exufiber) has been on the market for a couple of years and both clinical 
investigations and customer feedback have confirmed the dressings high performance in exudate 
management. Two in vivo  studies on pi[INVESTIGATOR_785629]+

these studies showed that Exufiber Ag+ was the most efficient treatment at reducing bioburden

Our study purpose  is to investigate the impact of Exufiber Ag+ and other gelling fibre dressing  on 
handling wound exudate, bioburden and possible associated molecular biomarkers. The study i s

2. OBJECTIVES  
This investigation is undertaken to investigate the impact of Exufiber Ag+ and other gellin g fibre 
dressings on handling exudate, changes in aerobic counts and microbial diversity of bioburden by 
[CONTACT_785638], in medium to high exuding wound.  
Primary  objective  
• To evaluate reduction in exudate from baseline to last visit*.  
Secondary  objective  
• To evaluate changes in bioburden from baseline to visit 3.  
• To evaluate the status of the wound and peri -wound skin from baseline to last visit*  
• To evaluate the handling and technical performance of the dressing from baseline  to last 
visit*

Aquacel Ag Extra is assume d to have the same identified risk as Exufiber Ag+ , since Exufiber Ag 
+  is substantially equivalent with Aquacel Ag Extra.  
The investigator should take the  above mentioned list of events in consideration when reporting 
and assessing events in accordance with section 9 of the CIP.  
Based on the risk management recor d it can be concluded , that for Exufiber Ag+ , Exufiber  and 
Aquacel Ag Extra, there are no unacceptable risks of harm for the patient, the user nor third part 
involved in this clinical investigation, if the treatment dressings are  used under normal conditions 
and within its intended use.  
Before reaching the above conclusion, the identified risks of the investigational device, which had 
been ranked for severity, occurrence and detectability according to Mölnlycke risk management 
process,  were mitigated as far as  possible in the risk management process (following ISO [ZIP_CODE], 
Application of Risk Management to Medical Devices).

4.7.2  Performance Analysis  
Primary Performance Analyses  
The primary performance analysis will be th e analysis of change in Exudate level from baseline to 
4 weeks in the Exufiber Ag+ treatment group with the two -sided Sign test on the  Intent To Treat 
(ITT)-population at significance level 0.05. If the [ADDRESS_1080727] (LOCF) will be allied from 1 week.  
A complementary sensitive analysis will be performed with the same analysis on complete cases. 
(No imputation)  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
All secondary efficacy variables will be analysed within the treatment groups  for the ITT - and Per 
Protocol ( PP) population using the statistical methods given in section general methodology. 
Primary efficacy variable will also be analysed on the PP -population  
4.7.3  Determination of Sample Size  
In the study PUMA 416, with 100 subjects treated with Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_785633], the result regarding 
change in Exudate level from baseline to 4 weeks was 56.5 % improved, 32.9 % unchanged and 
10.6 % worsened. Assuming the same proportions in this study [ADDRESS_1080728] with 95% power and significance level 0.05. If we 
expect a dropout rate of around 20% we will include 50 subjects in the Exufiber Ag+ treatment 
group .

In case of problem with  the eCRF, a paper based version of the SAE/SADE report form (available 
in the Investigator Site File) shall be used and sent by [CONTACT_20143]: 
[EMAIL_12315].  
All SAEs/SADEs that occur  during the Clinical Investigation shall be reported, whether or not they 
are considered causally related to the investigational device [or the comparator].  
Device Deficiencies that might have led to SADE if either a) suitable action had not been taken, 
b) if intervention had not been made, or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate must be 
reported as a SADE.  
The investigator is responsible for informing the EC/IRB and/or the Competent Authority of the 
SAE/SADE as per local requirements.  
PROCEDURES FOR  DD REPORTING  
All DD shall be reported to Mölnlycke  as soon as poss ible, without unjustified delay . If the DD 
might have led to a SADE the reporting requirements for SADE described above must be 
followed. DDs can be either subject related or non -subject r elated depending on if the 
investigational device was used by a subject or not. Separate forms are used for subject related 
and non -subject related DDs. When a subject related DD has been entered into the eCRF by [CONTACT_1275] /authorised site staff, th e eCRF system will automatically generate a report to:

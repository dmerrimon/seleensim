2PRÉCIS
Background:
Indolent B-cell malignancies are associated with frequent disease relapse
Standard frontline therapy includes a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody with or without 
chemotherapy; novel targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_661644]-risk molecular features
Targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_661645], treatment-emergent toxicities, 
and non-compliance
CD47 is a rational target for indolent B-cell malignancies; CD47 expression is higher in 
tumor cells than normal B-cells, and blocking CD47 results in phagocytosis of tumor cells
Magrolimab is an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody with activity in refractory indolent 
lymphomas when combined with rituximab (a first generation anti-CD20 monoclonal 
antibody)
Obinutuzumab is a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc 
receptor that may improve antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and 
phagocytosis, when combined with magrolimab
We aim to test the safety and efficacy of venetoclax when added to the backbone of 
magrolimab and obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell 
malignancies
Treatment duration will be response-adapted and time-limited in all patients
Objective:
To determine the safety of the triplet combination of venetoclax, magrolimab and 
obinutuzumab in relapsed and refractory indolent B-cell malignancies 
Eligibility:
Follicular lymphoma (FL) (grades 1-2, or 3a), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), mantle 
cell lymphoma (MCL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with [ADDRESS_892479] one of those therapi[INVESTIGATOR_661646]-CD20 monoclonal antibody 
ECOG performance status 0-2
Adequate bone marrow and organ function
Design:
Phase 1 study with expansion cohorts of up to 76 patients with relapsed or refractory FL, 
MZL, MCL or CLL 
The safety profile of magrolimab, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab will first be determined 
in a dose-finding phase of up to 24 patients (6-12 patients with FL and 6-12 patients with 
MZL, MCL or CLL). Patients without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will receive an 
additional 5 cycles (total 6 cycles) of the triplet combination.
After dose-finding is completed, expansion cohorts of each histology will first receive 
magrolimab and obinutuzumab for 2 cycles in a window for translational research. After 
the window, venetoclax will be added and patients will receive 6 cycles (total 8 cycles) of 
the triplet combination.

Version Date: 12/18/2023
3Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) (after a total of 6 cycles of the triplet 
combination) will stop treatment and initiate active monitoring with radiologic imaging 
and assays for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); if these patients relapse, they can be 
retreated with an 6 additional cycles. Patients who achieve partial response (PR) after 6 
cycles of the triplet will continue for an additional 6 cycles; then, will initiate active 
monitoring.

1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
1.2.1 Trial Design Summary
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of magrolimab added to venetoclax and 
obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed and/or refractory indolent B-cell malignancies.  The first 
portion of the study will determine the dose of venetoclax to be used during expansion.  The triplet 
combination will use a 5-week safety ramp-up of venetoclax in patients with mantle cell lymphoma 
(MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  Patients with 
follicular lymphoma (FL) will have venetoclax started at the target dose without a ramp-up. 
Patients without DLT in the dose-finding portion will be treated with an additional [ADDRESS_892483] receive a “window” of two cycles of magrolimab 
and obinutuzumab in order to define the early indicators of efficacy of this combination in indolent 
B-cell malignancies.  The primary translational endpoints will occur during this window, including 
the molecular and immunologic correlates of response and mechanisms of resistance.  After the 
window, venetoclax will be added. Patients who achieve CR after [ADDRESS_892484] PR after the initial 6 cycles of the triplet combination or those 
who discontinue treatment before 6 cycles will stop therapy and initiate active surveillance.  
1.2.2 Indolent B-cell Lymphomas: Follicular Lymphoma and Marginal Zone Lymphoma
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)( 1), 
accounting for ~25% of cases with an estimated incidence of 74,680 new cases diagnosed in 2018.  
The clinical course of FL is highly variable; many patients have indolent disease that is slowly 
progressive and defined by a perpetually relapsing and remitting course, while other patients 
experience rapid growth of lymph nodes and aggressive clinical behavior that requires therapy 
shortly after diagnosis(2, 3). FL is generally not curable with standard frontline systemic 
chemotherapy, so most patients require multiple sequential treatment regimens throughout their 
disease course.  Further, a subset of FL patients who relapse within [ADDRESS_892485] treatment.  A retrospective analysis of 588 patients 
with FL in the National LymphoCare database demonstrated that approximately 20% of patients 
experience progression of disease within 2 years of diagnosis (POD24) despi[INVESTIGATOR_661648], doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone with (R-CHOP)(4).  
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/[ADDRESS_892486] ratio for early 
death of 7.17 (95% CI, 4.83 to 10.65) compared with the reference group. 5-year survival of 
patients with POD24 was ~50%, compared with a 5-year survival rate of 90% for the remaining 
patients(4).  Early disease progression after therapy was further validated as a surrogate marker of 
poor overall survival with a pooled analysis of 13 randomized studies in FL and >5,000 patients 
known as the Follicular Lymphoma Analysis of Surrogacy Hypothesis (FLASH) dataset(5). In the 
FLASH dataset, POD24 was confirmed to be associated with poor subsequent overall survival 
(OS) (hazard ratio (HR) = 5.24; (4.63 - 5.93); p < .01).  Current research focuses on understanding 
the molecular biology of FL patients with POD24 after standard frontline chemotherapy, so these 
patients can be prioritized for treatment with novel combinations designed to overcome intrinsic 
chemotherapy resistance(6).  FL patients who relapse beyond [ADDRESS_892487] a long life expectancy, there is a need for 
time-limited treatment regimens that provide deep, durable responses, and avoid cumulative 
toxicities. 
Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is an indolent B-cell lymphoma that includes three (3) subtypes: 
nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL), extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-
associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), and splenic B-cell marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL).  
Together, these MZLs account for ~12% of cases of NHL(1).  The average age at diagnosis is [ADDRESS_892488]-germinal center marginal zone B cell and may 
present in the lymph nodes, spleen, or extranodal tissues.  The treatment approach to MZL is not 
standardized and ranges from watchful waiting, localized radiation, or systemic treatment with 
chemotherapy and/or anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies(7, 8).  Similar to FL, MZL is generally 
incurable with standard frontline systemic chemotherapy, and patients often require multiple 
sequential treatments throughout their disease course.  Although many patients with MZL will 
have an indolent disease course, some cases of MZL are associated with resistance to 
chemotherapy and/or rituximab.  Patients with MZL with short remission durations and those who 
are refractory to rituximab should be prioritized for novel treatment combinations.  
Recently, the FDA granted accelerated approval for the use of ibrutinib monotherapy in patients 
with MZL who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based 
therapy.  This approval was based on a phase 2 study of ibrutinib in 63 patients with 
relapsed/refractory MZL(9).  In this study, the overall response rate was 46% (95% CI: 33.4-59.1), 
but only 3% were complete responses.  Efficacy was observed across all three MZL types.  
However, the treatment with ibrutinib was administered indefinitely.  The treatment experience in 
CLL has demonstrated that many patients do not tolerate prolonged ibrutinib monotherapy, and 
treatment-emergent toxicities include hemorrhage, infections, cytopenias, and atrial 
fibrillation(10). 
Recommendations for clinical trial development in FL and related indolent B-cell lymphomas 
emphasize the importance of effective treatment combinations with a good safety profile able to 
provide durable clinical benefit for patients(11).  The ultimate therapeutic goal for indolent B-cell 
lymphomas is time-limited combination regimens of novel targeted agents that offer the potential 
for cure.

101.2.3 Indolent B-cell Leukemias:  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Mantle Cell 
Lymphoma
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) (henceforth called 
CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are also incurable B-cell malignancies that are considered 
separately in this protocol because they are frequently associated with a leukemic component that 
manifests with high levels of circulating tumor cells.  These patients may be more susceptible to 
specific toxicities such as tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), and hence, will receive a lower target dose 
of venetoclax on this protocol. 
CLL is the most common B-cell malignancy in developed countries and is estimated to result in 
approximately 21,000 new cases in the [LOCATION_002] in 2018.  Similar to the other B-cell 
malignancies included in this protocol, CLL predominantly affects older patients with a median 
age at diagnosis of 72 years(12).  Furthermore, treatment of CLL is generally not curative and 
patients with resistant disease or multiple disease relapses need novel combinations.  The 
combination of chemotherapy with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies has been the mainstay of 
therapy for decades, but most patients will not have durable remissions with this approach beyond 
3-4 years. Moreover, a subset of patients with CLL, such as those with TP53 aberration, either 
because of deletion of chromosome 17p or TP53 mutation, relapse very early after frontline 
chemoimmunotherapy(13).  Another important consideration is that the toxicity associated with 
chemotherapy can be challenging in patients over the age of [ADDRESS_892489] few years towards novel targeted small 
molecule inhibitors of BTK and Bcl-2( 14).  One significant advantage of these small molecule 
inhibitors is their activity in patients with high-risk features such as a TP53 aberration(15, 16).  As 
single agents, however, these targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_661649], are not curative, 
and must be taken indefinitely.  A recent 5-year follow-up study of ibrutinib monotherapy at the 
NIH in patients with both treatment-naïve and relapsed CLL demonstrated an overall 5-year PFS 
of 58.2% in patients with TP53 aberrations(17).  However, patients with relapsed/refractory CLL 
had a 5-year PFS of only 19.4% (95% CI, 6.3%-60%).  Venetoclax is a small molecule inhibitor 
of Bcl-2 that has also shown significant single agent activity in patients with relapsed CLL.  In a 
phase 1b study, the 15 month PFS of venetoclax in patients treated with the maximum dose was 
estimated at 69% and similar activity in patients with or without chromosome 17p deletions(18).  
Notably, venetoclax has demonstrated an overall response rate of 59% in patients who have 
progressed after ibrutinib(19). 
Although the treatment of CLL has been improved with the use of small molecule inhibitors, new 
challenges have arisen due to the extended durations of treatment which lead to long-term 
toxicities, noncompliance, and a significant financial burden.  A recent population-based study of 
616 patients who started on ibrutinib monotherapy for CLL showed that after only 17 months, an 
estimated 41% of patients had discontinued ibrutinib with a median time of only 7 months on 
treatment prior to discontinuation(10). The most common reason for discontinuation was 
intolerance rather than disease progression.  These data highlight the potential benefit of time-
limited treatment strategies with adequate safety profiles.  Another potential limitation of small 
molecule inhibitors as monotherapy is the infrequent achievement of complete response or 
achievement of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity. For this reason, novel treatment 
combinations have been explored that are capable of clearing MRD.  A recent study of venetoclax-
rituximab in relapsed CLL demonstrated a superior PFS compared to bendamustine-rituximab and 
this benefit was observed across all clinical and biological subgroups(20).  The improved PFS was 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
11due to the ability of venetoclax-rituximab to attain deep remissions since the landmark analysis at 
9 months showed 62.4% of patients were negative for MRD while only 13.3% of patients were 
MRD negative in the bendamustine-rituximab arm.  These data support the notion that novel 
combinations are more likely to achieve deep remissions that translate to durable clinical benefit.
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a distinct B-cell lymphoma that represents about 6% of all B-cell 
NHLs.  It is characterized by [CONTACT_941] t(11;14) translocation that results in aberrant expression of cyclin 
D1(21).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_661650], MCL is biologically and clinically heterogeneous.  A 
subset of patients with MCL have an indolent disease course and can safely have their initial 
therapy deferred without an impact on survival(22, 23).  In contrast, other patients with MCL will 
have rapid disease progression and relapse quickly after frontline therapy despi[INVESTIGATOR_661651] 
(ASCT)(24, 25).  Importantly, MCL is not curable with highly intensive chemotherapy and long-
term follow-up has demonstrated a continuous incidence of disease relapse(26).  MCL has worse 
prognosis than most indolent B-cell malignancies, partly because it occurs in older men.  The 
median age at diagnosis of MCL is ~[ADDRESS_892490] been FDA-approved for use in patients with 
relapsed MCL including the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, the immunomodulatory agent, 
lenalidomide, and the inhibitors of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), ibrutinib and acalabrutinib(27-
31).  The use of these novel targeted agents with anti-CD20 antibodies and chemotherapy has led 
to improvements in overall survival for all ages of MCL patients according to a recent analysis of 
the SEER database(32).  One particularly challenging clinical problem, however, is that patients 
who progress after ibrutinib often have a very aggressive disease course associated with poor 
outcomes.  In an international, multicenter, retrospective cohort study involving 114 patients with 
a median of 3 prior treatments, the median OS following cessation of ibrutinib was 2.9 months 
(95% CI 1.6-4.9 months)(33).  Patients with ibrutinib resistance or intolerance do not have good 
treatment choices and represent a population that needs effective novel combinations with an 
acceptable safety profile. 
1.2.4 Magrolimab 
[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Pre-Clinical Studies 
Magrolimab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD47 and is being developed in combination 
with rituximab for the treatment of both indolent and aggressive B-cell malignancies(34).  CD47 
was discovered by [CONTACT_661692] a key role in the ability of cancer cells to evade 
phagocytosis by [CONTACT_310147](35).  Cancer cells are able to overcome intrinsic 
phagocytic (“eat me”) signals via the binding of CD47 to its ligand, signal regulatory protein alpha 
(SIRP), that is expressed on phagocytic cells, including macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic 
cells (Figure 1).  The binding of SIRP on phagocytic cells to CD47 on lymphoma cells initiates 
recruitment of the src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and 
SHP-2 resulting in inhibition of phagocytosis.  CD47 expression is higher in tumor cells than in 
normal peripheral blood and germinal center B cells across a variety of B-cell NHL subtypes 
including FL, CLL, and MCL, and is associated with a worse clinical prognosis(36).  Blocking of 
the SIRP-CD47 pathway (“don’t eat me” signal) with magrolimab leads to phagocytosis of the 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/[ADDRESS_892491] shown that blocking anti-CD47 primed CD8+ T-cells for cytotoxic effects producing 
sustained responses(37).  Through these immunologic mechanisms, blocking CD47 with 
magrolimab is a promising immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy across a variety of 
malignancies(38, 39).
Figure 1:  CD47 antibody (yellow) binds to its antigen on the cancer cell, preventing its 
interaction with SIRP (“don’t eat me signal”) leading to phagocytosis of the cancer cell 
mediated through the intrinsic phagocytic (“eat me”) signals. 
In a pre-clinical study using cell lines, blocking anti-CD47 resulted in phagocytosis of tumor cells 
without an effect on normal peripheral blood cells(36).  The selective targeting of tumor cells 
compared to normal cells was postulated to be due to the presence of pro-phagocytic (“eat me”) 
signals that are not found on normal cell counterparts.  One exception to this selectivity is aging 
red blood cells (RBCs) since CD47 expression protects them from elimination.  As RBCs age, 
they accumulate prophagocytic changes in their cell membrane, which ultimately renders them 
susceptible to CD47 blockade. Thus, depletion of older CD47+ RBCs is an expected on-target 
clinical effect of magrolimab.
Magrolimab binding to RBCs may cause interference with cross-matching of units for 
transfusion.  This observation is supported by [CONTACT_661693].  First, pre-clinical and clinical 
studies have shown that the initial magrolimab priming dose leads to a pruning or cleaving of 
CD47 antigen off from RBCs, in which the remaining RBCs are found to be CD47 negative.(40) 
Given that RBCs are negative for CD47 after the initial magrolimab priming dose, RBC 
transfusion interference as well as on target RBC effects caused by [CONTACT_661694].  Second, while crossmatch interference is occasionally observed with magrolimab, 
these events are less frequently observed after the initial several doses of magrolimab.  Third, 

Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/[ADDRESS_892492] demonstrated a synergistic action between magrolimab and 
rituximab – a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody(36). In primary NHL cells incubated with either 
anti-CD47 antibody or rituximab alone, or both in combination at half of the single agent dose, 
NHL cells exhibited a significant increase in phagocytosis when incubated with the combination 
compared to either antibody alone. No phagocytosis of normal peripheral blood cells was 
observed.  When a similar experiment was performed in NSG mice deficient in T, B and NK cells, 
combination therapy eliminated disseminated lymphoma (Raji cells) in 60% of mice and localized 
lymphoma (Raji cells) in 86% of mice treated with combination treatment.  All showed no 
evidence of tumor growth, remained relapsed free, and were alive at over 197 days after tumor 
engraftment.  This is in comparison with mice treated with anti-CD47 antibody alone, which 
demonstrated a decrease in the rate of lymphoma growth but eventually had to be sacrificed due 
to enlarging tumors.
[IP_ADDRESS] Magrolimab Clinical Efficacy 
Our NCI lymphoma team has been participating in a multicenter phase 1b/2 study of magrolimab 
with rituximab in relapsed and refractory FL, MZL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   The interim results of the phase 1 component were published, and the updated 
results of phase 1b and phase 2 components were recently presented(41, 42).  A total of 35 patients 
with relapsed or refractory FL (with 3 median prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265] 85% refractory to prior 
obinutuzumab-containing regimen) have been treated on this study. Results of all patients with 
indolent lymphomas (28 FL and 1 MZL evaluable patients) were presented together – ORR was 
66% and CR rate was 24% as of February 2019. Survival data has been reported for Phase 1b FL 
patients (N=7). With median follow up of 18 months, the median duration of response had not 
been reached (range: 6.2 – 22.6+ months), including some durable CRs for > 20 months. Based on 
these results, magrolimab has achieved "Fast Track Designation" designation by [CONTACT_661695]. 
These early clinical results of magrolimab with rituximab demonstrate a potentially highly 
effective immunotherapy for FL with a safety profile that is tolerable across all age groups.  The 
achievement of CR with a novel immunotherapy platform is a promising sign that this could serve 
as the therapeutic backbone for a potentially curative regimen.  
Further development of magrolimab-based combinations is justified, but important clinical and 
translational questions remain.  First, use of magrolimab combinations should be broadened to 
related indolent B-cell malignancies included on this protocol: CLL, MCL, and MZL.  In order to 
fully maximize the potential of this therapy, a nuanced understanding of the molecular and 
immunologic correlates of clinical response is critical.  Equally important will be the identification 
of potential immune subsets that confer resistance to magrolimab-based therapy.  Lastly, the 
favorable safety profile of magrolimab allows for the addition of other active agents such as 
venetoclax with non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_661652] B-cell malignancies.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicokinetics (TK)
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_892493]-in-human Phase I study in 58 patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas 
was presented as a poster in ASCO 2018 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])(43). Multiple intravenous (IV) doses in 
the range 0.1 – 30 mg/kg were given at once or twice weekly frequencies. The PK parameters were 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
14consistent with the presence of a CD47 antigen sink (receptor binding in the blood cells and normal 
tissues), which was saturated at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg. Above this dose level, increases in Cmax and 
AUC were dose proportional and the half-life of the antibody was ~14 days – typi[INVESTIGATOR_661653]4. Similar parameters were observed in another ongoing study of magrolimab monotherapy or 
in combination with azacytidine in patients with hematological malignancies ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
Simulations with the model from the solid tumor study predicted that a maintenance dosing 
regimen of 30 mg/kg every other week from cycle 2 onwards would result in serum concentrations 
≥200 µg/mL, a level where full CD47 receptor occupancy on blood cells was observed in this 
study and where preclinical efficacy has also been previously reported. Based on these PK results, 
every other week dosing of 30 mg/kg will provide adequate drug exposure for maintenance(44). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Toxicity
Safety data in relapsed and refractory NHL is available from an ongoing Phase 1b/2 study of 
magrolimab and rituximab ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Toxicity data for 22 patients were published(41); and 
updated safety data in 115 patients were recently presented at European Hematology Association 
(EHA) annual meeting (Figure 2)(42). Overall, the treatment has been well-tolerated.  
Figure 2: Treatment-related adverse events >10% for patients treated with magrolimab
In the phase 1b portion of the study, no maximum tolerated dose was reached. Three (3) DLTs 
were observed across 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg dose levels – neutropenia (1), immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura (1), and pulmonary embolism (1).  The pulmonary embolism occurred 
after infusion of rituximab and during infusion of magrolimab on treatment Day 8.  The patient 
was found to have a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in a lower extremity in the setting of 
lymphoma disease at this site.  No evidence of hemagglutination was observed. The patient was 
restarted on treatment with a 50% dose reduction in magrolimab and did not experience further 
thrombotic events.

1.2.5 Venetoclax
[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Clinical Studies
The Bcl-[ADDRESS_892495].  The specific protein, Bcl-2, is an antiapoptotic protein that promotes cell survival.  The 
B-cell malignancies included on this protocol frequently overexpress Bcl-2 through a variety of 
mechanisms including a translocation involving BCL2 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain 
promoter [t(14;18)], chromosome 18q21 amplification, and from loss of the endogenous 
microRNAs, miR-[ADDRESS_892496] as negative regulators of Bcl-2(45-48).  Overexpression 
of Bcl-2 has been demonstrated in all of the included indolent B-cell malignancies and has been 
implicated as a resistance factor for certain therapeutic agents(49). 
Venetoclax is a selective, orally bioavailable, small-molecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor 
being developed by [CONTACT_661696]/Genentech(50). Venetoclax helps restore the process of 
apoptosis in NHL cells by [CONTACT_661697]-[ADDRESS_892497], without measurable binding to other Bcl-2 
proteins, such as MCL-1.  As monotherapy, venetoclax has demonstrated clinical activity in all 
of the indolent B-cell malignancies included on this protocol(18, 51).  In a phase I dose-
escalation study of venetoclax in relapsed/refractory CLL, 116 patients (56 in dose-escalation 
and 60 in safety expansion cohort) were treated. Patients received a median of 3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
including 86% patients who received previous therapy with fludarabine.  92/116 (79%) patients 
had an objective response including a 20% complete response rate (5% without MRD on flow 
cytometry)(18).   Responses occurred at every dose level, the toxicity profile was manageable 
and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified.  The most notable adverse events 
included upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (48%), nausea (47%), and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia 
(41%).  An important toxicity associated with venetoclax was TLS which occurred in 10/56 
(18%) patients in dose-escalation cohort.  The first three patients had laboratory evidence of TLS 
that necessitated an extended intrapatient ramp-up schedule to mitigate the risk of TLS. TLS, 
either laboratory (7/56) or clinical (3/56), occurred either after the administration of the first dose 
or immediately after rampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-up of the dose.  Of the 3 patients with clinical tumor lysis 
syndrome, 2 had severe sequelae: acute renal failure requiring dialysis and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_661656]. The third patient had a transient elevation in serum 
creatinine, which resolved within 2 days. After resolution of the tumor lysis syndrome, 9 of 10 
patients resumed taking venetoclax. Of these patients, 8 had no recurrence of TLS at subsequent 
doses. Additional toxic effects reported in all 116 patients are reported in Table 1 below.

Venetoclax monotherapy has also been studied in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL, FL, 
and MZL. In a phase 1 study, 106 patients with relapsed and refractory NHL were treated with 
escalating doses of venetoclax(51). The study population included 28 MCL, 29 FL and 3 MZL 
patients.  Risk of TLS was managed mostly as outpatients with hydration, allopurinol and 
occasional rasburicase. All patients were given escalating doses of venetoclax in a ramp-up fashion 
to minimize the risk of TLS.  Laboratory monitoring of TLS was performed at 8 and 24 hours on 
day 1 and higher doses were administered with no evidence of TLS.  Doses were further escalated 
once per week until target dosing was attained. 
No MTD of venetoclax was defined and the mean duration of treatment was 5.3 months (range, 
0.2-46).  Two DLTs occurred, both in the 600-mg dose-escalation cohort: one grade 4 neutropenia 
and one grade 3 febrile neutropenia that both resolved after dose delay and growth factor support. 
Grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in 59 (56%) patients and across all doses of venetoclax. 
Most common grade 3/4 AEs were anemia (15%), neutropenia (11%), fatigue (7%), and diarrhea 
(3%). No cumulative toxicity was apparent with prolonged dosing. Fifteen patients required dose 
reductions, including nine of the 51 patients treated at 1,200 mg dose (five for nausea, four for 
diarrhea); clinical TLS was not observed. Three patients with bulky disease (maximal lymph node 
diameter > 10 cm) had laboratory changes meeting Cairo-Bishop criteria for laboratory TLS within 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
1724 hours of initial dosing. All three patients received TLS treatment and continued venetoclax as 
scheduled without dose interruption. 
ORR of 44% was observed with responses in all subgroups with 21/28 (75%) MCL, 11/29 (38%) 
FL and 2/3 (66.7%) MZL patients having an overall response. Complete responses were achieved 
in 6/28 (21%) MCL, 4/29 (14%) FL and 0/3 (0%) MZL patients.  Patients with MCL or FL who 
achieved CRs had more durable responses than those who achieved PRs as best response. For 
MCL, responses were seen even at doses ≤800 mg (ORR, 76%, including CR rate of 24%) and not 
at a higher rate at doses higher than this. In FL, objective responses were more frequent at doses 
higher than 600 mg. A summary of adverse events in ≥20% patients is presented in Table 2.

1.2.[ADDRESS_892500] B-cell 
malignancies(53). Rituximab is a type I CD20 mAb which was first approved by [CONTACT_34033] 1997 
for the treatment of relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma(54). It has now demonstrated 
impressive clinical activity across the majority of B-cell neoplasms and is routinely used in all 
phases of NHL treatment, including first-line therapy, maintenance, and salvage therapy. 
However, the effectiveness of rituximab is ultimately limited in part by [CONTACT_661699]. Obinutuzumab is a novel type II, humanized, CD20 monoclonal Ab (mAb) 
that was developed in an attempt to overcome several postulated mechanisms of rituximab-
resistance. Obinutuzumab has been glycoengineered to reduce core fucosylation, conferring 
enhanced affinity for the human FcGamma receptor 3A (FCGRIIIa) on effector cells and, hence, 
enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)(55, 56). Compared to type I 
mAbs (i.e., rituximab and ofatumumab), obinutuzumab has lower capacity to relocalize CD20 into 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
19lipid rafts upon binding compared with type I antibodies and is a less potent in inducing 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), but more potent in mediating homotypic cell adhesion 
and direct cell death (DCD), primarily by [CONTACT_233621]-independent mechanisms(57). Enhancing DCD 
by [CONTACT_661700], as certain B-cell 
malignancies upregulate anti-apoptotic proteins that inhibit caspase-dependent suicidal 
pathway(54).
[IP_ADDRESS] Summary of Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism in Humans
The clinical pharmacology properties of obinutuzumab have been characterized in a number of 
clinical studies, in patients with CLL and indolent NHL, including FL and non-FL, and aggressive 
NHL (DLBCL). 
Important observations in both NHL and CLL patients were as follows:
Increased doses of obinutuzumab led to increases in serum obinutuzumab concentrations, 
Cmax and AUC parameters for 50-200 mg doses of obinutuzumab were less than dose 
proportional. 
For 400-2000 mg doses of obinutuzumab, there was a trend towards dose proportionality. 
However, due to low patient numbers and disease heterogeneity no meaningful conclusions 
could be made regarding dose proportionality.
At low doses of obinutuzumab (50-200 mg), administered once every three weeks over 8 
cycles, little or no accumulation in serum concentrations (Cmax and Ctrough) or exposure 
were observed over the treatment cycles. Therefore, Cmax and Ctrough values were similar 
in Cycle [ADDRESS_892501], when doses of 400-2000 mg were administered there 
were increases in serum concentration (Cmax and Ctrough) and exposure over the 
treatment cycles such that Cycle 8 values were higher than Cycle 1 values(58).
In order to provide a robust description of the PK of obinutuzumab, pooled PK data from 
1454 patients (343 CLL, 961 iNHL [814 with FL and 119 with MZL], 130 DLBCL and 20 
MCL) were analyzed together. The differences in steady-state exposure due to differences 
in body weight and gender were limited (<30%) and therefore do not warrant any dose 
adjustment for the recommended dose and regimen for obinutuzumab of 1000 mg based 
on body weight and gender. Please refer to investigator’s brochure for more details. 
Regimens with different loading and maintenance doses (from 50*2000 mg) have been 
compared to fixed-dose regimen using 1000 mg (D1, D8 and D15, C1; D1, C2 
onwards)(58). Fixed dose 1000 mg regimen resulted in similar serum concentrations to 
loading dose of 1600 mg on D1, D8 and D15 of C1 followed by [CONTACT_43249] 800 mg 
(1600/800 regimen) on D1, C2 onwards. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety and Toxicity
Safety data is available for obinutuzumab as monotherapy in CLL and indolent NHLs; and in 
combination with venetoclax in CLL. Overall the safety profile across indications is similar with 
the following exceptions:
A higher incidence of Grade 3-5 infections was observed in patients with indolent NHL, 
particularly MZL 
A higher incidence of infusion-related reactions was observed in CLL

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Monotherapy Studies
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1 Obinutuzumab monotherapy in relapsed/refractory CLL 
The safety of obinutuzumab monotherapy has been established in patients with relapsed and 
refractory CLL.  In a phase 1-2 study of 33 patients with relapsed and refractory CLL, 13 patients 
received obinutuzumab 400 to 1200 mg (days 1 and 8 of cycle 1; day 1 of cycles 2-8) during the 
phase 1 part, and 20 patients received a fixed dose of 1000 mg (days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1; day 1 
of cycles 2-8) during the phase 2 expansion(59).  During phase 1, all patients experienced infusion-
related reactions (IRRs) and 10/13 (77%) patients experienced  grade 3 AEs.  Seven (54%) 
patients had at least 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_254335]  3 neutropenia with a median duration of 10 days (range, 
7-62 days).  No patient required dose reduction, no toxicities led to withdrawal, and no deaths.  In 
phase 2, IRRs were reported in 19/20 (95%) patients and   grade 3 neutropenia was reported in 
4/20 (20%) patients.

[IP_ADDRESS].1.2 Obinutuzumab monotherapy in indolent NHL 
Safety data will be discussed from two phase 2 studies in relapsed/refractory indolent NHL. In the 
phase 2 part of a Phase 1/2 study, indolent NHL patients ([ADDRESS_892502], 1 Waldenstrom’s 
macroglobulinemia) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive eight cycles of obinutuzumab as a flat 
dose of 400/400 mg or 1,600/800 mg. Obinutuzumab was given on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1, and 
day 1 of subsequent cycles (every 21 days) for a total of nine infusions(61). The most common 
AEs were IRRs, which were experienced by 13 /18 (72% ) of patients in the 400/400-mg arm and 
16/22 (73% ) in the 1,600/800-mg arm.  The majority of IRRs were grade [ADDRESS_892503] infusion.  Only 2 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 IRRs, both in the 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
211,600/800mg arm.  No IRRs were considered SAEs, and no patient withdrew.  Other grade 3 to 4 
AEs occurring in more than one patient were infection (1 in the 400/400-mg arm, grade 4; 1 
infection in three patients in the 1,600/800-mg arm, all grade 3), lymphopenia (1 in the 400/400-
mg arm; 2 in the 1,600/800-mg arm), and neutropenia (3 in the 1,600/800-mg arm).  Twelve SAEs 
occurred during treatment: three (17%) in the 400/400-mg arm and six (27%) in the 1,600/ 800-
mg arm. 
In another phase 2 study, FL patients received obinutuzumab – four (4) once-per-week IV 
infusions of 1000 mg during cycle 1, followed by [CONTACT_39773] 2 months for up to 2 years. Safety 
analysis included 87 patients (Table 5)(62).  Sixty-four (74%) patients experienced IRR with 10 
(11%) grade 3 or 4 events.  Twelve (14%) SAEs were reported, and treatment was discontinued 
because of AEs in 8% of patients in the obinutuzumab group.

Recent data suggests that patients with MZL may be more susceptible to infections from 
obinutuzumab combinations than combinations including rituximab(63).  In a recent Phase 3 
study, obinutuzumab was evaluated in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone); bendamustine; or cyclophosphamide (C), vincristine 
(V), and prednisone (P) in patients with previously untreated advanced FL and chemo-naïve 
advanced MZL.(64) The MZL cohort included a higher percentage of patients in the G-chemo 
arm, compared with the R-chemo arm who experienced fatal AEs, Grade 3-5 AEs, SAEs and 
AEs leading to dose interruption and that the higher rate was due to a higher incidence of AEs 
with fatal outcome in the G-chemo MZL population (11.9%, compared with 4.0% for the FL 
population). The higher number of AEs primarily reflected significantly higher rate of infections.  
It is currently unknown if obinutuzumab is associated with a higher rate of infections, including 
opportunistic infections, in chemotherapy-free combinations.  However, to maximize safety 
monitoring, all MZL patients will receive prophylaxis to prevent pneumocystis jiroveci 
pneumonia and will include early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_661657] (see Section 10.4).

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Efficacy of Obinutuzumab
A Phase 1 study of obinutuzumab in dose-escalating fashion (range 50/100-1200/2000 mg) in 
patients with relapsed/refractory NHL demonstrated an ORR of 43%.  Lymphoma subtypes were 
FL (n = 13), MCL (n = 4), and SLL/CLL (n = 1).  No DLTs were observed.  Responses were 
observed in patients who  underwent prior ASCT and also in patients who were rituximab 
refractory(65).  Another phase 1 study testing obinutuzumab induction and maintenance in 
relapsed/refractory NHL showed similar results (23% ORR at the end of induction and 32% ORR 
at during maintenance therapy including 1 CR) in this group of heavily pretreated patients(66).  
Phase II enrolled 40 patients, including 34 FL patients and 1 MZL. Median number of prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 3 and 55% (22/40) patients were rituximab refractory. Two doses were tested – 
400/400 and 1600/800. ORR was 55% in 1600/800 mg group with 9% complete responses. 
However, the response rate and duration of response appeared lower at lower doses of 
obinutuzumab.  At a median follow-up of 33.7 months, the median PFS was 11.9 months in the 
1600/800 mg group (1.8-33.9+ months) and 6.0 months in the 400/400 mg group (1.0-33.9+ 
months). Median response duration in 9 previously rituximab refractory who responded to therapy 
was 8.8 months (0.7-30.8+), with three responses lasting more than 18 months( 61). In 15 MCL 
patients enrolled, 4 received 1600/800 mg dose and 11 received 400/400 mg dose. ORR was 27% 
(2/4 patients in the 1600/800 mg dose group and 2/11 in 400/400 mg dose group) with 2 CRs in 
the 400/400 mg group.  One (1) of 7 rituximab-refractory patients had a response at end-of-
treatment.  Overall median PFS for MCL patients was 2.7 months (0.3-36.1) in the 1600/800 mg 
group and 2.6 months (0.2-32.7) in the 400/400 mg group. One patient with MCL had an ongoing 
response for 30.5+ months. The remaining three patients with MCL whose disease showed 
response had response durations of 29.8, 11.2 and 5.5 months(67). 
As tested in comparison to rituximab, obinutuzumab showed trend towards a higher ORR (44.6% 
[33/74] vs 33.3% [25/75], P=0.08) than rituximab in 149 patients with relapsed indolent NHL. A 
blinded independent review panel measured a significantly higher ORR for obinutuzumab (44.6% 
[33/74] vs 26.7% [20/75], P=0.01) with an overall similar safety profile(68). 
1.2.7 Combination Studies 
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab and Venetoclax in Patients with CLL 
Venetoclax has been tested in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with previously 
untreated CLL and coexisting conditions(69).  Obinutuzumab was administered for 6 cycles 
starting with 100 mg on day 1 and 900 mg on day 2 (or 1000 mg on day 1), 1000 mg on day 8 and 
1000 mg on day 15 of cycle 1, and subsequently 1000 mg on day 1 of cycles 2 through 6. The 
daily oral venetoclax regimen was initiated on day 22 of cycle 1, starting with a 5-week dose ramp-
up from 20 mg to 400 mg, thereafter continuing at 400 mg daily until completion of cycle 12(69).  
At least one adverse event of any grade occurred in 200/212 (94%) of patients. Adverse events 
leading to drug discontinuation occurred in 34/212 (16%) of the patients. The most common grade 
3 or 4 adverse event was neutropenia. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia and grade 3 or 4 infections 
were reported in 11/212 (5.2%) and 35/212 (17.5%) of patients, respectively. Tumor lysis 
syndrome was reported in 3 patients (all cases occurred during treatment with obinutuzumab and 
before treatment with venetoclax); while 5 patients had fatal AEs during treatment with infection 
being the cause of death in 4 patients, and MDS in 1 patient.

In terms of efficacy, venetoclax-obinutuzumab group had longer 24-month PFS, when compared 
to chlorambucil-obinutuzumab group (88.2% [83.7-92.6] vs 64.1[57.4-70.8]) with consistent 
advantage in patients with TP53 deletion, mutation, or both, and in patients with unmutated 
immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes(69). The percentages of patients with both a complete 
response and minimal residual disease negativity in peripheral blood or bone marrow were 
significantly higher with venetoclax–obinutuzumab than with chlorambucil-obinutuzumab 
(peripheral blood, 42.1% vs. 14.4% [P<0.001]; bone marrow, 33.8% vs. 10.6% [P<0.001]). 
Another recent study utilized venetoclax-obinutuzumab combination for 6 cycles, followed by 
[CONTACT_661701] 1-year treatment in relapsed/refractory CLL patients.(70) 
Combination achieved responses in 95% (41/43) patients with 37% (16/43) CR/CRi. 64% (27/42) 
patients had undetectable MRD on peripheral blood ≥[ADDRESS_892504] negativity (63% [25/40]) at [ADDRESS_892505] obinutuzumab dose.
[IP_ADDRESS] Venetoclax and Obinutuzumab with Other Novel Agents 
Venetoclax has been safely combined with obinutuzumab and other novel agents in relapsed or 
refractory NHL patients. A Phase 1 study tested three dose levels of venetoclax (200mg, 400mg 
and 800mg) in MCL patients with median 2 prior lines of therapy(71). No DLT was reported at 
any dose levels. During the first 3 months of therapy, there were no clinically relevant Grade 3-4 
non-hematological AEs. 7 patients had 29 Grade 3-4 hematological AEs including 1 febrile 
neutropenia, 4 neutropenia and 4 thrombocytopenia. Among 9 evaluable patients after 6 cycles, 5 
were in CR. 
Another Phase 1 trial of 22 patients with relapsed or refractory NHL treated with venetoclax, 
lenalidomide and obinutuzumab included 5 patients with FL and 1 with MZL(72). The study 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
24incorporated 4 dose-levels with different combinations of lenalidomide and venetoclax doses. 
Three doses of venetoclax were evaluated (400mg, 600mg and 800mg). Patients commenced 
venetoclax at full target dose without a safety ramp-up. No clinically relevant TLS was observed.   
One patient had a DLT - neutropenic fever at DL1 (venetoclax 400mg, lenalidomide 15mg), but 
with expansion of DL1 and from DL2-4, no further DLTs were seen. Hematologic Grade 3-4 AEs 
included neutropenia in 20 (91%), thrombocytopenia in 5 (23%) and anemia in 3 (14%) patients. 
DL4 (venetoclax 800mg, lenalidomide 20mg) was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose. 
4 of 5 patients with FL achieved responses (2 CR and 2PR) and the 1 MZL patient went into CR. 
An ongoing Phase 1 study in our branch utilizes a combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab 
with ibrutinib, prednisone and lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory NHL and early results were 
been presented at American Society of Hematology annual meeting in 2019(73). A total of 31 
patients were enrolled with 11 FL and 2 MZL. Median number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 3 (range, 
1-8) and 19 (70%) pts were refractory to last therapy. 1 DLT was reported – Grade 3 intracranial 
hemorrhage at DL1 of venetoclax (200mg). Patient was receiving comcomitant enoxaparin and 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. ≥G3 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia were reported in 16 (52%), 11 (35)% and 
6 (19%) patients. Recommended Phase 2 dose of venetoclax was 800mg. In 13 total evaluable 
patients with FL and MZL, responses were observed in 12 (92%) patients, with CR in 7 (54%). 
Phase 2 testing in FL and Phase 1 testing in MCL is currently ongoing. 
1.2.8 Scientific Rationale 
[IP_ADDRESS] Triplet Combination of Magrolimab, Obinutuzumab and Venetoclax 
The primary purpose of our study is to test the safety and efficacy of the triplet combination of 
magrolimab, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax.  The safety profile of venetoclax with obinutuzumab 
has already been established, and we will determine if adding magrolimab to this combination is 
safe and can further deepen clinical responses(69). The safety profile of magrolimab with 
rituximab has already been established, but no studies with obinutuzumab and magrolimab have 
been conducted(41). Both agents have a risk of infusional reactions, and the risk of neutropenia is 
higher with obinutuzumab than rituximab(74). These potential safety concerns, however, are likely 
manageable and direct comparisons of obinutuzumab with rituximab in both CLL and FL have 
suggested that it is more effective(74, 75). Further, we anticipate that the majority of patients with  
relapsed or refractory non Hodgkin Lymphoma would have already received rituximab as part of 
frontline therapy, and obinutuzumab has demonstrated clinical activity in patients who have 
relapsed after rituximab(76, 77).   
A unifying biologic feature of the indolent B-cell malignancies included in this protocol is the 
frequent overexpression of Bcl-2 through a variety of mechanisms. Up to 85% of cases of FL will 
be associated with a balanced translocation involving BCL2 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain 
promoter [t(14;18)]. It is widely appreciated that Bcl-[ADDRESS_892506] as negative regulators of 
Bcl-2(45, 46). Many cases of MCL overexpress Bcl-2 with a major mechanism being the 
amplification of chromosome 18q21(47). Although the mechanism is unknown, Bcl-[ADDRESS_892507] cases of MZL(49).  
As a Bcl-2 mimetic, venetoclax has established itself as an agent that can induce deep remissions 
when given in combination with other targeted agents or anti-CD20 agent as discussed in earlier 
sections(20, 78). Synergy may exist between anti-CD47 antibodies and venetoclax. Mateo et al. 
published initial report of caspase-independent cell death in CLL cells using immobilized 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/[ADDRESS_892508] CD47(79).  After 18 hours of CD47 ligation by [CONTACT_118520], features 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_661658]. Valentin et al. reported that in primary CLL cells, ex vivo treatment with SRF231 (anti-
CD47 antibody) in combination with rituximab not only induced phagocytosis, but also induced 
cell death of non-phagocytosed target tumor cells via a mechanism that is partially mediated by 
[CONTACT_661702] C(80). Based on these studies, combination of these two agents can induce cell-
death via two independent pathways. Moreover, venetoclax as an anti-apoptotic inhibitor has the 
potential to induce prophagocytic signals on tumor cells, leading to potential enhanced activity 
when combined with magrolimab and obinutuzumab. In a xenograft mouse model of B-cell 
lymphoma, SRF231 displayed profound antitumor activity and led to complete and durable tumor 
regression in combination with venetoclax.
Magrolimab with rituximab has already demonstrated clinical activity in relapsed/refractory FL 
with minimal toxicity. Moreover, venetoclax with rituximab has been effective in producing deep 
responses in both CLL and FL(20, 52). Obinutuzumab is a newer anti-CD20 antibody, and was 
derived by [CONTACT_27892] B Ly1 mouse antibody and subsequent glycoengineering.  
It has the following characteristics, compared to type I monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab: 
high-affinity binding to the CD20 antigen, lower complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity, 
higher direct cell death induction, higher antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and antibody-
dependent cellular phagocytosis(55, 81, 82). In head-to-head comparison studies, it has shown a 
higher response rate than rituximab in relapsed indolent NHL patients( 62). Additionally, its 
combination with venetoclax has been well-tolerated and effective in relapsed or refractory MCL, 
MZL, FL and CLL(70-73). Increased direct cell death induction and antibody dependent 
phagocytosis makes it the most rational anti-CD20 agent to combine with venetoclax and 
magrolimab. 
An important objective of this trial is to define the complete molecular remission rate after 
combination therapy with magrolimab, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax. Based on the ability of 
venetoclax to achieve MRD negativity when used in combination with other targeted agents, and 
the above discussed data on potential synergy between Bcl-2 inhibitor, anti-CD47 antibody and 
type II anti-CD20 antibody; we believe the next logical step is to combine these active agents. We 
hypothesize that the novel-novel triplet combination in this study will leverage the efficacy of 
these targeted agents in indolent B-cell malignancies and produce deep and durable remissions 
without the need for indefinite therapy. This combination will have additive, if not synergistic, 
effects and the anticipated toxicities will be manageable.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Dose Selection
We will be using fixed doses of magrolimab and obinutuzumab throughout this study as no 
significant dose-dependent increase in toxicity has been demonstrated with both of these agents.  
Magrolimab at 10, 20 and 30mg/kg dose was tested in combination with rituximab 375mg/m2 in 
relapsed and refractory NHL and had minimal toxicity. A priming dose of 1mg with maintenance 
doses of 30mg/kg showed ~100% CD47-receptor occupancy – this was the recommended phase 2 
dose and will be used in this study. Although rituximab was used in this study with magrolimab, 
both rituximab 375mg/m2 and obinutuzumab 1000mg have largely similar toxicity profiles as 
compared head-to-head in a Phase 2 study, with the exception of grade 3 or 4 infusion-related 
reactions (IRR) which were seen in 11% patients receiving obinutuzumab and 5% patients 
receiving rituximab(62). IRRs are most common and most severe with first infusion, and hence 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/[ADDRESS_892509] cycle. 
In indolent NHL, an apparent improvement in ORR has been observed for the higher doses versus 
lower doses of obinutuzumab. For patients receiving a loading dose of 1600 mg on Day 1, Day 8 
and Day 15 of Cycle 1 followed by [CONTACT_102052] 800mg (1600/800mg regimen) on Day 
1, Cycle 2 and  onwards, ORR was 55% (95%CI: 32-76) and 2 patients (9%) had a CR; whereas, 
for the 400/400mg regimen, ORR was 17% (95%CI: 4-41) and no patient had a CR( 58). A simpler 
fixed-dose regimen of 1000mg (D1, D8 and D15, C1; D1, C2 onwards) results in similar serum 
concentrations when compared with the 1600/800mg regimen, and will be used in this study(58). 
As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], venetoclax 800mg was the recommended phase 2 dose in 
combination with other targeted agents for indolent NHL patients.  This will be DL1 for eligible 
FL patients on this study( 71, 73). When used in combination with other agents, there is a trend 
towards higher incidence of neutropenia with higher dose levels of venetoclax(73). Therefore, a 
DL-1 of 600mg venetoclax will be available. 
In patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, venetoclax is approved at a dose of 400mg, and the 
same dose has been used in combination studies with obinutuzumab for CLL and MCL with a 
tolerable safety profile as discussed in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] (69-73). The dose of 400mg 
once daily will be used as  dose level 1 (DL1) for CLL and MCL patients on this protocol, with an 
available DL-1 of 200mg should DLT occur. Even though the 800mg dose has been utilized in 
prior studies with MZL, very few MZL patients were enrolled on these trials(71, 73). Considering 
limited safety data is available (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), DL1 will be 400mg and DL-1 200mg for 
MZL patients enrolled on this protocol. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Use of MRD to Guide Duration of Therapy in CLL
Eradication of MRD usually results in improved clinical outcomes in CLL independent of the 
choice of therapy. (83-85) Specifically, with venetoclax monotherapy, a comprehensive MRD 
analysis of the two large phase II trials in relapsed/refractory CLL patients showed peripheral 
blood MRD <10-4 by [CONTACT_434584] 26% of the 174 patients. (86) Among MRD-positive 
patients, 23% showed intermediate (≥10-4 to <10-2) MRD levels and 51% had high MRD (≥10-2). 
24-month PFS rates were 92.8%, 84.3%, and 63.2% for MRD <10-4, intermediate MRD, and high 
MRD patients (p<0.0001).
The rates of undetectable MRD (uMRD) increase substantially when venetoclax is combined with 
obinutuzumab. In a study, an optional debulking with bendamustine was followed by [CONTACT_661703]-guided maintenance treatment of venetoclax and obinutuzumab in patients with 
treatment-naïve or relapsed/refractory CLL. (87) After induction, 87% patients had uMRD, with 
the majority of patients completing maintenance treatment at the earliest possible time point due 
to conﬁrmed  uMRD. In the phase III CLL14 trial, a higher rate of undetectable MRD in peripheral 
blood (via ASO-PCR) less than 10-⁴, was observed in patients given venetoclax plus obinutuzumab 
than in patients given chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (76% vs 35%, p<0·0001). In a landmark 
analysis from last treatment exposure (ie, after 12 cycles) patients with undetectable MRD after 
the end of either treatment regimen had longer PFS compared with patients with low MRD or high 
MRD (HR 0·10, 95% CI 0·06–0·15, p<0.0001). In a post-hoc analysis, OS was also longer in 
patients who had undetectable MRD at the end of treatment (p<0.0001). (69, 88) Another phase II 
study used the same combination with a different treatment scheme: after 2 months of 
obinutuzumab, induction with 6 months of combined venetoclax and obinutuzumab followed by 
[CONTACT_110716]:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
276 additional months of venetoclax.(89) After that, patients who were at least in partial remission 
were randomly assigned to receive either maintenance treatment with [ADDRESS_892510]-guided (by [CONTACT_4133]) venetoclax maintenance. 
26/28 (92.9%) patients had uMRD after induction. Follow-up is ongoing for patients randomized 
to the two maintenance groups. Of note, there was 92.3% concordance between bone marrow and 
peripheral blood MRD results at end of induction. 
Based on these and other prospective studies, the [ADDRESS_892511] 
- six-color ﬂow cytometry, ASO PCR, or high-throughput sequencing using the ClonoSEQ assay. 
(90) Six-color peripheral blood ﬂow cytometry (i.e., CD19, CD20, CD5, CD43, CD79b, and 
CD81) is reliably sensitive down to a level of <1 CLL cell in [ZIP_CODE] leukocytes. (91) Given >10-[ADDRESS_892512] 6 cycles of triplet combination therapy to guide 
further duration of treatment. (88, 92, 93) See Section 3.1.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Molecular and Immunologic Profiling of Tumors  
A critical translational component of this trial will be the comprehensive assessment of molecular 
and immunologic correlates that predict response to magrolimab in tissue and peripheral blood.  
Accurate identification of patients most likely to respond to treatment will be paramount for the 
success of our precision medicine trial.  Similarly, the identification of both intrinsic and acquired 
resistance mechanisms to magrolimab will enhance further drug development. To reach these 
goals, we aim to study the molecular and immunologic correlates of response with a 
comprehensive molecular analysis of baseline biopsies. Further, the study design will utilize a 
“window of opportunity” in which patients will receive magrolimab and obinutuzumab for 2 cycles 
prior to the triplet combination. This study design will allow us to characterize predictive 
biomarkers from on-treatment tissue biopsies taken during the window and at disease progression.  
We will assess changes in RNA expression, clonal evolution and mechanisms of resistance.
The National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Center for Cancer Research (CCR) is uniquely positioned 
to execute the strong translational emphasis of this proposal.  The Staudt lab will perform 
comprehensive molecular characterization of the tumors at baseline on FFPE blocks, including 
whole-exome sequencing, transcriptome profiling, AffySNP6.0 and arrays for copy number 
abnormalities, and will explore emerging technologies such as single cell RNA sequencing.  Given 
the influence of cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to tumor behavior, we aim to study 
the molecular evolution of both the tumor and the TME during therapy(94).  Recent advances in 
genomic technologies enable the gene expression profiling at the single cell level, a distinct 
advantage over conventional GEP which cannot always distinguish tumor vs. non-tumor gene 
expression(95, 96).  Single-cell approaches allow identification of the evolution of rare populations 
of tumor cells, prone to distant spread or therapy resistance, as well as identification of TME cells 
that may be critical for the survival of the tumor and/or those immune populations that can be 
harnessed to attack the malignancy.  The NCI-CCR operates a single cell analysis core facility 
with expert staff headed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Michael Kelly within the CCR Genomics Core.  This facility can 
take purified viably frozen cells banked from patient biopsies and prepare them, using well-
validated 10X Genomics technology, for single-cell RNA sequencing.  This core is directly 
integrated with the NCI Sequencing core facility to provide high-quality, deep-sequencing of the 
single cell RNA-SEQ samples, as well as ‘first-pass’ data processing and analysis.  Data can then

28be transferred to scientists and bio-informaticians in the Staudt lab for further analysis of gene 
expression patterns and cellular population dynamics.
The TME within indolent lymphomas influences both response and resistance to targeted therapy.  
FL is a proliferation of malignant germinal center B-cells admixed with a varying proportion of 
nonmalignant immune cells such as T-cells, follicular dendritic cells and stromal cells.  FL tumor 
cells in nodes retain a substantial dependence with the nonmalignant cells and other stromal 
elements from the TME in a pattern described as “re-education”(97). Interactions of FL cells with 
dendritic cells and macrophages allow them to survive in the germinal center environment even in 
the absence of an attached antigen(98, 99).  Moreover, in some models of carcinogenesis, 
progression is associated with a macrophage phenotype switch with low IL-12 expression, high 
IL-10 expression, and low tumoricidal activity and promotion of tissue remodeling and 
angiogenesis( 100).  Increased number of lymphoma-associated macrophages has been associated 
with worsened OS in patients treated with chemotherapy, but in patients receiving rituximab with 
chemotherapy, it was associated with improved survival(101, 102).  Other studies have found no 
association of tumor-associated macrophages on prognosis(103).  Neoplastic follicles also contain 
T cells, primarily CD4+, with a higher CD4:CD8 ratio in low-grade (Grade 1-2) than in Grade 3 
FL(104).  Multiple studies have associated Treg and T FH cells with clinical outcomes, but the 
results are inconsistent with some studies finding high Treg or high CD8+ cell numbers to be 
associated with favorable prognosis, and others non-significant(105-107). 
These studies involved different patient populations and treatment regimens, and that may have 
contributed to discordant results. Moreover, most of these studies utilized immunohistochemistry 
for detecting the types of cells and the results are subject to difference between pathologists in 
interpreting the results.  The cell types initially believed to represent a single lineage are actually 
many distinct subsets with distinct functions.  Optical tissue imaging has revealed specialized 
localization of a few of these cellular subsets in FL such as lack of naïve B cells (mantle zone), 
presence of follicular dendritic cells in extranodal sites and absence of FDCs in diffuse areas of 
FL; and high prevalence of Tregs in follicular areas and absence in areas transformed to 
DLBCL(98, 104, 108).  The spatial arrangement of the TME in FL varies across patients and 
depends on the genetic aberrations within the tumor cells as well as dependence on external stimuli 
for survival, proliferation, and immune escape.  Conventional microscopy provides spatial 
information, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_661659] a very few markers.  Hence, visualization and 
quantification of cellular subsets defined by [CONTACT_661704].  In contrast, flow cytometry provides more robust phenotypic data, but no information 
about spatial distribution of the various cell subsets.  A combination of both these modalities would 
be ideal to study tumor microenvironment in indolent lymphomas.
In collaboration with [CONTACT_661749] N. Germain, in the Center for Advanced Tissue Imaging (CAT-
I), we have developed a lymphoma-specific antigen panel that can be assessed by a tissue imaging 
method called “histo-cytometry.” This strategy combines multiparameter 3D confocal imaging, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_661660], identification and 3D reconstruction of specific cells of 
interest, and graphical data display.  Histo-cytometry allows visualization, quantification, and

magrolimab depends on activation of innate immune system by [CONTACT_661707], and also activation of adaptive immunity by [CONTACT_661708]8+ T-cells(36, 37).  Patients will have tumor biopsies at baseline (if required, based 
on inadequate existing tissue), during the “window” treatment period with magrolimab and 
obinutuzumab, and at the time of progression.  Dense phenotypic and spatial data made available 
by [CONTACT_661709]-cytometry at these timepoints will enable us to better understand immunological 
correlates of response, and resistance to treatment with anti-CD47 antibody and obinutuzumab.  
The diverse mechanism of action of immune checkpoint inhibitors (including magrolimab) in 
modulating the tumor microenvironment requires a careful assessment of the end points, such as 
while using functional imaging (18FDG-PET).  Because the TME is responsible for a significant 
amount of 18FDG uptake, agents causing immune activation may also cause an initial increase in 
PET activity, similarly to effects of anti-PD1/anti-CTLA4 antibodies observed in solid 
tumors(110).  Histo-cytometry will also provide additional information to distinguish immune 
reaction from tumor progression.
[IP_ADDRESS] Use of Circulating Tumor DNA
Measurement of minimal residual disease (MRD) is not part of the standardized criteria for disease 
response or disease monitoring in indolent lymphomas, but many research applications are 
currently being developed. Multiple methods have been tested for detecting MRD in B-cell 
malignancies with limitations.  Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) can easily be performed on 
peripheral blood or bone marrow as a marker of MRD, but this method may not be sensitive enough 
in diseases that do not routinely circulate(111).   Even in CLL, where MFC reliably quantitates 
CLL cells to the level of 10-5, NGS-based approaches appear to have a lower limit of detection and 
can assess clonal evolution(112). 
The tumor-specific component of cell-free DNA, known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), is a 
highly sensitive and specific marker of all B-cell malignancies and is an emerging technology 
designed to overcome the fundamental limitations of response assessment based on imaging scans.  
A secondary objective of this trial is to utilize ctDNA as a marker of MRD and compare the results 
to the standard assessment of disease response and monitoring for disease recurrence after therapy 
stops.  Many patients who achieve a CR based on conventional criteria will have the persistence 
of MRD below the detection limit of imaging scans highlighting the need for more sensitive 
measures(113, 114).  As a measure of the depth of response, we will define the complete molecular 
remission rate after triplet combination therapy.  Further, we will analyze the predictive ability of 
ctDNA for predicting disease relapse when measured at pre-planned timepoints after therapy stops.
Various technologies exist for the detection and analysis of ctDNA.  Malignant B cells possess a 
unique DNA sequence that encodes its rearranged immunoglobulin variable, diversity, and joining 
(VDJ) genes.  Using universal primers in combination with next-generation sequencing (NGS), 
this unique VDJ sequence can be utilized as a quantitative biomarker of disease(114). This 
technique requires identification of rearrangements in tumor tissue (a clonotype), which can then 
be followed in peripheral blood. In a study comparing NGS-based method with RQ-PCR in MCL, 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
3049 out of 55 (89%) patients had a clonotype detected by [CONTACT_661710] 45 out of 55 (82%) by 
[CONTACT_64091]-PCR(115).  Clonotypes identified by [CONTACT_661711] 96% of the cases. NGS 
demonstrated at least the same level of sensitivity as RQ-PCR, without the need for patient-specific 
reagents.  Technologies have since evolved, and in a more recent study, tumor clonotypes were 
successfully detected at baseline and followed serially in 96% of patients with MCL(116). Of note, 
in all patients who had baseline formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue available, one or 
more clonotypes were detected. A linear association was demonstrated between baseline 
quantitative ctDNA levels and tumor burden as measured by [CONTACT_661712] 
(TMTV). More importantly, ctDNA was able to provide an early readout of sensitivity to therapy 
as decrease in levels as early as after 1 cycle of treatment with chemotherapy and targeted agents 
(EPOCH-R plus bortezomib) was shown to associated with improved PFS. The utility of this assay 
has also been preliminarily tested in FL( 117). In a randomized study of FL patients, a subset of 
patients had tumor and plasma samples available for analysis for VDJ sequences.  At least one 
tumor clonotype could be detected in 29 patients (85%) in the diagnostic tumor sample. ctDNA 
corresponding to the clonotypes were detected in 25/29 (86%) of the matched plasma samples. 
We will use a modern ctDNA platform that combines universal PCR primers for the variable-
diversity-joining (VDJ) region of the immunoglobulin receptor with next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) technologies (i.e., clonoSEQ)(118).  This ctDNA assay is highly tumor-specific and can 
be used as a method for disease detection at the molecular level in a variety of B-cell 
malignancies(115, 117, 119).  Since the clinical utility of achieving complete molecular remission 
is unknown, this will be an exploratory endpoint.  Lastly, we aim to study the utility in using 
ctDNA as an active surveillance tool after therapy has been completed to determine the kinetic 
relationship between ctDNA reappearance and clinical relapse.  These data could inform future 
studies that initiate intervention on the basis of molecular relapse.  Altogether, ctDNA will be used 
in this study as a non-invasive method to monitor tumor response kinetics during therapy, define 
the depth of response, and as a surveillance tool for early disease detection after therapy cessation.

protocol to study the clonal evolution in FL that enrolls patients with untreated FL who are 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
35appropriate for observation as well as those who require immediate treatment.  In addition, we 
participate in a locoregional consortium of eight academic institutions within the Mid-Atlantic 
region (Mid-Atlantic Lymphoma Research Consortium) that shares information regarding active 
clinical protocols and aims to enhance patient recruitment across the region. Our patients for this 
study will therefore consist of those from the FL clonal evolution study, referrals from outside 
physicians, and patient self-referrals.
This protocol may also be abstracted into a plain language announcement posted on NIH websites

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a non-randomized, open-label, four arm, single institution phase 1 study of magrolimab, 
obinutuzumab, and venetoclax for patients with relapsed/refractory indolent B-cell malignancies.  
The study involves a novel design that includes a treatment window with a doublet in order to 
maximize the potential for translational research as well as a safety period to assess the safety of 
the triplet combination of venetoclax added to magrolimab with obinutuzumab in different disease 
sub-types. 
Research biopsies of lymph nodes and/or bone marrow will be collected at baseline, during the 
window period treatment with magrolimab + obinutuzumab, and at the time of disease progression.
3.1.[ADDRESS_892525] 4 weeks (Cycle 1) of triplet combination therapy with magrolimab, obinutuzumab and 
venetoclax. Venetoclax will be administered at DL1 without a safety ramp-up (Figure 3). If ≥2 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
39patients experience DLT at DL1, up to 6 additional patients will be enrolled (Cohort 1, Arm 1) and 
treated at DL(-1) of venetoclax. Dose-finding will follow the rules mentioned in Table 8. 
Up to [ADDRESS_892526] 5 weeks of triplet combination therapy (Cycle 1). Venetoclax will be administered with a 
safety ramp-up to target dose (dose level 1) (Table 10, Figure 4 ). If ≥2 patients experience a DLT 
at DL1, up to 6 additional patients will be enrolled (Cohort 2, Arm 2) and treated at DL (-1) of 
venetoclax (Figure 3). Dose-finding will follow the rules mentioned in Table 8. 
No more than 2 patients can be in a DLT assessment period at any given time. If a DLT has 
occurred, only 1 patient can be in the respective DLT assessment period at a given time. Patients 
who withdraw before completing DLT assessment for reasons other than a DLT, will not be 
evaluable for assessment of DLT for dose review decisions, and will be replaced. 
After completion of the DLT evaluation as above, all patients will be treated with an additional 5, 
4-week cycles of triplet combination therapy (magrolimab and obinutuzumab and venetoclax). 
Final duration of therapy will be based on response to the first [ADDRESS_892527] by [CONTACT_113289] 6 cycles of triplet combination 
therapy will stop treatment but remain potentially eligible for an additional 6 cycles upon disease 
relapse provided that they still meet re-treatment criteria and the duration of CR is  6 months. 
Disease relapse is defined by [CONTACT_661714]. Additionally, for CLL patients, positive flow cytometry during follow-
up will be considered relapsed for re-treatment.  Reappearance of ctDNA is not considered disease 
relapse on this protocol. Patients who achieve a PR after 6 cycles of triplet combination therapy 
will be eligible for an immediate additional 6 cycles, and then will stop treatment.

403.1.2 Dose-Expansion Phase 
Once safety is confirmed, expansion cohorts (Cohorts 3 and 4 and Arms 3 and 4) will be enrolled 
to collect additional safety information as well as disease response (Figure 5). During the dose 
expansion portion of the study, all patients will receive magrolimab with obinutuzumab for 2 
cycles during the “window” period (i.e., Cycle -2 and Cycle -1) designed to assess for early clinical 
activity and correlates of response to magrolimab and obinutuzumab. The purpose of the window 
is to study the molecular and immunologic correlates of response to magrolimab-based therapy. It 
is not intended to provide complete information regarding the clinical activity of this doublet. 
After completing the window, venetoclax will be added with the dose determined from the dose-
finding cohorts as described above. Patients must fulfill the clinical and laboratory criteria 
mentioned in Table 9 below prior to addition of venetoclax. Patients with unequivocal PD during 
the treatment window who are tolerating therapy will be allowed to be moved immediately to the 
next phase (i.e., addition of venetoclax). After completion of Cycle 1, all patients will be treated 
with an additional five (5), 4-week cycles of triplet combination therapy (magrolimab and 
obinutuzumab and venetoclax). Final duration of therapy will be based on response to the first [ADDRESS_892528] by [CONTACT_113289] 6 
cycles of triplet therapy will stop treatment but remain potentially eligible for an additional 6 cycles 
upon disease relapse provided that they still meet re-treatment criteria and the duration of CR is  
6 months.  Disease relapse is defined by [CONTACT_661717]. Additionally, for CLL patients, positive flow cytometry during 
follow-up will be considered relapsed for re-treatment. Reappearance of ctDNA is not considered 
disease relapse on this protocol.  Patients who achieve a PR after 6 cycles of triplet combination 
therapy will be eligible to receive an additional 6 cycles and then will stop treatment.

Grade 3 fatigue with improvement to ≤ grade 2 within 7 days
Grade 3 infection that improves to ≤ grade 2 after initiation of antimicrobials
Grade 3 electrolyte disturbances that improve to ≤ grade 2 within 72 hours with 
appropriate medical management and are not associated with other clinically 
significant consequences.
Grade 3 magrolimab- or obinutuzumab-infusion reactions that resolve to ≤ grade 1 
within 24 hours.  NOTE:   In a patient, if it is not clear if the AE is an infusion-related 
reaction (IRR), the patient may be replaced.  
Other grade 3 laboratory abnormality that is asymptomatic and deemed by [CONTACT_661718] 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic AEs 
Grade 3 neutropenia not associated with clinical sequelae 
Grade 3 thrombocytopenia not associated with  grade 2 bleeding  
Grade 3 anemia that lasts less than 3 days and responds to blood transfusion.  NOTE:

3.1.5 Safety Ramp-Up of Venetoclax 
Patients with FL (Arms 1 and 3; Cohorts 1 and 3) will start venetoclax at target dose for that 
particular dose level. 
Intra-patient dose escalation of venetoclax will be performed with fixed doses of magrolimab and 
obinutuzumab for patients with MZL, MCL and CLL (Arms 2 and 4; Cohorts 2, 4, 5 and 6) during 
Cycle 1 (Table 10). If tolerated, venetoclax will be administered at the target dose level once daily 
for all subsequent cycles. 
NOTE: During safety ramp-up, an individual patient who experiences a DLT or toxicity that meets 
DLT criteria during dose expansion (serious toxicity) can have venetoclax dose reduced to the 
dose of venetoclax that was tolerated and continue treatment (Table 10), if felt to be in the best 
interests of the patient. Once DLT assessment is complete, all dose modifications during safety 
ramp-up will be conducted per Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3. DLT rules apply to all arms.

infusion monitoring is not required for doses after Cycle 1, Day 22 for Arms 1 and 2 (dose-finding 
arms), and Cycle -2, Day 22 for Arms 3 and 4 (dose expansion arms). Patients who experience any 
treatment-related AEs during the observation period should be further monitored, as clinically 
appropriate. 
Complete Blood Count with Differential will be performed prior to each dose, and 3-[ADDRESS_892534] and second doses of magrolimab - Cycle 1, Days 2 and 8 for dose-finding arms (Arms 1 and 
2), and Cycle -2, Days 2 and 8 for dose-escalation arms (Arms 3 and 4). Complete Blood Count with 
Differential will also be performed twice weekly for the first cycle (Cycle 1 for dose-finding arms 
[Arms 1 and 2], and Cycle -2 for dose-escalation arms [Arms 3 and 4]).
[IP_ADDRESS] Premedication for magrolimab
The optimal pretreatment regimen is defined as acetaminophen 650 mg (or a comparable non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory agent) and oral or IV diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg (or comparable 
regimen) for the priming dose and the first loading dose. Additional premedication with 
dexamethasone [ADDRESS_892535] 2 doses of magrolimab. 
Premedication is not required for subsequent doses unless the patient has experienced a prior grade 
3 infusion reaction; however, premedication for subsequent magrolimab treatments may be 
continued based on the treating physician’s clinical judgement and the presence/severity of prior 
infusion reactions. Intravenous corticosteroid (e.g., 100mg prednisone/prednisolone or 4 to 20mg 
dexamethasone or 80mg methylprednisolone) may be administered if a patient has experienced a 
prior grade 3 infusion reaction, or at investigator’s discretion.

493.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
The following sections detail dose modifications/delay guidelines for each individual drug of the 
window or triplet combination regimen based on documented toxicity. It is the responsibility of 
the investigator to determine the most likely agent responsible for the observed toxicity and follow 
dose modification/delay guidelines in the appropriate section listed below. Dose reductions or 
delay for multiple study agents based on the same toxicity is not necessary and dosing should be 
modified or delayed only for the most likely offending agent identified by [CONTACT_093].
Dose adjustments are to be made according to the system showing the greatest toxicity. If a patient 
experiences several toxicities and there are conflicting recommendations, the recommended dose 
adjustment that reduces the dose to the lowest level will be used. 
Dose modifications of magrolimab and obinutuzumab are not allowed throughout the study 
treatment, only dose delays can be considered per investigator’s discretion. If AEs occur that are 
related to either of these infusional agents, then dose delays of up to 2 weeks during the window 
period, and up to 4 weeks during the triplet therapy, are permitted until the investigator feels it is 
safe to resume. If, after the delay the investigator does not feel it is safe to re-initiate therapy with 
magrolimab or obinutuzumab, then the patient should be taken off study treatment.  
3.3.1 Exceptions to Dose Modifications/Delays during DLT Evaluation Windows
[IP_ADDRESS] During venetoclax dose-finding (addition of venetoclax to magrolimab and 
obinutuzumab)
Dose delays of magrolimab and obinutuzumab should be avoided during the DLT assessment (i.e., 
Cycle 1 of triplet combination therapy in Arms 1 and 2) to allow for identification of toxicities. If 
a patient experiences a DLT to triplet combination therapy, then all study therapy should be held 
for up to 2 weeks per the investigator. If DLT resolves and it is deemed safe to re-initiate therapy, 
then magrolimab and obinutuzumab should be re-started at the prior dose, and venetoclax should 
be re-started at one dose level lower. Dose levels for venetoclax dose modifications are mentioned 
in the table below (Table 15).

DL-[ADDRESS_892537] be done according to the guidelines below 
(Table 16). The investigator may judge a more conservative dose modification if appropriate.  
Therefore, if these guidelines are not followed, the rationale for other measures is to be 
documented in detail in the patient’s medical record. Use of growth factors (filgrastim, 
pegfilgrastim, etc.) and transfusion support is permitted per investigator’s discretion.

3.3.3 Modifications for Non-hematologic Toxicity (for all toxicities except as specified 
below)
Dose modifications for non-hematologic toxicities are outlined below (Table 17). The investigator 
may judge a more conservative dose modification appropriate; therefore, if these guidelines are 
not followed, the rationale for other measures is to be documented in detail in the patient’s medical 
record.

3.3.4 Infusion Reactions to Magrolimab 
Infusion-related reactions are defined by [CONTACT_26277] 5.0 under “Injury, poisoning 
and procedural complications” as follows: “a disorder characterized by [CONTACT_661719].” The time frame for infusion reaction 
assessment is the 24-hour period beginning from the start of the magrolimab infusion. Re-
challenge of patients has not resulted in worsening of any adverse reaction and patients who 
continue on therapy following an initial infusion reaction have tolerated subsequent treatments 
without incident. There have been no late hypersensitivity reactions. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Grade 1
For Grade 1 symptoms (mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention 
not indicated):
Monitor patient until recovery from symptoms.
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL

52Patients who experience IRRs with the first 2 doses of magrolimab should continue 
premedication with corticosteroids prior to subsequent doses at the Principal Investigator’s 
discretion.
[IP_ADDRESS] Grade 2
For Grade 2 IRR, described as requiring symptomatic treatment and prophylactic medications 
(e.g. antihistamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, IV fluids) 
for ≤ 24 hours, infusion interruption is indicated:
Stop the magrolimab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the patient 
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or 500 to 750 mg oral 
paracetamol/acetaminophen.
Monitor patient until resolution of symptoms.
Corticosteroid therapy may also be administered.
If the infusion is interrupted, wait until symptoms resolve, then restart the infusion at 50% 
of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve.
If no further complications ensue after 60 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of 
the original infusion rate. Monitor the patient closely.
If symptoms recur, then stop infusion and disconnect the patient from the infusion 
apparatus; no further magrolimab will be administered at that visit. 
Patients who experience IRR with the first 2 doses of magrolimab should continue 
premedication with corticosteroids prior to subsequent doses at the Principal Investigator’s 
discretion.
Patients who experience an infusion reaction of Grade [ADDRESS_892539]-infusion 
observation period that does not resolve during that time should be observed for 24 hours 
or until the adverse event resolves, with vital sign measurements every 4 hours and 
additional evaluations as medically indicated for the management of the adverse event.

Immediately discontinue infusion of magrolimab.
Begin an IV infusion of normal saline. Systemic steroids, bronchodilators and/or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_661663].
The patient should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms
will not recur.
Patients who have Grade [ADDRESS_892540] be given premedication prior to subsequent doses. 
In this setting, premedication with acetaminophen (650 mg PO), diphenhydramine (25-50 
mg PO or IV) and dexamethasone (4-20 mg IV), or a comparable regimen, is recommended 
for the subsequent 2 doses. Long-term premedication can be discontinued if clinically 
indicated, for example if the patient does not demonstrate further infusion reactions after 
multiple doses.

Version Date: 12/18/2023
53In patients who receive premedication and still experience a recurrent Grade 3 infusion 
reaction, or patients who experience a Grade 4 IRR at any time should be permanently 
discontinued from the study treatment. 
All patients with Grade 3 or greater infusion related reactions will be observed for an 
additional 24 hours or longer until the adverse event resolves, with vital sign measurements 
every 4 hours and additional evaluations as medically indicated for the management of the 
AE.
In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance of localized or 
generalized pruritus after Day 1 but within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment 
may be given (e.g., oral antihistamine or corticosteroids).
3.3.[ADDRESS_892541] frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving obinutuzumab 
were IRRs which occurred predominantly during infusion of the first 1000 mg. In patients with 
CLL who received the combined measures for prevention of IRRs (adequate corticosteroid, oral 
analgesic/anti-histamine, omission of antihypertensive medication), a decreased incidence of IRRs 
of all grades was observed. The rates of Grade 3-4 IRRs (which were based on a relatively small 
number of patients) were similar before and after mitigation measures were implemented. The 
incidence and severity of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially after the first [ADDRESS_892542] also been reported. IRRs may be clinically 
indistinguishable from IgE-mediated allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis). Patients with a high 
tumor burden and/or high circulating lymphocyte count in CLL [> 25 x 109/L] may be at increased 
risk of severe IRR. Rate modifications depending on the severity of IRRs are provided in the table 
below (Table 18).

Grade Intervention
Grade 1-2 
(mild and 
moderate)Reduce infusion rate and treat symptoms.
Upon resolution of symptoms, continue infusion.
If patient does not experience any IRR symptoms, infusion rate escalation may 
resume at the increments and intervals as appropriate for the treatment dose (see 
Table 13 and Table 14).
For CLL patients receiving the Cycle -2, Day 1 dose split over 2 days, the Day 1 
infusion rate may be increased back up to 25 mg/hr after 1 hour, but not increased 
further.
Grade 3 
(severe)Temporarily interrupt infusion and treat symptoms.
Upon resolution of symptoms, restart infusion at no more than half the previous rate 
(the rate being used at the time that the IRR occurred). If patient does not experience 
any further IRR symptoms, infusion rate escalation may resume at the increments 
and intervals as appropriate for the treatment dose (see Table 13 and Table 14:).
For CLL patients receiving the Cycle -2, Day 1 dose split over 2 days, the Day 1 
infusion rate may be increased back up to 25 mg/hr after 1 hour, but not increased 
further.
If the patient experiences a second occurrence of a Grade 3 IRR, stop infusion and 
permanently discontinue therapy.
Grade 4 
(life-threatening)Stop infusion and permanently discontinue therapy.
3.4 SAFETY MANAGEMENT G UIDELINES FOR OTHER COMMON TOXICITIES
Guidelines for management of other common anticipated toxicities from study medications will 
be discussed in this section. It is emphasized that these are general guidelines and may or may not 
be followed depending on the patient’s clinical situation and investigator’s judgement. Other 
supportive measures which the investigator deems appropriate for the clinical situation, may be 
utilized. Therefore, if other measures are used, it must be documented appropriately. 
3.4.1 Tumor Lysis Syndrome (Venetoclax and Obinutuzumab)
See Section 4.1.2
3.4.2 Magrolimab
[IP_ADDRESS] Anemia 
Treatment with a priming dose of 1 mg/kg followed by [CONTACT_661720], transient, acute decline in hemoglobin levels of about 2 g/dL, with nadirs 
occurring in most patients within the first [ADDRESS_892543] a 
documented hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL within [ADDRESS_892544] their hemoglobin rechecked to meet ≥ 9 g/dL prior to each of the first 2 doses of magrolimab. 
For patients after exposure to magrolimab, hemoglobin will be monitored frequently for response

Version Date: 12/18/2023
55and/or toxicity prior to each dose, and [ADDRESS_892545] matching for all the specified blood 
groups proves impractical (e.g., for MNS blood group), local sites will decide on the best matched 
donor units to be used. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) matching (i.e., CMV-seronegative units for 
CMV-seronegative patients) will not be required for this study because it will limit the inventory 
for antigen matching.  
If the crossmatch is incompatible, the RBC units that are Coombs crossmatch-incompatible will 
be selected (e.g., phenotype-matched or least incompatible) for issue at the discretion of the local 
site’s Transfusion Service Medical Director or equivalent person, where available. For emergency 
transfusions, the transfusion laboratory may consider using emergency Group O Rhesus negative 
units if phenotyped units are not available. Blood plasma therapy will be blood-type specific. 
Platelets will be blood type compatible whenever possible, and if not, will have been tested and 
found not to have high titer anti-A or anti-B. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pneumonitis
Pneumonitis has been infrequently observed in patients receiving magrolimab. Generally,
immune-related AEs have not been observed in clinical use with magrolimab. In contrast to
T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, magrolimab primarily exerts its antitumor efficacy through
macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells. Nonspecific T-cell or other host immune
responses that are seen with T-cell checkpoint inhibitors have not been observed with
magrolimab in nonclinical studies. Additionally, no events of macrophage activation syndrome
or hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis have been reported in clinical studies. In instances of 
suspected pneumonitis, first rule out noninflammatory causes (e.g. infections). If a
noninflammatory cause is identified, treat accordingly and continue therapy per protocol. Evaluate 
with imaging (e.g. chest x-ray or CT) and pulmonary consultation. Management of potential 
pneumonitis follows ASCO guidelines for immune-related AEs. Patients who experience Grade 3 
to 4 pneumonitis will be permanently discontinued from study treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Thromboembolic Events
Thromboembolic events, including deep vein thromboses and pulmonary embolisms, have been
reported in some patients receiving magrolimab, sometimes early in therapy. Available data for
magrolimab do not support a clear or consistent relationship between clinical thromboembolic 
events and magrolimab use. Patients should be closely monitored for the symptoms of
thromboembolic events and treated accordingly.
[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Neutropenia Prophylaxis
Severe neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were reported in patients treated with magrolimab in
combination with chemotherapy. Close monitoring of hematologic parameters including 
neutrophils is required for all patients treated with
magrolimab. For patients with high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_14478] 4 neutropenia and febrile
neutropenia, primary and secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF is highly recommended.
Prophylactic use of antimicrobials may be considered at the discretion of the treating physician. 
Management of neutropenia and dose modifications will be per Section 3.3.2.
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Infections
Patients (with or without neutropenia) should be regularly monitored for signs and symptoms of
infection. For patients with prolonged neutropenia or patients at risk, consider infection
prophylaxis including antibiotics (eg. fluoroquinolone) or antifungal agents (eg. oral triazoles or
parenteral echinocandin) in accordance with current guidelines.
For patients being treated for serious infections, hold the next dose of magrolimab until 
the infection has resolved clinically.
For serious infections that remain active for ≥ 14 days, consider discontinuation of 
magrolimab.
3.4.3 Obinutuzumab
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions with immediate (e.g., anaphylaxis) and delayed onset (e.g., serum 
sickness), have been reported in patients treated with obinutuzumab. If a hypersensitivity reaction 
is suspected during or after an infusion (e.g., symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_27804]), the infusion should be stopped, and treatment permanently 
discontinued. Patients with known hypersensitivity to obinutuzumab must not be treated. 
Hypersensitivity may be clinically difficult to distinguish from infusion related reactions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Worsening of Pre-existing Cardiac Conditions
In patients with underlying cardiac disease, arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation and 
tachyarrhythmia), angina pectoris, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction and heart 
failure have occurred when treated with obinutuzumab. These events may occur as part of an IRR 
and can be fatal. Therefore, patients with a history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely. 
In addition, these patients should be hydrated with caution in order to prevent a potential fluid 
overload.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatitis B Reactivation 
HBV reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death, can 
occur in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies including obinutuzumab. HBV screening 
should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with obinutuzumab. At minimum 
this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with other 
appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active Hepatitis B disease should not be 
treated with obinutuzumab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology should consult liver disease 
experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed following local medical 
standards to prevent hepatitis reactivation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)
PML has been reported in patients treated with obinutuzumab. The diagnosis of PML should be 
considered in any patient presenting with new-onset or changes to preexisting neurologic 
manifestations. The symptoms of PML are nonspecific and can vary depending on the affected 
region of the brain. Motor symptoms with corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_380619] (e.g., muscular weakness, 
paralysis, and sensory disturbances), sensory abnormalities, cerebellar symptoms, and visual field 
defects are common. Some signs/symptoms regarded as “cortical” (e.g., aphasia or visual-spatial 
disorientation) may occur. Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a 
neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture (cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_127832]). Therapy 
with obinutuzumab should be withheld during the investigation of potential PML and permanently

3.5 ON STUDY EVALUATIONS
Upon successful enrollment, and following completion of the Screening/Baseline visits, patients 
will begin treatment as outlined in Section 3.1. The results from all procedures/tests must be 
reviewed prior to initiation of each cycle of treatment for consideration of dose modifications.  
Treatment with magrolimab, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax will continue until discontinuation per 
study protocol (Section 3.1), disease progression, unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, or other 
reasons outlined in Section 3.9. Refer to the Study Calendar (Appendix G) for additional 
information for all tests and procedures to be performed prior to each visit and in follow-up. 
3.6 TREATMENT C ONSIDERATIONS /EXCEPTIONS
3.6.1 Treatment Beyond Progression (“Pseudo-progression”)
A minority of patients treated with immunotherapy such a magrolimab may derive clinical benefit

Version Date: 12/18/2023
583.7.2 Follow-Up Visits – Prior to Disease Progression
Patients who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move into 
the Follow-Up Phase and should be assessed approximately as follows:  every 3 months for two 
years after completion of study therapy, every 6 months for years 3-5, and then annually thereafter 
at the discretion of the investigator. Any other evaluations and tests should be performed as 
clinically indicated. After 5 years of monitoring without disease progression the decision to 
continue further surveillance imaging, including any assessments and procedures, will be left to 
the discretion of the investigator.  
3.7.3 Follow-Up Evaluations – Survival/Post Disease Progression 
Upon disease progression or initiation of other anti-cancer therapy, the subject moves into the 
survival follow-up phase and should be contact[CONTACT_185984] [ADDRESS_892550]; unless otherwise

4.1.1 Growth factors
The use of hematopoietic growth factors filgrastim and pegfilgrastim are allowed. 
4.1.2 Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)
[IP_ADDRESS] TLS and Venetoclax
TLS is a risk for patients with NHL who are treated with high cell-killing agents, including 
venetoclax.  Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management 
can occur as early as [ADDRESS_892556] 
for those with bulky disease, elevated leukocyte count, elevated pretreatment LDH levels, 
compromised renal function, and dehydration. We will perform tumor burden assessments, 
including radiographic evaluation (e.g., CT scan), assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, 
phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) in all patients and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to 
initiation of treatment with venetoclax. 
Patients with MCL and CLL are at higher risk of TLS than FL. The risk is highest during the first 
[ADDRESS_892557] venetoclax dose ramped-up over 
5 weeks. Also, we believe that use of magrolimab+obinutuzumab in the window period in our 
study may decrease bulk of disease in most of the patients resulting in reduced risk of TLS when 
venetoclax is commenced. 
The Cairo-Bishop Definition of TLS (clinical and laboratory) will be used in this study. See 
Appendix E for details. We will assess the risk for TLS based on clinical and radiological 
assessment (e.g., CT scan) prior to initiation of venetoclax treatment. For subjects at risk of TLS:
Guidelines for monitoring of clinical chemistries and administration of prophylaxis for the 
safety ramp-up period or period of risk are delineated in Table 19.  
Investigator may modify the management as s/he deems appropriate for patient’s clinical 
condition.

(Table 21) are met, the patient should be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_197753]. 
No additional venetoclax doses should be administered until resolution. 
-Availability of emergency dialysis should be ensured 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
63-Intravenous (IV) fluids should be initiated at a rate of at least 1 mL/kg/h rounded to the 
nearest 10 mL (target 150-200 mL/hr; < 50 mL/hr). Modification of fluid rate should also 
be considered for individuals with specific medical needs.
The management recommendations below focus on the minimum initial responses required. If a 
diagnosis of TLS is established, ongoing intensive monitoring and multidisciplinary management 
will be as per institutional protocols.
[IP_ADDRESS] For any occurrence of laboratory TLS:
-Withhold the next day’s venetoclax dose. If resolved within [ADDRESS_892566] dose, 
resume at the same dose.
-For any blood chemistry changes requiring more than 48 hours to resolve, resume at a 
reduced dose. 
-For any events of clinical TLS, resume at a reduced dose following resolution
In addition to the above, additional recommendations for patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma receiving first dose of venetoclax:
-For potassium increase ≥ 0.5 mmol/L from baseline, AND > 5.0 mmol/L, recheck 
potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium, and creatinine and follow guidelines per Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].1
-For phosphorus increase of > 0.5 mg/dL AND > 4.5 mg/dL, administer phosphate binder 
and recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium, and creatinine.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome from Obinutuzumab (Precautions During Cycle -2 of Dose-
Expansion)
TLS, including fatal TLS, has been reported with obinutuzumab. Patients with CLL or MCL who 
are treated with the combination of obinutuzumab and magrolimab are considered at risk of TLS 
if they have lymph nodes ≥ 5 cm or ALC ≥ 25 × 109/L, splenomegaly, renal dysfunction (Cr. Cl. 
< 70 mL/min) or baseline clinical chemistry abnormalities consistent with TLS as per Table 21. 
Patients during dose-finding portion of the study will commence obinutuzumab in combination 
with venetoclax, and the guidelines outlined in Section 4.1.[ADDRESS_892567] be treated and 
monitored as follows: 
Patients should receive IV or oral hydration (approximately 3 L per day recommended) 
starting [ADDRESS_892568] dose of obinutuzumab and should continue until and including 
D8 (approximately 3 L per day recommended).
Patients should be treated with uricostatics (such as allopurinol) or urate oxidase (such as 
rasburicase) as per label or local guidance. 
Patients should undergo laboratory assessments for TLS (uric acid, calcium, phosphate,  
potassium, and creatinine) and the results must be known on the same day the sample was 
taken.

4.1.3 Infectious prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Jiroveci
As mentioned in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.2, patients with MZL who received obinutuzumab based therapy 
had a higher rate of Grade 3-5 AEs compared to patients with FL, including a higher rate of 
infections. All adult subjects with MZL will receive prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Jiroveci during 
study therapy administration. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [ADDRESS_892569] treatments.
Prophylaxis will begin with initiation of treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1 of dose-finding or Cycle -2, 
Day 1 of dose expansion) and will be stopped upon completion of therapy unless continued 
administration beyond this point is deemed necessary based on inadequate immune reconstitution. 
The use of antibiotics and/or anti-viral prophylaxis according to institutional guidelines is also 
allowed.
4.2 PROHIBITED FOOD AND MEDICATIONS
Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_138701]: 
Any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_27819]/leukemia whether FDA approved 
or experimental (outside of this study)
Immunosuppressive therapy
Radiation therapy. NOTE: Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion may be 
allowed at the investigator’s discretion.
Steroid treatment with doses higher than 20 mg of prednisone or equivalent for prolonged 
duration is not allowed. Short term treatment with high dose steroids for non-neoplastic 
intent (e.g., COPD) is allowed.  If a patient is on chronic corticosteroid therapy, 
corticosteroids should be de-escalated to the maximum allowed dose after the patient has 
signed the IC. Patients may be using topi[INVESTIGATOR_124374].
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors around initiation of venetoclax as mentioned below in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].
Strong CYP3A inducers with venetoclax (Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Prohibited food:  Use of the following foods is prohibited for at least [ADDRESS_892570] been shown to inhibit CYP3A4, the major enzyme responsible for the 
metabolism of venetoclax. Consumption of these foods could lead to increased venetoclax 
exposure:
oGrapefruit 
oGrapefruit products 
oSeville oranges (included marmalade containing Seville oranges) 
oStar fruit
It is not possible to produce an exhaustive list of medications that fall into these categories, so if 
in question, refer to the appropriate product label.

[IP_ADDRESS] Venetoclax Use with CYP3A and P-gp Inhibitors
Concomitant use of venetoclax with moderate to strong CYP3A inhibitors during the ramp-up 
phase in MZL, MCL and CLL patients is contraindicated. Concomitant use of venetoclax with 
CYP3A inhibitors increases venetoclax exposure and may increase the risk for TLS at initiation 
and during ramp-up phase. For FL patients, moderate to strong CYP3A inhibitors are 
contraindicated for up to [ADDRESS_892571] be made to avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A or P-gp inhibitors. 
However, the inhibitor may be used if needed per investigator discretion, with dose modifications

not limited to characteristic B-cell markers including: CD10, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, 
CD23, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, CD79B, kappa and lambda light chain as well as various T-cell 
markers including: CD3, CD5, CD4 and CD8.
5.2.4 Tissue Samples
[IP_ADDRESS] Archival tissue
Archival block(s) or slides (i.e., at least 15 unstained slides, 5-microns) is required at baseline; 
these may also be required in follow-up in case of future routine procedures or in case additional 
tissue is needed even in the event of optional tumor biopsy.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph node excision or core needle biopsy 
Lymph node excision or core needle biopsy will be performed per routine standard of care, by 
[CONTACT_661724], as appropriate.  A procedure-specific consent 
form will be signed by [CONTACT_426423].  Every attempt will be made to perform 
excisional lymph node biopsies to obtain the best quality tissue for translational investigation.  
Consideration of alternative biopsy methods (e.g., core needle biopsy) will only be made if follow-
up excisional biopsy is not possible/safe or patient is unwilling to undergo repeat excisional lymph 
node biopsy.
In the event that a surgical biopsy procedure is performed, more than one lymph node and at more 
than one anatomic site may be collected, provided the additional procedures are not unacceptable 
risk to the patient.  In the event of core needle biopsy, these are obtained typi[INVESTIGATOR_426394] a 16-
18G needle at the discretion of the provider performing the procedure.  Conscious sedation may 
be used, if warranted, and the use and risks are acceptable to the patient. General anesthesia will 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
71not be performed to obtain biopsies for research purposes. The type of procedure to be done and 
manner in which it will proceed (e.g., excision/core, single vs. multiple sites of biopsy) will be 
discussed with the patient prior to the biopsy procedure; if CT guidance will be used for a research 
biopsy procedure, research radiation exposure will be discussed with the patient. Similar procedure 
may be followed for extranodal disease/masses. The patient will be reminded that all sampling for 
research is voluntary. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Sample handling/processing
When performed, excisions or core biopsies will be placed in sterile collection/core cylinder tubes 
(e.g., formalin); gently invert/inspect tubes with media 8-10 times immediately after collection to 
ensure the core(s) is completed immersed in the media.
Tissue samples will be handled/processed as below prior to planned analyses, as appropriate:
Any required routine review for histopathologic confirmation of diagnosis and/or grade 
will occur per standard of care (e.g., H&E, immunohistochemistry), if required.  
Formalin samples will be fixed and paraffin-embedded per routine techniques.  
5.2.5 Other Samples
[IP_ADDRESS] Germline DNA
Germline DNA will be collected by [CONTACT_41225], buccal swab, and/or saliva samples (preferred).  These 
will ideally be collected at baseline; however, may be collected at any point on study based on 
supplies.  Standardized, commercial collection kits or tubes will be used (e.g., 1, 5-10 mL K 2EDTA 
tube for blood; Isohelix SK-1 for buccal swabs; Salviette/Oragene® for saliva).  In the case of 
buccal swabs, two (2) samples may be collected in order to ensure adequate DNA collection.    
The samples will be processed and DNA extracted/isolated per kit instructions and established 
techniques.  These will be handled by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Figg’s lab (see Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_892576] information).
[IP_ADDRESS] Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (± flow cytometry) and core biopsy
Bone marrow collection will be performed per routine standard of care. A procedure-specific 
consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_426423]. Attempt will be made to collect 
both bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_170037]. If required, the procedure may be performed under 
conscious sedation per the discretion of the investigator. 
Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_661673] 
(e.g., heparinized tubes or containing EDTA/sodium heparin or formalin, as appropriate); 
gently invert tubes 8-10 times immediately after collection.  
Core biopsies will be placed in sterile collection/core cylinder tubes (e.g., formalin or no 
media); gently invert/inspect tubes with media 8-10 times immediately after collection to 
ensure the core(s) is completely immersed in the media.  
Studies to be performed on these samples include  cell analysis and histological (e.g., 
H&E), immunohistochemical (IHC)/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
review/testing, and other analyses per established techniques (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1, BCL2, 
MUM1, Ki67, etc.).

725.3 BIOMARKER AND RESEARCH METHODS
The technology platforms that are able to interrogate genomic structure and function are constantly 
in flux; therefore, the exact nature of the methodologies that will be employed will be assessed at 
the time that the samples are collected and ready for analysis. 
The following are technologies that are currently in use for each planned analysis:  
5.3.1 Tumor Profiling 
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, including FISH for BCL2 will be performed on every FL 
sample. For all patients with MCL, IGH-CCND1 will be performed. D6Z1/MYB, D12Z3/MDM2, 
D11Z1/ATM, D13S319/LAMP1 and TP53/D17Z1 will be done on every patient’s baseline CLL 
tumor biopsy, if available.  The routine IHC panel for diagnosis of indolent lymphomas will be 
performed on tumor tissue samples, including but not necessarily limited to CD3, CD5, CD10, 
CD20, CD21, CD23, BCL2, BCL6, MUM1 and MIB-1.
5.3.2 Microenvironment Tissue Profiling
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses will take to assess for contribution of the tumor 
microenvironment.  IHC that will be performed may include, but are not necessarily limited to:  
CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD45RO, CD57, CD68, FOXP3, Granzyme B, LAG3, PD-1/PD-L1 (H-
score), SIRP CD14, CD33, CD47, CD163 and/or CD206.
5.3.3 Immune Subset Analysis
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be assessed using multiparameter flow cytometry 
for immune subsets including but not necessarily limited to CD8+ T-cells, CD4+Foxp3- T-cells, 
Tregs, T ex, Th1, Th2 and Th17+ CD4+ T-cells, monocyte subsets, macrophage subsets, and MDSC 
subsets. Assessment may include functional markers, i.e., PD-1, Tim-3, CTLA-4, PD-L1, HLA-
DR, Ki67, CD47, SIRP  and/or CD40.
5.3.4 Histo-cytometry/Multiplex Staining Technologies
Tissues samples will be provided to the laboratory of [CONTACT_661750] (NIAID/NIH) for 
recently developed multiplex staining technologies in 2D and 3D.  [CONTACT_661751]'s laboratory 
(NIAID/NIH) will return confocal images and quantitative analyses of these images in figure 
format for interpretation and analysis. [CONTACT_661751]'s group (NIAID/NIH) will not have direct 
access to the key that links sample identifiers with personally-identifiable information.
5.3.5 DNA/RNA Sequencing 
Genomic DNA and total RNA will be extracted from tumor samples using a Qiagen All-prep kit. 
For individual target genes that are recurrently mutated in indolent NHL, classical Sanger 
sequencing will be performed on PCR amplicons, using primers surrounding the known sites of 
mutation. To broadly assess mutations, next generation sequencing (e.g., on an Illumina HiSeq 
2000 platform) will be employed, using a paired end sequencing strategy of libraries constructed 
from tumor DNA. DNA will either be sequenced in its entirety from a whole genome library or 
will be first enriched for exonic sequences using the Agilent Sure Select system, aiming for 30X 
or 100X average coverage per base, respectively. The sequence fragments will be mapped back to 
the genome using the BWA algorithm. Of sequences overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a particular base pair in the 
genome, the percent mutant calls greater that 20% with a minimum of 25X coverage will be 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
73considered as an arbitrary threshold for single nucleotide variants (SNVs). SNVs that are not 
present in the matched normal sample will be considered candidate somatic mutations. 
A related technology, RNA-Seq, utilizes RNA from the tumor specimen to create a cDNA library 
for high-throughput sequencing. RNA-seq will be performed using Illumina kits followed by [CONTACT_5019]-
throughput sequencing on an Illumina HighSeq [ADDRESS_892577] advantage 
over conventional GEP which cannot always distinguish tumor vs non-tumor gene expression(95, 
96).  Single-cell approaches allow identification of the evolution of rare populations of resistant 
tumor cells, as well as identification of TME cells critical for the survival of the tumor. The Center 
for Cancer Research (CCR) has recently opened a single cell analysis core facility with expert staff 
headed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Michael Kelly within the CCR Genomics Core.  This facility has the ability to take 
purified viably frozen cells banked from patient biopsies and prepare them, using well-validated 
10X Genomics technology, for single-cell RNA sequencing.  This core is directly integrated with 
the NCI Sequencing core facility to provide high-quality, deep-sequencing of the single cell RNA-
SEQ samples, as well as ‘first-pass’ data processing and analysis.  Data will then be transferred to 
lymphoma researchers and bio-informaticians in the Staudt lab for further analysis of gene 
expression patterns and cellular population dynamics.
5.3.[ADDRESS_892578]. Ahlman, special research analyses/readings of standard 18F-FDG PETs 
collected per standard of care will be performed to evaluate metabolic tumor volume and total 
lesion glycolysis.  
5.3.7 DNA Copy Number Analysis 
Array comparative genomic hybridization (e.g., on Agilent 240K or Affy SNP 6.0 microarrays) 
will be used to assess DNA copy number alterations as described, in tumor DNA to yield 
somatically acquired regions of copy number gain and loss.
5.3.8 Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) Analysis
Validated assays will be used to measure magrolimab serum concentration and presence of anti-
magrolimab antibodies. Coded (linked) samples (Section 5.4.2) will be sent to a contracted 
laboratory at the request of [COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. for analysis of magrolimab pharmacokinetics and 
presence of anti-magrolimab antibodies:  [COMPANY_003] Laboratories. 
[COMPANY_003] will run validated assays to measure magrolimab serum concentration and presence of anti-
magrolimab antibodies. See Appendix F for additional details.

5.3.9 Other Analyses
Other analyses include the following:
Cell analysis and histological (e.g., H&E), immunohistochemical review and analysis per 
standard and established research techniques (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1 expression [Dako], FISH 
for 9p24 amplicon, and other IHC analyses in blood and tissue).
Cytokine analysis (e.g., IL-6, IL-10, interferon beta, TNF-alpha)
cfDNA/ctDNA for liquid genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_25415] a non-invasive dynamic monitoring of disease as 
well as monitoring for individual molecular aberrations that herald progression or disease 
transformation; specifically, amplification and sequencing of the VDJ segment of the 
immunoglobulin receptor is planned
5.3.10 Future Use
Any blood, tissue, or other (e.g., CSF) products or portions leftover from other analyses will be 
stored for future research.   
5.4 SAMPLE STORAGE, TRACKING AND DISPOSITION
5.4.1 General
Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system.  
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed.  Samples 
will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if required.
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol. Any specimens that are 
remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored in the conditions described below.  The 
study will remain open so long as sample or data analysis continues.  Samples from consenting 
patients will be stored until they are no longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent 
for their continued use, at which time they will be destroyed. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_661676] a deviation. Reporting will be per the requirements of 
Section  7.2. 
If the patient withdraws consent his/her data will be excluded from future distributions, but data 
that have already been distributed for approved research use will not be able to be retrieved.
5.4.2 Clinical Pharmacology Program (Figg Lab)
[IP_ADDRESS] Sample Data Collection
All samples sent to the Blood Processing Core (BPC) of the Clinical Pharmacology Program under 
the direction of [CONTACT_62583] will be barcoded, with data entered and stored in the Labmatrix utilized 
by [CONTACT_74908]. This is a secure program, with access to Labmatrix limited to defined Figg lab 
personnel, who are issued individual user accounts. Installation of Labmatrix is limited to 
computers specified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Figg. These computers all have a password restricted login screen. All 
Figg lab personnel with access to patient information annually complete the NIH online Protection 
of Human Subjects course. 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
75Labmatrix creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to patients without Labmatrix access. The data recorded for each sample includes the patient 
ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, as well 
as box and freezer location. Patient demographics associated with the clinical center patient 
number are provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated with the processing 
method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.).
[IP_ADDRESS] Sample Storage 
Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezers at appropriate temperatures 
(e.g., -20ºC to -80ºC) according to stability requirements.  These freezers are located onsite in the 
BPC and offsite at NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the 
laboratory are required to be accompanied by [CONTACT_79922]. 
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a 
researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix. All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research 
purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused samples 
must be returned to the BPC. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_195108] a manner consistent with IRB approval.
Sample barcodes are linked to patient demographics and limited clinical information. This 
information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via registered use of the 
Labmatrix. It is critical that the sample remains linked to patient information such as race, age, 
dates of diagnosis and death, and histological information about the tumor, in order to correlate 
genotype with these variables.
5.4.3 Hematopathology Section of Laboratory of Pathology (Tissue samples)
Archival and/or freshly collected and processed tumor tissue may be stored in the 
Hematopathology Section of Laboratory of Pathology until ready for planned and/or future 
research assays if the patient has agreed to allowing specimens to be used in future research studies.  
IRB approval will be obtained before using any samples to conduct studies that are not described 
within this protocol.  Samples will be stored under conditions appropriate to the type of sample 
and processing (e.g., ambient or frozen).  
Tissue that is given to the technician will be assigned an accession number (HP#) in the HP Case 
Log book; sample tracking also takes place with a FileMaker Pro data base called HP Patient 
Information and Specimen Inventory.   A Patient background sheet may be filled out and filed with 
any accompanying paperwork, with final reports and any supplemental reports that follow added 
as completed. 
5.4.4 Staudt Lab
[IP_ADDRESS] Sample Data Collection
Patient samples, collected for research under this IRB approved protocol, may be archived in the 
Staudt laboratory.  All data associated with archived clinical research samples is entered into the 
web-based NCI Labmatrix database, a centralized system with access controlled via centralized 
login.  Access to this database for samples collected from this study is limited to [CONTACT_661752] and 
his research staff, each requiring individual login and password.  All staff in the laboratory receive 
annually updated NIH/CITI or other training, as appropriate, and maintain standards of computer 
security.  
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
76The data recorded for each sample may include the patient ID, trial name/protocol number, date 
drawn/collected, treatment cycle/time point, sample source (e.g., peripheral blood, marrow, tissue, 
etc.) as well as box and freezer location.  All received samples will be given a unique bar code 
number, which will be added to the sample NCI Labmatrix database.  Only this bar code will be 
recorded on the sample vial and the vials will not be traceable back to patients without authorized 
access to the NCI Labmatrix database.
[IP_ADDRESS] Sample Storage 
Samples are stored in freezers at -80°C (e.g., sera, plasma, tissue samples) or under liquid nitrogen 
(e.g., cells), according to established stability requirements.  These freezers are located onsite 
under the direction of [CONTACT_661752].  Access to samples from this protocol for research purposes will 
be as outlined in this protocol or by [CONTACT_79923] [INVESTIGATOR_13701].  
5.4.5 Nuclear Medicine/Tumor Imaging (Ahlman)
As [CONTACT_661753] is also a clinical nuclear medicine clinician reading the images also for standard 
of care, he will have access to identifiers of the subjects; however, his assessments specifically for 
the research metabolic tumor imaging analyses will not be recorded in the medical record, but only 
in the research records similar to other research-specific data and results.  
5.4.6 CAT-I Laboratory (Germain Lab)
The CAT-I laboratory (CAT-I) will obtain coded samples from [CONTACT_661754] and his staff.   
Upon sample acquisition, members of the CAT-I laboratory will enter these samples into 
CEREBRO, an advanced sample labeling system that tracks each sample through every step of the 
workflow.  To meet requirements for availability of primary data and for quality assurance checks, 
CAT-I will maintain a detailed inventory of the type (slide, tissue, frozen OCT block) and location 
of each sample in the laboratory.  More specifically, frozen OCT blocks and accompanying slides 
will be physically stored in the CAT- I laboratory.  Tissues provided will be fixed, frozen, and 
stored in the CAT-I’s -80°C freezer. The CAT-I laboratory will be locked when CAT-I lab 
members are not present.  Unprocessed samples will be held by [CONTACT_406806]-I or returned upon their 
request.  Finally, the CAT-I will comply with requirements for annual Biospecimen Reporting at 
the NIH.
5.5 SAMPLES FOR GENETIC/GENOMIC ANALYSIS
5.5.1 Description of the scope of genetic/genomic analysis
The research correlates for this study are expected to include DNA/RNA sequencing of tumors, 
including circulating tumor DNA.  In addition, whole exome sequencing may include evaluation 
for known lymphoma mutations.  For any genetic studies performed, the results will be deposited 
in a database such as dbGaP per NIH requirements.  Although there is controlled access to such a 
database, such a submission carries theoretical risks of revealing the identity of the subject.  This 
is discussed in the consent.
5.5.2 Description of how privacy and confidentiality of medical information/biological 
specimens will be maximized
Confidentiality for genetic samples will be maintained as described (Section 5.4).  In addition, a 
Certificate of Confidentiality has been obtained for this study.

*A score of [ADDRESS_892586] treatment, especially if at the time of an interim

inadequate response (to avoid under treatment). Measured dominant lesions: Up to [ADDRESS_892587] dominant nodes, nodal 
masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in 2 diameters. Nodes should preferably be from 
disparate regions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non-nodal 
lesions include those in solid organs (e.g., liver spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those 
noted on palpation. Nonmeasured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable 
disease should be considered not measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected 
as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as 
well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with 
measurement, including pleural effusions, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other 
lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_9661]. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (e.g., GI tract, liver, 
bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete metabolic response but should be no 
higher than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (e.g., with marrow activation as a result of chemotherapy of myeloid 
growth factors).

to lymphoma.
6.3.2 Response Criteria – CLL 
The response rate in CLL patients will be calculated based on iwCLL response criteria (Hallek et 
al 2018)(90):
Complete remission (CR)
Requires all  of the following criteria: 
Absolute lymphocyte count <4000/microL (4 × 109/L). 
No lymph nodes >1.5 cm in diameter. 
No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. 
No constitutional symptoms attributable to CLL.* 
Bone marrow recovery as demonstrated by [CONTACT_58846] >1500/microL (1.5 × 109/L), platelet count 
>100,000/microL (100 × 109/L), and hemoglobin concentration >11 g/dL (110 g/L) in the absence of 
transfusion or growth factor support. 
Bone marrow at least normocellular for age, without evidence for typi[INVESTIGATOR_661678].¶
CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi)
Fulfills all requirements for CR except has persistent neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia thought to be 
unrelated to the disease and likely related to drug toxicity. These patients must have a normal bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_661679].
Partial remission (PR)
At least two of these criteria must be documented: 
A decrease in the peripheral absolute lymphocyte count by [CONTACT_2669] 50% from the level prior to therapy. 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
82A reduction in previously enlarged nodes by [CONTACT_2669] 50% with no increase in the size of any single 
lymph node and no new enlarged lymph nodes. An increase of <25% in a lymph node <1.5 cm is not 
considered significant. 
A decrease in the size of the liver and/or spleen by [CONTACT_2669] 50%. 
One of the following hematologic parameters must be met in addition to two of the above criteria in order to 
qualify for a PR: 
Platelet count ≥100,000/microL (100 × 109/L) or at least 50% improvement over baseline (if this value 
was abnormally low at baseline). 
Hemoglobin concentration ≥11 g/dL (110 g/L) or 50% improvement over baseline (if this value was 
abnormally low at baseline) without red blood cell transfusions or erythropoietin support. 
If only one parameter was abnormal before therapy, only one needs to improve to achieve PR.
Nodular PR 
Persistent bone marrow nodules on bone marrow biopsy in patients achieving a CR or PR. Lymphoid aggregates 
should be evaluated with immunohistochemistry to determine whether they are comprised of CLL cells, 
lymphocytes other than CLL cells, or T cells. If nodules are not composed of CLL cells, a CR can be documented 
provided all other criteria are met.
Progressive disease (PD)Δ
At least one of these criteria must be documented: 
The appearance of a newly enlarged lymph node (>1.5 cm), splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or other organ 
infiltration. 
An increase of 50% or more in size of a previously involved site (e.g., lymph nodes, spleen, or liver) 
measuring ≥1.5 cm. 
An increase of 50% or more in the total circulating lymphocyte count with absolute lymphocyte count of 
5000/microL (5 × 109/L) or greater.◊
Richter's transformation documented by [CONTACT_661727]. 
Development of neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia attributable to CLL.§
Stable disease 
Patients who do not meet the criteria for a complete remission, partial remission, or progressive disease, have 
stable disease. Stable disease is therapeutically equivalent to a nonresponse (i.e., refractory disease).
For patients treated with a therapy for a defined treatment duration, response assessment should be performed at 
least two months after the completion of therapy. For those receiving continued therapi[INVESTIGATOR_661680] a maintenance phase, response assessment should be performed at least two months after achieving 
"maximum response" defined as a treatment phase where no additional improvement is seen during at least two 
months of therapy.
CLL: chronic lymphocytic leukemia; SLL: small lymphocytic lymphoma; ANC: absolute neutrophil count.
* These include ≥10% unintentional weight loss within the previous six months, fatigue that interferes with work 
or usual activities, fevers greater than 100.5°F (>38°C) for ≥2  weeks, or night sweats for >1 month.
¶ Assessment of residual CLL cells in the bone marrow for this purpose is not based on flow cytometry. 
Assessment for measurable residual disease (MRD, also called 'minimal residual disease') is reserved for clinical 
trials. Although bone marrow biopsy is required to confirm a CR, it is not always recommended in general 
practice as it may not impact management. If the above clinical and hematologic parameters are compatible with 
a CR and the clinician chooses not to perform a bone marrow biopsy, the documented response can be "partial 
remission."
Δ Transient increases in lymph node size may occur during treatment with novel inhibitors and should not be 
considered PD.
◊ For patients treated with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_661681] (e.g., kinase inhibitors), an increase in blood 
lymphocyte count, by [CONTACT_5071], does not uniformly indicate an increased tumor burden, but may reflect redistribution 
of leukemia cells from lymphoid tissues. In such cases, increased lymphocytosis alone is not a sign of treatment 
failure or progressive disease.
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
83§ Cytopenias cannot be used to determine disease progression during active therapy since they may be due to 
administered cytotoxic agents. Cytopenias that occur at least three months after the completion of therapy and are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_661728]. Specific values that define progression include a decrease in hemoglobin level by [CONTACT_726] 2 g/dL 
(20 g/L) or to less than 10 g/dL (100 g/L) or a decrease in platelet count by [CONTACT_726] 50% or to less than 
100,000/microL (100 × 109/L).
6.3.3 Response Criteria – Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma(121) 
Partial response: 50% or greater decrease in spleen size. A reduction in previously enlarged nodes 
(if present) by [CONTACT_2669] 50% with no increase in the size of any single lymph node and no new 
enlarged lymph nodes. An increase of <25% in a lymph node <1.[ADDRESS_892588] be met in 
order to qualify for a PR: 
• Platelet count ≥100,000/microL (100 × 109/L) or at least 50% improvement over baseline 
(if this value was abnormally low at baseline). 
• Hemoglobin concentration ≥12 g/dL (110 g/L) or 50% improvement over baseline (if this 
value was abnormally low at baseline) without red blood cell transfusions or erythropoietin 
support.
Complete response: Resolution of organomegaly, normalization of the blood counts (Hb>12 g/dL; 
platelets >100,000/uL and absolute neutrophil count > 1500 /uL and no evidence of circulating 
clonal B cells). No evidence or minor BM infiltration detected by [CONTACT_9064]. 
No response: Patients who do not meet the criteria for a complete remission, partial remission, or 
progressive disease, have stable disease. Stable disease is therapeutically equivalent to a 
nonresponse (i.e., refractory disease). 
Progressive disease: At least one of these criteria must be documented: 
The appearance of a newly enlarged lymph node (>1.5 cm), splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, 
or other organ infiltration. 
An increase of 50% or more in size of a previously involved site (e.g., lymph nodes, spleen, 
or liver) measuring ≥1.5 cm. 
Development of neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia attributable to SMZL. 
6.3.4 Response Criteria – MALT lymphoma of the ocular adnexa(122)
Partial Response: 50% or greater reduction in the maximum diameter of the lesion from its 
original tumor size on imaging (CT/MRI) or ophthalmologic evaluation. 
Complete Response: Complete resolution of the lesion on imaging (CT/MRI) or ophthalmologic 
evaluation.

Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. The outcome of all pregnancies 
occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_892600] dose of obinutuzumab or whichever 
is later should, if possible, be followed up and documented. Pregnant partners may be offered the 
opportunity to participate in an institutional pregnancy registry protocol (e.g., the NIH IRP 
pregnancy registry study) to provide data about the outcome of the pregnancy for safety 
reporting purposes.
8.7 REGULATORY R EPORTING FOR STUDIES C ONDUCTED UNDER CCR-S PONSORED IND
Following notification from the investigator, CCR, the IND sponsor, will report any suspected 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/[ADDRESS_892601] and 
the adverse event.  CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators 
to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND 
safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, 
in accordance to [ADDRESS_892602] annually in a summary format.
8.8 SPONSOR PROTOCOL DEVIATION REPORTING
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any noncompliance with the clinical trial Protocol, Manual of 
Operational Procedures (MOP) and other Sponsor approved study related documents, GCP, or 
protocol-specific procedural requirements on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support 
of the clinical trial.
It is the responsibility of the study Staff to document any protocol deviation identified by [CONTACT_311830] (PDTS) online application. 
The entries into the PDTS online application should be timely, complete, and maintained per CCR 
PDTS user requirements.
 In addition, any deviation to the protocol should be documented in the participant’s source records 
and reported to the reviewing IRB per their guidelines. OSRO required protocol deviation 
reporting is consistent with E6(R2) GCP: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1): 4.5 Compliance 
with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol deviations.
9 CLINICAL MONITORING 
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure:
that the rights of the participants are protected; 
that the study is implemented per the approved protocol, Good Clinical Practice and 
standard operating procedures; and 
the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained.  
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_83944] (OSRO) Sponsor and Regulatory Oversight Support (SROS) Services contractor. 
Clinical site monitoring activities will be based on OSRO standards, FDA Guidance E6(R2) Good 
Clinical Practice: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) March 2018, and applicable regulatory 
requirements.
Details of clinical site monitoring will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_62554]. CMPs will be protocol-specific, risk-based and tailored to address human 
subject protections and integrity of the study data. OSRO will determine the intensity and 
frequency of monitoring based on several factors, including study type, phase, risk, complexity, 
expected enrollment rate, and any unique attributes of the study and the site. The Sponsor will 
conduct a periodic review of the CMP to confirm the plan's continued appropriateness. A change 
to the protocol, significant or pervasive non-compliance with GCP, or the protocol may trigger 
CMP updates.

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS
10.1.1 Primary Endpoint
To determine the safety and tolerability of the triplet combination of venetoclax, 
magrolimab and obinutuzumab in relapsed and refractory indolent B-cell malignancies 
10.1.2 Secondary Endpoints
Overall response rate (ORR = CR+PR) after triplet combination therapy with magrolimab, 
obinutuzumab, and venetoclax 
Complete molecular remission rate (CMR) by [CONTACT_661730], 
obinutuzumab, and venetoclax (in CLL patients only)
Duration of response (DOR)
Event-free survival (EFS)
Progression-free survival (PFS) 
Overall survival (OS)
10.2 SAMPLE SIZE D ETERMINATION AND STATISTICAL PLAN
The primary endpoint of this trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of 
magrolimab and obinutuzumab with venetoclax. We will be assessing this endpoint by [CONTACT_2329] a 
venetoclax dose-finding scheme. During dose-finding, patients will receive magrolimab and 
obinutuzumab at fixed doses, and venetoclax will be administered at DL1. If required, dose de-
escalation of venetoclax will be explored. Patients will be enrolled in two cohorts for this 
evaluation: follicular lymphoma (FL) in Cohort 1, marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (MCL), and mantle cell lymphoma (CLL) in the Cohort 2. Unless dose de-
escalation is required, 6 total patients will be enrolled from Cohort 1 into Arm 1, and 6 total patients 
will be enrolled from Cohorts 2 into Arm 2. Both Cohorts 1 and 2 will include a single dose de-
escalation DL(-1) if needed. A maximum of 6 treated patients will be needed to complete the dose 
de-escalation scheme (if required) for Cohort 1, Arm 1, and a maximum of 6 treated patients will 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
92be needed to complete the dose de-escalation scheme (if required) for Cohort 2, Arm 2 (total 24 
patients).  
At the MTD of venetoclax, dose expansion cohorts will enroll patients to assess the secondary 
clinical response outcomes in a preliminary fashion. The dose expansion cohorts (Cohorts 3, 4, 5 
and 6), based on the results of dose-escalation in Cohorts 1 and 2, will open to accrue up to 18 
additional FL patients, 6 additional MZL patients, 12 additional MCL patients and 6 additional 
CLL patients.  These numbers were chosen based on the expected number of patients which could 
be accrued in two years after completion of the dose-finding phase. A total of 42 treated patients 
will be required to complete the dose expansion phase of the study.  
Based on these estimates, up to 24 patients may be required for venetoclax dose-finding. These, in 
addition to 42 total treated patients required to complete the dose expansion phase brings the total 
number of patients required to complete the study to 66. To allow for a small number of inevaluable 
patients and screen failures, the accrual ceiling will be set at 76 patients. It is expected that 3 to 4 
years may be required to complete accrual, including dose-finding and expansion cohorts. Patients 
enrolled in dose-finding cohorts who are treated at the same dose-level as the expansion cohorts 
may be analyzed together with the dose-expansion cohorts at the end of the study (Cohort 1 with 
Cohort 3, and Cohort 2 with Cohorts 4, 5 and 6, respectively). 
As mentioned earlier in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.2, recent reports indicate that MZL patients may be at a 
higher risk of infection-related AEs with fatal outcome when obinutuzumab was used in 
combination with chemotherapy. As an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], if ≥[ADDRESS_892604] 
20 patients are enrolled, 25% or more patients have been unable to complete therapy due to 
unacceptable toxicity or if at any point [ADDRESS_892605] one 
cycle of treatment (magrolimab+obinutuzumab) therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for response. (NOTE: Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression after receiving at least one cycle of magrolimab+obinutuzumab will also be considered 
evaluable.)
10.3.[ADDRESS_892606] had their disease re-

Version Date: 12/18/2023
93evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target disease response assessment.  The response 
assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.
10.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES
10.4.1 General Approach
Toxicity profile of the combination therapy will be reported, and important toxicities described. 
Response rates will be reported as percentage, and time-to-event outcomes will be reported using 
Kaplan-Meier curves.
10.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Endpoints
The type, number and frequency of DLTs to triplet combination therapy will be reported and 
described. 
10.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints
The type, number and frequency of DLTs to doublet combination therapy (during the ‘window’) 
will be reported and described. The ORR, and CR rate will be determined and reported from 
individual cohorts and histological diagnosis. CMR rate by [CONTACT_661731]. Responses 
will also be reported along with 95% confidence intervals, with waterfall plots, when appropriate. 
The duration of response (DOR; beginning at the date clinical response is first identified), 
progression free survival (PFS), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) will be 
estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves, along with 95% confidence intervals at the median when 
appropriate. 
10.4.4 Safety Analyses
The type, grade and frequency of toxicities will be reported. DLTs, MTD of venetoclax in 
combination with magrolimab and obinutuzumab; and SAEs will be reported as well.  
10.4.5 Baseline Descriptive Statistics
Baseline characteristic of all cohorts will be explained including demographics, prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_661682].
10.4.6 Planned Interim Analyses
No interim analyses are planned 
10.4.7 Sub-Group Analyses
None planned.
10.4.8 Tabulation of Individual Participant Data
None planned.
10.4.9 Exploratory Analyses
The following are the exploratory analyses planned:
Overall response rate (ORR) after doublet-combination therapy with magrolimab and 
obinutuzumab
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
94Complete molecular remission rate (CMR) by [CONTACT_661732]-combination therapy with magrolimab and obinutuzumab
Complete molecular remission rate (CMR) by [CONTACT_661733]-combination therapy with magrolimab, obinutuzumab and 
venetoclax
Lead time for ctDNA assay in detecting molecular relapse prior to clinical progression
Identify potential biomarkers and molecular correlates that are associated with response 
and/or resistance to the study treatment
Test immunogenicity of magrolimab and asses the effect of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic markers, efficacy, and safety of magrolimab.
The ORR and CMR rates will be determined and reported from individual cohorts and histological 
diagnosis. Responses will also be reported with waterfall plots, when appropriate. The exploratory 
objectives such as seeking to identify potential biomarkers and molecular correlates that are 
associated with response and/or resistance to the study treatment, will be assessed using descriptive 
statistics as well as non-parametric methods such as exact Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The analyses 
will be done without formal adjustment for multiple comparisons, but in the context of the number 
of tests performed.
Magrolimab PK data will be summarized using summary statistics (mean, median, range, standard 
deviation, etc.) at each time point. The overall rate of ADA occurrence and type of ADA (e.g., 
transient vs persistent) will be summarized for all patients. PK in ADA positive and negative 
patients will be tabulated at each timepoint. If relevant, the impact of ADA occurrence on efficacy 
and safety will be assessed through summary statistics.

9512.2 PARTICIPATION OF C HILDREN
Since safety data is not available for magrolimab in children, patients <[ADDRESS_892608] of the histologies of indolent lymphomas we are testing are 
rare in children. 
12.3 RISK /BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
12.3.[ADDRESS_892609] common (>10%) adverse reactions with magrolimab are anemia (43%), nausea (41%), 
fatigue (30%), constipation (39%), diarrhea (39%), infusion-related reactions (33%), headache 
(32%), dyspnea (30%), pyrexia (39%), cough (27%),  thrombocytopenia (25%), decreased appetite 
(25%), febrile neutropenia (25%), chills (23%), vomiting (23%), dizziness (20%), and 
hypokalemia (21%), and bilirubin increase (15%), and pneumonia (10%). Other common AEs 
with magrolimab include hemolysis (≥1% and <10%, SAR 1.2% serious), sepsis (≥1% and <10%, 
0.4% serious), and hypotension (≥10%, 0.2% serious). Common AEs with venetoclax-
obinutuzumab combination were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, infections, fatigue and 
nausea. Severe neutropenia may occur with magrolimab use. Grade 3 (absolute neutrophil count 
[ANC] 500 to <1000 cells/uL) and Grade 4 (ANC <500 cells/uL) have been reported. Additionally, 
fatal events of febrile neutropenia have been reported in patients treated with magrolimab. Close 
hematological monitoring will be performed for all patients during treatment (at least once a month 
while on therapy). In cases of neutropenia, consider antimicrobial prophylaxis and administration 
of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) if clinically appropriate. If febrile neutropenia 
occurs, administer antibiotics and antimycotics. Dose modifications/delays will be per Section 
3.3.2. 
Serious infections (Grades 3 or 4) have been reported in patients treated with magrolimab, 
including fatal events of pneumonia and sepsis. Patients will be regularly monitored for signs and 
symptoms of infection during monthly clinic visits while on therapy. For patients with prolonged 
neutropenia or patients at risk, infection prophylaxis using appropriate antibiotics will be 
considered in accordance with current guidelines. Dose modifications/delays will be per Section 
3.3.2.
TLS has been observed with venetoclax, but rigorous precautions, slow ramp-up of dose and early 
detection and treatment has improved the safety profile. Individually, both magrolimab (in FL) 
and venetoclax (in CLL, FL, MZL and MCL) have shown promising activity.
As noted in Section 3.2, premedication will be given to reduce the risk of AEs occurring.  Subjects 
will be monitored closely, and manufacturer recommendations for delaying and discontinuing 
study medications and initiating supportive therapy will be followed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Biopsy Risk
The risks associated with biopsies are pain and bleeding at the biopsy site. In order to minimize 
pain, conscious sedation or local anesthesia will be used. Rarely, there is a risk of infection at the 
sampling site. CT guidance may be used for biopsies.
[IP_ADDRESS] Conscious Sedation 
The common side effects of conscious sedation include drowsiness, delayed reflexes, hypotension, 
headache, and nausea. These are generally mild and last no more than a few hours.
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
9612.3.1.3 Bone Marrow Biopsy
Bone marrow biopsy is minimally invasive and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a very safe procedure. Usually, the 
hipbone is numbed with anesthesia. Using a needle, the solid and liquid portion of bone marrow 
is taken out. This procedure causes some pain. Very rarely, infection or bleeding may occur at the 
needle site.
[IP_ADDRESS]  Radiation Risk
The study will involve radiation from the following sources:
Up to [ADDRESS_892610] abdomen pelvis (1 during screening)
Up to 4 [18F]-FDG-PET/CT
Up to 2 CT-guided biopsies as referenced above 
Subjects in this study may be exposed to approximately 14.1 rem. This amount is more than would 
be expected from everyday background radiation. Being exposed to excess radiation can increase 
the risk of cancer. The risk of getting cancer from the radiation exposure in this study is 1.4 out of 
100 (1.4%) and of getting a fatal cancer is 0.7 out of 100 (0.7%). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Scans
The radiation risks of the FDG and CT scans are discussed above.  In addition to radiation risks, 
CT scans that employ contrast may cause allergic reactions, injection site reactions abdominal 
discomfort and fainting.  MRIs carry no radiation risks, but are contraindicated in participants with 
metal in their bodies. In patients that receive gadolinium contrast with MRIs, allergic reactions, 
injection site reactions and kidney damage may occur. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk related to blood sampling
Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting. 
Up to 6.4 tablespoons of blood may be collected at any day and up to 26.9 tablespoons may be 
collected within 8 weeks.

113APPENDIX B:  G UIDELINES FOR PREGNANCY AND NURSING 
Contraception
Magrolimab, venetoclax and/or obinutuzumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  
Furthermore, it is not known if magrolimab, venetoclax and/or obinutuzumab have transient 
adverse effects on the composition of sperm.   
Magrolimab is contraindicated in pregnancy. In an enhanced embryo-fetal prenatal and postnatal 
development study in a pregnant cynomolgus monkey, there was an increased incidence of 
stillbirths at the high dose, and morbidity and mortality in the offspring at the high dose (secondary 
to severe anemia). In the clinical development program, pregnant or active breastfeeding women 
were excluded from participation the clinical studies.
For this trial, male patients will be considered to be of non-reproductive potential if they have 
azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition).  
Female patients will be considered of non-reproductive potential if they are either: 
1. postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative 
medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women 
not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.); OR 
2. have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_176715]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening; OR 
3. have a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.
Female and male patients of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or 
impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for [ADDRESS_892626] dose of 
venetoclax, whichever is later, by [CONTACT_139649]:  
1. practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity; OR 
2. use (or have their partner use) contraception methods that result in a failure rate of <1% 
per year during heterosexual activity.  
With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant, men who are not surgically 
sterile must use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure 
rate of <1% per year. 
With a pregnant female partner, men must use a condom.
Acceptable methods of contraception are‡:
Single method 
Use of one of the following is acceptable:
intrauterine device (IUD)
vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner 
Abbreviated Title:  VENOM in R/R B-Cell NHL 
Version Date: 12/18/2023
114contraceptive rod implanted into the skin
Combination method 
Requires use of two of the following:
diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical cap/spermicide)
cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)  
contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only) 
male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)
hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870]-only 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive 
injection
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently 
employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_270334]/IRBs.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) 
and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an 
acceptable method of contraception for patients participating at sites in this country/region.
Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the 
study patients of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described 
above) from the day of study medication initiation, throughout the study period, and up to the time 
frames after the last dose of trial therapy as noted above.  If there is any question that a subject of 
childbearing potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that 
subject should not be entered into the study.
Use in Pregnancy
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on study treatment, the subject will immediately 
be removed from the study treatment.  The site will contact [CONTACT_658660]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome 
of the pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. and Genentech without delay, especially 
if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  
If a male subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed 
immediately and the pregnancy reported to [COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. and Genentech and followed as 
described above. 
Use in Nursing Women
It is unknown whether magrolimab is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are excreted in 
human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, 
patients who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment.

118APPENDIX E:  CAIRO-BISHOP DEFINITION FOR TLS
The Cairo-Bishop definition proposed in 2004 (Table 21), provided specific laboratory criteria for 
the diagnosis of TLS both at presentation and within seven days of treatment. It also incorporated 
a grading system to help delineate the degree of severity of TLS (Table 22). 
Table 21: Cairo-Bishop laboratory TLS definition 
Parameter Value Change from baseline
Uric acid ≥476 micromol/L (8 mg/dL) 25% increase
Potassium ≥6.0 mmol/L (or 6 mEq/L) 25% increase
Phosphorus ≥1.45 mmol/L (4.5 mg/dL) for adults 25% increase
Calcium ≤1.75 mmol/L (7 mg/dL) 25% increase
Laboratory TLS is defined as any two or more abnormal serum values, as mentioned in the above 
table (Table 21), present within three days before or seven days after instituting therapy in the 
setting of adequate hydration (with or without alkalization) and use of a hypouricemic agent.
Clinical TLS is defined as laboratory TLS plus one or more of the following that was not directly 
or probably attributable to a therapeutic agent: increased serum creatinine concentration (≥1.5 
times the upper limit of normal [ULN]), cardiac arrhythmia/sudden death, or a seizure.

Days 2 and 8 for dose-finding arms (Arms 1 and 2), and Cycle -2, Days 2 and 8 for dose-escalation arms (Arms 3 and 4). 
8 Chemistry panels include: Acute care, Hepatic, and Mineral and 24-hour urine creatinine clearance (if needed to measure CrCl).
9 Peripheral blood flow cytometry for diagnostic and staging purposes; repeat in follow-up to assess disease status and response.  See also Section 5 for 
flow cytometry to be collected also for research purposes.
10 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (± flow cytometry)/biopsy within 12 months prior to starting treatment, unless repeat at screening/baseline felt to be clinically 
indicated (see Section 2.2); repeat in follow-up to confirm response or progression only if bone marrow involvement is present at baseline.  
11 CT scans (preferred) of chest, abdomen and pelvis to be performed at each disease evaluation; may be adjusted to assess additional known sites of 
disease, as needed.  Scans are to be done after completion of window with magrolimab and obinutuzumab (i.e., after 2 cycles of treatment; up to 7 days 
prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 pre-dose); after Cycle 3, Cycle 6, and Cycle 9 (if applicable), up to 7 days prior to next cycle; after Cycle 12 (if applicable), 21-28

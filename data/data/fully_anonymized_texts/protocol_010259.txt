PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Title: RESET-VT 
 
Objective:  The goal of this trial is to test the impact of catheter -based renal 
sympathetic denervation (RSDN) as an adjunctive treatment for 
patients with either ischem ic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy 
undergoing catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT). 
The proposed study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized 
control trial. Patients undergoing VT ablation will be 
randomized to either VT ablation alone or VT  ablation + RSDN.  
 
 
Design: This study is a prospective, multicenter, single -blinded, 
randomized (1:1) control trial evaluating the effectiveness of 
RSDN in the prevention of recurrent VT in patients with 
ischemic or non -ischemic ventricular dysfunction who are 
undergoing catheter ablation for VT.  These patients will be 
randomized to a blation alone or ablation + RSDN . Subjects will 
only be eligible for this study if they are ≥ [ADDRESS_1076948] a history of structural heart disease (post -MI, dilated 
cardiomyopathy, sarcoid myopathy, hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, etc.), have an existing ICD and are planned for 
catheter-based VT ablation. In addition, eligible patients will 
have accessible renal vasculature (as determined by [CONTACT_783258]).  
 
 
The patient will be blinded to the results of randomization. Once 
randomized, study group subjects will undergo a strategy of 
catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation + VT ablation. 
Follow-up will be conducted in regular intervals over a 24 -
month period.

3 INTRODUCTION , RATIONALE  
 
Sudden cardiac death (SCD), defined as an unexpected death from a cardiac cause occurring 
within ≤ 1 hour of the onset of symptoms, accounts for 300,000 to 400,000 deaths in the United 
States annually, or 5.6% of annual mortality.1-[ADDRESS_1076954] commonly caused by [CONTACT_783259]-arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia (VT).  Several therapi[INVESTIGATOR_724421], including implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy (ICD), anti-arrhythmic 
drug therapy (AAD), and the use of catheter based ablation.  
 
Current guidelines recommend the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) as therapy 
to prevent SCD in patients who have survived a prior cardiac arrest due to unstable VT or who 
have had a previous epi[INVESTIGATOR_724422].[ADDRESS_1076955] demonstrated the 
efficacy of ICD therapy in preventing SCD.5,6  The MADIT II trial, a randomized trial of patients 
with prior myocardial infarction and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤30%, demonstrated a 31% 
reduction in the relative risk of death in the defibrillator group. 6 However, ICD therapy does not 
prevent VT, and a significant proportion of patients may still experience appropriate shocks. In 
the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) Trial, 60% of patients had ≥1 
appropriate ICD therapy for VT/VF during follow-up (31±13 months), and the first arrhythmia 
resulting in a shock during follow up was frequently identified as VT (63%). Unfortunately, 
these ICD shocks are associated with both a significant reduction in quality of life and increased 
Renal VT Version 1.[ADDRESS_1076956] ICD implantation 19% of patients demonstrated signs of post-traumatic stress 
disorder.7 In the MADIT II trial, patients who experienced VT/VF had an increased risk of death, 
with a hazard ratio of 2.5.[ADDRESS_1076957] on longevity.  
 
Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) are another therapy available for the prevention of VT, but 
unfortunately they have little effect on ventricular arrhythmia recurrence, and may increase 
mortality when used in high-risk patients. In the OPTIC trial, 412 patients who had an ICD 
implanted within 21 days for inducible or spontaneously occurring VT/VF were randomized to 
either amiodarone plus beta-blocker, sotalol alone, or beta -blocker alone. Although patients in 
the amiodarone plus beta blocker group were less likely to receive shocks (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 
0.14-0.52; P<.001), shocks still occurred in 10.3% of these patients. In addition, serious adverse 
effects associated with amiodarone resulted in study drug discontinuation in 18.2% of patients at 
1 year.8 
 
More recently, catheter ablation has emerged as a new option for the primary prevention of ICD 
shocks. Current guidelines recommend catheter ablation for symptomatic sustained 
monomorphic VT, including VT terminated by [CONTACT_60426], that recurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_783247]. In addition, ablation is indicated for control of VT storm refractory to 
drug therapy when there is a suspected trigger than can be targeted for ablation.9 The Substrate 
Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_783248] (SMASH-VT) 
randomized patients with a history of myocardial infarction who underwent defibrillator 
implantation for spontaneous VT or VF, to either defibrillator implantation alone or defibrillator 
implantation plus substrate-based catheter ablation. In patients who underwent defibrillator 
implantation alone 33% received ICD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (anti-tachycardia pacing or shocks), compared to 
12% in patients who received defibrillator implantation plus substrate-based catheter ablation 
(Hazard ratio in the ablation group, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.78, P=0.007).[ADDRESS_1076958] limitations as sole therapi[INVESTIGATOR_783249]. One adjunctive strategy under investigation is renal 
sympathetic denervation (RSDN). Recently, RSDN has been developed as a therapy to treat 
hypertension in patients resistant to anti-hypertensive drug therapy. In the Catheter-Based Renal 
Sympathetic Denervation for Resistant Hypertension: a multicentre safety and proof-of-principle 
cohort study, 45 patients with a mean office blood pressure of 177/101 mm Hg (SD 20/15), 
(mean 4.7 antihypertensive medications)  underwent renal sympathetic denervation with  
radiofrequency based catheter ablation. After the procedure, these patients experienced a mean 
decrease in office blood pressure of -27/-17 mm Hg at 12 months, as well as a 47% reduction in 
renal noradrenaline spi[INVESTIGATOR_11036].11 In the Renal Sympathetic Denervation in Patients with 
Treatment-Resistant Hypertension (Symplicity HTN-2) Trial, a multi-center prospective trial that 
Renal VT Version 1.3 November 2012   8 
 randomized 106 patients to RSDN or medical management, at 6 months, 84% of patients who 
underwent renal denervation had a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm  Hg or more, 
compared with 35% of controls (p<0·0001). 
 
RSDN is thought to decrease blood pressure by a number of mechanisms including its ability to 
favorably affect whole body norepi[INVESTIGATOR_724427]. 
Indeed, RSDN has been shown to reduce whole body norepi[INVESTIGATOR_724428] 42%, and 
efferent muscle sympathetic nerve activity by 66%.[ADDRESS_1076959] of RSDN for the treatment of recurrent 
appropriate ICD shocks; two patients with ICDs for scar-related VT and CHF underwent RSDN 
for therapy resistant electrical storm. [ADDRESS_1076960] procedure. 
 
Rationale for RESET- VT: 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_783250], AADs, and catheter-based ablation strategies, considerable challenges remain. The 
optimal method for the prevention of recurrent VT following catheter ablation remains unclear. 
RSDN may be an effective tool for preventing ventricular arrhythmias, and associated ICD 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], by [CONTACT_783260], catecholamine levels, and the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system and promoting ventricular remodelling. Although RSDN has been shown to 
reduce the recurrence of VT in a case report of [ADDRESS_1076961] of RSDN in the prevention of 
recurrent VT in patients following catheter ablation of VT with ischemic or non-ischemic 
ventricular dysfunction. This study will specifically evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
adjunctive RSDN in the prevention of ICD therapy in patients with ischemic or non-ischemic 
ventricular dysfunction who are to receive a catheter-based VT ablation.

6. Ability to understand the requirements of the study 
7. Willingness to adhere to study restrictions and comply with all post-         
procedural follow-up requirements 
 
 6.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
Clinical Exclusion Criteria:  
1) MI or CVA within 30 days 
2) Coronary Artery By[CONTACT_15725] (CABG) within 30 days of this procedure 
3) Known renovascular abnormalities that would preclude RSDN (eg, renal artery 
stenosis) 
4) GFR <30 ml/min (unless receiving dialysis) 
5) Life expectancy <1 year for any medical condition 
6) Any condition resulting in a contraindication to anticoagulation (e.g. GI bleeding) 
7) Inability to give informed consent 
8) Known pregnancy or positive 
 -HCG within 7 days of procedure. 
 
7. Sample Size Calculation: 
 
We generated our sample size using the following key assumptions: 
1. In patients receiving catheter ablation for VT alone, the estimated success rate 
(absence of ICD therapy) at 2 years is 65% 
2. In patients receiving RSDN in addition to VT ablation, we expect a 30% 
improvement such that the estimated 2 year success rate is 85% 
 
The power analysis revealed that a 30% improvement in therapy with RSDN would be detected 
with 83 patients per arm (80% power, 2-sided alpha error of 0.05). This would require an 
enrollment of a total of [ADDRESS_1076962] an ~10% loss to 
follow-up.  Accordingly, we will plan to enroll an additional ~10% of patients so as to have 
sufficient number of randomized patients: this would require [ADDRESS_1076963] 
10% of patients will have renal vasculature inappropriate for the RSDN procedure (these are 
patients that will be consented pre-procedure, but will screen out after renal angiography during 
the VT ablation procedure).  Accordingly, we will ultimately plan to include a total of 202 
patients: ~18 patients would screen out after renal angiography, and there would remain a total of 
92 patients randomized to each arm. 
 
This study is divided into two phases: a PI[INVESTIGATOR_783252] (to include 20 patients) followed by [CONTACT_724446] 182 patients to a total of 202 patients. The PI[INVESTIGATOR_783253] 2 sites: 
Homolka Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Prague, Czech Republic) and Mount Sinai Medical Center. An interim safety 
Renal VT Version 1.3 November 2012   12  
 analysis for the primary endpoint will be conducted when all patients in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_783252] (20 
subjects) have completed the 1-month follow up visit. 
 
 
8. Patient Enrollment and withdrawal: 
 
This will be a multicenter trial.  Patients meeting the study inclusion criteria will be identified in 
the outpatient or inpatient setting by [CONTACT_467789]’ primary or co-investigators.   
 
The study will typi[INVESTIGATOR_193307] (including the risks and benefits) during the initial clinic or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186].  Consent will typi[INVESTIGATOR_193308].  Alternatively, the patient will be 
allowed to take a copy of the consent form home to contemplate whether they would like to be 
enrolled in the study.  A sample consent form can be found in Appendix 1.  Only patients who 
voluntarily provide consent will be included in this study.  Consent will be obtained prior to 
undergoing the ablation procedure. Patients will be able to withdraw from the study at any point 
without compromising their medical care.   
 
Consent must be obtained before the VT ablation procedure.

PRE- AND ABLATION PROCEDURE  
 
9.1.1 PRE-PROCEDURE  
The following tests and procedures will occur before the ablation: 
 
 Recording of patient medical history (including details of  VT both clinical/ICD) 
 Recording medication history (including all AAD ever used, duration of use) 
 Obtain β-HCG in females of child bearing age the morning of the procedure as per usual clinical 
practice 
 Baseline assessment of arrhythmia burden and type: Office/inpatient records, ICD interrogation 
report 
 Baseline NIH stroke scale 
 If performed for any reason, collect any pre-procedural imaging: MRI/CT and Renal Ultrasounds 
within [ADDRESS_1076964] electrolyte panel, renal function, 
and brain natriuretic peptide levels. 
 Baseline Transthoracic Echocardiogram 
 Baseline blood pressure.  Proper blood pressure measurement technique is essential: i) patient 
should sit quietly in a chair with his/her back supported for 5 minutes before taking the 
measurement; ii) use of the correct cuff size with the air bladder encircling at least 80% of the 
arm (the adult large cuff for the majority of patients); iii) support the arm at heart level during the 
cuff measurement; iv) a minimum of [ADDRESS_1076965] 1 minute 
and the average of those readings should be taken to represent the patient’s blood pressure; v) the 
blood pressure should be measured 
 Consent must be obtained before the VT ablation procedure. 
 Randomization into one of two groups will be performed by [CONTACT_783261]. 
Study/Experimental Group :  These subjects will undergo catheter-based sympathetic 
renal denervation.  
Placebo Control Group : These subjects will receive no further intervention.. 
 
9.1.2 PRE-PROCEDURE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT 
After the ablation procedure, patients should receive either an antiplatelet agent (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], etc) or anticoagulant (warfarin, dabigatran, etc) for at least 1 week.  Further decisions 
regarding the peri-procedural management of other cardiovascular (including anti-coagulant and 
anti-thrombotic agents) and non-cardiovascular medications should be as per clinical practice – 
but every effort should be made to maximize beta-blocker therapy, ACEI/ARB, and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_724431].    
 
9.1.3 VT ABLATION PROCEDURAL DETAILS  
 Patients will be brought to the electrophysiology laboratory in a fasting state 
 General anesthesia/conscious sedation will be used according to operator preference 
 Patients will undergo electrophysiology study and VT ablation as per standard practice 
 Therapeutic anticoagulation will be administered with intravenous heparing with a target 
ACT of 300 seconds or greater.  
 
9.1.4 RENAL SYMPATHETIC ABLATION PROCEDURAL DETAILS  
 In patients randomized to receive RSDN, the procedure will be performed after the VT ablation 
on therapeutic anticoagulation with intravenous heparin.  
Renal VT Version 1.3 November 2012   15  
 
 Abdominal aortography will be performed to assess the renal arteries for the suitability of 
catheter-based renal denervation in all patients. For those patients in whom the angiogram 
demonstrates that the renal anatomy is inappropriate for the RSDN procedure (small renal 
arteries, extensive atherosclerosis, renal stenosis, etc), the patient will be excluded from the study 
as a screen failure. The patient’s baseline information will be collected but no further follow-up 
required (beyond assessing for any adverse events related to the procedure).  If the renal arteries 
are deemed suitable for RSDN, the patient will then undergo randomization. 
 Randomization will be done by [CONTACT_724449]-block randomization centrally and will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_3725]. Allocation concealment shall be maintained at all sites by [CONTACT_2224] a web-based central 
randomization scheme. The operating physician controlling the delivery of ablative energy will 
be aware of the outcome.  This approach has been selected to minimize (1) study bias and (2) 
placebo effect. The randomization schema will be blocked by [CONTACT_724450].   
 After confirmation of eligibility, an irrigated radiofrequency ablation catheter will be introduced 
sequentially into each renal artery.  
 The ablation catheter is placed within a long vascular sheath and advanced into the renal artery.  
The sheath is advanced over the catheter to engage the renal artery ostium and allow for contrast 
injection and visualization of the vessel during catheter manipulation.   
 After completion of the measurement, no more than six radiofrequency ablation lesions separated 
both longitudinally and rotationally (a ―spir al p attern‖, see figure) will be placed per renal artery.  
The power will be started at 10 W and titrated to a maximum 20 W, as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_783262] (goal 10% drop).  Each lesion should be between 30-120 seconds in duration (no 
more than 120 seconds per lesion).

 SAFETY 
        
We anticipate no significant increase in adverse events as compared to the VT ablation or 
renal angiography procedure. The local site primary investigator will oversee the safety of the 
study at his/her site.  All adverse events will be reported to the Data Coordinating Center 
(Mount Sinai School of Medicine). Adverse events will be monitored and tallied for each 50 
patients enrolled in the study (after the 20 patients enrolled during the PI[INVESTIGATOR_783252]), and 
presented to an independent Cardiologist (who will serve as the Data Safety Monitoring 
individual). All adverse events will be adjudicated as being either: 1) related to the renal 
denervation procedure; 2) related to the VT ablation procedure or 3) unrelated to either 
procedure . Because of the small size of this study, the DSMB will consist of one 
Cardiologist; the PI [INVESTIGATOR_783254].  However, recommendations are solely up to the discretion of the DSMB 
 
9.3.1 Interim and Futility Analyses 
 
An interim or futility analyses will be performed after completion of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_783255]: after the enrollment of 20 subjects (10 controls, 10 study group). This analysis will be 
presented to the DSMB, who has the authority to terminate the study prematurely if an 
increase in adverse events is encountered.  If the DSMB determines the trial should be 
stopped early either because of efficacy or safety concerns, or otherwise modified, the DSMB 
will prepare formal written recommendations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_724433]. Moreover, any 
pressing safety concerns that the DSMB identifies will be verbally communicated to the PI [CONTACT_371712], prior to written documentation. The trial will be terminated early if severe 
procedure-related adverse events occur in more than 15% of patients in the treatment arm. 
 
9.3.2 Clinical Events Committee 
 
A separate Clinical Events Committee (CEC) composed of [ADDRESS_1076971] VT ablation. These risks include:  
Common:    
            
 Discomfort at the site of vascular access 
 Groin hematoma 
 
  Uncommon:  
 
 Bleeding 
 Vascular injury 
 Thromboembolism, including renal infarction and peripheral atheroembolism. This risk is 
minimized considerably by [CONTACT_724453], as well as the use of a 
saline-irrigated ablation catheter. 
 Risks associated with sedatives/anesthesia. 
 Injury to adjacent structures (phrenic nerve, cardiac valves)  
 Vascular complications (including pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula requiring surgical 
intervention) 
 Radiation burns 
 Pneumonia and/or sepsis 
 Death  
 Discomfort in the throat region  
 Cardiac Perforation requiring drainage or surgery 
 Injury to adjacent structures (phrenic nerve, esophagus, lung, cardiac valves)  
 Congestive heart failure  
 Myocardial infarction 
 Radiation burns 
 
The potential additional risks of the RSDN procedure are anticipated to be uncommon but may include: 
 Renal artery dissection 
 Renal artery stenosis or occlusion  
 Renal dysfunction potentially needing hemodialysis  
 Thromboembolism, including renal infarction and peripheral atheroembolism. This risk is 
minimized considerably by [CONTACT_724453], as well as the use of a 
saline-irrigated ablation catheter. 
 
10.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT 
 
10.1 Study Data Collection and Processing 
The Case Report Form (CRF) is an integral part of the study and subsequent reports.  The 
CRF must be used to capture all study data recorded in the patient’s medical record.  The 
CRF must be kept current to reflect patient status during the course of the study.  Patients 
will be identified by a [ADDRESS_1076972] numbers (or other personal identifiers) 
for their own reference. All study-related documents (CRFs, source medical records, 
regulatory binder must be kept in a secure, locked environment with access limited to 
study personnel only. 
Renal VT Version 1.3 November 2012   19  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_724435]/her site: 1) adherence to the 
protocol; 2) verifying adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research; 
and 3) ensuring completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data entered in the CRF. 
Final CRFs in human readable format must be reviewed and verified for accuracy by [CONTACT_783263] [INVESTIGATOR_183418]-off.  A copy of the final CRF will remain at 
the investigator’s site at the completion of the study. 
 
The CRF numbering convention is as follows:  
 
_01_-_2_ _3__4_ A -B -A 
_01_: Site # must be 2 digits (use leading zero) --- (sites 01-10) 
 
_2_ _3__4_ : patient screening/enrollment # (001 – 500)—must be 3 digits  
 
A-B-A: Patient initials (if no middle initial, use dash)  
Total [ADDRESS_1076973] parties (for example in case of an audit performed by 
[CONTACT_12721]) provided the data are treated confidential and that the patient’s 
privacy is protected.   
 
10.3 Deviations from Protocol 
 
The investigator will not deviate from the protocol except in medical emergencies or in 
unforeseen, isolated instances where minor changes are made that will not increase the 
patient’s risk or affect the validity of the trial.  In medical emergencies, prior approval for 
protocol deviations will not be required, but the IRB/EC must be notified within five days 
of the incident.

11.0 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Renal VT Version 1.3 November 2012   20  
 11.1 Risk to subjects: Although it is unlikely, it is possible there may be loss of 
confidentially.  This is a typi[INVESTIGATOR_783256].  Stenosis, dissection, and 
groin complications are possible clinical risks however they are not anticipated risks in 
this trial. 
 
11.2 Potential Benefits to Subjects: After undergoing RSDN, patients may experience 
less epi[INVESTIGATOR_724437] a result of the expected reduction in whole 
body norepi[INVESTIGATOR_783257].  
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_1076975] responsibilities and will delegate other 
responsibilities to his staff at the Coordinating Center, the Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Together, the coordinating center will: 1) ensure adherence to the national and 
institutional regulations; 2) develop and distribute protocols and case report forms; 3) 
coordinate data organization; 4) perform statistical analyses. 
 
11.4 Maintaining Records (21 CFR 812. 140 (B)) 
 
The Coordinating center will maintain copi[INVESTIGATOR_106152], data, shipment of 
devices, adverse device effects and other records related to the clinical trial.   
 
11.[ADDRESS_1076976] (IRB) / Ethics Committee (EC) Information 
 
This protocol and the informed consent must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_3809]/EC where the trial is to be conducted before enrollment of patients.  
Changes to the protocol that may increase the risk or present new risks to the patient, or 
may adversely affect the validity of the trial, must be approved in writing by [CONTACT_1201]/EC 
before the change is made. 
 
The study site Principal Investigator(s) is responsible for submitting and obtaining initial 
and continuing review (at intervals not greater than once a year) of the trial by [CONTACT_162500]/EC. 
 
 
12.[ADDRESS_1076977] of 1996 
(HIPAA). Those regulations require a signed patient authorization informing the patient of the 
following:  
 
1. What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients. 
Renal VT Version 1.[ADDRESS_1076978] vital status (i.e. that the patient is alive) at the end 
of their scheduled registry period. 
  
In order to ensure patient confidentiality, all case report forms and patient information (CT / MRI, 
if reviewed), fluoroscopic and endoscopic images, ECGs) will be de-identified and replaced with 
a unique patient identifier.  Information will be stored in the office of the local study coordinator, 
which will be kept in a secure location. The research study coordinators, principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigators will be the only people with access to this data. All data will be stored 
without any patient information apart from the unique three digit patient identifier.  There will be 
a code sheet that will link the de-identified data back to the subjects. This will be encrypted and 
password-protected. One copy will be stored in the primary investigator’s computer, and another 
in the research coordinator’s computer.

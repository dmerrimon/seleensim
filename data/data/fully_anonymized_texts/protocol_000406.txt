A.  Specific Aims   
 
With the long -term goal  of reducing pulmonary morbidity following perioperative  transfusion , the objective of 
this proposal is to test the feasibility, safety, efficacy, and clinical impact of point -of-care washing  of allogeneic  
Leukocyte -Reduced (LR) Red Blood Cells (RBCs) .  Specifically, we will evaluate the impact of this intervention 
on intermediate mechanistic and physiologically -relevant markers of transfusion -related acute lung injury 
(TRALI) and transfusion -associated cir culatory overload (TACO).  To this end, we propose a multicenter, 
randomized, phase I/II clinical trial in adult cardiac surgery patients receiving LR-RBCs  on the day of surgery . 
TRALI and TACO are common and important causes of morbidity following cardiac surgery and are the leading 
causes of transfusion -related death in the US .[ADDRESS_661381] for 
non-RBC components (e.g. plasma/platelets), the lack of effective prevention interventions for RBC -
associated TRALI and TACO  represent critical knowledge gap s. In this context, the mechanisms  
underlying these RBC -associated complications remain poorly defined .  Increasingly, soluble biological 
response modifiers (BRMs) within the RBC storage solution are suggested to play an important role .2-[ADDRESS_661382] [e.g. neutral lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805],6,12 soluble CD40 ligand  
(sCD40L),3 chemokine (C -C motif) ligand (CCL5),13,14 RBC -derived microparticles (RBC -MPs),15-17 cell-free 
hemoglobin (CFH) 18-20] have been associated with acute transfusion reactions.  Accordingly, safe, efficacious, 
and logistically feasible interventions to reduce RBC -associated respi[INVESTIGATOR_511346].  
Washing blood products prior to transfusion has been shown to reduce inflammatory markers in pediatric 
cardiac surgery patients21 and improve survival in patients with acute leukemia22 However , widespread 
adoption of this practice has been  limited by  [CONTACT_511396] i n the blood bank prior to transfusion.8  Our preliminary data demonstrate 
that: A we can predict which patients will receive RBC transfusions, thereby [CONTACT_511397] a high -risk cohort, and B we can  effectively  remove BRMs from allogene ic LR -RBC units with a practical, 
point -of-care, Autotransfusion device .  Therefore, to demonstrate the safety, efficacy, feasibility and clinical 
impact of this approach, we propose the following specific aims and testable hypotheses.    
AIM 1:  To determine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of point -of-care RBC washing using the Continuous 
Autotransfusion System (CATS) in adult cardiac surgery patients receiving allogeneic LR -RBC transfusion . 
Aim 1a  - We hypothesize  that point -of-care washing of  allogeneic LR -RBCs will be feasible in the time -
sensitive environment of cardiac surgery with minimal or no protocol violations . 
Aim 1b  - We hypothesize  that when compared to standard -issue allogeneic LR -RBCs, washed allogeneic LR -
RBCs will be associated with a comparable rise in hemoglobin concentration  and will not be associated with 
evidence of increased hemolysis (CFH, haptoglobin) or acute kidney injury in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
Aim 1c  - We hypothesize  that RBC washing will reduce TRALI  (neutral lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], sCD40 L, CCL5) and TACO 
(RBC -MPs, CFH) related BRM s in the RBC unit  by [CONTACT_7809] 80%.  
AIM 2:   To demonstrate the extent to which point -of-care washing of allogeneic LR -RBCs impacts the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_511347] -issue all ogeneic LR -RBCs.  
Aim 2a  - We hypothesize  that RBC washing will reduce post -transfusion concentration s of validated lung 
injury -associated biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, vWF, ICAM -1, RAGE, SP-D, PAI-1) in the transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
 
7 | P a g e  
    Aim 2b  - We hypothesize  that RBC washing will mitigate adverse physiologic consequences of RBC 
transfusion that have been associated with TACO (elevated mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular 
resistance, and pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469]).  
Aim 2c - We hypothesize  that lower levels of putative BRMs (neutral lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], sCD40L, CCL5, RBC -MPs, CFH) 
in transfused RBC components (and in the RBC recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) will be associated reduced levels of lung injury 
biomarkers and an attenuated cardiopulmonary response to RB C transfusion.  
AIM 3:   To evaluate the impact of point -of-care washing of allogeneic LR -RBCs on recipi[INVESTIGATOR_511348].   
Aim 3 a: We hypothesize  that compared to standard -issue RBCs, point -of-care washed RBCs are associated 
with improved clinical outcomes (shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen supplementation, and ICU 
stay; improved oxygenation; and improved organ function).   
Our large and accessible at-risk population , established clinical trial infrastructure , and multidisciplinary 
experience/expertise in translational, patient -centered transfusion research  will assure this proposal’s success.  
B.  RESEARCH STRATEGY  
 
B1. SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Problem statement :  Transfusion -related pulmonary complications are the leading cause of serious transfusion -
related adverse events.  Transfusion -Related Acute Lung I njury ( TRALI ) remains the leading cause of 
transfusion -related death in the US  and a lthough  seemingly less appreciated, Transfusion -Associated 
Circulatory O verload ( TACO ) has been the second leading cause of transfusion -related death over the past [ADDRESS_661383] .  The majority of patients who develop TRALI will require intensive care unit ( ICU) 
admission and ventilator support , which  typi[INVESTIGATOR_31228] s from 3 to 10 days .23,24 Clinical evidence also notes that 
up to 21% of TACO cases are life -threatening  and associated with increase d length s of ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210].25-[ADDRESS_661384] dramatically reduced the incidence of plasma -
associated TRALI (e.g. male -only plasma donation ), no preventi on strateg ies exist for RBC -associated TRALI  
or TACO .  Indeed,  the lack of safe and feasible strategies that can mitigate risk of RBC -associated 
TRALI and TACO represent  critical knowledge gap s in transfusion medicine .   
TRALI  mechanisms :  Although TRALI and TACO share a similar clinical phenotype (pulmonary edema and 
hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448] ), each is the result of distinct pathophysiologic processes.2,4,5,26,[ADDRESS_661385] insult typi[INVESTIGATOR_511349] (e.g. 
surgery, trauma, or infection) and the second “hit” from  the infusion  of factors resid ing in the blood component.  
For high -plasma volume components (e.g. 
plasma, apheresis platelets ), this is most 
often the result of anti-leukocyte antibodies 
within the donor product reacting with 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_511350] .  In contrast, 
multiple lines of evidence suggest alternate 
mechanism s are at play with RBC -associated 
TRALI.2-4,6  Here , the second insult is 
general ly believed the infusion of soluble 
biologic response modifiers (BRMs)  residing 
in the RBC supernatant.  Evidence supporting 
this theory   
include: 1) identification of specific BRMs  
Figure 1.   Temporal changes in the concentration of soluble 
biologic mediators in RBC supernatant during storage.14  
 
8 | P a g e  
    which can generate a n acute inflammatory response [ e.g. bioactive lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]6,12, soluble CD40 ligand3, and CCL5  
(also known as RANTES)13,29,30 and RBC -MPs17,31,32]; 2) association of prolonged storage duration with 
adverse respi[INVESTIGATOR_195954] (BRMs accumulate during the storage process , Figure 1 )12,14,15,33,34; and 3) the 
potential for mitigating transfusion reactions by [CONTACT_511398].21,35-[ADDRESS_661386]/ feasibility .38  
TACO  mechanisms :  The primary mechanism  underlying TACO has historically been believed fluid 
overload .25,[ADDRESS_661387] recently shown 
the median (IQR) transfusion volume  in patients who develop TACO is only 3 (2-7) units.[ADDRESS_661388]  recently shown significant  differences in the blood pressure response to RBC transfusion as a 
function of storage duration.18  These responses  were strongly correlated with time-dependent increases in 
nitric oxide (NO) consumption as well as with increased concentrations of RBC -derived  microparticle s (RBC -
MPs) and cell free hemoglobin (CFH), both of which are known to scavenge NO .  As a potent microvascular 
vasodilating subst ance , NO has substantial influence on endothelial function and systemic vascular resistance 
(SVR) .  Indeed, the role of NO  scavenging , RBC -MPs, and CFH in endothelial dysfunction  and transfusion -
related complications has been increasingly described.  16,17,19,20,31, 44,453 In regards to TACO, a sudden increase 
in the SVR has the clear potential to  compromise left ventricular function  (particularly in transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_511351]) , resulting in elevated left atrial pressures and ultimately hydrostatic 
pulmonary edema (the hallmark of TACO).   Notably, recent evidence also suggests that the delivery of 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_511352] -mediated pathways (e.g., inhaled NO44,46 and haptoglobin47) can mitigate 
these adverse responses.  In further support of a potential role for RBC -MPs, C FH, and NO scavenging as a 
mechanism for adverse cardiopulmonary response to allogeneic RBC transfusion, it should also be noted that 
the primary adverse effect identified with hemoglobin (Hb) -based RBC substitutes is profound hypertension 
associated with nitric oxide scavenging.48-[ADDRESS_661389] line of evidence suggesting alternative TACO mechanisms , our own preliminary data failed to 
corre late central venous pressure (a measure of intravascular volume  status ) with post-transfusion hypoxemia 
in closely monitored , mechanically ventilated patients , receiving sin gle unit RBC transfusion. In contrast , an 
acute  increase in SVR was associated with worsening gas exchange after RBC transfusion (Figure 2 ).

transfusion increase in central venous 
pressure (CVP) and systemic vascular 
resistance (SVR) in worsening gas

was associated with worsening gas 
exchange (left) while CVP increase had no 
effect on oxygenation (right)

    Finally , Blumberg et al.  recently evaluat ed temporal changes in transfusion outcomes and identified a reduced 
rate of cardiopulmonary complications (including TACO) with implementation of universal leukoreduction.52  
More  importantly , the investigation noted a complete absence of reported TRALI and/or TACO cases 
associated with  washed allogeneic  RBCs (n = 28,120  RBC units).  Again, t hese findings  suggest 
alternative TACO mechanisms and further imply that these mechanisms may be modifiable with  RBC washing.  
Transfusion -related complications  following  cardiac surgery:   Cardiac surgery is a high -risk endeavor under the 
best of circumstances.  In addition to this baseline risk, m ultiple studies have associated RBC t ransfusion with 
increased risk of adverse events in this population.53-[ADDRESS_661391] that p atients who undergo cardiac surgery receive a substantial proportion of the greater than 15,000,000

Point -of-care washing of allogeneic RBCs for the prevention of RBC -associated  respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517]:   
Standard issue, 120 -micrometer transfusion set filters  
permit the transfusion of cellular debris, microparticles 
and soluble mediators present in  the supernatant of an 
RBC unit.62  RBC washing can remove soluble 
contaminants in the RBC supernatant including 
chemokines, biologically active lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], cellular 
debris/microaggregates and possibly microparticles.7-[ADDRESS_661392] solution .  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_511354], the Cobe  2991 Cell 
Processor (Terumo BCT, Denver, CO), is an example of 
a device designed to remove all traces of plasma, 
essential for IgA -deficient  RBC  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 63 Importantly, 
such agg ressive washing may damage RBCs.  Indeed, 
this is  illustrated in Figure 3  [adapted from O’Leary et 
al.63] where progressive hemolysis of the resuspended, 
washed RBCs occur red in the post -wash storage period.   
Notably, p ost-wash hemolysis appears to be attenuated 
when using cell-salvage devices.  To this point, p otassium  release is a marker of hemolysis and  has been 
proposed as a washed product quality marker.64 Recently, O’Leary et al . demonstrated reduced hemolysis 
when comparing the Continuo us AutoTransfusion System (CATS;  Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homberg, [LOCATION_013]) to 
the C obe [ADDRESS_661393] blood bank RBC washing procedure s (typi[INVESTIGATOR_213263] 1 hour).8 This time requirement precludes the feasible implementation of “on -demand” RBC 
washing in time-sensitive environments such as the operating room and ICU.  Moreover, RBC wash ed units 
have a [ADDRESS_661394] cardiac surgery practices.  If washing of allogeneic RBCs using such a device prove s 
effective in mitigating RBC -associated respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517], all RBCs ( cell-salvaged and allogeneic) could  
quite feasibly  be washed with such a bedside device . 
Of note, c ell-salvage devices are also not identical. CATS is based on continuous cell separation with constant 
application of a low centrifugal force (330 -680g)6658 during separation or “skimming” of the red cells, where as 
the more typi[INVESTIGATOR_511355] -based cell separation devices employ an interrupted/discontinuous, higher 
centrifugal forc e (1220 -2000g).66,[ADDRESS_661395]  AABB -approved RBC washing 
procedures ( Cobe 2991 ).

    90% (a limit used for quality control in cell salvage) when washing allogeneic RBCs with the CATS device.8 
Summary on Significance:   In light of:  1) the impact of transfusion -related pulmonary  complications on patient -
important outcomes; 2) the lack of effective preventative strategies for RBC -associated TRALI and TACO; 3) 
the biologic plausibility for  the role of soluble BRMs in RBC -associated respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517]; and 4) the 
ability to remove these BRMs with point -of care RBC washing, we believe this proposal is highly significant.  
Furthermore, t his prop osal specifically addresses multiple highlighted topi[INVESTIGATOR_511356] o pportunity 
announcement  including : 1)  Non-infectious complications of blood transfusion including transfusion -related 
acute lung injury (TRALI); 2 )  Immunomodulatory, inflammatory and vasoregulatory properties of tr ansfused 
blood components; and 3 )  Evalu ation of the impact of introducing a new blood product preparation or 
transfusion strateg ies on transfusion -associated  adverse events and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ clinical outcomes .   
 
B2.  INNOVATION  
 
At present, there are no effective strategies that can mitigate the occurrence and/or impact of RBC -associated 
TRALI or TACO.  This proposal seeks to evaluate the novel repurposing of a cell -salvage device (CATS) in an 
effort to provide an innovative strat egy to prevent allogeneic RBC -associated pulmonary complications.  We 
will also evaluate novel mechanisms underlying TRALI and TACO.  While specifically focused on BRMs and 
their association with respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517] , our findings will more broadly diffe rentiate  the role of 
soluble BRMs (removed with washing ) versus  the role of the red blood cell itself ( not removed with  
RBC washing).   We believe this application is highly innovative for the following reasons.  
Testing the feasibility and efficacy of point -of-care allogeneic RBC washing:   Although washing of stored RBCs 
has shown promise in isolate d setting s (e.g. pediatric cardiac surgery21 and acute leukemia22), concerns 
related to feasibility have prevented larger scale testing of this novel approach to improving transfusion safety.  
Major limitation s with current RBC washing protocols include cost and the time requirement s (typi[INVESTIGATOR_511357] ).8  In time -sensitive environments such as cardiac surgery  or the ICU , this time delay is not 
feasible .  To address this  limitation, t his proposal takes an FDA -approved autotransfusion device (CATS) and 
proposes to repurpose it for point -of-care washing of allogeneic RBCs ; an approach that is clearly innovative .  
If both feasibility and efficacy are established, this would present a novel , feasible  and cost effective approach 
to improving transfusion safety .  Importantly, additional costly equipment would not be required as 
autotransfusion is standard of care for many surgical p opulations .  
There are no current strategies which mitigate the risk of RBC -associated TRALI or TACO :  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_511358]-important outcomes, no effective prevention strategies exist for RBC -associated TRALI or 
TACO.  Development of new  strateg ies that can mitigate  the onset and/or severity of these respi[INVESTIGATOR_511359] .  We propo sed to test a promising intervention, point -of-
care washing of allogeneic RBCs, in a  high-risk population undergoing cardiac surgery.  There is clear biologic 
plausibility for cause -effect relationship s between the infusion of soluble BRM s and development of these life -
threatening transfusion -related respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800].3,4,6,13,29,30 Moreover, recent evidence as well as our 
preliminary data  (see below) , suggest the washing procedures proposed in this application are effective at 
removing RBC supernatant  (and the BRMs contained within) .7-10 Therefore, we believe our proposed 
intervention provides an innovative, feasible approach to preventing RBC -associated  respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800].  
Evaluating new mechanisms for RBC -associated TRALI :  Though our understanding of the mechanisms 
underlying TRALI has  improved in recent years , these adva nces have been primarily limited to 
antibody/antigen interactions .2,68 Importantly , these specific epi[INVESTIGATOR_511360] -plasma 
containing blood component s (plasma , apheresis platelet concentrates, whole blood) .  In contrast, our current 
understanding of the processes underlying non -antibody mediated TRALI (the primary mechanism believed 
responsible following RBC  transfusion ) remain quite limited.  Indeed, the great preponderance of data in this 
regard has been generated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Christopher  Silliman, a consultant on this grant application.4-6,12,38 We 
believe our innovative approach ( evaluating the concentration of potentially putative BRMs in the donor unit,  
their change with RBC washing, the relationship between their concentration in the transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_847] 
 
11 | P a g e  
    intermediate markers of lung injury ) will provide essential new hypothesis -generating mechanistic insight s into 
the associations between RBC transfusion and po st-transfusion lung injury.    
Evaluating new mechanisms  for RBC -associated TACO :  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_511361] t o transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_511362], our understanding of the mechanisms  underlying this life -threatening syndrome 
remain incomplete.   
Although volume overload likely plays a key role in many cases of TACO, a growing body of evidence 
suggests the potential for alternate and potentially synergistic mechanisms that may present important 
opportunities for TACO mitigation.   Increasingly, evidence suggests a role for NO consumption, via RBC -
MPs16,[ADDRESS_661396] significant attempt to 
improve our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying TACO.  The targeted study of RBC -MPs and 
CFH in the RBC unit (as well as the transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]), and the evaluation of  their association with the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s physiologic response to transfusion, is novel and with high scientific merit.  
APPROACH  
 
We propose a multicenter,  phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the feasibility, safety , efficacy , and clinical impact 
of point -of-care washing for allogeneic  LR- RBC units in patients undergoing cardiac surgery .  Our group has 
demonstrated experience and expertise in the translational study of transfusion therapi[INVESTIGATOR_511363] -
important transfusion -related respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800].   We also have significant experience with the 
design and conduct of clinical trials.  Pertinent preliminary data are summarized here.  
Adequacy of the study population to ensure feasibility of the protocol:   Cardiac surgery remains a 
leading consumer of RBC component therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].11  At Mayo Clinic in [COMPANY_002]ster, MN, there were 2,344 unique 
patients who underwent cardiac surgery in 2011.  A total of 1,059 of these ( 45%) were transfused on the day of 
their surgical procedure with 310 patients receiving  4 or more units .  In the cohort of 10 ,653 patients 
undergoing CABG or CABG/valve surgery at Duke University Medical Center between 2000 and 2010 , 28% of 
patients receiv ed between [ADDRESS_661397] year , Duke University Medical Center 
performed 1 ,343 cardiac operations in total of which ~350 were isolated A ortic or Mitral Valve 
repair/replacement . The remaining 1 ,000 cases would  be of equivalent or greater risk of transfusion t han the 
CABG and CABG/valve cohort .  Therefore , at least 250 patients per year will be eligible for screening for this 
proposal.  Of note, approximately 75 % of allogeneic transfusions in this population are  administered on the day 
of the surgical procedure (based on our preliminary data 
from 2011).  
A prediction model for RBC requirement s in patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery70:  Utilizing  a 10-year study 
population of isolated CABG surgery  patients  at Duke 
University Medical Center (n = 5,887), our team (Co -PI: 
[INVESTIGATOR_511364])  developed a prediction model for estimating 
perioperative RBC requirements  in this setting.70 The model 
performed well with derivation a nd validation data set c -
indices of 0. 79 and 0.78 , respectively.   Applying this model 
in more complex cardiac surgery populations (combined 
CABG/valve, aortic repair/replacement, e tc.) suits our 
purposes well, as it  will likely  underestimate RBC needs for 
these more complex procedures. Enteri ng the predictive 
variables (see Table  1) into an on -line calculator tool, will 
enable screeners to enroll patient expected to receive 4 or 
more units  of allogeneic RBCs  into the proposed clinical trial . 
Clinical trial experience in transfusion  medicine and lung injury prevention71,72: Our team ( Co-PI: [INVESTIGATOR_511365] ; 
Co-I: Gajic ) has experience in the design and conduct of multicenter clinical trials evaluating t he impact of 
storage duration on  respi[INVESTIGATOR_511366] t o those targeted in this

    proposal . More specifically,  we recently completed a two-center (Mayo Clinic and the University of [LOCATION_004] -
San Francisco) randomized, double -blind clinical trial which compared fresh (< 5 days storage) to standard -
issue single -unit RBC transfusion in adult , intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.[ADDRESS_661398] -issue RBCs .  The primary outcome evaluated was the change in 
partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_511367] ( Δ PaO 2/FIO 2) with 
secondary outcomes evaluating changes in immunologic and coagulation status.  Although no signi ficant 
differences were noted in the endpoints evaluated (Table 2 ), the limited sample size, restriction to single unit 
RBC transfusion, and short duration of follow -up (median of 1.9 hours) were notable limitations with this 
investigation.

Using the multicenter, interdisciplinary infrastructure of the US Critical Illness and Injury Trials Group , our 
investigative team (Co-PIs: Kor , Welsby ; Co-Is:  Gajic , Carter ) has also helped to design and  conduct the first 
multicenter clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a promising ALI prevention agent 
(ClinicalTrials.gov ID:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).72  Specifically, t his trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_511368].  Sixt een geographically diverse institutions 
throughout the US  are enrolling patients into this trial and enrollment is c urrently exceeding plan.   
Experience with the study of transfusion -associated circulatory overload  39 :  Our team ( Co-PI: [INVESTIGATOR_511365] ; Co-I: 
Gajic ) has significant experience with the study of TACO epi[INVESTIGATOR_511369].  In a 
retrospective observational cohort study, we evaluated risk factors for TACO among 901 patients who  were 
transfused in the medical ICU setting.39  Fifty-one (6%) of these patients developed TACO  and 16 were 
associated with RBC transfusion .  Several baseline predictors (e.g. left ventricular dysfunction; plasma ordered 
for the reversal of anticoagulant therapy) and transfusion facto rs (Table 3 ) were iden tified as TACO risk 
predictors . RBC storage duration was longer in the TACO cohort, but this did not meet significance in the 
underpowered subgroup analyses.  
 
Table 3 :  Transfusion characteristics of TACO cases and matched transfused controls.  
 
Recently, our team ( Co-PI: [INVESTIGATOR_511365] ; Co-I: Gajic ) also develop ed innovative electronic health record (EHR) 
surveillance algorithms which can be used to facilitate the detection of transfusion -related pulmonary 
complications.54  Using a study populati on acquired from a  NIH-sponsored prospecrtive cohort investigation ,55, 
we developed optimal TRALI and TACO case detection algorithms using data contained within the EHR .  

 
13 | P a g e  
    These algorithms accurately identified  TRALI  cases  with a sens itivity and specificity of 83.9% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 74.4% -90.4%) and 89.7% (95% CI, 80.3% -95.2%), respectively.  For TACO, the sensitivity and 
specificity were 86.5% (95% CI, 73.6% - 94.0%) and 92.3% (95% CI, 83.4% -96.8%), respectively.   Notably, o f 
true-positive cases identified using the screening algorithms (TRALI/transfused ALI, n = 78; TACO, n = 45), 
only 11 (14.1%) and five (11.1%) were reported to the blood bank by [CONTACT_511399] , respectively.  
The Continuous  AutoTransfusion S ystem (CATS)  can eliminate potentially dangerous BRMs from 
stored allogeneic RBCs :  In addition to previous work demonstrating effective eliminiation of protien8, CFH8, 
and RBC microaggregates10, our preliminary data suggest effective elimination of additional BRMs  as well.  
Specifically, 4 LR -RBC units were washed with 
the CATS device using a 4:1 dilution process as 
previously described.8  RBC -MPs, sCD40L, and 
CCL5  concentrations were assessed before 
and after the washing  procedures .  The 
reduction in microparticle concentration 
exceeded 80 % in all cases evaluated with a 
median (IQR) percent cha nge of 92.2% 
(82.2% – 98.7%) .  Similar  reductions were 
noted in CCL5 for all [ADDRESS_661399] -

Biomarkers as intermediate outcomes for 
clinical lung injury (Grant #:K 23HL112855 -01): 
Our team has substantial experience in the 
study and use of biomarkers as intermediate 
surrogate outcomes for clinical lung injury.  Our 
current K23 award (PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_511365]) specifically aims to 
evaluate the use of biomarkers to better 
understand t he mechanisms underlying 
postoperative acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086] (ARDS).  As prelminary data for the 
present proposal, we evaluated the biomarker 
profiles of [ADDRESS_661400] refined

    PHASE I/II CLINICAL  TRIAL EVALUATING POINT -OF-CARE RBC WASHING TO PREVENT RBC -
ASSOCIATED RESPI[INVESTIGATOR_511370]:   Study procedures are summarized in Figure 5.   We will enroll a total [ADDRESS_661401] one RBC transfusion on the operative day.  We anticipate this will require randomizing up to 
190 patients  in this trial ( 95 per group).   Adult patients (age >18) who are planned to undergo cardiac surgery 
at one of the two participating institutions and who have a predicted RBC transfusion requirement of > 4 units 
will be screened for the exclusion criteria outlined in Table 4.  Predicted RBC transfusion requirements will be 
determined utilizing a recently published large -volume blood transfusion (LVBT)  prediction model (>4 units of 
RBC ).[ADDRESS_661402] ration was chosen because:  1) this transfusion volume 
has been associated with increased risk of pulmonary complications following cardiac surgery58; 2) we have 
previously identified this transfusion volume as a common “dose”  in patients who experience TRALI and/or 
TACO28, 39,42; and 3) this threshold would  still identify a sizable cardiac surgery population, ensuring study 
feasibility.   
 
 

 
15 | P a g e  
    Study procedures:    
Screening:   Study coordinators will screen all adult  (age > 18) patients who are scheduled to undergo coronary 
artery by[CONTACT_511400]/ replacement, 
complex cardiac valve 
surgery, pericardial 
resection , and/or 
ascending aortic surgery 
in one of the two 
participating institutions.  
Eligible patients with a 
predicted transfusion 
requirement of 4 or more 
units will be  approached 
before their elective 
surgical procedure by  a 
study coordinator for 
consent.  After 
confirming the patient’s 
inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, the study 
coordinator at the 
respective institution will 
obtain informed consent 
and assign a study I D 
number to the study participant.  Screening logs will be maintained at each site to allow generation of a 
CONSORT diagram.  
Randomization:   Randomization will occur at  the time of consent and analyses will be conducted using a 
modified intention -to-treat principle (See statistical considerations below). Randomization to RBC washing or 
control group  (standard -issue RBC)  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_1758]’s electronic data management system’s 
Balance (Medidata) algorithm. This software uses dynamic minimization  stratified by [CONTACT_138554].  The 
software will return a confirmation of the randomization indicating the study participant’s treatment allocation 
status .  A note will be placed into the EHR identifying the patient as a study participant  and t he transfu sion 
medicine service will have unblinded, electronic access to the treatment assignment.   Randomization and 
screening will halt after the 154th study participant has undergone surgery and received at least one RBC 
transfusion on the operative day.  Patients randomized but awaiting surgery will continue study participation.  
Study intervention :  The intervention in  this investigation will be implem ented for all allogeneic RBCs 
administered on the day of sugery (intraoperative and postoperatively on Study Day 1 ).  The decision to 
administer an allogeneic RBC transfusion will be left to the responsible clinical service and will not be 
prespecified in the study protocol.  We have elected to leave th is decision to the clinical service for the 
following rea sons:  1) the target population frequently e xperiences major  acute blood loss; in these 
circumstances , typi[INVESTIGATOR_511371] (e.g. Hb ) are often  associated with 
unacceptable time delay s and frequently do not reflect true red blood cell mass nor need for RBC transfusion; 
2) this design facilitate s a more meaningul understanding of the feasibility of RBC washing in clinical  practice.  
Upon receiving an order for allogeneic RBC transfusion, the transfusion medicine service will prepare the RBC 
product according to the allocated treatment assignment ( intervention versus control).  Of note, all allogeneic 
RBC units at the two participating institutions undergo pre -storage leukocyte reduction.  
-Intervention  cohort :  For patients randomized to receive washed RBCs, all allogeneic RBCs administered  
on the day of surgery will be washed with the CATS device prior to transfusion. To account for the time Table 4 .  Exclusion criteria.

    required to complete the ordering, delivery, washing, and administratio n procedures, we will restrict RBC 
washing to those RBC units ordered prior to 23:30 on the day of surgery.  Any RBC unit ordered after 23:30 on 
the day of surgery will no longer be considered an “intervention unit” and will therefore be standard issue (no n-
washed) as it anticipated that the time required to perform the activities mentioned above (ordering, delivery, 
washing, and  administration) would otherwise result in the RBC component’s actual administration time to 
occur on the day after surgery .  When the need for transf usion is identified by [CONTACT_96204], the RBC 
product will be prepared.   As previously described8 and confirmed in our preliminary data, pre -dilution of  
stored , allogeneic  RBCs results in the most effective eli mination of supernatant . Therefore , an approximate  4:1 
dilution will be added to the reservoir of the CATS by [CONTACT_511401].  The “High Quality” wash mode option 
will be selected for processing; this takes approximately 7 -10 minutes to complete.74  Washed RBCs will  then 
be drained from the reinfusion reservoir into sterile transfer bags (Fenwal Inc, Lake Zurich, ILL) for transfusion.  
  
-Control cohort :  For patients randomized to the control group arm, all RBCs administered on the day of 
surgery will be standard -issue RB Cs.   
Off-protocol tr ansfusion s:  In the setting of cardiac surgery, it is occasionall y necessary to provide allogenei c 
RBCs in an emergent fashion (e.g. acute, life -threatening bleeding).  In this particular circumstance,  time -
delays relating to study -related activities may prove unsafe .  To address this potential scenario, our study 
protocol will allow the administration of emergency “off -protocol” allogeneic RBCs.  “Off-protocol” RBC 
transfusions will be administered as per standard institutional practice .  These RBC transfusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_511372] “off -protocol” and will be summarized and analyzed  to assist in assess ing the feasibility 
of point -of-care RBC washing in patients underoing cardiac surgery (see statisti cal description below).  In 
addition, autotransfusion (“cell -saver”) is frequently used in this patient population.  Cell-salvage will be 
implemented at the discretion, and under the direction, of the clinical team.  If cel l-salvage is employed, the 
devic e used for this procedure will be distinict and separate from the intervention CATS device.  
Blinding:  In light of the time-sensitive, point -of-care nature of the intervention being proposed , the patient, 
clinical team , and members of the study team involved  in the RBC washing procedure will not be blinded  to the 
patient ’s treatment allocation status .  Blinding will be ensured for Drs. Norris  and Silliman  who will be running 
the proposed biomarker analyses .    
Other aspects of care:   ARDSnet t rials have demonstrated the benefit of  standardiz ing clinical processes in 
ICU trials.75,[ADDRESS_661403] development of respi[INVESTIGATOR_511373].  To this end, our pro tocol will specify optimal ventilator 
strategies for both the OR and ICU environments (tidal volume < 8 mL/kg predicted body weight; peak 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65168] < 35 cm H 20, PEEP  ≥ 5 cm  while ventilated in the ICU ).  Similarly, although we will not 
pre-specify RBC transfusion thresholds in this protocol, w e will advise restrictive transfusion practices in the 
postoperative period ( hemoglobin target > 8  g/dL in the absence of acute bleeding and/or ischemia ).  This 
transfusion threshold was chosen as i t is the current standard of care at the two participating institutions.  
Standardization of best practices in at -risk patients will decrease the heterogeneity of the risk modifiers that 
may otherwise confound our  associations of interest (RBC washing and intermediate markers of respi[INVESTIGATOR_511374]).  Additionally, each center has adopted protocols on daily spontaneous awakening and 
spontaneous breathing trials to facilitate standardized weaning from ventilators  (see attached appendix for 
specific protocol s).  Non-intubated patients will undergo standard titration of oxygen twice daily  (at 0700 and 
1900, +/ - 2 hours).   Patients saturating 92% or greater  on room air  will not receive supplemental oxygen, 
unless specifically requested by [CONTACT_511402].  If the primary care service requests oxygen 
supplementation for a patient saturating greater than or equal to 92% on room air, the reason for the deviation 
from o xygen weaning will be documented.   Patients will continue to undergo evaluation for oxygen titration until 
liberation from oxygen therapy for [ADDRESS_661404].     
Outcome Measures:   To help ensure the  integrity and quality of the laboratory analyses, all assays will be 
performed by  [CONTACT_93583],  Drs. Norri s and Silliman . The safety outcome analyses (aim 1b) will be an 
exception as these will be run in “real -time” at each enrolling institution . All clinical outcome variables will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_511403] s using standardized definitions and operating procedures.   To the 
 
17 | P a g e  
    extent possible, these study coordinators will also be blinded to the study participant’s treatment allocation 
status. 
Specific Aim 1:  The primary feasibility  outcome  in aim 1a will be the number and proportion of “off -protocol”  
allogeneic RBC  transfusions administered during the study interve ntion period (day of surgery).  A secondary 
feasibility outcome will be the time required for the RBC washing  procedures  (defined  as the time from 
determination of RBC need by [CONTACT_511404]) .  This 
time will be computed for all patients and all transfusions during the study intervention period  (in both the 
intervention and control cohorts) .  The primary safety outcome  in (aim 1b ) include  the change in the RBC 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s  Hb concentration  from pre - to post -transfusion  as well as the concentration of CFH and haptoglobin 
following RBC transfusion.   To assess the primary safety outcome s, samples for total Hb, CFH, and 
haptoglobin will be obtained prior to transfusion, as soon a s possible after the first transfusion, but no later than 
[ADDRESS_661405] intervention/control RBC transfusion, as well as 6 hours (+/ - 30 minutes) an d 18 
hours (+ / - 30 minutes)  from the end of first study RBC transfusion  for all study participants.  We will also 
assess for clinical evidence of acute kidney injury throughout the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   Safety labs will also be drawn 
anytime on study day # 5 if the patient is still in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The primary efficacy outcome in aim 1c  will be 
the change in the c oncentration of neutral lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] [ arachidonic acid, 5 -hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid ( HETE ), 12-
HETE, 15 -HETE] , sCD40L, CCL5/ RANTES, RBC -MPs, and CFH in the RBC component from the pre - to the 
post-wash phase.  These data will allow us to calculate the CATS -related elimination rates for these BRMs, 
which have previously been associated with transfusion -related respi[INVESTIGATOR_511375] .  To balance assay costs while ensuring the scientific success of aim 1c, pre - and post -wash 
samples will be obtained/analyzed for the first 75 washed RBC units.  If efficacy is not clearly established, we 
will continue to obtain both pre - and pos t-wash samples for 75 additional units.    
Specific Aim 2:  The outcomes measures for aim 2a will be the change in concentration of multiple, validated 
lung injury biomarkers representing the primary pathways leading to development of lung injury (Table 5).   
Patients will have blood drawn as soon as possible after  the decision to transfuse, as soon as possible after 
transfusion, but not later than [ADDRESS_661406] study RBC transfusion, 6 hours (+ / - 30 minutes) 
from the end of first study RBC transfusion, and 18 hours (+ / - 30 minutes) from the end of first study RBC 
transfusion.

In addition to these biomarker analyse s, we will proceed with detailed assess ment of the cardiopulmonary  
responses to  study  RBC transfusion s administered  in the operating room  (Aim 2b ).  Specific variables to be 
asses sed and recorded are listed in T able 6.   Systemic vascular resistance will b e calculated at each time 
point using the following equation:  SVR (dyns/cm5) = [(MAP – RAP)/CO]  x 80.  Each of these variables will be 
assessed and recorded immediately prior to the intervention RBC transfusion and again immediately after the 
RBC transfusion.  Standard 
operating procedures for these 
cardiopulmonary assessments will 
be defined prior to study  onset  
according to previous ly established 
recommendations .[ADDRESS_661407] been selected to evaluate specific potential mechanistic 
pathways for  TRALI and TACO ( aim 2c ).  N-terminal BNP has been included as a marker of volume 
overload/ventricular strain.  To better elucidate the relationship between the “dose” of these soluble BRMs in 
the RBC components, their subsequent concentration in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and their ultimat e relationship to 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s cardiopulmonary response to transfusion, levels of these potential putative agents will be 
determined in the RBC components prior to transfusion (in both the washed and standard issue cohorts) as 
well as in the transfusion rec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  As we are targeting surgical patients who are expected to receive > [ADDRESS_661408] 
compromise between study feasibility and scientific validity.  In the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] , samples for the putative BRM 
assessments will be obtained at the same time points outlined above for the lung injury biomarker samples.    
 
Specific Aim 3 :  To facilit ate the design and conduct of future clinical trials, we will also pursue a number of 
exploratory  clinical outcomes.  The clinical outcome measure of interest for aim [ADDRESS_661409] data daily until endotracheal extubation, 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_511378]. The primary clinical outcome will 
then be determined by [CONTACT_511405], 
determined by [CONTACT_511406].   If the study 
participant is extubated prior to ICU admission, the duration of mechanical ventilation will be assigned as 0 
hours.  Recognizing the poten tial for early death (intraoperative or early postoperative) biasing our pri mary 
clinical  outcome, the number of ventilator free days (VFD) at postoperative day [ADDRESS_661410] had no additional days of mechanical ventilation following 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Additional secondary outcomes for A im 3 will include evaluations of hypoxemia (SpO 2, 
PaO 2/FiO 2), duration of oxygen supplementation, sequential organ failure assessment scores, and durations of 
ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].   The clinical diagnoses of TRALI, possible TRALI, and/or TACO will be measured 
through study day 5, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], whichever comes first.

the addition of ice -cold methanol, proteins will be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_135162], and non -polar lipi[INVESTIGATOR_511382]/analyzed 
using high -pressure liquid chromatography (LC) interface d into the electrospray source of a triple quadrupole 
mass spectrometer (MS) (liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry 
[LC/MS/MS]).  Lipid concentrations will be estimated using ratios to an internal standard (2H8-5-HETE),  as 
previously described.101,103   
Predictor variables other than the intervention:   Pertinent baseline demographics and clinical 
characteristics such as age, sex , race, and comorbidities  will be  recorded.  Additional predictor variables will 
include:  vital signs and laboratory values that are obtained during the course of routine care,  APACHE IV 
score, administration of statins, ace-inhibitors , insulin, amiodarone, o r steroids; blood product adm inistration  for 
the up to day [ADDRESS_661414] , daily fluid status, and vasopressor requirements.  
Quality Control and Data Management:   Mayo Clinic will serve as the DSCC  to coordinate data collection, 
quality control and data analysis.  The principal investigators at each study site will be r esponsible for the 
quality control of data collection according to standard definitions that are provided in the protocol.  In additi on, 
the strategies to achieve a high level of protocol adherence will include 1) refresher education sessions for 
study coordinators two weeks after the study onset, 2) periodic  checks of protocol compliance by [CONTACT_10117] s at the DSCC  and 3) computerized identification of protocol violations in the database.   
Mayo Clinic has implemented  an enterprise -wide Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS).  CTMS is a [ADDRESS_661415] will serve as 
the electronic data capt ure and randomization system for the study.  The system has comprehensive audit 
trails, user authentication, security and/or disaster plans, and standardized training for end users.  The system 
provides real -time, cross -form data integrity checks to maximi ze data integrity while lessening the need for on -
site source document verification  (See Facilities and Resources) .   
 
Statistical Considerations  (prepared in collaboration with our statistical:   Aim 1 is centered on the 
clinical and technical feasibility of on -demand RBC washing (hypothesis 1a). Feasibility is defined as the 
administration of protocol RBCs instead of “off-protocol” standard -issue RBCs . Simon’s two -stage design will 
be used to determine if the protocol needs to be modified to prepare RBCs prior to the surgical procedure . The 
null hypothesis rate for feasibility is p<=0.75 versus the alternative that p>=0.90, where p is the probability o f 
successfully preparing and administering  the intervention RBCs. Stage [ADDRESS_661416] 16 
cases randomized to RBC washing. If 12 or fewer transfusions were deemed “feasible”, the protocol will be 
modified to pre -wash RBCs (see limit ations). I f 13 or more are feasible, an additional 32 cases will be 
evaluated. Should 39 or fewer (of the 48 studied) not be feasible, the protocol will be modified to pre -wash.  If 
40 or more cases meet the feasibility definition, the remainder of the stu dy will go as originally planned. 
(Sample size/ design calculations details: PASS 2008, alpha=0.10, beta=0.10, Optimal design). The safety 
endpoint for aim 1 is the change in hemoglobin level (hypothesis 1b). The change in hemoglobin after the first 
transf used unit will be used as the primary safety measure.  Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to compare 
change in hemoglobin levels between randomized groups. The change in concentrations of  soluble  BRMs (e.g. 
 
20 | P a g e  
    neutral lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] ; hypothesis 1c) will be assessed  using paired t -tests. There is >  80% power to detect a 0.[ADDRESS_661417] -washing with 78 washed RBC products. Should there be fewer (due to fe asibility), 
power will decrease.  However, the magnitude of differences observed in preliminary data  (92% reduction, 
Figure 4) is many times l arger than an effect size of 0.4.  Therefore , power for this hypothesis should not be a 
concern.  
 
Aim 2 examines the changes in biomarkers levels measured over three time points ( Baseline, no later than [ADDRESS_661418] RBC transfusion,  6 hours (+ / - 30 minutes) from the end of first study RBC 
transfusion, and 18 hours (+ / - 30 minutes) from the end of first study RBC transfusion . Mixed models will be 
fit to model the linear trajectory of these biomarkers. A model with a random slope and intercept will be 
considered initially, and the primary parameter of interest will be the treatment group by [CONTACT_6491]. For 
this analysis, a “modified” intention to treat (ITT) principle will be considered. Only patien ts randomized to RBC 
washing who  receive at least one unit of the washed cells will be included from RBC washing group in the 
analysis. Those not receiving RBC washed cells will  be in the considered the control group. The reason for this 
is this aim is focused on mechanistic action and demonstrating biologic plausibility prior to formal evaluation of 
clinical outcomes (which would be analyzed using traditional ITT considerations) . Since the functional form of 
the changes in biomarkers over time is not known, a discrete ([ADDRESS_661419]) representation of time will also be 
used to gauge the linearity assumption as well as provide a sensitivity analysis to the primary regression 
model. Standard mixed modeling practices will be utilized (e.g., assessment of residuals, verification of 
variance components, nested modeling to simply variance components and covariance patterns, etc). This 
modeling scenario will be conducted for each biomarker  of interest. Since prior research have noted that these 
outcomes are “clustered”, the methodology by [CONTACT_511407] . will be used to adjust for multiple comparisons.104  We 
will also compute O’Brien’s nonparametric global test statistic to provide an overall measure of treatment effect 
between the two treatment groups.  
 
The effects of storage duration will also be assessed. The mean age of the transfused blood products will b e 
determined. This value will be used to test for effect modification (interaction with treatment). Specifically, the 
main effect of RBC age, its interaction action with treatment, time and the treatment -by-time interaction term 
will be used to determine i f the biomarker trajectories are affected by [CONTACT_511408]. It is hypothesized that the 
washing protocol will attenuate the effects of age resulting in more uniform trajectories over the range of RBC 
age where as the unwashed RBC will show increases in biomarker  values as RBC age increases . 
 
Sample Size Considerations : The sample size for this  clinical trial is based on the mechanistic outcomes 
detailed for Specific Aim [ADDRESS_661420] deviation from the 
interquartile range (SD~=IRQ/1.35), the median effect size was found to be 0.4. This magnitu de of change 
would be relevant, and appropriate to power this study on. With equal allocation between the groups, the 
sample size for this study is estimated to be n=78/group (alpha=0.10, two -sided; see additional statistical 
considerations below). Actual power is expected to be higher on account of the repeated measures design. To 
allow for drop out and “non -feasible” cases , we plan to enroll and randomize patients until [ADDRESS_661421] analytical measures for comparing randomized treatment groups with ITT. For data 
that may be skewed (e.g., length of ventilation, ICU stay), Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to compare 
groups.  Serial measurements (oxygen saturation) will be analyzed using longitudinal summary statistics (e.g., 
AUC, mean value). It should be noted that the intermediate clinical outcomes are not being powered for in this 
study. Estimates of precision (confide nce intervals) along with range of responses will be used to guide 
subsequent trial designs  (e.g. a larger pha se II/III trial with clinical outcomes as the primary outcome  of 
interest ).  
 
21 | P a g e  
    Additional statistical considerations : Consistent with early phase cl inical trials, we have selected a level of 
significance higher than the traditional 0.05. This will facilitate advancement of the technique should it prove 
feasible and demonstrates potential efficacy. It is noted that multiple testing may increase the ove rall family 
wise error rate, so further research, particularly with clinical events, will be needed to quantify clinical efficacy 
of the approach. Missing data is expected to be minimal during the course of the study given the close 
surveillance the surgic al and ICU environment provides. Missing specimens may occur in the event of patient 
discharge, death or administrative issues. Initial analyses will be conducted under the assumption of 
MCAR/MAR (ignorable missing).  Sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation and pattern mixture models will 
be used to assess the robustness of the model assumptions.  The analysis of specific aim 2 proposes to use a 
modification of the ITT principle. Justification for this is that i t is a mechanistic aim with blinded examiners. We 
are interested in quantifying the effects of washing as clearly (and perhaps ideally) this is an early phase trial.  
In Aim 3, the clinical outcomes will b e assessed using the traditional ITT definition to provide a more realistic 
measure of the effect size for planning subsequent studies.  
 
 
 
Protocol Addendum:  
 
The Aim 1c RBC washing efficacy outcome analyses evaluating the first 75 washed RBC units, comparing  the 
pre-wash ed soluble biologic response modifi er (BRM) concentrations to the post -wash ed unit concentrations, 
have been completed in collaboration with Drs. Norris and Silliman.   The Aim 1c findings indicate a decrease 
in the RBC micro -particle  and cytokine concentrations,  indicating the CATS washing  procedure was effective in 
removing the BRM’s that have previously been associated with transfusion -related cardiopulmonary  
dysfunction.  However, the analyses also noted increased concentrations of cell free hemoglobin  (CFH) .   
 
In an effort to  further understand the potential relevance/clinical importance, if any, of the increase in CFH,  we 
will obtain [ADDRESS_661422] the hematocrit levels before and after washing in 20 RBC units is the result of our 
interactions with the l ead statistician of this protocol who has estimated this to be a sufficient sample size to 
better understand the increase in cell free hemoglobin in relation to the total hemoglobin present in the 
allogeneic RBC units.

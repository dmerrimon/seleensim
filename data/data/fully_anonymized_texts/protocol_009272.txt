There is a global pandemic caused by [CONTACT_7547] -CoV- 2 virus, which threatens the lives of many 
and the economic stability of the world.  Therapeutic approaches are badly needed, and an orally 
available, well tolerated small molecule agent could play a critical part in preventing and 
ameliorating COVID -19.

China, indicates that favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42698] -CoV-2.

8.4.2 Definition of an Adverse Event  
The FDA Safety Guidance, referencing 21CFR312.32(a), defines an Adverse Event as follows: 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related.    
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable  and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug and does not imply any judgment about causality.  An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with 
another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.    
Adverse Events are NOT : 
• Clinical events related to the progression of COVID -19. 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion).  The condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g.,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10800], social and/or convenience admissions).  
8.4.3 Evaluating and Reporting of Adverse Events 
All AEs (i.e . a new event or an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition) that occur after dosing 
with favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42719] + SOC  arm, must be 
recorded as an AE or SAE (if applicable), on the Adverse Event e CRF and SAE form, as applicable.  
The Site Investigator must follow all AEs until the AE resolves, or until the Site Investigator and/or 
the Medical Monitor  determine the event is chronic or clinically stable.  If an AE remains 
unresolved at the conclusion of the study, the  Site Investigator and Medical Monitor will make a 
clinical assessment to determine whether continued follow -up of the AE is warranted.  All subjects 
who have received at least one exposure to study therapy will be evaluated for safety of  study 
treatment.  
The Site Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms 
and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
All AEs must be promptly documented on the Adverse Event eCRF  and assessed by [CONTACT_42737].  Details of the event must include the dates of onset and resolution, severity, 
relationship to study drug, seriousness, and whether the event caused the subj ect to withdraw from 
the study, outcome and timing with regard to administration of the study drug.  
Severity:  Severity should be graded and recorded as follows: 
• Mild: Awareness of event but easily tolerated  
• Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity

Relationship:  The relationship of the Adverse Event to the study drug will be determined initially 
by [CONTACT_42738], and a ssessed using the following definitions: 
• Related:  There is a distinct temporal relationship between the event onset and administration 
of the study drug.  There is a known reaction to agent or chemical group or predicted by [CONTACT_7552].  The event c annot be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
• Unrelated:   Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., pre -
existing condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication). 
Final determination of relatedness will be made by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Expectedness:  Whether or not the  event was excepted or unexpected. Further details on this can 
be found in section 8.5. These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide  for determining the 
causal assessment.  If it is felt that the event is not related to study drug therapy, then an alternative 
explanation should be provided. 
8.4.4 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
All SAEs as defined below and that occur after the first dose of favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42720] [ADDRESS_44919] also be reported.  
8.4.5 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is an AE from this study that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death ( even if caused by  [CONTACT_4113]- 19 all deaths are recorded as SAEs)  
• Life-threatening situation (subject is at im mediate risk of death ) 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug 
NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and  may require medical or sur gical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
A life -threatening AE is defined as any adverse experience that places the subject in the view of the 
Site Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.   This does not include 
an event that might have led to death, if it had occurred with greater severity.  
 “Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7521], for any length of time  with a minimum one overnight stay.  Presentation and care within 
an emergency department does not necessarily constitute an SAE.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE.

The procedure for reporting SAEs, regardless of causal relationship , is as follows: 
• Within 24 hours of the Site Investigator’s knowledge of an SAE, the site must notify the 
Sponsor by [CONTACT_7553], medical monitor or other Sponsor representative. 
They should also immediately complete the AE eCRF and select “Serious”.  
• This initial reporting of an SAE should contain as much information as is available to the 
Invest igator.  Submission of the SAE via the EDC should not be delayed in order to collect 
additional information to complete the form.  
• Follow- up SAE reports may be generated in cases in which additional information becomes 
available.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], autopsy reports, and other documents may become available and 
scanned copi[INVESTIGATOR_42721].  The follow -up SAE report 
should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation.  
• The Sponsor  (or designee)  will distribute completed SAE forms, which may be used to notify 
the IRB when applicable, via a secure internet-based document depository. 
• The Si te Investigator should notify the IRB of Serious Adverse Events occurring at the site and 
other adverse reports received from the Sponsor  in accordance with  reporting requirements of 
the governing IRB.  
The Site Investigator must take all therapeutic measu res necessary for resolution of the SAE.  Any 
medications necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded onto the concomitant medication section of the subject’s e CRF.  However, treatment medication should only be recorded in the 
narrative description  section of the SAE form.  
8.5 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
A S[LOCATION_003]R carries specific and time- based reporting requirements for the Sponsor of a clinical trial. 
Thus, after a  Site Investigator reports an SAE, the FDA expects the Sponsor will determine whether 
it meets the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R.  
A S[LOCATION_003]R is defined according to 3 criteria:  
1. The AE is deemed a “suspected adverse reaction” if there is a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the AE.  A “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and adverse event.  
2. The AE is “Serious” if it meets the definition of an SAE provided in section  8.4.5 
3. The AE is deemed “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or if in the IB, has not been reported at the severity observed.  
In cases where the Sponsor deems a S[LOCATION_003]R has occurred, it must file an IND Safety Report with the FDA.  FPHU will require the assistance and cooperation of the  Site Investigator and staff to 
provide accurate and complete information on the subject and observed SAE so that reporting requirements to the FDA can be met.

IND safety reports are used to submit reports of S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the FDA.  There are 2 types of reports:  
• A “15 -day report” is used when the reported S AE is a S[LOCATION_003]R and requires that as much 
information as is available to the investigator and the sponsor, be submitted to the FDA in on 
the appropriate form. For US trials, the appropriate form is the FDA Form 3500A also commonly known as a “MedWatch” form.  
• A “7 -day report” is used when the S[LOCATION_003]R is considered to be fatal or life- threatening.  
The 7 -day and 15- day timelines begin the day that the  Sponsor determines the information qualifies 
for reporting  and are counted in calendar days – not business days.  Therefore, it is important that 
the Site investigator carefully follow the reporting requirements described in section  8.4.6. 
8.6 Clinical Laboratory Abn ormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments 
Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorded as AEs unless considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_7554].  An abnormal laboratory result will be considered an AE if it induces clinical signs or  symptoms, if the abnormality is of a degree that requires active 
management (e.g. discontinuation of the study drug, dose modification) or when the event is requiring treatment or other therapeutic intervention (e.g. iron supplements, blood transfusion, e tc.). 
The Investigator will evaluate the relationship of any significantly abnormal result to protocol treatment and clinical condition, if possible.  All clinically significant abnormal laboratory results will be followed until they return to normal or be come stabilized .

assessed for seriousness, and reported as an SAE . 
9 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Complete details of all statistical analyses, including methods for handling missing data, will be included in a formal statistical analysis plan (SAP), to be completed as soon as possible after stud y 
initiation.  
9.1 General Considerations  
For the primary comparison, the following will be tested:  
• Null hypothesis: time to cessation of oral shedding is equal in control and treatment; 
• Alternative hypothesis: time to cessation of oral shedding differs between control and 
treatment.  
Hypothesis tests will be two sided and conducted at an overall alpha = 0.05 level of significance.

or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate, in the safety analysis set.  
 
9.2 Sample size justificatio n 
Approximately 180 patients will be enrolled. 
Assuming 1:[ADDRESS_44922] at the alpha=0.[ZIP_CODE] level 
of significance for the final analysis, 79 events will provide 80% power to detect a hazard ratio 
of 2.03. This leaves alpha=0.[ADDRESS_44923] patient, and a drop out of 10% in the control arm, it is estimated that the total sample size required to achieve 79 events is 120 (60 patients in each arm). We assume 33% of patients will test negative for SARS -CoV-2 virus by [CONTACT_937]-PCR on Day 
1, thus the total sample size required to be randomized is 180 (120/0.67). The assumption of 33% is based on calculations performed after the DSMB recommended a sample size re -estimation to 
account for the patients who test negative at baseline and do not contribute meaningfully to the primary analysis.  
9.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Summary statistics will be provided per treatment group for demographic (e.g., age, height, weight, 
body mass index [BMI], race , gender) and other initial subject characteristics (e.g., medical history, 
concomitant diseases) will be provided per treatment group and for the total group. The ITT population will be used for the summaries.  
9.4 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be defined for the study: 
The intent- to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomized patients. Patients will be analyzed 
according to their assigned treatment arm. All efficacy analyses will be completed in the ITT 
population.  The safety population will include all patients who receive study treatment. Patients will be analyzed according to actual treatment received. All safety analyses will be completed in the safety population.  
9.5 Stratification, Subgroup Analysis and Pooled Analysis  
Following consent, those subjects meeting all entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio  
Treatment Arm: favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] + SOC  
Control Arm: placebo + SOC  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (>=50 and <50 years old) and sex .

9.6 Efficacy  Endpoint Analysis  
Descriptive analyses  
Descriptive statistics (proportions for categorical variables, means, medians, standard deviations , 
and interquartile ranges for continuous variables) will be reported for all key patient variables, 
including ba seline and demographic characteristics, use of medications, compliance, and study 
completion status.  Data that are missing on key patient characteristics and the outcome will be fully described, including any patterns of missingness (i.e., any relationships between missingness of a variable and patient characteristics).  
 A CONSORT diagram displaying the number of patients screened, eligible, and consented along with reasons for ineligibility will be provided. Graphical tools such as histograms, boxplots, a nd 
scatterplots will be created to assess quality of data and to display patterns over time.  
Primary efficacy analysis 
Time until shedding cessation will be compared between the two treatment arms using a Cox 
proportional hazards model adjusted for age and sex and stratified by [CONTACT_3725]. The test will be 
performed at the alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_44925] ratio for shedding cessation will be estimated, along with its 95% confidence interval, from a Cox proportional hazards model. If the proportional hazards assumption is not met, we will consider an extended Cox model that relaxes the proportional hazards assumption. 
 
The distribution of shedding cessation will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method, and 
Kaplan -Meier curves will be presented for each treatment arm. Time to shedding cessation at the 
end of the study period along with 95% confidence intervals will be presented for each treatment arm.  
Secondary efficacy analyses  
The distribution of cessation of symptoms will be estimated using th e Kaplan -Meier method, and 
Kaplan -Meier curves will be presented for each treatment arm. Time to cessation of symptoms at 
the end of the study period along with 95% confidence intervals will be presented for each treatment arm. The hazard ratio for cessati on of symptoms will be estimated, along with its 95% confidence 
intervals, from a Cox proportional hazards model. Time to cessation of symptoms will be 
determined by [CONTACT_42739]. Resolution of symptoms requires that symptoms are mild o r absent for at least 24 hours.

appropriate, in the safety analysis set.  
 
The original exact terms in the electronic data capture (EDC) system used by [CONTACT_42740] -19 will be fully described and coded according to the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment- emergent AEs will be defined 
as those occurring coincident with start of treatment and through [ADDRESS_44927] counts and percentages of subjects with the event. This summary will include subjects with any TEAE,  any treatment -
related TEAE, any serious TEAE, any treatment -related serious TEAE, TEAEs leading to study 
infusion discontinuation, treatment- related TEAEs leading to study infusion discontinuation, 
TEAEs leading to death, and treatment -related TEAEs leadi ng to death. The difference in 
proportions between treatment groups in each of these categories will be calculated.  
 Summaries of changes over time in laboratory parameters, as well as counts and percentages of laboratory parameters that are Low, Normal, a nd High compared to the reference ranges will be 
presented by [CONTACT_42741]. Shift tables will be presented for laboratory parameters with defined severity grades.  
10 INTERIM ANALYSIS  
An interim analysis for safety and overwhelming efficacy will be performed once 50% of patients have 24 hours of follow -up complete. Enrollment will pause once 50% of patients have received 
treatment and will remain paused until the DSMC makes their recommendation after their safety review. The DSMC will meet one or two days after enrollment is paused to review the safety data collected within the first [ADDRESS_44928] 
blood count labs collected at day 5 to be available in approximately 25% of patients at the time of the DSMC review.   The DSMC will also review the efficacy data on all randomized participants at this meeting. The interim efficacy analysis will use the same methods as are planned for the final analysis using the 
ITT analysis. Based on the results of the interim analysis, the DSMC will either recommend to the 
sponsor to terminate the study for overwhelming efficacy (p<0.[ZIP_CODE] at the interim analysis),

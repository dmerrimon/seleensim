Surgical Skin Closure device from ZipLine Medical, Inc. (Campbell, CA [LOCATION_003]) is a more recent method of skin 
closure that utilizes skin adhesive and adjust able ratcheting straps to achieve and maintain tension necessary 
for wound closure and healing.  The Zip device was designated Class I, 510(k) Exempt by [CONTACT_40563] 2010, 
and the CE Mark was affixed in 2014.  Clinical studies comparing the Zip device to staples and sutures have 
demonstrated several benefits, including:  
• Fewer wound -related readmissions compared to staples on TKA patients1 
• Can eliminate a home health nurse visit compared to staples on TKA patients2 
• 3x faster wound closure compared to subcut icular sutures on pacemaker patients3 
• Superior cosmetic scar quality compared to subcuticular suture for pediatric cardiac sternotomy 
patients4 
• Less patient pain during removal compared to subcuticular suture (Prolene®) for pediatric cardiac 
sternotomy pat ients5 
• Superior protection of wound from extrinsic distraction forces compared to sutures6 
Limited patient -reported satisfaction data exists for the Zip device as compared to staples and sutures, so 
this study will attempt to address this need.  
2.2 Purpose of the study  
To evaluate patient satisfaction of closure method used after knee joint arthroplasty .  Metal staples and the 
Zip® Surgical Skin Closure device are approved methods in regular use.  Selection of method is generally 
based on physician preference.  This study is to determine what, if any, differences exist in patient 
satisfaction amongst the t wo methods.

ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 6 of 19 3 Device Description  
3.1  Device Overview  
ZipLine Medical, Inc. has developed a novel, non -invasive skin closure device called “Z ip Surgical Skin Closure” 
to replace sutures, staples and glue for closure of the skin layer for surgical incisions or laceration repair.  The 
device is designed to provide closure speed superior to sutures, while resulting in a suture -like cosmetic 
outcom e.  Both pre -clinical feasibility study data and feedback from over 2000 human cases during the 
device’s commercial use in the [LOCATION_003] suggest that these design intentions are correct.  This study will test 
these assertions in a controlled clinical setting, wi th the goal of providing results with statistical significance .     
The Zip device is a single use, sterile medical device.  
 
 
Figure 1. Zip Surgical Skin Closure Device  
 
The Zip Surgical Skin Closure Device is applied to clean, dr y skin after deeper tension -relieving (i.e., dermal or 
subcutaneous) sutures have been applied.  
 
The device adheres to the skin adjacent to an incision by [CONTACT_253363] -sensitive skin adhesives.  A 
combination of acrylic and hydrocolloid adhesives are us ed to provide a skin -friendly environment while 
providing the necessary tack to maintain skin adhesion during the recommended wear time of the device. 
The Zip device will be placed on the incision  as the  surgeon approximates the incision edges and tensions the 
wound by [CONTACT_551119].  Once the desired tension is  achieved, the 
excess strap ends are trimmed with scissors, and a conventional absorptive dressing may be applied.   The Zip 
will remain on the skin for 3 weeks, at which point it will be removed.

Figure 2. Adjusting Incision Closure Tension  
 
After application , patients may shower (but not soak in a tub or pool) with the device on.  The device is 
removed by [CONTACT_551120], taking care not to apply stress 
to the incision.  If there is a risk of skin strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], an adhesive removal agent may be used during removal.  
 
 
Figu re 3. Key Components of the Zip Surgical Skin Closure Device  
In addition to the pressure -sensitive adhesives, the device’s closure and force distribution components are 
made up of polyurethane monofilm, polyethylene tape, polyester  and nylon.  
 
4 Regulatory Status

6.1 Screen / Informed Consent Pr ocess  
Patients considered to be eligible candidates for the study will be approached to understand their willingness 
and interest of volunteering for the study.  The informed consent process will then be performed in the 
following manner:  
 
Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained as outlined in 21 CFR Part 50 and the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated 
Guidance (ICH, April 1996).  
 
Eligible patients will be introduced to the study opportunity during a pre -operative visit.  Patients will be 
given the o pportunity to have their questions answered, either at the time of their visit, or after the visit via 
phone or email .  Patients will be given the opportunity to provide consent at the time of their visit or at a 
later time if they need time to consider pa rticipating.  A research study member at the approved study site 
will speak with the study candidate about the purpose of the study.  Explanation of the study background, 
study procedure, follow up visit schedule, study procedure risks and benefits will be  reviewed in detail with 
the patient.  Patients will be given the time they need to read through the study information and informed 
consent document and ask as many questions as necessary to make them comfortable with the study and 
the requirements.  
 
For those potential candidates who agree to participate in the study by [CONTACT_551121] (ICF), a baseline evaluation will be conducted .  Consent may be obtained by [CONTACT_551122].   
 
If a patient does not have the capacity to give informed consent, they will be excluded from consideration for 
enrollment.  If an enrolled subject loses the capacity to reasonably complete the study questionnaire surveys 
during the study, they shall be discharged from the study.  
 
The investigator will ensure that prospective subjects have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the 
information represented by [CONTACT_551123] w hether or not to participate or allow participation in research. The investigator shall, 
based on clinical judgment, determine if the study candidate  understood the information presented  
 
The investigator shall be responsible for ensuring that valid consen t is obtained and documented for all 
subjects. All study records including the completed consent forms and patient satisfaction  questionnaires 
shall be maintained in a secure location in the investigator’s clinic and handled in a manner that maintains 
conf identiality of the data.   
 
ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 10 of 19 6.2 Baseline Evaluation  / Eligibility Determination / Enrollment  
The study investigator or study staff member will conduct a formal evaluation for study eligibility which may 
include reviewing medical history and understanding genera l health.  When the subject is determined eligible 
and scheduled for the arthroplasty procedure they will be enrolled into the study.   
6.[ADDRESS_724166] disposition will be 
accounted for in study reports.    
 
Subjects will be assigned in consecutive order in a 1:1 ratio for closure assignment (Metal Staples:Zip Closure 
Device) until all subjects are enrolled.

8 Study Withdrawal  
Subjects may be terminated or withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
• Voluntary withdrawal – meaning that the subject voluntarily c hooses not to further participate in the study  
• Lost to follow -up – meaning that the subject is more than one month late (beyond the late visit window) to 
a study visit and [ADDRESS_724169] to follow -up. 
• In the physician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue study participation.  
• Subject death.   
 
 
Any study subject who does not attend a scheduled follow -up visit should be contact[CONTACT_551124](s).  The reason for the missed visit should be determined and 
documented in the subject’s study records.  All subjects enrolled (inc luding those withdrawn or lost to follow -up) 
shall be accounted  for with appropriate documentation .  
 
 
ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 12 of 19 9 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) may occur during the procedure phase or the follow -up phase of the study.  Adverse events 
occurring after the baseline  assessment but before the arthroplasty procedure will be documented in the subject’s 
medical record but will not count as related to the closure device.   
Each adverse event will be recorded in the corresponding subject’s CRF.  Each adverse event will be judged by [CONTACT_551125] .  In addition, the Investigator will 
identify the date of onset, severity and duration of the AE.  All adverse events will be monitored until they are 
adequat ely resolved or explained.  If a subject reaches the final follow -up visit and is experiencing a new or ongoing 
adverse event, the study sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_138544]/or methods for continued surveillance 
of the event.  
The Investigato r must submit to the Sponsor a report of any Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Serious Adverse Device

12 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Risk Category.  This is a minimal risk study. T he probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in 
the research are not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine 
physical or psychological examinations or tests.  
Potential risks associated  with the use of the closure methods in this study as standard of care do not differ from 
those commonly used for closing wounds, incisions or lacerations.   
 
Potential risks associated with the closure methods used in this study  are listed below.  Subject s will be monitored 
closely as part of this study to allow for detection of symptoms, should they be present.  This, in turn, should allow 
for early treatment or intervention, if necessary.  
The following are side effects that may occur as a result of use of closure methods used to repair incisions  after the 
arthroplasty procedure :  
• Blistering from overtightening of the Zip Closure D evice causing excessive stretch force applied to the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]  
• Edema which can cause skin shearing, skin blistering or loss of  adhesion to occur  
• Skin strippi[INVESTIGATOR_551116] a result of any surgical tape or adhesive applied to skin  
• Allergic reaction to the adhesive product including hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_551117]  
• Infection resulting from any bacteria in troduced into the incision  
• Dehiscence requiring intervention  
• Device failure / malfunction  
• Edema  
• Wound site pain / discomfort  
• Excessive scarring including:  
o Step -off 
o Contour irregularities  
o Excessive distortion  
o Poor cosmetic appearance  
Protection Against Risks  
This is a minimal risk study.  Nonetheless, all efforts will be made to minimize any potential risk . Risks will be 
minimized through the use of  an Investigator with a high degree of experience in orthopaedic surgery.  The 
Investigator has received sponsor -led training in proper use of the device, prior to study initiation and as 
warranted throughout the study.  The sponsor will monitor the study for any trends that would indicate a safety 
 
ZipLine Confidential Information   Page 14 of 19 issue.    
Potential Risks to Patient Confidentiality  
In all clinical studies, confidentiality of protected health information may be breached due to study -related 
activities beyond those of routine clinical care .  This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_551127] (CRFs) or other study -related documentation to be provided to the study 
sponsor  
Potential Benefits to the Subjects  
There are no potential benefits to t he subjects other than the satisfaction of having helped improve the body of 
knowledge on the study subject, which may lead to future preference towards a super ior wound closure modality 
in a subsequent surgery .  
Alternatives to Participation  
Since this is  a patient -participation survey and not an experimental study, the only alternative to participation is to 
not participate .

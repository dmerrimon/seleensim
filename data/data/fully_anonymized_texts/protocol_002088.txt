 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Title of Study :  Fresolimumab and Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in  
Early Stage Non -Small Cell Lung cancer  
Study Phase:   1-2 
Study Center(s):    Stanford University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_857235]:   
Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has emerged as an effective and safe treatment modality for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  However, 
most patients develop significant fibrosis of lung tissue in the target region, which inhibits local lung function and complicates early diagnosis of possible tumor recurrence.  Additionally, the main pattern of failure after SABR for early stage 
NSCLC is regional/distant recurrence.  Thus, there is an unmet need for therapeutic 
strategies that can reduce post-treatment fibrosis and decrease regional/distant 
recurrence.  
Phase 1: Primary Objective:  
Evaluate the safe dose of fresolimumab in combination with SABR in patients  
Secondary Objectives:  
• Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving fresolimumab plus SABR  
• Evaluate post-treatment changes in pulmonary function  
• Evaluate recurrence rates and progression-free survival  (PFS) 
• Assess pha rmacokinetics (PK) of fresolimumab in combination with SABR 
(optional for patient)  
• Evaluate the rate and severity of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis  after SABR 
plus fresolimumab  
Phase 2: Primary Objective:  
Evaluate the rate of moderate-to-severe radiation -induced pulmonary fibrosis  after 
SABR plus fresolimumab 
Secondary Objectives:  
• Evaluate the pattern of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus 
fresolimumab 
• Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving fresolimumab pl us SABR  
• Evaluate post-t reatment changes in pulmonary function  
• Evaluate recurrence rates and progression -free survival  (PFS)  
Hypothesis:  
We hypothesize that inhibition of TGFβ using fresolimumab will reduce the 
development of radiation -induced pul monary fibrosis after SABR for  early stage 
NSCLC.  
Phase 1 will help determine a safe and tolerable dose of fresolimumab in combination 
with SABR in patients with early stage NSCLC.  After the dose has been determined, we will then proceed to a single-arm, phase 2 study, in which patients will receive 
fresolimumab at the dose determined from Phase  1 in addition to SABR.   
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 7 of 44 30 June 2 022 
 
 
 Study Design:  
We propose a prospective, phase 1-[ADDRESS_1194158] 10 subjects 
through 6 months foll ow-up.  In the event that there are ≥  [ADDRESS_1194159] Cancer  Institut e Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC).  I f, after review, the DSMC recomme nds proceeding with the 
study, the report of the safety review will be submitted to the IND, and 
FDA’s  concurrence will be sought before proceeding with enrollment.   
Similarly, development of new malignancies will be monitored for the first  10 patients 
through the 6 month follow -up time point [except keratoacanthomas / squamous cell 
carcinomas  (SCC) of the skin].  Keratoacanthomas and SCC are not included 
because these are known events that regress after discontinuation of fresolimumab therapy, per the Inv estigator’s  Brochure.  These lesions will be referred to a 
dermatologic oncologist or dermatologist for evaluation, treatment, and monitoring, 
but will not be tabulated towards the criteria for enrollment pause.  New malignancies 
are expected to be rare, and if more than 2 subjects develop new malignancies , 
enrollment would be similarly paused for a comprehensive safety  review as above.  
Primary and Secondary Endpoint(s):  
Phase 1: Primary Endpoint 
Dose limiting toxicities  (DLTs) of fresolimumab when combined with SABR  
Secondary Endpoint

Sample size justification: 
Phase 1: 
Post-SABR pneumonitis is expected to oc cur in ≤ 10% of patients with stage I disease.  
Based on this percentage, we propose to start out with a cohort of 5 patients at the pre-selected dose of 3mg/kg of fresolimumab.  If one patient develops DLT, then 5 more 
patients will be enrolled at the same dose to make a total of 10 patients.  If no more 
patients experience DLT, then the total percentage of patients experiencing DLT is 10% 
and is considered acceptable for toxicity.  
Phase 2: 
A sample of size [ADDRESS_1194165] 80% power to detect a decrease in the 
incidence of post SABR moderate-to-severe fibrosis from 75 % to 60% with a one sided 
significance level of 10%.

IRB-[ZIP_CODE] Page 11of 44 30 June 2022Patient Acceptability/Ethics and Consent Issues:
SABR is the definitive treatments for patients with stage I NSCLC who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgical resection.  This study involves adding fresolimumab to the above standard treatment.  T he treatment is limited to three IV administrations of the 
medication, at the dose that is anticipated to be tolerable based on prior clinical trials.  We also structure the follow- up visits of the study to match those that would be needed following 
SABR treatment.  We believe with the above study design, we can increase patient 
acceptance and tolerability of the trial.

2. BACKGROUND  
2.[ADDRESS_1194167] often diagnosed at advanced  stages  [1]. 
However, early stage non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) is often surgically curable with the 
appropriate resection, preferably lobectomy [ 2]. Unfortunately, a significant fraction of patients 
with early stage NSCLC cannot tolerate surgery owing to medical comorbidities.  
2.2 Study Agent/Device/Procedure 
Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy 
In non-operable NSCLC patients, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy  (SABR), also called 
stereotactic body r adiation therapy (SBRT), has recently emerged as an important treatment 
option [3, 4].  A landmark prospec tive phase 2 clinical trial conducted by [CONTACT_169894], RTOG  0236, found that SABR resulted in outstanding local control  (LC) and 
overall survival  (OS) rates of 98% and 56% at 3  years in a cohort of strictly medically inoperable 
patients with peripherally located stage I NSCLC [5].  While extremely well tolerated, SABR 
almost always produces a significant fibrotic reaction in the targeted region of the lung.  These 
fibrotic reactions result in loss of function of the affected lung tissue and significantly complicate detec tion of post-SABR recurrences.  
Transforming growth factor -beta 
Transforming growth factor -beta (TGFβ) is a pleiotropic cyto kine expressed as three isoforms; 
TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and TGFβ3 and belongs to a superfamily of ligands comprised of more than 30 proteins  such as bone morphogenetic proteins, activins, and inhibin. TGFβ isoforms are 
involved in a number of normal biologic and physiologic processes such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell motility, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix production [ 6]. In 
normal non-cancerous  cells TGFβ limits the growth of epi[INVESTIGATOR_018], endothelial, neuronal, and 
IRB-[ADDRESS_1194168] growth promoting and prometastatic effects [ 7, 8]. 
TGFβ has been implicated in the growth, progression, and metastasis of cancer and is known to be a key mediator in epi[INVESTIGATOR_857240]; controlling key events such as the differentiation, proliferation, growth and senescence of cells.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], TGFβ suppresses the proliferation of 
cells and clear senesced cells through the induction of apoptosis  [7, 8].  These antiproliferative 
effects are primarily mediated by [CONTACT_857268]-dependent kinase inhibitors and suppression of c-Myc and in the absence of promitogenic gene mutations or other mitogenic 
stimuli,  disruption of TGFβ signaling does not induce cell proliferation.  However, work of 
numerous investigators has revealed that mutations in TGFβ receptors or its signal transduction 
pathways, which abrogate the cytostatic activity of the growth factor in epi[INVESTIGATOR_857241], play a key role in tumor progression of many types of cancer  [9].  
In addition, TGFβ has additional direct effects on tumor promotion by [CONTACT_857269][INVESTIGATOR_018] -mesenchymal transformation (EMT), a morphologic and functional change for cancer 
cells.  Cancer cells which have undergone EMT are much more motile and invasive which leads 
to increased metastasis  [10, 11]. 
In animal models, TGFβ has been implicated as a key regulator promoting the development of radiation-induced lung fibrosis.  In rodents, expression of TGFβ is induced after pulmonary 
irradiation and inhibition of TGFβ via monoclonal antibodies or small mol ecule inhibitors results 
in dramatically decreased development of fibrosis.  For example, in a study designed to determine if TGFβ neutralization ameliorates radiation-induced fibrosis in the lung, Fischer 344 rats were administered a single dose of 1D11 after receiving 5 fractionated doses of 
radiation.  Results demonstrated that a single dose of anti -TGFβ antibody significantly reduces 
inflammation, TGFβ activation and expression, and radiation-induced fibrosis
 [12].  Additionally, 
TGFβ  inhibition has been show to radiosensitize various types of cancer cells.  For example, in 
studies involving syngeneic murine breast cancer and glioblastoma models TGFβ neutralization using a anti -TGFβ monoclonal antibody  resulted in tumor growth delay  [13, 14].  This suggests 
inhibition of TGFβ  may be of therapeutic value in combination with radiotherapy. 
Description of Fresolimumab  Fresolimumab is a fully human IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody generated using recombinant 
technology in collaboration between [COMPANY_011]  Genzyme Corporation and Cambridge Antibody 
Technology (Cambridge, [LOCATION_006]).  Fresolimumab is capable of neutralizing all mammalian isoforms 
of TGFβ (ie, β1, β2, and β3).  Fresolimumab is a high-affinity antibody with dissociation 
constants  (Kd) of 1.8 nM, 2.8 nM, and 1.4 nM for TGFβ1;  TGFβ 2, and TGFβ 3, respectively.  
Fresolimumab has entered clinical trials, including a recently completed multi -institutional 
phase 1 trial (NCI -06-C- 0200) in patients with advanced malignant melanoma and renal cell 
cancer.  It is also being evaluated as an anti -fibrotic agent in patients with fibrotic conditions.  
IRB-[ADDRESS_1194169] in human, single-dose multi -institutional phase 1 study of Fresolimumab was carried out 
in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (clinicaltrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  No drug-related 
serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.  A single dose phase 1 trial of fresolimumab in 
patients with treatment resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (clinical trials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has also been completed. 
A phase 1 multi -institution, dose-escalation trial of Fresolimumab in subjects with metastatic 
malignant melanoma and renal cell cancer was the lead institution was recently completed 
(NCI-06-C-0200). This protocol represented the first study of Fresolimumab in patients with 
cancer and the first to involve repeated doses of the antibody.  Cohorts of patients with 
advanced malignant melanoma and renal cell cancer that had failed at least 1 prior therapy were treated with intravenous Fresolimumab administered at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 or 15 mg/kg in a 
3 + [ADDRESS_1194170] dose (Day  0), 3 additional doses were administered 2 weeks apart (Days 28, 42 and 56).  
Patients achieving at least stable disease or better by [CONTACT_857270] [ADDRESS_1194171] dose level determined to be safe at the time every 2 weeks for up to 2 additional courses.  Twenty -two 
patients (21 with melanoma and one renal cell cancer patient) were treated in the initial 
dose-escalation component of the study and an additional 7 patients (all with malignant 
melanoma) were treated in a safety cohort expansion at the highest dose of 15 mg/kg.  
No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and the highest dose level of Fresolimumab, 
15 mg/kg, was determined to be safe.   
Evidence of clinical benefit (SD or better) was seen in 7 of 29 (24%) total patients enrolled in the 
study: PR (N  = 1), SD (N  = 3) and MR (N  = 3).  Two of these [ADDRESS_1194172] once at a 
minimum interval of not less than 8 weeks.  The remaining 5 responses  were observed in 
subjects receiving Fresolimumab at starting doses of 1 mg/kg or less.  Of these, 3 patients had mixed responses with shrinkage of metastases in the liver and at other sites, and one patient 
with skin disease achieved a PR with >89% reduction of target lesions lasting about one year.

12.5 Gy/fraction in 4 fractions between Days  8 and 12 to a total of 5 patients who will be 
evaluated for safety, and additional patients will be enrolled if specific AE’s are observed.  A dose reduction may be implemented if excessive toxicity is observed.  
Blood would be collected for pharmacokinetic studies (only Phase 1 ).  This is a 
single-arm, open-label study  
Phase 2 component: 
Up to a total of 60 patients, including the Phase 1 portion.  Fresolimumab will be

4.2.1 Fresolimumab Administration 
Fresolimumab will be administered IV at a dose of 3 mg/kg on D ays 1, 15, and 36, with 
SABR (-1/+5 days)  being administered at 12.5 Gy/fraction in 4 fractions between 
Days 8 and 12.  
    
Administration Schema:  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE] Page 19of 44 30 June 2022
Phase 1(see study Schema , pg 9):
We will enroll 5 patients at 3 mg/kg of fresolimumab.
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as the following grade 3; 4; or 5CTCAE v4 events 
determined to be of possibly; probably; of definite relationship to treatment; occurring after 
1stdose of fresolimumab and up to [ADDRESS_1194177] dose of fresolimumab:
1)Radiation pneumonitis, or
2)Bronchopulmonary hemorrhage 
Of the 5patients, if none experience DLT, then 3 mg/kg will be the dose for the Phase 2
component. 
If one patient experiences DLT, an additional 5 patients will be enrolled at 3 mg/kg. If no 
more patients experiences DLT, then 3 mg/kg will be the dose for the Phase 2component.  
If 2ormore patients experience DLT in the total expanded cohort (or 2 ormore patients in 
the initial cohort experience DLT), then the investigational dose of fresolimumab will be 
changed to 1 mg/kg.  If 2ormore patients in the initial cohort experience DLT before all 
5patients have been enrolled, the remaining patients will receive the lower dose of 1 mg/kg.
At the lower dose (1 mg/kg), 5 more patients will be enrolled. If no more patients experience 
grade 3 or higher toxicity, then 1 mg/kg will be the dose for the Phase 2component.
If one or more patients of 5 experience DLT at the reduced dose, the investigators will 
consider closing the study. Phase 2:
Fresolimumab will be administered IV at the dose determined from Phase 1on Days 1, 15
(+ 6 days) , and 36 (+/-6 days) , with SABR (-1/+5 days) being administered at 
12.5 Gy/fraction in [ADDRESS_1194178] be instructed not to take additional medications including over-the-counter products and herbal/alternative medications during the study without prior consultation with the investigator.
Permitted treatments during the study include, but are not limited to the following:
•Pain medication to allow the patient to be as comfortable as possible
•Nutritional support or appetite stimulants (eg, megestrol)
•Oxygen therapy and blood products or transfusions
The following concomitant treatments are not allowed during the study:
•Concurrent use of other investigational drugs is not permitted.
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 20 of 44  30 June 2 022 
 
 
 • The administration of other antineoplastic therapy (eg, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, 
immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and monoclonal antibodies) is  not permitted.  
 4.2.[ADDRESS_1194179];  6th; 9th and 12th month from end of SABR completion (+/- 2 weeks).  
History  and physical exam, ECOG PS, toxicity evaluation, CT Thorax (Chest) imaging, and 
labs will be evaluated at each of these visits.  Skin exams will be conducted at the 3rd month 
from end of SABR  completion. PFTs will be completed at 6th and 12th month. PET/CT 
imaging will be evaluated at 6th month. The duration of the treatment phase of the study will 
be through the 1st follow -up visit, approximately 90 days after the SABR is completed.  
4.2.4 Duration of Follow -Up 
The follow -up portion of the study will begin approximately 90 days after SABR is completed 
through 12 months from enrollment.  Further follow-up information is on the study calendar .  
4.2.5 Criteria for Removal from Study Patients who develop the following conditions during the course of treatment will discontinue further planned study treatments (fresolimumab or SABR).  Long-term follow-up visits will 
still be performed as feasible unless patient completely withdraws consent (treatment and follow up). 
• Disease progression by [CONTACT_857271] 
• Unacceptable toxicity  (Section 7.12) 
• Pregnancy  
• Patient request for no further treatment 
• Noncompliance 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Inability of subject to comply with study requirements  
• Any general or specific changes in the patient’s condition that render further treatment 
unacceptable in the judgment of the investigator  
4.2.6 Alternatives 
Alternative treatments include surgical resection, SABR alone, or no therapy. 
4.2.7 Compensation 
Patients will not be paid for their participation in the study.   
4.3. Procedures: SABR Administration and Radiation Treatment Planning  
4.3.1. Fiducials 
We may implant peri -tumoral metallic fiducial markers for image-guided tumor localization as 
needed, generally for lower lobe locations where the magnitude of tumor motion tends to be greatest.  The fiducials will be used as surrogates for targeting the daily tumor position during 
treatment.  The fiducials will be placed directly into the tumor and/or periphery under CT guidance.  Fiducials may be implanted prior to enrollment as this is  a standard of care 
procedure for any patient receiving SABR for lung tumors. 
4.3.2. Simulation 
During radiotherapy simulation, customized immobilization devices will be formed for each 
patient, and 4-dimensional  CT ([ADDRESS_1194180]) will be acquired in the treatment posi tion.  Acquisition of 
a PET-CT in the treatment position is encouraged but not required. 
4.3.3. Treatment planning 
The treating physicians will contour the gross tumor volume (GTV) on axial CT slices using lung 
windows for visualizing tumor/lung interfaces and mediastinal windows for tumor/soft tissue 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 21 of 44  30 June 2 022 
 
 
 interfaces, with the aid of fused PET.  No explicit expansion for microscopic extension will be 
added to form the clinical target volume (CTV), ie, CTV = GTV.  Breathing-induced tumor 
motion will be assessed using the 4-D CT data and managed by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_125344], dynamic 
tumor tracking, or motion-inclusive technique, and the internal target volume (ITV) will be 
designed accordingly.  A 0.5 cm setup margin will be added to the ITV to form the final planning 
target vol ume (PTV).  
Treatment will be delivered using 6 or 10 MV photons using a linear accelerator with daily kilovoltage (kV) X-ray portal imaging and/or daily cone-beam CT for anatomy -based matching.  
4.3.4. Dosimetry  
Treatment can be planned using forward or inverse planning.  In the case of the former, 
three-dimensional coplanar or non-coplanar beam arrangements will be custom designed for each case to deliver highly conformal prescription dose distributions.  For forward planned 3D 
conformal RT, when static beams ar e used, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] ≥  10 (at least 7) non-opposing, 
non-coplanar beams of radiation will be used with roughly equal weighting.  Generally, more 
beams are used for larger lesion sizes.  Alternatively, dynamic conformal arcs (coplanar or 
non-coplanar) may be used.  In order to obtain acceptable coverage, field aperture size and 
shape should correspond nearly identically to the projection of the PTV along a beam’s eye view (ie, no additional “margin” for dose buildup at the edges of the blocks or MLC jaws beyond the 
PTV).  For inverse planning, volumetric modulated arc therapy or fixed beam IMRT will be 
performed.  In all cases, the treatment isocenter will be adjusted based on pre-treatment 
imaging.  
For purposes of dose planning and calculation of monitor units  for actual treatment, this protocol 
will require tissue density heterogeneity corrections with algorithms that accurately model 
buildup and lateral electron scatter (eg, Monte Carlo, AAA, Acuros XB, 
superposition-convolution).  Simple pencil beam algorithms are not acceptable.  
4.3.5. Prescription dose constraints 
For all subjects, the decision of whether a treatment plan is acceptable will be made on a 
case -by-case basis by [CONTACT_174634].  Successful  treatment planning will 
require accomplishment of all of the following criteria:  
1.  P
rescription dose:  The prescription dose will be 50 Gray  (Gy) in four 12.5 Gy fractions.  
2.  Maximum dose: The treatment plan should be created such that 100% corresponds to 
the prescription dose.  The maximum d ose for the pl an must be at least 110% and 
no more than 140% and this point must be located within the PTV and ideally within the 
GTV.  A maximum dose of 120 to 130% of the prescription dose centered in the GTV 
would be typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855].  
3.  Planning Target Volume Coverage: 95% of the target volume ( PTV) must be 
conformally covered by [CONTACT_349121] (PTV V100%RX  ≥ 95%) and 
99% of the target volume (PTV) receives a minimum of 90% of the prescription dose 
(PTV V90%RX > 99%).  
4.  High Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]: The cumulative volume of all tissue outside the PTV receiving a 
dose > 105% of prescription dose should be no more than 15% of the PTV volume.  The 
ratio of the volume receiving greater than or equal to the prescription dose to the PTV 
volume should ideally  be < 1.2 (see table below).  These will not be required to be met in 
treating small tumors (< 2.5 cm axial GTV dimension or < 1.5 cm craniocaudal GTV 
dimension) in which the required minimum field size of 3.5 cm results in the inability to 
meet a conformality ratio of 1.2.  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 22 of 44  30 June 2 022 
 
 
 5.  Intermediate Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]: The falloff gradient beyond the PTV extending into normal 
tissue structures must be rapid in all directions and meet the following criteria: 
a. Loc ation: The maximum total dose over all fractions in Gy to any point 
[ADDRESS_1194181] be no greater than is given 
by [CONTACT_30557].  
b. Volume: The ratio of the volume of 50% of the prescription dose isodose to the 
volume of the PTV must be no greater than is given in the table below.

4.3.6. Prescription dose constraint tables 
The following tables list dose constraints to critical structures based on the number of fractions prescribed. Exceeding these dose limits by [CONTACT_726] 5% constitutes an unacceptable protocol deviation.

5. INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT INFORMAT ION:  Fresolimumab 
5.1  Description/Mechanism of Action   
Fresolimumab is an engineered human IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing all mammalian isoforms of TGFβ (ie, TGF β1;  TGFβ2 ;  and TGFβ 3).  Fresolimumab is a 
high-affinity antibody.  
The structural formula for fresolimumab is depi[INVESTIGATOR_48393]: 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1194182] been characterized in patients with advanced 
malignant melanoma and RCC, IPF, and FSGS in Phase 1 trials following single and multiple IV 
doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg.  Toxicology studies at doses of 0.1 to 50 mg/kg 
have been conducted in non-human primates and generally have had exposures 10-fold lower 
than the exposure levels seen with the corresponding dose in humans.

important covariate using a full allometric model.  Over the range of body weights of 
50 to 100 kg, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_857243] 30%.  There was no 
difference in the PK behavior of fresolimumab based on patient disease.  No other covariates 
were identified as being predictive of PK variability. 
5.3 How Supplied/Storage 
Fresolimumab is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder intended to be reconstituted with 
5.1 mL of sterile Water for Injection (sWFI).  The composition of the lyophilized powder is listed 
below: 
 
Prior to administration, lyophilized fresolimumab will be reconstituted with 5.1 mL (50 mg vial) of 
sWFI to result in a protein concentration of approximately 10 mg/mL in a 50 mM sodium 
phosphate buffer at pH 7.1, containing 25 mM sodium chloride, 3%  mannitol, 1%  sucrose, and 
0.01%  polysorbate 80.  Filter needles must not be used to remove reconstituted drug product 
from the vial.  However, due to the nature of proteins and their ability to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], the use of a 
0.[ADDRESS_1194184] (diluted as a 
solution for infusion).  The composition of reconstituted fresolimumab is listed below:  
IRB-[ADDRESS_1194185] is stored in clear glass vials of 5 mL capacity  (nominal), which meet the 
USP standard for Type I  glass, closed by a siliconized butyl rubber stopper. 
Fresolimumab vials must be stored at 2 to 8°C or 35.6 to 46.4°F until preparation for infusion.  
Reconstituted fresolimumab is stable for up to 24 hours  after reconstitution with sWFI at either 
room temperature or under refrigeration (between 2 to 8°C or 35.6 to 46.4°F).  Although stable 
for up to 24 hours under these conditions, fresolimumab in sWFI should be used immediately.  
Reconstituted fresolimumab in sWFI that is further diluted in dextrose 5% in water at a 
concentration of 0.3 mg/mL to 7 mg/mL is stable for up to 24  hours at room temperature. 
Infusion bag should be administered over 30 mins using an intravenous infusion pump (through inline 0.22 m icron low protein binding filter). Fresolimumab should not be infused in the same 
intravenous line with other products.  
 
5.4 Manufacture 
To produce the antibody in sufficient quantities for clinical use, a mammalian cell line (derived 
from a murine myeloma) was constructed using the human deoxyribonucleic acid sequences for the anti -TGFβ antibody, selected by [CONTACT_857272], and the human IgG4 constant 
domains. This cell line enables manufacture of the human protein in large-scale fermenters.  The protein is purified, filled into glass vials, and lyophilized.  
All reasonable care is taken during production to maintain product quality and integrity. The purification process (including 3 chromatography columns with different mechanisms for removal of contaminants, a low pH virus inactivation step and a virus retentive nano-filtration 
step) provides for the clearance of process -derived impurities and potential microbiological 
contaminants resulting in low impurity levels. Virus clearance studies have shown that the process is capable of clearing enveloped and nonenveloped viruses (murine leukemia virus and 
minute virus of mice). Purified drug substance, formulated bulk drug, and finished drug product 
fresolimumab are tested for identity, purity, potency, and stability against a set of release specifications that ensure that the product is suitable for parenteral use in the clinic.  
5.[ADDRESS_1194186] demonstrated that fresolimumab is well tolerated at single doses up to 8 mg/kg in patients with IPF, at single doses up to 4 mg/kg in patients with FSGS, and at multiple doses up to 15 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 26 of 44  30 June 2 022 
 
 
 mg/kg in patients with advanced melanoma or renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  No dose limiting 
toxicities or acute infusion-associated events suggestive of cytokine release or hyper sensitivity 
have been reported, although infusion reaction could still occur . 
5.6 Contraindication 
There are no established contraindications to fresolimumab. 
6. DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
There will be no adjustments in radiation dose.  In the event a patient develops DLT prior to 
completion of SABR, efforts will be made to finish the remaining dose of radiation once the 
patient recovers adequately.  
Regarding fresolimumab, dose will be either administered on a given day or withheld.  If a 
patient develops dose limiting toxicity that has not resolved by D ay 15 and/or 36, fresolimum ab 
dose will be skipped for that dose number.

7.1.[ADDRESS_1194188] common adverse reactions reported from previous studies include fatigue, peripheral edema, nasopharyngitis, pustular rash, headache, bronchitis, diarrhea, and dyspnea.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Skin 
Based on the clinical experience to date, the main epi[INVESTIGATOR_857244], most notably keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma.  The development of these lesions appears to be related to both dose and duration of exposure.  Because of this potential risk, skin exams, evaluating for treatment emergent lesions such as KA and drug 
reactions should be performed in all patients receiving fresolimumab.  Patients who 
develop concerning treatment-emergent skin lesions should be referred to a 
dermatologic oncologist or dermatologist for evaluation within 2 weeks of reported 
symptoms . 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Acceleration of Neoplasia Available literature suggests neutralization of TGFβ does not cause de novo 
malignancies.  In advanced cancers, TGFβ  neutralization may ameliorate cancer 
progression; however, in certain settings such as in the presence of premalignant 
lesions, it is possible that neutralization of TGFβ may contribute to premalignant/malignant transformation.  Long-term studies to inves tigate any 
carcinogenic or mutagenic effects of fresolimumab have not been conducted.  Patients 
receiving fresolimumab should be carefully monitored for the development of 
malignancies. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bleeding and Anemia 
Across the clinical studies, the majority of bleeding adverse events reported have been 
mild, self-limited events of gum bleeding without associated gingival lesions and nose bleeding without discrete nasal lesions.  Anemia in the absence of bleeding was seen in 
some patients in all of the p hase 1 studies, but in the majority of cases was considered 
unrelated to study drug and could be explained by [CONTACT_147392].  
Patients should be carefully monitored for the development of anemia and bleeding while receiving fresolimumab.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mouth Sores 
A small number of patients treated with fresolimumab have experienced mouth or gum 
sores.  Most of the sores were mild in nature.  Patients should be examined for mouth 
sores while taking fresolimumab.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Modulation No evidence of significant immune dysregulation has been seen in clinical studies to 
date.  Herpes Zoster, transient vitiligo, and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_857245]/or hair 
have been reported before. 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 28 of 44  30 June 2 022 
 
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Reproductive Function The effects of fresolimumab on male and female reproductive function and/or fetal 
growth and development have not been investigated in formal toxicity studies.  
Fresolimumab is an antibody and is expected to be able to cross the placenta and enter the fetal circulation during pregnancy.  The effects of fresolimumab in this situation are 
unknown.  Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from clinical studies of 
fresolimumab.  Women who become pregnant or start lactating during the study will be 
discontinued from study treatment.  Sexually -active men or sexually active women of 
childbearing potential (last menstrual period within the previous 12 months and not 
surgically sterile) must use contraception or abstinence when being treated with fresolimumab. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdose 
Animal studies have not clearly identified any acute dose related toxic effects. In the 
event of fresolimumab overdose, the administration should be immediately discontinued 
and appropriate precautions should be taken.  
7.[ADDRESS_1194189].   
An adverse event is any  unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite).   
Changes resulting from normal growth and development which do not vary significantly in frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse experiences.  Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_857246], and onset of menses or menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time. 
If disease progression is noted during a protocol -specified reevaluation of the status of a 
patient’s cancer, and the progression is manifested solely by [CONTACT_857273]/or 
radiologic imaging, that occurrence of progressive disease will NOT be recorded as an adverse experience.  Progression of disease is not considered an adverse experience unless it results in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059].  
7.3 Reporting Adverse Events Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4. Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study specific Case Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will assess each Adverse Event (AE) to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed Consent, Protocol Document, or Investigator’s Brochure, 
and related to the i nvestigation.  All AEs will be collected from signing of informed consent 
through [ADDRESS_1194190] study treatment.  Prior to Day 1, only  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs, 
see below) deemed related to study procedures need to be collected.  All SAEs will be tracked 
until resolution, or until [ADDRESS_1194191] severe grade over the course of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_857247]. 
Laboratory events defined as worsening of the laboratory value by [CONTACT_857274]  v4 (Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4) grade or more from baseline value that 
meet the regulatory criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE) will be reported. 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 29 of 44  30 June 2 022 
 
 
 Note:  All deaths due to any cause must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to [COMPANY_011]  
Genzyme. 
7.[ADDRESS_1194192] or precaution that may be associated with the use of the drug should be reported as a serious adverse event.  
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Life threatening definition: An adverse event is life threatening if the patient was at immediate risk of death from the ev ent 
as it occurred (i e, it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more serious form 
might have caused death).  For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug-induced hepatitis could be fatal. 
Disability/incapacitating definition:  
An adverse experience is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a substantial 
and/or permanent disruption of the patient's ability to carry out normal life functions.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_857248]:  
An adverse event that results in emergency department admission greater than 24 hours or 
requires general in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a 
pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. 
7.5 Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
 Attribution of Adverse Events:  
Code  Attribution   Definition  
1  Unrelated  The Adverse Event is clearly not related to the investigational agent(s)  
2  Unlikely  The Adverse Event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s)  
3  Possible  The Adverse Event may be related to the investigational agent(s)  
4  Probable  The Adverse Event is likely related to the investigational agent(s)  
5  Definite  The Adverse Event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s)  
All subjects/patients with serious adverse experiences must be followed up for outcome. 
All adverse events are serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, ie, serious and 
unexpected adverse events that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug 
fresolimumab, will be reported to the FDA via IND Safety  Report [21CFR§312.32] within 
[ADDRESS_1194193]/patient treated on study or within [ADDRESS_1194194] Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) within [ADDRESS_1194195] DSMC  using the study specific case report form 
(CRF ) regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation. Following review by [CONTACT_6802], 
events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be reported to the IRB using 
eProtocol within [ADDRESS_1194196] attribution and grading system as 
specified by [CONTACT_472] (http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html , see table below).  
7.6 Special Considerations Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79467]. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse or transmission 
of an infectious agent via a medicinal product.  
Serious adverse events occurring after a patient is discontinued from the study will NOT be reported unless the investigator feels that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_13462] a protocol procedure.  Study -specific clinical outcomes of death because of disease progressi on 
are exempt from serious adverse event reporting, unless the investigator deems them related to 
use of the study drug.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621540] a serious adverse 
event.  
In general, serious adverse events assessed as clearly being due to disease progression and not due to study drug(s) should be excluded from adverse event reporting. However, in cases where the specificity or severity of an event is not consistent with the risk information, the event 
should be reported. 
7.[ADDRESS_1194197] DSMC:  
1. New information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, 
in terms of severity or frequency.  
2.  Complaints that are unresolved by [CONTACT_5051], or that indicate increased or unexpected risks.  
3.  Unanticipated adverse device effect.  New information about the effect on health or 
safety.  
7.8 Definition of an Unanticipated Problem    
Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others (UPs) are events (including 
internal or external events, death, life-threatening experiences, injuries, breaches of confidentiality, or other problems) that occur any time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_138669]:

 2. Related to the research procedures – caused by, or probably caused by [CONTACT_138684], or, if a device is involved, probably caused by, or associated with the device, 
AND  
3. Harmful – caused harm to participants or others, or placed them at increased risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).  
7.[ADDRESS_1194198] monthly and document the patient’s status until the pregnancy has been 
completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_011] Genzyme without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  If a male patient’s partner becomes pregnant on study, the pregnancy must be 
reported to [COMPANY_011] Genzyme.  The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission 
to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to [COMPANY_011] Genzyme.  
7.10 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol  
Overdose is defined as any dose more than 25% above the prescribed dose described in the 
study protocol. 
7.11 Reporting of Overdose to [COMPANY_011] Genzyme 
If an adverse experience(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of test drug, the 
adverse experience(s) is reported as a serious adverse experience, even if no other criteria for serious are met.  
If a dose of test drug or vaccine meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a 
non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse experience must be reported within [ADDRESS_1194199] finished treatment and completed 6 months of follow up. If a 
crude rate of >20% is observed, the study will be suspended to evaluate the likelihood of these toxici ties being caused by [CONTACT_857275]. If a crude rate of ≤ 20% is observed, the study will proceed to primary 
completion.  
 A
ll outcome data (toxicity and efficacy) will be reviewed every [ADDRESS_1194200] 10 subjects through 
6 months follow-up.  In the event that there are ≥  [ADDRESS_1194201] Cancer Institute Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).  If, 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 32 of 44  30 June 2 022 
 
 
 after review, the DSMC recommends proceeding with the study, the report of the safety review 
will be submitted to the IND, and FDA’s  concurrence will be sought before proceeding with 
enrollment.   
Similarly, development of new malignancies will be monitored for the first  10 patients through 
the 6 month follow -up time point [except keratoacanthomas / squamous cell carcinomas  (SCC) 
of the skin].  Keratoacanthomas and SCC are not included because these are known events 
that regress after discontinuation of fresolimumab therapy, per the Investigator’s  Brochure.  
These lesions will be referred to a dermatologic oncologist or dermatologist for evaluation, 
treatment, and monitoring, but will not be tabulated towards the criteria for enrollment pause.  
New malignancies are expected to be rare, and if more than [ADDRESS_1194202] access to this information.  Only the patients unique IDN will be used.  Specimens will be stored under the patient’s IDN.

assigned by [CONTACT_21128].  
Assessment of fibrosis  will be performed based on three previously -published scales by [CONTACT_857264], 
et al. [15]  In the phase [ADDRESS_1194208] of pat ients 
previously -treated with the same dose of SABR (50 Gy in four fractions) at Stanford in the 
absence of fresolimumab. 
 
Late Radiation Fibrosis Score (Pattern):  
Late CT changes will be defined as occurring at [ADDRESS_1194209] of:  
1) “M odified conventional pattern” of fibrosis characterized by [CONTACT_678325], volume loss, 
and bronchiectasis with or without GGO,  
2) M ass-like fibrosis characterized by a well -circumscribed focal consolidation limited to the 
tumor region but which is larger than the original tumor,  
3) “Scar -like fibrosis” consisting of a linear opacity in the tumor region with associated 
volume loss, or  
4) “No evidence of increasing density” including stable or regressing mass at the location of 
the treated tumor  with no or minimal GGO or only normal appearing lung tissue.   
 
Acute Radiation Fibrosis Score (Pattern):  
The categories of acute findings (occurring in the first 6 months after enrollment) will be:  
1)  D iffuse consolidation,  
2)  Patchy consolidation,  
3)  D iffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs),  
4)  Patchy GGO, or  
5)  N o evidence of increasing density.  The term “diffuse” will apply to abnormalities that are 
at least 5 cm in maximum diameter and which contain more than 50% abnormal lung.  
Abnormalities  not meeting these criteria will be termed “patchy”. 
Severity Score: 
We will assign an overall severity score of radiographic fibrosis  at 6 and 12 months after 
enrollment using the categories:  
1)  “Severe” (much more extensive than usually seen after SABR),  
2)  “M oderate” (changes that are commonly seen after SABR),  
3)  “M ild”/“minor” (unusually slight changes compared to what is normally observed after 
SABR), or  
4)  “None.” 
“Presence of moderate-to-severe fibrosis ” at 12 months will be defined as severity  fibrosis 
scores 1 or 2 (ie, “Severe” or “Moderate” ) .  This will serve as the primary endpoint for Phase 2. 
Pattern and severity of fibrosis at [ADDRESS_1194210] a scan within +/-6 months of the 12-
month time point will be excluded from analysis. Patients who develop inflammatory lung 
conditions unrelated to radiotherapy (i.e. pneumonia, ARDS, drug-induced pneumonitis, etc.) 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 36 of 44  30 June 2 022 
 
 
 will be excluded from the final endpoint analysis if the area of unrelated inflammation impedes 
scoring of fibrosis severity  of the irradiated lesion. 
Quantitative image analyses: 
Finally, we will explore quantitative image analysis metrics for evaluating radiation fibrosis. This will include analyses such as contouring the region of fibrosis and quantifying its volume relative to the total lung volume and/or the original dose distribution.  Similarly, FDG -uptake metrics will 
be examined on the follow -up PET/CT. 
10.[ADDRESS_1194211] by  [CONTACT_6492] -up imaging (lung protocol CT and/or 
PET-CT imaging) as outlined above.  Lung protocol CT scans (biphasic imaging, 1.25 mm cuts) 
and/or FDG PET-CT scans will be obtained at all follow -up intervals as described in the 
treatment calendar.  All subsequent scans (post-treatment) will be compared to the same 
pretreatment CT or PET/CT that was used in conjunction with radiation treatment planning.  
Patients will be evaluated for objective response at the follow -up intervals specified above.  
Response to SBRT will be assessed and reported according to RECIST Version 1.1 criteria.  
Evaluation of Target Lesions (Primary Tumor)  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of target lesion.  
Partial Response (PR)  :  t least a 30% decrease in the diameter of target lesion, taking 
as reference the baseline diameter. 
Progressive Disease (PD)  :  A t least a 20% increase in the diameter of the target 
lesion, taking as reference the smallest diameter on study (this includes the baseline diameter if that is the smallest on study ). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
diameter must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).   
Stable Disease (SD) :  N
 either sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest diameter while on study.   
Failure will be documented by [CONTACT_857276]/or PET/CT that leads to a change in management, including institution 
of systemic or local anti -cancer therapy.  Failures will be categorized as follows:  
Type of Recurrence  Description (after SABR treatment effects have subsided)  
Local Failure  
Primary tumor failure (PTF ) Appearance of residual tumor located within the extent of the 
primary targeted tumor.  
Marginal failure (MF)  Appearance of tumor ≤ 2 cm in any direction of the primary tumor 
or structures immediately adjacent to the primary tumor (lung/chest 
wall, mediastinum/diaphragm/spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]).  
Involved lobe failure (ILF)  Appearance of tumor >  2 cm in any direction of the primary tumor.  
Regional Fa ilure  
Non-primary lobe failure 
(NLF)  Appearance of tumor within another ipsilateral (non -primary) lobe.  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 37 of 44  30 June 2 022 
 
 
 Type of Recurrence  Description (after SABR treatment effects have subsided)  
Hilar node failure (HNF)  Appearance of tumor in ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.  
Ipsilateral mediastinal 
nodal failure (MNF)  Appearance of tumor in ips ilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal 
lymph nodes.  
Distant Failure  
Distant nodal failure (DNF)  Appearance of tumor in ipsilateral supraclavicular or contralateral 
lymph nodes.  
Distant metastatic failure 
(DMF)  Appearance of tumor deposits characteristic  of NSCLC metastasis 
(chest wall other than incision sites or immediately adjacent to primary, mediastinal structures/diaphragm, malignant pleural effusion/pericardial effusion), contralateral lung and/or other distant 
sites.  
Potential adverse events  will be monitored by [CONTACT_857260] -up visit, and 
scored using CTCAE v4 with type and grade.  
Post-treatment changes in pulmonary function will be evaluated by [CONTACT_857277], 6-month, and 12-month follow -up.  
Recurrence rate is determined by [CONTACT_857278].  
Progression -free survival  (PFS) is time  from time from study enrollment until the first 
documented date of disease progression.  
11. REGULATORY CONSIDE RATIONS  
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol ;  the proposed informed consent;  and all forms of participant information related to 
the study (eg, advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_193001] (SRC).  Any changes 
made to the protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by [CONTACT_31482].  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information to all participating investigators. 
11.[ADDRESS_1194212] Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be the 
monitoring entity for this study.  The DSMC will audit study -related activities to determine 
whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating 
procedures, FDA regulati ons, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may include review of the 
following types of documents participating in the study: regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility checklists, and source documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious 
adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of 
human subjects.  Results of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the 
appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed. 
11.3 Data Management Plan 
The Protocol Director, or his/her designee, will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate 
participant case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study.  Study -specific Case 
Report Forms  (CRFs ) will document treatment outcomes for data analysis.  Case report forms 
will be developed using REDCap database system and will be maintained by [CONTACT_857279]. CRFs will be kept in a locked cabinet, only 
accessible to the research team.

Patients who develop inflammatory lung conditions unrelated to radiotherapy (i.e. pneumonia, ARDS, drug-induced pneumonitis, etc.) will be excluded from the final endpoint analysis if the area of unrelated inflammation impedes scoring of fibrosis severity of the irradiated lesion.  
 
12.4.2. Analysis Plan 
Approximately 60% of SABR patients develop acute radiologic changes in the lung at 3 months 
[16].  Late 
radiologic  changes, reflecting fibrosis, are more frequent in SABR patients at 1 year 
[15]. Our  institutional experience revealed the presence of moderate-to-severe late radiation 
induced fibrosis in ~75% of patients  treated with SABR (50 Gy in 4 fractions)  via VMAT  
technique at 1 year. 
Primary analysis : The outcome of moderate-to-severe radiologic fibrosis  rate will be tested in 
evaluable patients  in a one-sample one-sided test of proportion comparing the observed rate, 
which is expected to be at most  58%, to the historically observed rate of ~75%.  The observed 
rate and the 95% confidence interval calculated using the exact method will be reported. 
Secondary analysis : Local control at 12 m onths will be estimated along with a one-sided low er 
95% confidence bound to allow an informal assessment of the null hypothesis that the 
proportion is larger than 80%.  Patients with distant progression before local failure will be censored one day after the last imaging study;  patients who die before local control will be 
c 
ensored at the time of death.  These definitions are used for comparability.  Cumulative 
incidence estimates for local failure and other failure type will also be presented. 
Time to event data (local control, PFS, time to progression)  will be evaluated using 
Kaplan-Meier estimates with 95% confidence intervals at multiples of 12 months based on 
Greenwood’s formula with a log transform.  Confidence intervals for median times to event, 
if relevant, will be constructed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.  
Proportions (eg,  proportion of patients with grade  4 or higher toxicity) will be estimated along 
with 95% exact confidence intervals.  Patient clinical and demographic characteristics will be reported with the appropriate summary statistic (mean, range, proportion,  etc.)  Adverse events 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_51753].  
12.5 Sample Size 
12.5.1 Accrual Estimates 
Number of Patients: 55 to 60 
In 2014, ~[ADDRESS_1194214] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  It is estimated that 
2 to 3 patients can reasonably be expected to accrue per month.  Accrual will occur over 
60 m onths.  
12.5.2 Sample Size Justification 
Phase 1: Post-SABR pneumonitis grade 3 or greater is expected to occur in ≤  10% of patients with stage 
I disease.  Based on this percentage, we propose to start out with a cohort of 5 patients at the 
pre-selected dose of 3 mg/kg of fresolimumab.  If one patient develops DLT, then 5 more 
patients will be enrolled at the same dose to make a total of 10 patients.  If no more patients 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 40 of 44  30 June 2 022 
 
 
 experience DLT, then the total percentage of patients experiencing DLT is 10% and is considered acceptable for toxicity.  
Phase 2: A sample of size [ADDRESS_1194215] 80% power to detect a decrease in the 
incidence of post-SABR moderate-to-severe fibrosis from 75% to 60% with a one-sided 
significance level of 10% .

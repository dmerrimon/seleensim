1.0 Background   
 
1.1 The new epi[INVESTIGATOR_703295], the overall rate of head and 
neck cancers (HNC) has steadily decreased in recent years (1).  However, the number of cancers within the oropharynx (tonsils, base of tongue, or soft palate) has seen a dramatic and unexpected 
rise within the past two decades. From 1988 to 2004, there was a 225% population- level increase 
in HPV -related oropharynx cancers (HPV+ OPC) in the [LOCATION_002] and the Centers of Disease 
Control project that oropharynx cancer cases will likely grow to 17,000 cases/year by 2030 (2). 
This rate of growth within a specific cancer type is unprecedented and has been described as an oncologic epi[INVESTIGATOR_703296] (3). 
 
1.2 Role of HPV in Oropharyngeal Cancers 
 
Much of the rise in oropharynx canc er can be directly linked to the oncogenic role of the human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV). Oral cavity and oropharynx HPV infections are now widespread within 
the [LOCATION_002] and upwards of 70% of the U.S. population are expected to have HPV exposure 
within thei r lifetime (4). While much of the population is able to clear an oral HPV infection, a 
subset of the population develops a persistent viral infection which eventually leads to oropharynx cancer over the course of many years.  HPV+ OPC now comprises close t o 80% of 
all oropharynx cancers while smoking and alcohol -related oropharynx cancers continue to decline 
(5).  As a result, the demographics of an oropharynx patient has shifted from a more elderly population with significant smoking related co-morbidities to a younger, healthier population 
which is expected to live for many decades if they are cured of their cancer (6).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_954888] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_703297]+ OPC patients can expect high rates of cure with standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], these  
treatments are also associated with high rates of permanently disabling toxicities.  The standard 
treatment for HPV+ OPC involves either seven weeks of daily radiation therapy (70 Gy) 
concurrent with cisplatin or surgery followed by [CONTACT_703321] (60 Gy) 
with or without cisplatin depending upon post -surgical risk factors. Both definitive 
chemoradiation and surgery followed by [CONTACT_703322] ≥3 toxicities rates 
of ~30% (9).  The most common of these toxicities include dysphagia requiring a permanent 
feeding tube, severe xerostomia which limits food intake and increases dental issues, 
osteoradionecrosis of the mandible requiring surgery or hyperbaric oxygen treatments, or neck 
fibrosis which severely limits range of motion. Among patients who do not have grade ≥[ADDRESS_954889] -treatment dysphagia and xerostomia are closely 
correlated with the total radiation dose received by [CONTACT_703323].  For example, a mean dose ≥26 Gy to the parotid glands is closely linked to long- term 
xerostomia while mean doses of ≥50 Gy strongly increases the risk for permanent swallowing 
difficulties (10, 11).  However, achieving these dose constraints with conventional treatment is problematic as standard definitive and post -operative radiation doses are 70 Gy and 60 Gy 
respectively.  Even modern treatment techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy 
 7  MC1675 
 
 
 
Template revised: 1/30/2012 
  
 
 (IMRT) and proton therapy may have difficulty in reducing this normal tissue radiation exposure 
as the structures in question often lie within the vol ume at risk for disease recurrence, hence are 
intentionally treated.  Issues with long term toxicity are particularly germane in the HPV+ OPC population as these patients will likely be cured, are healthier, and are expected to live a long time 
post- treatm ent.  This rapi[INVESTIGATOR_703298].  
 
1.4    Urgent need for novel treatment paradigms  
 
Strategies for reducing treatment toxicity for HPV+ OPC patients ha ve been identified as a 
research priority by a number of cooperative groups.  Nevertheless, these efforts are incremental in treatment de- escalation  and may not maximize the possible improvements in quality of life for 
these patients.  Furthermore, an incremental dose de -escalation strategy may ultimately be more 
dangerous than an aggressive de- escalation strategy, as salvage options for locoregional 
recurrences remain limited after [ADDRESS_954890] -therapy quality of life while potentially leaving 
salvage options available.  
 
1.5 Preliminary data supporting dose de -escalation 
 
After observing the limitations with current research philosophies, the Head and Neck Disease 
Oriented Group at Mayo Clinic adopted a novel philosophy towards the issue of dose de -
escalation.  Rather than incrementally de- escalating therapy (i.e. reducing radiation from 60 to 50 
Gy or changing the dose of cisplatin), we sought to aggressively de -escalate tr eatment using half 
the dose of total radiation (30- 36 Gy) along with one -fifth the dose of a gentler chemotherapy 
(docetaxel 15 mg/m2 x 2).    The accrual goal for MC1273 was [ADDRESS_954891] two years of follow -up.  The current 
locoregional control rate for MC1273 is 100%.  Three patients have developed distant metastases 
for a preliminary disease free survival rate of 96%, and no patients have died.  Furthermore, no 
patients have required the placement of a PEG tube following adjuvant radiation and the grade ≥[ADDRESS_954892] -therapy is 0%.  Although full conclusions cannot be drawn until 
follow- up is complete, preliminary data suggest a high likelihood that MC1273 will exceed 
expectations for both disease control and quality of life preservation. 
 
1.6 Inadequacy of pathologic risk factors  
 
The need for adjuvant radiation and/or chemotherapy after surgical resection is traditionally based 
upon risk factors found during pathologic assessment.  These factors include positive margins, 
extracapsular extension, lymphovascular space invasion, perineural invasion, tumor size, and 
nodal volume. Nevertheless, these pathologic risk factors are often poor predictors for 
locoregional recurrence.  A review conducted on Mayo Clinic HPV+ OPC patients who had risk factors after surgery but no adjuvant care found that only 20% of patients had a locoregional 
relapse, and only 11% of patients with risk factors but without extracapsular extension had 
relapse after surgery alone (12).  While these failure rates are still above traditional thresholds for 
 8  MC1675 
 
 
 
Template revised: 1/30/[ADDRESS_954893] -surgical tumor burden motivated the development of 
mate -pair sequencing for detecting HPV -associated gene rearrangements (13).  By [CONTACT_703324], mate -pair sequencing avoids the issue of variant calling errors associated 
with whole exome and whole genome techniques.  Combined with current ly available techniques 
for detecting circulating tumor DNA, mate -pair sequencing performed on the primary tumor 
specimen may allow for the detection of tumor specific genetic alterations which can be 
subsequently assayed in pre - and post- surgical serum samples (14-16).

The prescribed radiotherapy dose will be 30- 36 Gy in 1.5- 1.8 Gy twice -daily fraction size 
(total of 20 fractions). Radiotherapy should strongly  aim to begin on a Monday. If 
Monday therapy cannot be arranged due to Holidays or technical issues, treatment must 
start no later than Tuesday with chemotherapy arranged to begin on the same day.  
Treatments that begin on a Tuesday  should be Tues – Sat b.i.d. both weeks with 
chemotherapy to start on Tuesday both weeks.  The daily dose will be prescribed such that 100% of the PTV volume receives at least 30 Gy.  PTV coverage has precedence

 • Region -of-Interest (ROI) or “clip box” for fusion should be set to encompass 
the high dose PTV and adjacent spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]; if the supraclavicular region is a 
part of the target volume the ROI should extend to the C6 level; 
• If the fusion software allows the user to create an irregular ROI (e.g., ExacTrac), treatment room objects seen on in -room X -rays should be 
excluded from the registration;  
• Both manual (e.g., based on bony anatomy) and automatic types of registration can be used; the result of the fusion must be visually checked for 
the alignment of the bony anatomy, such as vertebral bodies and applicable 
soft tissue structures (e.g., optic nerves and/or optic chiasm).

7.512  Planning Target Volumes (PTVs): In general, the PTV should not go 
outside of the skin surface; if it does exceed the skin surf ace, the 
application of bolus material over this portion of the PTV may be 
considered but is generally not recommended.  
 7.513  PTV Expansion with Daily IGRT : The minimum CTV -to-PTV 
expansion is 2.5 mm (a larger expansion may be necessary for a target volume subject to significant intra -fraction variability.  In general, the 
CTV -to-PTV expansion (with IGRT) should not exceed 5 mm. 
 
7.52 Definition of Target Volumes:  
 
Patients randomized to Standard therapy  
 
7.520 CTV6000: This volume will receive 200 cGy per day. CTV6000 will include the primary tumor bed (based on preoperative imaging, 
preoperative physical exam/endoscopy, operative findings, pathologic 
findings) plus region(s) of grossly involved lymphadenopathy. This volume may approach the skin but should not approach < 2mm. It is 
recognized that after surgery, there can be considerable distortion of 
normal anatomy. If possible, map preoperative GTV(s) onto the 
postoperative radiation therapy planning CT scan, and add appropriate 
margins for microscopic  spread (1.5 -2 cm).  CTV 6000  also will include 
the involved  neck and/or dissected uninvolved neck at investigator 
discretion.   This generally means encompassing nodal levels 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_954917] the Principal Investigator,  
 
7.521 CTV5 400: This optional volume will receive [ADDRESS_954918] the Principal Investigator,   
 
7.522  Planning Target Volumes (PTVs): In general, the PTV should not go 
outside of the skin surface; if it does exceed the skin surface, the 
application of bolus material over this portion of the PTV may be considered but is generally not recommended.

CTV -to-PTV expansion (with IGRT) should not exceed 5 mm. 
 
7.53 Definition of Normal Tissues/Organs at Risk (OARs)  
 
7.[ADDRESS_954920]: The cord begins at the cranial -cervical junction (i.e., the top 
of the C1 vertebral body). Superior to t his is brainstem and inferior to 
this is cord. The inferior border of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_357319] T3-
4 (i.e., just below the lowest slice level that has PTV on it). The spi[INVESTIGATOR_703299]. In 
additi on, however, a Planning Risk Volume (PRV) spi[INVESTIGATOR_445153]. The cord_prv = cord + 5 mm in each dimension. This is 
irrespective of whether or not IGRT is used.  
 
7.532  Brainstem: The inferior most portion of the brainstem is at the cranial -
cervi cal junction where it meets the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. For the purposes of this 
study, the superior most portion of the brainstem is approximately at the level of the top of the posterior clinoid. The brainstem shall be defined 
based on the treatment planning CT scan. In addition, however, a 
Planning Risk Volume (PRV) brainstem shall be defined. The 
brainstem_prv = brainstem + 3 mm in each dimension. 
 
7.533  Lips and Oral Cavity: These should be contoured as 2 separate structures 
as the goal is to keep the lip dose much lower than the oral cavity dose. 
The definition of lips is self -explanatory. For non- oral cavity cancers, the 
oral cavity will be defined as a composite structure consisting of the anterior ½ to 2/3 of the oral tongue/floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, and  
palate.  This should not overlap the PTVs. 
 7.534  Parotid Glands: Parotid glands will be defined based on the treatment 
planning CT scan.  Parotid gland volume will not include any portion of 
any of the CTVs, although they can overlap the PTVs. 
 7.535  Constrictors : This will be defined as the posterior pharyngeal wall plus 
adjacent constrictor muscles. This extends from the superior constrictor 
region (the inferior pterygoid plates level) to the cricopharyngeal inlet 
(posterior cricoid cartilage level). T his should not overlap the PTVs. 
 7.526  Esophagus: This will be defined as a tubular structure that starts at the bottom of constrictors and extends to the thoracic inlet. 
 7.527  Larynx: This will be defined as a “triangular prism shaped” volume that 
begins just inferior to the hyoid bone and extends to the cricoid cartilage 
inferiorly and extends from the anterior commissure to include the 
arytenoids. This includes the infrahyoid and suprahyoid epi[INVESTIGATOR_24050]. 
 
 18  MC1675 
 
 
 
Template revised: 1/30/2012 
  
 
 7.528  Mandible: This includes the entire boney  structure of the mandible from 
the TMJ through the symphysis. It is recognized that for oropharynx 
cancers, this may overlap with PTV s. 
 
 
7.6 Treatment Planning and Delivery  
 
7.61  Management of the Low Neck/Supraclavicular Region (No Match)  
No Match: The  entire clinical target volume (CTV) [upper and lower neck and 
primary tumor bed] is irradiated with IMRT. There is no match line between 
upper and lower portions of the regions at risk. In this technique, limiting 
radiotherapy dose to organs at risk (OARs ), e.g., the cervical esophagus, is 
entirely achieved by [CONTACT_445181].  
 
7.62  IMRT Dose Prescription to PTVs  
See Section 7.5 for definitions of CTVs and PTVs.  For inverse planning IMRT, 
the goal is for 98% of the PTV s to receive ≥ 100% of prescription dose .  It is 
recognized that portions of the PTV close to the skin may receive significantly 
less than prescription. This is acceptable as long as cold spots within PTV do not 
exist at a depth deeper than [ADDRESS_954921] to investigator clinical discretion.  
 
For patients randomized to DART: 
 
7.[ADDRESS_954922] : The cord_prv should not exceed 35 Gy to any volume in 
excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). The spi[INVESTIGATOR_703300] 30 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.01 cc.  The 
goal for treatment planning will be a mean dose < 20 Gy. 
 7.632  Brainstem : The brainstem_prv should not exceed 35 Gy to any volume in 
excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). The goal for 
treatment planning will be a mean dose < 20 Gy. 
 
 
 19  MC1675 
 
 
 
Template revised: 1/30/2012 
  
 
 7.634  Lips: Reduce the dose as much as possible. The mean dose should be < 
15 Gy.  
 
7.635  Oral Cavity: Reduce the dose as much as possible. The mean dose 
should be < 20 Gy. 
 
7.636  Parotid Glands : In most cases, it will be easier to spare one parotid than 
the other. The treatment planning goal will be for this individual parotid 
gland to receive a mean dose of < 10 Gy. Otherwise, the goal will be for 
the total  mean parotid dose to be < 15 Gy. 
 7.637  Submandibular Glands:   If either submandibular gland is outside of the 
target volume, the goal will be for a mean dose for that gland to be <20 
Gy.  Otherwise reduce the dose as much as possible.  
 7.637 Constrictors : Reduce the dose as much as possible.  Target mean dose is 
<20 Gy. 
 7.638  Esophagus : Reduce the dose as much as possible. Target mean dose is 
<20 Gy. 
 
7.639  Larynx : Reduce the dose as much as possible. Target mean dose is <15 
Gy. 
 7.640  Mandible: Reduc e the dose as much as possible. Keep 105% hotspot 
outside of mandible if possible. 
 
 
For patients randomized to Standard Therapy: 
 
7.[ADDRESS_954923]: The cord_prv must  not exceed 45 Gy to any volume in 
excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm).  
 7.642  Brainstem : The brainstem_prv   must  not exceed 54 Gy to any volume in 
excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm).  
 7.643  Lips: Reduce the dose as much as possible. The mean dose should be < 
20 Gy.  
 7.644  Oral Cavity: Reduce the dose as much as possible. The mean dose 
should be < 50 Gy.  
 
7.645  Parotid Glands : In most cases, it will be easier to spare one parotid than 
the other. The treatment planning goal will be for this individual parotid 
gland to receive a mean dose of < 26 Gy. Oth erwise, the goal will be for 
the total mean parotid dose to be < 39 Gy.

The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version [ADDRESS_954925] access to a copy of the CTCAE, v. 4. 
A copy of the CTCAE, v. 4 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov
). 
 Grade 3 therapy- induced mucositis and/or dysphagia are expected to develop in about 
one third of patients  receiving  standard of care. Nutritional evaluation prior to the 
initiation of therapy, to determine if prophylactic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is needed, is highly recommended. Placement of a feeding tube should be recorded on the 
appropriate case report form, as should use of a feeding tube during and after treatment 
(e.g., greater than or less than 50% of nutrition by [CONTACT_181616]).   
Other common radiation adverse events include: fatigue, weight loss, regional alopecia, 
xerostom ia, hoarseness, transient ear discomfort, dysgeusia, dysphagia, odynophagia, 
skin erythema, and desquamation within the treatment fields.  
 Less common long- term treatment adverse events include: hypothyroidism, loss of 
hearing, chronic swallowing dysfunction requiring permanent feeding tube, and cervical fibrosis.  
 
Much less common radiation adverse events include: mandibular osteoradionecrosis      
(< 5% incidence with attention to dental recommendations), and cervical myelopathy     
(< 0.1% with restrict ion of spi[INVESTIGATOR_181586] ≤ 30 Gy). 
 
Clinical experience on MC1273 demonstrated an unexpectedly high rate of thrush in 
patients receiving DART.  Thrush prophylaxis is highly recommended for patients 
randomized to DART starting on Day 8 of therapy .  For full details of recommended 
symptomatic management for patients randomized to DART, please see Appendix  
VII 
 
7.82 Definition of Adverse Event Timing and Attribution  
 
  Early onset  (acute) toxicities will be defined as toxicities which begin during the start of 
adjuvant  therapy upwards to [ADDRESS_954926] radiation therapy. 
 
  Late onset  (chronic) toxicities will be defined as toxicities which begin from [ADDRESS_954927]  both an acute and chronic toxicity. 
 22  MC1675 
 
 
 
Template revised: 1/30/2012 
  
 
  
  Attribution  for toxicities will follow the guidelines outlined in section 10.22.  For 
statistical purposes, only grade 3 or higher toxicities recorded as “ possible”, probable” or 
“definite” in relationship to adjuvan t therapy  will be used for the primary endpoint.  For 
example, a patient who requires PEG placement after surgery, before the initiation of 
radiation therapy, and does not have  worsening of swallowing outcomes on formal 
swallow evaluation after adjuvant th erapy will be recorded as having a toxicity that is not 
probable or definite in attributable to adjuvant therapy for the purposes of the primary 
endpoint.  These toxicities will nevertheless be recorded for safety and reporting 
purposes. 
   When ambiguity exists concerning the attribution of toxicities, an independent panel 
consisting of a radiation oncologist, ENT, and medical oncologist who were not involved 
in the patient’s care will assess attribution.

For patients randomized to receive standard chemoradiotherapy, cisplatin at 40 mg/m2 will be 
given intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes weekly on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of each 
week. (6 doses for a total of 240 mg/m2). Cisplatin can be given prior to or after the patient’s radiation on each day of chemotherapy delivery at the treating physician’s discretion. Cisplatin 
administration outside of these specified time points during radiation is only al lowed in the event 
of holidays or scheduling conflicts that do not permit drug and radiation delivery on the specific

10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring  
 
10.[ADDRESS_954939] (i.e. drug, device, biologic) in a patient or research subject. 
Serious  Adverse Event  - Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious 
problems/events can be well defined and include;  
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity 
• persistent or significant birth defect/anomaly  
 
And/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021] -
investigator may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or 
others, or substantially compromised the research dat a. 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as non- serious adverse events.  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] ) - Any 
unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the f ollowing three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may 
be physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased 
risk for the subject or others (including individuals who are not res earch 
subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - 
persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB 
reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the 
subjects or others, or substanti ally compromise the research data, AND 
• Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not 
already described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed 
in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem 
or event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its 
occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an 
increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or ev ent is "related" if it is possibly related to the research 
procedures.

Template revised: 1/30/2012 
  
 
 Preexisting Condition- A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the 
study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, 
inten sity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. At screening, 
any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities tha t meet the 
definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.

    10.22 Assessment of Attribution  
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s).  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s).  
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s).  
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s).  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a 
medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.

 10.31 Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Mayo IRB:  
 
The IRB requirements reflect the guidance documents released by [CONTACT_12198] (OHRP), and the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) in early 2007 and are respectively entitled “Guidance on Reviewing and 
Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and 
Adverse Events” and “Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs: Adverse Event Reporting – Improving Human Subject Protection.” 
 
10.311 According to Mayo IRB Policy any serious adverse event (SAE) 
which the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_205274] a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_658430] [ADDRESS_954943] learns 
of the problem/event.  
10.312 Non-UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] – the investigator reports problems or events that 
do NOT meet criteria of an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_703304]. The investigator monitors the severity and frequency of subsequent non- UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16104] . 
 
Consider the following information to collect when developi[INVESTIGATOR_703305].  
Example 
Information collected on the adverse event worksheet (and entered in the 
research database):  
• Subject’s name:  
• Medical record number:  
• Disease/histology (if applicable):  
• The date the adverse event occurred:  
• Description of the adverse event:  
• Relationship of the adverse event to the research (drug, procedure, or intervention):  
• If the adverse event was expected:  
• The severity of the adverse event: (use a table to define severity scale 1 -
5) 
• If any intervention was necessary:  
• Resolution: (was the incident resolved spontaneously, or after discontinuing treatment)  
• Date of Resolution:  
 
The investigator will review all adverse event reports to  determine if specific

14.4 Back
ground and Methodology 
  
14.41  Circulating C ell Free DNA (cfDNA): Several studies indicate that circulating cell 
free DNA (cfDNA) includes representation of key genetic alterations related to 
cancer progression or resistance to systemic therapy; these alterations include 
mutations of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., TP53 ) and oncogenes (e.g., PIK3CA , 
KRAS and BRAF). Commercially available platforms exist with a predefined set of 
genes and point mutations of interest for use across multiple malignancies. A more 

 34  MC1675

 flexible system for individualized monitori ng is needed. Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster has 
developed an internal assay for this purpose.  
 
14.42  Immunogenic markers:  Given the immunogenic nature of HPV infections, we will 
investigate whether tumor antigen specific cellular immunity can serve as 
biomarkers for d isease progression.  Peripheral blood lymphocytes, cytokines, and 
chemokines from post -surgery, pretreatment, and post treatment samples will be 
correlated with disease recurrence, DFS, and OS.  
 
 15.0 Drug Information   
 
15.1 Docetaxel (Taxotere®, TATER) Commercial Supply  
 
15.11 Background : Antineoplastic Agent, Antimicrotubular, Taxane derivative. Docetaxel 
promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers, and inhibits the depolymerization of tubulin which stabilizes microtubules in the cell. This results in 
inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Most activity occurs during the M 
phase of the cell cycle.  
 
15.12 Formulation : Note: Docetaxel is now available as a one- vial formulation in two 
concentrations: 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL. The older formulation included 2 vials 
which consisted of a concentrated docetaxel vial and a diluent vial, resulting in a 
reconstituted concentration of 10 mg/mL. Admixture errors could occur due to the 
concentration difference between the new formulations of 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL 
and the old formulation (10 mg/mL). Do not use the two- vial formulation with the 
one-vial formulation for the same admixture product. 
 15.13  Drug  procurement: 
 
Preparation, storage, and stability: Storage conditions :
  Store the packaged 
docetaxel be tween 2 and 25° C (36 and 77 °F).  Retain in the original package to 
protect from bright light. Freezing does not adversely affect the product. 
 
One-vial formulation:  Note: One -vial formulation is available in two 
concentrations: 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL. Further reconstitution with diluent is not 
required. Further dilute for infusion in 250- 500 mL of NS or D 5W in a non- DEHP 
container (e.g., glass, polypropylene, polyolefin) to a final concentration of 0.3-0.74 
mg/mL. Gently rotate to mix thoroughly. Solutions prepared from the one -vial 
formulation and diluted for infusion should be used within 4 hours of preparation (infusion should be completed within 4 hours). 
 Two -vial formulation:  Vials should be diluted with 13% (w/w) ethanol/water 
(provided with the drug) to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Do not shake. Further dilute for infusion in 250- 500 mL of NS or D
5W in a non- DEHP container (e.g., 
glass, polypropylene, polyolefin) to a final concentration of 0.3- 0.74 mg/mL. Gently 
rotate to mix thoroughly. Diluted  solutions of the two -vial formulation are stable in 
the vial for 8 hours at room temperature or under refrigeration. Solutions prepared 
with the two -vial formulation and diluted for infusion in D 5W or NS are stable for up 
to 4 weeks (Thiesen, 1999) at room temperature of 15ºC to 25ºC (59ºF to 77ºF) in 
 35  MC1675 
 
Template revised: 1/30/2012 
 
 
 
 polyolefin containers; however, the manufacturer recommends use within 4 hours 
(infusion should be completed within 4 hours). 
 
15.14 Administration:   Administer IV infusion over 1 -hour through non- absorbing 
polyethylene lined (non- DEHP) tubing; in- line filter is not necessary. Note:  
Premedication with dexamethasone is required (see Section 7.0) 
  15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : Docetaxel exhibits linear pharmacokinetics at 
the recommended dosage range.  
Distribution:  Extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding; V
d: 
80-90 L/m2, V dss: 113 L (mean steady state)  
Protein binding:  ~94% to 97%  
Metabolism:  Hepatic; oxidation via CYP3A4 to metabolites  
Half -life elimination:  Terminal: ~11 hours 
Excretion : Feces (~75%, <8% as unchanged drug); Urine (<5%)  
  15.16 Potential Drug Interactions:   
Cytochrome P450 Effect: Substrate  (major) of CYP3A4; Inhibits  CYP3A4 
(weak).  
Increased Effect/Toxicity: CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the levels/effects 
of docetaxel. Concomitant use of docetaxel with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided. If systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor 
cannot be avoided, a 50% reduction in docetaxel dose should be considered along with close monitoring for docetaxel t oxicity. Refer to the package insert 
or LexiComp
1 for example inhibitors. When administered as sequential 
infusions, observational studies indicate a potential for increased toxicity when 
platinum derivatives (carboplatin, cisplatin) are administered befor e taxane 
derivatives (docetaxel, paclitaxel). Taxane derivatives may enhance the 
adverse/toxic effect of anthracyclines.  
Decreased Effect: CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the levels/effects of 
paclitaxel. Refer to the package insert or LexiComp1 for example inducers.  
Ethanol/Herb/Nutraceutical Interactions : Avoid ethanol (due to GI 
irritation). Avoid St John’s wort (may decrease docetaxel levels).  
 
15.17 Known potential adverse events:  Consult the package insert for the most 
current and complete information. P ercentages reported for docetaxel 
Monotherapy; frequency may vary depending on diagnosis, dose, liver 
function, prior treatment, and premedication. The incidence of adverse events was usually higher in patients with elevated liver function tests.

15.188  Drug is  a vesicant.  Monitor infusion site frequently for signs of irritation or 
infiltration.  Drug extravasation causes acute streaking, burning pain, and 
discoloration at the site.  Skin may be reddened for several weeks and 
occasionally blister and/or peel.  Reactions are usually reversible over time.   
Because of this central venous access may be necessary.  Discuss with MD if patient has poor peripheral venous access.  If docetaxel concentrate or diluted solution comes into contact [CONTACT_37381], wash with soapy  water 
immediately.  If it comes into contact [CONTACT_294600], wash with warm water immediately.

15.189c Instruct patient about possible facial flushing, rash, and skin and nail 
changes.  Monitor for signs and symptoms of hand/foot syndrome. However 
premedication with steroids can minimize this side e ffect.  Discuss with MD 
possible ways to manage itching and skin changes that may occur up to a week after docetaxel administration.  Advise patients that nails may crack, 
peel, or fall off all together. This may be a chronic toxicity.  Instruct patient 
to keep nails clean, short and to avoid wearing nail polish or artificial nails. 
 
15.189d In case of overdose, patient should be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_703309].

 15.2 Cisplatinum (Cisplatin®) Commercial Supply. Refer to the package insert for 
detailed pharmacologic and safety information.  
 
15.2.1  Formulation : Each vial contains [ADDRESS_954956] pH.  
 15.2.2  Mechanism of Action : The dominant mode of action of cisplatin appears to 
be inhibition of the incorporation of DNA precursors, although protein and 
RNA synthesis are also inhibited. Although this drug seems to act as an 
alkylating agent, there are data to indicate that its mode and sites of action 
are different from those of nitrogen mustard and the standard alkylating 
agents.  
 38  MC1675 
 
Template revised: 1/30/2012 
 
 
 
  
15.2.3 Administration : After administering appropriate antiemetics, cisplatin will 
be infused over 1- 2 hours or according t o institutional guidelines along with 
vigorous hydration.  
 15.2.4  Storage and Stability : Reconstituted solution of cisplatin is stable for 20 
hours when stored at 27°C and should be protected from light if not used 
within [ADDRESS_954957] with aluminum needles, producing a black precipi[INVESTIGATOR_160591] 30 minutes.  
 
15.2.5 Adverse Events: Human toxicity includes nausea, vomiting, 
anaphylaxis,neuropathies, ocular disturbances, renal t oxicity (with an 
elevation of BUN and creatinine and impairment of endogenous creatinine 
clearance, as well as renal tubular damage, which appears to be transient), 
ototoxicity (with hearing loss that initially is in the high -frequency range, as 
well as ti nnitus), and hyperuricemia. Much more severe and prolonged 
toxicity has been observed in patients with abnormal or obstructed urinary excretory tracts. Myelosuppression, often with delayed erythrosuppression, 
is expected.  
 15.2.6  Supply : Cisplatin is comm ercially available. The use of drug(s) or 
combination of drugs in this protocol meets the criteria described under

16.[ADDRESS_954959] two stratification factors (intermediate vs high risk and no vs yes smoking history) which 
will be used for randomization.  In addition to the primary statistical analysis, pre -planned sub -group analyses 
for each stratification factor comparing DART to standard adjuvant therapy will be independently evaluated for all the endpoints described below. 
 
16.1  Overview:   This phase III study will compare DART with standard adjuvant therapy .  
Standard therapy for this disease yields a 2 -year cumulative incidence of local/regional 
failure of approximately 10%, but it also has high rates of grade 3 or worse adverse events.  
Given the high rates of severe or worse adverse events (AEs), it is of  high interest to find a 
 39  MC1675 
 
Template revised: 1/30/2012 
 
 
 
 chemo/RT combination that can still yield low rates of local/regional failure with reduced AE 
rates.  Preliminary data from our phase II study, MC1273, suggests that local/regional control 
with dose de -escalated adjuvant radiation therapy (DART) is at least equivalent to historical 
control rates and rates of grade [ADDRESS_954960] treatment attributable to radiation therapy is 25%.  Based upon preliminary MC1273 
data, the rate of chronic grade 3 or higher late AEs ( > 3 months) after DART attributable to 
radiation therapy is around 2%.   
 
16.2 Late AE Primary Endpoint : 186 eligible patients ([ADDRESS_954961] treatment) 
will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_954962] 90% power to detect a reduction in the grade 3+ late AE rate ( > 3 months) from 
around 25% to 7%, with a 2- sided significance level of 0.05.   The hypothesis is that the 
DART treatment will reduce the grade [ADDRESS_954963] treatment.   Final analysis wou ld need p- value <= 0.[ADDRESS_954964] at two years following adjuvant therapy, we will assess AEs out to 2 
years.   
  
16.3 Total Sample Size:  This study will randomize 186 eligible patients ([ADDRESS_954965]).  To account for possible dropouts, cancellations, and ineligibles, we pl an to 
randomize 214 total patients (148 vs. 74)  and screen [ADDRESS_954966] accrual rate, we anti cipate being able to 
finish accrual in three  years.  Total follow -up for this study will be five years after completion 
of therapy.  Total study duration will therefore be for eight years.  
 
16.4 Secondary Endpoints: 
 
• To assess the cumulative incidence of l ocal/regional failure at [ADDRESS_954967] signed a consent form, and begun 
treatment will be considered evaluable for the 2 -year cumulative incidence rate.   
o The 2- year cumulative inc idence of local/regional failure will be estimated by [CONTACT_445185] (Gooley, et al.), where the competing risks are distant failures 
and deaths from other causes (i.e. deaths from distant failure or non -Oropharynx 
Cancer).   
 
o Local/Regional Failure Analysis for First 10 Smokers Randomized to DART: 
Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (MC1273) only included non- smokers for treatment with DART.  
Though published reports suggest that locol/regional control rates between smokers and non- smokers are equivalent following radiation therapy, the application of 
DART to a HPV -associated smoking population will nonetheless be novel.  The first 
10 smokers who are randomized to DART will be evaluated for local/regional control.  If three or more of these ten patients have a local or regional failure by [CONTACT_941] 
6-month post -radiation time -point, the radiation dose for this group may be modified.  
Accrual will continue while we wait for these first 10 smokers to be followed for a 
 40  MC1675 
 
Template revised: 1/30/[ADDRESS_954968] point (after first 99 patients enrolled): 
At nearly the halfway point for accrual (99 patients), we plan to conduct an interim 
analysis for the Local/Regional Failure rate in the DART patients.  At [ADDRESS_954969] -
treatment, we will estimate the local/regional control rate and if the confidence 
interval contains 95% for DART treatment, we will continue to full accrual.  The 
current sta ndard of care has a local/regional control rate of around 95% at 6-months.  
With 99 patients, we’d expect [ADDRESS_954970] 55 will be eligible for analysis.  With 55 DART treated patients, we’d need to observe an LRC rate of at least 86% (95% CI: 77 -95%) to continue to full accrual.   
 
• To compare overall survival, disease- free survival, and distant failure associated with DART 
vs standard treatment.   All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a cons ent 
form, and begun treatment will be considered evaluable for these endpoints.    
o Overall survival :  Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to 
death from any cause.  OS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, where 
the lo g-rank test will be used to compare the 2 treatment arms.  
 
o Disease- free survival :  Disease- free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from 
randomization to the first of either disease recurrence or death from any cause.  DFS will be estimated using the Kap lan-Meier method, where the log -rank test will be 
used to compare the 2 treatment arms.  
 
o Distant Failure Rates :  The 2 -year cumulative incidence of distant failure will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_445186] (Gooley, et al.), where the competing risks are local/regional failures and deaths from other causes (i.e. deaths from 
local/regional failure or non -Oropharynx Cancer).  
 
• Quality of Life (QOL): The patient QOL will be measured and compared between the 
treatment arms using the following tools:   1) Xe QOLS form, 2) Eq -5D, 3) FACT H & N 
(Version 4), 4)  Dermatology Life Quality Index; and QLQ H&N35 (see QOL Booklet).  These QOL measures will be assessed at baseline, [ADDRESS_954971] or the nonparametric 
equivalent to see if the QOL differs between treatment arms.     
o  NOTE: All survey responses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_703331].  If participants self -report negative social -emotional symptoms of 
depression while completing the initial or follow -up survey, a member of the study 
staff will share the responses with a member of the participants care team who will 
determine whether the individual should be referred for additional support.  
 
• Swallowing Studies :  Swallowing will be scored (yes, no) for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], penetration, 
velopharyngeal incompetence, epi[INVESTIGATOR_445165], tongue base retraction, and pharyngeal 
swallow response using the metric outlined by [CONTACT_445177].  (Eisbruch A, Teresa L,

16.5 Translational studies :  
• To determine the genetic alterations of oroph arynx tumor specimens and the 
detection rate of corresponding tumor DNA in the pre -surgical, post -surgical, and 
post-radiation blood of oropharynx cancer patients.   
 
• To investigate the usefulness of immunologic biomarkers in predicting progression 
free su rvival.  
 
• To establish a patient derived xenograft panel from representative oropharynx patients.  
 
 
16.6 Data & Safety Monitoring : 
 
16.61   The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least twice a year to identify accr ual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that might 
be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  The trial is monitored continually by [CONTACT_692025] 4 and 5 event in real time.  The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DS MB) is responsible for reviewing accrual and 
safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_31959].  Any safety issues requiring protocol changes are communicated 
through protocol amendments.   
 
16.62    Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:   The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_400596].  We note that the Adverse Event 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31921] (1) the study re-opening to 
accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in consideration of 
newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation.  The study team may choose to suspend accrual because of 
unexpected adverse event profil es that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
 
Based on data from previous studies, we expect about 20-25% of patients to 
experience Grade [ADDRESS_954973]-
treatment.  Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we 
observe adverse events that satisfy any of the following criteria for each treatment 
arm separately:  
 
• If at any time [ADDRESS_954974] 20  treated patients experience a 
Grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic adverse even t (at least possibly related to 
treatment).  
• If at any time [ADDRESS_954975] 20 treated patients 
(at least possibly related to treatment).  
• If after the first [ADDRESS_954976] been treated:  
o 40% or more of all patients experience a Grade 3 or 4 non -
hematologic adverse event (at least possibly related to treatment).   
 
 42  MC1675 
 
Template revised: 1/30/2012 
 
 
 
 o 10% or more of all patients experience a Grade 5 adverse event (at 
least possibly related to treatment).  
 
We note that we will review all Grade 5 adverse events on a case-by- case basis as 
well (regardless of attribution), and may suspend accrual after just one Grade 5 event, if we feel it is necessary for patient safety.  
 
16.7 Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activation, this study will have been 
regist ered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
(i.e., “Outcome Measures”) along with other required information for this study will be 
reported on ClinicalTrials.gov.  For purposes of timing of the Results Reporting, the initial estimated completion date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 60 months after the study 
opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” (PECD) for this 
study is when the last patient registered has been followed for at least [ADDRESS_954977] based on racial and gender groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], 
the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power for subset 
analyses.  
 
16.83   The geographical region served by [CONTACT_68281], has a population which includes 
approximately 15% minorities.  We expect abou t 15% of patients will be classified as 
minorities by [CONTACT_31961] 50% of patients will be women. Expected sizes of racial 
by [CONTACT_128777]:

18.82 Source Documents 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or 
other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the 
trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original 
documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_541120] e, microfiches, photographic 
negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the 
clinical trial. Source documents are kept in a secure location that is locked and requires approved access.  
 
18.83 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the 
study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be 
explained.  I f a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or 
the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual 
case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry 
error h as been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the 
incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  Do not erase or use “white -out” for errors.  For clarification of illegible  or 
uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  If the 
reason for the correction is not clear or needs additional explanation, neatly include 
the details to justify the correction. Note what the data management sys tem is that 
houses the CRFs.  
  18.84 Data Management  
 All data will be entered into electronic case report forms (eCRF’s) through the 
Medidata Rave system. Case report forms will be automatically rolled out based on a 
predetermined, and visit based schedule to improve study staff workflow and data 
quality. Data will be exported nightly to a secure FTP for analysis and reporting.

This study is funded through Mayo Clinic Institutional funds. 
 
 19.1 Costs charged to patient:  Routine clinical care  
  19.2 Tests to be research funded:   Research blood draws, Sample Collection. 
  
 19.3 Patient expenses which will be reimbursed:   
 
Adjuvant therapy with DART under our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (MC1273) proved to be extremely popular among both patients and outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_703312].  Many patients refe rred to the Mayo Clinic from distant 
facilities specifically for the purpose of participating in DART  on study.  Furthermore, many patients 
who would have been logistically unable to stay in [COMPANY_002]ster for [ADDRESS_954986] treatment translate d into additional costs and expenses for a caretaker as well.  
Although patients generally wish to stay at Mayo for the excellence of clinical care, the additional 
time, inconvenience and expense required from a prolonged therapy course were  more than many 
families could  logistically endure.   
 
Since the current trial  will be a randomized trial between DART (two weeks) and standard adjuvant 
treatment ( six week s), the logistical difficulties underlying a six week therapy course pose a particular 
challenge to the  standard course arm.  While out -of-town patients have historically demonstrated 
willingness  to logistically support a two week treatment, many out-of- town patients have also been 
historically unable to support a six -week treatment course.  If this pattern  continues on the current trial, 
we would expect that our six- week treatment arm will be overly enriched with wealthy patients who 
are able to afford staying in [COMPANY_002]ster for an extended period. Not only would this be unequitable for 
patients with lesser m eans, this self -selection would undermine the randomization process and disrupt 
the demographics of the study.

volume for standard therapy and 100% of the PTV volume for DART.  If the minimum dose falls 
below these parameters, an unacceptable deviation will be assigned.  The maximum dose for the P TV 
should not exceed 115%.  If the maximum doses exceed these parameters, an unacceptable deviation will be assigned.  
 
2. Radiation breaks, if necessary, should not exceed one treatment day on DART or two days on 
standard therapy.  Radiation breaks should be allowed only for resolution of severe acute toxicity 
and/or for intercurrent illness and not for social or logistical reasons. Any radiation break(s) exceeding one treatment day for reasons other than toxicity/illness /technical issues  will be considered 
a major protocol deviation.

 Appendix III  
 
Radiation Therapy Quality Control Guidelines  
 
 
1. Tumor Volume Coverage 
a. No deviation --  coverage + < 1 cm of specified. 
b. Minor deviation --  coverage + > 1 to 2 cm of specified or failure to cover tu mor volume + > 
1/2 specified margin. 
c. Major deviation -- > [ADDRESS_954990] and/or MRI scans available to assess 
treatment volume appropriateness (if not initially available should be requested) or failure to 
cover the target (tumor or tumor + edema) as defined in the protocol.  
 2. Isodoses - initial volume isodose plots are required on a minimum of three contours; one at central 
axis (CA), one superior to CA (2 cm below the superior field edge) and one inferior to CA (2 cm 
above the inferior fi eld edge).  Boost volume isodose plot required at CA. 
  a. No deviation --  isodoses submitted as required, and inhomogeneity across the target volume 
shall be no greater than + 5%. 
*b. Minor deviation --  isodose information incomplete or inhomogeneity across the target volume 
> 5 but < 10%. 
*c. Major deviation -- no isodoses submitted or inhomogeneity across the target volume > 10%. 
 * Deviations would occur only if isodose information is incomplete or not submitted after there has 
been a request to submit complete isodose information. 
 3. Normal Tissues  
 Normal structures are only to be included within the radiation field in as much as this is necessary to treat the primary tumor volume.  A minor deviation will result when normal structures are unnecessaril y included, but this is not felt to result in unacceptable toxicity that would interfere with 
the scientific aims of the protocol.  A major deviation will result when normal structures are unnecessarily included in the radiation therapy field and such incl usion is felt likely to result in a 
major increase in toxicity which would potentially compromise the scientific goals of the study. 
 4. Other parameters: (dose per fraction, total dose, overall treatment time and portal films).  
a. No deviation --  +/- < 5% of protocol specification. 
b. Minor deviation --  +/- > 5% to 10% of protocol specification. 
c. Major deviation -- +/- > 10% of protocol specification or incomplete data (i.e. no portal or 
sim films, etc.) available for review (after additional request has been made).  
 
5. Any individual minor deviation will result in an overall score of minor deviation; any major deviation 
will result in an overall score of a major deviation.  Multiple minor deviations will not add up to a 
major deviation.

Template revised: 1/30/[ADDRESS_955031] patients undergoing DART are essentially pain free 
during their two week therapy course, but rapi[INVESTIGATOR_268779] a fairly brisk mucositis lasting for about one week starting 
the day after completion of therapy.    
 
 □ Fungal prophylaxis  starting Day 8 (beginning of second week) of DART.  Fluconazole [ADDRESS_955032] 5 time s / day x 15 days. 
 
 
□ Prophylactic narcotic pain medication.  Most patients will be essentially pain free upwards to the day of 
completion of therapy.  However, a brisk mucositis generally emerges rapi[INVESTIGATOR_703320].  For this reason, it is recommended that all patients begin a prophylactic Fentanyl patch, 12 mcg, 
on the morning following the completion of therapy  (generally Saturday morning.)  Liquid oxycodone should also be 
available for breakthrough pain relie f.  Stool softeners and laxatives should also be used concurrently.  
 
 □ IV Fluids.  Even with prophylactic pain medication, most patients have approximately three days of poor oral intake 
because of the rapid onset of odynophagia / oral pain.  We recommend having IV fluid orders on hand for the first five days following the completion of therapy.

4.0 (2/2018)  p. 11 and 
26 Protocol Synopsis 
and Selection of 
Participants and Clinical sites  Reduce smoking pack years required for enrollment from 
20 to 10. The original protocol was based on 
preliminary data generated from the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453500] (NEJM 2016; 374:1811) where we demonstrated a 
high rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_453501]≥10 and smoking history ≥ 20 pack years but normal 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]. Twenty pack years was an 
inclusion criteria for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_453502]. Our 
4 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/[ADDRESS_578398]. W edzicha in AJRCCM 
demonstrates that at a threshold of  ≥[ADDRESS_578399] pathology begins at this smoking 
threshold (AJRCCM 2017;196:1021 & AJRCCM 20 16;193:662).

4 (2/2018)  p. 15, 27 
and 30 Protocol Synopsis, 
Study Hypothesis and Exclusion 
Criteria  Reduce FVC requirement from 80 % to 70 % predicted  Our choice to exclude patients with 
FVC<80% was based on inclusion 
criteria for the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453504]. Our 
goal was to exclude patients with other 
significant lung diseases, however we 
5 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/[ADDRESS_578401] found that the use of 80% is overly 
strict and excluding some patients, for 
instance, who are overweight.  In secondary analyses of the COPDGene 
cohort (similar to SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453503]) , isolating to 
subjects with FVC between 70-80% 
predicted demonstrat es similar 
statistically significant elevations in 
exacerbation rates and CT airway wall 
thickening in symptomatic GOLD 0 subjects as was seen in the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453505]. Therefore we propose to drop to 70% which we feel is 
still adequate to exclude significant 
interstitial lung disease.  
4/[ADDRESS_578402] 
was based on the FLIGHT 1 and 2 study 
protocol documents provided to us by [CONTACT_5343].  FLIGHT 1 and 2 were 
performed in order to obtain FDA 
approval for our study drug (Utibron: indacaterol/glycopyrrolate) in a COPD patient population.  Since the protocol 
was written, however, the drug was 
approved by [CONTACT_453553].  Several of 
the drugs prohibited by [CONTACT_453554] 
6 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/[ADDRESS_578403] in the 
protocol to exclude patients who would 
not be appropriate for the study such as active psychosis or asthma and therefore do not believe that easing these restrictions will result in inclusion of 
patients inappropriate for the study. 
4/2018  p. 35 -37 
and p. 38-
39 Screening/  
Enrollment and 
Schedule of events  Reduce post -BD time from 30 minutes to 15 minutes  The choice of 30 minutes was based on 
the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453506]-cholinergic. However, here we are using albuterol alone.  We note that the other 
PTC studies are using 15 minutes and 
therefore we propose to change this to reduce coordinator confusion and conform to the other PTC studies.  The 
ATS/ERS task force on standardization 
of spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (ERJ 2005;26:319) recommends [ADDRESS_578404].

RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 1. Background and Rationale  
1.1 Critical Knowledge pertinent to the lung disease and intervention  
Currently, COPD is defined by [CONTACT_453560] 1/FVC<0.7. In 2011, the GOLD guidelines were revised, 
recognizing that spi[INVESTIGATOR_453512]  (2). Instead, patients with COPD 
were divided int o four GOLD groups (A -D) based on symptom scores (using standardized questionnaires such 
as the CAT) and exacerbation risk. Groups A and B correspond to low exacerbation risk, with few symptoms 
(CAT<10 or mMRC<2) and more symptoms (CAT≥10 or mMRC≥2), respe ctively. Groups C and D correspond 
to high risk (GOLD stages 3/4, and/or  ≥2 exacerbations annually) with few symptoms (GOLD C) or more 
symptoms (GOLD D). The first choice for therapy in group B is LABA or LAMA. However, mounting evidence suggests that the spi[INVESTIGATOR_453513]. Indeed, 
accumulating data suggest that many current and former smokers with a “normal” FEV
1/FVC ( ≥0.7), manifest 
symptoms of COPD, disability due to those symptoms and clinically significant exacerbations  (3-5).  When 
carefully studied this group has evidence of occult airflow obstruction consistent with airway disease not 
detected by [CONTACT_453561][INVESTIGATOR_038]. These data suggest that many smokers with symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_453514] 1/FVC have chronic obstructive lung disease consistent with COPD, but do not fit current management 
guidelines. Because this population is large, the health burden posed by [CONTACT_453562]  (3).  Importantly, whether they would benefit from therapy is entirely unknown. A minority 
of them are already being treated in the community, but without guidance or evidence. The trial proposed 
here will test the following overarching hypothesis: current and former smokers with respi[INVESTIGATOR_453515] (FEV 1/FVC≥0.7) will derive benefit from inhaled bronchodilator 
therapy, even though they are excluded from the current GOLD guideline recommendations.  The 
clinical trial that stems from this hypothesis will provide new fundamental clinical and therapeutic knowledge 
regardless of the outcome. If these people do  benefit from symp tom-stratified bronchodilator therapy, then 
current guidelines for the management of COPD may require significant reconsideration. Such a result would 
call into question our very definition of COPD, suggesting that our current definition is insufficient to guide basic 
therapy in a large segment of our population. If these smokers with symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_453516] -stratified bronchodilator therapy , then this result too will provide important guidance 
for community physicians, given that many  patients in this group are already being treated. 
1.2 R ationale for Selection of Investigational Agent  
The GOLD consensus report  (2) and COPD Foundation guidelines  (6) currently recommend the use of long-
acting bronchodilators , used either alone or in combination,  as treatment for  patients with COPD with any 
severity of lung dysfunction who have symptoms  based on CAT≥10 or mMRC≥2.  Long- acting bronchodilators 
including the long- acting beta- agonist s (indacaterol, formoterol and salmeterol) as well as several long- acting 
muscarinic antagonists (tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], umeclidinium, and aclidinium)  which  are all currently FDA approved in the 
US as monotherapy for the treatment of COPD).  The FDA has also approved the use of dual bronchodilators 
which combine a long- acting beta -agonist  (LABA)  and a long- acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) for 
maintenance therapy in COPD.  These include AnoroTM (umeclidinium/vila nterol) and StioltoTM 
(tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]/olodaterol).  Indacaterol/glycopyrrolate is the dualbronchodilator  that we propose to test in our 
proposal, and it was recently FDAapproved .  Indacaterol/glycopyrrolate has rapid onset of action with 
sustained bronchodilat or effect over a 12- hour period and is administered twice daily . Its indication is the long -
term maintenance treatment of COPD including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.  
In clinical studies, both LABAs and LAMAs  appear to be effective for improving lung function in terms of FEV 1 
although the effects of combination LABA and LAMA are greater than the effects of either drug alone.  In the 
Flight1 and Flight 2 studies comparing indacaterol/ glycopyrrolate 27.5/15.6 mc g twice daily to indacaterol 27.5 
mcg twice daily, glycopyrrolate 15.6 mcg twice daily or placebo, the improvement in FEV 1 area under the curve 
from 0 to 12 hours ( AUC0 -12h) for the combination was superior to either monocomponent (p<0.001).  In 
addition, symptom improvement based on SGRQ and TDI scores as well as rescue medication use were also 
significantly greater in the combination treatment group as compared both to monocomponents and placebo 
(p<0.001).  
21 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/[ADDRESS_578420] and 
antimuscarinic in individual patients is observed, there are clearly individuals who respond preferentially to one of the two 
classes of bronchodilators (
Figure 1 ). This preferential 
response to beta -agonists or antimuscarinics may have a 
biological underpi[INVESTIGATOR_334], as differential responses have been associat ed with polymorphisms in the β2- adrenergic receptor 
gene (ADRB2)  (7). 
   
Hence in choosing a bronchodilator to test in this study, we chose a bronchodilator therapy with dual mechanism of action which is most likely to produce the greatest bronchodilation and 
symptom improvement in the most number of individuals, 
allowing us to best test the hypothesis that bronchodilation in 
symptomatic smokers will result in respi[INVESTIGATOR_453517].  By [CONTACT_453563].  
1.3 Prior Clinical Studies   
The core clinical development program for indacaterol/glycopyrrolate (tradename [CONTACT_453600])  is comprised of : 1) 
the recently -published Flight 1 and Flight 2 studies which were  two, placebo- controlled, parallel group,  12-week  
randomized studies to characterize the sa fety and efficacy of indacaterol/glycopyrrolate and 2) Flight 3, a 52-
week placebo- controlled study aimed primarily at establishing long- term safety of indacaterol/glycopyrrolate  (8, 
9).  Study populations were male or female greater than [ADDRESS_578421] -bronchodilator 
FEV
1/FVC<80% predicte d, FEV 1 ranging from 30- 80% and a minimum of [ADDRESS_578422] 6 weeks prior to screening.  The primary endpoint for Flight 1 and 2 was FEV
1 between 0 
to 12 h ( FEV 1 AUC 0-12h) after 12 weeks of treatment  with indacaterol/glycopyrrolat e as compared to the 
monocomponents indacaterol and glycopyrrolate.  Secondary endpoints included change in percentage of SGRQ responders (defined as individuals experiencing a 4 point drop in SGRQ) in addition to demonstrating 
superiority of indacaterol/glycopyrrolate co mpared to placebo in terms of FEV
1 AUC 0-12h, the transition dyspnea 
index (TDI) score, daily rescue medication use and daily symptoms as reported by [CONTACT_1629] e- diary at week 12.  [ADDRESS_578423] (CAT) was an exploratory endpoint.   
Pooled data from Flight  1 and 2 demonstrated statistically significant improvement in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h when 
compared to its respective mono -components in the pooled analysis (treatment difference [Δ] =103 mL and 88 
mL versus indacaterol and glycopyrrolate, respectively, p<0.001).  In addition, indacaterol/glycopyrrol ate 
treatment was significantly superior  to placebo for FEV 1 AUC 0-12h (Δ =246 mL, p<0.001).   
 
Patients treated with indacaterol/glycopyrrolate also had statistically and clinically significant improvement in 
their SGRQ total score at Week 12 when compared with placebo (mean 5.0 unit improvement, p<0.001) .The 
SGRQ total score also showed a significant reduction with indacaterol/glycopyrrolate treatment compared with 
indacaterol (p=0.019) and glycopyrrolate (p=0.033).  A significantly higher proportion of patients (responders) 
in the indacaterol/glycopyrrolate  group also achieved the minimum clinically important difference  (MCID) of 4 
units when compared to placebo (odds ratio of 2.5, p <0.001), indacaterol (odds  ratio o f 1.3, p =0.041) and 
glycopyrrolate  (odds ratio of 1.5, p=0.003).  Importantly, the the indacaterol/glycopyrrolate treatment arm also 
had a statistically and clinically significant  improvement (defined as ≥1 unit increase) in the TDI total score  
compared with placebo (1.64 unit improvement, p <0.001),  and statistical improvements as compared to   
Figure 1 Intraindividual association between β2 -
adrenergic response on the x-axis (salmeterol)  
and antimuscarinic response on the y -axis

correlation , significant intra -individual variation 
exists in FEV [ADDRESS_578424] 
versus antimuscarinic bronchodilators.

RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 indacaterol (0.78 unit  improvement, p<0.001) and glycopyrrolate (0.73 unit improvement, p<0.001) at Week 12. 
The proportion of patients with a MCID ≥1unit in the TDI total score was significantly higher  with 
indacaterol/glycopyrrolat e compared with placebo, indacaterol  and glycopyrrolate . For TDI, the odds ratio for 
responder rate (with response defined by 1 unit change from baseline) at 12 weeks was 1.58 (95% CI 0.97, 
2.57) and 2.19 (95% CI 1.33, 3.60).  For SGRQ, the odds ratio for responder rate (with response defined by a 
4 unit change from baseline) was 1.71 (95% CI 1.05, 2.78) and 1.80 (95% CI 1.08, 2.98) . There was also a 
significant reduction in mean daily puffs and increase in percentage of days with no rescue medication use w ith 
indacaterol/glycopyrrolate compared with placebo.  An exploratory endpoint in the Flight studies was the change in health -related quality of life assessed by [CONTACT_453564] (CAT) at Week 12.  Using pooled 
data, a mean difference of 1.8 (95% CI 1.1, 2.4) units CAT score improvement was seen in the indacaterol/glycopyrrolate group as compared to placebo (p<0.001).  The difference between 
indacaterol/glycopyrrolate and monocomponents was also statistically significant at the p<0.05 level.  
 
1.4 Rationale for Study Population  
For simplicity we will refer to current and former smokers with FEV
1/FVC≥0.[ADDRESS_578425] 
disease not detected by [CONTACT_453561][INVESTIGATOR_038]. The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453518] (≥ 20 pack years) with a 
range of airflow obstruction and never -smoking controls. In 
preliminary data we categorized GOLD 0 smokers and subjects with GOLD I /II COPD as symptomatic (CAT≥10) or asymptomatic 
(CAT<10). We used CAT because we have previously shown that 
the mMRC≥2 and CAT≥ 10 (both used by [CONTACT_453565] I -IV) are not equivalent and that 
the mMRC ≥2 is overly stringent (10). We also provide 
corroborating evidence where available from another NHLBI 
study, COPDGene. While CAT was not collected in COPDGene , 
we use SGRQ≥25 which is approximately equivalent to CAT≥10 (11). 
 Many  GOLD [ADDRESS_578426] clinically 
important symptoms of COPD. In SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453519] 52% 
of GOLD 0 subjects had CAT≥10 (Figure 1), slightly less than the prevalence of CAT≥10 in GOLD 1&2 (65%, p<0.001) but far 
greater than the prevalence in never -smoking controls (16%, 
p<0.001).  
 Symptomatic GOLD 0 smokers had higher prospective rates of 
exacerbation of respi[INVESTIGATOR_453520] 6 minute walk 
distance (6MWD) . In SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453521], w hether defined based on use 
of antibiotics, systemic corticoster oids, both medications, any 
health care utilization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/emergency department (ED) visits (severe exacerbations), the prospective rate of exacerbations was higher in GOLD 0 smokers with CAT≥10 than in  GOLD 0 with CAT<10 
or healthy never -smoking controls (Figure 2). The 6MWD  was also lower in GOLD 0 with CAT≥10 (408± 100m) 
as compared to both GOLD 0 with CAT<10 (462± 92m) and GOLD 1&2 subjects with CAT<10 (452±101m)  (all 
p<0.05) .  
 
Figure 1.  In SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453521], 52% of GOLD [ADDRESS_578427] elevated symptoms of 
COPD (defined as CAT≥10.  
23 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 In COPDGene, walk distance was similarly reduced 
in symptomatic subjects with normal spi[INVESTIGATOR_453522]. 
asymptomatic subjects (402±104m vs 471±102m, p<0.001).  
 Symptomatic GOLD 0 current/former smokers have 
decreased inspi[INVESTIGATOR_14008], consistent with occult airflow obstruction.  In SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453521], we found that the  post-bronchodilator  inspi[INVESTIGATOR_13999] (IC) was 2.66±0.74 in symptomatic GOLD 
0 subjects vs 2.88±0.75  in asymptomatic GOLD 0 
subjects, p=0.001). The IC in this group was similar to symptomatic GOLD I/II patients ( 2.67±0.81, 
p=0.48) and worse than asymptomatic GOLD I/II patients ( 2.88±0.84, p=0.004). This decreased IC is 
not explained by [CONTACT_453566] 
<-950 Hounsfield units (HU) by [CONTACT_453567] 0 subjects was low 
and no different from asymptomatic subjects 
(p=0.99). Instead, symptomatic GOLD [ADDRESS_578428] a higher Pi10 (a measure of airway wall 
thickness) than asymptomatic GOLD 0 subjects 
(3.73±0.090  vs 3.70±0.090 , p<0.05 ). Hence we hypothesize that these physiologic changes are due to occult 
airway disease. While we could find no studies of bronchodilators in GOLD 0 subjects, several studies in 
GOLD I patients demonstrate the benefit of bronchodilators in terms of improvements in inspi[INVESTIGATOR_14008], functional residual  capacity, residual volume, airways resistance, dynamic hyperinflation and work of breathing 
(12-15). 
 
Many sy mptomatic GOLD 0 current/former smokers are already being treated for COPD, with great variability 
in medication choice. In SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453521], 43% of these subjects were on bronchodilators: 31% SABA and 11% 
SAMA; 31% LAMA and 15% LABA. Finally, 23 % were using inhaled corticosteroids. 
 In the above analyses, all spi[INVESTIGATOR_453523] -bronchodilator and all p -values were Bonferroni- corrected for 
multiple comparisons across four groups (symptomatic /GOLD 0 , asymptomatic  GOLD 0 , symptomatic/GOLD 
I&II, and asymptomatic GOLD I&II ). Current smoking was more common in  symptomatic as compared to 
asymptomatic GOLD 0 subjects (58% vs. 4 2%, p<0.001), and the BMI was higher (29. 8±5.4 vs 27. 8±4.7, 
p<0.001). Therefore all of the above analyses were repeated while controlling for current smoking, BMI as well 
as age, gender, race, ethnicity , congestive heart failure, GERD self -report, and any asthma diagnosis , and 
there was no material change in the results  in these adjusted models .  
 
Summary o f our r
 ationale for the study population : We show that respi[INVESTIGATOR_453524] 0 current/former smokers (i.e. with FEV 1/FVC ≥0.[ADDRESS_578429]-bronchodilator) , and that GOLD [ADDRESS_578430] higher rates of respi[INVESTIGATOR_453525], activity limitations, and evidence of occult airflow 
obstruction (decreased inspi[INVESTIGATOR_14008]). Our data also indicate that this is not due to emphysema but is 
instead associated with airway wall thickening, and we hypothesize that this occult airway disease wi ll respond 
to effective bronchodilator therapy.   
  
1.5 Feasi
bility of the Intervention in the Target Population  
Indacaterol/glycopyrrolate 27.5/15.6  mcg inhaled twice daily  is simp le to use and should be feasible in terms of 
ease of use and tolerability in the target population for this study (symptomatic smokers with FEV 1/FVC≥ 0.70) 
as it is in the population for which it was developed (symptomatic smokers with FEV 1/FVC<0.70).  Whil e an 
RCT of long- acting bronchodilator therapy in symptomatic GOLD 0 smokers (i.e. those with FEV 1/FVC≥ 0.70)

with increased prospective rates of exacerbations in GOLD 
0 subjects.  
24 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 has never been performed, several studies in GOLD I patients demonstrate the benefit of bronchodilators in 
terms of improvements in inspi[INVESTIGATOR_14008], functional residual capacity, residual volume, airways 
resistance, dynamic hyperinflation and work of breathing ( 12-15).  As outlined above in 1.2., there is also 
evidenc e that the degree of FEV 1 improvement and symptom improvement defined by [CONTACT_453568] 4 point drop in SGRQ with indacaterol/glycopyrrolate  therapy actually increases in parallel with FEV 1.  In 
summary these data provide rationale for long- acting bronchodilator therapy in the target population for this 
proposal.  
2.  Study Hypotheses/Objectives  
2.[ADDRESS_578431] the hypothesis that symptomatic current and former smokers with spi[INVESTIGATOR_453526] (post- bronchodilator FEV 1/FVC≥ 0.[ADDRESS_578432] -BD FVC ≥  70% predicted [to 
guard against restrictive lung disease] ) will still derive symptomatic benefit from lon g-acting bronchodilator 
therapy even though they are excluded from  current GOLD guideline recommendations.

RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/[ADDRESS_578435]. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] ( SGRQ ) is a validated health status instrument developed 
for COPD that contains 50 items divided into three components: "Symptoms" concerned with respi[INVESTIGATOR_037], their frequency and severity; "Activity" concerned with activities that cause or are limited by  
[CONTACT_94277]; and "Impacts" which covers a range of aspects concerned with social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airway disease ( 16). A score will be calculated for each component 
and a "Total" score will also be calculated. In each case the lowest possible value is zero and the highest 100. 
Higher values correspond to greater impairment of quality of life.  The accepted minimal clinically important 
difference ( MCID ) for SGRQ is a 4 unit change  (17). At the [ADDRESS_578436] is a validated, short and simple patient completed questionnaire which has 
been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of patients with COPD  (11, 18). 
The CAT is an 8- item questionnaire suitable for completion by [CONTACT_453569]. When 
completing the questionnaire, subjects rate their experience on a scale, ranging from 0 ( minimum impairment) 
to 5 (maximum impairment) with a scoring range of [ADDRESS_578437].   The 
accepted MCID for CAT is a 2 unit change ( 19). 
BDI/TDI  Dyspnea will be measured at baseline using the baseline dyspnea index (BDI) and during the 
treatment period using the transition dyspnea index (TDI), which captures changes from  baseline.  The BDI 
and TDI were originally developed to assess dyspnea in patients with a variety of respi[INVESTIGATOR_453531].  Each have three domains; functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. The BDI domains are rated from 0 (severe) to 4 (unimpaired) and the rates are summed for the baseline focal score ranging from 0 to 12; the lower the score the worse the severity of dyspnea. The TDI domains are rated 
from -3 (major deterioration) to 3 (major improvement) and the rates are summed for the transition focal score 
ranging from - 9 to 9; minus scores indicate deterioration.  The accepted MCID for TDI is 1 unit change ( 20).   
3.5 Stratification, Randomization, and Blinding/Masking  
A permuted block randomization scheme will be created with varying block sizes stratified by [CONTACT_138554] , 
smoking history (current smoker/former smoker)  and prior maintenance treatment for COPD requiring washout . 
Once a subject has completed the screening and evaluation for inclusion/exclusion criteria, the randomization 
process will begin. Subjects will be randomized to receive active drug and placebo with equal probability (1:1), 
via Internet  with a central interactive response system (IVRS). On the day of randomization, after the subject 
has successfully met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, the investigator or designee will log in to the central 
randomization website  to obtain the assigned kit randomization number for that subject. One pharmacist at 
each site will be unblinded to treatment group. For resupply of the site, the pharmacy  will need to notify the 
NEMO to request the next shipment of drug supply when on- site drug supply is down to one placebo kit or one 
active drug kit . The trial results will be reported according to guidelines specified in the CONSORT statement. 
A flow diagram describing screening, recruitment, randomization, dropout, and vital status will be included in 
the primary manuscript. AEs and efficacy data will be presented by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_578438] 1 dose of study drug. 
3.5.1  Procedure for Unblinding/Unmasking  
Unblindin g must be approved by [CONTACT_453570] .  In the case of emergent  unblinding, the site investigator will notify the 
protocol chairs  and the DCC  of the unblinding event on the next business day; the protocol chairs and the DCC 
27 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 will then notify the  DSMB and FDA. A full account of the event will be recorded, including the date and time of 
the unblinding, the reason for the decision to unblind, and the name  [CONTACT_453601] (i.e. coordinator, PI, subject, etc). The reasons for unblinding 
of a participant’s treatment will be included in the final study report.  
3.5.[ADDRESS_578439] (or qualified 
designee) who prepares the study drug and the pharmacy monitor who monitors the pharmacy records and 
procedures, will be blinded to study treatment throughout the study.  A designated statistician will securely maintain an unblinded randomization schema.

The class of medications listed in Table 4.3 -1 are not permitted to be taken during the study and are 
considered exclusion criteria.  Medications in Table 4.3 -2 are also not permitted but subjects may be washed 
out per protocol, see Section 7. If a patient requires any of these medications and they cannot be safely  
washed out (with permission of the subject’s primary physician) then they  should not be included in the  study.  
Short acting beta agonists are the only “rescue” medication allowed during the trial.   Each  concomitant drug 
must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria and the tables  below to see if it allowed. If in doubt 
you should contact [CONTACT_453573] a patient or allowing a new medication to be started.

NOTE:  If participant is on a non- potassium sparing diuretic (unless administered as a fixed -dose combination, i.e. all in 
one pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]/tablet with a potassium conserving drug or has adequate documentation of concomitant use of a potassium 
conserving drug) , we require them to have a serum potassium level check either at the enrollment visit or at a separate 
screening visit and to excl ude them if they have a potassium level that is below the lower limit of normal for that 
laboratory. The serum potassium level must be available and reviewed before randomization.  If it is desired that a 
patient initiate a non- potassium sparing diuretic (not as part of fixed -dose combination) after the subject has been 
randomized, a potassium level that is above the lower limit of normal for the chosen laboratory should be documented 
if on study drug.

4.4 Recruitment and Retention  
A variety of recruitment techniques at each center should be employed as allowed by [CONTACT_15686]’s including 
local advertising aimed at (a) health system patients ; (b) smoking cessation groups ; (c) general public , 
including social media; (d) review of local databases or patient registries; (e) pulmonary function test database 
and electronic medical record query; (f) screening of pulmonary clinics, (g) lung cancer screening clinics and 
(h) primary c are clinics.   The study will also be posted on clinicaltrials.gov.  Due to the short duration of the 
study and low number of study visits, we expect attrition to be low.  However, we will also work with the clinical 
centers to keep logistical burden on subjects to a minimum.

Adverse drug reactions  
 
30 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 Data provided from the prescribing information (package insert) approved by [CONTACT_453574]/glycopyrrolate is outlined in Table 5.1 -1. 
 
 
Table 5.1 -1 Adverse Events with Indacaterol/glycopyrrolate greater than or equal to 1% incidence and 
higher than placebo in COPD patients  
 Indacaterol/glycopyrrolate  
27.5/15.6 mcg BID  Indacaterol  
27.5 mcg BID  Glycopyrrolate  
15.6 mcg BID  Placebo  
Nasopharyngitis  21 (4.1%)  13 (2.5%)  12 (2.3%)  9 (1.8%)  
Hypertension  10 (2.0%)  5 (1.0%)  3 (0.6%)  7 (1.4%)  
Back pain  9 (1.8%)  7 (1.4%)  2 (0.4%)  3 (0.6%)  
Oropharyngeal pain  8 (1.6%)  4 (0.8%)  8 (1.6%)  6 (1.2%)  
 
Other adverse reactions occurring more f requently with indacaterol/glycopyrrolate than with placebo, but 
with an incidence of less than 1% include dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, chest pain, fatigue, peripheral edema, 
rash/pruritus, insomnia, dizziness, bladder obstruction/urinary retention, atrial fibrillation, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], tachycardia.   Additional adverse reactions that were reported in registration trials included upper and lower 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], pneumonia, diarrhea, headache, gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
hyperglycemia, rhinitis.    
In addition, indacaterol/glycopyrrolate can produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life- threatening. 
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after administration of indacaterol or 
glycopyrrolate .  Indacaterol, like other beta2 -agoni sts, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular 
effect in some patients as measured by [CONTACT_453575], systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or symptoms.  In addition, beta- agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of 
the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance 
of these findings is unknown.   Indacaterol/glycopyrrolate also has the potential to worsen pre- existing 
chronic conditions including urinary retention and narrow -angle glaucoma.   
Contraindications  
All long acting beta agonists are contraindicated in patients with asthma without the use of long- term 
asthma controller medications.  Per protocol, patients with a primary diagnosis of asthma will be  excluded 
from participation in this study.  
5.[ADDRESS_578445] 3% of patients taking albuterol report headache, tachycardia (increased heart rate), muscle 
pain, dizziness, pharyngitis (sore throat), and rhinitis (runny nose). Less than 3% of patients taking albuterol report chest pain, infection, diarrhea, glossitis (swelling of the tongue), anxiety, dyspnea (difficulty breathing), ear disorder, ear pain, and urinary tract infection.  In small cumulative dose studies, tremor, nervousness, and 
headache were most frequently reported. 
5.3 Risks of Study Procedures 
Demographic  and
  health status information:  Subjects could experience fatigue or frustration during the 
completion of health status instruments.  
31 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20  
Physiologic studies :   Mild respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] , transient desaturation, and lightheadedness  can be seen during 
the pulmonary  function testing. These are rarely significant if testing is performed by [CONTACT_453576]. Participants will be monitored closely during the procedure. 
 
Washout :   For subjects requiring washout of an inhaled respi[INVESTIGATOR_335636], participants could experience 
increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506].  If significant symptoms are experienced during the washout period, the 
subjects will not be enrolled in the study.  
 
Research Lab / Venipuncture: The risk associated with blood draws can include but is not limited to pain, 
bruising, or superficial phlebitis.  The vein in which the needle has been inserted to draw blood may become 
sore and red. A temporary “black and blue mark” may develop, and rarely fainting may occur.  
5.4 P otential  Benefits  
Participating subjects may benefit from the intervention in terms of a reduction in respi[INVESTIGATOR_453534], wheezing and cough.  This study may also benefit society in demonstrating treatment efficacy of long acting bronchodilator therapy in patients currently not included in COPD treatment 
guidelines.   
6.   Investigational Agent/Device/Intervention
 
6.1 Investigational Agent/Device  
The investigational agent is indacaterol/glycopyrrolate 27.5/15.6  mcg inhaled twice daily.  This d rug has been 
extensively studied in COPD and is FDA approv ed for treatment of COPD in the US .  Administration of this 
medication involves removing capsule from a blister pack, placing the capsule in the Neohaler device, 
puncturing the capsule with the device and inhaling via the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], see Figure 6.1- 1. 
 Figure 6.1 -1.  Neohaler.  
 
 
6.2 Drug Accountability  
Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) the investigator will maintain adequate 
records of the disposition of the investigational agent, including the date and quantity of the drug received, to 
whom the drug was dispensed (participant -by-participant accounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug 
accidentally or deliberately destroyed.

RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/[ADDRESS_578446] wi ll be available for inspection. 
Indacaterol/glycopyrrolate will be dispensed to the sites by [CONTACT_453577].    
6.3 Assessment of Adherence to the Investigational Agent  
Compliance will be assessed through indacaterol/glycopyrrolate capsule counts  at the final study visit . 
7.   Study Procedures  
7.1 Pre-screening Phone Call  All Subjects  
Subjects will be evaluated by [CONTACT_094] -screening phone call prior to the screening and enrollment v isit (Visit 1). 
During the pre -screening phone call, study staff will review the inclusion and exclusion criteria with the subject 
to determine their eligibility.  This will include administration of the CAT questionnaire by [CONTACT_453578] ≥ 10.  If subject is eligible a  screen/enr ollment visit will be 
scheduled.   If subject is ineligible due to factors that may be subject to change over time (e.g. BMI drops or a 
prohibited medication has been discontinued for clinical reasons), subjects may be undergo phone call re-screening.  Even subjects who are brought in for a Visit 1 may be re- screened (see 7.2).  
 If the subject is currently taking a prohibited COPD medication from Table 4.[ADDRESS_578447] may  be brought in 
for an additional on -site screening visit (visit 0) to be consented and the COPD medication discontinued, after 
seeking agreement from the subject’s primary provider .  Subjects  will be strictly instructed that if they cannot 
tolerate being off of their COPD medication, then they should restart their COPD medication and notify us.  The 
subject will be  called 3 weeks  after the COPD medication discontinued to see if they are tolerating washout 
and if so, be brought back for Visit 1 , 30 days after the initial on-site screening visit.   
7.2 Screening/ Enrollment   (non washout subject s, Visit 1)  
A subject number will be assigned at this time of signed informed consent. The required order of completion of 
these assessments will be further outlined in the Manual of Procedures.

33 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 of a potassium conserving drug ), we require them to have a serum potassium level check either at the 
enrollment visit or at a separate screening visit and to exclude them if they have a potassium level that is below 
the lower limit of normal for that laboratory. The serum potassium level must be available and reviewed before 
randomization.   If the level is checked and is above the lower limit of normal for the chosen laboratory, the 
subject may be enrolled into the study.  If it is desired that a patient initiate a non- potassium sparing diuretic 
(not as part of fixed -dose combination) after the subject has been randomized, a potassium level that is above 
the lower limit of normal for the chosen laboratory should be documented if on study drug . 
 Subjects who meet enrollment criteria will be r andomized to indacaterol/glycopyrrolate versus placebo at this 
visit.  If at this visit the subject is determined to be taking a prohibited COPD medication from Table 4.[ADDRESS_578448] would be brought back for a 
Visit 1  (follow Schedule of Events for Washout Subjects) .  At this  visit, every patient will be encouraged to 
increase physical activity during the study period.  Subjects who do not meet enr ollment criteria at Visit [ADDRESS_578449] to change over time (e.g. BMI drops or

7.13 Special  Consideration(s) for Treatment Failure Subjects  
Treatment failure is defined as an increase in lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_453540], corticosteroids or antibiotics.  
If any new inhaled respi[INVESTIGATOR_335636] (other than Albuterol), antibiotic, or oral steroid was started for lower 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (NOT sinusitis), patient has met treatment failure endpoint. The subject should be encouraged to remain in the study and on study drug, unless started on an open label long- acting 
bronchodilator.  For treatment failure subjects where study medication is discontinued, the full End of Study 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] 0 -3 AUC should NOT be performed.   Rather only one pre- BD FEV
1, FVC, SVC and IC should be 
performed.  
ALL subjects who experience treatment failure should continue with the study through to completion. Subjec ts 
who require treatment with a  prohibited COPD medication (Table 4.3- 2) shall discontinue study drug and NOT 
re-start study drug .   
Subjects who meet treatment failure AND who discontinue drug will perform a modified pulmonary function 
assessment at  the end of study visit (Week 12).  Refer to the study Manual of Operations for further details.   
7.13.1 Special  Consideration (s) for subje cts who start a prohibited medication (Table 4.3 -1) 
Subjects who begin treatment with a prohibited medication (Table 4.3- 1) shall discontinue study drug and NOT 
re-start study drug .  These subjects will perform a modified pulmonary function assessment at the end of study 
visit (Week 12).  Refer to the study Manual of Operations for further details.  
7.13.2 Special  Consideration(s) for subjects who experience an AE/SAE requiring study drug 
interruption  
Subjects that have stopped taking study drug due to an adverse event may re -start taking study drug after 
recovery. In all instances the timing of re -starting study d rug is left to the discretion of the site Primary 
Investigator.  
  
Note that adverse events requiring treatment with a COPD -prohibited medication (4.3.2) meet the definition for 
treatment failure.  These individuals shall not re start study drug.  
 
Additionally, these subjects will perform a modified pulmonary function assessment at the end of study visit 
(Week 12).  Refer to the study Manual of Operations for further details.

whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research (modified from the definition of 
adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on Harmonization E -6 Guidelines for Good Clinical 
Practice) (f rom OHRP "Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to 
Subjects or Others and Adverse Events (1/15/07)"  http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2  )  
For this study, an adverse event will include any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with:   
• Study therapy regimen: Occurring within one week of use of indacaterol/glycopyrrolate . 
• Study mandated procedures: Any  event occurring within one day  of a mandated study procedure will be 
considered a possible adverse event of these procedures and will be evaluated further for any relationship. 
These procedures include spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  
For the procedures below, clinical situations are listed that are considered to be outside the normal range of 
outcomes and will be recorded as Adverse Events.  These situations do not limit an investigator from recording and reporting any other events, associated or  not with these procedures as AEs.  
Pulmonary Function Testing  
• Wheezing, shortness of breath  or chest tightness requiring treatment with bronchodilators within 30 
minutes from the procedure  
• Coughing requiring treatment with bronchodilators within 30 minutes from the procedure  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational drug caused the adverse 
event. For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser 
degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)).  
8.2.2 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the package 
insert or is not listed at the specificity, severity or rate of occurrence that has been observed; or is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the prot ocol.  
8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator  it 
results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)): 
1. Results in death;  
2. Is life-threatening  i.e. places a participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred;  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
4. Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity ;  
5. Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; OR  
6. Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
participant’s  health and may require  medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition ( e.g. allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the 
emergency room or at home).

RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 8.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events  
8.3.1 Grading Criteria  
The study site will grade the severity of adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_453580]’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0) This document (referred to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) provides a 
common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the 
clinical significance of all adverse events. The NCI -CTCAE has been reviewed by [CONTACT_453581].  
Grade 1 = mild adverse event.  
Grade 2 = moderate adver se event.  
Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event.  
Grade 4 = life -threatening or disabling adverse event. 
Grade 5 = death.  
 
Events of grade 2 or higher will be recorded on the appropriate electronic AE case report form for this study. If a specific event or result from a given clinical evaluation is not included in the NCI -CTCAE 
manual, then an abnormal result would be considered an adverse event if changes in therapy or 
monitoring are implemented as a result of the event/result. 
8.3.2 Attribution Definitions  
The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study therapy regimen or study procedure(s) 
will initially b e determined by [CONTACT_453582] .  The 
relationship of an adverse event to study therapy regimen or procedures will be determined using the 
descriptors and definitions provided in Table 8 .3.2.  
For additional information and a printable version of the NCI -CTCAE manual, consult the NCI -CTCAE 
web site: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html .

[ADDRESS_578460] a probable causal 
relationship.  
3 Possibly  The adverse event has a reasonable possibility to 
be related; there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.  
UNRELATED CATEGORY  
4 Not related  The adverse event is clearly not related.  
8.4 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events 
8.4.1 Collection Period  
41 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/[ADDRESS_578461] completes study participation or until 
30 days after he/she prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent) or is withdrawn from the study.  
8.4.2 Collecting Adverse Events  
Adverse events (including SAEs) may be discovered through any of these methods:  
• Observing the subject.  
• Interviewing the subject [e.g., using a checklist, structured questioning, diary, etc.]   . 
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject.  
• In addition, an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an 
adverse event, as defined in Section [ADDRESS_578462] adverse events and serious adverse events as described previously (Section 8 .2, Definitions) on the appropriate eCRF regardless of the relationship to study t herapy 
regimen or study procedure.  
Once recorded, an AE/SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae, or until the end of study 
participation, or until [ADDRESS_578463] prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent)/or is withdrawn from the study, whichever occurs first.  
8.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events  
8.5.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Each adverse event is to be classified by [CONTACT_211284] (see Section 8.2.3, Serious Adverse 
Event) or non- serious.  This classification determines the reporting procedures to be followed.  If a serious 
adverse event occurs, expedited reporting to local regulatory bodies will follow local regulations as appropriate. The site investigator will report to protocol chairs and the DCC all serious adverse events (see Section 8.2.3, 
Serious Adverse Event), regardless of relationship to study drug or expectedness within [ADDRESS_578464]’s participation in the clinical trial, i.e., prior to undergoing any trial -related procedure and/or receiving 
investigational product,  until a subject completes study participation or until he/she prematurely withdraws or is 
withdrawn from the study.    
 
For serious adverse events, all requested information on the AE/SAE eCRF should be provided. In particular, if 
the serious adverse event is fatal or life- threatening, notification to the DCC must occur immediately.  This 
timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously forwarded serious adverse event 
reports . In the event that  the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious adverse event 
immediately (e.g., if an outpatient trial subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse 
event.   As additional details become available, the AE/SAE eCRF will be updated and submitted. When an 
SAE report is sent it will include the PIs assessment of the adverse event and assignment of a relationship to any specific aspect of the study.   In addition, an investigator may be requested to obtain specific additional 
follow- up information in an expedited fashion.  This information may be more detailed than that captured on the 
adverse event case report form.  In general, this will include a description of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible 
causality.  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses 
must be provided.  In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted 
as soon as possible to the DCC or its designated representative. The investigator’s assessment of causality 
must be provided.  An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether ther e exists a 
reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an adverse event.  If the 
42 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 investigator's causality assess ment is "unknown but not related to study drug", this should be clearly 
documented on study records.  In addition, if the investigator determines the adverse event is associated with 
trial procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and eCRF, as 
appropriate .  
8.5.2 Reporting to Health Authority  
After an adverse event requiring 24 hour reporting (per Section 8.5.1, Reporting of Serious Adverse Events ), 
the event will be submitted by [CONTACT_453583] .  Although this protocol was submitted to the FDA and received an IND exemption, MedWatch 
forms will be completed for applicable Serious Adverse Events and forwarded to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals  
(global oversight for the study)  for further reporting to the FDA.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Annual Reporting 
The investigator will include in the annual study report to local regulatory  authorities all adverse events 
classified as:  
• Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction (see Section [IP_ADDRESS], Suspected Adverse 
Reaction, and Section 8.2.2, Unexpected Adverse Event). 
• Serious adverse reaction  that is  not suspected to be related t o the treatment (see Section 8 .2.2, 
Suspected Adverse Reaction).  
Pregnancies are not reported as serious adverse events.  
The DCC  will receive a copy of the annual study report submitted by [CONTACT_453584]. The investigator shall also summarize safety data at the end of the study and periodically 
throughout the study for the DSMB. These reports may include (but are not limited to) masked summaries and 
listings of AEs, SAEs, events requiring discontinuation of a study -mandated procedure for individual subjects 
and protocol deviations.  All adverse events (not just those requiring 24 -hour reporting) will be reported by [CONTACT_453585] . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Expedited Safety Reporting  
Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction  [S[LOCATION_003]R]  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS], Suspected Adverse 
Reaction and Section 8 .2, Unexpected Adverse Event  and 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)i).  
The investigator shall  report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  The 
investigator shall  report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest 
a causal rel ationship between the study drug and the adverse event, such as:  
1. A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, or Stevens -Johnson Syndrome);  
2. One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is 
otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture);  
3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the 
study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occ ur more frequently in the 
drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
 
SAEs that are unexpected will be reported to the DSMB by [CONTACT_453586] 15 calendar 
days of their notification of the event.  If a death or life- threatening event occurs that is believed by [CONTACT_453587], notification to the DSMB  by [CONTACT_453588] 
43 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 within 7 calendar days after their initial notification of the event.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_453542].  
8.5.3 Reporting of Adverse Events to IRBs/IECs 
The investigator shall report adverse events, including expedited reports, in a timely fashion to their re spective 
IRBs/IECs in accordance  with applicable local regulations and guidelines. 
8.6 Reporting of Other Safety Information  
An investigator shall promptly notify the site IRB as well as the DCC when an “unanticipated problem involving 
risks to participants or others” is identified, which is not otherwise reportable as an adverse event.  
8.7 Review of Safety Information  
8.7.1 DCC Adverse Event  Review  
The DCC  shall receive annual reports from the protocol investigator compi[INVESTIGATOR_453543], SAEs, and pregnancies recorded by [CONTACT_453589] e CRFs.   The Protocol 
Chairs will also review SAE and pregnancy reports in real t ime. 
8.7.2 DSMB Review  
[IP_ADDRESS] Planned DSMB Reviews  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) shall review safety data at least yearly during planned DSMB 
Data  Review Meetings. Data for the planned safety reviews will include, at a minimum, a listing of all reported 
AEs and SAEs.  The DSMB will be informed of any Expedited Safety Report s in a timely manner.   Reports will 
be prepared by [CONTACT_453590] . Tables showing 
study progress will be presented by [CONTACT_453591]. These will minimally include recruitment, 
protocol deviations, adherence, attrition, adverse events, data quality, descriptive characteristics of the study 
sample, and efficacy.  All AEs will be reported as described abov e.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Ad hoc DSMB Reviews  
In addition to the pre -scheduled data reviews and planned safety monitoring that will be coordinated by [CONTACT_219001], the DSMB may be called upon for ad hoc  reviews. The DSMB will review any event that potentially 
impact s safety at the request of the Protocol C hairs or the DCC.  In addition, the following events will trigger an 
ad hoc  comprehensive DSMB Safety Review:  
• Any death that occurs in the study, which is possibly or definitely related to study treatment regimen.  
• The occurrence of a Grade [ADDRESS_578465] and/or continuation.

RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/[ADDRESS_578467] -BD FEV 1/FVC≥ 0.70, a group of patients that has not 
previously been objectively evaluated in a placebo- controlled trial.  The study design is a two -visit study of 580, 
symptomatic current or former smokers  who will be randomized in a double- blind, placebo- controlled fashion to 
indacaterol/glycopyrrolate ver sus placebo.  “Symptomatic” for the purposes of this study will be defined as CAT 
score≥10.  During the first visit, baseline SGRQ score will be established and the subject assigned to drug 
versus  placebo.  SGRQ score will be reassessed at the second in- person visit . Treatment failure during the 
study period will be defined by [CONTACT_453592][INVESTIGATOR_453508], 
long- acting inhaled bronchodilator, inhaled or oral corticosteroids, or antibiotics . 
9.2 Endpoints/Outcomes 
The primary scientific endpoint of this study is the proportion of subjects who experience a four point drop in 
SGRQ in the treatment versus placebo groups  and do not meet criteria for treatment failure during the 12 week 
treatment period.  The rationale for this composite definition of “success” with respect to the primary outcome is 
that differential treatment failure in the two arms could bias the observed change in SGRQ at [ADDRESS_578468] treatment failure during the study as eligible for “success” at the end of the study. Instead, they will be considered a “failure” with respect to the primary outcome regardless 
of their SGRQ score at 12 weeks. This will also allow us to avoid a major source of non -ignorable missing data 
due to “drop outs” and lack of data on SGRQ score at 12 weeks. If those drop outs occurred because of 
treatment failure, then they will still add to our primary outcome because they will meet criteria for “failure”.   
Key Secondary endpoints include: 
a. Proportion of subjects in the treatment versus placebo groups who experience a two point improvement  
in CAT score  without treatment failure. 
b. Proportion of subjects in the treatment versus placebo groups who experience a one unit improvement 
in BDI/TDI s core without treatment failure. 
c. Mean change in SGRQ  
d. Mean change in CAT  
e. Mean change in BDI/TDI  
f. AUC
0-3h for FEV 1 
g. Mean 12 -week change in trough FEV 1 between treatment and placebo groups  (absolute and % 
predicted) . 
h. Mean 12 -week change in trough Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10226] , FEF25- 75% and iso- volume FEF25 -75%between 
treatment and placebo groups  (absolute and % predicted) . 
i. Mean change in symptoms and rescue medication use based on daily diary.  
j. Treatment failure defined by [CONTACT_453593][INVESTIGATOR_453508], long-
acting inhaled bronchodilator and/or corticosteroid  (inhaled or oral).  
 
9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias  
A stratified, randomized block procedure will be used where strata are defined by [CONTACT_138554] , smoking 
status  and history of prior treatment with COPD maintenance medication. 
9.4 Analysis Plan  
9.4.1 Analysis Populations. 
45 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 [IP_ADDRESS] Safety Population 
The Safety Population is defined as all subjects who have consented to participate.  The Safety Population will 
be used for all safety analyses.  Subjects will be analyzed by [CONTACT_82153].  If subjects inadvertently receive both active drug and placebo, they will be included in the indacaterol/glycopyrrolate group.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Populations  
The primary outcome will be based on intention- to-treat population for the SGRQ measurement which will be 
supplemented by [CONTACT_453594] a composite endpoint. For individuals who do not 
complete [ADDRESS_578469] the analysis.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Effect of drop outs on the Efficacy population  
Our composite primary endpoint definition will allow us to avoid a major source of missing data due to “drop 
outs” and lack of data on SGRQ score at 12 weeks. If those drop outs occurred because of treatment failure 
(which may be disease- related and intervention- related) , then they will still be “informative” in that they add to 
our primary outcome because they will meet criteria for “ treatment failure”.  There will remain some drop outs 
that are “ non-informative” because they are due to factors other than treatment failure. This number should be 
small given our relatively short study and should be due to random causes  that are unrelated to the disease or 
the intervention.  Subjects with non -informative missing measures at 12 weeks will not be included in the 
analysis .  
9.4.2 Primary Analysis of Primary Endpoint (s)/Outcome (s)   
The primary analysis will be conducted via G
 EE regression with logit link to compare the proportion of subjects 
who experience improvement with treatment defined as a four  point drop in SGRQ and absence of tr eatment 
failure in the treatment versus placebo groups, adjusted for clinical center of recruitment, change of smoking 
status  between baseline and [ADDRESS_578470]. Change of Smoking status will be modeled as  a 
categorical variable with four categories reflecting the four potential types of changes patients might 
experience ( persistent smoker, persistent form er smoker, smoker  quit smoking during the trial , former smoker  
restarts smoking during the trial). Baseline BMI will be  included as a  continuous variable.  
 
D
enote ∆ SGRQ ij be the change of SGRG between baseline and [ADDRESS_578471] j ( j=1,2,3,..n i) from site I 
(i=1, 2,3… , m).   
 If ∆ SGRQ
ij ≥4 and no trt failure, let Yij=1, otherwise Y ij=0. The model we will use is as the following:  
 logit{Pr(Y
ij=1)}= β1+β2Treatment ij+β3Change of Smoking Status ij+β4Washout ij+β5BMI ij 
Within site association among the response will be modeled by [CONTACT_453595].  
 
9.4.3 Supportive Analyses of the Primary Endpoint (s)/Outcome(s)   
To address the potential heterogeneity our study population, additional planned supportive analyses will be to 
examine the primary endpoint in specific subgroups based on smoking status (current smoker yes/no), long-
term respi[INVESTIGATOR_453544] s tudy requiring washout and baseline bronchodilator 
46 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 responsiveness and BMI (males with BMI >30kg/m2, males with BMI ≤30kg/m2, females with BMI  >30kg/m2, 
females with BMI ≤30kg/m2).  Additional exploratory subgroup analyses will also include gender (male/fem ale), 
age (<65 years/≥65 years), baseline FEV 1% predicted baseline IC  (< median for all randomized subjects / ≥ 
median for all randomized subjects), presence of chronic bronchitis , Interaction s between these covariates and 
treatment  will be tested to study whether treatment effect on primary outcome differs between corresponding 
subgroups. If interaction term is found to be significant, additional analysis will be done to study treatment 
effect within each subgroups.   Each covariate will be tested one at a time.  
9.4.4 Analyses of Secondary and Other Endpoint (s)/Outcome(s)  
As outlined for analysis of the primary endpoint,  a similar GEE  regression will be conducted to compare the 
proportion of subjects who experience a 2 point drop in CAT  without treatment failure, a 1 point drop in TDI 
without treatment failure and treatment failure alone in the treatment versus placebo groups  adjusted for 
clinical center and smoking status . For analysis  of continuous measures including 12- week change in trough 
FEV 1, trough Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10226] , FEF25 -75% and iso- volume FEF25- 75% and AUC 0-3h, analysis will be 
conducted with linear mixed models  to adjust for center effect . No adjustment for multiplicity will be made.    
9.4.[ADDRESS_578472] including age, gender, smoking status, 12- hour trough FEV 1%, 12-hour trough IC, 
bronchodilator responsiveness , BMI and history of long- term respi[INVESTIGATOR_453545].

12 weeks of follow -up, whichever is sooner.   
Safety Assessments  
The following assessments will be used to monitor safety:  
• Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs ) 
• Changes in FEV
[ADDRESS_578474] listings will be prepared for all safety 
data.  
Adverse Events  
47 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 Frequencies (number and percentage) of subjects with one or more treatment emergent AEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570], by [CONTACT_453596] (MedDRA™) terminology.  All treatment emergent AEs, all treatment emergent AEs 
potentially related to study drug, all treatment emergent SAEs and all treatment emergent SAEs potentially related to study drug will be summarized.  Specific AEs of special interest, particularly respi[INVESTIGATOR_453546], will be outlined in the SAP and summarized.   
The incidence of AEs, and their severity, as well as the incidence of subjects who withdraw due to an A E will 
be tabulated.  A subject listing of all treatment emergent AEs, and AEs causing study discontinuation will be 
presented.  
Changes in FEV
1 
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) in changes  in FEV 1 will be tabulated 
for the overall randomized population and by [CONTACT_1570] (labeled as ‘A’ and ‘B’).  
9.6 Statistical Hypotheses  
The superiority of indacaterol/glycopyrrolate over placebo will be evaluated by [CONTACT_453597] (Ho) versus the alternative hypothesis (Ha):  
 
Ho: There is no difference in the proportion of individuals with a [ADDRESS_578475] -BD FEV 1/FVC ≥0.70 treated with 
indacaterol/glycopyrrolate compared to placebo. 
 
Ha: There is a difference in in the proportion of individuals with a [ADDRESS_578476] -BD FEV 1/FVC ≥0.70 treated with 
indacaterol/glycopyrrolate compared to placebo. 
9.[ADDRESS_578477] on SGRQ w as slightly smaller than Flight  2, 57% of 
subjects taking indacaterol/glycopyrrolate vs 39% of  subjects taking placebo had a ≥4 unit decrease in SGRQ .  
Using these data we estimate (with a two- samp le test of proportions) that 290 subjects per arm would provide 
90% power with the following assumptions:  (1) a type I error rate of .05; (2) 10% loss t o follow- up and (3) 
approximately 20% lower effect size given the Flight studies were based on a more severe patient population.  
Our primary analysis will define “response” as both a ≥[ADDRESS_578478] that our 
composite outcome (including the treatment failure definition) will have .  However  we believe that a sample 
size estimate using this approach should provide a realistic estimate of power  given that we are assuming a 
lower effect size and protecting against bias towards the null result .

RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/[ADDRESS_578479] confidentiality of 
medical and research information that may be linked to identified individuals.  
11. Protocol Deviations  
11.1 Protocol Deviation  Definitions  
 
Protocol Deviation  – The investigators and site staff will conduct the study in accordance to the protocol ; no 
deviations from the protocol are permitted .  Any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures constitutes a protocol deviation.  As a result of any deviation, corrective actions will be developed 
by [CONTACT_3483].  
 
Major Protocol Deviation (Protocol Violation) - A Protocol Violation is a deviation from the IRB approved 
protocol that may affect the subject's rights, safety, or well -being and/or the completeness, accuracy and 
reliability of the s tudy data.   In addition, protocol violations include willful or knowing breaches of human 
subject protection regulations, or policies, any action that is inconsistent with the NIH Human Research 
Protection Program’s research, medical, and ethical principles, and a serious or continuing noncompliance with 
federal, state, local or institutional human subject protection regulations, policies, or procedures.   
 
Non-Major  Protocol Deviation - A non-major protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from 
the study design or procedures of a research protocol that does not  have a major impact on the subject's 
rights, safety or well -being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data.  
11.[ADDRESS_578480] review. Upon determination that a protocol deviation has occurred, 
the study staff will a) notify the site Principal investigator, b) notify the DCC and the Protocol Chairs, c)  will 
complete a Protocol Deviation eCRF, d) and report the deviation to the local regulatory authorities.  The 
Protocol Chairs and the DCC will make the decision as to whether the d eviation is major or not and what the 
impact of the d eviation on the study participant or the entire study may be.  Protocol Deviations will also be 
reported by [CONTACT_453598] . 
11.3 Ethical Considerations and Compliance with Good Clinical Practice  
11.4 Statement of Compliance 
This clinical study will be conducted using good clinical practice (GCP), as delineated in Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance, and according to the criteria specified in this study protocol.  
Before study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201].  Any amendments to the protocol or to the consent materials will also be approved by [CONTACT_12228].  
49 
 
RETHINC Version 4 .2 06/25/20 20 11.5 Informed Consent Process 
The consent process will provide information about the study to a prospective participant and will allow 
adequate time for review and discussion prior to his/her decision.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_453547], will review the consent and answer questions.  The participant will have the 
option to speak to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_453548]. The prospective participant will be told that being in the trial is voluntary and that he or she may withdraw from the study at any 
time, for any reason.  All participants (or their legally acceptable representative) will read, sign, and date a 
consent form before undergoing any study procedures.  Consent materials will be presented in English and a 
copy of the signed consent form will be given to the participant.   The consent form will be revised when 
important new safety information is available, the protocol is amended, and/or new information becomes 
available that may affect participation in the study.  
11.6 Privacy and Confidentiality  
A participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each participant will be 
assigned a unique identification number and these numbers rather than names will be used to collect, store, 
and report participant information.  Site personnel will not transmit documents containing personal health 
identifiers (PHI) to the study sponsor or their representatives.

 1.0 Background, Rationale and Context  
 
In preparation for a full-scale randomized clinical trial ( RCT) of an internet -
delivered positive affect (PA)  intervention for young adult cancer survivors, the 
EMPOWER study  will collect pi[INVESTIGATOR_3674] a 
theoretically -driven, empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -grounded, individual intervention to promote 
positive affect  (PA).1 An innovative, intervention for HIV patients (Lessons in 
Linking Affect and Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: LILAC) will be adapted for  use with young adult cancer 
survivors. This intervention teaches eight cognitive and behavioral skills to 
enhance PA, which may broaden and enhance an individual’s resources for 
adapting to stressful events.[ADDRESS_3330] applications for cancer patients. Guided by [CONTACT_3717]’s 
broaden -and-build theor y of positive emotions22 and funded by [CONTACT_3718] 
(R01MH084723), Moskowitz’s RCT of a 5 -session evidence -based intervention is 
designed to teach skills for increasing the frequency and intensity of daily PA and 
to examine the intervention’s effects on subseq uent psychological well -being, 
health behaviors, and physical health after diagnosis with HIV. Patients with HIV 
experience similar negative and positive psychosocial sequelae as patients with 
cancer.19-22 This manualized web -based and home -delivered inter vention (LILAC) 
focused explicitly on increasing positive affect, and has shown good feasibility, 
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in people copi[INVESTIGATOR_3676] -
related stress  23,[ADDRESS_3331] cancer. Thus, 
Mosko witz’ empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -based PA intervention research may have beneficial

Informatics Group to identify potential CCCWFU patients from the electronic 
medical record  and/or cancer registry . Potentially eligible patients will be recruited 
through a dire ct in-clinic approach as well as mailed letters followed by a phone 
call by a study team member. The recruitment call will be followed by [CONTACT_3720]  (EMPOWER)  
Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University (CCCWFU)

 outlining the details discussed during the phone call and instructions on next steps 
and a link to the screen ing questionnaire ( Recruitment Email Script ).  IRB-
approved s tudy flyers will be placed in the community at large, the Comprehensive 
Cancer Center at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and other strategic locations 
associated with Wake Forest Baptist Medic al Center . IRB-approved study flyers  
may also be disseminated through email blasts or posting s on websites of local 
cancer support agencies such as Cancer Services.  
 
Patients will then be screened for eligibility using an online screening questionnaire 
on Qualtrics.  Those that are ineligible will be displayed a message stating that 
he/she was ineligible. Patients who are eligible based will be navigated to the 
consent form and initial study questionnaire on Qualtrics, an online data collection 
tool that e nables researchers to create study -specific websites for capturing patient  
data securely online. The instrument library includes self -report batteries or profiles 
from Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
and the NIH Toolbox wh ich include many of the measures that will be used in the 
study.  At completion of the baseline questionnaire, all patients  will be given access 
to the PA intervention.  
The PA intervention is a 5 session online intervention that teaches 8 skills for 
incre asing the frequency of positive emotions: 1) noting daily positive events25-28 
2) capi[INVESTIGATOR_3678];29-30 3) gratitude;31-33 4)

which patients ’ past res ponses are displayed next to their new ones, so that every 
time the patient  visits that exercise they see their growing list of past positive 
experiences. Patients will be permitted up to [ADDRESS_3340]-intervention phone interview with all patients  approximately one week after 
the intervention is complete to gather accep tability data .  The semi -structured 
interview includes questions where participants rank the skill sessions  in terms of 
favorite topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], the likelihood of referral to others (a friend or someone diagnosed 
with cancer) and the likelihood of practicing learn ed skills.  There is also a section 
with open -ended questions, including questions about participant experiences with 
use of the website  and home practice exercises  
Patient  Incentives. Each patient  will be paid $10 for each completed assessment 
for a maxim um of $30. Patients  will be paid in full upon completion of the study via

content will be assessed via multiple -choice "quiz" questions within each lesson. If 
patients  are not able to answer a question, it will trigger a review of the relevant 
material ( patients  can also choose to review past material at any time). How 
frequently patients  visit the webs ite and how many times they complete the daily 
practice exercises for each skill  will also be recorded . This information can be used 
in "dose -response" analyses to determine whether greater exposure to the 
exercises leads to stronger intervention effects.  Patient  progress  will be monitored

5.0 Study Outcome s and Study  Measures  
 
Patients will complete self -report questionnaires at baseline (pre -test), 
approximately 8 weeks after baseline (post -test), then at 12 weeks (follow -up) for 
a total of 3 assessments, each lasting approximately 25 -30 minutes. All 
measures will be completed from home via patients ’ personal computers. In 
addition to the measures listed below, key demographics will be assessed 
(race/ethnicity, education, household income, insurance status), cancer type, 
time since diagnosis, type of treatment, and time since treatment (See Appendix 
[ADDRESS_3343] of measures).  
 
5.1  Primary Outcomes  
 
The primary outcomes for this study are measures of feasibility – accrual, 
refusal, retention, adherence and acceptability.  
 
5.2 Secondary Outcomes  
 
5.2.1  Health -Related Quality of Life (HRQOL).  The PROMIS global health items 
will be used to assess overa ll HRQOL,68 and the PROMIS -2969-70 to assess 
domain -specific aspects of HRQOL. The PROMIS Global scale consists of 
10 items that assess general health, including overall physical and mental 
health. The PROMIS -29 consists of 29 items that assess physical 
functioning, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social 
ENHANCING MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES WITH

Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University (CCCWFU)  
CCCWFU [ADDRESS_3344] to 
psychological well -being and positively associated with better patient -
reported outcomes.  
5.2.3 Health Behaviors.  Healthy behaviors often associated with enhanced 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_3679].75 Physical health behaviors 
will include: diet,[ADDRESS_3345] all data analysis.  
 
6.1 Analysis of Primary Objective  
Accrual will be estimated as the number of patients  accrued divided by [CONTACT_3723]. A 95% confidence interval for the monthly accrual rate will 
be calculated based on the Poisson distribution. The refusal rate will be estimated 
as the number of patients who refuse to participate divided by [CONTACT_3724]. 
Retention will be primarily defined as the proportion of patients  who provide 8 week 
and 12 week data. Patients  who discontinue the intervention (refuse phone calls) 
but complete the outcome assessments will be counted in the numerator for 
calculating retention. Retention estimates will be calculated overall and by [CONTACT_3725]. 
Adherence to the intervention will be calculated as the number of intervention 
sessions completed, the frequency of completing exercises, and number of 
website visits. We will calculate and report the mean adherence across all 
individuals as well as the proportion of patients  who completed three or more 
sessions. Several measures will be used to quantify acceptability, including 
quantitative measures and interview. Means and the proportion responding 
affirmatively to the highest two responses for e ach question will be combined and 
exact 95% CIs will be calculated for these estimates. In addition, [CONTACT_3738] and 
[CONTACT_3739] will review open -ended (written) feedback and audio -recordings of 
phone interviews to identify meta -themes and determine satu ration of concepts.78

 6.2  Analysis of Secondary Objective  
 
Quantitative outcomes will be assessed by a covariance pattern model for 
repeated measures to examine change in PA and PROMIS scores over time.  
 
6.2 Power and Sample Size  
 
While this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_3680], 
we do want to be able to estimate feasibility, acceptability, and changes in PA and 
PROMIS scores with a fair degree of precision. With a total of 60 patients  we can 
estimate confidence intervals around means  to within ±0.25 SD, and proportions 
within ±12.7% , with 95% confidence. Assuming that 20% of the patients  may drop 
out, we could estimate confidence intervals for means within ±0.28 SD and 
proportions within ±14.1%  for measures evaluated at the end of the study. 
Furthermore, t he sample size of N=[ADDRESS_3346] TLS/SSL encryption. Another layer of security will be provided

Planning for continued practice  
 
For this last section, I’d like to talk about continued practice of the skills we covered. A basic 
premise of these copi[INVESTIGATOR_3716].  
Again these skills are like muscles, if you don’t exercise them, they aren’t likely to work 
very well. For these skills to be beneficial to you, you need to make them habits.  
 
 
 
 
  It sounds like you plan to continue (XX skill from abov e participant is going to practice most 
frequently) but are less likely to continue (XX skill from above participant is going to 
practice less).  First let’s talk about the one that you plan to continue.  What about it is 
appealing to you?  How do you plan  to fit it into your day and make it a habit?   
 
 
 
 
How about your least favorite skill?  Can you tell me what about that one makes you less likely 
to try and incorporate it into your life?  
 
 
  
  
 
One of the interesting things about any new skill is that aft er a while you might get bored with it 
or it may stop having the same impact that it had initially.  If (skill participant rates as 
most likely to continue) starts getting old for you, you should go back to the skills and 
choose another one and increase yo ur practice of that one.  Let’s talk about (XX skill that 
participant rated the second most likely to practice) and ways you might be able to 
incorporate that into your daily life.   
 
 
*********************************************************************** ****  
Questions about website usage:  
 
Can you talk about your experience using the intervention website?  
Probe: What features did you like?  
      What could have been clearer?  
 
 
What did you think of the at home practice exercises?  
 
 
If the participant did not progress through all the lessons  
Why did you stop at lesson X?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In about four  weeks (cite specific dates), I will email you the final online questionnaire for the 
study. This will mark the end of your participation in the study.   
 
Are th ere any questions I can answer for you now?  
 
Thank you again for your time and participation in this study. We really appreciate it!

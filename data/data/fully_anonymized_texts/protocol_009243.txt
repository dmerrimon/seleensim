 1.0 Background  & Rationale  
 
Specialized Navy personnel are required to undertake duties while immersed in cold water for 
prolong periods. These dives regularly require the use of external thermal protection (i.e., wet 
suits and dry suits). However, external thermal protection during prolonged cold -water diving is 
often times insufficient to maintain body temperature and thermal comfort, ther eby [CONTACT_768523]. Accordingly, developi[INVESTIGATOR_893784] -water immersion is of important interest 
to Navy divers and special forces.  
 
Mirabegron (Myrbetriq®, extended -release tablet, Astellas Pharma), is a medication approved by 
[CONTACT_768524]; the mechanism of 
action is stimulation of the beta -3-adrenergic receptor  (1). However, mirabegron has additional 
effects that include the activation of beta -3-adrenergic receptors located on brown adipose 
tissue (1). Brown adipose tissue is considered to be highly thermogenic and contributes to non -
shivering thermogenesis (i.e. the generation of heat in the absence of movement). Recent 
evidence indicates that resting energy expenditure (a direct reflection of thermogenesis) and 
supraclavicular skin temperature (an indicator of brow n adipose tissue activation) are elevated 
for 3-4 hours after the acute administration of mirabegron in single doses ranging from 100 mg 
to 200 mg (2). However, it is not known which dose of mirabegron exerts the longest lasting 
thermogenic effects. Importantly, plasma concentrations of mirabegron peak 3 -4 hours after 
administration (3, 4)  and the biological half -life of mirabegron is 40 -50 hours (4). Thus, the 
thermogenic effects of mirabegron might extend past [ADDRESS_1252008] longer than 4 hours.  
 
2.0 Objective(s)  
2.1 Primary Objective s 
Specific Aim 1:  
a. Determine if acute mirabegron administration will increase thermogenesis during [ADDRESS_1252009] 
increases in thermogenesis during 6 hours of a mild cold stress challenge.  
 Specific Aim 2 : 
a.  Determine if acute mirabegron administration will delay the fall in core temperature 
during a progressive cold -water immersion challenge.  
b. To determine if acute mirabegron administration will delay the onset of shivering during 
a progressive cold -water immersion challenge.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objective  
Specific Aim 1:  
Determine if core temperature, mean skin temperature (6 thermocouples), heart rate 
(ECG), blood pressure (brachial artery auscultation), indices of shivering (e.g., oxygen 
consumption, surface mechanomyography (using 3 triaxial accelerometers) and the 
bedside shivering assessment scale), thermal perceptions (thermal comfort and thermal 
sensation), and brown adipose tissue activation using infrared thermography  are 
influenced by [CONTACT_768525] 6 hours of a mild cold stress challenge.

  Specific Aim 2:  
Determine if the shivering inflection point during the progressive cold -water immersion 
challenge  is shifted following mirabegron ingestion .  
 
2.3 Tertiary/Exploratory/Correlative Objectives  
Specific Aim 3:  
To determine if variations in gut microbiome and their metabolites between participants 
explains the variability associated with different doses of acute mirabegron 
administration.  
 
We will correlate measures of body composition derived from dual -energy X -ray 
absorptiometry  (DEXA) to primary and secondary outcome measures.  
 
3.0 Outcome Measures /Endpoints  
3.1 Primary Outcome Measures  
Specific Aim 1:  
Thermogenesis (i.e., r esting energy expenditure ) and thermogenesis area under the curve

-Increases in heart rate and blood pressure are common with the higher 
doses of mirabegron that we will be testing. Additionally, medications that 
influence vasomotor activity may also influence thermoregulation. 
Therefore, for participant safety, we do not  want to study participants that 
are taking a medication that might interfere with our ability to properly 
monitor and interpret the potential side effects of mirabegron during cold 
exposure.

 Timeline of Procedures  
 
Specific Aim 1  
• Informed Consent/Screening Visit:  Once participants arrive at the laboratory, an 
investigator will obtain written informed consent after all procedures and study risks are 
fully explained and all questions answered. After obtaining written informed consent, 
participants will complete a Hea lth History and Demographics Questionnaire, an 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Physical Activity Readiness 
Questionnaire (PAR -Q+). An experienced investigator will administer these 
questionnaires. These individuals can fully explain a ny technical terms and answer any 
inquiries related to the questionnaire. A resting heart rate and arm blood pressure 
measurement will be done after the questionnaires are complete. Participants will then 
have their body composition measured using DEXA.  If DEXA cannot be performed during 
this visit, an additional visit can be scheduled. Participants will also visit with [CONTACT_768542] 
to review medical history and resting blood pressure and heart rate measurements to 
review any contraindications for taking mir abegron. The visit with [CONTACT_768542] can be in 
person or through a scheduled Zoom call to reduce participant scheduling burden. In the 
case of a Zoom call, [CONTACT_768542] will be provided the medical history and resting blood 
pressure and heart rate measurements prior to the call.  
 
• Study Visits:  Mirabegron has a half -life of ~[ADDRESS_1252020] (237 ml Ensure Original; 220 kcal) upon arrival and be instrumented 
for skin temperature ( 12-sites: calf, shin, front of the thigh, back of the thigh, chest, 
upper back, forehead, lower back, abdomen, forearm, hand, and foot ; iButtons) core 
temperature (rectal thermistor), indices of shivering (surface mechanomyography using 
triaxial accelerometers at 3 anatomic sites (chest, upper back, and thigh) and the 
bedside shivering assessment scale), brachial artery blood pressure (brachial artery 
auscultation), and heart rate (3 -lead ECG). Thermal perceptions will be assessed using 
Likert scales for thermal discomfort and thermal sensation. Participants wil l be shirtless 
(sports bra for women) and will wear shorts throughout the study. After 20 minutes of 
quiet resting in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], 5 minutes of baseline measurements will be taken, 
thermal perceptions and an infrared thermography image of the supraclavicular fossa 
will be obtained as an indicator of brown adipose tissue activation  (6), and a whole 
blood sample will be obtained . Whole blood samples will be allowed to clot at room 
temperature (~15 -30 minutes). The clot will be removed via centrifuging the samples at 
1,500 g for 10 minutes. The serum samples will then be frozen ( -80°C)  until they are 
shipped on dry ice to Rutgers University for analysis.  Participants will then ingest 
mirabegron (100 mg, 150 mg, or 200 mg) or placebo . Thirty minutes after mirabegron 
or placebo has been ingested , participants will enter the whole -body indirect 
calorimeter; the internal temperature of the calorimeter will be set to 20 C (68F). This 
will elicit a mild cold stress over the [ADDRESS_1252021] calorimeter provides an accurate and continuous

Thermogenesis will be determined by [CONTACT_768532][INVESTIGATOR_2525] 30 minutes and 
resting energy expenditure will be calculated using the abbreviated Weir formula  every 
hour (5). Thermal perceptions and an infrared thermography image will also be obtained 
at these time points. At approximately the midpoint of the [ADDRESS_1252023] calorimeter and final measurements of skin 
temperature, core temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure will be obtained as well 
as a final infrared thermography i mage  and a whole blood sample . After the study, 
participants will be g iven a mylar blanket to re -warm themselves prior to leaving the 
laboratory.  Participants will be given a fecal collection kit that they will take with them. 
Instructions will be provided  (both verbal and written)  on the proper handling of their 
sample . If participants complete the informed consent/screening visit and all study visits , 
we expect that they will spend a total of ~33 hours in the study.  
 
Specific Aim 2  
• Informed Consent/Screening Visit:  Once participants arrive at the laboratory, an 
investigator will obtain written informed consent after all procedures and study risks are 
fully explained and all questions answered. After obtaining written informed consent, 
participants will complete a Hea lth History and Demographics Questionnaire, an 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Physical Activity Readiness 
Questionnaire (PAR -Q+). An experienced investigator will administer these 
questionnaires. These individuals can fully explain a ny technical terms and answer any 
inquiries related to the questionnaire. A resting heart rate and arm blood pressure 
measurement will be done after the questionnaires are complete. Participants will then 
have their body composition measured using DEXA.  If DEXA cannot be performed during 
this visit, an additional visit can be scheduled. Participants will also visit with [CONTACT_768542] 
to review medical history and resting blood pressure and heart rate measurements to 
review any contraindications for taking mir abegron. The visit with [CONTACT_768542] can be in

 empty water immersion tank. T hen they will be instrumented for the measurement of 
heart rate (3 -lead ECG), blood pressure (brachial artery auscultation), core temperature 
(rectal thermistor), and indices of shivering (surface mechanomyography using triaxial 
accelerometers at 3 anatomic sites  (chest, upper back, and thigh) , oxygen consumption 
via ventilation and expi[INVESTIGATOR_299353] , and the bedside shivering assessment scale). Thermal 
perceptions will be assessed using Likert scales for thermal discomfort and ther mal 
sensation.  Following [ADDRESS_1252025] either mirabegron (100 mg) or a placebo 
tablet. The dose of mirabegron will be determined from the re sults of Specific Aim 1. 
The dose of mirabegron the elicits the greatest increase in thermogenesis in Specific Aim 
1 will be used in Specific Aim 2. The measurement of supraclavicular fossa skin 
temperature (infrared thermography) and thermal perceptions will be assessed every [ADDRESS_1252026], 
pre-immersion measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, core temperature, 
shivering, and thermal perceptions will be  conducted a nd an infrared thermography 
image will be taken. Then, the water immersion tank will be filled up to the participant’s 
neck with 35C (95F) water. Heart rate, blood pressure, core temperature,  and 
shivering indices will be continuously measured . Infrared thermography and  thermal 
perceptions will be obtained every 5 minutes throughout the progressive cold -water 
challenge. The water will be cooled at a rate of 12C per hour until the water 
temperature reaches 10 C (50F), the participant can no longer tolerate the cold water , 
or core temperature reaches 35 .5C (95.9F). This is 0.5 C higher than the clinical 
definition of hypothermia. Also, the risks associated with hypothermia are core body 
temperature -dependent and not dependent on time  (7). Upon completion of the 
progressive cold water challenge, the water in the tank will be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_768520]. 
Participants will gently towel dry and will  be able to  don a circulating warm water 
perfused suit and/or use a mylar blanket to reestablish core temperature.  If participants 
complete the informed consent/screening visit and all study visits, we expect that they 
will spend a total of ~11 hours in the study.

1 will be used for the Specific Aim 3. Serum samples will be frozen at -80C until they 
are shipped on dry ice to Rutgers University for analyses. Participants will be give n the 
option to directly send their fecal samples to Rutgers University  (shippi[INVESTIGATOR_768521]) or they can bring their samples in to the lab and a staff member will ship 
the samples to Rutgers University. All samples will be de -identi fied.

procedures.   
• Core temperature drops below 35.0°C  
• Infection at venous blood draw site  
• Loss of confidentiality  
• Injury requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or activation of EMS.  
• Death  
 
Other events deemed as events occurring outside the criteria above will be reported to the IU 
IRB reported within [ADDRESS_1252028] operating procedures. If any event occurs 
that would potentially impair the health of the participant , the experiment will  be halted, and the 
IRB will be notified.  
 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all the following criteria will also be reported:  
(1) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given  
a. the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, 
such as the  IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent  document ; and  
b. the characteristics of the participant  population being studied;  
(2) related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, 
possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or 
outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); an d  
(3) suggests that the research places participants  or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Participants  will be informed of possible risks before consenting to participate through the 
informed consent document. Details of foreseeable risks and discomforts for the procedures, and 
steps taken to lessen the probability and/or magnitude of these risks are noted  below.  
 
• Acute Mirabegron ingestion : Mirabegron ingestion in the population that will be 
studied is deemed safe (3) and will be prescribed under the direction of our study 
physician, [CONTACT_768543] . The doses that will be used in this study have mild 
cardiovascular (heart rate and blood pressure) effects  that are associated  with the 
dose of mirabegron (e.g., the greater the dose of mirabegron, the greater the 
cardiovascular response  (2, 3) . Acute oral administration of 200 mg of mirabegron has 
been shown to increase h eart rate by ~8 beats per minute  and systolic blood pressure 
by ~10 mmHg with no changes in diastolic blood pressure  (2). These increases in 
heart rate and blood pressure are far below the heart rate and blood pressure

 responses associated with moderate to heavy exercise intensit ies that are achieved in 
healthy 18 -40 year old men and women .  
 
• Head Out Water Immersion : Water temperature during Specific Aim 2  will be 
perceived as being cold and rectal temperature will decrease and participants might 
shiver. We will constantly monitor rectal temperature during the study visits for 
Specific Aim 2 . Any risks are reversible with removal from the cold water and warming 
with warm water perfused suits and/or mylar  blankets, which are located in the 
laboratory. The protocol  will be immediately terminated if core temperature drops to 
35.5°C or if the participant does not want to continue.  This safety cutoff is  0.5C 
higher than the clinical definition of hypothermia  and we don’t expect core 
temperature to drop to 35.5 C. For instance, 60 minutes of 15C water immersion 
decreased core temperature less than 1 C (8). Another study safely had participants 
sit in 10C (50F) water up to the mid -sternum for 90 minutes and core temperature 
only decreased to 36.2C (9). In a case study, 88 minutes of full body immersion in 
crushed ice lowered core temperature from 37. 6C to 37.0C (10). Also, the risks 
associated with hypothermia are core body temperature -dependent and do not appear 
to be dependent on time  (7).  
 
• Whole  blood sample:  Participants will likely experience discomfort during venous blood 
draws and in rare circumstances may feel lightheaded or faint. This risk will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_768533] -recumbent or supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251]. There is a rare ri sk of infection following venous blood draws. This risk will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_768534].  
 
• Rectal temperature : There is a n extremely low risk  of rectal perforation . This risk will 
be minimized by [CONTACT_768535], while rectal temperature will not be measured 
in participants with any known chronic (e.g., cancer, surgery, etc) or acute conditions 
(e.g., diarrhea, constipation, etc.) (or history of disorders) o f the rectum. The 
temperature probe will be self -inserted during instrumentation processes and removed 
prior to the participant leaving the laboratory. Any risks will be reversed with removal.  
 
• Loss of confidentiality : There is a potential risk for loss of confidentiality. Every effort 
will be made to keep all subject information confidential. This risk will be alleviated by 
[CONTACT_768536] -identified information.  
 
• Other risks : There may be other risks that we cannot predict.

 Data will be monitored by [CONTACT_696737]. Thus, analysis of data will be performed without 
any identifying features to individuals. Statistical software will be used to analyze data for 
significance. Results will be reported through traditional scientific outlets such as peer -reviewed 
manuscript and presentations at national and international meetings. Communication with the 
IRB regarding safety will be reported directly by [CONTACT_458].  
 
11.0  Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
Participants  can voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_768537] (personal contact, email, phone, etc.). If a 
researcher on the project wishes to withdraw a participant  from the study, they will contact [CONTACT_768538] (personal contact, phone, email, etc.). Possible indications for withdrawal by 
a researcher include a change in their health history that excludes them from participation and 
an inability to keep appointments or follow or understand the rules of t he protocol. Data collected 
up to the time of withdraw (either voluntary or by [CONTACT_3476]) may be used for analysis.  
 
12.0  Statistical Considerations  
 
Specific Aim 1  
Power Analysis:  Using data from Loh et al. (2) we expect to observe an effect size ( f) of 0.[ADDRESS_1252030] size, 10 participants will be needed to achieve a power of 0.99 
with an alpha level set at 0.05. To account for possible attrition, we plan on recruiting up to 30 
participants . 
 
Statistical Approach:  We will compare the primary (i.e., thermogenesis) and secondary (i.e., 
core temperature, skin temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, indices of shivering, thermal 
perceptions, and infrared thermography images) dependent variables using mixed effects 
ANOV A (i.e., mirabegron dose x time) followed by [CONTACT_397618]’s post hoc procedure if a significant 
interaction or main effect is found from the ANOVA analyses. We will also calculate the 
thermogenesis area under the curve for each dose of mirabegron. These values wi ll be 
compared using repeated measures ANOVA followed by [CONTACT_397618]’s post hoc procedure if a 
significant main effect is found from the ANOVA analysis. We will also perform correlation 
analyses to determine the relation between body composition and our primary and secondary 
dependent variables. The alpha level will be set at P < 0.05 for all analyses.  
 
Specific Aim 2  
Power Analysis:  Similar to Specific Aim 1  and the data from Loh et al. (2), we expect to observe 
an effect size ( f) of 0.[ADDRESS_1252031] size, 10 participants will be needed to 
achieve a power of 0.99 with an alpha level set at 0.05. To account for possible attrition, we 
plan on recruiting up to 30 participants . 
 
Statistical Approach:  The primary (i.e., core temperature deflection point) and secondary (i.e., 
onset of shivering inflection point) dependent variables from the mirabegron and placebo trials 
will be compared using paired t -tests to determine if mirabegron improves cold -water 
immersion tolerance. Mixed effects ANOVA will be used to compare the remaining dependent 
variables between conditions (i.e., mirabegron vs. placebo) and across time. If a significant

Version Date: [ADDRESS_1252032]. The alpha level will be set at P < 0.05 for all 
analyses.        
 
Specific Aim 3  
Power Analysis:  This aim is being conducted as an exploratory aim in conjunction with Specific 
Aim [ADDRESS_1252033] size ( f) of 0.[ADDRESS_1252034] size, 10 participants will be needed to achieve a power of 0.99 with an alpha level set 
at 0.05. To account for possible attrition, we plan on recruiting up to 30 participants.  
 
Statistical Approach:  
Principal Coordinate Analysis will be performed with group samples and any outliers will be 
identified. T -tests, and/or ANOVA will be performed to identify significant differences. Statistical 
analysis to detect variation between samples will be carried ou t using student t -test or Mann –
Whitney test depending on data distribution. Multivariate statistics will be incorporated in a 
web-based tool Metastats, which can reveal, with high confidence, discriminatory functions 
between the replicated metagenome datas et of the gut microbiota of humans. In addition, the 
ShotgunFunctionalizeR and/or Primer E packages will be used for this analysis.  
 
13.0  Statistical Data Management  
 
Primary data will be collected via a data acquisition system ( PowerLab) and stored electronically 
on a password protected computer.  The storage location will be backed up manually every 
week.  Quality assurance steps will be confirmed by [CONTACT_768539]. 
Outliers will be identified and che cked for authenticity in the database and other original data 
documents. Extraction and cleaning of data that will be used for analysis will be carried out 
after each study visit.  
14.0  Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Informed consent will be obtained, and the testing procedures will be completed in a closed, 
private laboratory setting at the School of Public Health (SPH), with only the participant and 
investigators present.  
 
All testing will take place in a closed, private laboratory setting in the School of Public Health.  
All participants will be assigned an identification number, which will then be used when 
recording and analyzing data. A code list containing the participa nts names and identification 
numbers will be stored separately in a locked filing cabinet and will only be available to the 
investigators. The reports generated as a result of this investigation will not identify individual 
subjects. Data will be collected  and stored on password protected computers located in the 
Human Performance Laboratories, which are always kept locked. Any paper data will be stored 
in a locked filing cabinet inside a locked office. Primary data are backed up by [CONTACT_768540], which is then stored in a separate locked office in a 
locked filing cabinet accessible only to the investigators.  
 
While testing is in progress, a sign will be outside the laboratory door to prevent people not 
associated with the study from entering.  
IRB#: [PHONE_16031]  
 
Version Date: [ADDRESS_1252035] Retention  
 
We anticipate that all participants will be enrolled within 24 months. Any identifiable data (e.g., 
signed consent forms) will be maintained as required by [CONTACT_2371]. De -identified data will be stored 
indefinitely. Only investigators will have full access to data. All electronic data will be kept on 
password protected comp uters, while paper data will remain in locked file cabinets.

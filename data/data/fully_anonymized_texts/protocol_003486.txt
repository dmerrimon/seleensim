Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page [ADDRESS_827201] thyroid gland removal alone to 
those who receive thyroid gland removal  plus lymph node surgery in the central neck.  
 
In this clinical trial, 70 - 140 patients undergoing surgery treatment for thyroid cancer will be enrolled 
into one of three treatment arms. Patients receiving  total thyroidectomy for papi[INVESTIGATOR_6686] 
(PTC) with no pre -operative evidence of distant or cervical lymph node metastasis will be randomized 
into one of two arms: prophylactic central neck dissection or no central neck dissection. Patients who 
are not eligible for randomization will be enrolled into a third standard of care arm. We will then 
compare the three cohorts : (1) To determine the rate of transient and per sistent hypocalcemia; (2) To 
determine the rate of voice and swallowing problems; (3) To determine the degree to which HR -QOL is 
compromised; (4) To determine clinical recurrence rates ; (5) To determine the degree to which Natural 
Language Processing (NLP)  tools can extract and document quality of life measures from patient 
interview narratives; (6) To determine the extent of correlation among  quality of life measures obtained 
from patient interview narratives and  those from traditionally administered quality of life surveys.

Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page 8 of 34 1. Introduction  
 
1.1. Background  
Each year in the [LOCATION_002] 46,670 new cases  of thyroid cancer are diagnosed . The incidence  of 
thyroid cancer in the [LOCATION_002] has increased nearly 2.4 -fold from 1950 to  2000 . It is therefore 
critically important that treatments for this disease are grounded in high levels of research  evidence.  
 
Currently, complete removal of the thyroid (total thyroidectomy) is the primary treatment for papi[INVESTIGATOR_226796]  (PTC) .  A prophylactic  (preventative) central neck dissection  to remove the lymph nodes 
near the thyroid  is also often performed along with the total thyroidectomy.    
 
A therapeutic central neck dissection (CND) is performed if there is evidence  of lymph no de involvement 
on pre -operative ultrasound or on intra -operative inspection. The removal of  clearly  involved lym ph 
nodes is believed to provide a therapeutic benefit and to aid in local control of disease.  
 
A prophylactic CND is somewhat different be cause it involves removing lymph nodes that  are empi[INVESTIGATOR_621369] , and if  
removed, will decrease the risk of recurrence. It is well established that central neck lymph nodes 
harbor  microscopic lymph node involve ment in 60% of cases.  However, it has never been shown in a  
prospective study that prophylactic CND decreases recurrence or improves survival.  
 
The role of prophylactic CND is one of the biggest clinical questions in the management of thyroid  
cancer  today. With over [ADDRESS_827213] the  patient at risk for serious and pervasive deficits in communicative function, nutrition, 
hydration , and h ealth  related  quality of life (HR -QOL). Hypoparathyroidism can also result and may lead 
to life -threatening hypocalcemia that requires medications four  or more times a day. These 
complications can be devastating, especially for young patients who will have  to accommodate these 
consequences for the rest of their  lives. However, r emoval of lymph nodes by [CONTACT_3553]  a prophylactic 
CND  at the initial operation may decrease the need for repeat surgery and its associated higher risks .  
 
This debate came to the forefront when the American Thyroid Association ( ATA) issued  conse nsus 
guidelines in 2006  that recommended consideration of a prophylactic CND in all patients with  thyroid 
cancer. These guidelines were based on retrospective studies  using historical controls because  higher 
levels of evidence were lacking.  After the guidelines wer e published, there was a flurry of further 
retrospective studies performed in attempt to either support or refu te that recommendation.  
The 2006 ATA practice guidelines were partially revised in 2009 to  “recommend,” based on expert 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], an even lower level of evidence than the retrospective study designs  found in the previous 
literature. Unfortunately, there remain limited data to either support or refute the [ADDRESS_827214] needs a 
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page [ADDRESS_827215] of surgery and surgical co mplications on quality of life, we would 
like to offer patients not eligible for the randomization  arms or those that are unable to be randomized 
intraoperatively the ability to participate in the study in the SOC arm . 
 
Background on Natural L anguage Proce ssing of patient interview narratives : 
 
Traditionally, clinicians and researchers measure quality of life using one of several structured quality of 
life surveys. Such tools can become time -consuming and expensive to employ for research or clinical 
use. Fu rthermore, these surveys require patients to answer structured questionnaires about their health 
rather than to simply describe their experience in a more natural, narrative format.  
 
Patient use of electronic health resources and health -related social med ia sites has increased 
significantly in the past few years. These resources offer the opportunity for patients to share their 
experiences in a more natural, narrative format. Making this existing information available to clinicians 
in a validated, standard ized format will result in: 1) improved communication between patient and 
physician, 2) efficient longitudinal tracking of quality of life measures within an electronic medical 
record, and 3) retrieval and coding of quality of life data contained in narrat ive social media content.  By 
[CONTACT_621392] (NLP) techniques to patient narratives collected in our qualitative 
interviews, we will be able to see if patients’ natural language  be linked to changes in their overall 
quality of life or other factors that could affect patient care.  
 
1.2. Rationale and h ypothesis  
We propose a clinical trial in which  70 - 140 patients undergoing surgery  for PTC  with no pre -operative 
evidence of distant metastasis will be enrolled into one of three  treatment arms : total thyroidectomy  
with prophylactic central neck dissection, total thyroidectomy without central neck dissection  or 
standard of care. The total thyroidectomy patients will be randomized into one of  the first  two arms . 
The standard of care patients, patients who are not eligible for the randomization arm s pre-operatively 
or are unable to be randomized intraoperatively , will be enrolled into the third study arm and will  not 
have any aspect of their cancer care modified by [CONTACT_621393]. In the absence of this  
clinical trial, patients seen at our center would be offered a total thyroidectomy  without central neck 
dissection , which is our current p ractice standard . At many other major academic centers , however,  a 
prophylactic central neck dissection is the standard of care.  Currently about 50% of high volum e 
institutions are doing a central neck dissection routinely in their practice. While performing a central 
neck dissection may increase the risks of surgery it may also decrease the risk of recurrence. We do not 
know , given the presently available data, which will be greater, and therefore this study has true clinical 
equipoise .  
 
Our hypothesis is that total  thyroidectomy with prophylactic central neck dissection will result  in a 
higher complication rate  in comparison with to tal thyroidectomy alone for papi[INVESTIGATOR_6686].  
 
2. Objectives  
 
2.1. Primary  outcome  and endpoint s  
 To determine the rate of transient and permanent  hypocalcemia : 
• Transient hypoparathyroidism as defined by a Day 1 serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level 
of <10 pg/ml  
• Post -operative serum calcium (mg/dL) and PTH (pg/ml) at Day 12  and Month  6 
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page 10 of 34 • Total calcium consumption in first 2 weeks (total gm)  
• Hypocalcemia  symptom s in first 2 weeks (average epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]/day)  
• Hypocalcemia symptom severity scale (range of 1 -5) 
• Requirement for calcium and calcitriol at Month  6 (or, if laboratory values at visit reveal 
calcium  < 8 mg/dL and PTH <15 pg/ml)  
 
Calcium and PTH levels, calcium intake, and hyp ocalcemia symptoms will be monitored post -operatively 
(at Day 1, Day 12 , and Month  6) to examine how parathyroid function is affected by a CND.  
Hypoparathyroidism can lead to paresthesias and muscle cramps and is a known complication of total 
thyroidectomy, requiring frequent treatment with calcium and vitamin D. This risk is incre ased with a 
CND and is thus important to quantify when examining the risk/benefit ratio . Because calcium 
supplementation is routinely administered for symptoms of hypocalcemia in the post -operative period 
and this may impact the interpretation of laboratory evaluations, we will be evaluating a variety of 
metrics to assess the incidence and impact of hypocalcemia on patients.  
 
2.2. Secondary outcomes  and endpoints  
To determine the rate of voice and swallowing problems , patients will receive videofluoroscopic  
swallowing studies and voice evaluations pre -operatively and post -operatively ( at Day 12 , Week 6, 
Month  6, and 1 Year visits ) to examine how voice and swallow function are affected by [CONTACT_621394] a 
CND.  Voice and/or swallow evaluations may be eliminated o nce necessary endpoints  have been satisfied 
or the evaluation  is no longer informative.1  
 
• Phonation Threshold Pressure (cm  H2O) 
• Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI; +5 to - 5) 
• GRBAS (grade roughness breathiness asthe nia strain)  
• CAPE -V (0-100 on visual analog scale for voice quality parameters)  
• Stroboscopy assessment (ratings 1 [most severe] to 4 [normal]) for vocal fold vibratory and  
movement parameters  
• Glottal Function Index score 
• Penetration -Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_127353] (0 -8 score) from videofluoroscopic swallow study1 
 
To determine the degree to which quality of life (QOL) is compromised , qualitative analyses of patient 
interview data and validated surveys of general health quality, a s well as  QOL surveys specific to cancer, 
thyroid disease, voice and  swallowing will be  used to assess the impact of complications on patient’s 
lives.  
• SF-12 MCS and PCS scores  
• EORTC QLQ C30 scale scores  
• ThyCA -QOL  score  
• EAT-10 dysphagia inventory score  
• VHI score  (collected by [CONTACT_621395]’s voice evaluation , and 
by [CONTACT_621396] ) 
• Themes, codes from interview transcripts (using qualitative research methods)  
 
                                                 
 
1 With the elimination of swallow studies for patients enrolled after  12/01/2016 collection of data for this endpoint 
ceased.  
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page 11 of 34 To determine whether accurate quality of life measures can be extracted from patient interview 
narratives , patient interview d ata will be  converted into usable datasets  using natural language 
processing techniques and is then compared to QoL surveys specific to cancer and thyroid disease.  
• Interview transcripts  
• SF-12 MCS and PCS scores  
• EORTC QLQ30 scale scores  
• ThyCA -QoL score  
 
To determine clinical recurrence rates , measures of thyroglobulin levels ( a reliable surrogate marker for 
future recurrence ), and clinical evidence of recurrent disease (using either I -131 imaging or neck 
ultrasound ), will be made at Month  6 and 1 Year visits . 
• Percent of patients with a 1 Year recombinant thyroid -stimulating hormone (rTSH ) 
stimulated Thyroglobulin level <1 ng/ml  
• Unstimulated  Thyroglobulin just prior to beginning the Week 6 radioactive iodine treatment  
• Stimulated Thyroglobulin at the time of Week 6 radioactive iodine treatment  (if RAI is given ) 
• Unstimulated Thyroglobulin at M onth  6 >1 ng/mL  
• Stimulated Thyroglobulin at 1  Year  >2 ng/mL 
• Biopsy -proven disease identified on neck ultrasound or I -[ADDRESS_827216] until 10 
to 20 years after their initial treatment. For this reason, in order to capture true clinical recurrence rates, 
participants who rec eive a diagnosis of PTC, as confirmed by [CONTACT_621397], and continue to 
receive car e within the University of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621370] k as well as  Univers ity of Wisconsin’s  endocrine surgery outcomes database until their cancer 
recurs or they are lost to follow up.  
 
Radioactive iodine treatment, ultrasound, and thyroglobulin monitoring are all part of the standard 
treatment and follow up of thyroid cancer  for nodules >1cm . The only test that will be done for research 
purposes is to check the thyroglobulin level prior to radioactive iodine, so that we can assess the 
completeness of surgical excision prior to administering radioactive iodine.  
 
3. Study design  
This study will compare  total thyroidectomy which is the standard of care treatment for PTC at the 
University of W isconsin  with total thyroidectomy with prophylactic  CND to also remove the lymph nodes 
near the thyroid . Both  surgical procedures are widely practiced in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of 
thyroid cancer and it is not  known which procedure is best.  
 
Participant  Identification and Eligibility:  
Participants  will be primarily identified from  all of our University of Wisconsin endocrine surgery and 
otolaryngology clinics .  
 
Eligible patients will have a thyroid nodule >1 cm in size that is  consistent with or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_621371] a 
pre-operati ve biopsy. All biopsies will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_621398]. Patients with T4 
(tumor of any size that extends beyond the thyroid) tumors , history of degenerative neurological 
diseases, pre-operative vocal cord paralysis or other vocal cord pathology will be excluded.  All patients 
will undergo a comprehensive neck ultrasound to evaluate for lymphadenopathy by [CONTACT_621399]. A comprehensive evaluation of lymph nodes in levels [ADDRESS_827217] lymph node involvement they will be ineligible for the randomization arm s. 
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page [ADDRESS_827218] elected to undergo total thyroidectomy for the randomization arm s. 
Patients who are eligible for the trial but not for randomization (i.e. have evidence of lymph node 
disease or are choosing a thyroid lobectomy) will be approached for conse nt into the standard of care 
arm.  
 
Pre-Operative Screening and Testing: Pre-operative laboratory testing will include calcium, PTH, and 
Vitamin D testing (Aim 1), a comprehensive voice and swallow1 evaluation (Aim 2), and a complete  
quality of life evaluation using validated questionnaires and semi -structured interviews (Aim 3). Patients 
eligible for  the randomization  arms will then be randomly assigned - after intraoperative confirmation of 
no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_621372]  - to one of two treatments on the day of surgery ; Arm  
1: total  thyroidectomy alone , or Arm  2: total thyroidectomy with ipsilateral prophylactic CND. 
Randomization will be  stratified by [CONTACT_621400]. Allocation schedule  will not be known to study staff prior to consenting.   
 
Operative Procedure:  Total thyroidectomy will be performed using standard techniques in all patients 
potentially eligible for randomization . An open  technique will be used to remove the entire thyroid 
including pyr amidal lobe and all visible  thyroid tissue. Care will be taken to visualize and preserve both 
recurrent laryngeal nerves and to preserve all  parathyroids in situ. All removed specimens will be 
carefully examined for any parathyroid tissue and any  devascularized or resected normal parathyroid 
glands will be confirmed by [CONTACT_621401].  
 
For randomiz ation patients who do not have a pre -operative diagnosis confirming PTC, a frozen  section 
of the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_621373] (s) will be performed intra- operatively. If frozen section confirms PTC, the  
surgical procedure will continue and the patient will be randomized. If frozen section does not confirm 
cancer,  randomization will not occur,  and the operative procedure will continue according to clinical 
indication. During  surgery, unexpected and suspi[INVESTIGATOR_621374]. If lymph node 
metastases are found, then  a CND would be performed at the discretion of the treating surgeon , and the 
patient will not be randomized.   If lymph node metastases are not found in the biopsy, and the surgeon 
would not otherwise perform a CND based on the observed suspi[INVESTIGATOR_621375], the participant will 
be randomized per protocol.  Once a patient has met both pre -operative intra- operative inclusion criteria 
and the randomization envelope is opened, he or she is enrolled in the study. Patients who screen fail 
intraoperatively will continue their participation  with the study as part of  the standard of care arm.  
 
Patients randomized to Arm [ADDRESS_827219]  where the i nnominate crosses the trachea. The superior 
parathyroid gland will be preserved in situ along with  its primary blood supply from the superior branch 
of the inferior thyroid artery. The inferior parathyroid gland  will be reflected laterally along with its 
blood supply from the inferior thyroid artery. Parathyroid  autotransplantation will be performed if the 
glands are devascularized during dissection. Paratracheal tissue  specimens will be examined for 
parathyroid glands that may be salvaged and transplanted before being removed fr om the sterile field. 
Suspected parathyroid glands will be confirmed by [CONTACT_621402].

identi cal. As such, the neck dressings are identical, allowing both the patients and study staff to be 
masked  with regard to treatment arm  randomization . Participants  will remain blinded to treatment arm 
until the Day [ADDRESS_827220] -operative instructions are identical for both arms , there is no risk associated 
with blinding the  patients until their Day 12  follow -up. Participants  who screen fail intra- operatively will 
be notified as to which procedure(s) was conducted immediately following surgery. The surgeon 
performing the procedure cannot and will not be blinded  to the participant’s treatment arm at any time . 
 
Post -operative follow -up: Post -operative follow -up will be done in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621376] -operative Day 1, 
and clinic follow up will occur at Day 12, Week 6, Month  6, and 1 Y ear. Patients will be  discharged with 
thyroid hormone that will be administered at 1.5 -1.7 mcg/kg daily. Patients will be  provided a 
hypocalcemia symptom log and will be requested to record their calcium intake and symptoms daily. 
When  they have symptoms they will be asked to record the t ime of the symptoms, what the symptoms 
were, the severity of the symptoms (scale of 1 -5), the amount of calcium taken to treat the symptoms, 
and the time to  symptom resolution.  
 
All patients will be seen in follow up in the clinic in approximately 2 weeks.  A calcium and PTH level will 
be obtained at that visit. Patients will be asked about their calcium intake and their  symptoms of 
hypocalcemia, and their symptom log will be reviewed by [CONTACT_464] (Aim 1). Their symptom  log will be 
collected at the two -wee k appointment and abstracted by [CONTACT_621403], the type and frequency of hypocalcemia symptoms, and the  
severity of those symptoms when they occurred.  
 
Comprehensive voice and swallow5 evaluation s will also be  performed at the Day 12 visit, and these 
evaluations will be repeated at  Week 6, Month  6, and 1  Year visits (Aim 2)  if abnormalities or complaints 
were noted at the previous time point . All of the voice assessments listed in secti on 2.[ADDRESS_827221] -operatively. If deficits are observed at 
Day 12, appropriate treatment will be provided . This may include watchful waiting, behavioral therapy, 
diet modification, use of injectables , or further surgery. Follow -up assessments at Week 6, Month  6, and 
1 Year will, in these cases, provide  preliminary data on treatment outcomes. Patients will also complete 
QOL  surveys  and interviews to determine  the effects (if any) of post -operative compl ications on overall 
well- being at each visit (Aim 3).   
 
It is difficult to coordinate voice and swallow evaluations with regularly scheduled patient visits. If the 
study team is unable to schedule these procedures on the same day, the subject is given the option of 
returning on a different day of his or her choosing or waiving the evaluation(s) in question at that time 
point. If an exam is missed, the exam will be scheduled at the subject’s next time point. To adequately 
address the secondary endpoints of t he study, the study staff only needs to know if the vocal cord is 
working and, if it is not working, if it recovers; this can be assessed with only one post -operative time 
point. Ideally, the study team also hopes to understand the time course of recovery after surgery; 
therefore, we aim to evaluate patients at each time point. The research -only voice and swallow 
evaluations do not affect clinical care for thyroid cancer patients.  
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page [ADDRESS_827222] patients, making the Week 6 time 
point ideal for collection. In multivariate analysis, the postoperative thyroglobulin level is often found to 
be an independ ent predictor of persistent or recurrent dis ease with a level above 0.2 ng/m L considered 
“elevated”. Based on this result as well as the pathology report , the subject’s treating endocrinologist 
will determine his or her risk status. According to the 2015 A merican Thyroid Association Management 
Guidelines for Adult Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer, RAI remnant 
ablation is not routinely recommended after thyroidectomy in low -risk patients, although consideration 
of specific feat ures of the individual patient that could modulate recurrence risk, disease follow -up 
implications, and patient preference are relevant to decision making regarding RAI. We will not require 
low-risk patients to undergo RAI remnant ablation in accordance wi th these guidelines; instead, their 
low risk status and thyroglobulin level < 0.2 ng/mL will classify their response to therapy as excellent. 
Should low -risk patients choose to undergo RAI remnant ablation, they will follow the protocol outlined 
below.  
 
In all intermediate - and high -risk subjects and low -risk subjects who choose to undergo RAI remnant 
ablation therapy, r adioactive iodine will be administered at [ADDRESS_827223] -operatively and will be 
administered with  rTSH. For consistency  all subjects  will be treated with 50 mCi of radioactive iodine  
unless it is strongly recommended otherwise based on specific features of the individual patient . 
Microscopic nodal involvement found on pathologic review will not influence the treatment dose of 
radioactive  iodine, but the presence or absence of micrometastatic versus macrometastatic disease will 
be tracked for  future analyses.  Thyroglobulin levels will be checked after the rTSH stimulation in order to 
assess the burden of disease prior to radioactive iodine t reatment.  Following radioactive iodine 
administration, levothyroxine will be administered to maintain TSH < 0.5 uIU/mL.  Labs will be checked at 
6-[ADDRESS_827224] underwent RAI remnant ablation,  recombinant TSH will be administered and a blood 
sample testing for the stimulated thyroglobulin level will be obtained  at the 1 Year visit.  If the stimulated 
thyroglobulin is gr eater than 2  ng/mL and the neck ultrasound is negative,  a whole body scan will be 
obtained. El evated thyroglobulin and/or positive whole  body scanning will prompt  further evaluation 
with ultrasound, CT, MRI, or CT -PET as needed. All participants  will be followed for a minimum of 1 year 
after treatment. Long term follow- up tracking the incidence of  disease recurrence will be conducted 
throughout the entirety of th e study , with the goal of track ing patients beyond the active study phase 
through our prospective endocrine surgical database . 
 
Long- term follow -up: Participants who receive a diagnosis of PTC, as confirmed by [CONTACT_621404], and continue to receive care within the University of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621377] t review and the endocrine surgery outcomes database until their cancers recur or 
they are lost to f ollow up.  Clinical documentation of cancer recurrence  only , if it occurs, will be 
abstracted from their electronic medical records.  
 
At each time point (pre- operatively, post -operative, 6 weeks after surgery, 6 months after surgery, and 1 
year after surgery) , a semi -structured qualitative interview will be conducted by a trained interviewer 
who is not a member of the clinical staff. Interview guides were developed in consultation with clinical 
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page 15 of 34 staff and pi[INVESTIGATOR_621378]; guides include both prompted and  unprompted open -ended questions 
aimed at understanding patient experience with various components of thyroid cancer treatment and 
subsequent care.  All interviews will be transcribed verbatim and any identifiers will be removed from 
transcripts prior to c oding. Data will be coded using a catalogue of focused codes developed through 
analysis of emergent themes in a representative subset of interview transcripts. Qualitative Health 
Research Consultants (QHRC), a NIH approved subcontract consisting of [CONTACT_621423], [CONTACT_621424], and their employees, will assist with data collection and analysis associated with qualitative 
aims.   
 
Patients will also be contact[CONTACT_621405], to better 
understand patient’s perceptions of their participation in a clinical trial, and to give patients to 
opportunity to receive updates on study -related research in the future.  
 
Additi onally, we would like to use the coded transcripts from the interviews to customize N atural 
Language Processing (NLP) tools ; Doing this will provide a usable training dataset from coded quality of 
life (QOL) surveys that the patients completed on the day o f each interview. We will train NLP 
algorithms to turn patient narratives ( transcribed interview text) into quality of life measures.  That is, 
we aim to predict how a person would fill out a given quality of life survey tool based on their interview 
text.   The following describes the development process:  
 
1. The interview recordings will be transcribed by [CONTACT_621406] (WiSOR) or an outside contractor with a business 
associate agreement that has been approved by [CONTACT_621407]/Privacy Officer for HIPAA 
compliance. Transcriptionist s have been instructed to remove identifying information from the 
transcripts.  The audio recordings and transcripts will be shared through a secure server that only the 
transcriptionists and study team members have access to.   
 
2. The completed interview transcripts will be stored on the secure network within the Wisconsin 
Surgical Outcomes Research Program (WiSOR).  The main levels of security for t his data application 
server housed at the SMPH Computer Center include: being securely located behind the UW -Madison 
campus firewall; having data directory access controls; having physical server security; and having virtual 
server security.  The participants’ names and identifying information will be stored separately from the 
interview transcripts.  The only link between the transcripts and the identifying information will be a 
subject identification number contained in both data files.  
 
3. The transcript s will be reviewed and patient narratives pertinent to quality of life will be extracted.  
 
4. Natural language processing (NLP) tools will be used to parse the patient narratives and extract 
quality of life measures.  A variety of parsing and machine learning strategies will be employed to 
maximize accuracy. Collaborators in the Department of Jo urnalism and Mass Communications will assist 
with the development of these tools. All  resulting data files will be stored on  secure and encrypted 
server s. 
 
5. The accuracy of the NLP tools will be evaluated by [CONTACT_621408]  
 
6. The NLP tools will be customized as needed to make extraction as accurate as possible.  Again, a 
variety of software packages and/or machine learning programming will be employed.  
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page [ADDRESS_827225] meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study.  
1. Pre-operative diagnosis or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_621379], usually by [CONTACT_396835]  
2. No pre -operative evidence of cervical lymph nod e metastases  on neck ultrasound  
(Randomization arm s ONLY)  
3. No evidence of distant metastases  
4. Age [ADDRESS_827226] p api[INVESTIGATOR_243703] <1 cm in size  on ultrasound  
2. Previous thyroid surgery  
3. Concurrent active malignancy of another type  
4. Age <21 or >[ADDRESS_827227] paralysis  
8. Chronic neurologic condition which affects voice or swallow ( for instance, multiple sclerosis or 
Parkinson  disease ) 
9. Baseline laryngeal pathology that would warrant intervention that could affect voice or swallow 
function  
10. Becomes pregnant before surgery or at any time while on study  
 
4.3. Intra -operation exclusion criteria (Randomization arm s ONLY ) 
1. Evidence of nodal involvement identified in the OR  
2. Failure to confirm diagnosis of cancer in participant   
 
4.4. Protected populations  
We will not be including any vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners,  those without decision 
making capacity  or women known to be pregnant in  this study.  
 
5. Trial interventions  
The intervention portion of this study is the assignment to  Treatment A rm 1 (no CND) or Treatment Arm 
2 (CND).   SOC arm patients  will not undergo any specific treatment intervention.  
 
5.1. Treatment Arm 1  (No CND)  
Arm  1: total  thyroidectomy alone . 
 
5.2. Treatment Arm 2  (CND)  
Arm 2: total thyroidectomy with ipsilateral prophylactic CND  
 
5.3. Treatment Arm 3  ( SOC)  
Arm 3: n o specific trial intervention, treated as per patient and physician preference  
 
5.4. Allocation to intervention  
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page 17 of 34 Patient allocation will be randomized by [CONTACT_2329] a permuted block randomization stratified by [CONTACT_654] (≥ or <  
age 45) as the staging of thyroid cancer is different based on patient age, and tumor size (T1 -T2 vs. T3) 
as the  benefit of prophylactic central neck dissection may be greater in patients with T3 tumors. We 
have no  predefined recruitment goal for participants ≥ or < age 45. For tumor size we would like to 
recruit 25% of patients with T3 tumors (size > 4 cm or minimal extrathyroidal extension) ; this is  
estimated to be 25% of our eligible population,  so we believe that this goal is achievable. Randomization 
will occur o n the day of surgery in the operating room  after confirming no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_621380] y and 
will only be known by [CONTACT_67361]. Participants will be blinded to their treatment allocati on 
until their [ADDRESS_827228] well established referral  patterns from  Winnebago County, IL, which has a 
significantly higher proportion of underrepresented minority  patients than Dane County where our 
institution is based.  
 
We will work closely with referring endocrinologists to perform the needed long -term follow up for th e 
participants in the study. We will try to condense all study visits to 4 time points, which are already 
established  for routine clinical follow up. Because participation in the study will require additional time 
at these appointments we will provide a sm all monetary reimbursement for participation in each of the 
study visits ($2 0). The cost of all study procedures that are not the standard of care will be covered as 
part of participation in the clinical trial.  
 
6.2. Screening  
A member of the study staff will assess patient eligibility using the Prepatory to Research provision, as 
approved by [CONTACT_21980] (IRB). All protected health information used during the 
screening process of a potential participant  will b e the minimum necessary for the conduct of this study. 
Any protected information recorded will be destroyed at the end of the screening process. The clini cal 
care team of the potential participant  will be aware of the potential participation in this study as they 
will be the ones who refer the participant .  
 
After consent is obtained, if any pre -operative procedures were not captured in the medical record, 
these will be conducted as necessary per standard of care prior to surgery. The study team will record  
the necessary data from these standard of care procedures.  
 
A participant is enrolled prior to surgery and will undergo baseline testing of voice and swallow5 function 
and QOL assessment.  They will be randomized during surgery  after confirmation that the re is no 
evidence of nodal involvement . 
 
6.3. Recruitment  and consent  
The human subjects  participating in this study will be recruited from the University  of Wisconsin 
Endocrine Surgery and Otolaryngology Clinics as well as patients referred to the clinic by [CONTACT_621409] . A participant’s decision  whether or not to participate will not affect the care he or she 
receives as a patient. Participants will be treated  according to the standard of care for their disease until 
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page [ADDRESS_827229] . 
 
7. Activities and measurements  
Enrollment:  Participants will be enrolled after signing the informed consent  form .   
 
Pre-operative visit:  The pre-operative visit will include a study -required baseline assessment of every  
participant’s voice and swallow5 function and a QOL  survey .  A baseline assessment of vocal function will 
be considered clinically indicated  in those patients with existing voice complaints or prior neck surgery.  
If patients are found to have some abnormality on their vocal evaluation that  would warrant 
intervention, they will not proceed to randomization. These pre-operative study evaluation s will be 
coordinated with the standard collection of the participant ’s pre -operative medical history , physical  
exam,  and laboratory evaluation.  
 
Day of surgery :  Once the surgeon  visually confirm s there is no evidence of nodal involvement 
intraoperatively, the  participant  will be randomized.   Study arm randomization will be computer 
generated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Glen Leverson  of the UW Department of Surgery Biostatistics Office and 
communicated to the surgeon v ia sealed envelope.  Participants will be blinded to their treatment arm 
until the Day [ADDRESS_827230] -operative care in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]:  After surgery , participants  will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621381] s will be  performed per standard of care.  
   
Post-operative Day 1: The participant  will be educated  on the signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia and 
be given detailed instruction on how to treat these symptoms  per standard of care .  They will be given a 
study log to fill out which will allow them to record the frequency and severity of symptoms and the 
number of doses of calcium taken.  This will be completed  and returned to study staff at the Day 12  visit.  
 
Day 12 visit:  Physical and laboratory  evaluations  will be performed per standard of care.  A  
comprehensive  voice and swallow5 evaluation  will be conducted; this will be considered a research 
procedure unless the p articipant  is experiencing difficulty swallowing or there is evidence of vocal fold  
dysfuncti on.  The p articipant  will also complete a QOL survey  and participate in a qualitative interview  
per study protocol .  
 
Week 6 visit: [ADDRESS_827231] -operative thyroglobulin levels and assess response to treatment. During the visit, 
participants will complete QoL surveys and participate in a qualitative interview. If the patient’s voice or 
swallow function was impaired at the Day [ADDRESS_827232]’s risk profile based on the criteria 
outlined in section [ADDRESS_827233] schedule:

 Day 3:  50 mCu  I-131 therapy a dministered2 
 Day 5: Stimulated thyroglobulin lab  
 Day 5- 17: Whole Body Scan performed  
 
Month  6 visit: Physical and laboratory  evaluations, as well as  an ultrasound of the neck , will be 
performed per standard of care.  PTH and calcium samples required for the study will be drawn  at this 
time .  A QOL survey and qualitative interview will be completed.  If the patients’ voice or swallow 
function was impaired at the W eek 6 visit, additional voice and swallow5 evaluations  will also be 
performed . 
 
1 Year visit: Patients will receive  a neck ultrasound  and labs per standard of care.  If a patient underwent 
RAI remnant ablation, a stimulated thyroglobulin level after rTSH administration will be obtained to 
assess response to th erapy.  A QOL survey and qualitative interview will be completed.  If the patients’ 
voice or swallow5 function was impaired at the Month 6  visit, additional voice and swallow evaluations  
will also be performed . 
 
Follow -up: Patients will receive a quality improvement follow -up survey between [ADDRESS_827234] study activity.  Patients who meet criteria for long term follow -up will 
continue to be followed through chart review and the endocrine surgery outcomes database.  
 
Time required for study procedures : 120 minutes for voice and swallow evaluation3, 5

7.2. Blood sample collection  
For patients enrolled in the randomization arm, b lood drawn for research purposes will be collected at  
the patient’s standard of care blood draws  whenever possible,  which should result in only one  additional 
venipuncture be ing necessary  (at the Week  6 visit) .  Lab results from the research samples will be 
entered into the patient’s chart and reported to th e patient.   About 15 mL (one tablespoon) of 
additional blood will be taken ; no research samples will be saved or banked for future testing.  No 
additional blood for research purposes only will be drawn from patients enrolled in the standard of care 
arm.  
 
7.3. Data entry  
Data will be collected electronically and on paper. The following will be captured electronically: (1) data 
from the electronic medical record (see data collection sheet); (2) voice and swallow evaluation video 
and audio recordings and clinician reports/summaries; (3) audio  recordings of participant interviews and 
electronic codes for content themes. Paper data collection will consist of the QOL instruments (SF12, 
EAT-10, EORTC, ThyCa -QOL, and VHI).  Raw data will be scored or otherwise evaluated as necessary and 
entered into a study -specific Microsoft Access database as soon as possible after data collection.  
 
Voice and videostroboscopy recordings collected during this study  may not be immediately destroyed 
after all research procedures have been completed, as this data could be of value to a follow up or 
related study.  IRB approval will be sought for any use of this data outside of the study parameters 
described  in this protocol.  
 
7.4. Participant  withdrawals  
Participants have the right to withdraw fro m the study at any time for any reason, either before or after 
the surgical procedure.  Additionally, any participant may be discontinued from the study at any time at 
the discretion of the investigator  if she feels it is in the best interest of the partic ipant .  If a participant  
withdraws or is withdrawn from one aim (i.e. voice and swallow) , they may continue to participate in 
the other aims.   
 
Study participation may be terminated early under the following circumstances:  
                                                 
 
 If voice and swallow are normal at any post -op visit, then evaluations will not be performed at subsequent follow up time 
points.

8. Data analysis and statistical considerations  
 
8.1. Sample size determination  
At the beginning of this study, w e anticipate d random izing 140 patients with clinically node negative 
thyroid cancer, w ith the goal of 116 participants completing the study. Patients will be recruited from 
the Endocrine Surgery and  Otolaryngology Clinics at the University of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84059]. 
This is a high volume tertiary care  center with a large thyroid practice, performing approximately 350 
thyroid operations per year. Thyroid cancer  accounts for 30% of thyroidectomy cases at our institution 
and this is the pool from which the patients will be  identified (approximately 105 patients/year). 
Approximately 15% of thyroid cancer cases will have a positive  pre-operative ultrasound, thus 
decreasing our pool of eligible participants to approximately 89 patients per year. With an accrual goal 
of 140 p articipants within 4 years, we would  need to recruit 39% of eligible patients  each year.  
 
Permanent  complications in thyroid surgery are uncommon, but these complications can be disastrous 
for a patient that is  affected. Permanent hypoparathyroidism occurs  in 1-2% of patients after a total 
thyroidectomy and the risk  may be as high as 14% whe n a CND is performed.  The best surrogate marker 
to predict an  increase in permanent morbidity is the incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism, which is 
substantially mo re common than permanent hypoparathyroidism. For example, transient 
hypoparathyroidism occurred in 12% of our last 270 patients under going a total thyroidectomy.  The rate 
of transient hypoparathyroidism in patients  treated with a CND has been shown in the literature to be 
significantly higher. The rate of transient  hypoparathyroidism in recent large retrospective studies was 
reported to be between 38 -51%.  
 
We assumed a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. For sample size calculations we made  the assumption 
that the incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism after a total thyroidectomy alone is 12% and  that an 
increase to 36% (or tripling of the risk) is clin ically significant. The rate of hypoparathyroidism in Arm [ADDRESS_827239] 270 patients and is a reliable estimate. The incidence in the CND arm  is based on a  
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page 23 of 34 review of the literature and we purposely chose a number on the lower end of quoted ranges to ensure 
that we are not underestimating our sample size. With these assumptions the sample size is 11 6, with 
58 patients per  arm. Due to the short follow up for our primary endpoint (post -operative day 1) and for 
our secondary  endpoints (<12 months), we anticipate no significant loss to follow up. For our secondary 
aims, we chose the Dysphonia Severity In dex (DSI) as representative and found a prior thyroid surgery 
study (45) showing that as  few as [ADDRESS_827240] -op. Thus, the sample size in  our study should be adequate to address our secondary aims 
even if there is attrition/ loss to follow- up. 
 
The number of patients who must be consented will be larger than the final sample size because a  
portion of patients that are enrolled and evaluated pre -operatively may not be randomized the day of 
surgery  (because malignancy is not proven intraoperatively, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_621384], or there 
is gross local  invasion). We aim  to increase the  sample size by 20% to accommodate for this.  
 
We have found in our examination of preliminary  data that our objective measures are not effectively 
capturing the impact of surgery on patients and that the most critical and meaningful data that we are 
obtai ning from our study is from the in -depth patient interviews. Given the value of our qualitative data, 
we need to ensure that we are capturing adequate qualitative data to identify differences between the 
objective and patient -reported evaluations of experiences with hypocalcemia and voice and swallowing 
problems caused by [CONTACT_621410]. Ultimately, we plan to make our existing study 
aims even more robust by [CONTACT_621411].  
 
Based on our experience with qualitative research and the rates of objective complications in the 
patients enrolled to date, we’ve  determined  that we need to enroll at least [ADDRESS_827241] analysis of variance examining 
the effects of treatment group, time and factor interactions, such as radioactive iodine dose. Evaluation 
time  periods (pre -surgery, Day 12, Week 6, Month  6, and 1 Year ) will serve  as between subjects factor 
and treatment  group (prophylactic CND versus no CND) will serve as the between subjects factor. 
Experiment- wise error will be controlled with an  appropriate adjustment to the alpha -level. Prior to 
each analysis, we will plot all data and  carefully examine each analysis to ascertain that the assumptions 
of ANOVA are not violated. Data will be  transformed as necessary to better conform to the assumptions. 
Nonparametric statistics will be used when  assumptions for ANOVA are not achieved. Statistical support 
for the study design and analysis will be  performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Glen Leverson who will perform analyses with 
SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc.,  Cary, NC).  
 
9. Risks and benefits of trial participation  
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page [ADDRESS_827242] of  
care in the treatment of thyroid cancer and there is no added risk to participating in this study for the  
participants. These tests include: lab testing, pre -operative and post -operati ve ultrasound, thyroid 
hormone  replacement at suppressive doses, and radioactive iodine ablation.   
 
Risks associated with videofluoroscopic (VF) swallow study5  
There are some small risks associated with the videofluoroscopic (VF) swallow study and the complete  
voice evaluations. However, these evaluations are considered routine evaluation method for patients 
with voice  and swallowing disorders and thus can be considered minimal risk. That is, the probability 
and magnitude of  harm or discomfort anticipated with these evaluations are not greater in and of 
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical 
or psychological examinations  or tests (45 CFR 46.102).  
 
With VF there are small levels of radiation exposure. The UW -IRB has previously determined that prior  
research from our department involving VF is minimal risk. Participants will likely be exposed to 
radiation from  the fluoroscopy unit f or approximately [ADDRESS_827243] videofluoroscopic evaluation yields an average effective dose to the patie nt 
of 0.85 mSv, which is  considered a lo w associated risk (1/16,000).  Parti cipation in this study does not 
prevent the participant from  undergoing any medical procedure that would require further exposure to 
X-ray. Bolus volumes to be used are  considered s afe even i n severely dysphagic patients  and all 
participants will be carefully observed in the  controlled radiology environment  
 
Potential risks of the VF swallow study include gagging, choking, and fainting. There is minimal  
discomfort and minimal risk as sociated with the endoscopy procedures u sed during the evaluations. The 
rigid  endoscope is simply inserted into the mouth, without the need fo r any topi[INVESTIGATOR_41459]. It is 
possible that the participant may feel a slight amount of anxiety due to having so mething placed into 
his/her mouth, although in  our experience this is very rare. There may b e discomfort with the face mask 
or feelings of unease or anxiety  during the airflow recordings due to the facemask or the tube in the 
participant’s mouth. The likelihood of these  risks occurring is small and further reduced by [CONTACT_621412].  Medical staff will be immediately on hand in our 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621385].  
 
Risks associated with psychologi cal stress  
Participants will be discussing their experiences and any adverse outcomes they have experienced in the 
post -operative period .  This may cause changes in thought processes and emotion.  These changes will 
mostly be transitory;  however they may be recurrent, or even permanent .   
 
Risks associated with loss of confidentiality  
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page [ADDRESS_827244] of care procedures would treat a study -
eligible patient with higher doses of radioactive iodine (usually 100 mCi) than is allowed under this 
protocol.  This th eoretical under  treat ment  could possibly contribute to a recurrence or persistence of 
the original disease, requiring  either additional surgery or radioactive iodine  treatment(s)  in the future . 
If there are concerns about the dosing of radioactive iodine t he case will be presented at our 
multidisciplinary tumor board and a joint decision made by [CONTACT_621413].  
 
Unknown risks  
This study  may involve risks to the participant  which are currently unforeseeable . We will inform 
participant s as soon as possible if we discover any  information that may affect the participant 's health, 
welfare, or decision to be in this study . 
 
9.2. Mitigation of p otential risks 
Mitigation of r isks associated with surgical procedures  
The risks associated with the surgical procedures are clinical risks not specific to the research because 
participants are receiving surgery due to clinical necessity and both types of surgery are considered 
standard of care. These risks are described in detail to the patient as part of the informed consent 
process for surgery and the risks are the same for bo th proposed procedures, although the magnitude of 
the risk may be different. While inclusion of a prophylactic CND may increase the risks of surgery it also 
may provide a clinical benefit to the patient by [CONTACT_621414]. This is one of the issues 
to be examined in the proposed research.  
 
Mitigation of r isks associated with lab testing 
The risks of these tests are clinical risks and not research risks . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_621386].  
 
Mitigation of r isks associated with videofluoroscopic (VF) swallow study5  
The likelihood of these risks occurring is small and further reduced by [CONTACT_621415]. Medical staff will be immediately on hand in our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621387].  
 
Mitigation of r isks associated with psychological stress  
The participant showing signs of psychological stress will be reminded of the voluntary nature of the 
clinical trial they are participating in, and that they ca n stop at any time  without punishment or loss of 
care .  The Primary Investigator will be made  aware of any participants displaying these signs by [CONTACT_75275], and will refer them to appropriate resources as needed.  
 
Mitigation of r isks associated with loss of con fidentiality  
All information  obtained and associated data files will be confidential and will be kept in a locked file or 
password protected  computer. The risk of breach of confidentiality regarding participation in the study 
outside of the scope of the  research will be handled by [CONTACT_621416].  
 
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page 26 of 34 Confidentiality will be protected further by: (1) using a participant log form that contains only the 
minimum  necessary protected health information (PHI) concerning participants, and storing this log in a 
locked area  when not in use, (2) not sharing PHI with any outside institution, (3) coding data collection 
forms w ith a  consecutive participant number that is not derived from any participant personal 
identifiers, and linking that  data collection form to the participant log, and (4) storing the participant log 
and data collection forms  separately.  
 
 It is highly likely that these measures will result in avoidance of breach of confidentiality outside of  the 
research. In addition, the data to be collected are not sensitive to participants. A data and safety 
monitoring board will also be in place.  
 
Mitigation of r isks of radioactive iodine standardization  
It is not clinically possible to know if a recurrence was due either completely (or in part ) to the slightly 
lower dose of radioactive iodine .  All participants will be followed rigorously according to current 
guidelines, and if recurrence  or persistence occurs, detecti on of the disease at an early stage will 
facilitate appropriate treatment.  
 
9.3. Potential benefits  and risk -to-benefit ratio  
Potential benefits to the individual participant  
Individual benefits to participants are not guaranteed, as this study is seeking to determine which of the 
two accepted standard of care treatments participant s could receive will yield the best clinical benefits.  
We do not anticipate any direct benefits to participants as a result of the evaluation of natural language 
processing of patient interview narratives.  
 
Potential benefit to s ociety  
Over 60,[ADDRESS_827245] could be used to more easily extrac t quality of life information from 
health -related social media sites and electronic health resources. This could lead to more patient -
centered care. It could also reduce the need to administer structured quality of life surveys, which can 
be time- consuming and may miss important quality of life indicators that may come out in an 
unstructured patient narrative.  
 
Risk-to-benefit ratio 
Although individual benefits to participants are not guaranteed, it is anticipated that considerable  
societal benefit will res ult from the proposed studies. Currently both surgical approaches proposed are  
accepted standards of care. While the risks associated with a CND may be higher, that risk is offset by a 
potential clinical benefit to the patient. The reason this study is ess ential is that currently the evidence 
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page 27 of 34 cannot  support one treatment over another and therefore we feel that this study has true equipoise. 
The results of this  study can be used to help guide the treatment of thyroid cancer and  help provide 
solid evidence to  support  future guidelines.  
 
10. Adverse events  and unanticipated problems  
 
10.1. Adverse event definitions  
Adverse event (AE)  
An adverse event is defined as a ny untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human participant  
including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the participant 's 
participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the participant 's participation in the 
research.  Adverse event collection will begin at Day o f Operation and continue through the last 
assessments. Untoward medical occurrences or acute conditions that occur between screening and 
surgery will be recorded as medical history.  
 
Serious adverse event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event  is defined as any adverse event that meets one of the following criteria:  
• Results  in death; OR  
• Is life -threatening; OR  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] p rolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; OR  
• Resul ts in significant or persistent disability  or incapacity ; OR 
• Results in  a congenital  anomaly/birth defect ; OR   
 
Unanticipated problem (UP)  
An unanticipated problem is defined as an event that meets all of the following criteria:  
(1) u nexpected in severity, nature, or frequency given the research procedures and the 
characteris tics of the participant  population  (i.e., problems that are not described in this 
protocol or other study documents) ; AND  
(2) related or possible related to participation in the research ; AND  
(3) s uggests  that research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm related to the 
research than was previously known or recognized.  
 
10.2. Severity assessment  
The severity of all adverse events will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild = does not interfere with the participant ’s usual fu nction  
• Moderate  = interferes to some extent with the participant ’s usual function  
• Severe = interferes significantly with the participant ’s usual function  
 
10.3. Causality assessment  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_621388]:  
• Definite  = AE is clearly related to the study procedures  
• Probable  = AE is likely related to the study procedures  
• Possible  = AE is possibly related to the study procedures  
• Unlikely  = AE is doubtfully related to the st udy procedures  
• Unrelated  = AE is clearly not related to the study procedures  
 
10.4. Procedures for recording and reporting adverse events  
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page [ADDRESS_827246] 
treatment.  Since the adverse events being track ed are associated with both treatment arms, it will be 
difficult to know if the adverse event is  truly related to the intervention of not. The frequency of events 
will be monitored bi-annually by [CONTACT_9288] C.  Ongoing study -relate d risks to patient s include: the 
qualitative interviews ; QOL surveys;  and the voice and swallow5 assessment (s).  It is anticipated that 
there will be very few adverse events attributable to this follow up care.  
 
Adverse events  recording will cease after patients’ final study visits at [ADDRESS_827247] treatment , i.e. these 
events  will not be  tracked during long term recurrence follow up.  
 
 
11. Trial safety monitoring   
 
11.1. Data Safety Monitoring Committee  
Oversight and Monitoring Plan  
The UWCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for the regular review and 
monitoring of all ongoing clinical research in the UWCCC.  A summary of DSMC activities are as follows:  
• Reviews all clinical trials conducted at the UWCCC for subje ct safety, protocol  compliance, 
and data integrity  
• Reviews all Serious Adverse Events (SAE) requiring expedited reporting, as defined in the 
protocol, for all clinical trials conducted at the UWCCC, and studies conducted at external 
sites for which UWCCC acts as an oversight body  
• Reviews all reports generated through the UWCCC DSMS elements (Internal Audits, Quality 
Assurance Reviews, Response Reviews, Compliance Reviews, and Protocol Summary 
Reports) described  in Section II of this document  
• Notifies the pr otocol Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_164360], if applicable, any 
requirements for corrective action r elated to data or safety issues  
• Notifies the CRC of DSMC decisions and any correspondence from the DSMC to the protocol 
Principal Investigator  
• Works  in conjunction with the UW Health Sciences IRB in the review of relevant safety 
information as well as protocol deviations, non -compliance, and unanticipated problems 
report ed by [CONTACT_15266]  
• Ensures that notification is of SAEs requiring expe dited reporting is provided to external 
sites participating in multi- institutional clinical trials coordinated by [CONTACT_621417].  All protocols (including Intervention Trials, Non -
Intervention Trials, Behavioral and Nutritional Studies, and trials conducted under a Training Grant) are 
evaluated by [CONTACT_621418].  UWCC monitoring requirements for trials 
without an acceptable external DSMB are as follows:  
 
Intermediate Monitoring  
Protocols subject to intermediate monitoring generally include UW Institutional Phase I/II and Phase II 
Trials. These protocols under go review of subject safety at regularly scheduled DOWG meetings where 
the results of each subject’s treatment are discussed and the discussion is documented in the DOWG 
                                                 
 
5 Swallow evaluations were discontinued for patients enrolled after 12/01/2016  
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page 29 of 34 meeting minutes. The discussion includes the number of subjects enrolled, significant toxicities, dose 
adjustments, and responses observed. Protocol Summary Reports are submitted on a semi -annual basis 
by [CONTACT_15270].  
 
11.2. Review and oversight requirements  
Serious Adverse Event –  reported within 24 h ours  
Serious Adverse Events requiring reporting within 24 hours (as described in the protocol) must also be 
reported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) Chair via an email to 
[EMAIL_259] within one business day.  The OnCore SAE Details R eport must be 
submitted along with other report materials as appropriate (NCI AdEERS form or FDA Medwatch Form 
#3500 and/or any other documentation available at that time of initial reporting). The DSMC Chair will 
review the information and determine if im mediate action is required. Within [ADDRESS_827248] be submitted electronically along with a 24 hour follow -
up SAE Details Report and a completed UWCCC SAE Routing Form to [EMAIL_259]. 
All in formation is entered and tracked in the UWCCC database.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_357335], the IRB, and 
the funding agency and provides documentation of these notifications to the DSMC.  
 
If the SAE occurs on a clinical trial in which the UW PI [INVESTIGATOR_15152]- investigator, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_621389].   
 
See Section 11.3  for detailed instructions on SA E reporting.  
 
Serious Adverse Event –  Reported within 10 Days  
Serious Adverse Events requiring reporting within 10 days (as described in the protocol) must also be 
reported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) Chair via an email to 
saenotify@ uwcarbone.wisc.edu.  The OnCore SAE Details Report must be submitted along with other 
report materials as appropriate (NCI AdEERS form or FDA Medwatch Form #3500 and/or any other 
documentation available at that time of initial reporting). The DSMC Chair will review the information 
and determine if further action is required. All information is entered and tracked in the UWCCC 
database.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_357335], the IRB, the 
sponsor, and the funding agency and provides documentation of these notifications to the DSMC.  
If the SAE occurs on a clinical trial in which the UW PI [INVESTIGATOR_15152]- investigator, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_621390] a nd other participating 
investigators.   
 
See Section 11.3  for detailed instructions on SAE reporting.  
 
Study Progress Review  
Protocol Summary Reports (PSR) are required to be submitted to the DSMC in the timeframe 
determined by [CONTACT_15273] (quarterly; semi- annually; or annually). The PSR provides a 
cumulative report of SAEs, as well as instances of non -compliance, protocol deviations, and 
unanticipated problems, toxicities and responses that have occurred on the protocol in the timeframe 
specified.  PSRs for those protocols scheduled for review are reviewed at each DSMC meeting.  
 
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page 30 of 34 Protocol Summary Reports enable DSMC committee members to assess whether significant benefits or 
risks are occurring that would warrant study suspension or closure. This information is evaluated by [CONTACT_621419] (e.g., reports from Internal Audits, 
Quality Assurance Reviews, etc.) occurring since the prior review of the protocol by [CONTACT_6802].  
Additionally, t he DSMC requires the study team to submit external DSMB or DSMC reports, external 
monitoring findings for industry -sponsored studies, and any other pertinent study -related information.  
 
In the event that there is significant risk warranting study suspensi on or closure, the DSMC will notify 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_15160] (e.g., suspension 
or closure).  The DSMC ensures that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_15161] a clinical 
trial to th e sponsor (e.g., NCI Program Director, Industry Sponsor Medical Monitor, Cooperative Group 
Study Chair, etc.) and other appropriate agencies. DSMC findings and requirements for follow -up action 
are submitted to the CRC.  
 
11.3. Expedited reporting of Serious Adve rse Events  
Depending on the nature, severity, and attribution of the serious adverse event an SAE report will be 
phoned in, submitted in writing, or both according to Table [#] below. All serious adverse events must 
also be reported to the UWCCC Data and S afety Monitoring Committee Chair.  All serious adverse events 
must also be reported to the UW IRB (if applicable), and any sponsor/funding agency not already 
included in the list.  
 
Determine the reporting time line for the SAE in question by [CONTACT_621420].  Then refer to the 
subsequent sections if the SAE occurred at the UWCCC.  
 
FDA reporting requirements for Serious Adverse Events (21 CRF Part 312)6, 7 
NOTE: Investigators MUST immediately report to the UWCCC and any other parties outlined in the 
protocol ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they are considered related to the investigational 
agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64).  
 
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:

calendar days of learning of the AE  
 
SAE requiring [24] h our reporting occurs at UWCCC:  
Report to the UWCCC:  
Reference the SAE SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) and the SAE Reporting Workflow for DOWGs on 
the UWCCC website (http://www.uwccc.wisc.edu) for specific instructions on how and what to report to 
the UWCCC for [24] hour initial and follow -up reports.  A follow -up report is required to be submitted 
within 10 days of the initial [24] hour report.   
 
For this protocol, the following UWCCC entities are required to be notified:  
(1) DSMC ( [EMAIL_259] ) 
(2) UWCCC Study PI  
(3) UWCCC Treating MD  
(4) Any other appropriate parties listed on the SAE Routing Form (for follow -up reports only)  
 
Report to the IRB:  
The timing and format for submitting an AE report to the IRBs depends on whether: (a) the event 
suggests an adverse alteration in the risks to s ubjects or others; (b) the event is reasonably related to 
study participation; (c) the event is unexpected; (d) there is a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or 
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC); (e) the event occurred at sites or to subjects under UW purvi ew; (f)

• Immediately life threatening or severely debilitating to other current subjects, and  
• Caused by [CONTACT_621421]. AEs that meet these conditions must be reported to the 
IRB Chair or IRB Director via telephone as soon as possible, but no later than 1 bu siness day after the 
local research team becomes aware of the event. The research team will then discuss with the IRB Chair 
or IRB Director what action needs to be taken related to the occurrence (e.g., suspension of study 
enrollment, change in treatment r egimen) to prevent further harm from occurring. This initial report to 
the IRB Chair or IRB Director must be followed within 2 business days with a submission of an Adverse

Other Reporting Requirements  
Reporting to the FDA  
Central Neck Dissection  | Protocol  (version date:  22-Feb-2018 ) page [ADDRESS_827251] be 
reported to the FDA within the appropriate time frame.  Mandatory and voluntary reporting guidelines 
and instructions are outlined on the FDA website: 
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/def ault.htm  
 
12. Administrative requirements  
 
12.1. Good clinical practice  
The study will be c onducted in accordance with FDA and ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.   All 
study staff will be thoroughly familiar with the contents of this protocol and associated trial materials.  
 
12.2. Data quality assurance  
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to  
record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant . Study data will 
be entered into an electronic case report form ( eCRF) by [CONTACT_8786]. Any changes made to study 
data will be  made to the CRF .  
 
12.3. Study monitoring  
Due to financial and staff limitations there are no formal plans to monitor data for this study; however 
there remains a possibilit y for this if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_9288] C, HS-IRB, or study team.  
 
12.4. Ethical consideration 
The study will be conducted in acco rdance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The IRB will review all appropriate study documentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety and 
well-being of the participant s. The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB approval has been 
obtained. The protocol, informed consent form, written information given to the patients, safety 
updates, annual progress report s and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB  by 
[CONTACT_093].  
 
12.5. Patient confidential ity 
Information about study participant s will be kept confidential and managed according to the

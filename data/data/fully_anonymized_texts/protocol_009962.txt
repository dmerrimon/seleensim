[ADDRESS_919339] 
Telemedicine allows cli nicians to utilize modern telecommunication technology to provide 
healthcare services to patients including remote symptom monitoring .  Given the spread of 
COVID-19 both locally and globally, is crucial to  adapt accordingly in order to safely provide 
vulne rable cancer patient populations  with optimal care while minimizing risk of exposure to 
COVID-19. In this study , we will utilize remote monitoring  of patients with cancer  via weekly 
patient -reported outcome (PRO) collection through the Way to Health (W2H) smartphone 
application and step data through wearable Fitbit devices.  Patients with incurable lung and 
gastrointestinal cancers will be recruited based on whether they recei ve their care in -clinic or 
remotely. They will respond to weekly phone- based symptom surveys and wear Fitbits that track 
step data. T his data will be collated  in a Palliative Care Assessment Dashboard  (PROStep 
Dashboard) sent to clinicians prior to  each on cology visit to help inform patient managemen t. In 
this feasibility study, two arms of patients will be monitored with symptom surveys and Fitbits; 
the study will randomize these patients to either 1) receive text feedback  or 2) receive no text 
feedback .  A third arm of patients  will be randomized to receive no feedback, symptom surveys, 
or Fitbit device. Clinicians for patients in each arm will receive the PROstep Dashboard. The 
study will determine feasibility of this monitoring approach, and compare patient adherence to symptom surveys and step data collection between the two intervention arms.  
2. Overall objectives  
The objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of remote symptom and activity monitoring 
of patients with incurable lung and gas trointestinal cancers, determine the clinical utility of these 
remote monitoring tools and compare adherence to the intervention based upon the feedback that 
patients receive.   
3. Outcomes 
3.1 Primary outcome 
Patient utility surveys will use a  5-point Likert scale for responses scored 1-5. The two co-
primary outcomes will compare the scores for the following two questions, measured at 6 
months (or 3 months if the patient did not complete their 6 month survey), between 
intervention patients  (Arms B + C) and control patients  (Arm A).  
• How well do you feel your oncology team understands your symptoms (e.g. nausea, 
vomiting, weight loss, etc.)?  
• How well do you feel your oncology team understands your activity level and ability to 
function?  
3.2 Secondary outcomes 
1 
 The following secondary outcome will compare the same questions: 
• Measured at 3 months , between intervention patients  (Arms B + C)  and control 
patients  (Arm A).  
 
We will compare cumulative adherence for patients in the intervention group (arm B and arm C) .  
Each week, adherence will be defined as each week where the patient submits the weekly survey 
(i.e. adherence to PRO) and has step data for 4 of 7 days of the week (i.e. adherence to Fitbit 
platform), divided by [CONTACT_679519] t is enrolled in the trial.  
• Comparison of mean patient adherence at three months for patients in arm B vs arm C  
• Comparison of mean patient adherence at six months for patients in arm B vs arm C  
  We will analyze trends in the PROStep  data (PRO surveys and Fitbit step data).  
• Comparison of PRO scores between patients in arm B vs. arm C.  These will be measured 
using mean and median composite symptom score s as reported by [CONTACT_679520].  T he composite score is the sum of the scores for each domain in the PRO 
survey, and the mean or median composite symptom score is the mean or median of all composite scores collected during the study. 
• Fitbit step data will be measured using mean daily step counts for all days in which Fitb it 
data is collected.  Days where the patient does not have Fitbit data will be excluded from 
these calculations.  
 
3.3 Exploratory outcomes  
• The following exploratory outcomes will make the following comparisons for responses to the two questions in the primary outcomes: 
o Measured at 6 months (or 3 months if the patient did not complete their 6 month 
survey) 
 Between Arm B and Arm A  
 Between Arm C and Arm A  
 Between all Arms.  
o Measured at 3 months: 
 Between Arm B and Arm A  
 Between Arm C and Arm A  
 Between all Arms.  
• Number of palliative care consults  
• Number of documented advanced care planning (ACP) notes 
• Number of documented serious illness conversations (SIC)  
• Correlation between step, heart rate, distance, pace, elevation and sleep data trends, 
patient reported outcomes, patient and clinician ECOG assessment, and patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_679513] 
1 
 • We will report descriptive statistics for the remaining questions on the patient utility 
surveys (mean and standard deviation) followed by t- tests between each individual arm 
and between all intervention patients (Arms B + C) and control patients (Arm A).  Patient 
utility surveys include the following (the intervention arms receiving additional 
questions): 
o How well do you feel that your oncology team has addressed your symptoms? 
o How well do you feel that your oncology team has addressed your activity level 
and ability to function? 
o I feel that the PROStep data prompted better communication with my onco logy team 
about my symptoms.  (arm b and arm c)  
o I feel that the PROStep data prompted better communication with my oncology team about my activity level. (arm b and arm c)  
o My oncology team has discussed the PROStep data during my appointments. 
(arm b and ar m c) 
o I feel that the PROStep data changed how my oncology team addressed my 
symptoms and/or ability to function. (arm b and arm c)  
o I feel that the PROStep  data changed my oncology team’s treatment of my cancer, 
such as decisions to start, continue, or stop cancer treatments like chemotherapy. 
(arm b and arm c)  
o I feel that the PROStep  data triggered discussions with my oncology team about 
my prognosis or goals of my cancer care. (arm b and arm c)  
o I feel that regularly wearing my Fitbit is burdensome. (arm b and arm c)  
o I feel completing my weekly symptom surveys is burdensome. (arm b an d arm 
c) 
o On a scale of 0 -10, how likely is it that you would recommend PROStep to other 
patients with cancer? (arm b and arm c)  
• The utility to clinicians will be measured using survey data at three  and six  months.  
These similarly use a 5 -point Likert scale (1-5) and we will report descriptive statistic s 
for this survey data.  Clinician survey questions include:  
o To what extent was the information provided in the PROstep Dashboard helpful 
for you to better understand: 
• your patient’s symptoms? 
• your patient’s functional status?  
o To what extent did the PROstep dashboard change your management of the 
patient? 
o To what extent did the PROstep dashboard prompt you to have goals of care conversations with this patient?  
o To what extent did the PROstep dashboard have any adverse effect on the patient? 
o Please indicate any ways that the PROstep dashboard has been useful or harmful 
in the management this patient (open ended)

 4. Background 
Patients with incurable  lung and non- colorectal gastrointestinal (GI) cancers benefit from earlier 
palliative care interventions. Early palliativ e care in patients with incurable lung and GI cancers 
has been shown to improve quality of life, reduce a nxiety and depression, decrease  end-of- life 
utilization, and possibly improve survival.1-3 Furthermore, PROs such as shortness of breath, 
weight loss, and appetite loss are independently associated with higher mortality in incurable 
lung and GI cancers.4,5 Limited life expectancy has been recognized as a potential trigger for 
early pal liative care interventions.6,7 Improved identification of patients at risk of short- term 
mortality using patient -generated health data ( PGHD ) may allow better targeting of palliative 
care interventions to improve quality-of- life in incurable lung  and GI cancers.  
Recently available PGHD may improve performance of mortality prediction algorithms, but is 
captured on a low- scale. PGHD are health -related data generated by a patient; they include 
routinely collected information about patient symptoms, functional status, and activity levels out 
of the clinic.8-[ADDRESS_919340] been independently associated with lower overall survival.
5,15 While PROs and activity levels may be 
independently associated with prognosis, collection may be infeasible for large populations of patients. PROs may be collected via paper surveys, automated telephone systems, tablets or downloadable applicati ons.
16,17 Step counts and activity levels are usually passively collected via 
accelerometers (ex. Fitbits). However, there are few examples of large- scale collection of PRO 
or accelerometer data due to low response rates, inadequate resources, and suboptimal clinic ian 
and patient training.[ADDRESS_919341] become urgent.  P atients with active cancer, and 
those with a history of cancer, are at increased risk to develop complications from COVID-19 and are more likely to experience negative outcomes ; thus, it is of high operational importance to 
safely monitor this patient population.
 18-20 The benefits of telehealth during this pandemic 
include limiting the  exposure to other acutely ill patients  and reducing provider burnout. 21-23  As 
a result, CMS has opened up coverage for telehealth services and early data from [LOCATION_001] shows telemedicine v isits increasing  from 369.1 daily to 866.8 daily (135% increase) in urgent 
care after the system -wide expansion of virtual health visits in response to COVID-19, and from 
94.7 daily to 4,209.3 (4345% increase) in non-urgent care post expansion.

5. Study design 
 5.[ADDRESS_919342] of remotely collected PROs and step data 
derived from wearable Fitbit devices, and remotely  presenting those data to clinicians and 
patients at each oncology visit. We will enroll patients who are diagnosed with incurable lung or 
gastrointestinal cancer who are receiving (or planning to receive) chemotherapy. Eligible patients 
can have in-person or virtual visits with their oncology clinician prior to chemotherapy , which is 
of particular importance as many  visits are now being done via telemedicine.  Patients will be 
randomized into one of three arms – a control (arm a), an intervention with no patient feedback 
(arm b), and an intervention with patient feedback (arm c) – at a 1:1:1 allocation  (Figure 1 : 
Patient Arms ). All intervention patients will r eceive 1) weekly PRO surveys for five symptoms 
administered through the W2H  text platform  and 2) a Fitb it wearable device that can track 
patient step, distance, active minutes, sleep, and heart rate data. At each subsequent medical 
oncology visit (either in -person or via telemedicine) , oncology clinicians will receive a PROStep 
Dashboard that reports the patient’s 1) trends in the home- based PROs and step data,  2) acute 
care utilization in the prior six months (Oncology Evaluation Unit, emergency department or 
inpatient admissions), and 3) whether the patient has a documented Serious Illness Conversation 
(a type of Advance Care Planning note that is standard practice at PCAM). Arm C will  receive a 
brief  text message feedback including an active nudge question on their upcoming appointment. 
1 
 Arm B will not receive text feedback .  Arm A will receive no PRO surveys, Fitbit device, or 
patient feedback ( arm a ) (Figure 2: Intervention by [CONTACT_679521] ).  Patients will be enrolled for 
a total of six  months , unless they disenroll earlier,  and evaluated on the outcomes described 
above.

 5.2 Study duration 

1 
 The study is expected to begin in November 2020 and take 12 months to complete. 
 5.3 Target population 
125 patients with incurable lung and gastrointestinal cancer treated at the University of 
Pennsylvania Health System’s Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine (PCAM).   
 5.[ADDRESS_919343] at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine 
(PCAM) . We aim to enroll 125 patients.  We anticipate enrolling these 1 25 patients  over 6 
months at a rate of 4  patients per week, a small fraction of the number of eligible patients with 
in-person or telemedicine visits at PCAM each week.  A summary of recruitment mechanisms is 
found in Section 6 (Subject recruitment).  
 5.[ADDRESS_919344] mee t the following criteria to be eligible for the study:  
1. English-speaking 
2. Have a diagnosis of incurable or Stage IV lung or gastrointestinal cancer   
3. Receive primary oncology care with a thoracic or gastrointestinal medical oncology 
specialist at the Perelma n Center for Advanced Medicine (i.e. does not have a local 
oncologist that provides cancer care, including other UPHS clinic sites) 
4. Currently receiv ing or planned receipt within 2 weeks of IV chemotherapy (see 
exclusions below) 
5. The patient has a smart phone that can receive SMS text messages and has blue-tooth 
capability that can connect to Fitbit. 
5.6 Key exclusion criteria  
Patients will be excluded if any of the following criteria apply: 
1. Age < [ADDRESS_919345] 7 days (patients are not excluded for the use of 
walkers or canes)  
3. Patients who are receiving checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy, IV targeted therapy 
monotherapy (e.g. panitumumab) or oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors  
4. Patients who receive chemotherapy infusions at another UPHS site or outside of UPHS or 
whose primary oncologist is not in thoracic or gastrointestinal oncology groups at PCAM . Notably, patients who receive part of their chemotherapy regimen at home will 
still be allowed to enroll.  
1 
 5. Lung cancer patients enrolled in an ongoing palliative care clinical trial that may lead to 
better communication regarding symptoms and functional status.  
6. Clinician concerns about behavioral health issues that may prevent engagement with text message prompts  
7. Are enrolled in another interventional clinical trial (as clinical trials often have a substantial symptom- reporting structure; non -interventional clinical trials are permitted 
e.g. trials that just involve blood tests) 
6. Subject recruitment  
The recruitment and onboarding process can  be conducted either in -person or remotely 
(depending on restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic).  Upon trial initiation, we will obtain permission from GI and lung oncology clinicians to approach their patients regarding 
this trial. A clinical research coordinator (CRC) will conduct brief chart reviews of patients scheduled to see a GI or lung oncologist at PCAM to identify patients that meet eligibility 
criteria.  The CRC will then  electronically notify clinicians prior to  their scheduled appointments 
with these patients to confirm eligibility and inform them that they will be approaching the 
patient .  When approaching potentially eligible patients, the CRC will wear appropriate 
protective equipment and will meet the patient in the private clinical patient room or the private chemotherapy infusion room to describe the trial and determine eligibility. CRCs may also 
contact [CONTACT_679522]/or email to describe the trial and determine 
eligibility.  The CRC will use a script developed by [CONTACT_679523]-clinic or by [CONTACT_648] (Appendix A) or electronically  based on template language provided by 
[CONTACT_30591] (Appendix B) . After eligibility is confirmed, interested 
participants will be directed to the online Way to Health  (W2H) portal to review and provide 
informed consent, enroll in the study, and complete baseline questionnaires. The CRC will also inform clinicians regarding patient enrollment and ask the clinician to estimate the patient’s 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. The CRC will assist with setting up 
W2H and t heir Fitbit device in -person or by [CONTACT_14223] a virtual meeting (a support partner will be 
encouraged to attend). 
7. Subject compensation 
Patients in arms a, b, and c will be compensated  with a  $[ADDRESS_919346] 
utility survey at 3 months after enrollment and another $[ADDRESS_919347] potential participants to confirm their 
eligibility and explain the study’s objectives, duration and requirements. Individuals who are 
interested in learning more about the study will be directed to the online W2H  portal. Upon 
reaching the portal, potential participants will be led through an automated online informed consent process (Appendix C ).  The consent document will be divided into sections, requiring 
the click of a button to advance from one section to the next. This will help ensure that participants read the consent form thoroughly by [CONTACT_679524]. Successive screens will explain the voluntary nature of the study, the risks and 
benefits of participation, alternatives to participation, and the process for study withdrawal. The 
consent form will clearly state that the weekly electronic symptom surveys and step  data will be 
shared with the patient’s care team via the electronic medical record, whereas all  other 
information collected during the study will remain confidential, available only to the study team 
and with appropriate privacy protections in place.  
 
On the final consent screen, a clearly delineated button will enable patients to agree (or not) to  
participate in the study. Additionally, a platform electronic signature [CONTACT_2329] a finger on a touch 
screen  of a mobile phone will be required. Those who elect not to participate will be asked to 
grant permission (or not) for the study team to collect limite d data from them. An abbreviated 
Study Decline Consent form will be utilized for this purpose, similarly requiring the click of a 
clearly delineated button to agree (or not) to limited data collection, as well as a platform 
electronic signature (Appendix D ).   
 Upon agreeing to participate in the study and clicking the appropriate button, participants will 
have consented to enroll in the study. Participants will then be prompted to complete an online enrollment questionnaire asking for basic demographic information (e.g. age, sex, race, 
education, computer experience- Appendix E). Additional patient characteristics (e.g. Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, Charlson comorbidity score), tumor 
characteristics (e.g. histology), and treatment characteristics (e.g. line/type of therapy) will be 
abstracted from the medical record at the time of enrollment.  The patients will also receive a 
sample survey via text message that mimics the weekly PRO survey they will receive, but the sample survey results will be discarded. The sample will be clearly labeled to indicate that the 
response are not monitored. 
Those who elect not to participate but consent to limited data collection, will be asked to fill out 
a very brief online questionnaire, asking basic demographic information, computer/mobile phone 
experience, and reason(s) for not wanting to participate in a de- identified manner  (Appendix F).  
After enrolling, participants will be provided with details regarding how to contact [CONTACT_679525]- related concerns.  
[ADDRESS_919348] (e.g. in contrast to a therapeutic intervention trial, where receipt of a treatment might 
make the patient ineligible for other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), clinician consent is not needed. The intervention 
simply provides additional information that clinicians can use (or choose not to use) to inform 
routine care of the patient.  
 8.[ADDRESS_919349] m eeting s.  The PIs will go over the study plan including the design, background, and 
outcomes.  The  investigators will obtain verbal consent from  all providers to 1) recruit patients 
into this study and 2) answer a utility survey at [ADDRESS_919350] Fitbit data. The CRC will be responsible for confirming the patient receives their Fitbit device  at their  infusion treatment ( typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the CRC will give this directly to the 
patient in -person, but they can be dropped off beforehand if there are restrictions in place due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic). Patients will be shown how to use thei r Fitbit and link it to their W2H  
account, then being asked to authorize the device to electronically transmit device data to the 
study database. Participants will be instructed to wear the Fit bit device as much as possible, 
including during sleep, for the duration of the study. Participants will be told that they need to sync their wearable device with their smartphone in order for data to be transmitted to the study 
team. Participants will receive regular text message reminders prompting them to wear and sync 
their devices.  
Remote -PROs  
Timing. On Monday of every week, patients will receive a series of text messages to solicit 
patient -reported symptoms.  
Mechanism of delivery.  Text messages will be sent via the W2H  platform. Patients will receive 
the surveys in the form of text messages on their phone. 
Content of the text messages. The text messages will inquire about seven symptoms, requesting a 
response rating the patient’s response. The seven symptoms have been selected by [CONTACT_679526] a list of twelve validated symptoms from the National Cancer 
1 
 Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and will be scored on a five point 
scale from 0 (no present) to 4 (disabling). The patients will also receive a question asking about 
their activity level  over the prior month ( Appendix G).  
Who may respond: During trial enrollment, the patient will be instructed  to answer the text 
messages. However, a caregiver may respond for the patient if the patient needs assistance.  
Safety. PRO data will be shown to clinicians in the PROStep Dashboard (see below) and will not 
be monitored in real time by a clinician. All study participants will be provided with the research coordinator and principle investigator’s email and phone number to contact [CONTACT_679527]-related concerns. Participants will be educated at the outset and reminded throughout the 
study, both verbally and in writing, that the symptom-reporting tool is intended for research 
purposes only. If a participant feels that their symptoms warrant more urgent evaluation, s/he 
will be instructed to call their provider in the usual fashion. The principal i nvestigator will be 
available at all times, should physician escalation be necessary.  
A severe symptom (≥3), or any abrupt change in symptom severity (≥2), will trigger an alert to the participant’s care team  via an EPIC message to the attending clinician’ s symptom pool inbox, 
whose clinicians will be empowered to intervene at their discretion .  Possible interventions might 
include a telephone call, prescription medication, home care visit, same-day office visit, urgent 
care, and/or acute care referral. The CRC will review all text message responses each non -
holiday weekday for other responses that may warrant closer attention by [CONTACT_679528], as appropriate. The CRC can call the 
study investi gators or primary oncology teams at any time to determine whether a text message 
requires further action. 
Until [ADDRESS_919351] been sent (e.g. 10 patients for 3 weeks, or 3 patients for 10 weeks), 
the study investigators and CRC will have a weekly meeting to review the number of responses 
that cross the alert threshold hold, any text message responses and identify any changes to the 
protocol that may be needed to ensure the adequacy of this safety mechanism. After this period, 
the CRC will discuss any concerning text messages to the study investigators.  
Patients may opt out of the text message intervention at any time by [CONTACT_20230] a W2H text 
message with the phrase “Stop”. The CRC will contact [CONTACT_679529]-holiday weekday to determine  whether the patient would like to 1) resume receiving the text messages 
(in which case they will be reactivated), 2) continue in the trial without receiving the text messages, or 3) withdraw from the trial.  
If a patient in the intervention group does not respond to two weekly surveys the CRC will 
contact [CONTACT_679530] (e.g. mobile phone has changed, 
patient does not wish to participate, etc). Patients will be provided with the CRC’s email and 
phone number to contact [INVESTIGATOR_21782].   
[ADDRESS_919352] ( Appendix H ) to lung or GI 
oncology clinicians for each patient enrolled in the intervention arms prior to their appointments . 
W2H  will generate the dashboards and the study team  will physically deliver it to their office or 
touchdown space or send electronically . The Dashboard will include: 
1. Home -based PRO  report, including the weekly survey results for each question in tabular 
and graphical form

rolling weekly averages) and weekly averages in tabular form 
3. A list of all acute care utilization in the UPHS system in the prior 6 months including,

5. Whether the patient has had a documented Serious Illness Conversation  
Active nudge  text feedback  
Intervention patients in arm c will receive text feedback describing worsening or severe 
symptoms collected from their remote PRO questionnaires (i.e. “ Your following symptoms are 
severe or have gotten worse:”) and their step count (“Your Fitbit step count compared to last week is worse. ”).  They will also receive an “active nudge” question on their upcoming visit (i.e. 
“Do you plan on discussing these symptoms with your oncologist at your upcoming visit? Type "1" if you plan to discuss them; Type "2" if you do not plan to discuss them.").   
Clinician surveys  
At 3 and 6 months after patient enrollment, the patient’s oncology clinician team (the attending 
oncologist and associated  advanced practice providers that had an encounter with the patient 
during the study period) will receive an emailed survey to assess the clinicians’ perspectives on 
the utility of the PROStep  Dashboard for the specific patient ( Appendix I).  Clinicians will be 
surveyed for each intervention patient  (arms b and c)  enrolled in the study including patients who 
[ADDRESS_919353] 4 weeks of the enrollment period for the upcoming 
survey. 
Patient  surveys 
At 3 and 6 months after enrollment, all  patients ( arms a, b, and c) will receive a text message 
with a link to a survey to assess the patients’ perspectives (Appendix J).  Patients are eligible to 
receive these surveys if they are enrolled  in the study for a minimum of 4 weeks. 
Patient  exit interviews  
Upon exiting the trial, all intervention patients (arms b and c) will receive a brief exit interview 
to gather feedback.  The CRC will conduct these interviews, and they will consist of the 
following questions: 
1. Overall, what did you think of the intervention?  
2. What parts were the most helpful? 
3. What parts were not helpful?  
4. What should we change?  
5. How often do you have your smart phone in your pocket when you walk around? 
o Never 
o Rarely  
o Sometimes  
o Most of the time  
o Always  
Data collection  
Patient data for outcome determination will be obtained from W2H (for home -based PROs and  
Fitbit device  data), Penn Data Store and Clarity (Epic’s data reporting database, for the 
remaining outcomes).  
9. Analysis plan 
For each primary outcome, we will compare the mean scores from the survey questions at 6 
months (see section 3.1) for all 3 groups (2 intervention, 1 control) using a Kruskal- Wallis test  
with p<0.05 indicating statistical significance.   If the result is significant, we will use the Tukey’s 
honestly significantly difference (HSD) test to test pairwise comparison s. If the outcomes  for any 
arm are skewed  (not normally  distributed), we will use log-transformation  before applying all tests.  For 
[ADDRESS_919354] for Patient A (but not for other  patients).  That said, we will do a sensitivity  analysis only using t he 
coded  6 month analyses (complete  case analysis).  
 
We will repeat this analysis for the secondary outcome of composite survey score at [ADDRESS_919355] been enrolled for a minimum of 4 weeks 
of the enrollment period leading up to their following survey. For example, if a patient dis-
enrolls 4 weeks after receiving their 3 -month utility survey, they will be eligible for their 6 -
month survey whereas a patient who dis- enrolls at 3 weeks will not).  If a patient dies or is 
otherwise unable to complete a survey, they will be omitted from the analysis for the relevant 
outcome.  For patients who disenroll from the trial for any reason (voluntary, death, etc.), but 
meet this  4 week  threshold, their clinicians will receive a utility survey.  To assess whether  
responses in  3-month to 6-month surveys  differ across arms,  we will run an analysis of  covariance 
(ANCOVA)  mode l with the baseline score and  arms  as covariates,  and change  of score as the dependent  
variable.  
 
We will use descriptive statistics to compare the secondary outcomes of adherence rates between 
the two intervention groups and trends in PROstep data. We will use Kruskal -Wallis  tests for 
continuous outcomes and chi- square tests for categorical variables  to compare these outcomes 
between all arms at [ADDRESS_919356] team and Abraham Cancer

[CONTACT_128802] (PMACS) infrastructure, and will only be 
made available to personnel involved in the study through the use of access privileges and 
passwords. Wherever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study -related information. 
Precautions are in place to ensure the data are secure, including use of passw ords and encryption, 
because the research involves web -based surveys.  
 
The W2H Team supports all research studies run on the platform. Default views within the 
platform for all W 2H staff display de-identified participant data. As a part of support and 
troubleshooting, the W2 H team is trained to use only these de- identified views. In rare cases 
where the issue involves viewing ident ifiable participant data, the W2 H team may need to view 
this data to assist the study team. The W2H Team are employees of th e University of 
Pennsylvania and Penn Medicine. All W2H team members have completed HIPAA Security training and CITI Protection of Human Subjects Research Training - ORA.

to these materials. The data to be collected include demographic data (e.g., age, sex, self -
identi fied race, education level), patient baseline characteristics (e.g., comorbidities, performance 
status), disease-related data (e.g., tumor stage, histology), treatment-related data (e.g., line/type 
of therapy), process data (e.g. patient adherence to the i ntervention ), and outcome data (e.g. 
health -related quality of life, symptom burden, step data, acute care utilization). PRO and step

 data will be presented to the patient’s oncology clinician as described above. The remaining data 
that is obtained will be  used for research purposes only. The same procedure used for the 
analysis of automated data sources to ensure protection of patient information will be used for the survey data and chart -abstracted data, in that patient identifiers will be used only for linkage 
purposes or to contact [CONTACT_1962]. The study identification number, and no other identifying information, will be used on all data collection instruments. All study staff will be reminded to 
appreciate the confidential nature of the data collected and  contained in these databases.  
 The Penn Medicine Academic Computing Services (PMACS) will be the hub for the hardware 
and database infrastructure that will support the project and is where the W2H  web portal is 
based. The PMACS is a joint effort of the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center, the Cardiovascular Institute, the Department of Pathology, and the Leonard Davis 
Institute. The PMACS provides a secure computing environment for a large volume of highly 
sensitive data, including clinical, genetic, socioeconomic, and financial information. Among the 
IT projects currently managed by [CONTACT_105473]: (1) the capture and organization of complex, 
longitudinal clinical data via web and clinical applications portals from cancer patients enrolled 
in clinical trials; (2) the integration of genetic array databases and clinical data obtained from 
patients with cardiovascular disease; (3) computational biology and cytometry database management and analyses; (4) economic and health policy research using Medicare claims from 
over [ADDRESS_919360] (HIPAA) training and 
covers secure data transfer, passwords, computer security habits and knowledge of what constitutes misuse or inappropriate use of the server. We will implement multiple, redundant 
protective measures to guarantee the privacy and security of the participant data. All 
investigators and research staff with direct access to the identifiable data will be required to 
undergo annual responsible conduct of research, cybersecurity, and HIPAA certification in 
accordance with University of Pennsylvania regulations.  
 
All data for this project will be stored on the secure/firewalled servers of the PMACS Data 
Center, in data files that will be pro tected by [CONTACT_164259]. These data servers are 
maintained in a guarded facility behind several locked doors, with very limited physical access rights. They are also cyber -protected by [CONTACT_679531]. Electronic access rights are carefully controlled by [CONTACT_679532]. We believe this multi -layer system of data security, identical to 
the system protecting the University of Pennsylvania Health Systems medical records,  greatly 
minimizes the risk of loss of privacy. In addition, risk of loss of confidentiality will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_679533][INVESTIGATOR_679517] t rained study staff. Each subject will

  [ADDRESS_919361] with any issues for which they think 
urgent m edical attention is warranted.  
 Both the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_679518] a participant reports a 
severe symptom (≥3), or any abrupt change in symptom severity (≥2), which will also trigger an 
alert to the patient’s care  team. In this way, multiple physicians will be aware of escalating 
symptoms.  
11.6 Risk/benefit  
  11.6.1 Potential study risks 
A potential risk for patient participants in this study is a b reach of data, as these subjects will be 
reporting information related to their health.  This risk  will be mitigated by [CONTACT_679534]. A second potential risk to patient participants is that 
they may misinterpret this tool as  a means of quick communication with their care team. We will 
take great care to emphasize that the electronic symptom reporting tool is investigational, and not 
a replacement for usual means of communication with one’s care team. Participants will be 
reminded repeatedly, both verbally and via text after each symptom report, that they should 
contact [CONTACT_679535].   A potential risk for clinicians participating in this study is a 
breach of data, which will also be mitigated by [CONTACT_679536].  All potential risks to patient and clinicians are minimal.  
  11.6.2 Potential study benefits 
Potential study benefits include improved recognition by [CONTACT_102]’s oncology clinicians of 
poorly controlled or worsening symptoms and more nuanced perspective on current functional 
status and changes in functional status which may lead to an increase in discussions about 
patients’ p rognosis, goals and wishes (through a Serious Illness Conversation), improved 
symptom management and more informed decision-making regarding cancer treatment plans. 
  11.6.3 Risk/benefit assessment 
Potential risks are minimal and the risk/benefit ratio of this study is very favorable. The study 
team will take necessary steps to maintain confidentiality and privacy throughout the study 
period. Participants will be reminded regularly that electronic reporting of symptoms is not a 
replacement for usual communi cation with their care team.

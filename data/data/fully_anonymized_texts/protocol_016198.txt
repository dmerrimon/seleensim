1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives of this research.  
Response:   The objective of the proposed study is to develop an innovative, friend -based 
motivational intervention (FMI) that encourages and prepares friends to reduce SA risk. Delivered to 
pairs of friends (dyads), the FMI will be designed to foster collaborative ef forts to increase readiness  

 Page 3 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  for, and decrease barriers to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172510] , and to teach and plan together for assault prevention 
skills. As the role of alcohol  has been under -addressed in SA prevention efforts, the FMI also will 
explicitly attend to how intoxication  may serve as a barrier to friend intervention, and strategies for 
overcoming this barrier. The FMI will be d eveloped in three stages  (1. Development, 2.  Implementation  
& Refinement, 3. Preliminary Testing) . In the final stage of the project, the intervention will be teste d in 
a randomized, controlled mini -trial (FMI vs. waitlist control). Friend dyads will be followed in bi -weekly 
online assessments for [ADDRESS_1110067] to incorporate friends into sexual assault 
prevention, and will lay the groundwork for the next steps for the FMI.  
1.2 State the hypotheses to be tested, if applicable.  
Response:  . The first two studies are developmental and exploratory, and intended to be lay the 
foundation for the development and testing of the FMI intervention. Thus, no specific hypotheses are 
forwarded. For the third study, we do have hypotheses about how women will respond to our 
intervention. We expect changes in readiness and other barriers to be associated with 
implementation of FAPBs. We will also use our follow -up data to p rovide a rich description of the role 
of alcohol in implementing FAPBs, and whether the FMI reduces the impact of alcohol use. In 
exploratory analyses, we will examine how the FMI intervention may be associated with decreased 
assault risk, as well as decre ased drinking.  
2.0 Scientific Endpoints  
2.1    Describe  the scientific endpoint, the main result or occurrence under study.   
Response:  The scientific endpoint will be when we have the data to be able to better understand how 
women rely on friendships to prevent alcohol -involved sexual assault, and potential barriers to 
protective action. Another key scientific endpoint is the development and testing of a friend -based 
motivational intervention to be delivered to friend pair s in an effort to prevent sexual assault. Data for 
these endpoints will be derived from qualitative and quantitative assessments across three sequenced 
studies.  
3.[ADDRESS_1110068] themselves and one 
another from sexual assault (SA). Delivered to pairs of friends , this unique intervention will be designed 
to harness the power of friendships to arrive at a personalized, mutual, feasible, and effective approach 
to assault prevention.  
The social context of college sexual assault: Engaging others in prevention:  One of every 
five college women in the U.S. will experience a sexual assault, and as many as 1/2 of these assaults 
involve alcohol (Abbey, 2002; Calhoun et al., 2012;  Testa & Livingston, 2009 ). Although some college 
sexual assaults occur in isolated settings, many - particularly those involving alcohol - develop from 
social occasions, where others are present (Banyard et al., 2004; Koelsch et al., 2012).   Because of 
this, research efforts have begun to focus on understanding the ways in which others in the social 
context –sometimes referred to as by[CONTACT_98696] - may be incorporated into intervention efforts (Banyard 
et al., 2007; Gidycz et al., 2011; Katz & Moore, 2013; Salazar et al., 2014). This literature has been 
informed by [CONTACT_804293]é and Darley (1970), who recognized that in any risk 
situation, those present will have the choice to intervene, or not. Latané and Darley’s model delineates 
a framework outlining five s equential steps that lead a by[CONTACT_804294] a choice for intervention. T hese 
steps include (1) noticing  the event; (2) interpreting  the event as one that requires action; (3) making 
the decision  to act; (4) knowing how to intervene; and (5) implementing  intervention.  
Fundamentals of prevention action: responsibility and relationship.  In the years since 
investigators first began applying Latané and Darley’s model to sexual assault prevention, two factors 
have emerged as being critical to intervention behavior: a sense of personal responsibility  to the 
potential victim, and a personal  relationship  with her. A sense of personal responsibility is among the 
most reliable predictors of action to prevent interpersonal (including sexual) violence (e.g., Banyard & 
Moynihan, 2011; Burn, 2009). Likewise, a close pe rsonal relationship with the potential victim strongly 
predicts intervention action, with closer relationships linearly related to intervention likelihood ( Banyard, 
 Page 4 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  2008; Bennet & Banyard, 2014). In short, without relationship and responsibility, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_804259]. On a college campus, nowhere are relationship and responsibility more likely to be 
found than in a friendship. As such, it is friends who are most likely to intervene. Yet much of the extant 
literature has instead focused on the broader and more general social milieu, targeting by[CONTACT_98696]. This 
misses important opportunities for assault prevention.  
Those most likely to help are not by[CONTACT_98696], but friends.  “By[CONTACT_112815]” interventions typi[INVESTIGATOR_804260]. During the intervention, participants are presented with imaginal vignettes of sexual assault 
scenarios and/or  didactic information about assault recognition and prevention. Such approaches tend 
to focus on providing broad -based information and skills in an effort to change the college culture 
around SA, a nd the likelihood of intervention by [CONTACT_804295] (Banyard et al., 2004; Palm -
Reed et al., 2015). Though these interventions have shown some efficacy in changing by[CONTACT_804296] (Katz & Moore 2013; Kleinsasser et al 2015; Moynihan et al 2011; Salazar et al 
2014), only one study has shown efficacy in reducing rates of sexual assault, a nd this was with high 
school students (Coker et al 2017). This may be because targeting broad groups of by[CONTACT_804297]. Shifting the focus to friends can change this, and can move the field in a new and impactful 
direction.   
Friends are central to the drinking context of college women (Borsari & Carey, 2006) and to the 
context of sexual assault (Planty, 2002). Friends are most frequently in the social setting where sexual 
assault risk first begins to unfold, and when women disclose th at an assault has occurred, it is most 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_804261] (Campbell et al, 2015; Sabina & Ho, 2014). Relevant 
to Latané and Darley’s model of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172510], because of their close personal relationships, friends  
are in an optimal position to identify risk as it emerges (Step 1). That is, a friend is most likely to notice 
when someone has become separated from the rest of the group or appears to be receiving unwanted 
advances, or to detect subtle changes in the po tential victim’s emotions or behaviors that may signal 
danger (Step 2). Further, women report greater intent to help and greater sense of personal 
responsibility (Step 3) to help when a friend rather than a stranger is at risk for SA (Katz et al., 2015). 
Indeed, individuals report being as many as three times more likely to act on behalf of a friend than they 
are a stranger to prevent violence (Bennett et al, 2013, see also Preliminary Studies ). As such, friends 
are most likely to take action (Step 5). Clearly friends have the potential to play a crucial role in 
preventing sexual assault. Yet despi[INVESTIGATOR_804262], no 
interventions have endeavored to explicitly include friends in SA prevention. This is a critical overs ight. 
A motivational intervention can provide a way to effectively harness this potential.    
Motivating friends to prevent sexual assault . Because motivational interventions (MI) are 
designed to capi[INVESTIGATOR_804263] (Miller & Rollnick, 2012), an MI approach lends itself naturally to friend -based change efforts. 
Seve ral studies have used MI in this way (Bourke et al., 2013; Monti, Colby, Mastroleo et al, 2014; 
Magill, Mastroleo et al., 2010; Shepard et al., 2016). In these interventions, the facilitator uses the 
interview to explore the ways in which the naturally exi sting strengths of the friend dyad can be 
leveraged to facilitate behavior change. The focus is on using the dyad to reaffirm and increase shared 
commitment for change, to jointly troubleshoot barriers, to provide concrete support for change efforts, 
and t o identify specific change strategies. Research supports MI for dyads and groups, particularly in 
settings such as the college social environment, where the social context is a critical part of risk (e.g., 
Monti, Colby, Mastroleo et al., 2014; O’Leary -Tevy aw et al, 2007). Moreover, a friend -based MI is well 
suited to addressing several existing challenges to peer -based assault -prevention that have been 
identified in the literature. We describe these challenges below.  
Existing challenges to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172510]; Readiness, Barriers, and Alcohol.  Friends are 
ideally positioned to protect one another against sexual assault. Moreover, they report both desire and 
intentions to do so (Banyard & Moynihan, 2011; Blayney et al., 2016; Bennett et al., 2014). Yet, in many 
cases they do not intervene, due to  several key challenges  that stand in the way (Labhardt et al., 2017; 
Pugh et al., 2016).  For example, often, women do not feel ready  to act to prevent sexual assault in 
others (E xner & Cumings, 2011), and perceive a number of barriers to preventive action. Primary 
among these barriers are low self-efficacy  for knowing whether, when and how to intervene, and 
interpersonal concerns  about peer reactions to intervention. Women also report skills deficits  regarding 
appropriate and effective intervention steps.  
 Page 5 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  Self-efficacy.  When confronted with opportunities to intervene, women report lacking a sense of 
self-efficacy  regarding whether, when, and how to offer such help (Exner & Cumings, 2011; Katz & 
Moore, 2013; see also Preliminary Studies). This appears to stem from a sense of ambiguity that 
women experience about recognizing potential assault situations, knowing how  best to respond, and 
feeling confident regarding whether intervention is wanted or warranted (Pugh et al., 2016).  
Interpersonal concerns  are another key barrier to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172510]. These concerns, pertaining to 
how others will respond to help efforts, or whether such efforts will damage the relationship, have been 
identified as among the strongest reasons given for failure to engage in pe er-based intervention 
behavior (Armstrong et al., 2014; Bennett et al., 2014; Bennett et al, 2013). Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (see 
Preliminary Studies) are consistent with this; the majority of women in our sample report concerns 
about how frien ds may react to efforts to intervene to prevent assault, and highlight these concerns as 
a major barrier to preventive action.  
Skills.   Critically, women lack either the knowledge of or the ability to implement specific, 
behavioral skills  that are necessary for successful peer -based intervention (Bennett et al., 2013).  
Recent work by [CONTACT_804298] (2014) and Armstrong et al. (2014) has identified several peer -directed 
behavior strategies specifically geared toward assault prevention. These assa ult-specific protective 
behaviors are both conceptually and empi[INVESTIGATOR_804264]. In contrast to more general alcohol protective behaviors (e.g., Martens et al. 
2005), these peer -based strategies are designed for friends to use to help one another, and focus on 
shared behaviors that may prevent sexual assault. Strategies include such steps  as formulating a pact 
or safety plan ahead of time, making sure that everyone from group stays together, having “signals” to 
friends when someone is making unwanted advances, or texting a code word to friends when 
assistance or interruption is needed. Inc reasing knowledge of, motivation for, and engagement in these 
friend -based, assault prevention behavior skills (FAPB) is one of the objectives of this study.  
Alcohol and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172510] . Alcohol is a major risk factor for SA and also a significant 
impediment to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172510]. As intoxication increases, women are less likely to engage in peer -
directed protective behaviors (Leone et al., 2017). This includes impairing willingness to intervene, and 
the ability to ascertain risk or to engage in helpful by[CONTACT_358514] (Fleming & Wiersma -Mosley, 
2015; Pugh et al, 2016). These data are consistent with our own preliminary focus group work (see 
Preliminary Studies ), in which women identified  alcohol consumption as a factor that may compromise 
their ability to recognize risk amongst their friends. Yet the role of alcohol has not been well addressed 
in peer -based intervention efforts, and examinations of alcohol’s influence on intervention outc omes are 
rare (see Pugh et al., 2016, Leone et al., 2017). Our FMI will address this gap.  
A friend -based MI can address these challenges . The literature reviewed above points to 
important but resolvable barriers to intervening that can be addressed within an MI framework. A friend -
based intervention is especially well -suited to addressing and overcoming these barriers, cultivating the 
relationship and responsibility that already e xist within friendships, and collaboratively addressing the 
challenges that stand in the way. Such an intervention also can target the ways that friends are 
uniquely re levant to all five steps of assault prevention according to Latané  and Darley’s model. 
Specific skills that incorporate friends can be discussed, agreed upon, and practiced together. Friends 
can work together toward a sense of self -efficacy for intervention, fostered through the collaborative 
processes of MI. Importantly , given that some of the most significant barriers to peer -based intervention 
pertain explicitly to social relationships (interpersonal concerns) and the social context, a friend -based 
dyad is an excellent mode of intervention, as it works within women’s natural social environments, and 
can explicitly address interpersonal concerns.  Finally, because women typi[INVESTIGATOR_804265], a friend based intervention is ideal for addressing how alcohol 
may impede assault prevention efforts, and ways to overcome this challenge.  
The proposed Intervention: In this work, we propose to develop an intervention that use MI’s, 
“collaborative conversation style for strengthening commitment to change” (Miller & Rollnick, 2012; p. 
12), to motivate and prepare women to work together to reduce SA risk. Consistent with the peer -based 
MI literature (see Monti et al., 2014; Miller & Rose, 2010), this intervention will target ways that the 
friend dyad may supp ort, encourage, and share responsibility with one another in protecting against 
SA. The Friend -based MI (FMI) will then use the responsibility and relationship of friends as a 
framework to foster collaborative efforts to increase readiness  and decrease barriers  to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_464555]. As part of this, the FMI will focus on the identification and implementation of skills  friends can 
use to help one another prevent sexual assault. (see C.2. Procedure  for details ). We also will 
 Page 6 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  incorporate a focused discussion of the ways drinking may impede helpi[INVESTIGATOR_804266]. Moreover, the FMI will encourage 
women to identify specific strategies for reducing the effects of alcohol on helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. These  potential 
strategies will be explored in Stage 1, and included in the FMI in Stages 2 and 3.   This is important, 
given alcohol’s role in the assault context, and innovative, as such a discussion is not a typi[INVESTIGATOR_804267] -based interventions (e.g ., by[CONTACT_804299]). Though decreasing drinking is 
not the objective of the intervention, it is plausible that our FMI will reduce consumption. Thus, we will 
examine drinking outcomes in secondary analysis.

utilization among heavy -drinking college students. Addictive Behaviors, [ADDRESS_1110075] will provide initial development and testing 
of a friend -based motivational intervention (FMI) designed 
to reduce SA risk. We also will address how to minimize 
the impact of alcohol o n helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172510], test whether 
drinking reduces intervention efficacy, and examine 
potential iatrogenic effects of the intervention.  
 We will use an iterative 3 -stage approach to 
achieve this goal (Krueger & Casey, 2012; Figure 1). 
Across the three stages, we will develop a FMI that seeks 
to increase readiness for intervention , and decrease 
barriers  to intervening, with a focus on collaboratively 
identifying appropriate friend -based assault prevention 
behavioral skills (FAPB). Finally, we will incorporate a 
discussion of and strategies to reduce alcohol’s effects on 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. In Stage 1, we develop th e initial intervention and 
then gather student feedback, with a focus on feasibility  
and personal relevance  regarding the implementation of 
this intervention. We also will conduct stakeholder interviews. In Stage 2, we will deliver the FMI to a 
small sample of friend dyads in an open trial with a brief (4 week) follow -up. The FMI will then be 
refined based on participant feedback and research team input. Stages 1 and 2 thus will build a 
prototype intervention to be tested in Stage 3: a small -scale, randomized controlled trial.  
We begin with our approach to screening, eligibility, and recruitment (consistent across all stages). We 
also describe interventionist selection, training, and supervision for Stages 2 and 3. Finally, procedures 
for all three stages  are described, stage by [CONTACT_64367] (see also Timeline in Personnel Justification ). 
 
Screening, Eligibility, and Recruitment (All Stages)  
 
Because women who drink heavily are at greatest risk for SA, we will recruit heavy drinking (i.e. 4 or 
more drinks in a single sitting [HED] [ADDRESS_1110076] 3 months) women into our sample. 
These women will be recruited via campus and commu nity-wide advertisements for a study of 
“women’s social experiences”. Telephone screens will be used to determine eligibility. For Stages [ADDRESS_1110077] meet HED criteria. Additional eligibility 
criteri a will be that each individual in the dyad reports going out (not necessarily drinking) together > 
1/week, and identifies the other dyad member a close friend. Eligible  participants will be scheduled for a 
focus group session (for Stage 1) or for an initial intervention assessment session (for Stages 2, 3). 
Women must be college students, but can be from any of the greater Buffalo area’s nine colleges. 
Thus, development will not be based on a single campus.  
 
Recruitment Considerations : All kinds of friends could be valuable in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_804269]. In the 
proposed study, we focus on female dyads with [ADDRESS_1110078] chosen these 
dyad characteristics in this early phase of development for several reasons.  

 Page 12 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  Stage 1: Intervention Development  
Aim 1.  (Development) Develop a brief, motivational intervention designed to enhance friend 
engagement in the prevention of SA (Friend -Enhanced MI; FMI).  
 
We will draw from existing assault prevention literature, preliminary data, investigator and consultant 
input, and focus group feedback to develop an intervention designed to use the relationship context 
of the friend dyad to promote changes in the attitudes ( readiness , perceived barriers ), and skills  
(friend assault protective behaviors: FAPB) needed to act to ensure friends’ safety. The intervention 
will address how alcohol  may impede prevention behaviors.   
 
Stage 1 Procedures  
 Intervention Development.  Stage 1 will involve the development of the FMI intervention  manual. 
Initially, co -Is Read, Livingston, Testa, and Katz, and consultant Mastroleo will meet regularly via 
conference calls and in -person meetings to determine the intervention’s basic structure and content. 
These discussions will be guided by [CONTACT_804319]/consultant expertise, our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], the assault 
prevention literature, and by [CONTACT_804320] -based MIs (e.g., Monti et al., 2014) that will help to provide a 
templat e for the intervention structure. Below, w e provide a general  description of what we expect will 
be the core features of FMI, though this intervention will evolve based on the results of  our 
developmental work.  
This two hour  intervention will use MI techniques and principles to reaffirm a sense of commitment 
to the relationship, a shared sense of responsibility  to protecting one another against sexual assault. 
The FMI protocol will include a discussion of the social context of SA, naturalistic efforts women report 
making to help their friends, and information (reviewed above) regarding how and why friends are well-
positioned to help one another . The tone will be positive and affirming. The goal is to enhance a sen se 
of shared commitment to one another’s well -being, without engendering a sense of onus or liability.  
The FMI will seek to enhance readiness  for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_804270] (Steps 2,  3, 5 in 
Latané &  Darley)  and to decrease barriers  to intervening (Steps 3 & 4). Barriers to be addressed  
includ e interpersonal concerns  that may be of particular relevance  in the context of a friendship , and 
the introduction and discussion of friend assault prevention behavioral skills  (FAPB; Steps 4 and 5) . 
These skills will be based on those identified by [CONTACT_804321]. (2014) and Armstrong et al., (2014 ; Step 
4; see Measures  for examples) and on pi[INVESTIGATOR_804271] 1. Another goal of the intervention will be 
to increase knowledge about alcohol’s effects  on helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172510]  (Steps 4, 5)  by [CONTACT_804322] . The FMI also will inc lude a discussion of how friends can 
recognize assault risk in one another (Steps 1 and 2  Participants will be instructed as to how to help 
without putting themselves in harm’s way. During the intervention, friends will be encouraged to 
practice and to support one another in implementing these FAPB, enhancing self -efficacy. Lastly, the 
FMI will include a collaborative development of a prototype safety plan (Step 5) for risk situations, 
weighing the pros and cons of various plans, identifying potential ba rriers, and steps to overcome these 
barriers. Throughout, the interview will  focus on peer support for behavior change , encouragement of 
one another in change efforts, and shared responsibility for overcoming barriers  (e.g., Monti et al., 
2014) .  
 
 Focus group feedback.  It is critical that this intervention be feasible for implementation within the 
context of real friendships and naturalistic socializ ing patterns – a context that often includes drinking . 
To this end, we will present the FMI to focus groups (approximately 4  groups , 5 per group, n=20) to 
gather feedback regarding how our intervention may be received by [CONTACT_804323]. Specifically, we 
will use t hese focus groups to gather information on the degree to which critical aspects of the 
intervention  are seen as : (1) personally relevant to the risks and barriers women confront and (2) 
feasible to implement , and (3) potential iatrogenic effects  (e.g., personal safety concerns, relationship 
concerns , guilt about looking after others ).     
 
Stakeholder interviews.  To gather information about the need, feasibility, and acceptability of the 
FMI from a campus perspective, and with consideration for next steps  (scalability, generalizability)  for 
the FMI, [ADDRESS_1110079] likely to implement or recommend the intervention on the campus. In these 
interviews, a detailed overview of the FMI will be presented to obtain feedback regarding benefits and 
 Page 13 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  limitations of the FMI, including cost, broader dissemination,  and overlap  with existing campus  
programs.   
 
 Remuneration . Women will be compensated for focus group participation with $5 0 in cash. 
Stakeholders will receive a $ 25 in cash  as a gesture of appreciation.  
 
Finalization of the FMI.  At the end of Stage 1, we will review initial focus group and stakeholder 
feedback to make additional modifications to the intervention to enhance feasibility, personal relevance 
(focus groups) and campus appeal (stakeholders). Once the FMI’s preliminary structure and  content 
are complete, it will be ready for a first -round implementation with the target population, Stage 2   
 
Stage 2: Preliminary Implementation and Further Refinement   
Aim 2.  Conduct an initial open trial of this intervention with short -term (4 -week) follow -up, and then 
modify based on feedback and outcomes.     
 
1. We will conduct an open trial of our FMI intervention (friend dyads n= 10, 20 women) and 
comprehensively evaluate the intervention via multiple methods (investigator observations, 
open -trial sessions, feedback interviews) during and post -intervention.  
2. We will use feedback from the open trial to further refine the FMI intervention.  
 
Stage 2: Specific  Procedures  for Preliminary Implementation and Evaluation  
 
a. Open Trial & Short -Term Follow -Up 
Open Trial : We will conduct an open trial (N= 10 dyads) of the FMI. Open trial eligibility will be 
determined using procedures outlined above ( see Screening & Recruitment ).Trained clinical Ph.D.  
students  will conduct  these sessions . At the end of each session, participants will give both structured 
(self-report measures) and semi -structured (interview) feedback regarding their impressions of the 
intervention.  Note that the facilitator who gathers feedback will be different from the FMI interventionist.  
Participants will have the option to complete all the online questionnaires prior to coming in for their 
session (within a week of their ses sion).   
Immediately following the completion of the intervention, doctoral -student facilitators  will present 
open -ended questions  to the friend dyad  about each of the content domains  of the intervention. The 
goal will be to stimulate a conversation between dyad members about their perceptions of the 
intervention. Specifically, these dyad interviews will be used to gather information on two critical 
aspects of the intervention that we have developed: (1) whether the intervention is seen as personally 
relevant with r egard to the risks women confront and how they may minimize these risks and (2) 
whether the FMI material is perceived as being feasible to implement  in a real world risk environment . 
As part of this, we will elicit feedback on the extent to which the intervention adequately addresses 
barriers to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], including effects of alcohol consumption. We will also solicit information on 
additional potential barriers to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_804272]. This feedback data 
will be used in concert with investigator and consultant input to further refine the FMI.   
Short -term Follow -up. Participants in the Open Trial also will be asked to implement the skills and 
safety plan developed in the intervention over a four -week period. After which they will participate in a 
follow -up interview.  Prior to completing the follow -up interview, participants will complete online self -
report measures. These measures may be completed prior to the session (within a week of the 
session).  Dyad members will be interviewed first separately, then together. The objective of this follow -
up will be to evaluate participant experiences of implementing the intervention material. All interviews 
will be conducted by a doctoral -level trainee. This feedback will be semi -structured, and will ask largely 
about issues pertaining to the implementation of intervention skills in a real -world setting, whether 
friends used any strategies to protect one another that were not covered in the intervention a nd how 
effective they perceived these strategies to be. We also will discuss how alcohol consumption may 
have influenced implementation of skills learned in the FMI. Finally, we will query about potential 
iatrogenic effects.  Participants who are unable to come in for an in -person follow -up (due to extraneous 
circumstances), will be offered the opportunity to complete the follow -up via teleconferencing (using 
Zoom).  
We also will elicit systematic feedback from interventionists regarding the implementation of the 
intervention (e.g., perceptions regarding participant response, etc .). This feedback will be derived from 
group -based interviews with interventionists, conducted at the end of the open trial.  
Remuneration.  Open T rial participants will be paid $50  for participating in the intervention and 
feedback session s. They will receive an additional $10 bonus if the pair is scheduled for an 
appointment within 72 hours of being contact[CONTACT_804324].  For pairs who are completing the follow -
 Page 14 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  up via teleconferencing, they will be paid using the phone application Venmo or with an Amazon gift 
card (depending on their choice).  
 
b. Further Refineme nt  
In this stage, feedback from assessment and the post -session interviews will be aggregated , 
analyzed, and used to refine the FMI intervention. All intervention sessions in the open trial will be 
digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts of the post -session semi -structured interviews will be 
created by [CONTACT_804325] a week of the interview . An encrypted audio file will be distributed to 
investigators  to enable them to  review feedback independently and then meet to discuss impressions. 
Three sessions will be selected randomly and distributed to consultant Mastroleo, who will review 
sessions and provide written feedback regarding modifications .  
Information gathered from the Open Trial will be used to refine intervention elements as well as 
procedures for training , recruitment , and adherence materials. Investigators and consultant Mastroleo  
will continue to meet monthly to discuss emerging impressions, reactions to feedback, and ideas for 
modification. When all open trial and follow -up sessions are completed, we will hold an  Investigator and 
Consultant meeting. At this meeting, we will synthesize qualitative and quantitative feedback and 
finalize plans for revising the FMI protocol . If warranted , based on participant feedback and the extent 
of the revisions, a second open trial with new dyads will be carried out to further refine the FMI 
intervention protocol.  
 
Stage  3: Intervention Testing  
 
Aim 3.  Conduct a mini -trial with 3 -month follow -up via weekly assessments to examine changes in 
target attitudes (readiness, barriers) and behaviors (friend -based assault prevention behavior skills). 
We also will examine knowledge and strategies pertaining to th e role of alcohol in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172510], and 
will test whether drinking influences the implementation and efficacy of this intervention.  
 
Twenty -four friend dyads will participate in the FMI along with [ADDRESS_1110080] control dyads (total of 48 
dyads). We will compare groups on outcomes at post -intervention and at bi -weekly [ADDRESS_1110081] participants receiving the FMI to 
demonstrate signi ficant increases in readiness, and engagement in FAPBs and alcohol strategies, 
and decreases in perceived barriers (improved self -efficacy, relationship concerns), at post -
intervention and over the [ADDRESS_1110082] of 
alcohol use. In exploratory analyses, we will examine whether the intervention may be associated 
with decreased assault risk, as well as decr eased drinking (see Data Analysis Plan).   
 
Stage 3 Procedures:  
Intervention: FMI Mini -Controlled Trial with Intensive Follow -Up 
In this stage, we will test the finalized FMI (see Screening, Eligibility, and Recruitment  above) . 
To do this, we will contrast outcomes among those in this trial (N=24 dyads) with 24 pairs of friend 
dyads (total dyad N=48) who are randomly assigned to a wait list control condition.  
The FMI will consist of a single session. Sessions will be offered on many days and times across 
the week to accommodate variability in student schedules. Each session will begin with a baselin e 
assessment . In this session, women will be provided with the refined intervention protocol and will have 
the opportunity to role play and practice implementing the skills and strategies. Following the 
intervention, participants will be encouraged  to utilize the skills and strategies presented in the 
intervention over the next 12 weeks, when ever they are out with their friend in a social context.   
Dyad pairs assigned randomly (stratified on drinking levels, sexual assault history, and age) to the 
wait list control  condition  will be assessed once at baseline and again [ADDRESS_1110083] -baseline. 
Assessment measures (baseline, 12 weeks) will mirror those administered to women in the FMI 
condition. At the completion of the 12 week “wait list,” participants will be administered the FMI a nd 
followed for [ADDRESS_1110084] -intervention assessments 
(with the fi rst assessment to occur within 2  week s of FMI completion) for 12 weeks. The bi-
 Page 15 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  weekly structure  will optimally capture women’s experiences applying strategies from the 
intervention. Participants will be reminded of follow -up assessments by [CONTACT_648], text, and email 
prompt.  Individual members of the dyad will be interviewed in the unlikely event that the other 
member is lost to follow up over the brief follow -up period. At the end of the 12 weeks, 
participants will be contact[CONTACT_232358].  
Stakeholder interviews.  In this second set of stakeholder interviews, we will gather information 
to inform next steps  for the FMI intervention . To this end , a series of 5 interviews ([ADDRESS_1110085]) will be conducted with campus administrator s at Buffalo -area 
colleges. Selection will follow procedures outlined in Stage 1. In these interviews, the final FMI manual 
will be presented, and feedback would be solicited regarding ideas for scaling the FMI to other 
populations and contexts.  
 Remuneration.  Students will receive electronic gift card payments of $40 for the baseline 
assessment (which occurs just prior to the intervention) and $[ADDRESS_1110086] 4/6 bi-weekly assessments will 
receive a $20 bonus. Stakeholders will receive $25 in cash  as a gesture of appreciation for 
participation.     
Selection, Training and Supervision of Interventionists (Stage 2 & 3)   
 
Selection.  Interventionists will be doctoral trainees. Training and supervision procedures are detailed 
below.  
Training.  Interventionists will receive intensive training which will consist of (a) a 2 -day training 
workshop on MI with Drs. Mastroleo and Read, (b) reviewing  tapes and model BMI sessions from 
previous research, (c) individual reading of the intervention manual, (d) digitally recorded mock 
interviews followed by [CONTACT_804326], and (e) weekly group supervision and tape 
review with [CONTACT_804355].  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_804273] a mock session rated as 
acceptable by [CONTACT_804327].   
    Supervision.  Treatment providers will attend weekly supervision meetings with [CONTACT_804354]. These 
meetings will be supplemented with monthly phone supervision with [CONTACT_712497]. All sessions will be 
digitally recorded. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_804274] 30% of the sessions, randomly selected, and will review for use in 
ongoing supervision. In addition, [CONTACT_712497] will listen to one randomly chosen session per 
interventionist per month and comple te the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Code (MITI) 
and rel evant adherence questionnaire.  During individual phone supervision sessions, [CONTACT_712497] will 
provide feedback to interventionists based on her review of session tapes. This follows fidelity 
procedures that we have used previously  (R01AA016564; Read).

 Page 19 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  10.[ADDRESS_1110099] data (e.g. 
questionnaire, interview guide, validated instrument, data collection form).   
 
Instruments & Measures  (For Stage 3)  
 
Data collection will occur at baseline and bi -weekly assessments, and a final evaluation that will be 
administered at the end of the last bi -weekly assessment. At baseline, we will collect demographic data, as 
well as drinking and sexual victimization history, and descriptive information regarding the relati onship of 
the friends in our dyads. Other self -report measures will be administered both at baseline and then weekly 
during the follow -up periods (as denoted below). In the final (exit interview) evaluation, we will obtain 
feedback on participants’ percept ions of the intervention and potential iatrogenic effects.  All self -report 
measures may be completed prior to the session.   
 
The proposed intervention will be designed to use relationship and responsibility in friend dyads as the 
basis for decreasing perceived barriers to intervention, improving readiness for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_277917], increasing 
knowledge about alcohol’s effects on helpi [INVESTIGATOR_804275], and imparting friend -based helpi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. These attitudes and behaviors will be the target 
intervention outcomes. Sexual assault will be examined as a secondary outcome. Changes in drinking  also 
will be examined though this is not the principal focus of the intervention.  
 
Baseline Assessment  
Demographic (baseline). Demographic variables will be assessed, including sex, age, ethnicity, sexual 
orientation, family history of alcohol problems, living situation (with family, friends, alone, etc), work status, 
year in school, romantic relationships, and weight (for BAC cal culations).  
Sexual Assault (baseline).  A revised version of the Sexual Experiences Survey (RSES; Koss et al, 
2007; will be used to measure a spectrum of sexual victimization experiences . At baseline, lifetime 
experiences will be assessed. This will enable us to examine whether SA history affects intervention 
efficacy, or intervention response (e.g., guilt, blame, other possible iatrogenic effects) in exploratory 
analyses.  
Drinking history (baseline).  A variety of alcohol behaviors and related outcomes will be assessed. 
Using a grid -based average assessment measure, participants will report on typi[INVESTIGATOR_804276] (for relevant comparison of follow -up data) and past yea r (for descriptive 
purposes), including the average number of drinks consumed per occasion, and the average time over 
which drinks were consumed (for blood alcohol calculations). Harmful drinking outcomes will be assessed 
with t he 48 -item Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (YAACQ; Read et al., 2006, 2007). We 
will also assess frequency of drinking in various contexts including parties, bars, etc. to assess patterns of 
exposure to high risk contexts.  
Relationship information (baseline).  We will assess the duration and origin of the friendship, as well 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_804277]. Note that at baseline we will assess level of closeness to confirm 
eligibility. Dyads who do not identify one another as a “close friend” will be excl uded from participation.   
 
Bi-Weekly Follow -Up Assessment  
 
Overview:  Bi-weekly, participants will report on any occasion since the last assessment that the participant 
was out with the target friend in a social setting. For each such occasion, we will collect information about 
the context of these occasions (i.e., bar, par ty, out to dinner), whether there was alcohol, who was present, 
and whether there was an opportunity for intervention.   
 
Friend -Based Assault Prevention Behavior Skills (FAPB)   
Peer-Directed By[CONTACT_804328] (Baseline, bi -weekly). We will use 
the 49-item By[CONTACT_804329] (Banyard et al., 2014), which includes 4 subscales (1) 
the identification of sexual assault risk situations, (2) accessing resources, (3) planning ahead for risk 
situations, and (4) safety behaviors in risk set tings. This measure will be adapted to include a broader 

 Page 20 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  range of protective behaviors based on findings at Stage 1, and some of the items that refer to intimate 
partner violence will need to be reworded to assess sexual violence. Participants will complete this 
measure with respect to their target friend (i.e.,  did they do this for their friend) and also for themselves 
(i.e., did their friend do this for them?).  
Sexual Assault -Related Protective Behaviors  (baseline, bi -weekly for all drinking occasions) . A 
measure developed by [CONTACT_312092]., the Women’s Peer -Directed Protective Strategy questionnaire 
(WPPS) will be used to evaluate assault -specific protective behaviors. This 24 item measure includes items 
such as, “ I try to be aware and monitor where my friends are at all times ,” and, “ I watch out for my friends in 
an attempt to keep them away from (risk) situations ”.  Participants will complete this measure for  their 
target friend (i.e., did they do this for their friend?) and also for themselves (i.e., did their friend do this for 
them?). Participants will be asked to rate frequency and how effective they perceived each behavior to be. 
They also will rate how t hey felt about it when they or their friend engaged in the behavior or did not 
engage in the behavior (when there was an opportunity) using a brief checklist of positive and negative 
feelings (e.g., good, relieved, safe, guilty, angry, scared). This will b e based on information from qualitative 
participant interviews at earlier stages.  
We also will assess whether the intervention resulted in unanticipated or adverse consequences, such as 
placing undue stress on a member of the dyad , or straining the friendship.  
 
Readiness  
Readiness to Intervene (baseline, bi -weekly). Participants will rate readiness for intervening on a 10 -
point likert -type scale, modeled after the Readiness Ruler (CEBP, 2010) . This scale will be used in the FMI 
discussion, and also will be examined over follow -up (Moyers et al., 2009).  
Decisional Balance (baseline, bi -weekly) . The 10 -item Decisional Balance Scale (Banyard et al., 2007) 
will be used to assess  ambivalence about intervening in a potential assault situation. Responses regarding 
the decision about whether to intervene are rated along a 5 -point Likert -type scale. Scores are computed 
for pros, cons, and negative consequences of intervention for each  social occasion with the target friend.  
 
Awareness and Strategies Regarding Alcohol Effects on Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_804278]’s effects on helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172510] (baseline, post - and 12 weeks; 
strategies also assessed bi -weekly).We will assess participant understanding of the ways that alcohol may 
interfere with helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172510]. Questions will include levels at which alcohol is most likely to inhibit helpi[INVESTIGATOR_464555] (i.e., BACs of .08 or higher; Davis et al., 2009) and knowledge of alcohol’s e ffects on risk 
recognition and responding. Based on focus group work (Stage 1) and collaborative discussions during the 
FMI, friends will generate a list of personalized strategies to be used to sustain helpi[INVESTIGATOR_804279], despi[INVESTIGATOR_804280] (from Fillmore et al., 2000; Grattan & Vogel -
Sprott. 2001). Strategies will include efforts such as sending pre -timed text reminders to check on friend, 
making plans for one member of the dyad to commit to moderate alcohol consu mption, etc. In bi -weekly 
assessments, participants will be asked to what extent they engaged in these strategies during social 
occasions that involved alcohol.  
 
Assault and Drinking Outcomes  
Alcohol Consumption (bi -weekly, all drinking occasions) . Using a grid -based average assessment 
measure based in the Daily Drinking Questionnaire (Collins et al., 1985), participants will report on alcohol 
consumption, on occasions when they were out with the target friend. See above for detailed description.  
Sexual assault (bi -weekly ). This intervention is designed to target risk for a full range of non -
consensual sexual experiences, from unwanted sexual attention, to completed rape. Because lower -
severity events are more frequent and may signify risk for higher severity events, it may be in lower -
severity situations where there is greatest opportunity for intervention. Following Kelley -Baker (2008) for 
assessing assault -events for particular occasions, we will use the Revised SES to assess each social 
occasion with the target friend in the prior week. Each item will be coded 1( yes) or 0 ( no), based on 
whether it happened to the woman/friend on each occasion that the pair socialized together.   
 Page 21 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  Alcohol -Related Protective Behaviors (baseline, bi -weekly ). Because one strategy women may use to 
decrease assault risk is to limit their own and friend’s alcohol consumption, we will administer the 
Protective Behaviors Strategy Survey (PBSS; Martens et al., 2005).   
 
Treatment Evaluation.  (Used in Stages 2, 3; from Borsari et al., 2007)  
     End of Session Questionnaire . Completed at the end of the intervention session, this 6 -item measure 
evaluates the participant’s perceptions of the personal relevance of and engagement in the session. 
Participants also will complete a 1page survey that asks about their experiences in the session.  
     End of Treatment Questionnaire . This 48 -item measure assesses participant perceptions of the 
helpfulness of each treatment component on a scale from -3 (greatly harmful ) to +3 ( greatly helpful ). 
Participants will also be asked to elaborate on their perceptions of what was helpful and/or harmful (i.e., 
iatrogenic effects).  
 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_804281]. (Used in Stages 2, 3)  
Brief Intervention Adherence Checklist . Following prior MI studies (Barnett et al. 2007; Murphy et al., 
2010), 25% of the interviews will be selected randomly for review by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mastroleo. Two aspects will be 
assessed, Content and MI Adherence. [CONTACT_712497] will complete a [ADDRESS_1110100] ba sed on the FMI 
components ( content ), to evaluate whether each intervention component was covered (Moyers et al., 
2010), as well as the MITI (below) for each session to determine whether interventionists maintain MI 
proficiency.  
 Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Code Version 3.1.1 (MITI 3.1.1; Moyers et al., 2010)  The 
MITI evaluates interventionist adherence to MI principles. Randomly -selected 20 -minute segments of the 
session are coded. The MITI contains global and behavior components. The global ratings are (a) 
evocation; (b) collaboration; (c) autonomy/support; ( d) direction; (e) empathy; (f) acknowledging change 
talk; and (g) inviting change talk. The behavior counts assess (a) MI adherent (e.g., emphasizing self -
efficacy) and MI non -adherent (e.g., confronting) behaviors; (b) the types of questions; (c) types of 
reflections, and (d) providing information. As the FMI is built on a MI framework, it is crucial to examine 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_804282], empathy, and autonomy/support infused 
through the session interaction. As MI focuses on attaining high ratings in these areas as more predictive 
of behavior change (Miller & Rollnick, 2012), our ability to evaluate if and how well the thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_804283] a crucial aspect of intervention fidelity.  
 
Relationship Quality  
Effects on the relationship are among the primary concerns that women cite regarding intervening in 
potential assault situations. Thus, we will examine whether the intervention has any influence on the 
relationship quality. Further, given that relationship  and responsibility are strong predictors of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_464555], we also will examine these as potential moderators of intervention outcome in exploratory 
analysis.  
Relationship Quality (baseline, follow -up).  A brief 5 -item version of the Network of Relationships 
Inventory (NRI, Furman & Buhrmester, 1985) will be used to assess relationship quality (companionship, 
reassurance of worth, intimate disclosure, reliable alliance, and affection).  These items will be augmented 
with items that query about the sense of working as a team toward one another’s safety, and to what extent 
they were supporting one another’s change efforts (e.g., “I felt like we worked together to f ollow our safety 
plans .”).  
 Responsibility (Baseline, bi -weekly) . We will assess Responsibility using a [ADDRESS_1110101] et al. (2007) that reflects taking responsibility for preventing sexual or other forms of interpersonal 
violence. This measure will be adapted to reflect a sense of responsibility to the target friend in the dyad.  
 
Exit interview  
Following the [ADDRESS_1110102] reactions to or thoughts about the intervention, to 
pose questions, or inquire about resources. At this interview we also will elicit ideas for application in other 
settings and populations, and other friend types (e.g., male friends, non -drinking friends, etc.). This 
 Page 22 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  interview will give participants a chance to talk with project staff about anything that was distressing over 
the trial/[ADDRESS_1110103] data about subjects (e.g. school records, electronic 
medical records).  
Response:  N/A. No source records will be used in this study.  
10.[ADDRESS_1110104] results, such as results of investigational diagnostic tests, 
genetic tests, or incidental findings will be shared with subjects or others  
Response:  No individual results will be shared with participants or others . 
10.6 Indicate whether or not study results will be shared with subjects or others, and if so, describe 
how these will be shared.  
Response:  Study results will be shared with participants on our study website, as they are available.  
11.0 Study Timelines  
11.1 Describe the anticipated duration needed to enroll all study subjects.  
Response:  We expect that all study subjects wil l be enrolled within the first 2.[ADDRESS_1110105]’s participation in the study. Include length of study visits, and 
overall study follow -up time.  
Response:  Once enrolled, participants wil l be followed over a period of 3 months .

13.0 Resources and Qualifications  
13.1 Describe the qualifications (e.g., education, training, experience, expertise, or certifications) of 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_145523].  When applicable describe their 
knowledge of the local study sites, culture, and society.  Provide enough information to convince 
the IRB that you have qualified staff for the proposed research .  
Response:  [CONTACT_804354]’s work has focused on the complex intersection of trauma (including sexual 
victimization) and alcohol misuse. She also has examined developmental pathways to risk behaviors 
from early to late adolescence and into young adulthood. These studies hav e employed longitudinal, 
web-based methods such as those that will be used in the proposed study. [CONTACT_804354] has assembled 
an outstanding team of investigators who are ideally suited to ensure the successful completion of 
this project’s aims. All members bri ng unique and critical expertise to the project. All study staff will 
be well trained in research procedures, and in ethical treatment of human subjects. All members of 
the study will complete CITI training.  
Describe other resources available to conduct the research.

student line.  
13.3 Describe the availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects might need as a 
result of anticipated consequences of the human research, if applicable.  
Response:  All links to the study survey will include a referral list and contact [CONTACT_804331]/traumatic events stressful or upsetting.  This referral list will explicitly include local and national 
resources for both trauma and also substance misuse.  In addition, as we have done in the previous 
web-based studies, we have a “ Request for Contact ” button that appears at the end of the web 
survey. Participants are instructed to click on this button if they are distressed and would like to talk to a 
member of the project staff. Clicking this will generate an e -mail to our staff, and [CONTACT_804354] will co ntact 
the participant within two business days. This will give participants who are distressed and/or who have 
experienced a recent event to discuss both treatment and reporting options with a mental health 
professional.  
13.4 Describe your process to ensure that all persons assisting with the research are adequately 
informed about the protocol, the research procedures, and their duties and functions.  
Response:   See above and also the Study Timeline. There is time allotted for training of staff in study 
procedures, including necessary duties and functions.  
14.0 Other Approvals  
14.1 Describe any approvals that will be obtained prior to commencing the research (e.g., school, 
external site, funding agency, laboratory,  or biosafety).  
Response:   
☒ N/A:  This study does not require any other approvals.  
15.[ADDRESS_1110111] subjects’ privacy interests during the course of this 
research.  
Response:  Participants will be assessed at three points annually, for three weeks each (a total of 9 
weekly assessments per year) . A more comprehensive baseline assessment will precede the first of the 
three weekly assessments.  In an effort to prevent or minimize discomfort or embarrassment in 
responding to questions we will reiterate our procedures for protecting participant confidentiality in on -
line questionnaires. Participants will be informed that study participation is entirely voluntary, and that 
they may choose not to participate without any consequence to them. Further, participants also will be 
informed that they may skip specific items within the online surve y if they so choose. Detailed 
procedures for protecting electronic data are described within the body of this proposal, and include the 
creation of random ID numbers which are later hooked into a “hash ID”. Thus, at no point are identifying 
information and participant data lin ked in cyberspace. We will further safeguard against breaches of 
confidentiality by [CONTACT_804332][INVESTIGATOR_804285] (i.e., identifying in formation is stored in 
a separate electronic file with a separate password, accessible only to project staff). Further, no 
individuals will be identified by [CONTACT_804333], seminars, pr ofessional presentations, or papers. Finally, we will obtain a Certificate of 
Confidentiality from NIH for this study, as an additional protection of confidentiality of data. Participants 
will be informed that this is in place. All links to the study survey will include a referral list and co ntact 
information for participants to reach someone for additional support in the event that they find the 
reporting of psychosocial stressors/traumatic events stressful or upsetting.  
Finally, participants may be concerned about the confidentiality of their responses. Data show that 
under -reporting of substance use is reduced when participants believe assurances of confidentiality 
 Page 25 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  and you have cultivated a trusting relationships with them (Harell, 1997; Winters et al., 1991, Wish et 
al., 1997).   Both of these necessary conditions will be in place. First, we will have a Certificate of 
Confidentiality in place, and will describe this to participants in the consent form. We expect that this will 
both minimize risk of any breach of confidentiality, and also ease any concerns that participants may 
have about the security of their data. Second, as we have followed this sample over approxim ately 10 
years, assessing –among other things - illicit behaviors such as substance use and other risk behaviors 
(e.g., delinquency), we are confident that a strong rapport has been established with these participants.  
15.2 Indicate how the research team is permitted to access any sources of information about the 
subjects.   
Response:  Participant information will be stored by [CONTACT_804334], and not by [CONTACT_804335]. The link between participant data and identifying information will be stored 
separately, in a “master list” that will be stored on a password -protected computer. The document itself 
also will have a password. Only project staff will have access to this information.  
16.0 Data Management  and Analysis  
16.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.  This section applies to 
both quantitative and qualitative analysis.  
Analytic Plan  
 
Aim 2: The goal of the Stage 2 open trial is to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention, as well as to 
generate suggestions for improving and refining it. To this end, the feedback obtained through the 
Stage 2 open trial and dyad interviews will be an alyzed primarily using qualitative data analysis. All 
qualitative d ata analysis will be transcript -based, using complete interview transcripts and observer 
notes as the original data sources. Given that our purpose is to make sense of participants’ feedbac k 
and suggestions for improving the intervention, content and thematic analysis will be used to analyze 
transcript data (see Braun & Clarke, 2006; Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). The dyad and not the individual 
will be the unit of analysis (Krueger & Casey, 2012). We will use Nvivo software (22.nvivo.com) for 
data analysis. At least two coders will read through the transcripts and develop and refine a series of 
codes through an iterative process. Disagreements will be resolved through team discussion and 
final code s to be entered into Nvivo as “nodes”. Node development will reflect the targeted areas of 
feedback and will organized around improving relevance and feasibility of the intervention (e.g., 
barriers, effects of alcohol, ease of implementation). Once entered , the Nvivo program will be used 
to sort and organize information chunks into thematic categories. Themes will be reviewed and 
discussed by [CONTACT_804336]. Using Nvivo, a series of 
headings will be generated, e ach corresponding to themes identified in the focus groups. We also 
will use Nvivo’s “query” function to search interview data to examine respondents’ reactions to 
content and feasibility domains of the FMI.  In Stage 2, we also will review quantitative summary data 
from self -report assessments (ratings of feasibility, acceptability) for consideration of continued 
modification.   
 
Aim 3:   
Data preparation . We will examine patterns of missing data, research dropout rates, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_804286], distributional properties of our measures, and correlations among 
outcome measures. Though we expect some missing data due to attrition, this will be mi nimal as we 
will be using rigorous participant retention procedures that have proven effective in our prior work. 
Importantly, our analytic approach (below) will allow us to include cases with missing data. Given the 
short follow -up and the  fact that we are focusing on close friend dyads, we expect minimal missing 
data. However, we will attempt to follow up with everyone, and in the case of one friend droppi[INVESTIGATOR_804287]. We will 
 Page 26 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  examine for FMI and control group differences on baseline measures and demographics, and if 
differences emerge, we will include the relevant variables as covariates in analysis.   
Treatment Feasibility and Fidelity.  Descriptive analyses of adherence data, refusal rates, follow -
up rates, and participant evaluations will be used to guide possible changes in the intervention and 
to provide information on feasibility and acceptability. Decisions about possible interventi on changes 
will be made with consideration of qualitative data (analysis described above) and investigator input.  
As noted, we will collect data on fidelity to ensure that the FMI was administered according to 
protocol a nd consistent with MI spi[INVESTIGATOR_17040].  
Outcome analyses . The primary goals of Aim 3 are to evaluate whether (1) FMI increases 
readiness, reduces perceived barriers, and increases alcohol knowledge and strategies post -
intervention and over the follow -up (2) FMI increases the implementation of friend -based assau lt-
protective behaviors (FAPB) in our 3 -month follow -up, and (3) changes in readiness, perceived 
barriers, alcohol knowledge and strategies are associated with implementation of FAPDs at 3 -month 
follow -up (potential mechanisms). We will also examine if qua lity of the dyad relationship changes as 
a function of the intervention. Increases would suggest strengthening of the relationship as a function 
of the intervention, and declines would indicate iatrogenic effects. Whether increases in 
implementation of beh avioral strategies are associated with reduced rates of sexual victimization will 
also be examined. Examination of sexual victimization is exploratory, as victimization rates are 
expected to be relatively low over the short follow -up period (i.e., approx. 30% across 3 months; 
Parks et al., 2008). In secondary analyses, parallel analyses will also be done with alcohol use as an 
outcome variable. Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_804288] R34 mechanism and the smaller sample size, we will 
focus analysis on effect sizes an d whether effects are in the proposed direction. Effect size 
estimates can be unreliable in small pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (Kraemer et al., 2006); thus, we will report effect 
sizes ranges (95% confidence bands).   
A prominent feature of our design is that individuals are nested within dyads, and this 
necessitates a data analytic approach that can accommodate nested data structures.  Hence, our 
Aim 3 analyses are built around hierarchical linear models (HLMs).  First , we will evaluate group 
differences on variables from our first post -intervention assessment (i.e. perceived barriers, 
readiness, alcohol knowledge and strategies, and implementation of FAPBs) using a two level model 
(individuals nested within dyads).  Tr eatment will be dummy coded (FMI vs. waitlist control group) 
and included as a level two covariate.  Second, we will utilize all data from our three month follow -
ups and repeat these analyses using a three -level model (6 repeated measures nested within 
individuals, and individuals nested within dyads).  In these models treatment will be included as a 
level three covariate.  We will use f2 to describe effect sizes (Cohen, 1988; Selya et al., 2012).  
Our burst design provides a rich opportunity to examine whether changes in target constructs of 
interest (e.g., barriers, skills, alcohol knowledge and strategies) are associated with implementation 
of FAPBs.  For these analyses we will combine the post -intervention data from our FMI and WLC 
groups after the latter has completed the intervention and follow -up assessments.  Combining 
groups will increase our sample size and provide more stable estimates of effect sizes. For these 
analyses we will include rep orts of past week protective behavioral strategies just prior to the 
intervention and weekly aggregates of protective behavioral strategies from our three -month follow -
up yielding [ADDRESS_1110112] sizes characterizing change will be computed in 
two ways: 1). Computing a difference score using basel ine and the first follow -up divided by [CONTACT_804337], and 2). A difference score using baseline and the last 
assessment of the follow -up divided by [CONTACT_804338] (Gibbons et al., 
1993; Morri s & DeShon, 2002). Individual level intercepts and slopes will be output from these 
growth models and this will allow us to examine correlations between slopes and intercepts.  We 
expect that reductions in perceived barriers (better self -efficacy, fewer in terpersonal concerns), and 
increases in readiness will be positively related to implementation of FAPBs. Our growth models will 
 Page 27 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  also allow us to include individual characteristics (e.g. assault history, drinking history, relationship, 
responsibility) to examine their association with change in perceived barriers, skill implementation, 
etc. (e.g., prior history of sexual assault is related to more or less change in variables our 
intervention is expected to impact).     
In exploratory analyses, we will examine whether increases in implementation of FAPB from 
baseline to follow -up are associated with rates of sexual victimization.  For these analyses we 
collapse our follow -up data into dichotomous variable indicating whether sexual victimization 
occurred.  Using a two -level HLM (individuals nested within dyads), this dichotomous outcome will 
be regressed on the intercepts and slopes from our growth models of FAPBs (described above). 
Steeper increases in FAPBs are expected t o be associated with lower likelihood of sexual 
victimization at follow -up controlling for baseline levels of sexual victimization.  Odds ratio will be 
used to describe the effect size. Data from stakeholder and exit interviews will be analyzed using 
qualitative data analytic techniques.  
16.[ADDRESS_1110113] “moderate” to “large” intervention effects.   
16.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected data.  
Response:  See above description of data management. In addition, we will follow procedures used in 
our lab previously for the assurance of quality online data. Specifically, we will review completion times 
and response patterns. Extremely brief (i.e., less than ½ o f estimated) completion times  for online 
surveys , or seemingly random response patterns (e.g., inconsistent or uniform responding) will prompt 
a reminder email to participants regarding study expectations.    
17.0 Confidentiality  
 
A. Confidentiality of Study Data  
 
Describe the local procedures for maintenance of confidentiality of study data and any 
records that will be reviewed for data collection .   
 
17.1 A.  Where and how will all data and records be stored?  Include information about:  
password protection, encryption, physical controls, authorization of access, and separation of 
identifiers and data, as applicable.  Include physical (e.g. paper) and electronic files.  
Response:   For in -person interview and self -report assessments, data will be stored on a computer 
in the UB Alcohol Research Lab, and backed -up regularly. The computer itself is password protected, 
and the lab in which the computer is kept is locked.  For online (electronic) data, detailed  procedures for 
protecting electronic data include the creation of random ID numbers which are later hooked into a 
“hash ID”. Thus, at no point are identifying information and participant data linked in cyberspace. We 
will further  safeguard against breaches of confidentiality by [CONTACT_804339][INVESTIGATOR_804289] (i.e., identifying information is stored in a separate electronic file with a separate password,  
accessible only to project staff ). Further, no individuals will be identified by [CONTACT_804340], seminars, professional presentations, or 
papers. Additionally, as we have done in the past, we will obtain a certificate of confidentiality from NIH 
in order to enhance the protection of the data, and to minimize concerns about reporting on illegal drug 
use.  
 Page 28 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  17.2 A.  How long will the data be stored?  
Response : Five years.  
17.[ADDRESS_1110114] access to the data?  
Response : Only study staff will have access to the data. At a later date, others may access the 
data for secondary data analysis. However, at this point, the data will be deidentified . 
17.4 A.  Who is responsible for receipt or transmission of the data?  
Response:  Drs. Read and Livingston  are primarily responsible for the receipt and transmission 
of the data. Staff personnel such as the graduate student and the project manager will also be 
involved in this task.  
17.5 A.  How will the data be transported?  
Response:  Electronically, via the internet. Please see description above.  
B. Confidentiality of Study Specimens  
Describe the local procedures for maintenance of confidentiality of study specimens .   
☒ N/A:  No specimens will be collected or analyzed in this research.   
(Skip to Section 19.0)  
 
18.[ADDRESS_1110115] to mandatory reporting 
guidelines. Related to this, staff also will be trained to identify any events that, though fa lling short of 
mandatory reporting requirements, may nonetheless warrant immediate clinical attention (e.g., recent 
sexual assault or assault -related distress, severe negative alcohol consequences). Any evidence that a 
participant may be in immediate and i dentifiable danger, or is experiencing other significant and acute 
distress (e.g., recent assault) will trigger an “emergency procedures” protocol  (see description below) . 
follow up interviews will have specific measures and interview questions that will serve as “flags” for our 
interventionists to assess for signs of distress. In cases where distress is indicated, interventionists and 
follow -up interviewers will have a proto col as to specific follow -up questions, and a link to referral 
resources. Finally, as we have done in previous work, our online assessments will have a “ REQUEST 
for CONTACT ” button.  Participants are instructed to click on this button if they are distressed and 
would like to talk to a member of the project staff. Clicking this will generate an e -mail to our staff, and 
[CONTACT_804354] (UB), who is a clinical psychologist, will conta ct the participant within [ADDRESS_1110116] events, and efficacy data.  
Response:  Please see response above.  
18.2 Describe any safety endpoints.  
Response:  As described above, safety endpoints involve identified distress or danger to a participant. It 
is important to note that our procedures are designed to balance reasonable measures to maintain 
participant safety, while at the same time not discouraging ac curate and truthful reporting on the part of 
participants. As described above, policies such as those involving the implementation of Title IX have 
been developed with this specific challenge in mind. Wanton reporting of every distressing event has 
 Page 29 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  the potential not only to have a deleterious effect on the study, but also can be iatrogenic for the 
participants themselves.  
18.3 Describe how the safety information will be collected (e.g., with case report forms, at study 
visits, by [CONTACT_10774]).  
Response : See above.   
18.4 Describe the frequency of safety data collection.  
Response : As is outlined in the description of our study approach above, we will collect data pre- and 
post-intervention, and then at follow -ups. Data will be reviewed for safety concerns at each data 
collection occasion.  
18.5 Describe who will review the safety data.  
Response:  Drs. Read and Livingston  and associated project staff (project manager, graduate student) 
will review the safety data. Requests for contact [CONTACT_804341]. Read, and she will oversee these 
procedures.  
18.6 Describe the frequency or periodicity of review of cumulative safety data.  
Response:  Safety reviews will be ongoing throughout the course of the study. Please see descriptions 
above.  
18.7 Describe the statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine whether harm is 
occurring.  
Response:  There are no statistical tests to determine safety.  
18.8 Describe any conditions that trigger an immediate suspension of the research.  
Response:  The research would be suspended if, in the highly, highly unlikely event, it was determined 
that the research was leading to immediate and identifiable distress or danger to participants.  
19.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
19.1 Describe anticipated circumstances under which subjects may be withdrawn from the 
research without their consent.  
Response:  A participant could be withdrawn without his or her consent in the event that it was 
determined that s/he was doing something purposefully to undermine the project. Such circumstances 
are hard to imagine, but might include mistreating project staff or oth er participants. This is not 
expected, both because such behavior is very unusual in study participants, and in [ADDRESS_1110117]. Read has never encountered an event so serious that it 
would call for termination of research participation. Still, it is possible, however unlikely . 
19.2 Describe any procedures for orderly termination.    
Response:   Participants would first be contact[CONTACT_804342], and efforts to resolve the problem 
would be made. The goal would always be to keep the participant enrolled in the study. If it were 
determined that this was not possible, the participant would be to ld of her or his removal, and 
compensated for any time that he/she had already put into the study. No future compensation would be 
offered, and no further contact [CONTACT_804343].  
19.3 Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, including 
retention of already collected data, and partial withdrawal from procedures with continued data 
collection, as applicable.  
 Page 30 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  Response : Participants can withdraw from the study at any time. If a participant withdraws, no efforts at 
future contact (e.g., follow -up assessments) would be initiated by [CONTACT_73573].  
20.[ADDRESS_1110118] the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or inconveniences to 
the subjects related to their participation in the research.  
Response:  Risks posed to participants in the present study are minimal. Evidence shows that 
assessments of sexual assault and related experiences may be conducted without serious deleterious 
psychological effects. Some participants may experience minor emotional di scomfort or embarrassment 
in responding to questions pertaining to potentially sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_804290], or even 
substance use. This could occur during completion of self -report assessments, or during individual 
interviews. However, such  discomfort is relatively rare, and is almost always mild and transient. Our 
labs have been conducting both in -person and online assessments of these phenomena for more than 
a decade and are well equipped to manage participant needs in the event that distr ess occurs (see 
below).  
As this dyad -based intervention focuses on motivating a sense of agency for action, through 
enhancement of personal responsibility and relationship between friends, another potential risk pertains 
to inadvertent, iatrogenic effects of the intervention. For  example, in cases where sexual victimization 
occurs to one of the dyad members – or even if it doesn’t - the other member of the dyad may believe 
that somehow she is to blame. We plan to assess such effects carefully, with an eye toward both (1) 
modificati on of the intervention to decrease such iatrogenic effects, and also (2) ensuring the wellness 
of the participants enrolled in our study. Efforts to address the first of these issues (future intervention 
modification) are described in the body of the propo sal. To address specific participant wellness 
concerns, here we outline several steps that we will take in the “Adequacy of Protection Against Risk” 
section, below.  
Lastly, because our study focuses on high -risk (i.e., heavy drinking) women, it is possible and 
perhaps even likely that women will experience some kind of event that falls along the spectrum of 
assault behaviors during the course of follow -up. Though this  assault would not be as a result of the 
intervention itself, it is a risk that our participants could incur during the period of follow -up and as such, 
is something that we have planned to address in our procedures. These procedures are described 
below.   
20.2 Describe procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks, including 
procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety.  
Response:  In an effort to prevent or minimize discomfort or embarrassment in responding to 
questions we will reiterate our procedures for protecting participant confidentiality in on -line 
questionnaires. Additionally, as a pre cautionary measure, all web  surveys will be accompanied b y a 
treatment referral list, as well as  by [CONTACT_804344] a mental 
health professional. Detailed procedures for protecting electronic data are described within the body of 
this proposal, and include the creation of random ID numbers which are later hooked into a “hash ID”. 
Thus, at no point are identifying information and participant data lin ked in cyberspace. We will  further  
safeguard against breaches of confidentiality by [CONTACT_804345][INVESTIGATOR_804291] (i.e., 
identifying information is stored in a separate electronic file with a separate password,  accessible only 
to project staff ). Further, no individuals will be identified by [CONTACT_804346], seminars, professional presentations, or papers. Additionally, 
as we have done in the past, we will obtain a certificate of confidentiality from NIH in order to enhance 
the protection of the data, and to minimize concerns about reporting on illegal drug use.  
First, as part of the intervention, we will explicitly discuss the ways in which a sense of 
responsibility to someone, is different from a sense of responsibility for someone, and that though there 
are ways in which friends may help one another to decrease sexual assault risk, this does not mean 
that they alone are responsible for one another’. Second, all participants will receive as part of the 
general study debriefi ng procedure, a description of possible iatrogenic intervention effects, including 
 Page 31 of 36 IRB Version: JAN2016  guilt and blame. Participants will be encouraged to discuss these concerns with interventionists at 
follow -up, with one of the two PIs, or to seek out additional support, available through our referral list. 
Third, as follow up interviews now have specific  measures and interview questions that will serve as 
“flags” for our interventionists to assess for signs of distress. In cases where distress is indicated, 
interventionists and follow -up interviewers will have a protocol as to specific follow -up questions , and a 
link to referral resources. Finally, as we have done in previous work, our online assessments will have a 
“REQUEST for CONTACT ” button.  Participants are instructed to click on this button if they are 
distressed and would like to talk to a member of the project staff. Clicking this will generate an e -mail to 
our staff, and [CONTACT_804354] (UB), who is a clinical psychologist, will conta ct the participant within two 
business days.  
Assessment and Management of Adverse Events.  Our procedures for managing adverse 
events are informed by [CONTACT_804347], alcohol -related outcomes, including [CONTACT_804354]’s training as a Clinical 
Psychologist an d her experience as the Director of the Clinical Psychology program, including the 
Psychological Services Clinic. All study staff, including interventionists and research assistants, will be 
trained to identify serious adverse events that may be subject to  mandatory reporting guidelines. 
Related to this, staff also will be trained to identify any events that, though falling short of mandatory 
reporting requirements, may nonetheless be warranting immediate clinical attention (e.g., recent sexual 
assault or a ssault -related distress). Any evidence that a participant may be in immediate and 
identifiable danger, or is experiencing other significant and acute distress (e.g., recent assault) will 
trigger an “emergency procedures” protocol. In these cases, the PI (D r. Read) will be notified by 
[CONTACT_804348]. In cases where this “triggering” occurs via online assessment, [CONTACT_804356] will make immediate phone contact [CONTACT_804349]. In cases where the triggering takes place during in -person assessments, [CONTACT_804354] will be 
contact[CONTACT_804350] (if [CONTACT_804354] is off -site) or in person  to 
provide further assessment and to formulate an action plan to ensure the participants safety and 
wellbeing . In the unlikely event that [CONTACT_804354] cannot be reached within the hour, either the Campus 
Psychological Services Center (PSC) or if outside of business hours, Campus Security will be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. In cases where the threat is determined not to be imminent, [CONTACT_804354] will work with the 
participants to connect them to services at either the PSC or the university -based Counseling Center. 
At both of these facilities, students may receive either free or r educed rate services. Drs. Read, 
Livingston, and Testa have close ties to these facilities. This will ensure a seemless pathway of care.  
Application of Title IX Reporting . In addition, we have carefully reviewed reporting 
requirements for Title IX, consulted with our UB Title IX representative ([CONTACT_804357] -Weiss,

may pertain to research (e.g., http://www.chronicle.com/article/Mandatory -Reporting -for-Title/141785 ;

it appears that, because mandatory reporting among researchers may act as a deterrent to research 
participation and thus may interfere with understanding of the very problem that such research is 
intended to address

er_Nov_5_2015docx.pdf ),  the reporting of assault events that may occur in the context of research 
such as the proposed project would not meet the standard of mandatory reporting as outlined by [CONTACT_804351] (Note that our research still would be subject to other mandatory reporting d emands, as described 
above). Still, guidelines around Title IX adherence change with time, and as such, we will continue to 
work closely with our Title IX officer to arrive at procedures that maintain the rights, confidentiality, and 
protections of our par ticipants, while still complying with reporting laws.  
 
Further, because “Best Practices” of Title IX procedures facilitate understanding on the part of 
students as to who may or may not be a mandated reporter, we will include in our informed consent a 
description of Title IX and its parameters. We will explici tly note that research reporting does not fall 
under mandated reporting guidelines, and will provide information for how to get in contact [CONTACT_804352].

☐ No (If no, Skip to Section 27.0)  
 
25.[ADDRESS_1110125].  Include steps to maximize subjects’ 
privacy . 
Response:  For the first study , consent will be obtained in person, when participants come in for their 
first session. For Study 1 participants, this will be the focus group. For Study 2 &3 , participants will 
consent online when they complete the self -report measures. For these studies, participants will be 
directed to an online consent form, which provides information about the study. Participants will consent 
by [CONTACT_18943] a button that reads, “I consent”. Participants who provide consent will then be directed to a 
series of questionnaires  online Qualtrics.com (see measures table for a complete list).   
 
25.3 Describe how you will ensure that subjects are provided with a sufficient period of time to 
consider taking part in the research study.   
Response : All participants will be scheduled for a lab visit. This will occur at least a week in advance, 
which should give them ample time to consider whether they wish to participate. Further, when 
participants are consented, they will be informed that there is no  pressure to consent, and that if they 
would like to take time to think it over, they can come in at another date to complete the consent and 
initial session.  
Describe any process to ensure ongoing consent, defined as a subject’s willingness to continue 
participation for the duration of the research study.   
Response:   There is no process for ongoing consent. The participant’s participation in the study is 
voluntary. As such, completion of the online surveys effectively functions as continued and ongoing 
consent.

Statistical Analysis Pla n  
Data preparation . We will examine patterns of missing data, research dropout rates, 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169373], distributional properties of our measures, and 
correlations among outcome measures. Though we expect some missing data due to attrition, 
this will be minimal given the short follow -up, the focus on close friend dyads, and employment 
of rigo rous participant retention procedures that have proven effective in our prior work. 
Importantly, our analytic approach (below) will allow us to include cases with missing data. In 
the case of one friend droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248], we will attempt to determine whether th e intervention 
played any role in study attrition. We will examine for FMI and control group differences on 
baseline measures and demographics, and if differences emerge, we will include the relevant 
variables as covariates in analysis.   
Treatment Feasibility and Fidelity.  Descriptive analyses of adherence data, refusal rates, 
follow -up rates, and participant evaluations will be used to guide possible changes in the 
intervention and to provide information on feasibility and acceptability. Decisions about possible 
interventi on changes will be made with consideration of qualitative data (analysis described 
above) and investigator input.  As noted, we will collect data on fidelity to ensure that the FMI 
was administered according to protocol a nd consistent with MI spi[INVESTIGATOR_17040].  
Outcome analyses . The primary goals of Aim 3 are to evaluate whether (1) FMI increases 
readiness and reduces perceived barriers to intervene, and increases alcohol knowledge and 
strategies post -intervention and over the follow -up (2) FMI increases the implementation of 
friend-based assault -protective behaviors (FAPB) in our 3 -month follow -up, and (3) changes in 
readiness and perceived barriers for protective behaviors, and alcohol knowledge and strategies 
are associated with implementation of FAPDs at 3 -month follow -up (potential mechanisms). We 
will also examine if quality of the dyad relationship changes as a function of the intervention. 
Increases or decreases in relationship quality as a function of the intervention would suggest 
either a positive impact  on dyadic relationships or iatrogenic effects of the intervention, 
respectively. Whether increases in implementation of behavioral strategies are associated with 
reduced rates of sexual victimization will also be examined. Examination of sexual victimizat ion 
is exploratory, as victimization rates are expected to be relatively low over the short follow -up 
period (i.e., approx. 30% across 3 months; Parks et al., 2008). In secondary analyses, we will 
also consider alcohol use as an outcome variable to examine  potential intervention effects on 
drinking. Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_804288] R34 mechanism and the smaller sample size, we will 
focus analysis on effect sizes and whether effects are in the proposed direction. Effect size 
estimates can be unreliable in small  pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (Kraemer et al., 2006); thus, we will report 
effect sizes ranges (95% confidence bands).   
A prominent feature of our design is that individuals are nested within dyads, and this 
necessitates a data analytic approach that can accommodate nested data structures.  Hence, 
our Aim 3 analyses are built around hierarchical linear models (HLMs).  First , we will evaluate 
group differences on variables from our first post -intervention assessment (i.e. perceived 
barriers, readiness, alcohol knowledge and strategies, and implementation of FAPBs) using a 
two level model (individuals nested within dyads).  Tr eatment will be dummy coded (FMI vs. 
waitlist control group) and included as a level two covariate.  Second, we will utilize all data from 
our three month follow -ups and repeat these analyses using a three -level model (6 repeated 
measures nested within ind ividuals, and individuals nested within dyads).  In these models 
treatment will be included as a level three covariate.  We will use f2 to describe effect sizes 
(Cohen, 1988; Selya et al., 2012).  
 Our burst design provides a rich opportunity to examine whether changes in target 
constructs of interest (e.g., barriers, skills, alcohol knowledge and strategies) are associated 
with implementation of FAPBs.  For these analyses we will combine the post -intervention data 
from our FMI and WLC groups after the latter has completed the intervention and follow -up 
assessments.  Combining groups will increase our sample size and provide more stable 
estimates of effect sizes. For these analyses we will include re ports of past week protective 
behavioral strategies just prior to the intervention and weekly aggregates of variables of interest 
from our three -month follow -up yielding [ADDRESS_1110129] sizes characterizing change will be computed in two ways: 1). 
Computing a difference score using baseline and the first follow -up divided by [CONTACT_804353], and 2). A difference score using baseline and the last 
assessment of the follow -up divided by [CONTACT_804338] (Gibbons 
et al., 1993; Morris & DeShon, 2002). Individual leve l intercepts and slopes will be output from 
these models and this will allow us to examine correlations between slopes and intercepts.  We 
expect that reductions in perceived barriers (better self -efficacy, fewer interpersonal concerns), 
and increases in readiness will be positively related to implementation of FAPBs. Our models 
will also allow us to include individual characteristics (e.g. assault histo ry, drinking history, 
relationship, responsibility) to examine their association with change in perceived  barriers, skill 
implementation, etc. (e.g., prior history of sexual assault is related to more or less change in 
variables our intervention is expected to impact).     
In exploratory analyses, we will examine whether increases in implementation of 
FAPB from baseline to follow -up are associated with rates of sexual victimization.  For 
these analyses we collapse our follow -up data into dichotomous variable indicating 
whether sexual victimization occurred.  Using a two -level HLM (individuals nested within 
dyads), this dichotomous outcome will be regressed on the intercepts and slopes of 
FAPBs (described above). Steeper increases in FAPBs are expected to be associated 
with lo wer likelihood of sexual victimization at follow -up controlling for baseline levels of 
sexual victimization.  Odds ratio will be used to describe the effect size. Data from 
stakeholder and exit interviews will be analyzed using qualitative data analytic 
techniques.

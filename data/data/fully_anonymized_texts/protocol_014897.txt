Title : A Multicenter, Multinational, Randomized, Active -Controlled 
Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous 
Ferric Carboxymaltose in Pediatric Patients with Iron 
Deficiency Anemia   
Study Drug:   Ferric carboxymaltose (Injectafer®) 
    Oral Iron ( Ferrous sulfate) 
Objective:  The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and 
safety of intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) , compared 
to oral iron , in pediatric participant s who have iron deficiency anemia 
(IDA). 
Design:  This is a Phase III, multicenter,  multinational, randomized, active -
controlled study that compares the efficacy and safety of FCM to oral 
iron in pediatric participants  with IDA  and a documented history of 
an inadequate response  to oral iron  therapy  at least 8 weeks (56 days)  
prior to randomization .   
 Participants who satisfy the inclusion requirements and no exclusion 
criteria will be eligible to participate in this study  and enter into a 
screening phase to confirm eligibility.  Randomization will occur via 
the Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) system  in a 1:1 ratio to 
either Group A, participants receiving FCM , or Group B , participants 
receiv ing oral iron ( oral solution  drops , elixir or oral tablets). 
Randomization  will be stratified by [CONTACT_603198] ( <10, ≥10 g/dL)  
and age (1 to <12 years and ≥12 to 17 years).   
 The oral ferrous sulfate formulation received will be based on the 
participant’s age, such that infants and children  (1 to <4 years of age) 
will receive ferrous sulfate drops , children ( ≥4 to <12 years of ag e) 
will have the option to receive ferrous sulfate elixir  or ferrous sulfate 
tablets , and adolescents ( ≥12 to 17 years of age) will receive ferrous 
sulfate tablets.  Participants who experience adverse clinical 
symptoms due to the oral iron during the treatment  phase may have 
a weight -based dose  of ferrous sulfate reduced from 6 mg/kg to 3 
mg/kg . If the participant is receiving tablets, the dose will be reduced 
from one tablet taken twice daily to one tablet per day.   
 Once randomized , all participants will return for efficacy and safety 
evaluations, including adverse events and laboratory assessments, on 
Days 7, 14, 28 , and 35.  Additional pharmacokinetic sampling and 
analyses will be performed for participants receiving FCM on Days 
0 and 7.

1.1 Treatment  of Iron Deficiency  Anemia  
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) remains the most common nutritional deficiency in children 
in the [LOCATION_002]  (US).[ADDRESS_798707] administration and can restore iron deficit in the 
patient. Previous  studies with parenteral iron sucrose (Venofer®) have be en performed in 
the pediatric population .7-[ADDRESS_798708] varied in the se studies , and the data 
demonstrates the e fficacy and safety of Venofer® in doses up to 7  mg iron/kg (or 200  mg) 
administered over 3 min utes, which was shown to be beneficial to both the child and health 
care facility .7 
FCM has been characterized as a n iron complex (Type 1) with a molecular mass of about 
150,000 Daltons (Da). The solution is a dark brown color with a near neutral pH (5.0 to 7.0) 
and a physiological osmolarity permitting administration of higher single doses in short 
time periods. Althou gh no randomized interventional studies have been conducted with 
FCM  in the pediatric population to date, the product has been used successfully  to address  
iron deficiency in pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn ’s disease . A non-

Page 14 of 93 interventio nal, retrospective observational data collection reported FCM exposure i n 79 
patients aged 2 to 18 years with a mean age of 12.7 years.  In these patients , FCM  was found 
to be safe, well -tolerated, and effective in increasing hemoglobin, ferritin, and TSAT .18 
The proposed stud y will provide safety and efficacy  data o n the use of FCM  in pediatric 
patients (aged between 1 and 17 years) with IDA. FCM will be administered in 2 doses at 
15 mg/kg maximum single dose of 750 mg with a total maximum cumulative dose of 1500 
mg.  The ability to infuse higher doses  of elemental iron should  permit repletion in fewer 
overall infusions , and in doing so may ultimately permit fewer visits to the treating facilities . 
1.2 Ferric Carboxymaltose  
1.2.1  Key features of Ferric Carb oxymaltose  
FCM  injection is a stable , non -dextran,  Type I polynuclear iron  (III)-hydroxide 
carbohydrate complex developed as an IV iron replacement therapy for the treatment of 
IDA.  After IV administration, FCM  is mainly found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.  
The iron slowly dissociates from the complex and can be efficiently used in the bone 
marrow for hemoglobin synthesis.  The carbohydrate moiety of FCM  is metabolized by [CONTACT_603199].   
1.2.[ADDRESS_798709] available in the US, has been associated with 
an incidence of anaphylaxis/anap hylactoid reactions (i.e., dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, 
urticaria, angioedema) as high as 1.7% .[ADDRESS_798710] been 
attributed to the use of IV iron dextran .17   The high incidence of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid 
reactions is bel ieved to be caused by [CONTACT_603200].  
Although some have suggested that high molecular weight (HMW) iron dextran is 
associated with a higher rate of life threatening adverse events and anaphylactic reactions 
in compariso n to low molecular weight (LMW) iron dextran, the US Food and Drug 
Administration was unable to find a clear difference after an examination of post -marketing 
data, clinical trial data, death certificates, and emergency room diagnoses .[ADDRESS_798711] significant dosage 
and administration rate limitations.  If the body’s ability to sequester, store, and transport 
infused iron is overwhelmed, a reaction to excess free iron in circulation, referred to as a 
bioactive iron reaction , may occur .  Iron sucrose  and iron gluconate  preparations carry a 
significant risk of inducing a bioactive i ron reaction  when delivered  at higher doses. These 
reactions are characterized by [CONTACT_27913] (without allergic signs) accompanied by [CONTACT_603201], abdomen, flank and/o r nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.19

Page 15 of 93 Due to its structure, FCM  is more stable than iron gluconate and iron sucrose, and this 
results in  a slow er delivery of the complexed iron to endogenous iron binding sites .  FCM 
has an acute toxicity in animals approximately 1/[ADDRESS_798712] 8 weeks (56 days) prior 
to randomization .   
Participants who satisfy the inclusion requirements and no exclusionary criteria will be 
eligible to participate in this study  and enter into a screening phase to confirm eligibility. 
Randomization will occur via the IRT system  in a 1:1 ratio to either Group A, participants 
receiving FCM , or Group B, participants receiving o ral iron (oral  solution  drops , elixir or 
oral tablets) up to Day 28. Randomization  will be stratified by [CONTACT_244097]  (<10, 
≥10 g/dL)  and age (1 to <12 and ≥12 to 17 years).   
The oral ferrous sulfate formulation received will be based on the participant’s age, such 
that: infants and children  (1 to <4 years of age) will receive ferrous sulfate drops , children 
(≥4 to <12 years o f age) will have the option to receive ferrous sulfate elixir  or ferrous 
sulfate tablets , and adolescents ( ≥12 to 17 years of age) will receive ferrous sulfate tablets.  
Participants who experience adverse clinical  symptoms due to the oral iron during the 
treatment  phase may have the weight -based dose  of ferrous sulfate reduced from 6 mg/kg 
to 3 mg/kg . If the participant is receiving tablets, the dose will be reduced from one tablet 
taken twice daily to one tablet per day.  
Once randomized , all participants w ill return for efficacy and safety evaluations, including 
adverse events and laboratory assessments, on Days 7, 14, 28 , and 35.  Additional 
pharmacokinetic sampling and analyses will be performed for participants receiving FCM 
on Days 0 and 7.  
3.2 Rationale  of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups  
Oral ferrous sulfate was selected as the active comparator because in addition to tablets, 
liquid formulations suitable for administration to pediatric pa rticipants  in different age 
American Regent , Inc.   Protocol No.: 1VIT17044  
CONFIDENTIAL   Administrative Change 1 Date:  Final [ADDRESS_798713] widely prescribed oral iron preparation for 
use in the treatment of pediatric IDA , relative to other preparations , according to a survey 
of pediatric hematology/oncology specialists .11 Ferrous sulfate drops, (15 mg  elemental 
iron/mL), may be used as an iron supplement for infants and children  up to 4 years of age, 
per manufacturer labeling .15 Oral ferrous sulfate elixir  will be provided as an alternative  
preparation  to oral tablets in order to ameliorate the difficu lty of swallowing tablets with 
children. Per the recommended total daily dose of oral elemental iron for the treatment of 
IDA in pediatric patients ranges between 3 -6 mg/kg/day divided into one to three doses, a 
total daily dose of 6 mg/kg/day divided into  2 doses  (maximum daily dose of 130 mg of 
elemental iron)  was selected for all ages based on the most common practice of pediatric 
hematology physicians in the [LOCATION_002] .[ADDRESS_798714] to FCM , doses of 15 mg/kg with a maximum of [ADDRESS_798715] been 
selected based off evidence generated from American Regent ’s Phase II dose -finding 
PK/PD study in which cohorts received single, weight -based doses of FCM at either 7.5 
mg/kg or 15 mg/kg .16 Results from this study demonstrate that the higher weight -based dose 
is both efficacious and safe . The mean increase from baseline to Day 35 was larger for 
partici pants in Cohort 2 receiving 15 mg/kg (2.8  ± 1.15 g/dL) than those in Cohort 1 
receiving 7.5 mg/kg (1.9  ± 1.38 g/dL ). The mean increase in ferritin and TSAT at Day 35 
was 35.1  ± 98.22 ng/mL and 9.9  ± 11.54% , respectively, for Cohort 1 (N=16) and 52.4  ± 
31.7 ng/mL and 13.5  ± 6.88% , respectively,  for Cohort 2 (N=18) , respectively .  (Table 1 )

populations.14  Lastly, a retrospective cohort study of 72 pediatric patients with IDA 
refractory to  oral iron treatment ranging in age from 9 months to 18 years treated with 15 
mg/kg of FCM (maximum single dose of 750 mg; median dose 750 mg) supports this 
dosing.12 
3.3 Rationale for Sparse Pharmacokinetic Sampling : 
Population -based PK/PD modelling describing the time course of total serum iron (TSI) 
concentrations and the relatio nship between TSI and changes of  hemoglobin following a 
single dose of intravenous FCM in pediatric subjects with IDA has been performed using 
intensively sampled data from Study 1VIT13036.16  It is proposed to supplement this initial 
modelling with additional sparsely sampled PK data from this study . Based on the 
anticipated visit duration on the 2 FCM administration  days in this study, the following 
sparse PK sampling schem e is proposed: pre -dose, immediately (within 5 minutes)  post-
infusion and [ADDRESS_798718] -dose on Days 0 and 7, on which subjects will receive 15 mg/kg 
(up to a maximum dose of 750 mg).  This pragmatic approach, which minimizes the number 
of blood draws compared to a full PK profile, is expected to facilitate exposure -response 
analysis for the proposed FCM regimen .

CONFIDENTIAL   Administrative Change 1 Date:  Final [ADDRESS_798720] given written informed consent/assent with a 
diagnosis of IDA who fulfill the inclusion criteria  and do not meet any of the exclusion 
criteria  will be randomized to receive either FCM or Oral Iron.  
4.[ADDRESS_798721] who enters the screening phase  will be assigned, via the IRT system, a unique 
screening number. From the time of consent until the start of treatment with study drug , the 
participant will not receive any form of supplemental iron outside of the study (intravenous 
or blood transfusion iron from 4 weeks prior to consent or oral iron including multivitamins 
with iron from time of consent).  Dietary iron intake will not be res tricted during 
participation in the study.  
If the participant does not qualify for study entry , the participant should be entered into the 
IRT system as a screen failure.  Participants can be r e-screened once (See section 6. 2).

4.3 Participant Assignment and Randomization Process  
Participants who satisfy the inclusion requirements and no exclusionary criteria will be 
eligible to participate in this study  and entered into the IRT system . Randomization will 
occur in a 1:1 ratio to either Group A, participants receiving FCM , or Group B, participants 
receiving o ral iron (oral  solution  drops , elixir or oral tablets). Randomization  will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_244097] (<10, ≥10 g/dL) and age (1 to <12 a nd ≥12 to 17 years).   
The oral ferrous sulfate formulation received will be based on the participant’s age, such 
that: infants  and children  (1 to <4 years of age) will receive ferrous sulfate drops , children 
(≥4 to <12 years of age) will receive ferrous sulfate elixir  or ferrous sulfate tablets , and 
adolescents ( ≥12 to 17 years of age) will receive ferrous sulfate tablets.  Participants who 
experience adverse clinical  symptoms due to the oral iron during the treatment  phase may 
have their weight -based dose  of ferrous sulfate reduced from 6 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg . If the 
participant is receiving tablets, the dose will be reduced from one tablet taken twice daily 
to one tablet per day.  
4.[ADDRESS_798724] to discontinue study drug , but wish to remain in the study for follow -
up. In those situations, patients will be asked to continue the normal clinical trial schedule 
for ascertainment of safety events . 
4.6 Concomitant Intervention  
Concomitant intervention  is defined as follows:  
 Blood transfusion.  
 Use of IV or oral  iron outside of protocol.  
 Increase in erythropoietin for any reason (Day  0 thru Day 35).

 The participant will be evaluated clinically prior to drug administration to assess 
the development of clinically -significant conditions.   
 The vials will be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration 
before use.  If noted, the vial will not be used , and the Investigator or his designee 
will notify the sponsor or sponsor’s designee for replacement of the study drug , 
and for direction on the return of the unused vial.  
 Heart rate and blood p ressure will be assessed pre -, immediately (within 5 
minutes) post, and [ADDRESS_798727] administration .  Participants will be 
discharged from the site by [CONTACT_603204] 30 minutes after the administration is 
completed . 
 The participant will be monitored for at least 30 minutes for serious acute 
reactions as hypersensitivity or bioactive ( labile ) iron reactions to non -dextran 
IV iron prod ucts have rarely been reported. The re actions include: hypotension, 
loss of consciousness, bronchospasm with dyspnea, shortness of breath, and 
seizures.  
o In the event a serious acute reaction is seen, the site must have the 
capability to provide appro priate resuscitation measures. These may 
include IV NS, IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], steroids, and/or antihistamines.  
5.4 Drug Accountability  
Investigators will keep records of the receipt, administration and return of the study drug  
(FCM  and ferrous sulfate ).  They will not allow the study drug to be used for purposes other 
than as directed by [CONTACT_3181].  The investigator agrees that he/she will not supply study 
medication to any persons other than those  enrolled  in the study , or to investigators not 
listed on the FDA 1572.  When the study is completed, or if it is prematurely terminated, a 
final inventory of all clinical supplies must be compi[INVESTIGATOR_603192] , Inc., or destroyed on site , per the site’s 
documented locally accepted policies.  All data regarding the study drug must be recorded 
as per the Monitoring Plan.

For any laboratory abnormality, the investigator will make a judgment as to its clinical 
significance. If the laboratory value is outside the normal limits and is felt to represent a 
clinically significant worsening from the baseline value, it should be considered an adverse 
event and should  be recorded on the Adverse Events  page of the eCRF. If the laboratory 
value is outside the normal range, but not an adverse event, the investigator should comment 
on the findings (i.e. , “not clinically significant” or “unchanged from baseline”) in the sou rce 
documentation [laboratory report]. All laboratory values at the end of study/Day [ADDRESS_798740] been deemed clinical significant by [CONTACT_603206].

through the completion of the study Day 35. A dverse events will be captured [ADDRESS_798742] dose of study drug for participant s who receive study drug and terminate early from 
the trial. This can be completed via a phone call. All ongoing AE’s  relate d to study drug 
(FCM or ferrous sulfate) should be followed until they are no longer related, have taken a 
confounding medication or return to baseline grade  
Relationship (Causality) : The Investigator will be asked to document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_603194]*  as follows:  
 NONE   There is no evidence of any causal relationship.

CONFIDENTIAL   Administrative Change 1 Date:  Final 26 September 2019  
Page 30 of 93  UNLIKELY  There is little evidence to suggest there is a causal relationship. 
There is another reasonable explanation  for the event (e.g., the 
particip ant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
  POSSIBLE  There is some  evidence to suggest a causal relationship (i.e. , there 
is a reasonable  possibility that the adverse experience may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_416714]).  However, the influence of other factors 
may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical  
condition , other concomitant events).  
 PROBABLE  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence 
of other factors is unlikely . 
 
* For the purposes of this  trial, “study drug” is defined as:      
 
FCM  
 
OR 
 
Ferrous Sulfate  
7.2 Reporting of Adverse Events  
Adverse experiences will be elicited by [CONTACT_416715] “Have you noticed 
any problems?”  Participant s will be encouraged to report adverse events at their onset.   
Any adverse experience spontaneously reported by, elicited from the participant , or 
observed by [CONTACT_5983] , shall be recorded on the appropriate Adverse Event 
page of the eCR F. The investigator will record the date and time of onset, severity, the 
relationship to study medication, the date and time of resolution (or the fact that the event 
is still continuing), the action taken, and the outcome of the adverse experience on the  
Adverse Event page of the eCRF. Whenever possible, the investigator should group 
together, into a single term, signs and symptoms which constitute a single diagnosis. For 
example, cough, rhinitis and sneezing might be grouped together as "upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y 
infection."  
7.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Definition : An adverse event is classified as SERIOUS if it meets any one of the following 
criteria:  
 Death  
 Life-Threatening:  The participant was at substantial risk of dying at the time of the 
adverse event or it is suspected that the use or continued use of the product would 
result in the participant's death.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged):  Required admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541480] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].

CONFIDENTIAL   Administrative Change 1 Date:  Final 26 September 2019  
Page 31 of 93  Disability:  Resulted in a significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, 
damage or disruption in the participant’s body function/structure, physical activities 
or quality of  life. 
 Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect . 
 Important medical events: Other medically important events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8574], may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
A dis tinction should be drawn between SAE and severe AE.  A SAE is a major experience 
of its type.  A SAE is not necessarily serious: e.g. nausea, which persists for several hours, 
may be considered severe nausea, but it is not an SAE.  On the other hand a stro ke, which 
results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke, but would be 
a SAE.  
Timing:  All SAEs will be reported from the day of initial treatment with *study drug  
through the completion of the study Day 35.  S erious adverse events will be captured [ADDRESS_798743] dose of study drug  for participant s who are randomized and terminate 
early from the trial. This can be completed via a phone call. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541481]

prior to treatment with study drug) that ha s not increased in severity or led to prolongation 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541482] a SAE. All reported SAE  should be followed until 
they are no longer serious or return to baseline grade.   
Reporting:  Any SAE, starting with the first dose of study drug, that is to be reported (as 
outlined in Timing section above) must be reported immediately ( within 24 hours of  
learning of the event ) to American Regent , Inc. by [CONTACT_756], email and/or fax of the 
written SAE report form to the contacts listed below:

Email: pv@americanregent .com  
 
The local investigator is responsible for reporting SAEs to their local IRB/ Ethics 
Committee based on local reporting guidelines (which may be different than those specified 
in this protocol) . The responsible investigator should institute appropriate diag nostic and 
therapeutic measures and keep the participant under observation for as long as is medically 
indicated.

(e.g., coefficient of variation) may be reported when appropri ate. Categorical variables will 
be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.   
Generally, data will be summarized by [CONTACT_474306].  However, data from both unscheduled 
and scheduled will be used for determination of last observed value, and in wo rst- or best -
case changes and/or shifts from baseline. Assessment windows will not be defined for the 
purpose of classifying measurements obtained outside scheduled assessment times.  
A complete description of the statistical analyses and methods will be av ailable in a 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized before the database is locked.  
8.1 Stratification/Randomization  
Participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized on Day 0 to FCM 
or oral iron in a 1:1  ratio. The  randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_33308] (<10, ≥10 
g/dL ) and age (1 to <12 and ≥12 to 17 years) .  
8.2 Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat Population  
The Intent -to-Treat ( ITT) population will comprise all randomized participants. Participants 
will b e evaluated according to the treatment to which they were randomized. Any 
participant who receives a treatment randomization number will be considered to have been 
randomized.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat Population  
The modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) populati on will comprise all participated in the ITT 
population who receive at least one dose of study drug, have a baseline hemoglobin 
measurement, and at least one corresponding post -baseline measurement.  Participants will 
be evaluated according to the treatmen t to which they were randomized.  The primary 
population for the assessing efficacy will be the mITT population.  
Safety Population  
The safety population will consist of all participants in the ITT population who received at 
least one dose of study drug.  P articipants will be evaluated according to treatment received.  
This population will be used for assessing safety.  
Pharmacokinetics Population  
The Pharmacokinetics (PK) population will consist of all participants in the Safety 
population with at least one measurable concentration of FCM.

The number of participants in each investigative site  will be summarized .  The number of 
participants who are screened, randomized, treated, prematurely discontinue, and complete  
the study will be summarized.     
The clinical team will identify deviations and the deviations will be identified in the 
database.  Participants with clinically important protocol deviations will be summarized.  
Demographics and b aseline characteristics wi ll be summarized using descriptive statistics 
or frequency counts.  
8.4 Endpoints and Definitions  
8.4.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the change in hemoglobin from baseline to day 35 .  The change in 
hemoglobin from baseline to day 35 will be analyzed using parametric analysis of 
covariance  (ANCOVA).  The model will include terms for the randomization strata 
(hemoglobin  and age  categories), baseline hemoglobin , as well as treatment group.  Baseline 
hemoglobin will be defined as the last hemoglob in obtained before randomization.  
The primary endpoint will be analyzed for the mITT population.  
Subgroup analyses  
The change in hemoglobin from baseline to day 35 will be summarized separately for the 
following subgroups:  
 Cause of IDA : IBD , not IBD     
 CKD, not CKD  
 Baseline hemoglobin : <10,  ≥10 g/dL   
 Age:  1 to <12,  ≥[ADDRESS_798746] together with 95% confidence intervals will be displayed 
graphically.  
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the mITT population.  
8.4.2 Seco ndary Endpoint s 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include:  
 Change in ferritin from baseline to Day 35  
 Change in TSAT from baseline to Day 35  
 Changes from baseline to in hemoglobin, ferritin, TSAT, and reticulocyte 
hemoglobin content.  
 Pharmacokinetic assessment s, including C max, Tmax, AUC 0-time last measured concentration , 
AUC 0-infinity , T1/2, MRT, Cl, V D, VDc, VDss, and V Darea. These assessments will be

Page 34 of 93 based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from this study and 
1VIT13036 . 
Continuous efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using ANCOVA as described for the 
primary endpoint. Binary efficacy variables will be analyzed using stratified Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel chi -square tests . 
All secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed for the mITT population.  
Details of analyses for these endpoints will be outlined in the SAP.   
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) Endpoints  
The PK  parameters will be calculated by [CONTACT_364397] -compartmental analysis according 
to current working practices and using WinNonlin®. All calculations of non -
compartmental parameters will be based on actual sampling times. The actual sampling 
times and doses will be used for the analysis.  The PK parameters will be calculated with 
and without adjustment for baseline. All derived PK parameters will be listed. T he 
following summary statistics will be calculated: n, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
coefficient of v ariation (CV) , median, minimum, and maximum, along with geometric 
mean, geometric mean SD, geometric percent coefficient of variation [%CV], and 95% 
CIs around the geometric mean. For Tmax, only n, median, minimum and maximum will be 
presented.  
In additi on, nonlinear mixed effects modelling will be used derive population PK parameters and/or 
models. The influence of various covariates (e.g., age, weight, sex, race) on the variability will be 
examined. Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
The relat ionship between FCM exposure and clinical outcome may be explored graphically. If 
appropriate, a relationship may be established between FCM exposure and effect or any special 
interest adverse events. Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
8.4.3 Miss ing Data  
A participant who withdraws from the study for any reason will be included in the analyses 
regardless of time on study. Methods for handling withdrawals and missing data will be 
specific to each endpoint to be analyzed. Details will be provided in  the SAP.  
8.5 Analyses of Safety  
8.5.1 Study Drug Exposure  
For FCM, the number of infusions and total administered amount of iron will be 
summarized descriptively. For oral iron, the total amount of iron will be summarized 
descriptively.  
8.5.2 Adverse Even ts 
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Med DRA ) dictionary .  
American Regent , Inc.   Protocol No.: 1VIT17044  
CONFIDENTIAL   Administrative Change 1 Date:  Final 26 September 2019  
Page 35 of 93 The number and percent of participants who report TEAE will be summarized for each 
treatment group. A TEAE  is an event with onset date on or after the study drug start date.   
Adverse event summaries will exclude preferred terms that describe asymptomatic serum 
ferritin, TSAT , and reticulocyte values (or change s). This approach is justified by [CONTACT_541502] -defined 
reporting standards for hemoglobin/hematocrit and low iron indices.  For the purposes of 
this study, non -serious anemia (hemog lobin or hematocrit below the normal range or 
worsened from baseline) or iron deficiency (iron indices below the normal range or 
worsened from baseline) will not be considered adverse events.  Anemia or iron deficiency 
will be considered end points if an i ntervention is required.  
The adverse event profile will be characterized with severity (as graded by  [CONTACT_4681] [NCI -CTCAE]) and 
relationship (unrelated and related) to study drug. Related adverse events will be events that 
are possibly or probably related to treatment in the investigator’s judgment.  
Participants who report the same preferred term on multiple occasions will be counted once 
for the preferred term: under the highest severity when summarized by [CONTACT_603207]. If a participant 
reports multiple preferred terms for a SOC , the subject will be counted only once for that 
SOC.   
The number and percent of parti cipants who report treatment -emergent serious adverse 
events will be similarly summarized for each treatment group. The number and percent of 
participants who report treatment -emergent adverse events resulting in discontinuation of 
study drug will be simil arly summarized for each treatment group.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_798747]  
Adverse events (AEs) of special interest include hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity -like 
reactions, and cardiovascular events. Hypersensitivity and hypersensitivity -like rea ctions 
will be identified using standardized MedDRA queries. Cardiovascular events will be 
identified using the SOCs for cardiac disorders and vascular disorders.  
The overviews and summaries that are provided for all TEAEs will also be provided for the 
AEs of special interest . In addition, the time to onset and time to recovery will be 
summarized.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_798748] -
baseline value is abnormal (i.e ., meets Grade  III or Grade IV toxicity criteria from the NCI -
CTC  Version 5 or higher ).  Baseline will be defined as the last value obtained before 
randomization.

8.5.5 Vital Signs  
For the FCM group, the change in vital signs  (including sitting heart rate and blood pressure)  
from pre -infusion to each post -infusion time point will be summarized descriptively on each 
dosing day.  
8.6 Sample Size Rationale  
A total of 60 participants (30 per treatment group) ar e required to detect an expected 
difference in hemoglobin  of 1.0 g/dL (common standard deviation = 1. 16 g/dL) at two -sided

DESIGN  
 
 
 
 
 
  The study design has been modified to eliminate the prospective 14 day oral 
iron run -in phase and randomization based on response  to the run -in phase and 
replaced with participants requiring  a documented history of an insufficient 
response to oral iron therapy over a longer time period (8 weeks ) as suggested .  
 A reduced regimen for Cohort B was modified from  the proposed  one dose per 
day to a dose reduction to 3 mg/kg for participants that experience adverse 
events.  
 Cohort B age groups cutoffs were modified to 1 to <4 years of age and ≥4 to 
<12 years of age for those receiving ferrous sulfate drops and elixir , 
respective ly. 
 Sparse PK sampling on Day 0 and Day 7 for FCM only participants.  
 
Original W ording : 
This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, active -controlled study that compares 
the efficacy and safety of FCM to oral iron in pediatric participants with IDA who 
have had an inadequate response after a 14 -day oral iron run -in period.    
Participants who satisfy the inclusion requirements and no exclusionary criteria will 
be eligible to participate in this study. All appropriate participants will enter a 14 -
day oral iron run -in period.  The oral ferrous sulfate formulation received will be 
based on the participant’s age, such that: infants and toddlers (1 to <5 years of age) 
will receive ferrous sulfate drops, children ( ≥5 to <12 years of age) will receive 
ferrous sulf ate elixir, and adolescents (≥12 to 17 years of age) will receive ferrous 
sulfate tablets.  The dose reduction is 
still within the 
recommended range of 
3-6 mg/kg for iron 
supplementation and 
will mitigate expected 
tolerance and/or 
adhe rence  issues . 
The cutoffs reflect the 
age group specified in 
the oral iron drops 
supplement label and 
traditional age range for 
infants  (1 to 3 years 
old). 
Sparse PK sampling 
included to facilitate

treatment responders and will not be randomized.   
Participants who have an unsatisfactory response to oral iron (as defined by [CONTACT_603216] <1 g/dL from baseline despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] ≥ 67% compliance based on 
tablet/drop s/elixir count) will be defined as non -responders  to oral iron 
treatment.  Non -responders who continue to meet inclusion criteria (including 
Hgb <12 g/dL) and no exclusion criteria will be stratified by [CONTACT_603198] (<10, 
≥10 g/dL) and age (1 to <12 and ≥1 2 to 17 years).   Randomization will occur in a 
1:1 ratio to either Group A, participants receiving FCM (oral iron product from the 
run in phase will be discontinued), or Group B, participants continuing  to receive 
oral iron (oral solution drops, elixir or oral tablets) up to Day 14.   
Participants who had  a Hgb value increase <1 g/dL from baseline in the run -in 
period BUT less than 67% compliance will not be randomized.  
Participants who experience other symptoms due to the oral iron during the run-in 
phase will have their twice -daily dose regimen  of ferrous sulfate reduced to one 
dose per day.  Participants that demonstrate a ≥1 g/dL increase in Hgb in 
response to once daily oral iron therapy during the run -in phase, or those that 
experience ongoing adverse clinical symptoms after a reduction to on ce daily 
oral iron therapy will not be randomized.  Participants receiving once -daily oral 
iron that do not experience a ≥1 g/dL increase in Hgb after the 14 day run -in 
phase (despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] ≥67% compliance with the reduced dose schedule) will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_603217] b and age, and then randomized in the same 1:1 ratio to either

INCLUSION CRITERIA  & 
SECTION 4.2.1 OF 
PARTIPANT SELECTION  Additional diagnostic parameters  were included to support  the diagnosis of iron 
deficiency anemia and the unsatisfactory response was changed from prospective to 
retrospective. No point of care testing will be perfor med.  
Original Wording : 
2. Screening Transferrin Saturation ( TSAT) <20%.  
4. Randomization Hgb 12 g/dL  (based on the average point of care Hgb performed 
on Screening and Day 0).  
5. Participants must demonstrate an unsatisfactory response to oral iron after the 14 
days prior to randomization.  
New Wording:  
3. Screening ferritin ≤300 ng/mL and Transferrin Sa turation (TSAT) <30%. 
4. Participants must have a documented history of an inadequate response to any oral 
iron therapy for at least  8 weeks (56 days ) prior to randomization . Because ferritin is an 
acute -phase reactant, 
ferritin may be normal 
or increased in iron -
deficient participants 
with other medical 
problems. This cutoff 
would not exclude 
participants with 
comorbidities.  The 
increased TSAT in 
combination with the 
ferritin measurement 
should adequately 
identify participants 
with iron deficiency 
anemia.

 In addition to the following text, Tables 1 “Mean Change from Screening in 
Hemoglobin, Ferritin, and TSAT (Safety Population)” and 2 “Overview of 
Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (Safety Population)” were added.  
Original Wording : 
While  the recommended total daily dose of oral elemental iron for the treatment of 
IDA in pediatric patients ranges between 3 -6 mg/kg/day divided into one to three 
doses, a total daily dose of 3 mg/kg/day divided into 2 dose s (maximum daily dose 
of 130 mg of elemental iron) was selected for all ages because evidence suggests 
that low -dose oral iron therapy may be as effective as higher doses.11 
Additionally, the simplified regimen may minimize adverse effects associated with 
high-dose oral iron therapy and thus improve medication adherence.13 
New Wording:  
Per the recommended total daily dose of oral elemental iron for the treatme nt of IDA 
in pediatric patients ranges between 3 -6 mg/ kg/day divided into one to three doses, a 
total daily dose of 6 mg/kg/day divided into 2 doses (maximum daily dose of 130 mg 
of elemental iron) was selected for all ages based on the most common practic e of

been selected based off evidence generated from Luitpold’s Phase II dose -finding 
PK/PD study in which cohorts received single, weight -based doses of FCM at either 
7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg.16 Results from this study demonstra te that the higher weight -
based dose  is both efficacious and safe  (summarized below in Table s 1 and 2) . The 
mean increase from baseline to Day 35 was larger for participants in Cohort 2 
receiving 15 mg/kg (2.8±1.15 g/dL) than those in Cohort 1 receiving 7. 5 mg/kg 
(1.9±1.38 g/dL). The mean increase in ferritin and TSAT at Day 35  was While the referenced

3.3 Rationale for Sparse PK Sampling  
Population -based PK/PD modelling describing the time course of total serum iron 
(TSI) concentrations and the relationship between TSI and changes of hemoglobin 
follo wing a single dose of intravenous FCM in pediatric subjects with iron deficiency 
anemia (IDA) has been performed using intensively sampled data from Study 
1VIT13036 .16  It is proposed to supplement this initial modelling with additional 
sparsely sampled  PK data from this study. Based on the anticipated visit duration on 
the 2 FCM administration days in this study, the following sparse PK sampling 
scheme is proposed: pre -dose, immediately post -infusion and [ADDRESS_798776] -dose 
on Days 0 and 7, on which subje cts will receive 15 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 
750 mg). This pragmatic approach, which minimizes the number of blood draws 
compared to a full PK profile, is expected to facilitate exposure -response analysis for 
the proposed FCM regimen.

CONFIDENTIAL   Administrative Change 1 Date:  Final 26 September 2019  
Page 77 of 93 Original Wording : 
Enrollment is planned for approximately 56 randomized participants (28 per 
treatment group). Based on Study 1VIT09031, a mean difference in change fr om 
baseline for hemoglobin of 1.0  g/dL between FCM and oral iron and a pooled 
standard deviation of 1.0 g/dL, 23 participants/group will achieve 90% power for 
the primary endpoint. Up to 56 participants/group will be randomized in order to 
account for prem ature discontinuations.  
New Wording:  
A total of 60 participants (30 per treatment group) are required to detect an expected 
difference in Hgb of 1.0 g/dL (common standard deviation = 1. 16 g/dL) at two -sided 
alpha=0.05 with 90% power.  Assuming 20% attrition of subjects not meeting th e 
definition of mITT, approximately 72 participants will be randomized.

8.5.4 CLINICAL LABORATORY 
FINDINGS  Original Wording : 
Clinical  laboratory variables will be presented in two ways.  First, the mean 
change from baseline to each scheduled visit will be summarized. Second, 
the number and percent of participants with treatment -emergent PCS 
laboratory values will be tabulated. Treatment -emergent PCS laboratory 
tests are those in which the baseline value is normal and post -baseline value 
is abnormal (i.e., meets Grade  III or Grade IV toxicity criteria from the NCI -
CTC).  Baseline will be defined as the last value obtained before 
randomiza tion.

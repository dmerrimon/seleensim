Overview of the Problem  
In 2010, 11.5% of all Gulf War -II veterans were unemployed; that figure rose to 
15.2% in January 2011 and continues to grow as the number of veterans from recent 
wars increases ([LOCATION_002] Department of Labor, 2011; Seal et al., 2009). The 
prevalence of  mental illness among veterans is also notable; estimates range from 31% 
(Seal et al., 2007) to nearly 37% (Seal et al., 2009) for any psychiatric disorder, and over 
half of these veterans are diagnosed with more than one psychiatric condition (Seal et 
al., 2007).  In addition, empi[INVESTIGATOR_640558] (Kessler et al., 2005). Linking 
unemployment and mental illness, a recent study found that 65% of veterans using VA 
healthcare were unemployed, and compared to employed veterans, the unemployed 
were more likely to have depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic  stress disorder 
(PTSD), schizophrenia, or substance use disorders. Vocational dysfunction was reported 
most often in disabled veterans with schizophrenia, PTSD, and substance use disorders 
(Zivin et al., 2011). Not surprisingly, this study also found that unemployed veterans had 
significantly lower income than employed persons. Similarly, a large study focusing 
specifically on veterans with PTSD concluded that vocational dysfunction is a notable 
problem among this group, as they were significantly less likely to be employed after 
participating in VA work programs compared with participants without the disorder 
(Resnick & Rosenheck, 2008). Because most individuals with mental illness desire to 
work in regular competitive employment (McQuilken et al., 2003), the nationwide 
problem of unemployment among veterans with mental illness is particularly troubling.  
The VA is addressing this need by [CONTACT_640582] (SE), a 
psychiatric rehabilitation approach that provides individual vocational assistance to 
veterans with mental illness. While the SE model is empi[INVESTIGATOR_640559] s hown to achieve partial success in improving employment 
outcomes, a sizable proportion of individuals, 40% or more, remain unemployed (Bond 
et al., 2008).  A further challenge is job retention; veterans with mental illness who obtain 
jobs frequently strugg le to maintain them long -term. Even in the context of high quality, 
evidence -based vocational services, most studies show only modest job retention of a 
few months (Bond et al., 2008), and consequently, frequent job losses and inconsistent 
vocational funct ioning remain a substantial and unsolved problem.  
 
Background  
Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an empi[INVESTIGATOR_133267], recovery based 
intervention that has been recommended as a best practice in the treatment of mental 
illness (Michon, van Weeghel, Kroon, & Schene, 2005 ). CBT is a standard component of 
veteran healthcare in the VA —as an integral part of routine outpatient multidisciplinary 
mental health care effectively treating conditions such as anxiety, depression,  and 
PTSD. CBT is also a central part of Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Center  
(PRRC)  programming and a core therapeutic technique used in Illness Management and 
Recovery (Gingerich & Mueser, 2005), an effective and widely implemented severe 
ment al illness self -management program. Furthermore, research indicates that CBT is 
well accepted by [CONTACT_640583] (e.g., Kingdon & Turkington, 1991) and is 
well suited to meet the treatment needs of diverse patients, including various ethnic 
groups (Horell & Voss, 2008), a range of diagnostic groups (Butler et al., 2006), 
inpatients and outpatients (e.g., Drury et al., 1996), and varying illness phases (e.g., 
acute versus stable; Tarrier et al., 2004).  
The majority of psychiatric treatments avail able to veterans —both 
psychotherapeutic (including CBT) and pharmacologic — target symptom reduction. 
Interventions to improve everyday functioning are lacking, and important veteran 
outcomes such as subjective quality of life are more strongly related to f unctional deficits 
than symptom severity in itself (e.g., Norman et al., 1999). While some psychiatric 
symptoms in severe mental illness are related to functioning, symptom improvements 
often do not directly translate to substantial functional improvement;  these outcomes are 
only modestly correlated (e.g., Wykes et al., 2008). In veterans with PTSD, research has 
demonstrated a stronger relationship between symptom improvement and functional 
benefits, although functional outcomes in these published studies h ave most often 
measured in terms of physical health and social functioning (e.g., Shea et al., 2010), 
largely ignoring the important area of vocational functioning. Overall, the propensity of 
research suggests that the utility of therapeutic approaches tha t solely target symptoms 
is limited. Furthermore, utilizing a combined approach that focuses on functional 
improvements (including vocational functioning) in addition to symptomatic relief is 
consistent with the recovery movement, centered on the notion th at people with mental 
illness can lead meaningful and productive lives despi[INVESTIGATOR_640560] (Anthony, 1993). Lastly, as discussed in a later section, the development of 
interventions to aid functioning in mental illness is critical, gi ven the substantial personal 
and societal consequences of such deficits.  
Previous interventions that have combined CBT with rehabilitation practices 
targeting instrumental role functioning have had positive results. One that has been 
studied —CBT combined with social skills training, has shown incremental benefit above 
and beyond the effects of CBT or social skills training alone. In response to this program, 
veterans with severe mental illness have shown improvements in long -term social 
functioning, greate r skills mastery, and improved cognitive insight (e.g., Granholm et al., 
2005).  
Competitive work functioning is a promising next application of CBT intervention. 
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_640561]’s ability to excel 
vocational ly seriously damage work outcomes (Gallo, 1994).  Specifically, people with 
severe mental illness endorse the belief of low likelihood of success at work, even with 
assistance (e.g., Roe, 2001). Influencing these beliefs are other beliefs related to low 
self worth, low levels of perceived competence, and poor general self -efficacy (e.g., 
Davis et al., 2004). Studies have also linked negative self beliefs that may impact work 
ability with illness -related factors such as poor participation in treatment  (e.g.,  Brekke & 
Long, 2000),  ineffective copi[INVESTIGATOR_175812] (e.g., Kleim et al., 2008), poor social functioning 
(e.g., Lysaker et al., 2007; Roe, 2003), and barren personal narratives  characterized by 
[CONTACT_640584] (Ly saker, Buck, Taylor & Roe, 
2008). In addition, prior research has demonstrated that such negative expectations are 
associated with higher levels of alienation, a greater tendency to ignore stressors, and 
more severe symptoms of emotional discomfort (Lysake r et al., 2008).  
Prospective quantitative studies have shown a moderately strong relationship 
between maladaptive vocational beliefs and employment outcomes. For instance, 
Regenold and colleagues (1999) found that work -related self -efficacy significantly 
predicted success in obtaining a job over a 13 month follow -up period in a sample of 
people with mental illness (i.e., mood disorders, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, and 
personality disorders) receiving supported employment services. Similarly, an earlie r 
study (Arns & Linney, 1993) found a moderate association between negative beliefs 
about work ability and employment outcomes (change from unemployed to employed) 
over six months in a community mental health sample.  Moreover, prior theory -based 
research has attempted to explain these findings, highlighting the importance of self -
efficacy and perceptions of employment barriers in determining motivation, decisions to 
seek out work in the community, and purposive action towards career goals (Albert & 
Luzzo, 1999).  
Stigma is another key factor linking negative self beliefs with poor work 
outcomes. Society often views people with mental illness as being unable to work; 
accordingly, persons with mental illness are frequently advised to lower their career 
expecta tions much below that of their educational background, expertise, and previous 
work experience (Link et al., 1999).  Self stigma, or internalization of this belief, often 
leads to poor self esteem and expectations of work failure that may take the form of a 
self-fulfilling prophecy, such as: “I’ll never be able to do this job.” Consequently, persons 
with mental illness are often less likely to seek out employment opportunities, tend not to 
persevere when faced with complex challenges on the job, and engage in less active 
problem solving (Lysaker et al., 2009). Consistent with these notions, extant studies 
have found a relationship between endorsement of self stigma, poor self esteem, and 
lower participation in community activities, including work. In general , stigma is accepted 
as a barrier to mental health care and personal recovery across psychiatric conditions, 
including mood disorders, schizophrenia and PTSD (e.g., Corrigan, 2004).  
In addition to maladaptive thoughts about work ability, the challenges and  deficits 
imposed by [CONTACT_640585]. In the past [ADDRESS_857312] linked neurocognitive deficits (Green, 
Kern, & Heaton, 2004), poor intrapsychic functioning (e.g., Rosenheck et al., 2 006), 
deficits in social functioning (Banks et al., 2001), and severe psychiatric symptoms (e.g., 
Milev et al., 2005) with lower vocational attainment. Recently, studies have also begun to 
examine the role of metacognition, defined as the ability to think about one’s own mental 
activity and that of others, thinking about oneself and others in a larger social context, 
and integrating that knowledge to face life’s problems and challenges (Semerari et al., 
2003). Metacognition has been found to be independentl y related to work performance 
(Lysaker et al., 2010) and has been identified as a mediating variable involved in the 
complex relationship between neurocognition, social discomfort, and vocational 
functioning (Bell et al., 2009). Metacognition is also inext ricably linked with the tenets of 
CBT, and similarly, several of the other aforementioned challenges and deficits are 
effectively treated with CBT based approaches.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_640562], no CBT interventions have been 
developed specifically to improve competitive employment outcomes.  The sole existing 
CBT program addressing work -related themes is the Indianapolis Vocational Intervention 
Program (IVIP). The IVIP  was designed and tested at the Roudebush VAMC in 
protected work programs that placed veterans with schizophrenia into temporary 
sheltered (noncompetitive) work positions within the VA and in businesses contracted by 
[CONTACT_41309] (Davis et al., 2005). However, c ompetitive employment differs in several notable 
ways from noncompetitive employment: 1) noncompetitive work settings are not 
integrated (i.e., they are reserved only for those with mental illness); these “protected” 
work environments are not consistent wi th the goals of community inclusion and 
independence (Wehman, Revell, & Brooke, 2003); 2) noncompetitive jobs are most often 
“low level” jobs and feature less rigorous and complex job demands and responsibilities 
than competitive jobs; 3) competitive jobs often offer unique and interpersonally complex 
work environments (Loveland, Driscoll, & Boyle, 2007); 4) noncompetitive jobs typi[INVESTIGATOR_640563]; 5) noncompetitive jobs are time limited, i.e., temporary; 6) 
noncompetitive positions offer l ittle opportunity for career advancement; 7) Lastly and 
perhaps most importantly, veterans with mental illness overwhelmingly desire 
competitive jobs in the community in which they can reach their vocational and career 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1520] (e.g., Wehman et al., 200 3).  As a result, an intervention specifically tailored 
to achieve this goal is essential.  
This project is critical for veterans with mental illness and is consistent with 
national priorities. Recently, federal lawmakers have heavily emphasized the vital need 
to help veterans succeed vocationally. Accordingly, in November 2011, President 
Obama signed into law the “VOW to Hire Heroes Act”(P.L. 112 -56), which includes 
measures to target the growing problem of unemployment among veterans with service -
connecte d disabilities. The goals of my proposal are also consistent with the “Americans 
with Disabilities Act,” which spearheaded the movement to equalize vocational 
opportunities for all, despi[INVESTIGATOR_640564] (Americans with Disabilities 
Act, 19 90).  
This CBT intervention has the potential to complement existing supported 
employment services within the VA. CBT addresses psychosocial barriers to vocational 
functioning, whereas supported employment addresses the long -term logistical aspects 
of finding and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a job.  Together, these empi[INVESTIGATOR_640565]; this notion 
is also consistent with the VA goal of providing patient -centered care (Seal et al., 2007). 
Both CBT and SE further promote patient centered care by [CONTACT_640586], goals, and adopt an educational and collaborative style that is well -
accepted by [CONTACT_123896] (e.g., Beck et al., 2009; Drake & Bond, 2011; Kingdon & 
Turkington, 1991).  
Significance to Veterans’ Health  
Employment is not only a means of economic independence, but it is crucial to 
maintaining psychological health (see Blustein, 2008). The link between work and 
mental health benefits has been repeatedly demons trated in general population studies 
(e.g., Murphy & Athanasou, 1999 ). In line with these findings, in psychiatric populations, 
work is related to better overall functioning (Mueser et al., 1997; Burns et al., 2009) and 
a host of clinical, social, and qual ity of life benefits (Bond et al., 2001; Burns et al., 2009; 
Twamley et al., 2008).  Studies of veterans actively employed in VA work programs are 
consistent with these findings, demonstrating clear benefits of work activity on overall 
veteran well -being (e .g., Bryson et al., 2002).  In contrast, mere participation in supported 
employment has largely not been shown to improve nonvocational outcomes, including 
clinical outcomes, quality of life, socialization, and beliefs about the self (Burns et al., 
2009; Go ld et al., 2006; Mueser et al., 2004; Twamley et al., 2008). For instance, 
Mueser and colleagues (2004) found that participation in supported employment did not 
impact self -esteem in persons with mental illness over two years. Work itself, rather than 
supp orted employment services, seems to be the critical ingredient positively impacting 
nonvocational outcomes. That is, persons with mental illness who participate in 
supported employment services and successfully find and keep work in the community 
for long stretches have the most favorable outcomes. Conversely, persons with mental 
illness who engage in SE services, but still cannot find and keep jobs (i.e., the 
“nonresponders”), have poorer personal outcomes.  
In contrast to employment,  unemployment in people  with mental illness is 
associated with a higher risk of poverty and a greater reliance on government 
entitlements and the service system. Psychiatric disabilities represent the largest and 
most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_156438] -group of social security beneficiaries (G oodman & Stapleton, 
2005). Lower vocational attainment in psychiatric populations is also linked with a range 
of poor recovery outcomes (e.g., Kukla, Bond, & Xie, 2012). Qualitative research has 
further highlighted the association between the lack of emplo yment and devastating 
personal consequences, such as depression, self pi[INVESTIGATOR_209034], self absorption, higher risk of 
substance abuse, and feelings of worthlessness (Marrone & Golowka, 1999).  
The mental health and quality of life benefits of work have been demonstr ated 
most strongly for long term employment, as opposed to a working only a short period of 
time.  Steady competitive work (i.e., working 50% or more of the follow -up period) is 
associated with fewer days of psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640566] (Kukla et al., 2012).  Other 
prospective studies have supported a link between steady periods of competitive work 
and greater rates of symptom improvement, better quality of life, and higher self esteem 
compared to persons who are unemployed or employed only a short period of time (e.g., 
Bond et al., 2001). A recent study by [CONTACT_640587]. (2009) found that people with mental 
illness who worked in consistent competitive employment over ten years had a  
significantly more rapid decline across time in service utilization and outpatient mental 
health costs compared with persons who had an unstable employment course and 
worked little over time. This is a notable point because veterans with mental illness of ten 
have problems with job retention —studies have found that the majority of persons with 
mental illness experience a job loss within the first four to eight months, even with the 
assistance of evidence -based supported employment services (Bond et al., 200 8; Bond 
& Kukla, 2011). Short periods of job retention are further harmful because they hinder 
career advancement and vocational growth that typi[INVESTIGATOR_640567] (Gioia, 2005).  
Furthermore, difficulties with job retention in mental illness stem from  a variety of 
causes, such as interpersonal problems in the workplace (e.g., Becker et al., 1998), 
psychiatric symptom exacerbations (e.g., Biegel et al., 2010), and active substance use. 
Considering this last point, Zivin et al. (2011) found that unemploy ment in veterans using 
VA healthcare was associated with a greater likelihood of having a substance use 
disorder.  Currently, VA vocational services are not designed to directly address these 
complex causes; cognitive behavioral approaches have been sugges ted as useful 
interventions to complement supported employment and overcome individual -level and 
disease -related barriers to employment (e.g., Loveland et al., 2007).  
 
Preliminary Studies  
This current  project follows  four preliminary studies. In the first preliminary study, 
veterans with a range of mental illnesses provided their perspectives  on factors 
impactin g work success in the community.  Findings illustrate a complex set of 
contribut ors, including  personal motivation, self efficacy,  sense of self,  interpersonal 
issues, and an array of other health related factors  (Kukla, Bonfils, & Salyers, 2015 ). 
This study also demonstrated that v eteran -specific facets, such as combat history , 
notably interplay with factors related to work outcomes (Kukla, Rattray, &  Salyers, 2015).  
In the second preliminary study, a  nationwide sample of  114 VA SE staff, 
supervisors, and managers rated important factors related to veteran work outcomes 
and answered qualitative questions regarding additional important factors; they also 
provided their views on the usefulness of a CBT intervention as an adjunct to existing 
vocational services. Result s emphasize the importance of veteran motivation , 
psychological stress,  and self confidence in work ability  (Kukla, McGuire, & Salyers, 
2015 ). Further, SE personnel perceived CBT to be a potentially key intervention to 
address these barriers in veterans wi th mental illness .  
Third, a recent study involving a secondary analysis of data  examined  two 
important research questions pertaining to CBT outcomes in working veterans with 
mental illness : (1) What are the predictors of CBT treatment engagement? (2) What  are 
the predictors of CBT treatment success and failure? Findings indicate a nuanced, 
differential profile of key predictors where neurocognitive factors (i.e., poor attention) 
played a key role in treatment engagement  while psychological factors, such as  self 
esteem  played a greater role in successful vocational outcomes  (Kukla, Davis, & 
Lysaker, 2014) .  
In the fourth  preliminary study , the Indianapolis Vocational Intervention program, 
a CBT program for persons with severe mental illness seeking noncompetitive, time -
limited work placements  (Davis et al., 2005) , was adapted for veterans with a range of 
mental illnesses who are pursuing/engaged in  competitive work in the community.  Using 
an empi[INVESTIGATOR_640568] , iterative  approach, t he revisions and adaptations  were guided 
by [CONTACT_188798], the findings from the aforementioned  preliminary stud ies, and 
formative data collected from veteran participants during the study . The resultant new 
intervention  that is the focus of this cur rent study , termed the CBT for work success 
(CBT w ) program , demonstrated promising preliminary benefits ; in a small group of 
veterans with mental illness, CBT w was associated improved  employment outcomes  and 
was highly acceptable to participants  and vocational staff. CBTw was also  feasi ble to 
implement  (Kukla, Strasburger, & Lysaker, 2016; Kukla , Strasburger, Salyers, Rattray, & 
Lysaker, 2017 ).  
 
Rationale  
Rationale : Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) effectively reduces symptoms across a 
range of psychiatric conditions (Butler et al., 2006; Wykes et al.,  2008); however, its 
benefit to functioning remains less well understood. Some studies have evidenced a 
positive influence of CBT on functional outcomes, whereas others have not. One 
possible explanation for these inconsistencies across studies is that CBT  interventions 
are most often focused on symptoms rather than community functioning. The few CBT 
interventions that have been specifically designed to address functioni ng have shown 
promising results . One functional area of critical importance is work —a central goal of 
most veterans with (and without) mental illness. However, work functioning has received 
little empi[INVESTIGATOR_640569]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_640570] (e.g., Hoffman et al., 2000 ; Kukla, Bonfils & Salyers, 2015; Kukla, 
McGuire, & Salyers, 2015 ), no CBT programs have been developed specifically 
targeting vocational themes with the goal of improving competitive work outcomes. 
Further, a recent paper outlined needed avenues of future study in the SE domain; 
Drake and Bond (2011) state that cognitive strategies may be a fruitful area to develop 
to help “nonresponder” consumers with mental illness who struggle with vocat ional 
dysfunction despi[INVESTIGATOR_640571]. The goal of the current project is 
to address this gap and the serious problem of unemployment in veterans with mental 
illness by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_640572]  (CBT w) and assess ing key 
employment outcomes before and after the intervention .  
 
 
Overall  Design : 
Adult  participants will take part in the [ADDRESS_857313] of 
assessments of competitive employment outcomes, important psychosocial outcomes, 
and background and demographic variables at baseline and at two follow -up periods —
immediately following the conclusion of the  CBT w  program  (12 week follow up point)  and 
at a 6 month follow up . The 6 month follow up period is exploratory.  
 
Setting and Participants :  
Inclusion criteria  is a diagnosis of any mental disorder as confirmed through 
medical record review ; common diagnoses include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, 
PTSD , personality disorders,  anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders . Second, 
participants must be enrolled in VA supported employment services.  Third , participants 
must also have an  active goal of working in the community; participants can be currently 
working in the community or unemployed and searching for work.  Both veterans 
seeking employment and those currently employed will be eligible for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_640573]. That is, people with mental illness 
commonly move in and out of job search and job maintenance phases over time and our 
findings will apply to the average veteran receiving SE services.  In addition, including 
veterans in steady employment as well as those who are searching for a job (and ma y 
be experiencing more vocational instability) will reduce selection bias. In other words, we 
are not limiting our sample to only those veterans who are highest functioning with the 
greatest work ability.   
Exclusion criteria  is a major cognitive deficit or  severe medical condition that 
would prevent participation in the intervention and/or community work.   
 
Intervention :  
The CBT w program includes 12 sessions that are delivered in a weekly one -hour 
group format. S essions focused on identifying and modifying maladaptive thoughts 
related to work, enhancing self efficacy and beliefs in one’s ability to succeed at work, 
identifying and addressing personal barriers to work, and increasing beneficial copi[INVESTIGATOR_640574] , including during the job 
search phase and working on the job . The intervention is tailored toward both employed 
and unemployed persons seeking community work. Session content includes the 
following modules: Int roduction —Work goals and work story; CBT model and work; 
Thinking about work; Barriers to work; Copi[INVESTIGATOR_486359]; Copi[INVESTIGATOR_640575]; Communication at work; Dealing effectively with people at work; 
Managing work success;  Personal work success plan.   
 
Procedures : 
Participants will be recruited from the SE program  at the Roudebush VA  Medical 
Center . Eligible p articipants will be approached by [CONTACT_640588]; if veterans express interest in participating, they will be 
provided with a study information sheet  further explaining details of the study  and a 
member of the study team will call them  to schedule a time for the baseline assessment ; 
during this time, written  informed consent will be obtained .  
Baseline and follow -up assessments  (post -intervention and 6 month follow -up) 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_7355] . Currently, several research assistants in 
our VAMC research service  have been trained in intervi ewing veterans with mental 
illness including completing standardized symptom and psychosocial rating  scales.  The 
assessments  will take approximately 60 -90 minutes and participants  will be paid $[ADDRESS_857314]. Kukla  (PI), 
a licensed clinical psychologist with extensive clinica l and research expertise in CBT or 
the project  manager, who has years of experience facilitating CBT interventions for 
veterans with mental illness (including the preliminary study of the adaptation of the 
CBT w program) along with a pre -doctoral clinical psychology practicum student s. Student 
facilitators  will first be trained in the CBT w program  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kukla . Lastly, periodic fidelity 
assessments will be conducted by a senior investigator  and trained research staff to 
assess adherence to the general CBT model.   
 
Study Measures : 
 
Unless otherwise specified, study measures will be collected baseline and the 
12-week follow up point (post intervention). Some measures will be assessed at the 6 
month follow up; these  are exploratory.   
 
Background Characteristics . Collected at baseline only, p articipant background 
characteristics will include sex, age, ethnicity,  mental health diagnosis,  educational 
attainment, marital status, residential status,  current work status 
(employed/unemployed),  work history (i.e., weeks worked during the six months 
preceding the study ), residen tial status , and legal  history (i.e. , number of felony 
convictions) . We will collect this data through a combination of SE records, patient 
medical records (i.e., CPRS), and participant self -report.  
 
Competitive Employment  Outcomes . Competitive employment outcomes will be 
assessed  at baseline and the follow up periods  through participant self -report and 
supported employment records when available. These outcomes are standard in studies 
of employment in persons with mental illness an d will include change in competitive 
employment  define d as change in numbe r of weeks worked  in competitive jobs , 
comparing the baseline period (i.e. 6 months preceding baseline) and the [ADDRESS_857315] 50% of the follow up period in a 
competitive job . 
 
Work -related self -efficacy .  Work related self -efficacy is defined as one’s 
perceived ability and confidence to perform work activities.  Given that the adapted C BT 
program will seek to improve these perceptions, we will measure this construct using the 
Work -Related Self -efficacy Scale (Waghorn et al., 2005). The [ADDRESS_857316] that the scale has adequate to good reliability and 
validity in adults with mental illness living in the community (Harris et al., 2010).  
 
Motivation to work : Motivation to work will be measured by [CONTACT_941] 18-item Work 
Extrinsic and Intrinsic Motivation Scale (WEIMS) based on self determination theory . 
The WEIMS is scored on a 1 to 7 Likert scale (‘Does not correspond at all’ to 
‘Corresponds exactly’) with higher scores indicating higher levels of each domain of 
motivation.  The WEIMS has been shown to have strong predictive validity, correlating 
highly with work behaviors ( e.g., Tremblay et al., 2009).  
 
Work effectiveness & Work Productivity .  The Work and Health Interview 
(Stewart et al., 2003) will assess work effectiveness and work productivity  for 
participants who are currently working (unemployed participants will not complete these 
measures) . Work effectiveness will be measured by [CONTACT_640589] -report item —“ On da ys that 
you worked during the past 4 weeks, how effective were you in your job on 
average?   Please tell me, on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0% means that you were not at 
all effective, and 100% means that you were completely effective, how effective would 
you say you have been on your job during the past 4 weeks?” Work productivity will be 
measured by 7 self -report items scored on a Likert scale ranging from 0, “none of the 
time” to 4, “all the time” (item example: “Work more slowly than usual?”). Participant s will 
report on work productivity over the last two weeks. The Work and Health Interview has 
been used widely in patients with chronic conditions, demonstrating good psychometric 
properties.  
 
Self-esteem : The Rosenberg self esteem scale, a 10 -item Likert scale (1 -strongly 
agree; 2 -agree; 3 -disagree; 4 -strongly disagree) will examine self esteem (Rosenberg, 
1965); higher scores on the RSES indicate higher levels of a unidimensional self -esteem 
construct. The R SES has been used extensively in samples of persons with and without 
mental illness and across various ethnic and cultural groups, demonstrating good 
reliability and validity (e.g. Link et al., 2014).  
 
Quality of Life . Prior studies in the mental health domain have demonstrated that 
quality of life improves in response to CBT treatment, therefore, as discussed above with 
regard to symptoms, quality of life may be enhanced in response to CBT treatment, 
regardless of the impact on work outcomes . The Quality  of Life Interview (QOLI; 
Lehman, 1988), developed specifically for a psychiatric population, will measure veteran 
quality of life. We will focus on the  health  domain of the QOLI .  The QOLI has been 
shown to have very good reliability and validity in adult outpatients (Lehman, 1988; 
Lehman et al., 1993) .  
 
Subjective Recovery : Global perceived recovery will be assessed by [CONTACT_640590] (Corrigan et al., 1999), a [ADDRESS_857317] been associated with key functional 
outcomes, including employment, it is appropriate to examine in this study.  The self -
report RAS  is scored on a 1 to 5 Likert scale from ‘strongly disagree ’ to ‘strongly agre e’ 
(e.g., “I have  a desire to succeed.”). Higher scores indicate stronger held perceptions of 
personal recovery. The RAS has shown good test retest reliability, internal consistency, 
and criterion -related validity (Corrigan et al., 1999).  
 
Psychiatric Symptoms . Symptoms are essential to assess in this study, as they 
are often the primary beneficiary of CBT intervention, demonstrating moderate to large 
effect sizes in randomized trials across numerous psychiatric conditions. Thus, it is 
possible that symptoms may improve in response to CBT treatment, regardless of 
change in employment status.  
Psychiatric symptoms often present in schizophrenia -spectrum disorders will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_331902] (PANSS), which has been used 
extensively i n studies of psychiatric rehabilitation and CBT. The PANSS (Kay et al., 
1987)  is comprised of 30 items scored on a 1 to 7 Likert scale, in which the total score is 
obtained by [CONTACT_366759] g up scores on all 30 items (total scores range from 30 to 240). The 
PANSS has five subscales identified via factor analytic studies including the Positive 
syndrome (6 items), Negative syndrome (8 items), Emotional discomfort (4 items), 
Hostility (4 items) , and Cognitive (7 items). The PANSS has adequate reliability and 
validity (Kay et al., 1987).  
In addition, we will assess depression and anxiety, two commonly occurring 
psychiatric conditions in veterans (Seal et al., 2007); depression and anxiety are li nked 
with vocational dysfunction and have been demonstrated to respond well to CBT (e.g., 
Butler et al., 2006). Current levels of depression will be assessed using the Beck 
Depression Inventory, Second Edition (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996). The BDI -II conta ins 
21 items that assess the various mood and bodily symptoms of depression; participants 
are asked to respond based on symptoms during the past two weeks. There are four 
response options for each item reflecting increasing severity of depression; the tota l 
score is obtained by [CONTACT_640591] (0 -3). The BDI -II is the gold 
standard tool to assess depression in both non -clinical and psychiatric populations and 
has been shown to have excellent reliability and validity across several prior s tudies 
(e.g., Yin & Fan, 2000).  
Thirdly, symptoms of anxiety will be assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory 
(Beck & Steer, 1993). The BAI has 21 items, each describing a psychological or 
physiological symptom of anxiety (e.g., “Nervous”) that responden ts rate on a 0 to 3 
Likert Scale (“not at all” to “severely”) based on how much they have been bothered by 
[CONTACT_640592]. The BAI has been widely used to assess anxiety in 
adults with mental illness and has been demonstrated to have stro ng psychometric 
properties (e.g., Fydrich, Dowdall, & Chambless, 1992) .   
 
Privacy/Confidentiality Issues : 
The possible risks to participants  associated with participation of this study are a 
remote risk of loss of confidentiality and psychological risks. We will keep all research 
records private to the extent of the law. Original copi[INVESTIGATOR_640576] w sessions  will be kept in a locked file cabinet and on a secure 
server. The data will be maintained in a secured computer database in a password -
protected computer, located in a limited access, locked room. Access to all data will b e 
restricted to members of the evaluation team.  Data will be kept for seven years 
according to state and federal regulations and destroyed at the end of that period. The 
other possible risk may be psychological risks associated with participation in the CBTw 
group . We will try to minimize this potential psychological risk by [CONTACT_640593]. Participants may also skip or refuse to answer 
any questions that they would like.  
    Given the low anticipated risk of adverse events, special safety -monitoring 
procedures above and beyond those of the VA will be minimal. Participants will have 
access to the principal investigator’s e -mail address and phone number and will be 
invited to inform the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_640577]. All adverse events will be 
reported to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_640578]’s IRB. Given that the pi[INVESTIGATOR_640579], reporting will be limited to the IRB and will not include the 
NIH OBA or the FDA. All procedures for safety monitoring required by [CONTACT_640594].  
 
 
 
 
Statistical Analysi s Plan  
 Data will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for the S ocial Sciences 
(SPSS), version [ADDRESS_857318]-treatment  (12 week follow up) . This mean and 
standard deviation information obtained will be used for sample size calculation for a 
future expanded randomized trial.  
Next, the primary study outcome of weeks worked during the baseline period (6 
months preceding baseline) and the 6 mon ths study period  will be compared using  
dependent  groups  (paired samples)  t-tests.  Significance values for t-tests will be set at 
p<.05. The secondary work outcome, attainment of steady competitive work will be 
characterized using percentage of total participants  achieving this benchmark . Becau se 
secondary outcomes are exploratory, these will be characterized using descri ptive 
statistics , such as means and standard deviations.  
 
Missing Data : 
To address the issue of missing follow -up data, participants’ baseline 
characteristics will be compared between those with and without missing data. We will 
also fit a logistic regression model to compare intervention and control participants with 
missing outcome data to determine whether missing data is completely at random. If not 
random, we will perform the analysis with complete cases, using LOCF imputation 
method. M ultiple imputation techniques will be used to evaluate the robustness of our 
analysis for the main outcome.

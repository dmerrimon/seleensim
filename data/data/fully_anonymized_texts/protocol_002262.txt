Study Title:  A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study of BBI608 in Combination with 
Sorafenib, or BBI503 in Combination with Sorafenib in Adult 
Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
Study Number:  BBI608-503-103HCC  
Study Phase:  Phase Ib/II  
Study Drugs:  BBI608 and BBI503, investigational, small molecule, anticancer drugs that are 
hypothesized to affect multiple oncogenic pathways , including pathways 
implicated in cancer stem cell viability .  
Primary Objectives:  Phase Ib:  
To determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) 
of BBI608 administered in combination with sorafenib and of BBI503 
administered in combination with sorafenib in adult patients with advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic c hemotherapy.  
Phase II:  
To evaluate  the tolerability , safety. and preliminary anti -tumor activity  in 
patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma randomized to receive 
treatment with sorafenib  in combination with BBI608 , sorafenib  in combination 
with BBI 503, or sorafenib alone ; BBI608 and BBI503 would be administered 
at their respective RP2D dose levels for combination administration with 
sorafenib , which were determined during phase Ib.  
Secondary 
Objectives:  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of B BI608 administered in 
combination with sorafenib and of BBI503 administered in combination with 
sorafenib.  
To perform  biomarker  studies  for BBI608 administered in combination with 
sorafenib and for BBI503 administered in combination with sorafenib.  
Study Design:  
 This is an open label, phase Ib/II study.  The study population is adult patients 
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received systemic 
chemotherapy.   
The phase Ib portion will involve dose -escalation of BBI608 administered in 
combination with a fixed starting dose of sorafenib (Arm 1), and dose escalation 
of BBI503 administered in combination with a fixed starting dose of sorafenib 
(Arm 2).   The fixed starting dose -level of sorafenib for both arms will be 400 
mg twice daily (800 m g total daily dose).  Eligible patients will be randomized 
to either Arm 1  or Arm 2.   
In Arm 1, e scalating doses of BBI608 will be administered to cohorts of three 
to six patients until RP2D is determined according to the criteria for determining 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the criteria for dose -escalation .  
In Arm 2 , escalating doses of BBI503 will be administered to cohorts of three 
to six patients until RP2D is determined according to the criteria for determining 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and th e criteria for dose -escalation.   
Prior to initiation of combination therapy in each arm, sorafenib will be 
administered as monotherapy starting on Cycle 1, Day [ADDRESS_1281803] label is allowed .  
Following the sorafenib run -in period, the combination regimen will begin on 
Cycle 1, Day 15.  Protocol therapy will continue in repeating 28 -day cycles until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion 
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 3 is met .   
For both arms, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies will be performed on Cycle 1, Day 
[ADDRESS_1281804] not received prior systemic treatment .  
Patients will be  randomized to receive either, Arm 1: sorafenib admini stered in 
combination with BBI608 (at the RP2D determined for BBI608 plus sorafenib 
during the phase Ib portion); Arm 2: sorafenib in combination with BBI503 (at 
the RP2D determined for BBI503 plus sorafenib during the phase Ib portion), 
or Arm 3 : sorafeni b alone at a starting dose of 400 mg twice daily.  The starting 
dose for sorafenib is the same for all study arms.  
Note:  
Once the amendment [ADDRESS_1281805], there were approximately 10 
subjects already enrolled in Arm 2.  Therefore, the actual sample size in Phase 
II in the end is projected to be appro ximately 70 patients after the amendment 3  
Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed in patients with readily 
accessible tumors through an optional on -study tumor biopsy.  Archival tissue, 
if available, will be collected from all patients.  
Throughout  the study,  safety and tolerability of BBI608 in combination with 
sorafenib and of BBI503 in combination with sorafenib will be assessed for the 
duration of study treatment and up to 30 days after discontinuation of study drug 
(either BBI608 or BBI503).   
Evaluation of anti -tumor activity will be performed at regular 8 –week intervals, 
with the first assessment 8 weeks (56-days) after Cycle 1, Day 1.  The radiologic 
assessments will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1281806] 
(mRECIST) for patien ts with HCC.  Alpha -feto protein (AFP) measurement 
will be performed at baseline, at the end of the [ADDRESS_1281807] criteria (either RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1281808] for patients with HCC), 
provided that the patient is obtaining potential clinical benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046].  If sorafenib is discontinued due to sorafenib -related toxicities, 
study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) may be continued.   
Study Population:  
 This study will enroll patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
arising from any setting who have not received prior systemic chemotherapy for 
their disease, and for which sorafenib is an appropriate treatment option in the 
judgment of the tre ating investigator.   
Prior surgical or loco -regional therapy is allowed, including trans -catheter 
arterial embolization, trans -catheter arterial chemoembolization, percutaneous 
ethanol injection, or radiofrequency ablation, provided  that the procedure was  
performed at least [ADDRESS_1281809] (either RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1281810] for patients with HCC) since the surgical procedure.

Confidential    Page: 4 Additional key inclusion criteria include:  ECOG performance status < 1, Child -
Pugh class A  and B7  albumin , adequate renal function, and a life expectancy of 
greater than [ADDRESS_1281811], Dose, 
and Mode of 
Administration:  
 Phase Ib:  
Patients in this trial will receive study drug in combination with a fixed dose of 
sorafenib according to the arm they are randomly assigned to and according to 
the dose -level cohort that is currently open.  
Sorafenib will be administered at a fixed dose of 400 mg twice daily (800 mg 
total daily dose).  This dose of sorafenib will be the same for each arm and for 
each dose -level cohort.  Sorafenib should be taken on an empty stomach, one 
hour prior to or two hours after meals.  Sorafenib should not be taken with study 
drug, and at least 2 hours should separate a dose of sorafenib from a dose of 
study drug.  
The starting dose of study drug (BBI608 or BBI503) and dosing ins tructions for 
each arm during the phase are as follows.  
Arm 1:  
BBI608 will be administered orally, twice daily , with approximately [ADDRESS_1281812] dose of 
sorafenib.   
The dose of BBI608 to be administered will depe nd on the assigned dose -level 
cohort as follows in the table below:  
BBI608 Dose Level  BBI608 Dose & Schedule  
BBI608 Dose -Level I  160 mg Twice Daily  
BBI608 Dose -Level II  240 mg Twice Daily  
Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled at BBI608 Dose -Level 1.  Dose -escalation 
will proceed according to the Criteria for Dose Escalation and Criteria for 
Determination of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT).  
Alternate and/or intermediate dose -levels are permit ted upon agreement  with 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_912272].  
Arm 2:  
BBI503 will be administered orally, daily. The daily dose of BBI503 will be 
administered before bed.  The dose of BBI503 to be administered will depend 
on the assigned dose -level cohort as follows in the table below:  
BBI503 Dose Level  BBI503 Dose & Schedule  
BBI503 Dose -Level I  100 mg Once Daily  
BBI503 Dose -Level II  200 mg Once Daily  
Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled at BBI503 Dose -Level 1.  Dose -escalation 
will proceed according to the Criteria for Dose Escalation and Criteria for 
Determination of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT).   
Intermediate dose -levels are permitted upon agreeme nt with the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_912272].  The total daily dose of 
BBI503 may be divided into sub -doses.

Confidential    Page: 5 Phase II Portion:  
The dose of BBI608 or BBI503 *to be administered in combination with 
sorafenib during the phase II port ion will be the RP2D determined during the 
phase Ib dose -escalation portion of study.  Sorafenib administration will be as 
described for the phase Ib portion.   
* Once the amendment [ADDRESS_1281813], Arm 2 in Phase II portion will be closed 
for enrollment  
Criteria for Dose 
Escalation – Phase 
Ib Portion Only  Enrollment at the next dose level and/or additional patients into the ongoing 
cohort will occur according to the following criteria:  
• If zero treated patients experience a DLT (defined below) by [CONTACT_2006] 28 of  
continuous daily dosing, then dose escalation will occur.  
• If one treated patient experiences a DLT (defined below) by [CONTACT_2006] 28 of 
continuous daily dosing, then an additional three patients will be enrolled 
for a total of six patients treated at the same dos e level.  Escalation will 
occur if no additional DLTs are seen in that cohort (one of six patients).  
• If two or more treated patients at a dose level experience a DLT by [CONTACT_2006] 
28 of continuous daily dosing, this will be the maximally administered 
dose.     
• A total of six patients will be treated at the previous dose level, and 
subsequent escalation will not exceed the maximally administered dose.   
The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level at which no 
more than one out of six patients have an observable DLT.  RP2D will be 
determined according to safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics.  The criteria 
for dose -escalation will apply to a given administration schedule independently.  
Criteria for 
Determination of 
Dose -Limiting 
Toxicity:  
 Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as the occurrence of any of the 
following toxicities possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug (either 
BBI608 or BBI503) or to study drug in combination with sorafenib during the 
first 28 days of combin ation therapy, unless there is a clear alternative 
explanation:   
• CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 4 
hematological toxicity.  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia in the presence of active bleeding will be 
considered a DLT.  
• Grade 3 or 4 non -hematological toxicity, except for Grade 3 
nausea/vomiting/anorexia, diarrhea, or fatigue, s ymptoms that will be 
considered  DLTs only if they persist more than seven (7) days despi[INVESTIGATOR_115047] .  Grade [ADDRESS_1281814] 28 days of BBI608 or BBI503 therapy in combination with sorafenib.  
DLT will be determined from adverse events, as well as changes from baseline 
in physical examination findi ngs and laboratory parameters.   
The criteria for determination of DLT will apply to a given administration 
schedule independently.  Patients who discontinue protocol therapy for a reason 
other than DLT may be replaced in order to fully evaluate a given do se-level.   
Duration of 
Treatment:  For an individual patient, treatment with study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) 
and sorafenib will continue in 28 -day cycles or until the investigator determines 
the patient is no longer deriving potential clinical benefit due to unacceptable 
toxicity, dise ase progression, or another discontinuation criterion.   
A patient may continue protocol therapy beyond progression that is determined 
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: [ADDRESS_1281815] patients will receive between 4 and 24 weeks of 
treatment.  
Pharmacokinetic 
and 
Pharmacodynamic 
Variables:  Pharmacokinetic variables to be determined include maximum plasma drug 
concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (Tmax) , area under the time -
concentration curve (AUC), and terminal half -life.   
Blood samples for PK analyses will be performed on Cycle 1, Day s 15-[ADDRESS_1281816] archival tissue.   
Pharmacodynamic studies as well as the concent ration of study drug (either 
BBI608 or BBI503) in tumors will be examined following study drug 
administration in patients with accessible tumors who consent to an optional on -
study biopsy. This optional biopsy will be obtained on Cycle 2, Day 1 5.   
Statis tical Methods:  
 Statistics will be descriptive in nature, and formal sample size calculations were 
not performed.     
Phase Ib:  
Central randomization will be performed whereby [CONTACT_912302] 1 (BBI608 plus sorafenib) or Arm 2 (BBI503 plus sorafenib) using block 
randomization.  Each block will be considered a cohort with [ADDRESS_1281817] one dose of study drug (either BBI608 or  BBI503) will be considered 
evaluable for safety analyses.  Adverse events will be assessed according to 
CTCAE and will be evaluated by [CONTACT_912303].  Adverse event listings 
and tabulated summaries of categorized adverse events will be generated f or all 
patients.  Vital signs, laboratory data, and ECG data will be summarized for 
changes over time on study.   
The pharmacokinetic population will be all treated patients in a given arm with 
sufficient data to determine pharmacokinetic parameters.   
Phase II:  
Approximately 90 patients (30/arm) were planned to be randomized in 1:1:1 
ratio into three treatment arms: Arm 1 (sorafenib plus BBI608), Arm 2 
(sorafenib plus BBI503), and Arm 3 (sorafenib alone) before Amendment [ADDRESS_1281818], Arm 2 in the Phase II portion was 
closed for enrollment and randomization is conducted in a 1:1 ratio to the two 
remaining arms: Arm [ADDRESS_1281819].  
Therefore, the total sample size of Phase II at the end of the trial is projected to 
be approximately 70 patients.  
Baseline characteristics as well as the obs erved safety, tolerability, and 
preliminary signs of anti -tumor activity will be summarized for each arm.

Phase Ib and Phase II:   
Anti-tumor activity will be summarized by [INVESTIGATOR_216].  Patients in a given study arm 
who have received at least one cycle of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) 
and who have had at least one disease assessment following the initiation of 
therapy will be considered evaluable for response.  
The anti -tumor activity will be evaluated on an exploratory basis and will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics or graphics. Patient response will be 
assessed based on sta ndard RECIST 1.1, as well as mRECIST for patients with 
HCC.  Data listings and summaries of tumor markers, imaging results, and

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: [ADDRESS_1281830] uncovered the presence of cancer stem cells (CSC s, also called tumor initiating cells , 
or cancer stem -like cells) which have self -renewal capability and are consid ered to be fundamentally 
responsible for malignant growth, relapse , and metastasis.  Importantly, CSCs are inherently resistant to 
conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Therefore, a targeted agent with activity against cancer stem cells for cancer 
patients is being exp lored (Clevers, 2011: Singh and Settleman, 2010; Lobo, Shimono et al . 2007; Boman 
and Wicha, 2008; please also find a list of reviews on CSCs in all major cancer types in the special issue of 
Journal of Clinical Oncology on cancer stem cells (J Clin Oncol.  2008 Jun 10;  26(17)).  
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary signs of activity of two different 
investigational agents designed as cancer stem cell inhibitors, BBI608 and BBI503, each administered in 
combination with sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  Sorafenib is an 
oral agent currently approved for the treatment of advanced HCC .  A combination regimen which targets 
the cancer stem cell population  in addition to the bulk tumor cells (non -stem c ancer cells)  may be an  
approach for this disease.   
The study agents, BBI608 and BBI503, are discussed subsequently .  Brief introductions to both agents are 
followed by [CONTACT_094] -clinical efficacy data and updates from  clinical development to date.  Additional 
information is available in the Investigator Brochures (IB) for both compounds.   
1.1.[ADDRESS_1281831] candidate selected from our BBI5600 program designed by [CONTACT_912304]. 
BBI503 may target cancer through inhibition of kinases that may be responsible for cancer stemness 
properties.   
1.2 Preclinical Efficacy  
1.2.1 BBI608  
Cancer stem cells are intrinsically resistant (more than 5 to 10 -fold than other tumor cells ) to 
chemotherapeutic drugs. BBI608 has activity (~100 to 500 nM) against cancer stem cells in vitro .  At the 
same time, BBI608 spares  normal hematopoietic stem cells (IC50 not reached at 30 μM)  in vitro .  
BBI608 has demonstrated in-vitro  activity in a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines derived from 
both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (IC50 ~100 nM to 500 nM).  
Further pre -clinical work in HCC cell lines has shown  that BBI608  is active in vitro against both bulk tumor 
cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs) derived from HCC cell lines .  Moreover,  there is evidence that  BBI608 
may act synergistically with sorafenib in vitro.   Figure [ADDRESS_1281832] bulk tumor cells, whereas Figure 2 shows that  BBI608 and BBI608 
with sorafenib re duces the ability of CSC s to form characteristic spheres in non -adherent stem cell media  
in vitro .

Confidential    Page: 18 and the cells remain viable.   Cancer stem cell markers such as CD133 and CD44 are reduced after treatmen t 
with BBI503.  Treatment with the combination of BBI503 + Sorafenib has also shown in vitro activity 
against CSC derived from HCC cell lines.   
 
Figure 3: BBI503 &  Sorafenib Sphere Form ation   
Single CSC cells were grown in suspension for 48 hrs. 
1µM BBI503 and 2 µM Sorafenib were added for 24 
hrs. Drug was removed, and cells were cultured another 
24 hours. DIC images were taken for the CSC sphere. 
Note: BBI503 compound is bright yellow, and is 
accumulated in CSC cells; blue is from Trypan Blue 
indicating dead cells.  
 
 
Additional  studies were performed on bulk cancer cells derived from HCC cell lines .  Compared with the 
CSC -enriched sphere culture, bulk cells contain mainly (~ 98%) non -CSCs. In Figure 4 below, t he 
combination of BBI503 and sorafenib may be synergistic in -vitro.  
Figure 4: BBI503 & Sorafenib Colony Formation  
 
Using Hep3B and Huh7 cell lines, 1000 cells per well were seeded in  6-well plate s. The n ext day, 
the cells were treated with BBI503 0.3 µM, sorafenib 2 µM, or the combination of both for 24 
hours.  After 24 hours,  the remaining cells were cultured in  fresh  medium  for 7 -10 days until 
visible  colonies formed . 
1.3 Safety and Antitumor Activity in Phase I  
1.3.1 BBI608  
A phase 1 dose escalation study (BBI608 -101) in adult patients with advanced cancer was initiated to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2  dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics and preliminary 
anti-tumor activity of napabucasin. A modified Simon accelerated titration scheme was used for dose 
escalation, with a cycle consisting of twice -daily oral administration of napabucasin for 4 weeks, and was 
repeated every 4 weeks (28  days) until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other 
discontinuation criteria were met.  

[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 19  
The dose of napabucasin was escalated from 20 mg to 2000 mg/day, and MTD was not reached  according 
to the protocol definition .  However, further dose escalation beyond 1000 mg/day was limited by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_912273]. In the [ADDRESS_1281833] common adverse events (regardless of 
reported causality) included diarrhea (83%), fatigue (62%), abdominal pai n (59%), nausea (56%), vomiting 
(52%), and anorexia (51%).  Grade 3 events included diarrhea (16%), fatigue (14%), abdominal pain (6%), 
dehydration (6%), and anemia (6%).  The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) was determined to be 500 
mg twice daily (1000 m g total daily dose).   The plasma concentration of napabucasin reached a mean 
maximal concentration of 843 ng/mL.  
BBI608 has also been combined with several chemotherapeutic agents to date.  The current safety and 
efficacy data are available in the IB  (version 6.3) .   
1.3.2 BBI503  
A phase 1 dose escalation study  (BBI503 -101) in adult patients with advanced cancer has been initiated to 
determine the safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics , and preliminary 
anti-tumor activity of BBI503. A modified Simon accelerated titration scheme was used for dose escalation , 
in which BBI503 was administered orally, once daily, twice daily, or three times daily in continuous 28 -
day cycles. Cycles were repe ated until progression of disease, unacceptable adverse events, or anther 
discontinuation criterion was  met.  
The dose of BBI503 has been escalated  from 10 mg to 600 mg total daily, and a MTD has not been reached  
according to the protocol definition .  Howe ver, f urther dose -escalation was limited by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_912274] (nausea, diarrhea).  BBI503 plasma concentration reach ed the in -vitro IC 50 
and pharmacokinetic parameters maximized at 300 mg to 400 mg total daily.  The putative re commended 
phase II dose for once daily dosing is 300 mg once daily and the putative recommended phase II dose for 
twice daily dosing is 200 mg twice daily (400 mg total daily).   
BBI503 observed adverse events have been predominantly mild to moderate gastr ointestinal disturbances.  
The most common events have been CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_1281834] included diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, and abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Adverse events can be managed with supportive care such as intravenous fluids and pharmacologic 
measures  targeting the specific symptom .  Dose -modification or hold ing of dosing until symptoms improve 
and/or resolve is recommended for moderate to severe symptoms .   
Please refer to the Investigator Brochure for additional clinical data .   
In summary, BBI503 has shown an manageable safety profile, favorable pharmacokinetics, and preliminary 
signs of antitumor activity.   
1.4 Combination Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
Advanced HCC remains a clinical challenge .  This is due to several factors, including the chemoresistant 
nature  of the disease, the toxicit y profile of currently available systemic chemotherapeutic agents , and the 
general poor health and  underlying liver dysfunction  of HCC patients (Kelley, R 2013).  The Sorafenib 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Protocol (SHARP) trial  remains the only randomized contr olled trial 
of a systemic chemotherapeutic agent to demonstrate a statistically significant survival benefit in patients 
with advanced, unresectable HCC  (Bruix , J 2012; Llovet , JM 2008) .  In that study, 602 patients were 
randomly assigned to receive sorafe nib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo . A median Overall Survival  (OS) 
of 10.7 mo nths was observed in the treatment arm  compared to 7.9 mo nths for placebo .  Time to Tumor 
Progression (TTP) for the sorafenib and placebo arms was 5.5 months and  2.8 mo nths, resp ectively .   
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: [ADDRESS_1281835]  in magnitude  (2.8 months 
increase in median survival) .  Many patients do not experience disease control, and disease control can be 
short -lived in those that do  achieve it with therapy.  Unfortunately, however, no other agent has proven 
more effective.  Recent phase III trials with other regimen s (FOLFOX, brivanib, sunitinib and linifanib; 
Qin, S et al, 2012; Johnson, PJ et al, 2013, Cheng, A et al 2011; Cianap, C et al, 2012 ) have all failed to 
demonstrate a statistically significant  improvement in OS when compared to treatment with sorafenib .   
There have also been multiple studies of combination therapy using sorafenib plus an additional agent  or 
regimen .  Few combinations, however, have progressed  for further evaluation in the phase III, pi[INVESTIGATOR_912275].  Those that have been evaluated in phase III trials , such as Brivanib , FOLFOX,  and Erlotinib, have 
failed to  demonstrate superiority to sorafenib alone.  Incre ased toxicity and poor quality of life were  
observed in the BRISK -FL study , and an increased incidence of hand -foot syndrome has been observed in 
combination studies with 5 -FU or 5 -FU derivative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [ Dig Dis Sci. 2012 May; 57(5): 1122 –1129 ].  
An unme t medical need exists for active systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_912276].

3.3 Number of Patients  
The number of patients enrol led on this study depends on the number of cohorts enrolled  in phase Ib  and 
the adverse events observed.  It is expected that approximately 6 to 12 patients will be enrolled in each arm  
during phase Ib dose-escalation, for 12 to 24 patients  total in phase Ib. After RP2D is determined for BBI608 
in combination with sorafenib and for BBI503 * in combination with sorafenib, enrollment to a randomized 
phase II portion of the study will begin.  A total of approximately 90 patients will be randomized to one of 
three study arms: sorafenib  in combination with BBI608 , sorafenib  in combination with BBI503 , or 
sorafenib alone , so that approximately 30 patients per arm  will be enrolled . Patient accrual will occur over 
a period of time dependent upon the enrollment rat e.  *Once the amendment [ADDRESS_1281842], there were approximate ly 10 
subjects enrolled in each of the three arms, and approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in each of the 
two open arms  (70 total for phase II) . 
The sample size for the phase II portion provides for an evaluation of tolerability, safety, and prelimi nary 
anti-tumor activity (see Section 10 and Section 10.5 for details).  Briefly, e nrollment will support an  
evaluation of the proportion of patients treated with combination therapy or with sorafenib alone who 
experience a grade 3 adverse event.  Enrollment a lso supports an evaluation of the proportion of patients 
treated with combination therapy or with sorafenib alone who a re alive and without progression at 4 months 
(16 weeks) after randomization . 
Non-evaluable patients for reasons unrelated  to the treatment will be replaced, such as subjects with 
exclusion criteria inadvertently randomized or subjects who withdraw for personal reasons .

4.1 Overall Study Design  
This is an open -label  Phase Ib /II study of oral study drug (BBI608 or BBI503) administered in combination 
with sorafenib to adult patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  The study will proceed 
initially as a phase Ib dose -escalation study, in which patients will be randomized  to receive escalating 
doses of either  BBI608 in combination with sorafenib  [phase Ib Arm 1],  or escalating doses of BBI503 in  
combination with sorafe nib [phase Ib Arm 2].  The phase Ib portion of the study is d esigned to determine  
the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for BBI608 plus 
sorafenib and of BBI503 plus sorafenib .   
When putative RP2D is determined fo r each study drug in combination with standard sorafenib  dosing  
according to the criteria for determination of dose -escalation and dose limiting toxicity per -protocol, the 
phase II portion of the study will begin.   
The phase II portion is a randomized, 3 -arm, open -label controlled study designed to compare the safety, 
tolerability , and preliminary anti -tumor activity in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
randomized to receive treatment with  either sorafenib  plus BBI608 [phase II Arm 1], sorafenib  plus BBI503  
[phase II Arm 2], or sorafenib alone [p hase II Arm 3 ].  In the phase II portion, BBI608 and BBI503 will be 
administered at their respective RP2D dose levels for administration with standard sorafenib  dosing  which 
were determined durin g the phase Ib portion  of the study .  Sorafenib will be administered at standard dose 
for both the phase Ib and phase II portions of this study.   
Note:  
Once the amendment [ADDRESS_1281843],  there were  approximately 10 subjects enrolled in Arm 2.  
Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in each of the two open remaining arms  (70 total for phase II) .   
During both the Phase Ib and Phase II portions of this study, objective (i.e. radiologic) disease assessments 
are required.  A baseline objective disease assessment is required  within 14 days of starting protocol 
therapy . Per -protocol objective disease assessments will be performed every eight weeks (56 days), as 
calculated according to the date of the first dose of protocol therapy on study .  A window of ±7 days is 
allowed when scheduling radiologic disease assessm ents (applies to each scan individually).  Clinically 
indicated radiologic evaluations outside of this schedule are allowed (see Section 5.7, Tumor Evaluation 
Visit s)  
4.[ADDRESS_1281844] label .  
The combination regimen  of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) plus sorafenib  will be administered in 
continuous 28 -day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation 
criterion is met.  
Sorafenib will be administered at a fixed dose of 400 mg twice daily (800 mg total daily dose).  This dose 
of sorafenib will be the same for each arm and for each dose -level cohort.  Sorafenib should be taken on an 
empty stomach, one hour prio r to or two hours after meals.  Sorafenib should not be taken with study drug, 
and at least 2 hours should separate a dose of sorafenib from a dose of study drug.

RP2D Determination  
In both Arm 1 and Arm 2, d ose escalation will proceed with the purpose of determining a recommended 
Phase 2 dose (RP2D) .  Dose escalation will proceed in each arm independent of the other arm.  The goal of 
dose escalation in Arm [ADDRESS_1281848] ug in combination with sorafenib is based on the 
adverse events observed and the criteria for determination of dose-escalation (dose -escalation decision 
rules ) in Table 1 below .  The criteria for determination of dose -escalation will be applied independently to 
each arm.

4.3 Design – Phase II  
The phase I I portion of the study will begi n when RP2D is determined for each agent in combination with 
sorafenib.  Patients enrolled into the phase Ib portion will not be eligible for enrollment into the phase II 
portion.   
The primary aim of the phase II portion is to evaluate the tolerability, safety, and preliminary anti -tumor 
activity in patients randomized to each  arm above.  Sorafenib is the current standard of care for patients 
with advanced HCC.  The evaluation of safety and activity planned for the phase II portion of this study 
will inform the design of further trials.  (see Section 10.5 in Section 10 for further details).   
The phase II portion of the study will require patients to meet the same inclusion and exclusion requirements 
as the phase Ib portion, which are outlined in Section [ADDRESS_1281852] for those patients who 
are eligible for enrollment.  Patient s will be centrally randomized in an open label fashion in a 1:1:1 ratio  
to one of the following three arms outlined in Table 2 below : 
Note:  
Once the amendment [ADDRESS_1281853], Arm 2 in the Phase II portion will be closed for enrollment due to 
BBI503 portfolio priorities and to increase efforts in enrolling patients on to Arm 1 and 3 .  
At the time of the amendment  3 there were  approximately 10 subjects enrolled in Arm 2,  therefore a total 
of approximately 70 patients will be enrolled in the phase II portion of the study, or  approximately 30 
patients will be enrolled in each of the two open remaining arms .

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 29 For patients enrolled to the phase II portion of the stu dy, p er-protocol objective (radiologic) disease 
assessments (see Section 5.7.2 ) should occur every 8 weeks (56 days) until disease progression is 
documented according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1281855] for HCC.  Protocol therapy may be continued in an 
open -label fashion until th e investigator determines that the patient is no longer deriving clinical benefit.  
If sorafenib is discontinued for any reason, study drug (BBI608 or BBI503) may be continued.  If a patient 
is randomized to Phase II Arm 1 or Phase II Arm 2, and study drug is permanently discontinued, patients 
will begin the follow -up portion of the  protocol  assessment schedule  (see Section 5.10), and may receive 
any further treatment  as determine d by [CONTACT_12707], including sorafenib.   Objective (radiologic) 
disease assessments  should continue to be obtained every [ADDRESS_1281856] for HCC.       
If RP2D for either BBI608 or BBI503 in combination with sorafenib is updated during the course of the 
phase II portion of the study, then patients randomized to that study arm will be administered study drug at 
the updated RP2D.  If needed, u p to 30 patien ts total may be enrolled in a study  arm at a given dose of study 
drug during the phase II portion of the study.   
 
 
 
4.4 Rationale for Study Design  
HCC is a global disease with a marked unmet medical need for effective systemic therapy.  The s cientific 
literature suggests that cancer stem cells may play a role in resistance to effective chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Th us, 
there is a strong rationale to clinically evaluate the addition of an agent which targets cancer stem cells to 
a therapy such as sorafenib which has  proven effectiveness in HCC.  
In addition to clinical safety and tolerability, p harmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data will be collected 
on this trial in order to establish the optimal dosing regimen for both BBI608 and BBI503 in combination 
with sorafen ib. The phase II portion will establish a body of evidence on which to base further clinical 
development.     
 
4.5 Selection of Dose  
The starting dose s of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) for phase Ib are based on clinical experience 
during the monotherap y phase I evaluation of both agents.  Doses were selected which were well tolerated 
as monotherapy, and which were well below the maximally administered dose for each agent.   
For the phase Ib portion, t he starting dose of BBI608 in combination with sorafe nib is 160 of BBI608  taken 
twice daily .  This is 33% of the BBI608 monotherapy RP2D  (480 mg twice daily, 960 mg total daily dose) , 
and 16 .7% of the maximally administered dose during the monotherapy phase I trial  (1000 mg twice daily, 
2000 mg total daily dose) .  Of note, MTD was not determined in the BBI608 monotherapy phase I dose -
escalation trial.  
The starting dose of BBI503 in combination with sorafenib is  100 mg once daily.  This is 33% of  the 
BBI503 monother apy once daily RP2D  (300 mg once daily) , and 16.7% of the maximally administered 
dose during the monotherapy phase I trial  (200 mg three times daily and 300 mg twice daily, or 600 mg 
total daily dose) .  Of note, MTD was not determined in the BBI503 monothe rapy phase I dose -escalation 
trial.   
The dose of BBI608 and of BBI503 * for the phase II portion of the study will be determined during the 
phase Ib portion of the study.  The sta rting dose for phase II Arm 1 ( sorafenib  plus BBI608 ) will be the 
RP2D of BBI608 in combination with sorafenib as determined during dose -escalation of phase Ib Arm 1.  
The starting dose for phase II Arm 2 ( sorafenib  plus BBI503 ) will be the RP2D of BBI503 in combination 
with sorafenib as determined during dose -escalation of phase I b Arm 2.

in combination with sorafenib at a compliance level of at least 80%  for the combination regimen .   
Compliance  for study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) and sorafenib is calculated by [CONTACT_912305][INVESTIGATOR_912280]  (see Section 7.4) .  The assigned dose 
of BBI608 or BBI503 is that determined by [CONTACT_121287] -level cohort  into which the patient is enrolled .  The 
assigned dose of sorafenib is the dose administered at the start of combination therapy , as determined during  
the [ADDRESS_1281858] of care are allowed .  Events meeting  DLT definition that occur during the sorafenib 
run-in period will not be considered DLT s.  Events occurring at any time that are determined to be due 
solely to sorafenib will not be considered DLT s.   
Enrollment at the next  dose level of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI03) and/or enrollment of additional 
patients into the ongoing cohort will be based on the tolerability and sa fety observed in evaluable patients, 
according to criteria described below:  
• If zero treated patients experience a DLT (defined below) by [CONTACT_2006] 28 of continuous daily dosing, 
then dose escalation will occur.  
• If one treated patient experiences a DLT (defined below) by [CONTACT_2006] 28 of continuous daily dosing, 
then an additional three patients will be enrolled for a total of six patients treated at the same dose 
level.  Escalation will occur if no additional DLTs are seen in that cohort (one of six patients).  
• If two o r more treated patients at a dose level experience a DLT  (defined below)  by [CONTACT_2006] 28 of 
continuous daily dosing, this will be the maximally administered dose.     
Once the maximally administered dose is determined, a  total of six patients will be treated at the previous 
dose level .

dose level s or an alternate administration schedule  may be assigned to a cohort after agreement between

4.7 Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as the occurrence of any of the following toxicities possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) or to study drug in combination 
with sorafenib during the first 28 days of combination therapy, unless there is a clear alternative 
explanation:   
• CTCAE (Common Te rminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 4 hematological  toxicity.  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia in the presence of active bleeding . 
• Grade 3 or 4 non -hematological toxicity, except for Grade 3 nausea/vomiting/anorexia, diarrhea, 
or fatigue , symptoms that will be considered DLT s only if they persist more than seven (7) days 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_3062] .  Grade [ADDRESS_1281859] 28 days of BBI608 
or BBI503 therapy in combination with sorafenib.  DLT s will be determined from both adverse events  and 
changes from baseline in physical examination findings and laboratory parameters.

Confidential    Page: 31 The criteria for determination of DLT s will apply to a given administrat ion schedule independently.  
Patients who discontinue protocol therapy for a reason other than  a DLT may be replaced in order to fully 
evaluate a given dose -level.   
 
4.8 Study Duration  
For both the phase Ib and phase II components of the study, p atients will receive treatment with combination 
therapy (either BBI608 or BBI503 * in combination with sorafenib)  until the investigator has determined 
that the patient is no longer likely to receive clinical benefit due to progression of disease, unaccepta ble 
toxicity , or another discontinuation criteri on (see Section 5.9).  It is expected that most patients will receive 
between one and four cycles of combination th erapy for a treatment period of 4 to 16 weeks.  It is expected 
that patient accrual for both the phase Ib and phase II portions of the trial will occur over a period of 12 -18 
months, with an additional 12 months to complete  follow -up.

5.7.2 Per-Protocol  
Per-protocol radiologic assessments will be performed every eight weeks (56 days), as calculated according 
to the date of the first dose of the sorafenib run -in period.  A window of ±7 days is allowed when scheduling 
radiologic disease assessments (applies to ea ch scan individually).  Per -protocol radiologic assessments are 
defined as a computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with 
tri-phasic liver scan.  For those with an allergic reaction to intravenous CT contrast de spi[INVESTIGATOR_912283] -
treatment measures, per -protocol evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and 
pelvis with gadolinium plus a non -contrast CT scan of the chest is required .   
Additional radiologic evaluations when clinically indi cated are allowed.  However, evaluations obtained 
for clinical indications cannot be substituted for per -protocol radiologic assessments unless they also satisfy 
the above per-protocol definition of radiologic assessment.    
Per-Protocol radiologic evaluations should be performed every 8  weeks (56 days) until radiologic disease 
progression is observed according to both RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1281879] for HCC.   
Patients with an imaging assessment whi ch meets criteria for either complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR)  according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1281880] to discontinue protocol therapy, the treating 
investigator should determine the likelihood that the patient will be able to attend the next scheduled 
radiologic assessment.  If the treating investigator feels it is unlikely that a patient will be able to obtain the 
next scheduled per -protocol radiologic assessment, a per -protocol radiologic assessment should be obtained 
as soon as possible (a minimum of 4 weeks , however, should elapse  between per -protocol assessments).   
Tumor response will be evaluated using the guidelines for Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST 1.1) and modified RECIST for pati ents with HCC.  Highlights of these guidelines are contained 
in Section 9.  
In general, for each radiologic imaging assessment obtained during the study, the following information 
and documentation is required:  
- Completed RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1281881] for HCC works heets  (provided by [CONTACT_2728]) that document  
lesion measurements and descriptions  
- De-identified, dictated, radiology report of the image (see Section 5.7.4 ) 
De-identif ied digital images and/or complete copi[INVESTIGATOR_912284] (see Section 5.7.4 ).   
5.7.3 Patient Disposition & RECIST Criter ia 
RECIST criteria serve to categorize clinical radiologic images.  RECIST categorization alone should not 
determine continuation or discontinuation of protocol therapy in a patient.  Given that both study drugs 
(BBI608 and BBI503) have a unique mechanism of action that target s cancer stem cells, study drug therapy 
may be continued in a patient who is clinically well but who meets criteria for “Progressed Disease” per 
RECIST (either RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1281882] for patients with HCC).  Continuation of study drug 
(either BBI608 or BBI503) therapy in this context is allowed provided that no further standard, approved

Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: [ADDRESS_1281883] guidelines 
will be documented in study Case Report Forms (CRFs).  For exploratory purposes, the Sponsor  may collect 
additional information from patient radiologic ima ges.  Examples of additional information include but are 
not limited to : de-identified radiology reports or dictations , digital copi[INVESTIGATOR_99606] -identified radiologic images , 
and/or complete de -identified image files.    
5.8 End of Study Evaluation  
For both phase Ib and phase II, a ll patients should be seen 14 to 30 days after discontinuation of protocol 
therapy .  This is the End of Study (EOS) visit.  The following assessments will be made during the end of 
study visit:  
• Physical examination  
• ECOG  performance status   
• Vital signs  (weight, temperature, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_34403])  
• Hematology (see Section 6.3) 
• Blood chemistry  (see Section 6.3)  
• Urinalys is (see Section 6.3) 
• Serum AFP  (see Section 6.3) 
• Assess Child Pugh Class  
• Tumor measurements and staging if radiologic progression has not yet been documented on study.  
That is, if a patient discontinues protocol therapy due to radiologic progression of disease, an End 
of Study imaging  assessment is not required.   
• Assess adverse events  
• Record concomitant medications  
Patients who are identified at the EOS visit as having persistent adverse events related to study drug (either 
BBI608 or BBI5 03) should continue to be followed on a monthly basis (or more frequently if clinically 
indicated) until resolution of study drug - related adverse events or until the AEs are deemed irreversible.    
Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur up to [ADDRESS_1281884] dose of study drug (either BBI608 
or BBI503) will be reported to the Sponsor  regardless of assessed causality (also see Section 8.2).   
5.9 Discontinuation from Study  
Patients may be removed from the study at any time if they meet any of the following criteria:  
• Progression of disease*  
• Noncompliance with any part of the study, as evaluated by [CONTACT_079]  [INVESTIGATOR_780615]  
• Patie nt request  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Lost to Follow -up despi[INVESTIGATOR_912285], Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: 39 • Clinically unacceptable adverse events despi[INVESTIGATOR_750200].  
• Death  
*Since study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) targets cancer stem cells, patie nts may continue study drug 
(either BBI608 or BBI503) administration with or without sorafenib beyond progression per RECIST  if the 
investigator concludes that  the potential clinical benefits  outweigh potential risks.  
5.9.1 Dates Associated with Discontinuation from Study  
The following clarifies important dates at the end of study treatment:  
Date of Last Dose:  The date that the last dose of study medication is taken (either BBI608 or 
BBI503).  The Date of Last Dose  does not necessarily need to be the Date 
Off Active Study.    
Date Off Active Study:  The date when both the patient and the investigator/study team understand 
the patient to be off of active protocol treatment.  In most cases, this will be 
the same as the Date of Last Dose ; however, it does not need to be the case.  
In addition, the Date Off Active Study  may not coincide with a formal study 
visit.   
End of Study Visit:  A formal study visit held [ADDRESS_1281885] Dose .   
5.10 Follow Up After Treatment Discontinuation  
For both the phase Ib and phase II portions of the study, the follow -up phase of the study will begin  after 
the EOS study visit has been completed .  Patients will be followed for specified clinical endpoints (both  
primary safety and secondary exploratory efficacy endpoint), and other important information such as post -
protocol therapy.    
As specified in Section 5.7.2 , per-protocol imaging (every 8 weeks/56 days) should continue until criteria 
for disease progression according to both RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1281886] for patients with HCC criteria.    
The clinical parameters and endpoints for follow -up after a patient permanently discon tinues study drug 
(either BBI608 or BBI503) administration are specified in table below, as is the recommended follow up 
frequency.  Follow -up and information collection is intended to be accomplished through review of the 
local medical record system by [CONTACT_912310]/or study CRAs -Monitors.  Contact [CONTACT_912311]/or primary care physician for a given patient may also be required.

7.3.2 Study Drug – BBI608 or BBI503  
The safety profiles of both BBI608 and BBI503 are well established.  The following dose -modification 
guidelines are based on clinical experience to date.   
During the dose-escalation  phase of the study , dose-modification of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) 
should adhere to the following guidelines:  
• For any intolerable Grade 2 or Grade 3 adverse events , the assigned dose of study drug (either 
BBI608 or BBI503) should be held.   
• If the adverse event  resolves to tolerable levels (must be ≤ grade 2 or at the baseline grade), dosing 
can resume at the assigned dose level with pharmacologic support measures administered .   
o Pharmacologic support measures for each study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) are 
provi ded in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  below.   
• If the adverse event takes longer than 5 days to resolve to tolerable levels (≤ grade 2 ) or to the 
baseline grade , or if the adver se event recurs upon resumed administration despi[INVESTIGATOR_912290], the dose may be reduced by [CONTACT_912313] s.   
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018  
Clinical Protocol BBI608 -503-103HCC  
Confidential    Page: [ADDRESS_1281900] dose -level and dose -reduction is required, a lower level can 
be determined by [CONTACT_54421] I nvestigator  and the medical monitor for the Sponsor .    
o A patient who requires dose -reduction is allowed to increase his or her dose back to the 
assigned dose -level with pharmacologic support.  
• Intra -patient dose escalation above the assigned starting dose -level is permitted, provided the 
increased dose -level has been determined safe according to the criteria for dose -escalation and 
determination of dose -limiting toxicity (Section 4.6).   
During the phase II portion of the study, and once RP2D is determined for a study drug (either BBI608 or 
BBI503) in combination with sorafenib, dose -modification can occur  according to the following guidelines:  
• For Grade 2 or Grade 3 gastrointestinal adverse events , or Grade 2 or Grade 3 fatigue , the assigned 
dose of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) may be reduced to a lower dose level with or without 
holding dose (a do se holiday).    
o When restarting study drug administration or when modifying to a lower dose -level, 
supportive pharmacology is to be administered as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  
o For a given patient who has reduced his or her dose, and for whom the new dose -level is 
well tolerated, the dose may be increased slowly, as tolerated, with supportive 
pharmacology measures as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  to a maximum dose of RP2D.     
• For all adverse events other than fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], dose 
modification is based  on tolerability as follows:  
o Dosing should be held for intolerable Grade 2 or Grade 3 adverse events until the event 
resolves to tolerable levels (≤ Grade 2).   
o If the above criteria are met, dosing can resume at a lower dose level with appropriate 
pharmac ologic support measures, if applicable.   
o If the lower dose level is well tolerated, the dose can be increased slowly, as tolerated, with 
supportive pharmacology if indicated, to a maximum dose of RP2D.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Specific Pharmacologic Recommendations - BBI608  and BBI503  
Recommendations for supportive pharmacology for adverse events that can be associated with BBI608 or

therapy is taken at a compliance level of greater than 80%.  The components of protocol therapy assigned 
will depend on what study arm the patient is randomized to , and whether the patient is randomized  during  
the phase Ib or phase II portion of the protocol.   
Compliance with sorafenib will be calculated using the following equation:  
% Compliance = Number  of capsules  actually  ingested  in a given  time  peri od
Number  of capsules  that  should  have  been  ingested* ×100 
*During the phase Ib portion of the study, the denominator of the compliance equation (t he number of sorafenib 
capsules  that should have been ingested ) refers to the dose of sorafenib administered a t the start of combination 
therapy .  During phase II, for patients randomized the sorafenib only arm [phase II Arm 3 ], the denominator of the 
compliance equation will refer to the dose of sorafenib administered on Cycle 1, Day 15.   
Compliance with study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503)  will be calculated using the following equation:  
% Compliance = Number  of capsules  or tablets  actually  ingested  in a given  time  period
Number  of capsules  or tablets  that  should  have  been  ingested  per dose  level ×100

[IP_ADDRESS]  BBI608  
No clinically apparent drug -drug interactions have been identified in patients administered  BBI608 , 
although a dedicated drug interaction study is currently ongoing  in healthy human volunteers .   
Napabucasin is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_2750] P450 isoform 1A2.  Therefore, caution should be 
exercised with drugs that are strong inhibitors or sensitive substrates of CYP1A2.  
Examples of strong 1A2 inhibitors and sensitive inducers are presented below:  
• Strong CYP 1A2 inhibitors: fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, zafirlukast  
• Sensitive CYP1 A2 substrates: alosetron, caffeine, duloxetine, melatonin, ramelteon, tasimelteon, 
theophylline, tizanidine  
Possible actions for investigators with patients taking medications as above include: discontinuing the 
medication entirely, continuing the medicat ion and monitoring for adverse effects, and continuing the 
medication at a reduced dose and monitoring for adverse effects.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  BBI503  
No clinically apparent drug -drug interactions have been identified in patients administered BBI503, 
although no dedicated studies have specifically evaluated potential interactions.  
 BBI503 was shown to have minimal in vitro  inhibitory activity against the individual CYP P450 isoforms 
1A2, 2D6, 2C19, 3A4, and 2C9 with IC 50s of ≥10 M for each isoform . In vivo inhibitory activity against 
these isoforms is expected to be > 1000 M, given that the majority of BBI503 (> 99%) is expected to be 
bound to plasma protein.  
In addition, in in vitro studies, BBI503 was not metabolized by [CONTACT_912315] P450 isofor ms tested ( 1A2, 
2D6, 2C19, 3A4, and 2C9 ).   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sorafenib  
Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers  on sorafenib  
Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, administered at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 5 days in combination 
with a single oral dose of Sorafenib  400 mg in healthy volunteers resulted in a 37% decrease in the mean 
AUC of sorafenib [see US approval label,  Clinical Pharmacology  Section  (12.3)] . Concomitant use of 
strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], dexamethasone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, 
rifabutin, and St. John’s wort , see Section 7.7.2  as well ) is prohibited in this study during the dose -
escalation phase because these drugs can decrease the systemic exposure to sorafenib.  
Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors  on sorafenib  
Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P -glycoprotein, administered at a dose of 400 mg once 
daily for 7 days did not alter the mean AUC of a single oral dose of Sorafenib  50 mg in healthy volunteers. 
However, for this protocol, use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is prohibited during the dose -escalation phase 
(see Section 7.7.2 ). 
Effect of sorafenib on Levels of Other Drugs  
sorafenib  400 mg twice daily for 28 days did not increase the systemic exposure of concomitantly 
administered midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), dex tromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), and omeprazole 
(CYP2C19 substrate) ( see sorafenib product label).   
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc   April 3, 2018

Confidential    Page: 53 Neomycin  
Neomycin administered as an oral dose of 1 g three times daily for 5 days decreased the mean AUC of 
sorafenib by 54% in healthy volunteers that had also been administered a single oral dose of sorafenib  [ADDRESS_1281903] not been studied (see 
sorafenib product label).  
Drugs that Increase Gastric pH  
The aqueous solubility of sor afenib is pH -dependent, with higher pH resulting in lower solubility. However, 
omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, administered at a dose of 40 mg once daily for 5 days, did not result 
in a clinically meaningful change in sorafenib single dose exposure. N o dose adjustment for sorafenib  is 
necessary  when administered with drugs that increase gastric pH .

AEs that are considered to be related to study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) or that occur  after any 
administration of study drug will be followed u ntil the event resolves.  AEs will be evaluated using the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE, Version 4.0, published [ADDRESS_1281905] dose  of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503)  and including the protocol -defined post -treatment

occur after signing of the informed consent but prior to the first do se on study  will not be reported as AEs *.  
It is also important to record all AEs , whether serious or non -serious,  that result in permanent 
discontinuation of the investigational product being studied . 
Serious adverse events (SAEs), as defined below, must be reported to [LOCATION_011] Biomedical Inc. or its 
representative within 24 hours of knowledge of their occurrence.

part of standard of care.   
8.1.[ADDRESS_1281906] ; the medical occurrence  does not need to have  a causal relationship 
to the pharmaceutical product .  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, regardless of whether  it is considered related to the medicinal product.  
Laboratory data  are to be collected as stipulated in this protocol and toxicity trends will be analyzed utilizing 
objective toxicity criteria.  Clinical syndromes rather than  laboratory abnormalities are to be recorded when  
appropriate (e.g., diabetes mellitus instead of  hyperglycemia).   
Progression of disease is considered an efficacy outcome parameter and should not be captured as an AE.  
A non -serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not meet any of the criteria for SAEs as 
defined below.  
Patients should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the investigator.  Investigators should 
assess the patient for AEs at each visit.  AEs occurring during the clinical trial and the follow -up period 
should be recorded on the appropriate AE CRF.  To capture the most potentially relevant safety information 
during a clinical trial, it is important that investigators  use accurate AE term inology  on CRFs.   
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and sy mptoms 
should be identified by [CONTACT_67442].  However, if an observed or reported sign 
or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_093], it should 
be recorded as a separate AE on the  CRF.  
Appropriate CTCAE term s for AEs should be used whenever possible.  If an appropriate CTCAE term is 
not available, then the verbatim term should be documented.

criteria --or correlated with neither set of criteria.  As such, it is r ecommended that the patient be treated 
clinically and that decisions regarding continuation or discontinuation of protocol therapy be made mainly 
based on clinical assessment; radiologic imaging should inform, but not be the primary determinant of, the 
decision to continue or discontinue therapy.  
Both sets of guidelines are briefly summarized in this section.  For a complete overview, please refer to the 
original publications.  Patient imaging while on study will be categorized according to both RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1281911] 1.1 definitions 
(outlined in Section 9.1.1 ).  For that lesion to then qualify as measurable according mRECIST, the lesions 
must also show intratumoral arterial enhancement on contrast -enhanced CT or MRI.   
Patients may enroll if they have at least measurable  disease per REC IST 1.1.  Please note, however, that 
since exploratory estimates of time to event endpoints such as TTP and PFS will be summarized using both 
methods, all patients should continue to be assessed on -study using both criteria (as progression according 
to mRE CIST can be documented even if there is no disease measurable per mRECIST at baseline).   
9.1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)

diameter 10 mm using conventional techniques or [ADDRESS_1281913] be [ADDRESS_1281914] diameter.  
Non-measurable lesions  - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm with 
conventional techniques, <[ADDRESS_1281915] scan or  lymph nodes  10 mm to <15 mm in short axis) . 
These small lesions can include bone lesions, ascites, pleural/pericardial effus ions, cystic lesions , and 
abdominal  masses that are not confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218].  
• All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique should b e used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
• External l esions  identified on physical exam  will be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes)  and when they ar e ≥ 10 mm when 
measured using calipers .  For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_912319] a measurement with a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.

• CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target 
lesions selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT and MRI should be performed 
with contiguous slices of [ADDRESS_1281917] should be performed using a 5-mm 
contiguous reconstruction algor ithm.  
• All imaging methods should be performed according to institutional standards , and  each 
patient should have a consistent method from baseline through the course of the study.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1281918] 1.1 Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” Lesions  
• All m easurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total with a maximum of 2 lesions 
per organ, representative of all involved organs , should be identified as target lesions  and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  
• Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_894669]).  
• A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions  (for lymph nodes, use short -axis) 
will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used 
as the reference from  which to characterize the objective tumor response.  
• All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions  and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required but the 
presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
• Importantly, pre -study images should be assessed by [CONTACT_5640] a member of the clinical 
investigativ e team at the study site or by a radiologist who is familiar with RECIST 
guidelines.  The image report is not sufficient for identification of lesions per RECIST.  
The images themselves should be assessed at baseline for measurable disease that can 
qualify  as target lesions.

Other key study objectives include the evaluation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (when 
biopsy is possible), and the evaluation of preliminary anti -tumor activity of each agent in combination with 
sorafenib.  The activity of sorafenib alone will a lso be evaluated in this study.     
Preliminary anti -tumor activity will be explored using different efficacy parameters.  Efficacy parameters 
which  involve disease progression as an endpoint will be generated twice: once using disease progression 
as defin ed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1, and again using disease progression defined by [CONTACT_912322].  This is 
because the two response evaluation criteria are different, and will produce different results for a given 
efficacy parameter.  The data accumulated on this trial wi ll help to determine whether the use of one 
approach over the other may be preferred in future trials of either BBI608 or BBI503 in hepatocellular 
carcinoma.   
Proportional efficacy parameters will be defined for both phase Ib, phase II, and combined accor ding to 
study arm.  The following parameters will be calculated for all  randomized patients and  for patients 
evaluable for response: Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of patients with best response 
of complete response (CR), Partial Res ponse (PR), or stable disease (SD) ; and O bjective response rate 
(ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) .  As above, DCR and ORR will be defined according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1281933] for HCC.     
The following time -to-event parameters will also be evaluated: time -to-progression (TTP), defined as the 
time from initiation of therapy until disease progression; and progression free survival (PFS)  defined as  
time from the initiation of therapy until disease progression or death from any cause .  Also,  as above, disease 
progression in both PFS and TTP will be defined according to both RECIST 1.1 and, in a separate analysis,

Confidential    Page: [ADDRESS_1281934] cancer stem cells, Disease -Specific Survival (DSS) and o verall 
survival (OS)  will also be evaluated.  DSS is defined as the time from initiat ion of therapy until death from 
hepatocellular carcinoma.  Overall survival is  defined as time from initiation of therapy until death from 
any cause.  Estimates of DSS and OS for each cohort will be displayed using Kaplan -Meier curves.   
Other evidence for  anti-tumor activity will be evaluated on an exploratory basis and will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics or graphics.  These may include but are not limited to: a summary of tumor 
marker values over time , a description of the duration of response  or duration of disease control, and 
summaries of the  proportion  with PFS, TTP, DSS, and OS,  at 3, 4, 6, and /or [ADDRESS_1281935] of baseline performance status, comorbidities, estimated 
portal pressure, or plasma IGF -1 levels on measures of clinical activity such as time to progression or 
progression free survival.   
10.5 Determination of Sample Size  
Phase Ib:   
The sample size for this study was determined by [CONTACT_787102].  With cohort 
sizes of three to six patients  during phase Ib , if the true underlying rates of DLT at a given dose -level are 
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, ther e will be 91%, 71%, 49%, 31%, and 17% chances, respectively, of escalating 
to the next full dose.  
Phase II:  
There are no statistical hypothesis testing and the sample size is considered to be clinically adequate to 
assess tolerability, safety, and prelimin ary anti -cancer activity of study drug of interest .  Estimation and 
95% confidence intervals will be provided for the proportion of patients with grade 3 adverse events by 
[CONTACT_3148], as well as for the proportion of patients that are alive and progression free 4 months (PFS -4) after 
randomization for each arm.  Other anti -cancer activity parameters will also be estimated  
10.[ADDRESS_1281936] one dose of study drug (either 
BBI608 or BBI503)  will be considered in the study drug safety population .  Safety and adverse events will 
be summarized for the study drug safety population of p hase Ib, phase II, and overall.   
During the phase Ib portion of the study, adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_2715] -level and overall by 
[INVESTIGATOR_216].  The numbers of patients enrolled, number with DLT, and number evaluable for determination of dose -
escalation at  each dose -level by [CONTACT_912323].  In addition to the evaluation and categorization of 
adverse events, listings of laboratory test results collected at baseline and during the study will be generated.  
Descriptive statistics summarizing the changes  in those laboratory tests over time will be presented.  
Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.0.  The incidence of adverse events 
will be evaluated for each cohort .  Patients will be followed for adverse events for at least [ADDRESS_1281937] dose of study drug (either BBI608 or BBI503) , or until they have recovered from all related study drug 
(either BBI608 or BBI503)  adverse events.  
Safety and adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_912324] n and for all enrolled 
patients during the phase II portion of the study.

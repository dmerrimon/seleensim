SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA204142
Protocol Title: A Phase 2, Multiple Cohort Study of Elotuzumab in Combination w ith Pomalidomide and Low-Dose 
Dexamethasone (EPd), and in Combination with Nivolumab (EN), in Patients with Multiple Myeloma Relapsed or 
Refractory to Prior Treatment with Lenalidomide.
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Du ration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s):
Elotuzumab: 10 mg/kg IV - Cycles 1 and 2: Days 1, 8, 15, 22
20 mg/kg IV - Cycle 3 and beyond: Day 1 of each cycle
Pomalidomide: 4 mg PO: Days 1 - 21 of each cycle
Dexamethasone: Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle:
•Subjects ≤75 years old: Weeks with elotu zumab dosing: 28 mg PO + 8 mg IV and 40 mg PO on non-elotuzumab 
dosing weeks
•Subjects > 75 years old: Weeks with elotuzumab dosing: 8 mg PO + 8 mg IV and 20 mg PO on non-elotuzumab 
dosing weeks
Nivolumab:
•Cycles 1 through 4: 240 mg IV Days 1, 15 of each 28-day cycle
•Cycles 5 and beyond: 480 mg IV Day 1 of each 28-day cycle
Study Phase: Phase 2
Research Hypothesis:
Elotuzumab/Pomalidomide/Low-Dose Dexamethasone Cohort (EPd) :
Elotuzumab in combination with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamet hasone will prolong progression-free survival 
(PFS) in subjects with multiple myeloma (MM) who have relapsed o r are refractory or intolerant to a 
lenalidomide-based regimen.
Elotuzumab/Nivolumab Cohort (EN):
The combination of elotuzumab and nivolumab will provide clinical benefit, represented by [CONTACT_30530], in patients 
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have rece ived at least 4 prior lines of therapy including a 
proteasome inhibitor (PI), immunomodulatory (IMID), and an anti-C D38 antibody.
Objectives:
Primary EPd Cohort Objective:
•To estimate the PFS in patients with MM treated by [CONTACT_317407] d- or third-line regimen after relapse or being 
refractory or intolerant to a prior lenalidomide based regimen.
Primary EN Cohort Objective:
•To estimate the Objective Response Rate (ORR).

Study Design:
This i
s a Phase 2, multi-center, open-label, multiple cohort stu dy of elotuzumab in combination with pomalidomide 
and low dose dexamethasone (EPd Cohort) and elotuzumab in combina tion with nivolumab (EN Cohort) to assess the 
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy for treatment of relapsed or refractory MM patients. 
Approximately 120 subjects  will be screened in this study to treat a  minimum of 60 subjects in the EPd Cohort and 
approximately 30 subjects in the EN Cohort. Screen failure rate is approxima tely 25%. Per Re vised Protocol 03, the 
EPd cohort is closed to enrollment.The estimated duration of enrollment is [ADDRESS_390613] minimal response ( ≥MR) 
after 2 cycles of treatment or do not achieve an objective response ( ≥PR) after [ADDRESS_390614] has clinical benefit from the treatment and do not meet criteria 
for discontinuation.

Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size: 
EPd Cohort: 
Per Revised Protocol 03, the EPd cohort is closed to enrollment . Screening continued until a minimum of 60 patients 
were enrolled and treated. This total number is based on logistic al consideration with statistical properties outlined 
below.Under the assumptions that:
•time to progression-free survival is exponentially distributed
•median time of progression-free survival of 11 months among sub jects treated with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone and will increase to a median of 15 months when elotuzumab is added to the mix
•an increase of 4 months in med ian corresponds to relative risk ratio of 0.73 (0 .0462 monthly risk in the elotuzumab 
add on a nd 0.0630 monthly historical risk in the pomalidomide + dexamethasone treated subjects)
Sixty subjects enrolled over a 24-month period are sufficient t o detect an increase in median from 11 to 15 months 
with about 70% power in a one-sided test with a 0.[ADDRESS_390617] s; screening will continue until a minimum of 
30 patients are enrolled and treated. For a 30% observed ORR rat e, a sample size of N=[ADDRESS_390618] confidence 
interval of [0.15, 0.49]. These design parameters ensure a lowe r bound higher than 15 %
Endpoints:
Primary EPd Endpoint:
PFS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date o f the first documented progression per IMWG uniform 
criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subj ects who die without a reported prior progression will 
be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Sub jects who did not progress or die will be censored on 
the date of their last evaluable assessment. Subjects who did no t have any on study efficacy assessments and did not 
die will be censored on the first dosing date.
Subjects who switched to subsequent therapy prior to documented  progression will be censored on the date of the last 
evaluable assessment prior to the initiation of the new therapy . 
Primary EN Endpoints
ORR is defined as proportion of subjects with best overall response of partial response (PR) or better. Response will 
be determined per IMWG uniform criteria.
Secondary EPd Endpoints
•Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of su bjects with a best overall response of partial 
response (PR) or better
•Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of death from any cause. A subject 
who has not died will be censored at last known date alive.

Analyses
Demographics 
and Baseline Characteristics: The demographic and baseline characteristics of patients in the safety 
analysis set will be presented. 
Efficacy Analyses: The efficacy e ndpoints, progression free survi val and objective response rate (ORR), will be 
defined using the International Myeloma Working Group criteria.  Responses will be assessed at every treatment cycle 
using central laboratory test results on myeloma urine and serum, local laboratory bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_317392], and if 
needed bone marrow and skeletal survey results and CT/MRI assessments. Objective responses will include stringent complete response, complete response, very good partial response and partial responses. The objective response rate and its 95% c onfidence interval (CI) using the Clopper-Pearson estimation pr ocedure will be reported. Progression 
free survival and overall survival will be plotted using Kaplan -Meier estimates, and if estimable, median and its 95% 
CI will be reported.  
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 08-Mar-[ADDRESS_390619] dose of nivolumab. The frequency, severity, relat ionship to combination of drug treatment, seriousness, 
and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) will be reported for the full safety analysis set. AE severity w ill be graded 
according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 3.0. Results of targ eted physical 
examinations p rior to each dosing cycle will be presented. Summary statistics on vital signs at sc reening,  pre-infusion, 
30 minutes after the start of infusion, at end of infusion and 30 minutes after the completion of infusion will be re ported 
for Cy cle 1 and pre-i nfusion for Cycle 2 and beyond. Concomitant medications, SAEs, a nd performance status prior 
to dosing will be presented. The safety analysis set will be used for reporting safety /adverse events.
Biomarker Analyses
No biomarker analysis is planned for the EPd Cohort. In the EN Cohort, the potential association between PD- L1 
expression and clinical efficacy measures, such as overall response, will be assessed using methods such as Fisher’s 
exact test if sample size is large enough to allow meaningful a nalysis or other methodology as appropriate.

Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
The American Cancer Society has estimated 30,[ADDRESS_390625] improved overa ll and event-free survival, the 
majority of patients with my eloma will relapse  and disease progression is expected for all but a 
small percentage.5The subjects enrolled in the EP d trial will receive an anti-myel oma regimen of 
pomalidomide + dexamethasone wh ich demonstrated improvements in PFS, OS, and overall 
response in patients with refractory or relapsed and refractory  multiple myeloma, including 
patients with disease refractory to both bortezomib and lenalid omide.29Pomalidomide has gained 
U.S. FDA accelerated approval and EMA approval in this populati on of MM patients at a dose of 
[ADDRESS_390626] to that observed  with lenalidomide. The 
expectation is that subjects in this trial will derive clinical  benefit.
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 08-Mar-[ADDRESS_390627] ®REMS ( Section 4.3.3 ). 
Subjects may also follow Pomalidomide Pregnancy Risk Prevention  Pl a n  ( Appendix 6 ) where 
applicable. All investigators and subjects must fully comply wi th and participate in the distribution
program in order to participate in this trial.
Elotuzumab as monotherapy or in combination with immunomodulato ry agents such as 
thalidomide or lenalidomide is well tolerated. Safety data from  an interim analysis of the ongoing 
randomized phase 3 study of lenalidomide and dex amethasone with or without elotuzumab in 
patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (Eloquent  2) has shown that elotuzumab 
was well toler ated in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, with minim al incremental 
toxicity and no new safety signals. The safety profile of elotu zumab was consistent across IMiD 
combination studies (thalidomide and lenalidomide). As pomalido mide is an analogue of 
thalidomide, a similar safety profile is expected when pomalidomide + dexamethasone is 
combined with elotuzumab. Key elotuzumab adverse events have be en infusion related events.[ADDRESS_390628] all been managed by [CONTACT_317408] 24 hours. The frequency 
and intensity of infusion related adverse events has been mitig ated with premedications, including 
corticosteroids, histamine-1 and -2 antagonists, and acetaminop hen. Guidelines for the 
management of infusion reactions  are also provided in this prot ocol (See Section 4.5.5 ).
Nivolumab is approved in multip le solid tumor indications and h ematologic malignancies 
(eg, classical Hodgkin lymphoma) based on its favorable benefit/ risk assessment. In hematological 
malignancies including multiple myeloma, nivolumab monotherapy was generally well tolerated 
and toxicity profile was similar to that observed in solid tumo rs. Nivolumab has the potential for 
clinically relevant uni que AEs potenti ally caused by [CONTACT_317409]. These include 
pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, diarrhea/colitis, endocrino pathies, and nephrotoxicity. To date, 
these unique AEs have been manageable with frequent monitoring,  prompt diagnosis, and 
initiation of corticosteroids, dose interruption, and adequate supportive care. The management 
algorithms  of the immune-related AEs are included in Appendix 7. 
Because nivolumab and elotuzumab have non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_317394], the combination of 
both drugs is not expected to increase toxicities. 
Elotuzumab combination with nivolumab is an experimental therap y and it is possible that 
unforeseen or unanticipated adverse events may occur although bo th agents have been evaluated 
separately in combination wit h other agents in multiple myeloma and have known toxicity profiles.
In order to min imize the overall risks to participating subjects, the protocol  has inclusion-exclusion 
criteria appropriate to the population, and specific follow-up safety assessments. Adverse events 
and serious adverse events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis  by [CONTACT_317410]’s pharmacovig ilance group to look for trends and safety  concerns. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_317395]. T reatment options in this later line 
relapsed/refractory myeloma s etting are limited and it is possi ble that this combination may 
provide clin ical benefit to patients.

2. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
2.1 Good Clinical Practice
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical P ractice (GCP), as defined by [CONTACT_20417] (ICH) and in accordan ce with the ethical principles 
underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the United S tates Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50).
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. Th e protocol and any amendments 
and the subject informed consent w ill receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorabl e opi[INVESTIGATOR_122339].
All potential serious breaches must be reported to BMS immediately. A serious breach is a breach 
of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the protocol, which is 
likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physica l or mental integrity of the subjects of 
the study or the scientific value of the study.
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.This study will not use the services of study personnel where sa nctions have been invoked or where 
there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medic al licensure, debarment).
2.[ADDRESS_390629]/Independent Ethics Committee
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and  dated approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_20291]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recrui tment materials (eg,
advertisements), and any other written information to be provid ed to subjects. The investigator or 
BMS should als o provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the  Investigator Brochure or product labeling 
information to be provided to subjects and any updates.
The investigator or BMS should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other information 
(eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative le tters) according to regulatory 
requirements or institution procedures.

risks, and other critical issues regardi ng clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.
In situations where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives 
(as per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed a bout the purpose, po tential risks, and 
other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the s ubject volunteers to participate.
BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Loca l) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements required by [CONTACT_12212], G CP and applicable regulatory 
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 08-Mar-[ADDRESS_390631]:
1) Provide a copy of the consent form and written information abo ut the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study pa rticipation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily understood.
2) Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally accepta ble representative to inquire about 
the details of the study.
3) Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_29159]'s legally 
acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_28490].
4) Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_8598] e written informed consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior  to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.
5) If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of makin g and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionall y be obtained from the subject.
6) Revise the informed consent whenever important new informatio n becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a perso n designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully i nform the sub ject or the subject' s legally accept able representative or legal 
g u a r d i a n ,  o f  a l l  p e r ti n e n t  a s p e c t s  o f  t h e  s t u d y  a n d  o f  a n y  n e w  information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study. T his communication should be 
documented.
The confidentiality o f records that could identify sub jects must be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements , the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and reg ulatory authorities have direct 
access to subject records.
Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or sub jects with or severe dementia) may 
only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acceptable representative. The subject 
must also be informed about the nature of the study to the exte nt compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or she should personally sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The exp licit wish of a  subject who is unable t o give his or 
her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] a nd assessing information to refuse 
participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time s hould be considered by 
[CONTACT_093].
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are th e most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.

3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
A Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any fem ale who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hyst erectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined a s [ADDRESS_390655] imulating hormone, (FSH) level 
> 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
*Females treated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT)  are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a  physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the inves tigators should use their judgment 
in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is > 40 mIU /ml at any time during the 
washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal:

restarted at 0.5 mL/minute. If symptoms do not recur after 30 m inutes, the infusion r ate may be 
increased in a stepwise fashion (0.5 mL/minute every 30 minutes)  to the rate at which the infusion 
reacti on occurred. If no rec urrence of the infusion reaction, the escalation regimen can be  resumed. 
Subjects who experience an infusion reaction require vital sign s to be monitored every 30 minutes 
for 1 or 2 hours after the e nd of the elotuzumab infusion (as clinically indicated). If the elotuzumab 
infusion reaction recurs, the infusion must be stopped and not restarted on that day. Appropriate 
therapy should be administered to address the subject’s signs a nd symptoms. The infusion can be 
reattempted at the next protocol defined i nfusion time point at the investigator’s discretion with 
additional premedication as described throughout Section [IP_ADDRESS]

as an SAE if it meets the criteria. Infusion reactions s hould be graded acc ording to NCI CTCAE 
(Version 3.0) guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modifie d based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms: (mild reaction; infus ion inte rruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):
•Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from sympt oms. The following 
prophylactic prem edications are recomme nded for future i nfusions: diphe nhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_390696] 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction required therapy or infusion inter ruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment (eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inf lammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for 
≤24 hours):
•Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal sal ine, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/p aracetamol 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid 
and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appro priate. If the infusion is 
interrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, th e rate may be increased to 100% 
of the original infusion rate. M onitor subject closely. If symptoms recur, then no further 
nivolumab will be administered at that visit.
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equi valent) and/or acetaminophen/para cetamol [ADDRESS_390697] 30 minutes before nivolumab inf usions. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of Sol uCortef or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (severe reaction, Grade 3: prol onged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_86025]/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following 
initial improv ement; hospi [INVESTIGATOR_317399] (eg, renal impairment, 
pulmonary infiltrates). Grade 4: Life-threatening; pressor or v entilator support indicated):
•Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infu sion of normal saline and 
treat the subject as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1000 
solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000 solution injected 
slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV wi th methylprednisolone 
100 mg IV (or equiv alent), as needed. Subject should be monitored un til the Investigator is 
comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be  permanently discontinued. 
Invest
igators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. 
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery of the sym ptoms.

4.5.7 Management Algorithms for Immune Related Adverse Events
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can d iffer in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by [CONTACT_20451]. Nivolumab is cons idered an immuno-oncology agent 
in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs assoc iated with immuno-oncology 
agents may mitigate severe toxici ty. Management Algorithms have  been developed to assist 
investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathy
•Skin
•Neurological
The above algorithms are found in Appendix 7 and in the nivolumab Investigator Brochure.
4.5.8 Dose Delay, Interruption, or Discontinuation for All Subjects
Please refer to Sections [IP_ADDRESS] , [IP_ADDRESS] , [IP_ADDRESS] , and [IP_ADDRESS] for drug-specific delay guidance.
For each cohort, if the dose of one drug in the regimen (ie, po malidomide, dexamethasone, 
nivolumab, or elotuzumab) is delayed, interrupted, or discontin ued, the treatment with the other 
drugs may continue as scheduled. However, in the EPd cohort, if  dexamethasone is delayed or 
discontinued discuss ongoing elotuzumab administration with the  Medical Monitor. Subjects 
experiencing a 56 day delay in all study drugs due to an advers e event(s) related to study treatment 
must be discontinued from study drug. Subjects experiencing del ays unrelated to study therapy, 
for example due to radiation therapy, may delay study treatment after discussio n with the medical 
monitor.
Each cycle is 28 days. While dose delays or in terruptions are permitted, the start of each cycle 
cannot be delayed and is fixed (ie, anchored) relative to Cycle  [ADDRESS_390698] be 
discontinued for an adverse event or other reason. Patients are  considered still on study therapy 
even if they continue solely on pomalidomide, dexamethasone, or  nivolumab.

5.4 Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy endpoints will be based on a nalysis of serum and urine  electrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP), 
sFLC (for those with sFLC disease only), corrected calcium (serum calcium and serum albumin), 
imaging and bone marrow assessments, all at predefined intervals as specified in Table 5.1-[ADDRESS_390787] will be based o n central 
lab results, whereas assessments of bone marrow, bone lesions, extramedullary plasmacytomas, 
and corrected calcium will be based on local analysis at the si te.
5.4.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment
Response criteria according to guidelines of the modified IMWG33,34(Appendix 4 ) will be used 
for the primary analysis. For the purposes of this study, all s ubjects’ tumor assessments by 
[CONTACT_317423] d be re-evaluated per the protoco l-stated frequency relative to the 
date of first dose of study drug until disease progression base d on the modified IMWG criteria, 
irrespective of dose delays or treatment cycle. If subject does not have documented disease 
progression at time of study drug discontinuation, then tumor a ssessments should still be 
performed according to the same schedule described above until disease progression. 
Subjects will be followed for surv ival at least once a year by [CONTACT_317424].
All efficacy laboratory assessments should be done through the central laboratory, except corrected 
calcium (serum calcium and serum albumin), and bone marrow asse ssments for plasma cell 
percentage and light chain restriction (clonality by [CONTACT_317425] w cytometry). Only if a subject is 
unable to come to the site for a visit to have specimens collected for a central lab (especially after 
study drug discontinuation), a SPEP, UPEP, or sFLC assessment can be performed locally, in lieu 
of a central lab assessment. M protein quantificati on or Serum Free Light Chain (sFLC) must be 
performed. Any laboratory samples analyzed locally, including f or efficacy, must be entered on 
the appropriate CRF/eCRF.

CR/sCR is mandatory, that is negative urine immunofixation is required to fulfill CR/sCR criteria, 
even in subjects with non-measurable values at baseline. Theref ore, when serum immunofixation 
electrophoresis (SIFE) becomes negative, UPEP and urine immunofixation electrophoresis (UIFE)collection s hould begin for these subjects. In addition, a UPEP should be c ollected if clinically 
warranted (for example, signs of disease progression (eg, anemi a) even when SPEP M-protein is 
stable).

b) All other serum tests will be followed at each tumor assessme nt. Confirmation of ≥PR is 
required on 2 consecutive assessments.

Imaging Assessments for Myeloma
[IP_ADDRESS] Skeletal Imaging
Skeletal imagi ng, by [CONTACT_317426], for bone lesions will be 
performed within [ADDRESS_390790] scan (ie, of the s pi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) or MRI bone survey is 
acceptable. If imaging is performe d on treatment for assessment  of progression, the site must use 
the same modality of imaging as used in screening.
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Extramedullary Plasmacytoma
Computed tomography or MRI should be  performed at screening, if  clinically indicated, to assess 
for extramedullary plasmacytoma. To minimize unnecessary radiation in myeloma subjects where 
progression is primarily based on serum and urine M-protein, on  study assessments should only 
be performed if clinically indicated (ie, pain, concern for dise ase progression), whether or not 
present at baseline, and at the time of CR/sCR assessment.
A sum of the products of the longest diameters and longest perp endicular di ameter for all 
measurable lesions  will be calcu lated at screening. This sum will be used as the reference for on 
study assessments by [CONTACT_14218].
All tumor measur ements must be made in millimeters. All documented measurable l esions are to 
be followed throughout the trial. All assessments to be used fo r tumor response evaluation,

for well-defined lesions surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. Clinical e xamination is only acceptable when 
lesions are superficial, such as a skin nodule or palpable lymp h node. Skin lesions must be 
documented by a photograph with a ruler. Ultrasound is not acce ptable for documentation of

5.8.1 Pharmacogenomic/Pharmacogenetic Assessments
Genetic assessment (FISH) of myeloma cells is optional and will b e performed by a central 
laboratory on the fresh bone marrow, during the screening perio d. If a fresh aspi[INVESTIGATOR_317403], but local genetic assessment has been performed, the se results must be entered into the 
CRF/eCRF. This assessment is considered to be standard of care for myeloma. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_317404]: t(4;14), t(14; 16), 
t(11;14), t(6;14), t(14;20), 1q gains/amp, del(17p), del(1p), and del(13).
6. ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subje ct administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treat ment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (s uch as an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom , or disease 
temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or no t considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physic ian and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The causal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between stud y drug administration and the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and 
the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is eviden ce to suggest a causal relationship.
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs. )
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically m ight have caused death if it were 
more severe)
•requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20345] (see NOTE
below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Clinical Protocol CA204142
BMS-901608 elotuzumab
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the  definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is  also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or  nonpathogenic) via the study d rug 
is an SAE.
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced  liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be h andled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy (eg, d eath is an 
endpoint, if death o ccurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis mus t be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE :
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193581] c linical studies:
•a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24  hours, that does not result in 
admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threa tening event)
•elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
•admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical proce dure
•routine h ealth assessment requiring admissio n for bas eline/trending of h ealth status (eg, routine 
colonoscopy)
•medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth a nd planned prior to entry into the 
study. Appropriate documentati on is required i n these cases
•admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health s tatus 
and requires no medical/surgical inte rvention (eg, lack of housi ng, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason) .
•admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absen ce of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology protocols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 a n d  5.6.2 in  the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safety 
Information to det ermine e xpectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether relat ed or not 
related to study dru g, must b e collected, including those thought to be associated with prot ocol-
specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur duri ng the screening period and within 
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 08-Mar-[ADDRESS_390795] b e collected that relate to any later 
protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy).
The Investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these ti me periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.An SAE report must be completed for any event where doubt exist s regarding its seriousness.
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to stud y drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative  section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnan cies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within [ADDRESS_390796] be recorded on the  SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregna ncy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting co llection is t hrough the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back-up option when t he eCRF system is not functioning.
In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email o r confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number:  Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. In the event the el ectronic system is unavailable for transmission, 
paper forms must be used and submitted immediately. When paper forms are used, the original 
paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
[CONTACT_20491].
If only limited information is i nitially available, follow-up r eports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.)
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy drug or if n ew information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted  within 24 hours to BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the in itial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.

Nonserious AE information s hould also be collected from the start of a p lacebo lead-in peri od or 
other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuati on of study drug and for those pre sent at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and  described on the nonserious AE 
page of the CRF/eCRF (paper or electronic).
Completion of supplemental CRF/eCRFs may be requested for AEs a nd/or laboratory 
abnormalities that are reported /identified during the course of  the study.
6.[ADDRESS_390799] result abnormalities s hould be captured on the nonserious AE 
CRF/eCRF page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subjec t to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnorm ality that required the subjec t to receive specific corrective 
therapy.

ovulatory cycle (30 days) for a total of [ADDRESS_390801] administration (female study 
subjects); or plus one spermatogenesis cycle (90 days) for a to tal of [ADDRESS_390802] 
administration (female partners of male study subjects), the in vestigator must immediately notify 
the BMS Medical Monitor/designee of this event and comp lete and forward a Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form to BMS Designee within [ADDRESS_390803] cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose 
tapering if necessary for subject safety).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study drug after a thorough discussion 
of benefits and risk with the subject.
The investigator must immediately notify the BMS (or designee) Medical Monit or of this event 
and complete and forward a Pre gnancy Surveillance Form to BMS ( or designee) w ithin 24 hours

reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)Specific criteria for identifying potential DILI have not been identified for this protocol. Standard 
medical pract ice in identifyi ng and monitoring hepatic issues should be followed.
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:
1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (UL N)
AND
2) Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_390805], without initial findings of ch olestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase)
AND
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation  and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing ch ronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
Wherever possible,  timely confirmation  of initial liver-rel ated laboratory  abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occ urrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physica l examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required o r not required by [CONTACT_61892] a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, and standard deviation; minimum, maximum or 
interquartile range) will be provided for the safety analysis and by [CONTACT_317428] (2L/3L) groups. Because the s ample size for the  study is small, 
summary statistics with their associated 95% confidence interva ls and tests of hypotheses will be 
based, to the extent possible, usi ng small-sample statistics li ke the Clopper-Pearson for binomial 
data. Median time-to-event and its 95% confidence interval will  be based on the Kaplan-Meier 
(KM) estimatio n procedure. The KM curves will be presented for time-to-event endpoints.
8.1 Sample Size Determination
8.1.1 EPd Cohort 
Seventy-two subjects w ill be screened with a pproximately 17% projected to fail screening. This 
total number is based on logistical consideration with s tatist ical properties outlined below. 
Screening will continue until a minimum of 60 subjects are enro lled and treated.
Under the assumptions that:
•time to PFS is exponentially distributed
•median time of PFS is 11 months  for subjects treated with pomal idomide + dexamethasone 
and will increase to median of 15 months with the addition of e lotuzumab to the treatment mix
•an increase of 4 months in median corresponds t o relative risk rati o of 0 .73 (0.0462 monthly 
risk in the elotuzumab add-on and 0.0630 monthly historical ris k in the pomalidomide + 
dexamethasone treated-subjects)
Sixty subjects enrolled over a 24-month period are sufficient t o detect an increase in median from 
11 to 15 months with about 70% power in a one-sided test with a  0.[ADDRESS_390806] s; screening will continue until a 
minimum of 30 patients are enrolled and treated. 
For a 30% observed ORR rate and a sample size of N=[ADDRESS_390807] confidence interval of
[0.15, 0.49]. These design parameters ensure a lower bound high er than 15%.

8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
[IP_ADDRESS] EPd CohortPFS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the d ate of the first documented progression 
per IMWG uniform criteria or death  due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who die 
without a reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their 
death. Subjects who did not progress or die will be censored on  the date of their last evaluable 
assessment. Subjects who did not have any on study efficacy assessments and did not die will be 
censored on the first dosing date. 
Subjects who switched to subsequent therapy prior to documented  progression will be censored 
on the date of the last evaluable assessment prior to the initi ation of the new therapy.

APPENDIX 3 PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF ELOTUZUMAB
Note: Subjects must be premedicated as described in Section 4.5.[ADDRESS_390823] be co mpleted within 8 hours if kept at 
room temperature (25 °C). In the [LOCATION_002] and Puerto Rico, where a shortage of n ormal 
saline has been reported, dextrose 5% water (D5W) may be used. Normal saline is the preferred 
diluent and D5W shoul d only be used if nor mal saline is  not ava ilable. If a delay is anticip ated 
after the dose has been diluted  in normal s aline, the prepared dose (properly identified) may be 
refrigerated at 2 °C to 8 °C for up to 24 hours . If stored under refrigerated conditions, the study 
drug solution should be equilibrated to room temperature (takes  about 2 to 2.5 hours), and the 
container must be gently inverted to thoroughly mix the content s before administration. If the 
storage time limit is exceeded, the prepared dose solution must  be discarded and the reason 
documented by [CONTACT_317433] r ecords.
Elotuzumab will be administer ed to each subject as an IV i nfusion, using an automated infusion 
pump set at the appropriate rate according to the dose administr ation section (see Administration 
Instruction section below). The dose of elotuzumab will be calc ulated using the subject’s predose 
weight on Day 1 of each cycle (the screening weight can be used for Cycle 1 dose calculation), 
and then added to 0.9% saline for infusion.
Reconstitute elotuzumab lyophilized study drug, as described in steps 1 to 5 .
Step 1:  For a 440 mg vial of lyo philized elotuzumab, draw 17 m L of Sterile Water for Injection 
(SWFI), USP into a syringe equipped with an 18-gauge or smaller  needle.
Step 2:  Remove the flip-top from the elotuzumab vial.Step 3:  Place the vial upright on a f lat surface a nd, using standard aseptic techniques, insert the 
syringe needle into the vial through the center of the rubber st opper and deliver 17 mL (into the 
20-mL vial containing 440 mg elotuzumab) SWFI, USP, into the vi al. Slowly remove the syringe 
needle out of the vial. The final volume of the reconstituted s olution is approximately 17.6 mL, 
which includes the volume displaced by [CONTACT_317434]. The conc entration of elotuzumab in the 
reconstituted solution is approximately 25 mg/mL.Step 4:  DO NOT SHAKE. Hold the vial upright and gently swirl t he solution by [CONTACT_317435]. Then gently invert the v ial a few times in order to dissolve any 
powder that may be present on top of the v ial or the stopper. Finally, hold the v ial upright again 
and gently swirl the solution a few more times to dissolve any remaining particles. Avoid 
prolonged or vigorous agi tation. DO NOT SHAKE.  
Step 5:  After the remaining solids are completely dissolved, a llow the reconstituted solution to 
stand for [ADDRESS_390824] small bubbles and/or foam around the e dge of the vial. The reconstituted 
preparation results in a colorless to slightly yellow, clear to  slightly opalescent solution 
containing approximately 25 mg/mL of elotuzumab.

Step 6:  Once the reconstitution is completed, withdraw the cal culated drug volume and further 
dilute with 100-500 ml of normal saline into an infusion bag (s ee Pharmacy Manual for 
additional details). The volume of saline or D5W can be adjuste d so as not to exceed 5 mL/kg of 
patient weight at any given dose of elotuzumab. The resulting e lotuzumab concentration must be 
from 1.0 mg/mL to 6.0 mg/mL. Elotuzumab solutions are compatibl e with polyvinyl chloride 
and polyolefin bags. Examples of such bags include Viaflo, Maco Pharma Easyflex N, Macoflex 
N, B Braun Excel, and Braun Ecobag.
Drug volume will be calculated based on subject weight: For exa mple, a subject receiving 
10 mg/kg elotuzumab who weighs  80 kg on Day 1 [predose] w ill req uire 800 mg of study drug 
for infusion. Withdraw 32 mL of elotuzumab (25 mg/mL) from [ADDRESS_390825] receiving 20 mg/kg elotuzumab [predo se] will require 1600 mg of 
study drug for i nfusion. Wit hdraw 64 mL of elotuzu mab (25 mg/mL) from [ADDRESS_390826]. Used 
elotuzumab vials will be stored until study drug accountability has been completed by [CONTACT_317436], and destruction or return is authorized. Used vials do not need to be refrigerated.
Note: Subjects must be premedicated as described in Section 4.5.[ADDRESS_390827] dose of elotuzumab will be administered following premedications (de scribed in 
Section 4.5.4) to each subject as a n IV infusion, using an automated i nfusion pump set at an 
initial r ate of 0.5 mL per minute (30 mL/hour). If the sub ject does not have an infusion reaction 
within [ADDRESS_390828] an infusion r eaction within 30 minutes, escalate the i nfusion r ate to a maximum of 2 mL
per minute (120 mL/hour). If a subject experiences a Grade ≥[ADDRESS_390829] be interrupted. Please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for detailed inform ation on the management 
of infusion reaction and re-initiation of infusion.
The second dose of elotuzumab must be initiated at an  infusion r ate of 3m L per minute if no 
infusion reactions were observed with the first elotuzumab infu sion. If the subject does not 
experience an infusio n reaction during the first [ADDRESS_390830] be initiated at an infusion r ate of 5m L

aAll response categories require 2 consecutive assessments made at any time before the institution of any new 
therapy; all categories also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies 
were perfor med. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these res ponse requirements. Bone marrow 
assessments need not be confirmed.
bNote clarific ation to IMWG criteria for coding CR and VGPR in patients in wh om the only measurable disease is 
by [CONTACT_317437] C levels: CR in such patients is defined as a normal FLC ratio of 0.26-1.65 in addition to CR criteria 
listed above . VGPR in such patients is defined as a > 90% decrease in the d ifference between involved and 
uninvolved FLC levels.
cPresence or absence of clonal cells is based upon the κ/λratio. An abnormal κ/λratio by [CONTACT_317438]/or immu nofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analy sis. An abnormal ratio reflecting 
presence of an abnormal clone is κ/λof > 4:1 or < 1:2.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pomalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines 
and Acceptable Birth Control Methods 
Risks Associated with Pregnancy
Pomalidomide was found to be teratogenic in a developmental stud y in rabbits.  Pomalidomide is 
an analogue of th alidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe life-
threatening human birth defects.  If Pomalidomide is taken during pregnancy, it may cause birth 
defects or death to an unborn baby.
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a se xually mature woman who: 1) has 
not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) ha s not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not ru le out childbearing potential) 
for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any t ime in the preceding 
24 consecutive months).CounsellingFor a female of childbearing po tential, pomalidomide is contrain dicated unless all of the 
following are met (ie, all females of childbearing potential must be counselled concerning the 
following risks and requirements prior to the start of pomalidomide study therapy): 
•She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn ch ild
•She understands the need for effective contraception, without i nterruption, 28 days before 
starting study treatment, th roughout the entire duration of stu dy treatment, dose interruption 
and 28 days after the end of study treatment
•She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive  measures
•She is informed and understands the potential consequences of p regnancy and the need to 
notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregna ncy
•She understands the need to commen ce the study treatment as soo n as study drug is 
dispensed following a negative pregnancy test
•She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testi ng based on the frequency 
outlined in this protocol ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
•She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated 
with the use of pomalidomide
The investigator must ensure that females of childbearing potent ial:
•Comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk minimization, incl uding confirmation that she 
has an adequate level of understanding
•Acknowledge the aforementioned requirements

For a female NOT of childbearing potential, pomalidomide is cont raindicated unless all of the 
following are met (ie, all females NOT of childbearing potentia l must be counselled concerning 
the following risks and requirements prior to the start of poma lidomide study therapy): 
•She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated 
with the use of pomalidomide
The effect of pomalidomide on spermatogenesis is not known and h as not been studied. 
Therefore, male patients taking pomalidomide must meet the follo wing conditions (ie, all males 
must be counselled concerning the following risks and requireme nts prior to the start of 
pomalidomide study therapy):
•Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant female 
or a female of childbearing potential
•Understand the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if engaged in 
sexual activity with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential.  
Contraception
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this proto col must agree to use two reliable 
forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete a bstinence from heterosexual 
contact [CONTACT_317439]:  1) for at least 28 days before 
starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; 3) do se interruptions; and 4) for at least 
[ADDRESS_390835] include one high ly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to  a qualified provider of 
contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contraception:  
•Highly effective methods:
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants)
Tubal ligation
Partner’s vasectomy
•Additional effective methods:
Male condom
Diaphragm
Cervical Cap

switch to another one of the effective methods listed above. Th e risk of venous 
thromboembolism continues for 4−6 weeks after discontinuing comb ined oral contraception. The 
efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co-tre atment with dexamethasone.
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk 
of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics 
should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia. 
Pregnancy testing
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity  of 25 mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including femal es of childbearing potential who 
commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.
Before starting study drug
Female Patients:FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) prior to 
starting study drug.  The first pregnancy test must be performe d within 10-[ADDRESS_390836] be perfor med within 24 hours prior to the 
start of study drug.  The pa tient may not receive study drug un til the study doctor has verified 
that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative.Male Patients:Must practice complete abstinence or  agree to use a condom dur ing sexual contact [CONTACT_4490] a 
pregnant female or a female of chil dbearing potential while parti cipating in the study, during

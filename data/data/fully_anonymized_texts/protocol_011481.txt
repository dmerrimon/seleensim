Title:  Wet Time for a Foam Hand Sanitizer with 70% ethyl alcohol  
 
Study Description:  Hand sanitizers are a standard of hygiene requirements. They must be 
effective at reducing germ count on the hands while ideally providing 
emollients to moisturize the skin aft er use. Spectrum ™ Advanced Hand 
Sanitizer Foam (70%)   (hereby [CONTACT_536365])  kills 
over 99.99% of germs within 15 seconds while boasting double digit 
increases in hand moisture after two weeks of use.  
 
In 2002 and 2009 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) and 
World Health Organization  (WHO) published guidance that hands should 
remain wet for at least [ADDRESS_698435] to be apply.  1, 2 
 
This study will evaluate  the “wet time ” of Spectrum Advanced Foam , which 
will be defined as the length of time in which the sanitizer foam stays wet  on 
the hands  while the participant rubs their hands with the foam sanitizer . The 
participant  will first be asked to wash an d dry their hands. Participants will 
review the appropriate hand sanitizer application steps, as detailed by  [CONTACT_536366]. Then , a 1.0 mL  or 1.4 mL* aliquot of Spectrum Advanced 
Foam will be dispensed from an automated dispenser3 to the participant ’s 
hands . [ADDRESS_698436] 
has dried sufficiently for the donning of medical gloves . Study personnel will 
measure the wet time  of Spectrum Advanced foam  using a stopwatch.  
 
  
Phase:  
 Post-market.  
 
* The study is to include an interim analysis of the data after [ADDRESS_698437] completed the study on the medium 
dispenser setting  (1.0 mL). If the results demonstrate a satisfactory [ADDRESS_698438]. If at this point, the results demonstrate that the amount of 
hand sanitizer dispensed under the  medium setting (1.0 mL) does not sufficiently stay wet for at least [ADDRESS_698439] with another 46 participants who will undergo the study using the high dispenser 
setting (1.4 mL).

Description of Study 
Design:  Informed consent will be obtained from participants in -person or remotely. 
Participants will then undergo in-person or remote screening, after which 
participants who meet inclusion criteria will be enrolled in this prospective 
study. The participant will first be asked to wash and dry their hands, and 
wait an additional two minutes after drying their hands. Participants will 
review the steps for applying hand sanitizer, adapted from the WHO 
guidance. 4  The participant will then be asked to apply a n aliquot of 
Spectrum Advanced Foam, dispensed from an automatic dispenser (X10 
Dispenser, Medline Industries, LP), to their hands. The participant will be 
instructed to rub their hands together with  the sanitizer until their hands are 
dry. Study staff will measure and record the wet time of Spectrum 
Advanced Foam.  
 
 
  
Participant Duration:  Approximately [ADDRESS_698443] with another 46 participants who will undergo the study using the high dispenser 
setting (1.4 mL).  
2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Background & Rationale  
 
Hand sanitizers are a standard of hygiene requirements. They must be effective at reducing germ count 
on the hands while ideally providing emollients to moisturize the skin after use. In [ADDRESS_698444] has dried.1 
 
The goal of this study is to evaluate the  “wet time ” of Spectrum Advanced Foam , which will be defined  
in this study  as the length of time in which the foam sanitizer  stays wet  on the hands  while the participant 
rubs their hands with the foam sanitizer . 
2.2. Study Products  
2.2.1.   Medline Spectrum ™ Advanced Hand Sanitizer Foam (70%)   
Spectrum Advanced Hand Sanitizer Foam  kills over 99.99% of germs within 15 seconds . 
The formula includes  added moisturizers  to help reduce dry skin.  The SKU number for 
Medline Spectrum Advanced Hand Sanitizer Foam  is HH70F1000H .  
 
2.3. Risk/Benefit Profile  
2.3.1.  Potential Study Risks  
This study entails minimal risk to t he participants. Spectrum Advanced Foam is  
commercially available and widely used in clinical settings. There is the possibility of 
minor skin irritation with the application of Spectrum Advanced Foam , however the 
magnitude of this should be no greater than what occurs through the normal use of th e hand 
sanitizers . In addition, the study is designed such that the test product will be applied on 
the non -compromised skin of participants with no self-reported  known skin conditions, 
which should impose less risk for study participants.  
2.3.2.  Potential Study Benefits  
Direct benefit to the study participants is unlikely. However, the results from this study 
will provide the wet time for Spectrum Advanced Foam , which may better inform  product 
efficacy and  infection prevention for individuals applying Spectrum Advanced Foam  to the 
hands.

 Informed consent will be  obtained either in-person or remotely. Following  in-person or remote 
remote  participant screening, the participant will be asked to wash and dry their hands and wait an 
additional two minutes. The participants will review th e steps for hand sanitizer application, adapted 
from a WHO poster on application of handrubs. The participants will be i nstructed to apply a 1.0 mL 
or 1.4 mL * aliquot of Spectrum Advanced Foam to their hands. The Spectrum Advanced foam will 
be dispensed from an automated dispenser. The participant will then be asked to rub their hands 
together with the foam sanitizer until their hands are dry, following the WHO recommended method 
for hand sanitizer application. Study staff will use a stopwatch to measure the wet time: the 
application of the product to the palm of the participant will indicate the “start time”, and the 
partic ipant stating that their hands have dried will indicate the “stop time”.  
 
After the participant has indicated that their hands have dried  sufficiently for the donning of gloves , 
study staff will record the wet time of Spectrum Advanced Foam. The participa nt will then be 
dismissed from the study.  
 
 
4.2. End of Study Definition  
A participant will have complete d their study  participation  when all study activities are completed 
at the end of Visit 1.  
This study will be considered complete upon issuance of a Clinical Study Report that has been 
approved by [CONTACT_488739].

The participants will then be instructed by [CONTACT_536369] a 1.0 mL or 1.4 mL * aliquot of  
Spectrum Advanced Foam to their hands , which will be provided from an automated dispenser , 
following the hand sanitizer application steps.  Study staff will begin to measure the wet time 
using a calibrated stopwatch: the application of the product to the palm of the participant will 
indica te the “start time”, and the participant stating that their hands have dried will indicate the 
“stop time”.  
 
Once the participant has indicated that their hands are dry  enough to don medical gloves , study 
staff  will stop the stopwatch and record the Spectrum Advanced Foam wet time in the CRF.  
 
6.1.3.   Participant Dismissal   
After the study staff has recorded the wet time of Spectrum Advanced Foam in the CRF, the 
participant will be dismissed from the stu dy.  
7. ADVERSE EVENTS (AEs)  
7.1. Definition of AE   
The FDA definition for an AE is: An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or 
procedur e that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure.  
However, a  narrower definition of AE will be used for this study. In this study, an AE is any untoward 
medical occurrence related to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_536352] d uring this study,  including  skin 
itching, erythema, edema, or any other skin irritation that occurs.  
7.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
The FDA definition of a SAE will be used in this study: An AE or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered "serious" if, in the view of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_536353]:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse event,  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] o r prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or

 __________ _____________  
* The study is to include an interim analysis of the data after [ADDRESS_698449] completed the study on the medium 
dispenser setting (1.0 mL). If the results demonstrate a satisfactory [ADDRESS_698450]. If at this point, the results demonstrate that the amount of 
hand sanitizer dispensed under the medium setting (1.0 mL) does not sufficiently stay wet for at least [ADDRESS_698451]  with another 46 participants who will undergo the study using the high dispenser 
setting (1.4 mL).  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_536354], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
All SAEs will be reported to Medline, regardless of poten tial relationship to the study product(s). SAEs  
will be reported to the reviewing IRB as necessary according to their reporting requirements.  
7.3. Severity of AE  
The severity of all AEs will be graded on a scale of one through five according to the Common 
Terminology Criteria for AE guideline, where each grade represents a unique clinical description based 
on this general guideline:  
• Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observation 
only; intervention not indicated.  
• Grad e 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limited age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.  
• Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_536355]; disabling; limiting 
activities of daily living involving self -care.  
• Grade 4:  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5:  Death related to AE  
7.4. Relatedness of AE and SAE  
 
• Unrelated:  This category applies to those AEs which, after careful consideration, are 
clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.)  
• Possible:  This category applies to those AEs for which, after careful medical 
consideration at th e time they are evaluated, a connection with the Investigational 
Product administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.  
• Probable:  This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are ev aluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to 
be related to the study product(s).  
• Definite:  This category applies to those AEs  which, after careful consideration, are 
clearly and incontrovertibly due to the study product(s).

 7.5. Expectedness  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_536356]. An AE 
will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
the risk information previously described for the study interventi on.  
7.6. AE Reporting  
The AEs will be recorded on the AE form (provided by [CONTACT_488729], LP) by [CONTACT_488741]. Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity. Changes in severity will necessitate a new CRF to 
document the new level of severity. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset 
and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
Non-serious AEs will be reported to the IRB per IRB reporting requirements.  
7.7. SAE Reporting  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_488722] (provided by [CONTACT_488729], LP) and  will be responsible for 
reporting the event to the IRB, if applicable, per the IRB’s reporting requirements. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_536357], if applicable, within [ADDRESS_698452] your Medline clinical designee or

8.       INTERIM ANALYSES  
The study is to include an interim analysis of the data after [ADDRESS_698453] completed the study on 
the medium dispenser setting (1.0 mL). If at this point, the results demonstrate that the amount of hand 
sanitizer dispensed under the medium setting (1.0 mL) does not sufficiently stay wet for at an average of 
at least 15 seconds, a second data collection whereby [CONTACT_20904] 46 participants will undergo the study using 
the high dispenser setting (1.4 mL) will take place. If the results demonstrate a satisf actory average 15 
second wet time using the medium setting (1.0 mL) with 46 participants, the study results will be 
analyzed and it will be decided if an additional study using the 1.4 ml setting is warranted.

 9.      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1.   Sample Size Determination  
The sample size of 46 was estimated for 95% confidence interval based on a standard deviation of 5 seconds 
and target distance from mean to limits of 1.5 seconds (PASS -Confidence Intervals for One Mean). Results 
from a previous  study conducted by [CONTACT_536367] (summarized in the Appendix) was utilized as a starting point 
sample size estimation for the current protocol, using PASS 2021 Power Analysis and Sample Size 
Software (2021). NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003], ncss.com/software/pas s. In the event that a participant 
withdraws from the study, additional participants will be enrolled to achieve a final number of 46 
participants with complete data and until adequate power for analysis has been reached.  
                                                                    
9.2.   Randomization  
No randomization is planned at this time.  
9.3.   Populations for Analyses  
The analyses will be performed on the intent to treat (ITT) population which consists of all subjects who 
participated in the study, meaning they have full data on all covariates as well as the hand sanitizer dry 
time.  
No per protocol, safety, or other an alyses groups are planned.  
9.[ADDRESS_698454] of protocol deviations will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_536358].  All deviations will be reviewed 
and decisions for handling each of the deviations will be made prior to the start of data analysis.  
9.5. Endpoints  
 9.5.1. Primary Endpoint   
The time during which 1.0 mL of Spectrum Advanced Hand Sanitizer Gel with Aloe Vera and Vitamin E 
remains wet under conventional use conditions.  
  
9.5.2. Secondary Endpoint   
None . 
9.6. Demographics, Variables and Covariates  
 Age will be collected as a continuous measure, with all participants being >=18 years of age.  Age strata 
will be defined as stratum 1: 18 -25 years old, stratum 2: 26 -41 years old, stratum 3: 42 -57 years old, 
stratum 4: 58 -67 year s old, stratum 5: 68 -76 years old, stratum 6: 77 -94 years old, 95+ years old.  Age 
will be considered for secondary analysis.

Sex will be collected as a categorical equal to 0=male, 1=female, or 2=other.  Sex will be considered for 
secondary analysis.  
  
Hand size will be calculated using the formula 2.48 x hand length x hand breadth as described by 
(Wilkinson et al. (2017), Bellissimo -Rodrigues et al. (2015) and Hsu and Yu (2010)).    
  
 
9.7. Handling of Missing Values  
All missing data will be quantified in the final report and possible biases for any missing data will be 
reported.  
 
9.8. Statistical Analysis  
Statistical analyses will be conducted in SAS® software, Version 9.4 or higher of the SAS System for 
Windows (Copyrigh t © 2013 SAS Institute Inc.) or other appropriate statistical software. P<0.05 will be 
considered statistically significant.  
All continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: (non -missing 
sample size), mean, standard d eviation, median, maximum and minimum.  The frequency and percentages 
(based on the non -missing sample size) of observed levels will be reported for all categorical measures.  
95% confidence intervals will be calculated for all means.   
A box -and-whisker p lot will be employed to display the mean, interquartile range, range, and any possible 
outliers for wet -to-dry time.    
 Spearman correlation analysis will be used to examine possible associations between the key variable of 
dry time with age, sex, and han d size. Additional t -tests or non -parametric tests will be employed to 
further examine any significant associations found in the correlational analyses between key and covariate 
measures.   
If the results of the interim analysis of 46 participants on the m edium dispenser setting (1.0 mL) does not 
demonstrate that hands stay sufficiently stay wet for at an average of at least 15 seconds, a second data 
collection whereby [CONTACT_20904] 46 participants will undergo the study using the high dispenser setting (1.4 
mL) will take place.  All analyses presented above would then be repeated for the data from an additional 
46 participants at the high dispenser setting (1.4 m L).

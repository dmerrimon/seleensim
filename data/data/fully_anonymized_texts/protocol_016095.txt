1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title:  Musical E ngagement of brain LObes in Alzheimer’s D isease patients stud Y (MELODY)  
Study 
Description:  This is a controlled, single- blind, cross -over study design with 10 subjects  suffering from moderate 
to severe Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  without neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia designed to 
evaluate global clinical impact and  level of  arousal (physiological state of being alert, awake,  and 
attentive ) when subjects are exposed to emotionally impactful music compared to control 
intervention.

2.2 BACKGROUND 
There are a n estimated 6.2 million Americans aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer's dementia today2. 
Approximately one-third of these individuals fall into the moderate to severe range of the illness. Currently, 
physicians are unable to offer these patients any means to alleviate their symptoms other than the two classes of approved medications which pr ovide limited symptomatic relief  and a newly approved disease modifying 
treatment that, although approved, has yet to find its way into clinical practice. Recently, a number of reports show evidence that  music may provide an effective intervention for these individuals
3. However, most patients 
do not receive this treatment because there is not robust research to support music as an intervention. If music stimulation proves to be an effective biologically based intervention, we expect the scientific community and third -party payers to re -evaluate the role of music as a treatment for these patients.  
 A number of important factors provide the scientific basis for this proposal.  
1. Several experiments using brain imaging techniques have shown that music is a strong stimulator of brain 
activity. The initial activation is in the areas of the brain that we know process music and sound and allow us to appropriately perceive sounds and tunes (auditory association area). Specifically, this takes place in 
the superior temporal gyrus of the temporal lobe. It is important to note that brain activation generated 
by [CONTACT_453222]. For example, the music that an individual heard at their wedding will generate stronger brain 
activity than a tune for which they have no emotional connection.  
 
2. Brain stimulation from music can also expand to other networks of the brain through the process of entrainment. Entrainment is a principle of physics that allows for synchronization of activity of entities in close proximity. This principle has recently been shown to also apply to biological entities such as the 
brain. fMRI is an ideal approach to understand synchron ization among functional brain networks. This 
approach can also be applied to studies that use continuous stimulation paradigms such as listeni ng to 
musical pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]. It is important to note that if effective, this process should generate brain activation in minutes rather than days or weeks.  
 
3. The areas of the brain that are initially activated by [CONTACT_453223], including AD. This 
Page 10 of 30 phenomenon offers a unique opportunity to use these "unaffected brain areas" as an initial point for brain 
activation.  
 
4. Further supporting the concept of expansion of music activation in the brain (perhaps through the process of entrainment) are preliminary studies supporting music as a strong stimulator of brain activity in 
cognitively impaired subjects . A number of anecdotal reports and uncontrolled trials have provided 
optimism for the use of music to stimulate brain activity in patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders
4. 
 
Based upon both literature review and experiential interventions with music and subjects  with degenerative brain 
illness, this research team has identified the following hypotheses:  
Using a crossover design, stimulation with preferred music will lead to improvement in global clinical measures as 
assessed by [CONTACT_453224] a  higher level of  arousal  compared to stimulation with nature sounds in the same subjects. 
Stimulation with preferred music as opposed to nature sounds in the same subjects will demonstrate greater 
connectivity with brain networks associated with arousal  as demonstrated  by [CONTACT_40394].  
 Below we summarize the scientific background in more detail.  
 
1. Music is a strong stimulator of brain activity.  
 
Our understanding of music as a strong stimulator of brain activity emerges with the availability of neuroimaging 
techniques. The primary auditory cortex (transverse temporal gyri) lies in the superior temporal gyrus of the temporal lobe and extends into t he lateral sulcus and surrounding temporal cortex
5. Therefore, we expected this 
to be the main area stimulated by [CONTACT_89863]. Interestingly, studies have shown that other large areas of the brain are also stimulated by [CONTACT_89863]. Recent findings reveal that the amygdala (the center that regulates emotions), cingulate 
cortex (a major hub to integrate sensations), hypothalamus (area responsible for hormonal production), 
hippocampus (memory), insula (responsible for the physical manifestation of emotions like shaking when we are 
nervous), nucleus accumbens (related to sleep), and orbitofrontal cortex (center for integration of emotion and 
memory) are all potentially active when music is processed
6.This activation of nonauditory areas of the brain by 
[CONTACT_453225]. Specifically, positron emission tomography (PET), fMRI, and studies of brain lesions 
have shown that these areas of the brain stimulated by [CONTACT_453226]
7,8,9. These types of responses can trigger endocrine or hormonal changes, and the release of the 
associated neurochemicals can also affect emotion and cognition10. Therefore, we can hypothesiz e that music, 
while primarily affecting the auditory areas of the brain, has the ability to also affect other nonauditory areas, 
resulting in changes in emotion, cognition, and other physiological functions by s ame mechanism.  
 
2. Through the process of entrainment, the areas of the brain that are stimulated by [CONTACT_453227].  
 Entrainment is defined by a temporal locking process in which one system's motion or signal frequency entrains (synchronizes with) the frequency of another system. This process is a universal phenomenon that can be 
observed in physical (e.g., pendulum cloc ks) and biological systems (e.g., fireflies). Resent research however has 
shown that the same principle applies to the brain, allowing sensory areas to stimulate other areas of the brain 
Page 11 of 30 such as motor, emotional, and cognitive networks. It is therefore possible to conceive that stimulation of the 
auditory areas by [CONTACT_453228] a given brain network. In 
other words, the auditory cortex can serve as a conduit for engaging brain networks involved in arousal . For  that 
to occur, the primary areas being stimulated by [CONTACT_453229]11. 
  
3. The key areas of the brain activated by [CONTACT_453230].  
 Dementia of AD is a disorder characterized by [CONTACT_453231]’s  inability to function independently at his or her normal level
12. These symptoms are thought to be a 
reflection of the loss of neurons in brain areas responsible for multiple brain functions such as memory, executive 
function, visual spatial function, language, praxis (our ability to perform complex tasks), and others13. The level of 
lesions in specific brain areas have been strongly associated with changes in specific functions and disease severity
14,15. A recent study by [CONTACT_453232] 's lesions and those suffering from AD16. A study of 142 young controls, 87 older adults, 
28 subjects  with AD, and 35 older adults with neuroimaging data indicating the absence of brain amyloid  (the 
lesion that characterizes AD) evaluated the areas of the brain that are especially impaired in aging, AD, or both. 
They found that the specific areas related to auditory perception, and therefore the initial areas where music is 
perceived, are relatively unaffected in subject s with AD.  
 
4. Further supporting the concept of expansion of music activation in the brain (perhaps through the process of entrainment) are preliminary studies supporting music as a strong stimulator of brain activity in cognitively impaired subjects . 
 There are numerous anecdotal reports of individuals singing entire songs and performing on musical instruments, even when in late stages of AD. Current research sheds light on this fascinating and pervasive phenomenon of 
preserved musical memory, thanks to  sophisticated 7  Tesla fMRI data
17. Areas of the brain identified with memory 
for music include the caudal anterior cingulate cortex and ventral pre-supplementary motor area. Remarkably, as 
we discussed before, some of those areas are relatively spared fr om the degeneration common in AD, and show 
little disruption of glucose metabolism in PET scans17. However, brain network connectivity is often compromised 
in AD; therefore, it is important to find alternative routes for engaging  brain networks  associated with  arousal  in 
AD. 
 
In a meta -analysis of the research on effects of music interventions on healthy older adults who show some 
cognitive dysfunction, 10 studies reported an aggregate mean improvement of 0.03 (Effect sizes, -0.18 to 0.24, showing decreases as well as increases) on tests of cognitive functioning, while also finding improvement in 
depression, anxiety, disruptive behavior, and quality of life. These results support the use of a variety of music 
interventions as a safe, non -invasive, and nonpharmacological  approach
18. 
Studies  of the effects of music on the brain date back to the early 1990s with reports that college students 
improved their performance on standard tests when they listened to music for [ADDRESS_577970] of music on subjects’ level of  arousal, we hypothesiz e that our experiments 
will show a clear and evident increase in level of  arousal in  subjects after the proposed musical intervention19-21. 
For the purpose of this trial, arousal is defined as a  physiological state of being alert, awake, attentive.  
 
The goal of the proposed study is to perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], single- blind, randomized, crossover, controlled clinical trial 
to evaluate the efficacy  of music stimulation  on measures of global clinical improvement and increasing level of  
arousal . Furthermore, we expect to validate the clinical findings through the evaluation of changes in brain 
networks using the very same stimulation. 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
2.3.[ADDRESS_577971] ’s physical activity 
potentially causing injuries or falls if adequate supervision  is not provided.  
Risks associated with auditory stimulation  
The auditory system may be affected if the experimental music intervention o r the control consisting of nature 
sounds is provided at excess volume.  Risks associated with fMRIs 
fMRIs are made without using any ionizing radiation, so subjects  are not exposed to the harmful effects of ionizing 
radiation. But while there are no known health hazards from temporary exposure to the fMR I environment, the 
fMR I environment involves a strong, static magnetic field, a magnetic field that changes with time (pulsed gradient 
field), and radiofrequency energy, each of which carry specific safety concerns: The strong, static magnetic field will attract magnetic objects (from small items such as keys and cell phones, to 
large, heavy items such as oxygen tanks and floor buffers) and may cause damage to the scanner or injury to the subjects or medical professionals if those objects become projectiles. Careful screening of people and objects 
entering the fMR I environment is critical to ensure nothing enters the magnet area that may become a projectile.  
The magnetic fields that change with time create loud knocking noises which may harm hearing if adequate ear 
protection is not used. They may also cause peripheral muscle or nerve stimulation that may feel like a twitching 
sensation. The radiofrequency energy used during the fMRI scan could lead to heating of the body.  
Some subjects  find the inside of the fMRI scanner to be uncomfortably small and may experience claustrophobia
22. 
PSYCHOLOGICAL 
Risks associated with assessments and questionnaires 
Memory and cognitive testing may cause some individuals to become upset, frustrated, or tired. All participants 
have the right to decline to answer any questions and may ask to stop testing at any time for any reason.  
PRIVACY  
Risks associated with loss of confidentiality

to be beneficial to the subject . Subjects may also find the experience of listening to music and/or nature sounds 
enjoyable. 
Long term benefits  
If the study proves to be beneficial, it may result in a new treatment tool to enhance clinical well-being and level 
of arousal  in this population.  
2.3.[ADDRESS_577973]’s 
participation in the trial. Specifically,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_453193]:  
• At each study visit, inquire of subjects and family members as to whether any significant psychological concerns have arisen concerning the subject’s cognitive condition and progression in their disease (when 
applicable)  
• Encourage subjects and family members to call study staff if significant psychological issues should arise 
in the future concerning the subject’s cognitive condition and progression in their disease.  
Should study staff determine that a subject has experienced significant psychological issues in relation to  their 
cognitive condition or progression, the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_453194] s staff will treat this as an AE and ensure that the subject is 
adequately protected.

  The SIB -[ADDRESS_577976] and final interventional segment 
will be followed by [CONTACT_453236], SSS, and SIB-8 . Finally, at Visit 3, subjects will complete three 
consecutive 10-minute fMRI scans: resting state  (baseline measure) , preferred music, and  nature sounds , to be 
administered in a randomized order.  The resting state fMRI will serve as the baseline reading.  All measures will 
be done between 9am and 1pm.  
4.[ADDRESS_577977] that this population was the focus of the preliminary reports cited previously1,3,4. The 
diagnosis of AD will be established using the  National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and 
Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association ( NINCDS-ADRDA)  Alzheimer's Criteria  for 
possible and probable AD23 and the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of  Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -V) 
per clinical assessment by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_453195] . 
All research examined clearly states that brain activation via music depends on the type of music that is chosen1. 
This research established that the most effective type of music will be highly individual (AARP GCBH Meeting 
personal communication). The music to be selected will be different for each subject  and will have a special, 
emotional connection (positive) to the individual participating in the study . Therefore, during the Baseline Visit , 
the patient’s caregiver, as well as the subject, will be interviewed to establish the subject’s three favorite tunes. One of the identified tunes will be randomly selected to use as the experimental intervention. Each [ADDRESS_577978] the effects will 
subside entirely. We therefore designed this study to provide music stimulation in 10 -minute increments spread 
across 3 hours to observe if the intermittent stimulation either ov erlaps (and creates a “ dose” increase) or 
prevents a decline in the effect.

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_577983] and  level of  arousal  in subjects 
suffering from moderate to severe AD when exposed to emotionally impactful music compared to control 
intervention. In partnership with the study partner (a person who spends [ADDRESS_577984]’s condition), three tunes will be chosen for the purposes of the study. The 
tunes chosen will need to be related to a past meaningful, positive experience of the subject, as determined by 
[CONTACT_453220]’s study partner. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928] w ill be restricted in duration to between 1.5 and 2 minutes 
each. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_453196] a portable device, and subjects will be asked to listen 
to the melody using high quality (Bose), over -ear headphones. The total exposure time will be 10 minutes each 
hour over a three-hour period. The melody will be repeated as many times as necessary to complete the 10 -
minute period. The control intervention will involve listening to nature sounds at the same duration and 
administration scheme. fMRI will be used to identify how brain networks are modulated via exposure to this music and how they associate with the clinical findings.
 
6.1.2 DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
Over the course of 3 -hour sessions at Visit 1 and Visit 2, either the musical intervention o r the control intervention 
consisting of nature sounds will be delivered as 10 -minute segments at the top of each hour .  
6.2 TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
The researcher responsible for randomization will  design, implement, and maint ain randomization procedures. A 
software system will generate study assignment. When a treatment assignment is generated, a sound 
identification number will not be chosen in sequence from the treatment file but rather from the next sequential 
assignment in the  master randomization scheme. Thus, treatment assignment is unpredictable to clinical center 
staff . 
This is a single-blind, randomized, cross -over study with raters being blinded to the specific intervention (music or 
nature sounds) that the subjects receive. The study team will be instructed on the importance of maintaining the 
blind and special measures will be put in place to avoid inadvertent unblinding. R aters will be unaware if the 
subjects receive either music or nature sounds. Music will be provided through over-ear headphones  to prevent 
the raters from hearing the intervention being administered  and the evaluation will be performed after the 
intervention is complete . 
6.[ADDRESS_577985] this compliance at the end of each session in the Case Report Form (CRF). In the event that the subject is unable to complete the [ADDRESS_577986] will be added.

Discontinuation from the s tudy intervention does not mean discontinuation from the study, and remaining study 
procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  If a clinically significant finding is identified 
(including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will 
determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant f inding will be reported 
as an AE.  
 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the administration of all end of study outcome measures , if possible. 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
 An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• If any clinical AE  or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the 
study would not be in the best interest of the participant  
• Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study intervention (development of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia ) 
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that 
precludes further study participation  
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on CRF s. Subjects who 
sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be replaced.  
Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study, will not be replaced.  
7.[ADDRESS_577987] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_453241]/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to 
regain contact [CONTACT_453242] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_9145]’s study file.  
• Should the participant and the study partner continue to be unreachable, the participant  will be 
considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up.

the NINCDS- ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for possible and probable AD  and the DSM -V Diagnosis of AD  or other 
type of dementia , the review of medical records , and cognitive assessment using the MMSE . 
Clinical Global Impression of Change  
CGIC scales have been used extensively as primary outcomes in phase [ADDRESS_577989] from an instrument's ability to assess any change. The ADCS -CGIC, the Alzheimer's Disease 
Cooperative St udy - Clinical Global Impression of Change is the most commonly used process for obtaining an 
assessment of clinically meaningful change in clinical trials. T he ADCS -CGIC is a systematic method for assessing 
clinically significant change in a clinical trial as viewed by [CONTACT_124531]. The 
ADCS -CGIC requires the assessor to consider a number of cognitive, functional, and behavi oral areas prior to 
providing an overall "global" assessment of clinical change. It was designed in response to an FDA request and on the basis of a survey of Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study clinicians. It is performed by [CONTACT_453243], using a worksheet that comprehensively lists relevant 
symptoms potentially useful in judging clinically meaningful change, and allows for notes for future reference- it takes approximately [ADDRESS_577990] Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_453197] 1972 and is a one -item self -report questionnaire measuring 
levels of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_453198]. The scale, which can be administered in 1 -2 minutes , is generally used to 
track level of  arousal  at each hour of the day. The scale has been validated for adult populations aged 18 and 
older. The SSS is used in both research and clinical settings to assess the level of intervention or effectiveness of a specific treatment in order  to compare a client's progres s.  
The Severe Impairment Battery  (8-item)  
The SIB evaluates cognitive abilities at the lower end of the range. There are [ADDRESS_577991] ions include:  
• 'What's your name?'  
• 'Please write your name [CONTACT_180376]'  
• 'What do you call the thing you drink coffee from?'  
The SIB is divided into scorable subscales, each sampling within the range expected of the severely -impaired 
individual. The six major subscales are attention, orientation, language, memory, visuospatial ability and construction. There are also brief evaluations of praxis and the patient's ability to respond appropriately when his/her name [CONTACT_453253] (orienting to name). In addition, there is an assessment of social interaction skills.  
The range of possible scores is [ADDRESS_577992] should only be used with patients 
known to be severely impaired. However, it is possible to grade the severity of impairment by [CONTACT_453244] 63 on the SIB  (corresponding to less than 4 on the MMSE) as 'very severely impaired'. A recently 
derived 8 -item version of the SIB — the SIB -8 — which takes about 3 min utes  to administer, may represent a more 
convenient tool for use in clinical practice. Very good inte rnal consistency/agreement and strong correlations 
between the SIB and the more rapid and convenient SIB -8 indicate that the SIB -8 may be a useful and efficient 
clinical proxy for the full SIB in evaluating treatment response in patients with advanced AD.

NINCDS -ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for possible and probable AD  research diagnosis  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_453199] -ADRDA Alzheimer's criteria to make a 
research diagnosis of the subject’s AD status as possible or probable AD.    
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -V) research diagnosis  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_453200] -V criteria to make a research diagnosis of the 
subject’s AD status.   
Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)  
• The MMSE will be performed with the subject and assesses orientation, immediate and delayed recall, 
concentration, language, and construction skills on a [ADDRESS_577993] eligibility.  
Auditor y Assessment 
• An audiologist will perform pure- tone audiometry, where the subject will be instructed to raise their 
hand (or point to the appropriate ear) when they hear a tone.  
Vital signs  
• Vital signs (i.e.  sitting pulse and sitting blood pressure ) will be obtained by [CONTACT_7355]. 
Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test  
• The TUG Test measures the time (in seconds) taken for an individual to stand up from a standard armchair, walk 10 feet, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down. It  is a commonly used scale for measuring 
functional mobility and risk of falls.  
MRI Metal Screening Questionnaire  
• The MRI Metal Screening Questionnaire will be performed to determine if the subject has any metal items in their body that may be harmful in the scanner or may interfere with the MRI examination.  
Recording of AEs  and SAEs  
• See Section 8.4 for AE and SAE recording and classification.  
Assessment of intervention adherence 
• A compliance assessment will be recorded at Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 3. The duration of time that the subject adheres to the established procedures of the intervention will be logged during each visit on a  
CRF.  
Functional Network Analysis  
• MRI scanning includes collection of a high-resolution T1 -weighted MPRAGE (TR=2.3s, TE=2.23ms, flip 
angle=8°, 192 sagittal  slices, FOV=256x256mm), followed by a 10- minute resting state fMRI scan and two 
10-minute stimulation scans (nature sounds/preferred music; acquisition parameters: 3 mm
3 voxels, 
TR=1.1s, TE=30 ms, flip angle=65°, 51 axial slices, matrix=64x64, 375 time points, acceleration factor =3). 
Gradient field maps will also be collected. More information about fMRI resources will be provided upon request.  
8.[ADDRESS_577994] medical occurrences associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not 
considered intervention-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  AEs the PI [INVESTIGATOR_453201], related to the 
Page 23 of 30 study intervention, and/or medically important for an individual participant, regardless of causality, will be tracked 
during this study.  
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of the PI , it results in any of the following 
outcomes: death, a life -threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or a 
persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention.  
8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe 
severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures  and 
cause some interference with daily activities . 
• Severe – Events incapacitate a participant in daily activities and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION 
All AEs must have their relationship to the study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_453202]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality 
will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study intervention must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and 
event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study intervention 
caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or 
an alternate etiology has been established.   
EXPECTEDNESS  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_453203].  An AE will be considered 
unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention.   
8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews 
of a study participant.  
 
All AEs not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate CRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, PI ’s assessment of severity, relationship to study intervention (assessed 
only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the 
Page [ADDRESS_577995] be documented appropriately regardless of 
relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each 
level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration 
of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
The study coordinator  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent 
is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At each 
study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_577996] and their study partner, the subjects’ primary care 
physician  will be informed of all AEs and SAEs as per GCP guidelines.   
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Initially, baseline variables and o utcomes (Clinical Global Impression of Change, Stanford Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110]) will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics for each intervention. For the primary comparison of outcomes between 
visits 1 and 2, general linear mixed models will be constructed.  GLMMs are an excellent means of accounting for 
clustering (correlation) of observations within subjects over time , which naturally occur as a part of crossover 
designs such as this. The models for CGIC, SSS and SIB -8 wi ll include main effects for sequence (intervention order), 
period (a subject's first  or second trial), and intervention (music vs. nature sounds) , along with random subject 
effects . Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] n=10 , the focus will be on estimating group differences as opposed to formal 
hypothesis testing.  The estimates provided by [CONTACT_453245] a future more definitive crossover trial.   
For fMRI analysis  based on data from Visit 3 , we will use analytic methods similar to those used in our prior 
publications of functional network connectivity
25-29 and similar to other studies30. Briefly, following fMRI 
preprocessing and nuisance signal regression, residual time series from each of 294 brain regions (nodes) will be submitted to partial correlation to establish the connectivity between each pair of nodes in the network, controlling for connectivity of all other nodes. These pair -wise correlations then serve as edge weights in the 
calculation of graph -theory measures like diversity coefficient.  
The Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT)
[ADDRESS_577997]. The higher the diversity coefficient of the auditory cortex, the greater the spread of infor mation to other networks in the brain [JL2] [a3]. 
Visualization of the connectivity of the auditory cortex as measures by [CONTACT_453246] -parietal networks associated with  arousal  in the preferred music 
condition compared to continuous resting state  or nature sound conditions.  A separate GLMM will then be used 
to determine whether the diversity coefficient differs by [CONTACT_52886]; this model will include main effects for 
Page 25 of 30 sequence (intervention order) and intervention (because there is only one MRI session, period is not applicable) , 
along with random subject effects . 
 
[ADDRESS_577998] meets these basic criteria, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_453204] (ICF) to both the subject 
(and if applicable the subject’s legal authorized representative) and the caregiver/informant to participate in the study. After the Informed Consent is fully discussed, and all questions are answered, another designated 
investigator determines whether the subject has the capacity to provide their own informed consent. For those 
subjects with Decision Capacity, the subject will then sign their o wn ICF. For those subjects without Decision 
Capacity, the subject’s legal authorized representative by [CONTACT_453247], with verbal assent from the subject.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_453205], which will be fully discussed with the subject. All questions will be answered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_453206]. The 
subject and the subject’s legal auth orized representative (if applicable) will sign the HIPAA Authorization form 
thereafter. A copy of the signed ICF, the signed HIPAA Authorization form, and the Notice of Privacy Practices 
will be given to the subject.  
Decision Capacity  
Decision capacity is determined every time an informed consent is executed, regardless of subject’s clinical 
presentation. Subjects are evaluated by a clinician (MD or  master level clinician) independent of the study team 
to determine if they have decision capacity. If the subject does not have decision capacity, a legally authorized 
representative (spouse, all next of kin, or individual with healthcare power of attorney) will be required to review and sign the Informed Consent.  
The decision capacity determination will be completed on a separate form which states the study subject's 
ability to make a decision regarding participation in the study and then dated and signed by [CONTACT_453248].   
Decision capacity process will be repeated for any new informed consents using the same procedures as above. Research subjects are free to withdraw informed consent at any time if they desire to do so. Appropriateness of 
a research subject’s involvement in a research study is evaluated on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_978]. 
It should be noted that the ability to provide informed consent is based on decision capacity at the time of administration of the informed consent, not on the severity of the disease. If the subject has agreed to participate in the study and the study procedures, the subject will not need to be reassessed for decision capacity given the short duration of the study.

Safety Monitor will review study data and procedures if early termination of the study, amendment to the protocol, or changes to the data collection plan are needed.  Should the protocol or data collection plans be amended as a result of data review, the IRB will be 
notified and the amendment approved prior to study amendment implementation. In addition, the participants will be notified of any significant new findings that develop during the course of research (e.g., other potential 
risks) that may affect their wish to continue participation in the study.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_578003] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_453207] 27 of 30 Prior to completing any protocol procedures:  
1. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_453208] (CITI) course on 
protections of human subjects in research. The CITI was founded in March 2000 as collaboration between the 
University of Miami and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to develop a web- based training program 
in human research subjects’ protections.  
2. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_453209] d training for administering the MMSE,  TUG, MRI Metal Screening 
Questionnaire, CGIC, SSS, and SIB -8.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_453210].  
This is a single site study, and individual data will not be shared with any other research site. The data collected will not contain any identifiers. No identifying data is shared with any source outside the local research team 
without specific release of information from the subject.  
Data will be stored in a locked office within a locked suite only accessible to authorized personnel. The research 
data will be stored and managed in REDCap, a secure web-based database system designed for clinical research 
studies.  
Types of Raw Data  
Raw data will be results of CGIC, SSS and SIB-8, along with fMRI results. The study coordinator will develop and maintain common study documents including the protocol, manuals, template consent documents , and policy 
and procedures memoranda. These documents will ensure that study participants are enrolled, treated, and followed according to the same procedures. The study coordinator will also maintain an official study chronology 
of important events occurring during the trial, including protocol revisions and serve as the repository for study documents. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_453211]. Study personnel will be trained and certified in study procedures for treatment and data collection 
before the study begins and training will be reinforced as indicated.  
Standards to be used for raw and meta -data format and content  
Prior to initiation of participant recruitment, the Data Management Team will develop detailed methods for data collection.  Data will be recorded on CRFs. The study coordinator and psychometrician  will have primary 
responsibility for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], testing, and maintaining the CRFs in collaboration with the PI . Forms will be 
identified by a participant study ID number and an alpha code to prevent personal identifiers from being transmitted to the Data Management Team . Data will be entered into a data system a nd the Data Management 
Team will oversee data storage. Backup files of the database will be stored at regular intervals in a secure, off -site 
location, to permit regeneration of the database in the event that it is destroyed. CRFs will be available through 
the study website in real -time. A study investigator will maintain a clinical chart for each participant that will 
contain source documents including clinical information and progress notes.  
Plans for archiving the raw and meta- data, and for ensuring continuous access 
The research data will be stored and managed in REDCap, a secure web -based database system designed for 
clinical research studies.  The REDCap database will be developed by [CONTACT_3476], with oversight from the 
biostatistician ([CONTACT_453255]).  REDCap  will facilitate data archival, data analyses, and data sharing.   
STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
Study documents should be retained for 25 years.  
10.1.7 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol or the International Conference on 
Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP). The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, 
the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
Page 28 of 30 These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1

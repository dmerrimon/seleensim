 Protocol Summary  
Title: A Multiple -Site, Phase 1/2, Safety and Efficacy Trial of a Recombinant Adeno -
associated Virus Vector Expressing Retinoschisin (rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1) in 
Patients with X -linked Retinoschisis  
Phase : 1/2 
Population:  Approximately 27 males with X-linked retinosch isis 
Study 
Duration:  Enrollment in this study is anticipated to take approximately  [ADDRESS_933056] year after 
study agent administration.  To monitor for delayed adverse events  (AEs) and 
assess the duration of any visual changes that occur , participants will be 
followed annually for an additional  4 years  after the Month 12 visit . 
Study Site s: This will be a multi -center study  
Description 
of Study 
Agent:  rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1  is a replication -incompetent, recombinant adeno -
assoc iated virus (rAAV) vector  that expresses  the retinoschisin (RS1) protein  
after the vector enters retinal cells.  This type of vector has been shown to 
improve visual function  in animal models of X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS ). 
The rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1  vector consists of a single -stranded DNA contained 
within an AAV capsid.  The DNA contains the RS1 cDNA in an expression 
cassette, flanked by [CONTACT_688004].  The AAV capsid was selected based on its 
ability to enter retinal cells when deli vered by [CONTACT_63385].  The 
rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1  vector is produced using  a replication -defective herpes 
simplex virus helper system in baby [CONTACT_688005].  It is stored frozen and will be thawed and dilut ed to 
the appropriate concentration immediately before administration  by [CONTACT_688006].  
Objectives : Primary:  To evaluate the safety of rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1  in patients with 
X-linked retinoschisis  
Secondary:  To evaluate the efficacy  of rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1  in patients with 
X-linked retinoschisis  
Study 
Design : This will be a non-randomized, open label , Phase 1 /2 dose escalation study.  
Approximately 27  participants will receive rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1  by [CONTACT_688007] a single occasion as outlined in the schematic below .

 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
1.1 Background Information  
1.1.1  X-linked Retinoschisis  
X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), also known as X -linked juvenile retinoschisis,  is an early onset 
retinal degenerative disease and is the leading cause of juvenile macular degeneration in 
males.  Characteristic features include mild to severe loss in central vision, radial streaks arising 
from foveal schisis, splitting of inner retinal layers in the peripheral retina, and a negative 
electroretinogram (ERG ) arising from a marked reduction in b -wave amplitude [1, 2] .  Best 
corrected visual acuity is reduced to 20/[ADDRESS_933060] patients [3].  Disease p rogression 
and severity is highly variable even within families.  During the course of the disease, secondary 
complications including retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage can occur, leading to a 
poor outcome.  Female carriers are asymptomatic althoug h detailed clinical examination can 
reveal minor retinal abnormalities [4]. 
XLRS is caused by [CONTACT_688010] a protein ca lled retinoschisin (RS1), a 
cell-surface adhesion molecule expressed by [CONTACT_688011] [3].  
The 24 -kDa protein has two conserved sequence motifs; a n initial signal sequence targets the 
protein for secretion and the larger discoidin domain is implicated in cell adhesion.  RS1 helps to 
maintain the structural organization of the retinal cell layers and promotes visual signal 
transduction.  
There is no s pecific treatment for XLRS.  Anecdotal reports suggest that topi[INVESTIGATOR_687989] [5-9], but the absence of controlled 
clinical trials makes interpretation of these reports difficult.  No products have been approved by 
[CONTACT_688012].  
Mice deficient in retinoschis in have been developed and used to obtain insight into the role of 
retinoschisin in retinal structure, function and pathology.  Studies in these murine m odels of 
XLRS have shown that recombinant adeno -associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy vector s 
expressing  normal RS1 can provide significant restoration of retinal structure and function in 
RS1-deficient mice [10-16].  These studies support the medical plausibility that intraocular 
delivery of a rAAV vector expressing human RS1 in patients with XLRS will also provide benefit 
to these patients.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Adeno -associated V irus 
Adeno -associated virus (AAV) is a  parvovirus with a single -stranded DNA genome [17].  It was 
originally discovered as a laboratory contaminant of adenovirus cultures [18, 19]  and it requires 
a helper virus such as adenovirus or herpesvirus to complete its replication cycle in culture and 
in humans [20, 21] .  Although serologic tests indicate a high prevalence of prior infection, AAV 
has not been associated with human disease [22].   
The AAV virion is composed of a mixture of three structural proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) which 
encapsidate the linear, single -strand DNA molecule [17].  The genome contains approximately 
4700  nucleotides consisting of inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences of 145  nucleotides that 
flank the two viral genes, rep and cap.  The rep gene is transcribed from two promoters, each of 
which generates spliced and unspliced transcripts that are translated into  the four replication 
proteins .  The cap gene uses a separate  promoter to generate transcripts for the three structural 
proteins through a combination of alternate splicing and al ternate translation start codons.  The 
three structural proteins self -assemble to form an icosahedral capsid in which the AAV genomic 
DNA is contained.  
Replication of AAV DNA occurs via a single -strand displacement mechanism [23-25] that is 
dependent on the AAV Rep proteins, host proteins and additional proteins provided by a h elper 
virus.  In the absence of the helper virus, wild -type AAV can establish latency in cell culture by 
[CONTACT_688013] -specific integration with the assistance of Rep proteins through the interaction of the 
ITR with the chromosome [26].  AAV does not appear to integrate in humans, but instead exists 
as circular double -stranded epi[INVESTIGATOR_687990] [27]. 
1.1.2  Recombinant AAV Vectors  
Recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors have been developed by [CONTACT_688014], 
inserting a transgene expression cassette between the ITRs, and packaging the vector DNA 
into AAV capsids in a packaging cell .  rAAV vectors are uniquely suitable for in vivo  gene 
therapy because they are non -toxic, highly efficient at transducing a wide variety of non -dividing 
cell types, and persist for long periods, primarily in epi[INVESTIGATOR_687991], resulting in long -term 
expression of the transgene [28].  rAAV vectors have been effective for treatment of a wide 
variety of animal models of genetic diseases, including retinal diseases [11, 12, 29 -32], 
hemophilia [33, 34] , muscular dystrophy [35, 36] , lysosomal storage disorders [37-39] and 
diseases of the central nervous system [40-42].  
Several serotypes of AAV have been identified in humans and a larger number have been 
identified in nonhuman primates [43].  Hybrid AAV vectors can be prepared that cross -package 
rAAV DNA containing serotype 2 ITRs into the capsids of other AAV serotypes [44], and these 
hybrid vectors have different physical characteristics, including different affinities for the cell 
surface receptors to which they bind and different tissue tropi[INVESTIGATOR_687992] .

13 
 Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_687993].  Capsids with 
mutations in surface -exposed tyrosine residues to phenylalanine (YF mutants) have been 
documented to enhance the efficiency of transduction in mouse retina after intravitreal injection, 
and several of these rAAV mu tants were found to display strong and widespread transgene 
expression in many retinal cells after subretinal or intravitreal delivery compared with their wild -
type counterparts [45].  Subsequent studies i n mice  showed that  intravitreal injection  of 
rAAV -GFP vectors packaged in AAV2 capsids containing multiple YF mutations achieved  
uniform GFP expression through the entire thickness of the retina [46].   
For intravitreal injection , an important consideration is the different anatomy of the primate eye 
and the eye of lower animals.  Humans and nonhuman primates  are the only species that have 
cone photoreceptors, which  are responsible for fine visual acuity and color vision, concentrated 
in the central regions of the macula and especially the very central fovea.  They also have an 
inner limiting membrane (I LM) that is thicker than the IL M in mice or dogs, except in the region 
of the fovea where the ILM is much thinner.  Thus intravitreal injection of rAAV vectors of a 
variety of unmodified serotypes can cross the ILM in mice but have little or no ability to cross the 
ILM in nonhuman primates  except in the region around t he macula .  Studies in rhesus 
macaques described in section [IP_ADDRESS]  below showed that intravitreal injection of rAAV vectors 
packaged in AAV2 capsids containing three YF mutations (AAV2tYF) is able to achieve efficient  
transduction of retinal ganglion cells and foveal cone photoreceptors and secretion and spread  
of retinoschisin  throughout the inner retinal layers in the macula, which is a critical area where 
schisis occurs in patients with XLRS.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_933061] previously demonstrated their utility in the development of ge ne-based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [47, 48]  and through June [ADDRESS_933062] been eva luated in 117 clinical trials, of which 
52 were for monogenic diseases  [49].  Clinical trials for ocular diseases include Leber 
congeni tal amaurosis  [50-52] and choroideremia  [53], in which AAV vectors were administered 
by [CONTACT_688015] , and age -related macular degeneration , in which AAV vectors were 
administered by [CONTACT_688015] [54] or intravitreal injection  [55].  Available data from these 
studies have reported no serious adverse events (SAEs) attributed to the AAV vect or and 
evidence of improvement in one or more measures of visual function in the majority of patients . 
Results of initial human clinical experience with rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 are summarized in the 
Clinical Investigators Brochure.

 1.1.4  Nonclinical Studies with AAV -RS1 Vectors  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Studies  in RS1 -deficient Mice  
Studies in animal models of XLRS indicate that rAAV gene therapy vector s expressing normal 
mouse or human RS1 can correct the defects in RS1 deficient mice  [10-16].  The vectors used 
in these studies are  summarized in  Table 1.

CMV = cytomegalovirus, RS1 = retinoschisin, hRS1 = human RS1, mOP500 = 500 base 
pair mouse opsin, rho = rhodopsin, CAG = CMV enhancer / chicken beta actin 
(synonymous with CBA or CB)  
Each of these vectors was shown to restore the reduced ERG b -wave response  towards normal 
in vector -treated eyes compared to control eyes.  Several studies also demonstrated 
preservation  of photoreceptor structure, reduction in the number and size of schisis cavities, and 
impro vement in visually mediated behavior.  Rescue of the XLRS phenotype was demonstrated 
using mouse or human RS1 cDNA , a variety of promoters , and either subretinal or intravitreal 
delivery.  
One of these studies  [15] indicated  that AAV transduction efficiency of the retinal layers differs 
significantly between wild -type mice  and RS1 -deficient  mice.  As stated in a report of that study , 
“the absence of retinoschisin protein apparently causes a striking change in the properties o f the 
retina.  Wild -type murine retinas are not permeable to AAV vectors.  This lack of permeability is 
not dependent on AAV serotype … Vectors made from all serotypes tested so far are able to 
penetrate all retinal layers of Rs1 -KO mice and will even tran sduce the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_178712].  The lack of retinoschisin seems to significantly change the properties of the 
interstitial matrix making the retina permeable to particles that are at least 28 nm in diameter.  
Retinal permeability to AAV vectors is u niform across the Rs1 -KO retina and is not localized to 
regions showing schisis pathology.”    If a similar phenomenon occur s in patients with XLRS , 
intravitreal delivery of an AAV -RS1 vector is expected to penetrate more deeply into the outer 
retinal layer s of such patients than it would in individuals who do not have XLRS.  
Another  study compared AAV -RS1 vectors containing either a rhodopsin promoter that restricts 
transgene expression to rod photoreceptors or a CAG promoter  that achieves efficient 
AGTC -RS1-[ADDRESS_933063] responses 
with both promoters  [16]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vector Targeting  Studies  in Nonhuman Primates  
A study was conduct ed in rhesus macaques comparing rAAV vectors expressing GFP or RS1 , 
driven by a CB promoter  and packaged in each of three types of AAV capsids , for their ability to 
transduce the retina after intravitreal injection .  Because the amino acid sequence of human and 
rhesus are identical, the RS1 cDNA contained a 10 amino acid “myc” tag that is recognized by 
[CONTACT_2017] -myc monoclonal antibody.  All three capsid serotypes evaluated were able to penetrate 
the inner limiting membrane after intravitreal injection and achieve significant expression of GFP 
or RS1 myc in the retinal ganglion cell ring  and foveal cone photoreceptors .  The pattern of 
RS1 myc expressi on in the macula was essentially the same as that of endogenous RS1, except 
RS1 myc did not penetrate efficiently to the photoreceptor inner segments  in areas outside the 
fovea .  Less intense expression of GFP or RS1 myc was seen in the peripheral retina, bu t the 
pattern of RS1 myc in the periphery was consistent with the expected patter for a protein  
secreted into the extracellular matrix .  The most consistent results were obtained with an AAV2 
capsid containing tyrosine to phenylalanine (YF) mutations in thr ee surface -exposed tyrosine 
residues (AAV2tYF).  An example o f expression of GFP and RS1 myc after intravitreal injection 
with vectors packaged in the AAV2tYF  is shown in Figure 1.

A rhesus macaque received an intravitreal injection of rAAV2tYF -CB-GFP in one eye and rAAV2tYF -
RS1 myc in the other eye  at a dose of 1 × 1011 vg/eye .  An in -life fundus fluorescence photo  of an eye 
injected with the GFP vector  (left panel) showed expression of GFP (white) in the macula (donut -shaped 
area) and fovea (dot in the center of the macula) , retina l nerve fibers, and scattered foci in the peripheral 
retina .  Immunohistochemical examination of the same  eye (middle panel) showed expression of GFP  
(green) , which is an intracellular protein, in retinal ganglion cells across the macular region of the ret ina 
and in foveal cones.  Immunohistochemical examination of the other eye (right panel) showed 
expression of RS1 myc (red), demonstrating that the  protein was secreted into the extracellular matrix 
and spread through the inner layers of the retina.  
These r esults indicate that AAV vectors with a rAAV2tYF capsid and CB promoter are able to 
transduce appropriate retinal cells to enable delivery of RS1 protein to the region of the retina 
that is most affected in patients with XLRS.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Nonclinical Safety  and Biodistribution Studies  
Safety and biodistribution studies evaluating rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 have been conducted in 
RS1-deficient mice  and normal cynomolgus macaques.   
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Safety and biodistribution in RS1 -deficient mice  
In the mouse study, three groups of male mice (n = 20 per group) each received an intravitreal 
injection of 1 µL containing rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 at a concentration of 1  x 1012 vg/mL  (1 x 109 vg 
per eye) or 4  x 1012 vg/mL  (4 x 109 vg per eye) or [ADDRESS_933064] article -related gross 
necropsy observations.   
Microscopic pathology results demonstrated minimal to slight mononuclea r cell infiltrate and 
minimal to moderate RS1 labelling of the retina in both vector -treated groups .  At the Day 90 
sacrifice there was a decrease in the severity of splitting/disorganization of the inner nuclear 
layer of the retina in high-dose vector -treated animals .  Results of biodistribution testing 
detected vector DNA in the injected eye but in no other tissue . 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Safety and biodistribution in cynomolgus macaques  
In the nonhuman primate study, three groups of male macaques (n = 6 per group) each 
received  an intravitreal injection of 110 µL containing rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 at a concentration of 
3.6 x 1011 vg/mL  (4 x 1010 vg per eye) or 3.6  x 1012 vg/mL  (4 x 1011 vg per eye) or 110 µL of 
vehicle control.  Half the animals were sacrificed 14 days after vector administration and the 
remaining animals were sacrificed 90 days after vector administration.   
The intravitreal injection procedure was well tolerated in all groups.   Ocular exam s 
demonstrated varying levels of inflammation over time.   
In the vehicle control group, aqueous cells ranged from trace to 4+  at 1 week after injection and 
resolved by [CONTACT_10585] 2.  Vitreous cells ranged from trace to 2+ at 2 to 3 weeks after injection, 
resolv ed by [CONTACT_10585] 4 in four animals and in the other two animals were resolved or resolving  at 
Week 12.  None of the animals in this group had vitreous haze.

 Ocular inflammation was greater i n the vector -treated animals  and was more pronounced at the 
higher dose.   Aqueous cells ranged from 1+ to 4+ at Week 1 in all animals, resolved by [CONTACT_10585] 2, 
recurred at Week 2 to 4 in two animals in the low dose and three animals in the high dose 
group , and then resolved over the next several weeks .  Vitreous cells developed in 5 of 6 
animals in the low dose and all animals in the high dose group, and p ersisted at 2+ or greater 
for more than 4  weeks in two animals in the low dose and three animals in the high dose group.  
Vitreous haze developed at Week 4 in one animal in the low  dose and three animals in the high 
dose group and resolved over the next several weeks.  
The frequency, magnitude and time course of ocular inflammation at doses  of 4 × 1010 and 
4 × 1011 vg/eye in this study was similar to that seen in a toxicology study of an AAV2 vector 
expressing a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor delivered by [CONTACT_688016] a dose of 2.4 × 1010 vg/eye [56].  When that product was evaluated by [CONTACT_688017] a human clinical trial, ocular inflammation developed in 1 of 11 subjects who 
received the  2.4 × 1010 vg dose, which was treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_687994] 5 weeks during 
which time it resolved [57]. 
There was no appa rent effect of vehicle control or rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 at either dose level on 
intraocular pressure , and no changes in ERG or visual evoked potential responses.  
There were no intergroup differences in hematology, coagulation or clinical chemistry 
parameters  and no test article -related gross necropsy observations.   
Microscopic pathology results demonstrated RS1 labelling of the ganglion cell layer at the foveal 
slope and minimal or moderate mononuclear infiltrate at the optic disc and/or around blood 
vessels in  the ganglion cell layer, iris, and ciliary body of the injected  eye at both dose levels .  
RS1 labelling of the ganglion cell layer at the foveal slope was observed in all animals at the 
higher dose and in 5  of 6 animals at the lower dose .  Mononuclear inf iltrate s at the optic disc 
and/or around blood vessels in the ganglion cell layer, iris, and ciliary body of the injected  eye 
was observed in [ADDRESS_933065] ed vector DNA in the injected eye but minimal or no vector  DNA 
was found  in any other tissue . 
1.2 Rationale  
1.2.1  Rationale for Gene Therapy of XLRS  
XLRS is selected for experimental treatment by [CONTACT_688018]1 to achieve 
improvement in disease manifestations in RS1 -deficient mice, an acceptable safety profile in 
mice and nonhuman primates, and clinical experience indicating that AAV vector s expressing a 
variety of transgenes can be administered safely in human patients  with preliminary evidence of 
efficacy .

 The retinas of patients with XLRS are more fragile  than normal  and prone to disease 
complications, such as vitreous hemorrhage and re tinal detachment, which may lead to severe 
visual impairment [58].  Therefo re, a subretinal injection procedure in this patient population 
may pose a higher  risk to the visual function of the individual , and intravitreal delivery is 
preferred .  Studies in nonhuman primates demonstrated that intravitreal injection of rAAV2tYF -
CB-hRS1 achieve d expression of RS1 protein in the macula and fovea, indicating the potential 
to deliver RS1 protein to the region of the retina that is most affected in patients with XLRS.  
Studies in RS1 -deficient mice indicate that the absence of retinoschis in changes the 
permeability of the retina to AAV vectors  [15], sugges ting that a rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 vector may 
be even more effective at delivering normal RS1 protein to larger areas of the retina in patients 
with XLRS.  
1.2.2  Rationale for Dosage Level  
Administration of rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 myc at a dose of 1 × 1011 vg per eye by [CONTACT_688019]1 myc protein in the macula and 
fovea.  Administration of rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 at a dose of 4 × 1010 or 4 × 1011 vg per eye by 
[CONTACT_688020] 
4 weeks after administration and progressiv ely improved over the ensuing 2  months.  At 
sacrifice, m icroscopic pathology results demonstrated RS1 la belling of the ganglion cell layer at 
the foveal slope in 5 of 6 animals in the lower dose group and all animals in the higher dose 
group.  Microscopic ally evident inflammatory cells , usually minimal and occasional ly moderate  
in intensity , were seen in 2 o f 6 injected eyes in the lower dose group and 4 of 6 injected eyes in 
the higher dose group .  The volume of a human eye is approximately 5  mL and the volume of a 
nonhuman primate eye is approximately 2.5 mL.  Based on this information, it is concluded that  
dose levels between  1 × 1011 vg per eye and 6 × [ADDRESS_933066] and study procedure .  If the safety evaluations 
identify no dose -limiting toxicity in Group 1 A, subjects with l ess severe disease will be 
appropriate for enrollment at the next higher dose (Group 2) .  Subjects with less severe disease 
will also be enrolled in Group 1B, at the same dose level as Group [ADDRESS_933067]  dose  level (Group 3). If the safety evaluations identify no dose -limiting 
toxicity in Group 2A, it will be appropriate to enroll subjects in Group 4.  
AGTC -RS1-[ADDRESS_933068] improvements in v isual function occur  in 
younger animals [13].  This information provides the rationale that  pediatric patients with XLRS 
are likely to benefit from participation in this clinical trial.

study agent administration  medications, and risks relate d to other study procedures.  
Human clinical experience with intravitreal  administration of rAAV vectors is limited, so the risks 
associated with this clinical trial are not completely known.  Based on preclinical studies with 
rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1  in RS1 -defici ent mice and  nonhuman primates , it is anticipated  that 
intravitreal  administration of rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1  will not cause SAEs  in humans.  The safety of 
rAAV vectors in humans is also supported by [CONTACT_688021] , and extensive experience with 
rAAV vectors administered by [CONTACT_688022] (see Section 1.1.3 ).   
Risks associated with anesthesia are infrequent but  may include allergic reactions to local or 
general anesthetic drugs and a low risk of penetration of the eye or optic nerve during injection 
of local anesthetic drugs.  General anesthesia may also be ass ociated with nausea or systemic 
hypotension, and rarely with prolonged unconsciousness, drowsiness or disorientation, 
tachycardia or dysrhythmias, pneumonia or ,atelectasis, or death.  
Risks related to the study agent include inflammatory responses in the e ye, which can manifest 
as pain, redness or swelling.  The study agent and/or any resulting inflammation may lead to 
changes in the vitreous, posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) , traction  on the retina , retinal 
breaks ( holes  and tears ), and retinal detachments . Inflammation may involve any ocular tissue, 
including the vitreous, the  optic nerve, and the retina. Any of these events may require laser 
therapy (photocoagulation), cryotherapy, and/or surgical repair. Steroids  may be us ed as 
prophylactic tr eatment for inflammation  in this study  as described in the Study Manual  of 
Procedures .  Risks associated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], subconjunctival , intravitreal  or subtenon steroid use 
includes blurred vision , temporary burning or stinging , itching, eye pain. The most  common risks 
associated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] /local  steroids increased intraocular pressure , corneal infections,  and 
cataract  formation .   
Side effects associated with oral steroid are multisystemic and are related to both the average 
dose and duration of treatmen t. Major side effects include hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal axis 
AGTC -RS1-001 Version 8.0

20 
 suppression, psychiatric and sleep disturbances, weight gain and cushingoid appearance, 
heightened risk of common and opportunistic infections,  facial & body hair growth, 
numbness/tingling i n the legs and arms, shortness of breath, swelling of the limbs, flushed dry 
skin, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and  worsening of glycemic control in patients with existing 
diabetes, gastrointestinal side effects, including gastritis and peptic ulcer di sease, decreased 
bone density, osteoporosis, myopathy, elevated intraocular pressure/glaucoma, cataract 
formation, skin thinning and purpura  and isolated leukocytosis . These side effects are generally 
associated with long -term steroid use.  Prolonged systemic use of steroid in children may result 
in growth retardation.  
There is a potential for vector spread to the bloodstream.  In clinical trials with AAV vectors 
admin istered by [CONTACT_688015] , the frequency of this was low and lasted for less than a few 
weeks after vector administration.  Given the low doses to be administered and the low risk of 
vector spread to the bloodstream , vector spread to gonads is not co nsidered to be a reasonable 
possibility, and no precautions related to a participant’s partner becoming pregnant will be 
recommended.  
There is a potential risk that vector DNA sequences could integrate into a host chromosome and 
result in insertional mutag enesis, but studies in animals indicate this is very unlikely to occur.   
It is likely that subjects will develop antibodies to AAV, which might make it difficult or impossible 
for them to receive treatment with AAV vectors in the future . 
There is a potent ial risk that subjects will develop an immune response  to RS1 protein, and the 
clinical consequences if this were to occur are unknown.  
Risks associated with intravitreal injection of any product include the potential for pain, 
subconjunctival or vitreous hemorrhage, increased intraocular pressure, infection,  inflammation,  
retinal holes, retinal tears, retinal detachments or post -surgical cataract development that could 
require additional eye surgery.  Infection occurs uncommonly after intravitreal injectio ns and can 
usually be treated with antibiotics.  All of these complications could result in worsening of vision.  
There may also be an increase in intraocular pressure that would require treatment to lower the 
pressure.   
Risks associated with anterior cha mber tap (paracentesis), if preferred to be performed by [CONTACT_688023], include potential for pain, subconjunctival 
hemorrhage, infection, iris trauma, entry site leak, hypotony, hyphaema or endophthalmitis . 
Risks a ssociated with other study procedures include redness, discomfort or allergic reactions 
to topi[INVESTIGATOR_687995].  High blood pressure, 
cardiac dysrhythmias and closed angle glaucoma may be exacerbated by [CONTACT_688024], and light sensitivity may be experienced while the pupil is dilated.  Corneal 
AGTC -RS1-[ADDRESS_933070] lenses used in performing electroretinography testing.  
Risks associated with blood drawing include local pain /discomfort, bruising, infection or fainting.  
There may also be other risks that are currently unknown.  
1.3.2  Adequacy of Protection from Potential Risks  
The medical history and physical examination performed during the screening  and baseline  
visits will identi fy individuals with ophthalmologic or other medical conditions that would increase 
the risks associated with participation in the study.  Results of all laboratory and safety 
evaluations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_688025] , and the DSMC 
will review safety data from completed dosage level groups before enrollment into subsequent 
dosage level groups (see Section 7.4). 
Intravitreal injection of the study agent will be performed by [CONTACT_688026].  Participants will be followed 
up at frequent study visits with clinical evaluation and op hthalmic examination to prevent and/or 
mitigate the risks associated with steroid use.  
Participants will be provided with telephone numbers to contact [CONTACT_688027] -procedure complications or side effec ts from study 
agent administration, and will be promptly evaluated and treated if necessary to minimize the 
consequences of any complications.   
To minimize the likelihood of pain and bruising, phlebotomy will be performed by [CONTACT_61066].

 1.3.5  Risk/Benefit Analysis  
There is no currently approved  treatment for XLRS .  Preclinical s tudies indicate  that intravitreal 
injection of rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1  offers a reasonable hope  for improving vision in affected 
humans and have demonstrated an acceptable safety profile .  Clinical studies with other AAV 
vectors administered to patients with several types of retinal disease have demonstrated 
preliminary evidence of efficacy and no SAEs  related to the study agent. Thus the potential 
benefits are considered to outweigh the potential ri sks for participants in this clinical trial.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_933072] may involve children as subjects only if (a) the risk is justified by 
[CONTACT_32117]; (b) the relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at 
least as favorable to the  subjects as that presented by [CONTACT_167899]; and 
(c) adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children and permission of their 
parents or guardians.  Information relevant to these requirements includes the following : 
As stated above, preclinical studies indicate that intravitreal injection of rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 
offers a reasonable hope for improving vision in affected humans and have demonstrated an 
acceptable safety profile.  The clinical protocol design requires that  the study agent be tested in 
adult participants before enrolling any pediatric participants, thereby [CONTACT_688028].  Because t here is no approved therapy for XLRS, the available alternative approach 
is to monitor the patient and treat complications such as vitreous hemorrhage or retinal 
detachment if they occur.  As described in Section 6.1, the study provides for soliciting the 
assent of the children and permission of their parents or guardians to participate in the study .   
Based on this  information , protection of pediatric participants i s considered to be compliant with 
FDA regulations .

 4.3 Enrollment Procedures  
Male individuals with a diagnosis of XLRS , and a parent or guardian of children <18 years of 
age, will be invited to give info rmed consent prior to screening procedures.  After appropriate 
written informed consent /assent  has been obtained, potential participants will then undergo an 
assessment of their medical history, physical examination, and selected clinical laboratory tests

 5 STUDY AGENT  
5.1 Description  
rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 is a non -replicating, rep/cap -deleted, recombinant adeno -associated virus 
(rAAV) vector containing cDNA encoding the human retinoschisin (RS1 ) protein.   
The vector contains AAV serotype 2 inverted terminal repeats and an expression cassette 
consisting of  a CMV enhancer/chicken beta actin promoter, the human RS1 cDNA and an SV40 
polyadenylation sequence, and is packaged in an AAV2 capsid containing tyrosine to 
phenylalanine (YF) mutations in three surface -exposed tyrosine residues (AAV2tYF).   
The organiza tion of the elements in the DNA molecule is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 2 below.

ITR = inverted termi nal repeat, CB = CMV enhancer/ chicken beta actin 
promoter, RS1 = retinoschisin, pA =  polyadenylation signal  
rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1  was manufactured in compliance with  current Good Manufacturing 
Practices ( cGMP ) under contract to Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation (AGTC).  
5.[ADDRESS_933086] be stored at -65C or below .  
Stability testing indicates rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 is stable  for up to 3 years when stored at this 
temperature.  
5.3 Study Agent  Preparation and Dosage Levels  
Three  dose levels of rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1 , administered by [CONTACT_63385],  will be 
evaluated in this clinical protocol.  The low er dose level will be 1 × 1011 vector genomes (vg) per 
eye ( 0.07 mL  at 1.43 × 1012 vg/mL).  The middle dose level will be 3 × 1011 vg per eye ( 0.07 mL  
at 4.3 × 1012 vg/mL).  The high er dose level will be 6 × 1011 vg per eye ( 0.14 mL  at 4.3 × 1012 
vg/mL).      
Research pharmacy  personnel will thaw and dilute  and prepare  the study agent to the correct 
concentration  and volume according to  instructions provided in the study Pharmacy Manual.

then be used to cleanse the eyelids.  A sterile speculum will be inserted to separate the lids.   
Prior to injection the povidone -iodine solution will be reapplied to the injection site.  A cott on 
swab soaked in topi[INVESTIGATOR_687997].  Care should 
be taken not to express secretions from the meibomian glands in the lids.  
Sedation for the intraocular injection may be used at the discretion of the invest igator to insure 
that the intravitreal injection can be completed in a safe manner.  
The participant will be instructed to direct his  or her  gaze away from the site of needle entry.   
After the needle penetrates the sclera the needle is advanced toward the c enter of the glo be 
and the fluid is gently injected into the mid - to posterior vitreous cavity.  The needle is removed 
and a sterile cotton swab is immediately placed over the injection site to prevent reflux.  
For participants receiving the high dose in a volume of 0.14 mL , it is preferable to administer  a 
single injection  as it decreases the infection risk and it is more comfortable for the patient. 
However; the Investigator should confirm that there is perfusion of the retina after injection and 
be prepar ed to address unusually high or prolonged increase in IOP, if needed. Performing an 
anterior chamber  tap (paracentesis)  before this single injection is at Investigator’s discretion.  If 
the dose is alternatively administered as  two injections of 0.[ADDRESS_933088] methods at the discretion of the

 7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1  Primary Endpoint  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluat e the safety of rAAV2tYF -CB-hRS1  administered 
by [CONTACT_688034] .  The primary safety parameter will be the 
frequency of Grade  3 or 4 local (ocular) or systemic AEs that occur during the 12 months after 
study agent administrati on. 
7.1.2  Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary safety parameters will include the following:  
• The frequency of all AEs, including serious AEs,  
• The frequency of abnormal hematology  or clinical chemistry parameters,  
• Changes in titers of serum antibodies or  IFN-γ ELISPOT responses to RS1 . 
7.2 Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety  Parameters

 7.2.1  Adverse Events and  Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event  
The International Conference on Harmonisation  (ICH) E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines define an AE as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have  a causal relationship with this treatment.”  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.  The occur rence of an AE may 
come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews or by a study 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_12189].  All AEs must be graded for intensity and relationship to 
study product.  
An AE does  include:  
• Exacerbation o f a pre -existing illness,  
• An increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756],  
• A condition detected or diagnosed after study agent  administration even though it may 
have been present prior to the start of the study,  
• Continuo us persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline that worsen following 
the start of the study.  
An AE does not  include:  
• A medical or surgical procedure (e.g.,  surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); 
the condition that leads to the procedure  may be an AE,  
• A pre -existing disease or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that 
does not worsen,  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g.,  normal  
pregnancy, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78429], social  and/or convenience 
admissions),  
• Overdose of either study agent  or concurrent medication without any signs or symptoms.  
AEs may include pre - or post -treatment events that occur as a result o f protocol -mandated 
procedures (e.g., invasive procedures , modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
Intercurrent illnesses that occur after screening but before starting treatment, and that are not 
the result of protocol -mandated procedure s, do not need to be captured as AEs.

 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
 
 
41 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Intensity of an Adverse Event  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_688035]:  
• Mild: Events that do not interfere with daily activities  and require no medical intervent ion. 
• Moderate: Events that cause some interference with  daily activities  and may require 
simple medical interventions . 
• Severe: Events that prevent  usual daily activities  and require medical intervention .   
• Life-threatening:  Any adverse drug experience that places the subject, in the view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it  does not 
include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Fatal:  Any AE that causes the death of the subject .  Except for sudden and unexpected 
death, death is not an AE, but rather the event that caused the subject to die is the AE. 
Changes in the intensity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed.  AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Study Agent  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study agent  is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported as an AE in 
the study.  If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should 
be reported.  All AEs must have their relationship to study agent assessed using the following 
terms: associated or not associated.  “Associated with the use of the study agent ” means that 
there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_4526]  
[61].  In a clinical trial the study agent must alwa ys be suspect.  To help in assessing the 
relationship to study agent , the following guidelines are used.  
• Associated  – The event is temporally related to the administration of the study agent 
and no other etiology explains the event.  
• Not Associated  – The ev ent is temporally independent of study agent and/or the event 
appears to be explained by [CONTACT_11693].  
Events assessed as being associated with study agent will be further classified as possibly, 
probably or definitely related to study agent.  
Events as sessed as being not associated with study agent will be further classified as probably 
not or definitely not related to study agent .

42 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Intravitreal Injection  Procedure  
All AEs will also be assessed for their relationship to the intravitreal injection  procedure used to 
administer the study agent, using the same categories as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening.  Any AE that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  This does not  include a 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] .  This does 
not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284417] -planned surgery, unless  prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_687998] , 
• Results in p ersistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• Is an event that required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage , 
• Any other important medical events that do not result in death, are not life -threatening, or 
do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the participant and might require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the previously described outc omes.  Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring invasive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or dru g abuse.  
7.3 Reporting Procedures  
7.3.1  Adverse Events  
All AEs should be captured on the appropriate electronic case report form ( eCRF).  Information 
to be collected includes event description, date of onset, intensity, relationship to study agent , 
relationship to the intravitreal injection procedure used to administer the study agent , action 
taken, date of resolution or stabilization of the event, seriousness, and outcome  (resolved, 
ongoing or death caused by [CONTACT_84204]) .  All AEs occurring while on study must be docume nted 
and treated appropriately regardless of relationship.  All AEs will be followed until resolution, 
until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to 
follow -up.  
AGTC -RS1-[ADDRESS_933105] is screened should be 
considered as a pre -existing condition  and not reported as an AE; however, if it deteriorates at 
any time during the study it should be recorded as an AE.  
7.3.2  Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs that meet the criteria f or an SAE as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  must be reviewed and 
evaluated by a study physician  and captured on the appropriate SAE eCRF.  The SAE eCRF 
must  be complete within the following timelines:   
• Every AE with onset during or after  study agent administration that meets the protocol 
defined criterion for a designation of serious  or a DLT must be reported to the Sponsor 
by [CONTACT_688036] ’s AE eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator or study staff’s 
first knowledge of the event.   
• Entry of SAE or DLT information in the eCRF will trigger an e -mail to the Sponsor to take 
appropriate action in response to the information.  
• In any instance in which the d atabase cannot be accessed, a paper SAE form must be 
completed and faxed to the Sponsor  (at AGTC fax [PHONE_14304]) , followed by a phone 
call within 24 hours of the Investigator or study staff’s first knowledge of the event.  
A separate set of SAE eCRF pages  should be used for each SAE.  However, if at the time of 
initial reporting, multiple SAEs are present that are temporally and/or clinically related, they may 
be reported on the same SAE eCRF page.  
DLT reporting will follow the same timeline as SAE reporti ng. 
The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE 
and/or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  New or up dated information should be 
recorded on the originally completed SAE eCRF pages.   
If a subject dies during participation in the study, a copy of any post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology, should  be provided when available as an attachment to  an updated SAE eCRF 
page.  
Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested and should be provided as soon 
as possible.  
Questions about SAE reporting can be referred to Theresa Heah , MD at AGTC  telephone  
[PHONE_14305] , extension 72 41.

 7.3.3  Regulatory Reporting  
Following notification from the investigator, the sponsor will report events that are both serious 
and unexpected and that are associated with study agent to the US Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA) within the required timelines as specified in 21 CFR 312.32, i.e., fatal and 
life-threatening events within 7 calendar days (by [CONTACT_12221]) and all other SAEs in writing 
within [ADDRESS_933106] 
(IRB) at each site, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, and other site -specific committees 
according to regulatory requirements.   SAEs designated as not associated with study product 
will be reported  in a summary format to the DSMC during each between -cohort review and to 
the FDA at least annually.

A Clinical Research Associate  (CRA) will be assigned to monitor the investigational site and will 
be given full authorization to contac t and visit the investigational site as required to verify 
adherence to the protocol and any amendments, the completeness, accuracy and consistency 
of the data, adherence to ICH GCP guidelines, and to ensure that all applicable regulatory 
requirements are being met.  
An initiation meeting will be conducted at which the protocol and the data collection procedures 
will be reviewed with the relevant members of the site investigational team.  Throughout the 
course of the study the CRA  will maintain regular conta ct with the site investigational team and 
will visit the site at regular intervals appropriate to the subject recruitment rate and the volume 
and quality of the data.  Monitoring visits to the site will be arranged in advance with the relevant 
members of t he site investigational team.  
In particular, the CRA  will undertake the following activities on a regular basis at the site, as 
appropriate to the study and recruitment status at the site:  
• Review of subject recruitment,  
• Review of eCRFs,  
• Verification of study data against source data,  
• Collection of study data,  
• Ensure appropriate reporting and follow -up of SAEs,  
• Review of site files and study -related documentation,  
• Inspection of storage, stock levels and accountability for all study materi als, 
• Ensure investigational team and facilities remain suitable and adequate for the conduct 
of the study,  
• Identification and resolution of any study -related queries or problems.

AGTC -RS1-[ADDRESS_933119] not been treated with any carbonic anhydrase 
inhibitor within the 3 months prior to Day 0 (study agent administrat ion).    
10.4 Study Hypotheses  
The null hypothes is for safety  is that there will be no dose -limiting toxicity.  The null hypothesis  
for efficacy endpoints  is that there will be no biological activity at the dosage levels tested . 
10.5 Sample Size Considerations  
A sam ple size of 3 participants per group is typi[INVESTIGATOR_687999] 
1/[ADDRESS_933120] 
9 participants, the 95% confidence interval for the rate of dose -limitin g toxicity would be from 
0 to 33.63 %, and if no dose -limitin g toxicity is detected among the maximum  of 27  participants 
in the study, the 95% confidence interval for the rate of dose -limiting toxicity would be from 
0 to 12.77%, .   
10.6 Participant Enrollment and Follow -Up 
Enrollment will begin with Group  1A and will proceed to subsequent groups after review of 
safety data by  [CONTACT_6802].  After review of safety da ta from Group  1A, participants  will be 
enrolled  in Group s 1B and  2 concurrently .  After review of safety da ta from Groups  1A, 1B  and

to inflammation, pediatric participant s (age 6 -17) in this study will first be treated at the middle 
dose (Group 2A) prior to the enrollment at Group 4.    
Enrolled p articipants will have frequent follow -up visits during the first year af ter study agent 
administration.   To monitor for delayed AEs and assess the duration of any visual changes that 
occur, participants will be followed annually for an additional  4 years  after the Month 12 visit .  
10.7 Analysis Plan  
Due to the small  sample size within each treatment group, no inferential comparisons among 
groups are planned.  
When the use of descriptive statistics to assess group characteristics or differences is required, 
the following methods will be used: for categorical variables,  the number and percent in each

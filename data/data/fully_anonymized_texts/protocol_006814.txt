presented as risk differences and relative risks with 95% 
confidence intervals. Outcomes measured at multip le time 
points will be analyzed using regression  based on a generalized 
estimating equations (GEE) approach.  Balance on 
demographics and baseline characteristics will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_33072] (difference in means or  
proportions divided by [CONTACT_33073]) between  
groups. An absolute value of 0.2 or greater will be interpreted as 
more  imbalance than would be expected by [CONTACT_3364] (Austin 
2009).  All analyses will be performed on an intention  to treat 
basis.

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
Over 500,000 total hip art hroplasty (THA) procedures were performed in the [LOCATION_002] 
in 2014 [1]. Recent mortality trends  associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_33051] [2]. Pain management after THA remains  
problematic and opi[INVESTIGATOR_33052]. For example, after THA, 90 mg oral 
morphine equivalents (OME) was taken over  postoperative days (POD) 0 -2 despi[INVESTIGATOR_33053] [3]. This high level of opi[INVESTIGATOR_33054], as THA patients receiving a periarticular  injection in lieu of epi[INVESTIGATOR_33055] 51% more opi[INVESTIGATOR_33056] [3].  Acetaminophen 
allows for reduced administration of perioperative  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] [4]. Although acetaminophen has 
traditionally been  administered orally, an intravenous (IV) preparation has recen tly become 
available. IV acetaminophen after major orthopedic surgery  provides effective analgesia and 
reduces morphine administration  by 33%, compared to placebo [5]. When compared to oral  
acetaminophen, IV administration has earlier and greater blood -brain barrier penetration and 
twice the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_33057] 6 hours [6]. Thus, IV acetaminophen  
could have improved analgesic effects compared to oral. However,  it is not clear whether IV 
acetaminophen has clinical benefits, suc h as reduced pain or opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444], over oral 
acetaminophen for THA  patients. A recent meta -analysis found IV acetaminophen provided  
no clinical benefit over oral for total joint arthroplasty [7].  In the study protocol, opi[INVESTIGATOR_33058], in order to promote minimal use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. We  
hypothesized that IV acetaminophen  would reduce 1 or more of the  following 3 primary 
outcomes: (1) pain with activity on POD 1; (2)  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] ( cumulative, POD 0  POD 3); and 
(3) opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -relate d side  effects (POD 1).

Version Date: 3-28-[ADDRESS_32311] DESCRIPTION  
 
Enrolled patients received either IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev,  Mallinckro dt Pharmaceuticals) 
and an oral placebo or oral acetaminophen  and an IV placebo in a randomized, blinded 
fashion.  Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio in blocks of size 6 and 8 via  a computer -
generated randomization schedule (using SAS version  9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) by a 
statistician not otherwise involved  in the trial. Pharmacists dispensed the study medication. 
Patients,  physicians, and research assistants were blinded throughout the  study.  
3.0 OBJECTIVE OF CLINICAL STUDY  
 
 
Pain after total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an active field of investigation at HSS. THA is 
frequently performed at HSS, and patients are  often managed with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_33062]. IV acetaminophen has favorable kinetics compared to oral, and may 
improve  pain outcomes.  If there is a clinically meaningful b enefit to IV acetaminophen then 
IV acetaminophen may be more widely used in THA pa tients in  particular, and among 
orthopedic pa tients in general.  
4.0 STUDY HYPOTHESES  
 
1. There will be a difference in pain with activity (POD 1) between patients who receive 
IV vs. oral acetaminophen.  
2. There will be a difference in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (cumulative, POD 0 POD  3) between patients 
who receive IV vs. oral acetaminophen.  
3. There will be a difference in opi[INVESTIGATOR_33063]. 
oral acetaminophen.

9.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
 
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human s tudy participant, including 
any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or 
not considered related to participation in the r esearch.  
 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
Any adverse event that:  
 Results in death  
 Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death f rom the  event 
as it occurred  
 Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
 Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant  hazards  
 
9.3 Adverse Event Reporting   
All AEs are collected on an Adverse Event Form, eithe r in paper or electronic format . All AEs 
experienced by [CONTACT_33075] (e.g., from the 
start of intervention through the end of the study) are to be reported, as outlined in the 
protocol. The reporting requirements to the IRB, to the NIA and to the FDA (in case of drug 
and device studies) may differ and must be complied with. Please note that the AE form

Any information collected electronically wi ll be stored on the REDCap server. The REDCap 
server and data are hosted by [CONTACT_33076], with the servers physically 
located in the Payson building of Weill Cornell [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307]. Access  
to this space is limited to m embers of the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s informatics department. Electronically, 
several intrusion protection mechanisms,  including firewalls and encryption, are in place to 
protect the server and its data. Any paper based data sheets utilized for the study will be  
stripp ed of all personal identifiers whenever possible and stored the department’s locked 
office.  
 
All patients will be identified by a specific study number. Any patient information taken from 
medical records will be kept strictly  confidential. Only the previously mentioned investigators 
will have access to this information. Thus our research presents a minimal risk of  harm to 
subjects’ privacy.

review study records and/or data.  Data will be released to Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (the 
study sponsor) and the project’s statistician, at designated intervals, including  interim 
analys is (if appropriate) and at end of study. Any identifiers not essential for data analysis 
will be removed from the data set, which  will be sent to the statistician as a password 
protected, encrypted file.  After data analysis, the study data set will be st ored as an Excel or 
SPSS file. A unique feature of REDCap is that data fields marked as  protected health 
information (PHI) can be automatically de -identified  when data is exported. We will utilize 
this option when closing out the  study after data analysis, so that no identifiers remain in the 
stored Excel or SPSS data set. In the REDCap program, the study will be  changed from 
production mode to archive mode. This means the data and study forms will no longer  be 
accessible to REDCap users. Only the research a ssistant and research manager will have 
rights to unarchive the study. The study will be maintained in REDCap for the period  of time 
required by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307]/federal regulations, at which point it will be deleted.  
 Access to the REDCap program is passwor d protected, and access to a specific 
study’s information within the program is limited to the  research assistant and other IRB 
approved study personnel who have been given permission to view and/or enter study data. 
REDCap  program access is authorized by [CONTACT_23191]; particular study access is granted by 
[CONTACT_17033]. For data exports, fields marked  as protected health information (PHI) 
in REDCap will be de -identified,  if feasible. All transmission of data will occur via encrypted 
networks  and in pas sword protected files. Any paper based data sheets utilized for the study 
will have personal identifiers removed whenever  possible and will be stored in the 
department’s locked office. Each subject will be assigned a unique study number for 
identification,  and that number will not be derived from or related to information about the

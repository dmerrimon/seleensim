Title  A Phase 2/3, Open- Label, Repeat -Dose Study of the Pharmacokinetics, 
Efficacy, and Safety of Prometic Plasminogen Intravenous Infusion in 
Subjects with Hypoplasminogenemia  
Study Design  Multicenter, open- label, uncontrolled, repeat -dose 
Indication  Systemic treatment of Type I plasminogen deficiency 
(hypoplasminogenemia)  
Phase  2/3 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735])  
Investigational 
Medicinal Product  Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous (IV), lyophilized material reconstituted with Water for Injection to produce a sterile suspension with a concentration of 5.5 mg/mL  
Objectives  Primary objectives:  
• To achieve an increase of individual trough plasminogen acti vity

at least [ADDRESS_277649] documented i ndividual PK profiles with the 
sponsor  (e.g., due to participation in the previous  Phase 1 study  and received 
6 mg/kg Plasminogen) do not need to undergo Segment 1 and can proceed 
directly to Segment  2. 
Screening  
Subjects  will be screened  for study eligibility  within  a period of no more  than 
21 days before the start of dosing. Subjects will enter either Segment 1 or 2, 
depending on the availability of their prior individual PK  profile.  
Segment 1  
For subjects undergoing Segment 1, each will receive a single dose of 
6.6mg/kg Plasminogen IV infusion on Day -4. Blood samples for PK 
analysis will be drawn prior to infusion and subsequently through [ADDRESS_277650]’s baseline plasminogen  
activity  and antigen  as well as D-dimer  levels.  The last PK sample  ([ADDRESS_277651] infusion) will be withdrawn on Week 1, Day 0, before the 
administration of the first dose in Segment 2. The resulting PK profile will 
be used to determine each subject’s dosing interval in Segment  2. 
Segment  2 
Based  on individual  PK profiles, subjects  will receive 6.6 mg/kg 
Plasminogen IV infusion every second, third, or fourth day for [ADDRESS_277652]’s PK profile on file. 
Subjects who have gone through Segment [ADDRESS_277653]’s  individual  PK profile  becomes  available, 
his or her dosing interval will be adjusted to every second, third, or fourth  
day accordingly.  
The first  dose of Plasminogen  IV infusion  in this segment  will 
beadministered at the study site on Week 1, Day 0. Subjects will visi t the 
study sites every [ADDRESS_277654] 
(IMP) infusion at the study site. The infusions between study visits can be 
administered  at the study site or an ancillary  site by [CONTACT_230657]: [ZIP_CODE]

Version [ADDRESS_277655]’s  home by a home health  nurse, by [CONTACT_423] (i.e., self - 
administration), or by a caregiver/family  member  (US subjects  only). 
Subjects or caregivers may be trained for IMP administration as deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_737] (US subjects only). The final dose at the 
Week 12 visit (or at study discontinuation)  in Segment  [ADDRESS_277656] be 
administered at the study site to allow for a repeat PK profile.  
Plasma samples will be drawn before IMP administration every 2 weeks to 
measure the trough  levels  of plasminogen activity  and antigen  and D-dimer. 
The samples  will be obtained at each study  visit at Weeks  4, 8 and 12 and by 
a home  health  nurse  at Weeks  2, 6, and 10. Additional  samples  may be taken 
in addition if needed.  
Subjects will undergo clinical assessments of the disease at each study visit 
depending on the system and organ involvement of hypoplasminogenemia 
and the characteristics of lesions, including but not limited to: photographic 
measurements of visible lesions (e.g., ocular, gingival), spi[INVESTIGATOR_230626], and imaging study of nonvisible 
lesions (e.g., oropharyngeal, ureteral, bronchial), as deemed appropriate by 
[CONTACT_093].  
Safety assessments will include vital signs, physical exam ination, clinical 
laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, fibrinogen and 
coagulation panels, and urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing 
potential), AE assessments, virology, and immunogenicity.  
In addition, subjects will be given a dia ry to record infusions, symptoms, 
concomitant medications and AEs at home between visits.  
At the end of Segment 2, subjects will have the option to participate in 
Segment 3. Subjects for whom there is no perceived or anticipated benefit  
from  further dosing would  not be enrolled  in Segment  3 at the investigator’s 
discretion and based on discussion with the Safety Monitoring Committee  
(SMC, see Section 3.7) and the  sponsor.  
Any subject who discontinues the study during or at the end of Segment [ADDRESS_277657] licensing or study 
termination by [CONTACT_230658]. The dose will 
be 6.6 mg/kg with the frequency determined during Segment 2, with the 
option of modification based on clinical response and plasminogen trough  
levels. Subjects (or their caregivers) may be trained to self-administer the 
IMP at home if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. 
Subjects will return to the study sites for assessments every 3 months to 
monitor  subjects’  clinical  status  and plasminogen trough levels.  Subjects  will 
be given a diary to record the dates of IMP administration, any AEs, 
concomitant  medication  and other  relevant  information.  Subjects  will be

in Segment 3 will be allowed to enroll in Treatment Protocol 2002C018G  
and continue ongoing IMP treatment without any break in treatment. If 
subjects decide to enter Treatment Protocol 2002C018G, then they will 
return to the study site and complete the End of Study visit and sign an 
informed consent/assent for that study and stop participation in the current  
study. If subjects decide to not enter Treatment Protocol 2002C018G, then 
they will stop IMP and return to the study site for a Safety Follow -up visit 
[ADDRESS_277659]  who experiences  any of the following  occurrences  will suspend 
the IMP treatment until further  assessments:  
• Anaphylactic response to study drug  administration  
• A significant AE that, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], necessitates  
suspension of treatment  
• Confirmed  presence of neutralizing  antibodies (in at least 2 
measurements) in association with diminished plasminogen activity 
that obviates the potential benefit of plasminogen replacement  
thera py 
• Thrombotic or uncontrolled bleeding event requiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_230627] 
a subject should stop treatment, or if there are unforeseen events (e.g., 
thromboembolic event) that would warr ant halting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. 
Such an event will be discussed with FDA before enrolling further subjects.  
Duration  For each subject, the estimated duration of study participation is no more 
than 21 days for screening, 4 days for Segment 1, 12 weeks for Segment 2, 
and 40 weeks (36 weeks Treatment and 4 weeks Safety Follow -up) for 
subjects who participate in Segment [ADDRESS_277660]  approval,  subjects  at the US site will be allowed  to enroll  in 
Treatment Protocol 2002C018G and continue ongoing IMP treatment 
without any break in treatment. If subjects decide to enter Treatment 
Protocol  2002C018G, then they will return  to the study site and complete  the 
End of Study visit and sign an informed conse nt/assent for that study and 
stop participation in the current study. If subjects decide to not enter 
Treatment Protocol 2002C018G, then they will stop IMP and return to the 
study site for a Safety Follow -up visit 30 days after the final IMP dose.

Administration & 
Dosage  IMP Preparation  
Plasminogen  (Human)  Intravenous  lyophilized material will be reconstituted 
with sterile Water for Injection to yield a solution of 5.5 mg/mL for IV 
infusion.  
Infusion  
Only eligible and enrolled subject s will receive IMP. The entire dose of the 
Plasminogen IV solution should be calculated on the basis of each  subject’s 
body weight and infused over 10 to 30 minutes.  
Dose and Dosing Interval  
In Segment 1, a single dose of 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen will be administered 
to each subject. However, subjects who have documented individual PK 
profiles with the sponsor (e.g., due to participation in the previous Phase 1 
study  and received  6.6 mg/kg  Plasminogen)  do not need to undergo Segme nt 
1 and can proceed directly to Segment  2. 
In Segment  2, repeated  doses  of 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen  will be administered 
every second, third, or fourth day, depending on individual PK profile. 
Subjects  will receive  a range  of [ADDRESS_277661] or legal guardian has provided informed consent (as well as 
assent by [CONTACT_230659] [IRB]  guidelines).  
2. Subject  is male  or female  between  the ages of 2 and 80 years  (inclusive).  
3. Subject has a documented history of lesions and symptoms consistent  
with a diagnosis of hypoplasminogenemia.  
4. Subject has plasminogen activity level ≤ 45%.  
5. Subject has documented vaccination to hepatitis A virus (HAV) and 
hepatitis  B virus  (HBV),  or has received  the first dose of HAV and HBV 
vaccine prior to the first dose of IMP and is scheduled to receive the 
second vaccine dose. If subject has documented vaccination more than 
1 year before  screening  but has a negative  antibody titer to HAV and/or 
HBV at screening, subject is required to begin a re-vaccination series  
with the first dose of HAV and/or HBV vaccine prior to the first dose 
of IMP and is scheduled to receive the second vaccine dose. No 
revaccination is required if the documented vaccination took place 
within [ADDRESS_277662] dose of study  treatment  (unless  documented as 
biologically or surgically sterile (e.g., postmenopausal, vasectomized), 
or has not reached reproductive  age.

Criteria of 
Evaluation  Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be drawn and analyzed for plasminogen activity and plasminogen antigen levels using validated assays at a central laboratory.  
Segment 1  
Blood samples are drawn on Day - 4 before the IMP infusion to establish 
baseline levels for plasminoge n activity, antigen, and D -dimer and at the 
following time points after the end of the infusion: between 5 and 15 
minutes,  6 hours  (± 30 minutes),  24 hours  (± 2 hours, Day -3), 48 hours  (± 
2 hours, Day -2), 72 hours  (± 2 hours, Day -1), and 96 hours  (± 2 hours,

 Day 0). An individual PK profile will be developed based on these time 
points. 
Subjects who have had individual PK profile for 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen 
with the sponsor, due to participation in the prior Phase [ADDRESS_277668] dose of the IMP is given, to establish the baseline  levels.  
For all subjects, blood samples will be drawn every 2 weeks before IMP 
infusion to measure trough levels through the final dose. 
A full PK profile will also be done for all subjects at the end of Segment 2 (Week  12 visit)  to evaluate the stability  of individual  PK profile  after [ADDRESS_277669]’s PK profile may be altered by 
[CONTACT_2671] 12-
week treatment period. At the Week 12 visit, blood 
samples are drawn before the IMP infusion and at the following time 
points after the end of the infusion: between 5 and 15 minutes, 6 hours (± 
30 minutes), 24 hours (± 2 hours), 48 hours (± 2 hours), 72 hours (± 2 hours), and 96 hours  (± 2 hours, Day 0). The PK profile  will be developed 
for each subject and compared with his or her prior PK  profile(s).  
Furthermore, additional PK analyses may be performed at other time 
points during Segment [ADDRESS_277670]’s trough level 
or antibody test suggests the appearance of neutralizing antibody against the IMP.  
Segment 3  
Blood samples will be drawn at each study visit every 3 months before IMP infusion to measure trough levels. 
Efficacy:  
All subjects will be clinically evaluated by [CONTACT_230661]. 
• Visible  lesions (ocular, gingival) will be evaluated using 
photographs. 
• Nonvisible lesions (e.g., ureteral, oropharyngeal, and bronchial) 
may be evaluated via imaging studies, such as computed 
tomography [CT] scans, X -ray, or other imaging techniques, as 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737].  
• Functionality of affected organs may be assessed as deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_230628]: [ZIP_CODE]

Safety Assessments Physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests will be 
assessed at each study visit.  
Virology will be assessed  at Screening,  Baseline,  and every  [ADDRESS_277671] AEs and infusions between visits.  
All treatment- emergent AEs and SAEs will be documented, including 
assessments of their severity and relatedness to the IMP.  
Laboratory abnormalities, physical examination findings, and vital sign 
abnormalities that are clinically significant, as judged by [CONTACT_093], will be reported as AEs.  
Statistical Methods  Analysis datasets  
Safety population:  Includes any subject who receives at least one dose of 
the IMP and provides safety data for at least one non- screening visit. 
PK population:  Includes  any subject  who has completed  Segment  [ADDRESS_277672] provided sufficient samples for PK  assessments.  
Full Analysis  Set (FAS) : Includes  any subject  who receives  at least [ADDRESS_277673] an absolute 
10% (10 U/dL) from the subject’s individual baseline level. Baseline is defined  as the plasminogen activity  level  measured  before  the first dose of 
IMP at Segment 1, Day -

 The secondary PK endpoints include individual PK profiles at the end of 
Segment 2, compared with their PK profiles at baseline, and trough 
plasminogen activity  and antigen  levels  during Segment  2 and Segment  3. 
Plasminogen activity and antigen levels will be presented by [CONTACT_230662] (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation [SD], coefficient of variation [CV], medium, 
minimum,  maximum,  geometric  mean  and associated  CV).  Individual  and 
median profiles of the concentration- time data will be plotted using 
nominal  times.  Median  profiles  may be presented  on both linear -linear  and 
linear -log scales.  
Standard  PK parameters,  including area under  the curve  (AUC),  clearance 
(CL), mea n residence time (MRT), volume of distribution (V d) and 
terminal half -life (t 1/2) will be calculated using non- compartmental 
analysis and baseline -adjusted plasminogen activity levels derived from 
Segment [ADDRESS_277675]’s potential response to therapy.  
Safety Analysis  
For analysis of safety and tolerability, TEAEs and SAEs will be 
summarized descriptively. Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, 
biochemistry, urinalysis, fibrinolysis/coagulation) will be presented in 
summary  and shift tables.  The numbers  of subjects  who had changes  from 
baseline in viral tests and immunogenicity tests will be presented in 
individual subject listings and summary  tables.  
Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is:  
Overall clinical success in number and size of lesions as measured by  
[CONTACT_230663] 48 weeks  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are  
• Overall  clinical  success  in number  and size of lesions  as measured 
by [CONTACT_230664] 12 
weeks  
• CGI scores at 12 and 48 weeks  
• Quality of life scores at 12 and 48 weeks

 Clinical success is considered achieved if 50% of subjects with visible or 
other measureable lesions demonstrate at least a 50% improvement in 
lesion number/size or functionality impact from baseline at 12 and/or 48 
weeks. Visible lesions are defined as le sions which can imaged and 
analyzed with digital photography. Other measureable lesions are  defined 
as lesions whose dimensions can be assessed by [CONTACT_230665] 
(e.g., computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, 
etc.) or organ sp ecific functional assessments (e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], 
audiogram, oximetry, etc.).  
All efficacy results will be presented descriptively by [CONTACT_66719], 
including summarized hypoplasminogenemia symptoms over time 
recorded in subject  diaries.  
The small sam ple size and high variability of disease presentation do not 
allow formal statistical analyses.

 1 Introduction 
1.1 Background  
 
1.1.1  Overview of Hypoplasminogenemia  
 
Hypoplasminogenemia is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that leads to a variety of 
significant clinical manifestations primarily associated with fibrous depositions on mucous membranes  throughout  the body (Schott  et al., 1998). Plasminogen is a naturally  occurring protein 
that is synthesized by [CONTACT_230666]. Plasminogen is activated to form plasmin, an enzymatic component of the fibrinolytic system and is the main enzyme involved in 
the lysis of clots  and clearance of extravasated  fibrin  (Collen  et al., 1991). Plasmin  is also involved 
in wound healing, cell migration, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis and embryogenesis (Castellino 
et al., 2005). 
Hypoplasminogenemia is a multisystem disease that can affect the eyes, ears, nasal and oral 
cavities,  sinuses,  tracheobronchial  tree, genitourinary tract,  gastrointestinal tract,  and gingiva.  The 
most common clinical manifestation of hypoplasminogenemia is ligneous conjunctivitis, which is 
characterized by [CONTACT_159637], woody (ligneous) growths on the conjunctiva of the eye. If left untreated, ligneous  conjunctivitis  can lead to blindness.  Most  affected  cases  are infants  and children  showing 
their first clinical  manifestation  at a median  age of approximately 10 months  (Schuster  et al., 2007; 
Bateman et al ., 1986). Ligneous conjunctivitis is believed to be triggered by [CONTACT_230667], 
injury, irritation or inflammation, and various surgical interventions into the eye (Schuster et al., 
2003). 
In addition to ligneous conjunctivitis, hypoplasminogenemia can cause tracheobronchial lesions 
including abnormal  membranes  with poor pulmonary toilette  that can result  in chronic  obstruction 
of the affected pulmonary segment or even respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. H ydrocephalus occurs in 
approximately 10% of children with severe hypoplasminogenemia, apparently related to the 
deposition of fibrin in the cerebral ventricular system; treatment may require implantation of a 
shunt which can be complicated by [CONTACT_230668]. Severely impaired 
skin- wound healing has also been reported (Schott et al ., 1998).  
Hypoplasminogenemia  is listed  as a rare disease by [CONTACT_154108]  (NIH) Office 
of Rare Diseases Research. Prevalence for hypoplasminogenemia is estimated at approximately 
1.6 per 1,000,000 (Tefs et al ., 2006). 
1.1.2  Current Treatment for  Hypoplasminogenemia  
There are 2 forms of plasminogen: Glu and Lys. Most literature references of  plasminogen 
replacement therapy are based on the Lys form; it is important to note the Prometic plasminogen

 is the Glu form,  which  has a longer  half-life (approximately  2.5 days in healthy  subjects)  than Lys- 
plasminogen (0.8 days) (Collen e t al., 1991; Claeys et al ., 1973). 
Attempted treatments for ligneous conjunctivitis lesions include: surgical removal; high dose 
intravenous corticosteroid treatment; topi[INVESTIGATOR_230629], corticosteroids and alpha - 
chymotrypsin, or cyclosporine;  azathioprine; and hyaluronidase. These treatments are not 
consistently or completely successful in either the treatment or the prevention of lesion regrowth (Schuster  et al., 2007;  DeCock  et al., 1995;  Silva  et al., 2006;  Rubin et al., 1991). After  treatment, 
including surgical removal, the lesions will usually recur. Local administration of fresh frozen 
plasma (which contains plasminogen) and other plasminogen- containing eye drops, however, has 
shown effectiveness in treating eye lesions of ligneous  conjunctivitis (Heidemann et al ., 2003). 
Furthermore, continued topi[INVESTIGATOR_230630]- containing eye drops can treat the 
lesion and prevent regrowth. Other research shows that systemic administration of plasminogen concentrates results in partial resolution of the lesions (Schott et al., 1998; Kraft et al., 2000). A 
6-month- old child treated with Lys -plasminogen preparation as a continuous infusion and later as 
daily bolus injections led to complete regression of ligneous conjunctivitis wit hin [ADDRESS_277689] as well as skin wound healing (Schott et al., 1998). Currently, there is no plasminogen replacement product approved for the treatment 
of plasminogen deficiency in the  US. 
1.2 Pre-clinical Experience with  Plasminogen  
 
A literature review revealed the following information regarding work done in plasminogen deficient animal models. Bugge et al. (1995) generated the first plasminogen- deficient 
homozygous ( PLG 
-/-) knockout mouse model to study the physiological role of plasminogen in 
development, hemostasis,  and reproduction. The PLG  -/- mice  completed  embryonic  development, 
survived to adulthood and were fertile. However, the PLG -/- mice were predisposed to severe 
thrombosis, and young a nimals exhibited thrombotic lesions in the liver, stomach, rectum, lungs, 
pancreas and other tissues. Further histological examination of the mice between [ADDRESS_277690] compared to controls. The authors concluded that plasminogen plays a critical role in 
fibrinolysis and hemostasis.  
Ploplis et al. (1995) also generated homozygous knockout mice to investigate the effects of 
plasminogen disruption on thrombosis, growth, viability, and fertility in mice. Plasminogen-  
deficient mice survived embryonic development but developed spontaneous fibrin deposit ion due 
to impaired thrombolysis, suffered retarded growth (weighing significantly less than control and heterozygous knockouts), and had reduced fertility and survival. Approximately 20% of the homozygous Pg
-/- mice developed rectal prolapse. Histological  examination revealed fibrin 
deposits in the liver, lungs, and stomach, associated with gastric ulcers in 6 to 12 weeks old Pg-/-

 mice, but not in the controls or heterozygous littermates. These PLG -/- mice displayed a reduced 
capacity to di ssolve spontaneous pulmonary plasma clots within [ADDRESS_277691] 
prominent phenotype of plasminogen- deficient mice appears to be related to fibrin homeostasis; 
some of the lesions, such as gastric ulcers, indicated that the plasminogen system may play a role 
in the prevention and/or healing of tissue damage.  
Bugge et al. (1996) also investigated the effects of combined homozygous plasminogen and 
fibrinogen deficiencies in mice by [CONTACT_230669]- binding protein ( FIB) genes. The double -deficient mice ( PLG -/- and FIB-/-) exhibited 
similar phenotypic survival patterns to control animals. These results demonstrate that the lack of 
fibrinogen prevents animals from early morbidity and premature death associated with a PLG -/- 
deficiency.  The authors  concluded that the fundam ental,  and possibly only, essential  physiological 
role of plasminogen is  fibrinolysis. 
Lijnen et al. (1996) administered bolus injections of purified mouse plasminogen to PLG -/- mice 
and showed that the levels of plasminogen antigen and activity were incr eased to normal levels. 
Moreover, plasminogen  administration  was associated  with significant  restoration  of thrombolytic 
potential and markedly reduced fibrin deposition in the liver after 24 hours of  treatment.  
These studies in the plasminogen knockout mi ce (PLG /-) confirm the fundamental role of 
plasminogen in fibrinolysis  and help establish  the scientific  understanding of the symptoms/lesions 
associated with plasminogen deficiency in humans. However, systemic administration of human plasminogen to plasminogen knockout  mice  would result  in the development  of cross -species  anti- 
human antibodies  in mice,  making the mouse  model  impractical  for studying the pharmacology of 
human plasminogen. No other suitable animal models for studying systemic treatment of 
plasminogen deficiency have yet been identified.  
1.3 Clinical Experience with  Plasminogen  
 
Prometic Biotherapeutics, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the sponsor), is developi[INVESTIGATOR_230631] 
(Human) Intravenous Lyophilized Solution (the investigational medicinal product [IMP]), for the treatment  of hypoplasminogenemia. The IMP is derived from  pooled plasma  donated by [CONTACT_230670].  
The clinical development program for Plasminogen (Human) in subjects with hypoplasminogenemia  consists of a completed  Phase  1, single -ascending -dose study in adolescent 
and ad ult subjects (2002C005G), an ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 2/3 repeat dose study in pediatric and 
adult subjects (2002C011G), and supportive data from [ADDRESS_277692], repeat -dose, 
Expanded Access studies (2002C013G, 2002C016G, and 2002C017G). In the Phas e 1 study 
2002C005G, 5 subjects received a single IV infusion of Plasminogen (2 mg/kg) and 7 subjects received a single IV infusion of Plasminogen (6.0 mg/kg). Both doses were well  tolerated.

Version [ADDRESS_277693] an initial dose of 4 mg/kg the IMP, which was 
increased to 6 mg/kg and then 6.5 mg/kg every second day. The patient was extubated within a 
matter of days. To date, no adverse events (AEs) associated with administration of Plasminogen have been observed.  
In the current study, an interim analysis was perf ormed after the first 10 subjects completed 12 
weeks of treatment with a data cutoff at 30 November 2016. All 10 of these subjects achieved target PK trough levels demonstrating the ability of Prometic’s Plasminogen (Human) to serve as effective replacemen t therapy. Preliminary efficacy evaluation at 12 weeks revealed that 13 of 14 
visible lesions had resolved, and the remaining lesion had improved from 15 × 5 mm at baseline to too small to be measured at 12 weeks. There were no recurrences and no new lesions during 
this period of observation. There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug. The most frequent AEs were headache and 
nasopharyngitis. Nausea, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], back pain, pain in extremity, 
and hematuria were also frequent in adult subjects, and upper abdominal pain and cough were frequent AEs in pediatric subjects. A US Biologics Licensing Application was submitted based 
on these interim data; this application is und er review. As of 14Dec2017 study enrollment is 
complete and all [ADDRESS_277694] s

1.4 Benefit Versus Risk and Study Rationale  
 
The prognosis of hypopla sminogenemia is variable depending on the extent, location(s), length, 
and site of the lesions. A number of patients have died or have suffered loss of affected organ 
functions, such as sight and dentition, as a result of hypoplasminogenemia (Mehta and Sha pi[INVESTIGATOR_2152], 
2008). The one clearly  documented  effective  therapy that leads  to resolution  and halts  re-formation 
of ophthalmologic lesions is systemic or topi[INVESTIGATOR_230632] (Heidemann et al ., 
2003;  Watts  et al., 2002;  Pergantou et al., 2011;  Tabarra  et al., 2004). There is no effective licensed 
local or systemic plasminogen replacement ther apy available for  hypoplasminogenemia. 
Prometic is developi[INVESTIGATOR_230633]. This rare 
disease represents  an area of unmet  medical  need,  where optimal treatment  is likely  to be systemic 
replacement of plasminogen to reduce or resolve the clinical manifestations in patients and to prevent  or suppress  lesion  recurrence.  Prior to generation  of this material  by [CONTACT_230671], no purified 
Glu-plasminogen has been available for evaluation in plasminogen deficient subjects. We 
hypothesize based on pharmacokinetic data in the Phase 1 study using Glu- plasminogen that a 
trough level of >10% plasminogen activity above baseline is  achievable with every other day or 
every third day dosing. Potential clinical benefit will be assessed during Segment 2 and Segment 3 to monitor and correlate plasminogen replacement therapy with clinical response in visibly 
evident lesions. 
In support of this strategy, results from a case study indicate the benefit of repeat dosing as 
demonstrated in a named patient in [LOCATION_013] treated with Prometic’s plasminogen. The 
plasminogen deficient subject had a collapsed left lung and right lower lobe  related to viscous 
bronchial secretions and to obstructing ligneous lesions in the bronchial tree. Pharmacokinetic results for this subject showed that the trough values 10% above baseline were achieved with the 
current dosing regimen. The subject was ext ubated within a matter of days of administration of 
intravenous  Plasminogen (Human).  To date,  no adverse events  have  been  observed associated  with 
administration of Plasminogen (Human) in this  subject.  
This is a Phase 2/3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_230634] (Human) Intravenous Lyophilized 
solution.

Version [ADDRESS_277696] virus elimination/inactivation processes performed during 
manufacturing. The IMP was well tolerated in the Phase 1 single -dose study at 2 mg/kg and 6 
mg/kg. 
Addi tionally, there is a risk that subjects will develop antibodies to exogenous plasminogen since 
plasminogen deficiency  is a heterogeneous  disease  with a variety  of genetic mutations  resulting  in 
altered plasminogen protein. It is unknown if such antibodies will be neutralizing and perhaps 
interfere with the efficacy of Plasminogen (Human). The effects of potential neutralizing antibodies will be assessed during the  study. 
Given the absence of effective licensed treatment for hypoplasminogenemia, the potential 
benefits of this study to the affected population and study participants outweigh the risk of their participation.  
1.[ADDRESS_277697] 10%  above  the subject’s  baseline  level  for at  least 3 measurements  during the 12 weeks  of 
treatment  in Segment  2. Table 1 shows  the results  of a single  IV infusion of Plasminogen 6 mg/kg, 
in the 5 adult subj ects in Cohort 2 of the Phase 1 study. Red highlighted cells indicate when a 
trough level less than 10% above the baseline level was obtained at 72 or 96 hours, while orange cells indicate  a value  exceeding  but close to the desired  >10%  level.  All subjects  achieved  a trough 
level at 48 hours above the 10% level over baseline. These data are used to establish the dosing regimens in this Phase 2/3 study. For example, if Subjects 2, 6 and 7 were to enter the Phase 2/3 study, they would require dosing e very second day to routinely avoid a trough level <10% above 
baseline, while Subjects [ADDRESS_277698].  
Therefore, subjects who enter the Phase 2/3 study will be commenced on an initial regimen of  
6.6 mg/kg every 2, 3, or [ADDRESS_277699]’s individual known PK profile if they have been dosed in Cohort 2 at 6 mg/kg in the Phase 1 study. New subjects will undergo a PK study (Segment 1) with blood samples taken up to [ADDRESS_277700] -day dosing regimen at 6.6 mg/kg until their individual PK results are 
available,  at which  time dosing will tailored  accordingly  (Section  3.2). A change  in dosing interval 
to provide an increase or decrease in the trough levels may be required at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI) and the Sponsor, based on the actual results in each individual  patient.

At the end of Segment 2, subjects will be asked to participate in long- term therapy in Segment 3, 
if this is deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737], Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC), and

therapy to suppress lesion development and/or worsening disease is likely necessary for patients with a history of frequent or recurrent lesions.

2 Study  Objectives 
2.1 Primary  Objectives  
 
The primary objectives of the study are:  
• To achieve an increase of individual trough plasminogen activity by [CONTACT_230656] 
10% (i.e., 10 U/dL) from baseline in adult and pediatric subjects with hypoplasminogenemia during the 12 weeks of plasminogen replacement therapy in Segment 2;  and 
• To evaluate the efficacy of plasminogen replacement therapy on clinically evident or 
visible symptoms of hypoplasminogenemia during the 48 weeks of dosing in Segments 2 and 3. 
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
 
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of plasminogen replacement therapy during the 48 
weeks of dosing;  and 
• To evaluate the efficacy of plasminogen replacement therapy on clinically evident or 
visible symptoms o f hypoplasminogenemia during the 12 weeks of dosing in Segment 2; 
and 
• To evaluate the effect of plasminogen replacement therapy on pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity during the [ADDRESS_277704] who completes 
Segment 2 of plasminogen replacement therapy (see below) of the study and provides at least [ADDRESS_277705]  documented  individual  PK profiles  with the sponsor  (e.g.,  due to participation  in the previous

 Screening  
Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within a period of no more than 21 days before the 
start of dosing. Subjects will enter either Segment 1 or 2, depending on the availability of their 
prior individual PK profile. 
Segment 1  
For subjects undergoing Segment 1, each will receive a single dose of 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen IV 
infusion on Day - 4. Blood samples for PK analysis will be drawn prior to infusion and 
subsequently through [ADDRESS_277706]’s baseline plasminogen activity and 
antigen as well as D-dimer levels. The last PK sample ([ADDRESS_277707] infusion) will be withdrawn 
on Week 1, Day 0, before the administration of the first dos e in Segment 2. The resulting PK 
profile will be used to determine each subject’s dosing interval in Segment 2. 
Segment 2  
Based on individual PK profiles, subjects will receive 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen IV infusion every 
second, third, or fourth day for [ADDRESS_277708]’s PK profile 
on file. 
Subjects  who have  gone  through Segm ent [ADDRESS_277709]’s individual PK profile becomes 
available,  his or her dosing  interval  will be adjusted  to every second, third, or fourth  day accordingly.  
The first dose of Plasminogen  IV infusion in this segment  will be administered  at the study site on 
Week 1, Day 0. Subjects will visit the study sites every [ADDRESS_277710]’s home by a home health nurse, by [CONTACT_423] 
(i.e., self -administration), or by a caregiver/family member (US subjects only). Subjects or 
caregivers may be trained for IMP administration as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737] (US 
subjects only). Subjects administering IMP at home (home administration in the US only) are not 
required to take vital signs with the infusion. Vi tals for home administration subjects will only be 
taken when the nurse draws trough levels (Week 2, 6, and 10) and when the subject returns to the site for visits  (Week  4, 8, and 12) and every  12 weeks  thereafter  in Segment  3. The final dose at

 the Week  12 visit (or at study discontinuation)  in Segment  [ADDRESS_277711]  be administered  at the study site 
to allow for a repeat PK  profile.  
Plasma samples will be drawn before IMP administration every 2 weeks to measure the trough 
levels of plasminogen activity and antigen and D -dimer. The samples will be obtained at each 
study visit at Weeks 4, 8 and 12 and by a home health nurse at Weeks 2, 6 and 10. Additional samples may be taken in addition if needed.  
Subjects will undergo clinical assessments of the disease at each study visit depending on the system and organ involvement of hypoplasminogenemia and the characteristics of lesions, 
including but not limited  to: photographic  measurements  of visible  lesions  (e.g., ocular, gingival), 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_230635], and imaging study of nonvisible lesions 
(e.g., oropharyngeal, ureteral, bronchial), as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_11168]. 
Safety assessments will include vital signs, physical examination,  clinical laboratory tests 
(hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, fibrinogen and coagulation panels, and urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential), AE assessments, virology, and immunogenicity. 
In addition, subjects  will be given a diary  to record infusions, symptoms,  concomitant  medications 
and AEs at home between  visits.  
At the end of Segment 2, subjects will have the option to participate in Segment 3. Subjects for 
whom there is no perceived or anticipated benefit from further dosing would not be enrolled in 
Segment 3 at the investigator’s discretion and based on discussion with the Safety Monitoring 
Committee (SMC, see Section 3.7) and the sponsor. 
Any subject who discontinues the study during or at the end of Segment [ADDRESS_277712] licensing or study termination by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor for subjects 
in the [LOCATION_002]. The dose will be 6.6 mg/kg with the frequency determined during Segment 
2, with the option of modification based on clinical response and plasminogen trough levels. 
Subjects (or their caregivers) may be trained to self -administer the IMP at home if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. 
Subjects  will return  to the study sites  for assessments every  3 months  to monitor  subjects’  clinical 
status and plasminogen trough levels. Subjects will be given a diary to record the dates of IMP 
administration,  any AEs,  concomitant  medication  and other  relevant  information. Subjects  will be 
given instructions for how to document receipt of IMP and how to return all used IMP  vials.

3.2 Treatment, Dosage, and  Duration 
 
In Segment 1, a single dose of 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen will be administered to each subject. 
However, subjects who have documented individual PK profiles with the sponsor (e.g., due to particip ation in the previous Phase 1 study and received 6 mg/kg Plasminogen) do not need to 
undergo Segment 1 and can proceed directly to Segment 2. 
In Segment 2, repeated doses of 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen will be administered every second, third, 
or fourth day, depending on individual subject’s PK profile. Individual dosing intervals will be 
determined by [CONTACT_230672]’s plasminogen activity level remains 10% (absolute) above their baseline value. For example, if a subject’s plasminogen act ivity level 
remains above 10% (absolute %) above their baseline at 48 hours and their activity level at 72

3.5.2  Description of  Assessments 
 
Informed Consent/Assent  
Informed consent is a process that includes the signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) for 
all subjects. Assent will be required from subjects younger than 18 years with consent from their legally authorized representative according to state law. Patients should be approached according to site policies regarding confidentiality. Potential subjects should be informed about the study 
according to the requirements of International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP). The informed  consent process involves the investigator, and the subject should 
have the opportunity to discuss all aspects  of the study, ask questions, consider the ICF/assent  and 
statements, and provide an informed decision regarding any potential risks and any potential benefits. Both ICFs and assent, if applicable, must be signed prior to any study procedures being 
conducted. The informed consent/assent process continues throughout a subject’s participation in the study. Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study for any reason and at any time. A separate genetic testing consent will be required. 
Demographics  
Demographic information will be collected, including the subject’s date of birth, race, ethnicity, and sex. 
Medical History and Disease History and Symptoms  
A complete  medical  and surgical  history will be obtained. If the subject  is biologically  or surgic ally 
unable to reproduce offspring,  the reason  for sterility  should be recorded  as a diagnosis (males  and 
females).  
At least [ADDRESS_277738] 1 
year before screening, including any surgeries performed, other  treatments, and all symptoms of 
the disease (e.g., ligneous conjunctivitis). In addition, the investigator will interview the subject and record  any self-reported  lifetime  history and treatment  of the disease,  including the date when 
the disease was origi nally  diagnosed.

Protocol Number: 2002C011G  Prometic Biotherapeutics  Inc. 
Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous  
Version [ADDRESS_277739] 1 year before screening  will be recorded, 
including non-prescription, prescription, herbal/natural,  blood products, and birth  control for males 
and females who are able to reproduce at the time of screening. Records will include dates of use, 
indications, routes, doses, and schedules as appropriate. Corresponding diagnoses will also be 
recorded in the medical history with dates o f diagnoses. 
Plasminogen Genetic Test  
Optional plasminogen genetic testing will be conducted at screening for those subjects who provide written informed consent form for genetic testing. A blood sample will be obtained, 
centrifuged, transferred to, and frozen in a cryovial and stored at - 20°C. Genetic testing will be

is not necessary if the subject has undergone genetic testing in the past and the test result is 
available.  
PK Analyses for Plasminogen Activity and Antigen Levels  
Blood samples will be drawn and analyzed for plasminogen activity and plasminogen antigen 
levels at a Central Laboratory using validated assays. Plasminogen activity is assessed with a 
chromogenic assay developed and validated at a central specialty laboratory. Plasminogen 
antigen levels are determined by [CONTACT_6428] (Cell Sciences) and validated at a central specialty laboratory. 
For each sample taken for Plasminogen activity and antigen testing in Segments 1, 2, 
and 3 a backup sample will also be taken and stored at the Central Laboratory facility in case of 
repeat testing requirements. No backup sample is needed at the End of Study visit for subjects 
who decide to enter the treatment protocol.  
Segment 1  
Blood samples are drawn on Day - 4 before the IMP infusion to establish baseline levels for 
plasminogen activity, antigen, and D -dimer and at the following time points after the end of the 
infusion: between  5 and 15 minutes,  6 hours (± 30 minutes),  24 hours (± 2 hours, Day -3), 48 hours 
(± 2 hours, Day - 2), 72 hours (± 2 hours, Day - 1), and 96 hours (± 2 hours, Day 0). An individual 
PK profile will be developed based on these time points. 
Subjects who have had individual PK profile for 6 mg/kg Plasminogen with the  sponsor, due to 
participation in the prior Phase [ADDRESS_277740] dose of the IMP is given, to establish 
the baseline levels.

Confidential   
 For all subjects,  blood samples  will be drawn  every  2 weeks  before IMP infusion to measure trough 
levels through the final dose.  
A full PK profile will also be done for all subjects at the end of Segment 2 (Week 12 visit) to 
evaluate the stability of individual PK profile after [ADDRESS_277741]’s PK profile may be altered by [CONTACT_2671] 12- week treatment period. At the Week 12 visit, blood samples are drawn before the IMP 
infusion and at the following time points after the end of the infusion: between 5 and 15 minutes, 
6 hours (± 30 minutes), 24 hours (± 2 hours), 48 hours (± 2 hours), 72 hours (± 2 hours), and 96 
hours (± 2 hours). The PK profile  will be developed  for each subject  and compared  with his or her 
prior PK  profile(s).  
Furthermore, additional PK analyses may be performed at other time points during Segment [ADDRESS_277742]’s trough level or antibody test suggests the appearance of 
neutralizing antibody against the IMP or when the dosing frequency has changed. 
Segment 3  
Blood samples will be drawn at each study visit every 3 months before IMP infusion to measure 
trough levels. Plasminogen activity and antigen, D -dimer spot levels will be measured at the End 
of Study visit for subjects who decide to enter Treatment Protocol 2002C018G. 
PK Sample Handling:  
Blood samples  will be obtained, centrifuged, and resulting  plasma  will be transferred  to, and frozen 
in a cryovial and stored at - 20°C. All samples will be shipped frozen to a Central Laboratory for 
analysis. Details on processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_230637].  
Clinical Laboratory Tests  
 
Specimens for laboratory analysis will be obtained to ascertain if the subject meets eligibility criteria  and to assess for abnormal changes  and possible  AEs during the study. The laboratory tests 
include hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, fibrinolysis and coagulation panels, and urine pregnancy test (as applicable). See Appendix 15.[ADDRESS_277743] of specific tests to be conducted. 
Abnormal laborator y results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_093]. Clinically significant 
abnormalities or changes from baseline will be reported as AEs, according to the investigator’s 
judgment. However, changes that are associated with clinical improvement (for example, bl ood 
clot discharged in urine, increases in D- dimer) are not reported as AEs.

Virology  
Screening serology testing will be conducted for HIV -1, HIV -2, HCV, HBV, HAV, and B19 
(Appendix 15.2). Provided the subject  meets  all inclusion/Exclusion criteria,  the subject  may begin

 Measurement of Visible Lesions  
The size (length and width) of visible  lesions, such as ocular and gingival lesions, in subjects  who 
have ligneous conjunctivitis will be measured and documented using photography at each visit. 
The procedure of photographic measurements is described in the Study Manual. 
Imaging 
Nonvisible lesions (ureteral, oropharyngeal, and bronchial) may be qualitatively evaluated as 
appropriate via imaging  studies, such as computed tomography (CT) scans,  X-ray, or other suitable 
imaging techniques at the Investigator’s discretion. For example, if there is lung involvement 
suspected,  lesions may be monitored via a CT scan obtained at Screening  (unless already  available 
within the past 6 months) and at the Week [ADDRESS_277746] involvement of

Clinical Global Impression – Global Improvement (CGI -I) Scale  
The Clinical Global Impression -Global Improvement (CGI -I) Scale is a single, clinician - 
completed scale designed to capture the clinician’s impression of the subject’s disease improvement over time (Appendix 15.3). Clinicians are asked to consider their experience in this patient population and rate the change relative to the subject’s state at baseline using a 7-point scale (1 = very much improved, 7 = very much worse). 
Quality of life assessment  
Subjects are asked to rate their overall quality of life using a 10-point scale (0 = non-functioning, 
10 = normal; Appendix 15.4), adapted from a scale developed by [CONTACT_230684].

Any decision to voluntarily suspend or terminate a clinical trial will be carefully reviewed and fully justified. The  sponsor will notify the FDA and the IRB of any suspension or termination, 
along with justification for restarting or terminating the study as applicable. 
3.6.[ADDRESS_277749] who experiences any of the following occurrences will suspend the IMP tre atment 
until further assessments:  
• Anaphylactic response to study drug  administration  
• A significant AE that, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], necessitates suspension of treatment  
• Confirmed  presence of neutralizing  antibodies  (in at least 2 measurements)  in association  with

In all cases,  the reasons  for withdrawal  will be recorded  in the subject’s  source  documentation  and 
in the Case Report Form (eCRF). It is possible that some subjects may become lost to follow -up 
during the study. Every reasonable effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_230685]; all available 
efficacy and safety data co llected for these subjects will be used, even if incomplete. Subjects 
withdrawn from the study may be replaced so that there are at least 10 evaluable  subjects.  
Subjects  who do not meet  the entry  criteria at screening  will be ineligible  for treatment  and will be 
deemed screen failures. Subjects who are screen failed will not receive IMP; therefore, no PK or safety  data will be collected  for these subjects,  and only demographic  information  will be collected 
on the eCRF.  Subjects  who screen  fail will be considered  screened  but not enrolled.  A screen  failed 
subject may re- enter the study if they pass the re -screening. Only subjects who qualify for 
treatment will be  enrolled. 
3.7 Safety Monitoring  Committee  
 
The SMC is composed of the sponsor’s Medical Monitor and an independent Medical Monitor 
and will review the safety data (e.g., AE listings, laboratory data, vital sign data, trough levels) 
biweekly during Segments [ADDRESS_277750]  Identification

Version [ADDRESS_277754] medical occurrence (whether or not considered to have a causal 
relationship to IMP) in a study subject administered an IMP. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable  and uninte nded  sign (including clinically  significant  laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not related to the  IMP.  
However,  signs  and observations  that are associated  with clinical  improvement  (such  as discharge 
of blood clots in urine), as judged by [CONTACT_093], will not be reported as  AEs.  
5.1.2  Adverse Drug  Reaction  
 
All noxious and unintended responses to an IMP related to any dose should be considered ADRs. The phrase “responses to an IMP” means that  a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE 
is at least a reasonable possibility, that is, the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
5.1.[ADDRESS_277755] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in  death.  
• Is life -threatening (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred. 
This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or wa s allowed to 
continue, might have caused death).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study 
drug) or  
• Is a medically important event or  reaction:  
Events that did not result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_230647], based on appropriate medical 
judgment, jeopardize the subject or require intervention, to prevent one of the outcomes in the 
definition of SAE listed above, should also be considered SAEs.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_277756] be assessed according to the following categories:  
• Mild  – The AE/SAE  is easily  tolerated  by [CONTACT_423],  causes  minimal discomfort  and does not 
interfere with everyday activities; or  
• Moderate – The AE/SAE is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities; or

 • Severe – The AE/SAE prevents the subject from engaging in normal everyday activities.  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of a specific event. The event itself may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache). “Severe” is not the same as 
“serious”,  which  is defined on subject/event  outcome  or action  criteria usually  associated  with events 
that pose a threat to a subject/subject’s life or ability to carry out life functions. Seriousness is a 
medical term, while severity is a subjective term.  
5.1.5  Assessment of  Causality  
 
The following 4- point scale will be used by [CONTACT_230693]:  
• Definitely related: A clinical event (including laboratory test abnormality) occurring in a 
plausible  time relationship to IMP administration  and which  cannot  be explained  by [CONTACT_64716]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (de -challenge) 
should be clinically plausible. The event must be definitively associated pharmacologically, using a satisfactory re -challenge procedure, if necessary;  or 
• Probably related: A clinical event (including laboratory test abnormality) with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(de-challenge). Re- challenge information is not required to fulfill this definition; or 
• Possibly related: A clinical event (including laboratory test abnormality) with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_230694].  Information on drug withdrawal  may be lacking  or unclear; 
or 
• Not related: An event for which sufficient information exists to conclude that the etiology of 
the event is unrelated to the  IMP.  
The degree of certainty with which an AE or SAE is attributed to treatment with IMP (or alternative 
causes, e.g., natural history of underlying diseases, concomitant therapy) will be determined by [CONTACT_230695]:  
• Known pharmacology of the  IMP;  
• Reaction of similar nature being previously observed with this medication or class of 
medications; 
• The event having often been reported in literature for similar medications as related;  and/or  
• There is a temporal relationship between IMP administration and the  event.  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for all available relevant information about the IMP.

during the previous study period?” AEs will also be elicited through the use of Subject Diary 
cards,  which  the investigator  will review  in detail  with  the subject  at each  visit,  ensuring accuracy 
and completeness of entries recorded by [CONTACT_19578]. 
Any AE or ADR  occurring during the  study will be noted in detail  on the appropriate  pages  of the 
eCRF. If the patient reports several signs or symptoms, which represent a single syndrome or 
diagnosis, the latter  should be recorded  in the eCRF.  The investigator  will grade  the severity  of all 
AEs or ADRs  (mild,  moderate or severe),  the seriousness  (non- serious  or serious)  and relatedness, 
as defined in Section  5.1. 
In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be repeated and 
followed- up, as needed. Diseases, signs and symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities already 
existing  before  the first administration  of IMP are not considered  as AEs  when  observed  at a later 
stage unless they represent a worsening. 
The investigator  should always  provide  detailed  information  concerning  any abnormalities  and the 
nature  of, and reasons  for any necessary  action(s),  as well as any other  observations  or comments, 
which are useful for the interpretation and understanding of the subjects’ AEs or  ADRs.

must  be reported  beginning from  the time of first dose  of IMP  until [ADDRESS_277759]

information can be obtained after demonstration of due diligence with follow -up efforts (i.e., the 
subject or investigator is unable to provide additional information or, the subject is lost to follow - 
up).

sent via email to  [EMAIL_4510]. 
It should be noted that reporting to the PV CRO Safety Department within 24 hours of awareness 
is required for all SAEs regardless of their causal relationship with the IMP.  
The PV CRO Safety Depar tment, together with the sponsor’s medical monitor, will review all 
safety information/documentation and follow up with the investigative site to obtain any other 
required information. Follow -up information should be actively sought by [CONTACT_230696].  
The sponsor is responsible for reporting SAEs to IND/CTA under the oversight of the FDA and 
NMA (Norwegian Medicines Agency), respectively, as applicable.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_277761]/Ethics  Committee  
 
All AEs will be  reported  to the IRB/EC according  to the guidelines  of the IRB/EC.  However,  as a 
general guideline, IRBs/EC need to know about any AEs that are unexpected or of a greater severity  than what  is reported  in the IB. Reporting is always  required  for all SAEs.  Any new safety 
data (or other finding) that might affect an IRB/EC’s judgments regarding their risks versus 
benefits analysis should always be reported to the IRB/EC. The sponsor and the CRA will assist 
the investigator in determining which events require reporting and in what  timeframes.  
5.3.3  Expedited S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting (Sponsor  Responsibility)  
 
The sponsor will submit a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed FDA Form 3500A and/or 
CIOMS form) within 15 calendar days of receipt to the responsible review division of the FDA and 
the Norwegian Medicines Agency, as required, for any observed or volunteered SAE that  is: 
1) Suspected to be associated with the investigational drug or study treatment(s); and  
2) Unexpected.  
Any S[LOCATION_003]Rs that will be filed to the IND for the purpos e of notifying FDA, and will be filed 
electronically via EudraVigilance for the purpose of notifying the Norwegian Medicines Agency.  
In addition,  if the event  is fatal or life-threatening  and meets  the above  criteria,  a telephone  or facsimile 
notification will be sent to the FDA as soon as possible, but no later than 7 calendar days after the 
sponsor’s initial receipt, followed by a completed FDA Form 3500A within 15 calendar days after 
initial receipt.

 For each written IND Safety Report, the sponsor will identify all previously submitted IND Safety 
Reports that addressed a similar adverse event experience and will provide an analysis of the 
significance of the newly reported adverse event in light of the previous, similar report(s).  
If the results of the sponsor’s follow -up investigation show that an adverse event that was initially

accordance with Inclusion Criterion #6, and the techniques discussed at Screening should preferably not be changed during the course of the trial. A pregnancy test will be performed at 
Screening and at each study visit.  
In case a subject  becomes  pregnant  during the trial, she has to be withdrawn. Pregnancies  occurring 
during the study after exposure to the IMP need to be reported. The pregnancy notification form 
has to be sent to the CRO  Safety  Department.  Follow -up information  on the outcome  of both mother 
and fetus must also be reported. 
5.5 Procedure for Breaking the  Blind  
 
This is not a blinded study. 
5.6 Follow -up of Adverse  Events  
 
The responsible investigator will follow up each AE until it is resolved or until the medical condition of the patient has returned to baseline, and all relevant follow -up information has been 
reported to the sponsor.

the target  trough levels  for at least [ADDRESS_277766] an absolute 10% (10 U/dL) from the subject’s  individual  baseline level.  Baseline is defined  as the plasminogen activity  level  measured 
before the first dose of IMP at Segment 1, Day - 4 for su bjects who undergo Segment 1 or at 
Segment 2, Day 0 for those who do directly enter Segment  2. 
The secondary PK endpoints include individual PK profiles at the end of Segment 2, compared with their PK profiles at baseline, and trough plasminogen activity a nd antigen levels during 
Segment 2 and Segment 3. 
Plasminogen activity and antigen levels will be presented by [CONTACT_230697] (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation [SD], coefficient of variation [CV], 
medium, minimum, maximum, geometric mean and associated CV). In dividual and median 
profiles of the concentration- time data will be plotted using nominal times. Median profiles may 
be presented on both linear -linear and linear -log scales.  
Standard PK parameters, including area under the curve (AUC), clearance (CL), mean residence 
time (MRT), volume of distribution (V
d) and terminal half -life (t 1/2) will be calculated using non-  
compartmental analysis and baseline- adjusted plasminogen activity levels derived from Segment

achieving  at least a 50% improvement  in lesion  number/size  or functionality impact  from  baseline. 
Visible lesions are defined as lesions which can imaged and analyzed with digital photography. 
Other measureable lesions are defined as lesions whose dimensions can be assessed by [CONTACT_230698] (e.g. computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, etc) or 
functional assessments (e.g. spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], audiogram, oximetry, etc).  
Clinical success will be further described as a graded evaluation of potential clinical responses;  
1) Excellent response: > 75% decrease; 2) Good response : > 50% and < 75% reduction; 3) 
Moderate response: >  25% to < 50% reduction; 4) Minimal response: < 25% reduction; 5) No 
response: an increase or no reduction in the size of the lesion. Clinical responses will determined 
by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_8178] t he assessment of clinical success.  
All efficacy results will be presented descriptively by [CONTACT_66719], including summarized 
hypoplasminogenemia  symptoms  over time recorded  in subject  diaries.  The small sample  size and 
high variability of disease presentation do not allow formal statistical analyses.

Where possible a list of IRB/EC members should be obtained by [CONTACT_230710]. The investigator/sponsor will obtain prior approval for this clinical trial, its corresponding ICFs, and any material viewed by [CONTACT_423]. The IRB /EC will be provided with 
the following documents for review:  
• Clinical protocol and corresponding ICF(s);  
• Modifications (amendments) to the clinical protocol and corresponding ICFs;  
• Advertisements (i.e., directed at potential research subjects) for study recruitment, and any other 
material presented to a  subject.  
• Any other document they request for review  
• Clinical Investigational Drug  Brochure  
The IRB/EC must  operate  in compliance with FDA  regulations  21 CFR 50 and 21 CFR  56 and/or  EU 
Directives, and in conformance with applicable ICH E6 Guidelines on GCP. IRB/EC review 
documents should refer to the study be exact protocol title and number, and should identify the 
documents reviewed and the date of the review. The investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_230649]/EC updated regarding any new safety  data. 
10.[ADDRESS_277779] of the  Trial  
 
The clinical study will be conducted in accordance with the current IRB/EC -approved clinical 
protocol; ICH E6 Guidelines on GCP; and relevant policies, requirements, and regulations of the 
IRB/EC and applicable federal agencies. Any violations by [CONTACT_21127], CR O, or sponsor will also be 
submitted to IRBs and relevant regulatory agencies. 
The IRB/EC and the FDA/ Norwegian Competent Authority will be notified promptly of 
discontinuation of the entire clinical study. Respective protocol modifications will be submit ted 
prospectively to the IRB/EC and to the FDA/Norwegian  Competent  Authority  for discontinuation 
or modification  of parts  of the clinical  study. Enrolled subjects,  investigators,  and sub-investigators 
will be notified  immediately  of discontinuation of parts  of the clinical  study  or if the study ends or 
the discontinuation of a subject is  necessary.  
If there are changes  to the protocol  and a new informed  consent  has been  approved, subjects  should 
be informed of the changes and of any changes to the risks /benefits of participation. Subjects will 
need to go through the informed consent process and sign a new approved ICF to be eligible to continue on the  study.

effects are not completely known. This information must be provided in language that the subject 
understands. Each subject must be inform ed that participation in the study is voluntary and that 
they may withdraw from the study at any time, and that withdrawal of consent/assent will not affect their subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician. The subject should be given sufficient time to read the informed consent/assent form and the opportunity to 
ask questions and consider the statement before signing and dating it, and should be given a copy 
of the signed document(s). 
Informed consent will be obtained from eac h subject (or subject’s legally authorized 
representative) before the subject is admitted to the study. Assents will be obtained from each 
child. The assent will be presented to the child at an appropriate level of understanding for the 
particular  child. The assent  consists  of the same components  as the consent  and requires  discussion 
between the child and the parent or guardian and the investigator. The child will provide verbal assent and provide their signature [CONTACT_230722] (the parent or guardian may fill out 
the time and date,  if necessary).  No subject  can enter  the study before  informed  consent/assent  has 
been  obtained.  
The sponsor or its designee will supply a model informed consent/assent form that complies with 
regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for the study, as well as a model inform ed 
consent/assent form for optional genetic testing for plasminogen. Any changes to the sample consent  form  suggested  by [CONTACT_230711]/EC,  and a copy of  the approved version must  be provided to the sponsor  or 
the designated medical monitor after IRB/EC  approval. 
During the study, subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue participation. Should a protocol amendment be required, the consent/assent may be 
revised to reflect the changes of the protocol. If the consent/assent form is revised, it is the

10.[ADDRESS_277782] of the  Study  
 
The investigator may change the protocol without IRB/EC or sponsor approval only if it is necessary in order to safeguard the safety or rights of the subjects (i.e., in emergent situations). Any protocol amendment must be submitted for information or consideration to the applicable 
regulatory agencies.  
IRB approval will be requested for any change to this protocol, which could affect the safety of 
subjects,  the scope  or design of the study. Minor  procedural  changes  will be implemented  by [CONTACT_230714], with supporting documentation at each site, if appropriate. A non- substantial 
amendment of a study protocol includes minor correction or clarification that have no significant impact on the way the clinical study is to be conducted and no effect on subject safety (i.e., 
administrative  changes  like change  of telephone  number(s),  logistical changes,  etc.).  Any changes 
of the protocol (substantial amendments and non- substantial amendments) will be integrated into 
an updated study protocol, with a listing of all changes and reasoning for  them.  
11 Confidentiality  
The collection and processing of personal data from subjects enrolled in this study will be  limited 
to those data that are necessary to investigate the efficacy, safety, quality, and utility of the IMP 
used in this  study.  
The investigator will ensure that the subjects’ anonymity will be maintained. The privacy  rules  of 
the US HIPAA  will be followed  to obtain authorization for most  uses and disclosures  of Protected 
Health Information. On eCRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor or its designee, subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_1629] i dentification code, consisting of the 
combination of subject’s initials and study number. Documents not for submission to sponsor or its designee  (e.g., the site confidential  subject  enrollment  log and original  subjects’  consent  forms) 
will be maintained b y the investigator in strict confidence. Appropriate technical and 
organizational measures to protect the personal data against unauthorized disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, or alteration must be put in place. Sponsor personnel  whose  responsibilities  require  access  to personal  data agree to keep  the identity  of study 
subjects  confidential.  
The informed consent obtained from the subject includes explicit consent for the processing of personal data and for the investigator to allow direct access to his or her original medical records

WMA Declaration of Helsinki -  Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human 
Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 and amended by 
[CONTACT_941]: 29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_277784] WMA General Assem bly, Washington DC, [LOCATION_003], October 2002 (Note of Clarification added) 55th WMA 
General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 2004 (Note of Clarification added) 59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008 64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013 
Preamble 
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and  data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The WM A encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human 
subjects to adopt these  principles. 
General Principles  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the  words, 
“The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical 
Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when provi ding medical 
care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote  and safeguard  the health, well-being and rights  of 
patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and 
conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of t his duty. 
5. Medical  progress  is based  on research  that ultimately  must  include  studies  involving human 
subjects.  
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic 
interventions  (methods, procedures  and treatments).  Even  the best proven interventions  must  be

Version [ADDRESS_277786], incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating 
subjects who are harmed as a consequen ce of participation in the research study. 
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial 
provisions. 
Research Ethics Committees  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval  to the concerned research  ethics  committee  before  the study begins. This committee  must 
be transparent  in its functioning, must  be independent  of the researcher,  the sponsor  and any other 
undue  influence  and must  be duly qualified. It must  take into consideration the laws and regulations 
of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the 
protections for researc h subjects set forth in this  Declaration.

Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous  
Version [ADDRESS_277787] submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. 
Privacy and Confidentiality 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privac y of research subjects and the 
confidentiality of their personal  information.  
Informed Consent  
25. Participation by [CONTACT_54126]. Although it may be appropriate to consult fami ly members or 
community  leaders,  no individual  capable of giving informed  consent  may be enrolled  in a research 
study unless he or she freely agrees.  
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each 
potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any 
possible  conflicts  of interest,  institutional affiliations  of the researcher,  the anticipated  benefits  and 
potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post -study provisions and any other 
relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to w ithdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special 
attention  should be  given to the specific  information  needs  of individual  potential  subjects  as well 
as to the methods used to deliver the  information. 
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or 
another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely- given 
informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expr essed in writing, the non-  
written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the 
general outcome and results of the study. 
27. When  seeking  informed  consent  for participation  in a research  study the physician  must  be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or 
may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by [CONTACT_183400]. 
28. For a potential  research  subject  who is incapable of giving informed  consent,  the physician 
must  seek informed  consent  from  the legally  authorized  representative.  These individuals  must  not 
be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead 
be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only 
minimal risk and minimal burden.

should be  respected.  
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for exa mple, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that 
prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized 
representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the 
study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent  to 
remain  in the research  must  be obtained  as soon  as possible  from  the subject  or a legally  authorized 
representative.  
30. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw 
from the study must never adversely affect the patient - physician relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on 
material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed 
consent  for its collection,  stora ge and/or  reuse.  There may be exceptional  situations  where consent 
would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics  committee.  
Use of Pl acebo  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against 
those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable;  
or 
Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any  
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention  
and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, 
placebo,  or no intervention  will not be subject  to additional  risks  of serious  or irreversible  harm  as 
a result of not receiving the best proven intervention. 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
Post-Trial Provisions  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should 
make provisions  for post-trial access  for all participants  who still need  an intervention identified

informed consent from the patient or a legally authori zed representative, may use an unproven 
intervention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or 
alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, 
where appropriate, made publicly available.

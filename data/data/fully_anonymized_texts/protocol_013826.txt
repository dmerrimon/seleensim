3.0 DISEASE BACKGROUND  
3.1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal malignancy of worldwide significance 
and has become increasingly important in  the [LOCATION_002]. Overall, it is the most common 
Protocol 2017-[ADDRESS_232144] common cause of cancer-
related deaths worldwide [1]. Various risk factors ar e responsible for the majority  of HCC cases.  
these include liver cirrhosis  (multiple etiologies), hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) infection, alcohol abuse, and non- alcoholic fatty liver disease  [2]. Notably, although 
treatment for HCV has dramatically improved over the past several years, HCC incidence in the 
[LOCATION_002] is rising especially among patients chronically infected with HCV. This is likely due 
to the long latency period between initial HCV infection and HCC incidence [3, 4].  
Treatment options for HCC depend on the cancer stage at initial presentation  and degree 
of synthetic liver dysfunction. Although a number of different staging systems have been used to provide accurate prognostic assessment  (i.e. AJCC, Okuda, GRETCH, CLIP, etc.) , all have 
limitations. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system provides an easy reference 
algorithm that links HCC stage and evidence- based treatment recomm endations (Fig. 1) [5 -7].

     6 The only potentially curative treatment modalities for HCC include surgical resection 
(partial hepatectomy) and liver transplantation. Unfortunately, the actual number of patients who 
qualify for these modalities is small (approximately 10 -30%) because most patients present with 
locally advanced or metastatic disease, or have significant liver dysfunction that precludes curative 
options. Surgical resection is typi[INVESTIGATOR_195642] w ith a solitary tumor of any size 
who have adequate liver remnant and no evidence of major vascular invasion or portal 
hypertension [8]. Recent evidence has shown that partial hepatectomy procedures in carefully 
selected patients can be done with low operative morbidity and mortality [9, 10] . However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_195643], in those patients who are fortunate to undergo surgical 
resection, tumor recurrence is common. In fact, the 5- year tumor recurrence rate following surgical 
resection have been reported to be as high as 70%  [11-13].  
 Although there is no FDA -approved medication for use in the adjuvant setting after surgical 
resection, the recently reported phase III STORM trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of sorafenib, an antiangiogenic agent approved for use in advanced HCC  [14]. In this study, 1,[ADDRESS_232146] to recurrence- free survival  (RFS), time to recurrence (TTR) or overall 
survival (OS) . At this time, there remains no evidence to support a particular adjuvant therapy in 
HCC.  Of note, our pi[INVESTIGATOR_195644].  
 Liver transplantation is the other potentially curative treatment option for HCC p atients 
that removes both the underlying HCC tumors and ba ckground cirrhosis. In 1996, Mazzaferro and 
colleagues  proposed the Milan criteria (single lesion ≤  5 cm or 2 -3 lesions each ≤  3 cm, no 
macrovascular invasion, no extrahepatic disease) for patients with small, unresectable HCC in the setting of cirrhosis [15] . For patients meeting this criterion who underwent orthotropic liver 
transplantation, the OS and RFS rates at 4 years were 85% and 92%, respectively. Subsequent 
studies have confirmed the results reported i n this initial Mazzaferro study. B ecause of this, the 
United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) has adopted the Milan criteria for determining candidates for liver transplantation with HCC. Moreover, in 2001, Yao and colleagues proposed 
expanded criteria  (UCSF Criteria) for HCC liver transplantation (single lesion ≤  6.5 cm or 2 -3 
lesions, each ≤  4.5 cm + sum of lesions ≤  8 cm, no macrovascular invasion, no extrahepatic 
disease) t hat demonstrated 1-  and 5- year survival rates of 90% and 75%,  respectively [16]. Because 
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     7 UNOS specifies that patients undergoing evaluation for liver transplantation are not eligible for 
partial hepatectomy, liver transplantation is usually reserved for those patients with early -stage 
HCC and moderate to severe cirrhosis (i.e., Child’s Pugh B or C). On the other hand, partial hepatectomy is considered for those patients with mild cirrhosis (i.e., Child’s Pugh A) having an 
HCC tumor amenable to resection as deemed by [CONTACT_134733].  
 Local -regional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195645], local -regional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195646] -only disease but who are not resection or 
transplantation candidates . Even though there is no absolute HCC size -cut off for use of the se 
treatment modalities, there are a number of contraindications to use. These include poor synthetic liver function (i.e. Child Pugh C), elevated bilirubin > 2.5, significant ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, recent variceal bleeding, and main portal vein thrombosis. Local -regional 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195647]: ablation and arterially directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 Ablative modalities include thermal ablation (radiofrequency ablation or microwave 
ablation), cryoablation, or chemical ablation ( percutaneous ethanol infusion or acetic acid 
injection).  Ablative procedures may be curative in treating tumors ≤  [ADDRESS_232147] diameter  [17-19] . Radiofrequency ablation 
(RFA), which we consider the most commonly used method of the ablative options, involves the 
local application of radiofrequency thermal energy to small  HCC lesions. In fact, some centers 
even consider  RFA the treatment of choice for small tumors (<2 cm) in an appropriate location. 
This is based on studies demonstrating similar outcomes for these tumors when compared to 
surgical resection with less cost and procedure -related complications [20] .  
 Arterial directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195648] -based infusion of particular 
substances into the hepatic artery . These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195649] a dual blood 
supply; the portal vein supplies blood to normal liver parenchyma whereas the hepatic artery supplies blood to HCC lesions. Such modalities are particularly attractive because all tumors, 
irrespective of location, can be treated with an arterial approach provided the blood supply to the tumor can be manipulated without causing undo harm to surrounding, normal tissue. In general, arterial based treatments are used for larger tumors not amenable to resection, transplantation or 
an ablative approach.  Currently available arterial directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195650], transarterial chemoembolization, transarterial ra dioembolization and yttrium -90 
microspheres.  
 External -beam Radiation  Therapy (EBRT)  
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     8  Because HCC is a radiosensitive tumor, EBRT can be employed in patients with 
unresectable or inoperable HCC to deliver high doses of radiation to the underlying HCC tumors 
while sparing the normal liver parenchyma. Like arterial based approaches, EBRT can be used to 
treat all tumor regardless of location . Specific  EBRT  modalities include intensity -modulat ed 
radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic  body radiation therapy (SBRT), and proton beam therapy 
(PBT). Notably, SBRT is usually considered in patients with liver -only disease who have failed 
ablative or arterial -based approaches, and for those with partial vein thrombosis [21] .  
  
Sorafenib for advanced HCC  
 Sorafenib is an orally bioavailable agent originally developed as a Raf kinase inhibitor. 
Further studies revealed that sorafenib was also a potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR -1, -2, and - 3), as well as platelet derived growth factor receptor 
(PDGFR), KIT and FLT3. Currently, sorafenib is the only FDA -approved therapy for advanced or 
unresectable HCC . This approval was based on the phase III SHARP study, which evaluated 602 
patients with advanced HCC who had not received previous systemic therapy who received either 
sorafenib (400 mg BID) or placebo [22] . Media n overall survival was 10.7 months in the sorafenib 
group compared to 7.9 months in the placebo group; there was also a benefit in time to 
symptomatic progression (5.5 months for sorafenib vs. 2.8 months for placebo). Additionally, in 
the phase III Asia -Pacific study , 226 patients with advanced HCC were randomized to receive 
either sorafenib (400 mg BID) or placebo [23] . This study, which included a large number of HBV 
infected patients, also demonstrated improved OS (6.5 months vs. 4.2 months) and TT P (2.8 
months for 1.4 months) for the sorafenib group.   
 Of note, there currently is no second line therapy approved for advanced HCC.  
Regorafenib for advanced HCC  
 Regorafenib is an orally bioavailable agent that inhibits multiple membrane -bound and 
intracellular kinases involved in cell growth (RET, VEGFR -1, VEGFR -2, VEGFR -3, KIT, 
PDGFR -alpha, PDGFR -beta, FGFR1, FGFR2, TIE2, DDR2, Trk2A, Eph2A, RAF -1, BRAF, 
SAPK2, PTK5 and ABI). Although regorafenib is not ye t approved for advanced HCC, the 
recently reported phase III RESORCE Trial evaluated 573 patients with intermediate or advanced 
stage HCC who had been previously treated with sorafenib (data unpublished) . Patient s were 
randomized 2:1 to receive either rego rafenib 160 mg daily or placebo for 1- 3 of each four -week 
cycle. This trial, which has not been formally published, demonstrated improvements in both

     9 median OS (10.6 months vs. 7.8 months) and PFS (3.1 months vs. 1.5 months) for the regorafenib 
group.  
Other systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195651]; however, no single regimen has shown superiority to any other. Most 
randomized trials have demonstrated median OS benefits of < [ADDRESS_232148] been tested in HCC include doxorubicin, epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], mitoxantrone, 5- fluorouracil (5-
FU), capecitabine, gemcitabine, irinotecan, thalidomide, cisplatin, bevacizumab (VEGF inhibitor) 
and ramicirumab (V EGF inhibitor). In addition, a number of combination chemotherapy regimens 
have also been tested with limited clinical efficacy. These include FOLFOX (infusional 5-
fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin), cisplatin doublets, gemcitabine doublets and PI[INVESTIGATOR_195652] (c isplatin, 
interferon alpha, doxorubicin, and infusional 5- FU). Notably, our group recently performed a 
clinical trial which tested the efficacy of modified PI[INVESTIGATOR_195653]  [24]. Our results demonstr ated an ORR=36% and a rate of 
conversion to curative surgery = 33%.  
3.3 Anti -PD1 (Nivolumab)  
3.3.1 Mechanism of Action  
Immune activation is tightly regulated by [CONTACT_3252]- stimulatory (e.g. CD28 and ICOS) and co-
inhibitory (e.g. CTLA -4 and PD -1) receptors expressed on T cells. Agonistic antibodies against 
co-stimulatory T cell receptors and blocking antibodies against co- inhibitory T cell surface 
receptors have both been shown to potentiate T cell activation for tumor cell killing.  
PD-1 (programme d death receptor -1) is mainly expressed by [CONTACT_195713]4+ and CD8+ T 
cells, as well as APCs. It has two ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2, with distinct expression profiles [25] . 
PD-L1 is expressed not only on APCs, but also on non- hematopoietic cells, including tumor cells. 
Expression of PD -L2 is larg ely restricted to APCs including macrophages and myeloid dendritic 
cells, as well as mast cells.  The role of PD -[ADDRESS_232149] 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_195714] -1 deficient mice developed significant autoimmunity with 
high titers of autoantibodies [26, 27] . Subsequently, blocking antibodies against PD -1 were shown 
to activate immune responses that resulted in reduction of tumor metastasis and tumor growth in a 
number of experimental tumor models [28, 29] . Consistent with the immune inhibitory role of PD -
1/PD -L1/[ADDRESS_232150] of PD -L1 
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     10 on tumor growth was reversed by [CONTACT_195715] -PD-L1 antibodies [30] . Patients with high tumor 
and/or lymphocyte PD -L1 levels are 4.5 times more likely to die from their cancer than those with 
low levels of PD -L1 expression.  
Notably, the PD -1 pathw ay regulates  T cell response s in chronic inflammatory liver 
conditions ( HBV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis , and NAFLD ) that are responsible for the large 
majority of HCC. Interestingly, in a previous study examining the PD -[ADDRESS_232151] significantly increased numbers of 
PD-1 expressi ng lymphocytes [31] . Subsequent reports have confirmed that  there is up -regulation 
of PD -1 in patients infected with HBV or HCV [32, 33] .  
Nivolumab (BMS -936558) is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype, monoclonal antibody 
that bi nds PD -1. Blockade of the PD -[ADDRESS_232152] by [CONTACT_195716] (MLR). PD -[ADDRESS_232153] of nivolumab on antigen- specific recall 
response was investigated using a CMV -restimulation assay with human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and was evaluated by [CONTACT_6428]. These data indicated that nivolumab, versus an isotype -matched control antibody, augmented IFN -γ secretion f rom CMV -specific 
memory T cells in a dose -dependent manner. PD -1 blockade by [CONTACT_195717] 
a promising immunotherapeutic strategy.  
3.3.2 Nivolumab in Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
 El-Khoueiry AB , et al. presented results from the interim analysis of the phase 1/2 
nivolumab trial (CA209- 040) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma  at the 2015 
annual ASCO meeting [34]. In the  presentation, the  dose escalation  study demonstrated safety and 
tolerability of nivolumab at 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg in patients with HCC due to HCV, HBV or who were uninfected with viral hepatitis. The only grade 4 adverse event was elevated lipase (1 patient) while grade 3 elevations in liver enzymes were se en in 9 patients (AST = 5, ALT = 9). 3 
mg/kg was selected for the dose expansion in the uninfected and HCV cohorts; the dose escalation 
for the HBV cohort was ongoing. In [ADDRESS_232154] 1.1 
criteria was 19%  (8) with 2 patients achieving a complete response. The preliminary overall 
survival at 12 months was 62% (95% CI 42- 76%). Moreover, Sangro B, et al . recently presented 
interim results of 214 patients in the expansion CheckMate -040 study who received Nivolumab 3 
mg/kg every 2 weeks [35]. This report demonstrated a preliminary ORR = 16%.  
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     11  Because of these results, a phase III study comparing nivolumab to sorafenib for patients 
with advanced HCC has been launched in the frontline setting with an estimated enrollment of 726 
patients and primary completion date of July 2017 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
3.3.3 Summary of Results from Nivolumab Program  
For a complete review of clinical information, please refer to the nivolumab Investigator 
Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of Safety  
In clinical trial CA209001 (n = 39), patients received a single dose of nivolumab with 
possible retreatment at [ADDRESS_232155] frequent adverse events (AEs) were fatigue (56%), 
nausea (44%), proteinuria (38%), constipation (33%), b ack pain (33%), dry mouth (28%), 
vomiting (28%), rash (26%) and dyspnea (26%). There was no clear correlation between the 
incidence or severity of AEs and the nivolumab dose levels (0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg IV single dose, 
with possible retreatment at 3 months). Among 39 (100%) patients who had at least one AE, 32 (82%) had Grade 3 or 4 AEs. Three treatment -related severe adverse events (SAEs) were reported: 
hypothyroidism (Grade 2), colitis (Grade 3), and anemia (Grade 2). Among 12 deaths, none were 
consider ed drug- related.  
In CA209003 (n = 306), as of the database lock date of 18- March -2013, nivolumab- related 
AEs of any grade occurred in 75.2% of patients [36] . The most fre quent drug- related AEs 
occurring in ≥ 5% of patients included fatigue (28.1%), rash (14.7%), diarrhea (13.4%), pruritus 
(10.5%), nausea (9%), decreased appetite (9%), and fever (6%). The majority of AEs were low 
grade, with Grade 3/4 drug- related AEs obser ved in 14% of patients. The most common Grade 
3/4 drug- related AEs occurring in ≥ 1% of patients were fatigue (2%), pneumonitis (1%), diarrhea 
(1%), AST/ALT increase (0.3% each) Drug -related SAEs occurred in 17% of patients. Grade 3/4 
drug- related SAEs occurring in ≥ 1% of patients were: pneumonitis (1.3%), and diarrhea (1%). 
The spectrum, frequency, and severity of nivolumab- related AEs were generally similar across 
dose levels and histological subtypes. Other drug- related AEs included vitiligo, hepatitis,  
hypophysitis, and thyroiditis.  
Hepatic or gastrointestinal events were managed with treatment interruption and 
administration of corticosteroids, and were generally completely reversible. Endocrine events were managed with hormone replacement therapy. Se veral patients in these categories successfully 
reinitiated treatment with nivolumab. Drug -related pneumonitis occurred in 3% of patients; Grade 
≥ 3 pneumonitis developed in 3 patients (1%). No clear relationship was identified between the 
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     12 occurrence of pn eumonitis and tumor type, dose level, or the number of doses received. Low -grade 
pneumonitis was generally reversible with treatment discontinuation and corticosteroid 
administration. In three patients, infliximab and/or mycophenolate were utilized for additional 
immunosuppression, with unclear effectiveness. There were three (1%) drug- related deaths due to 
pneumonitis. In two of these cases, the patients did not receive the early and aggressive 
intervention (including systemic corticosteroid therapy) that is likely key in the management of 
this toxicity, while in the third case, other anti- cancer agents (erlotinib and vinorelbine) may have 
contributed to the fatal event. 
Additional details on the safety profile of nivolumab, including results from other cli nical 
studies, are also available in the Investigator Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of Clinical Activity  
In CA209001 and CA209003, the clinical activity of nivolumab was demonstrated in a 
variety of tumor types, including melanoma, RCC, non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Clinical activity was noted across a range of doses (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg) and across dosing schedules (every 2 weeks dosing for CA209003, single administration with possibility of retreatment at 3 months in CA209001). 
In CA209001, all treated patients (n = 39) were evaluable for tumor response [37] . Partial 
response (PR) was reported in 3 patients and stable disease (SD) was reported in 10 patients. Patients with PRs included 1 patient with CRC treated at 3 mg/kg and 1 patient each with 
melanoma and RCC, both treated at 10 mg/kg. Tumor responses were maintained in these patients 
as of their last radiological tumor assessments at 26, 3, and 18 months, respectively as of the 
clinical data cut -off date. The patient with RCC had received multiple prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including 
sunitinib and sorafenib. In 2 of the 10 patients with SD, stable disease was maintained for more 
than 6 months. 
In CA209003, as of the  database lock date of  18-March -2013, a total of 306 patients with 
melanoma, RCC, and NSCLC were evaluated for clinical activity [36] . A response of either CR 
or PR, as determined by [CONTACT_195718] 1.0, has been reported at all 
dose levels. No responses (CR or PR) have been reported in patients with colorectal carcinoma or 
castrate -resistant prostate cancer.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Pharmacology Summar y 
Single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was evaluated in patients with multiple 
tumor types in CA209001 whereas multiple dose PK is being evaluated in patients in CA209003. 
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     13 In addition, a preliminary population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model has been developed with data 
from ~350 patients from CA209001, CA209002, and CA209003. 
Single dose PK of nivolumab was evaluated in 39 patients with multiple tumor types in 
study MD1106- 01 in the dose range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. The median Tmax across single doses 
ranged from 1.6 to 3 hours with individual values ranging from 0.9 to 7 hours. The PK of 
nivolumab is linear in the range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg with dose - proportional increase in Cmax and 
AUC (INF) with low to moderate inter -subject variability observed at ea ch dose level (i.e., CV 
ranging from 7 to 45%). Geometric mean clearance (CL) after a single intravenous (IV) dose 
ranged from 0.13 to 0.19 mL/h/kg, while mean volume of distribution (Vz) varied between 83 to 
113 mL/kg across doses. The mean terminal T -HAL F of nivolumab is [ADDRESS_232156] modeling using data 
from 350 patients from CA209001, CA209002, and CA209003. The body weight normalized 
dosing produces approximately constant trough concentrations over a wide range of body weights, 
and hence is appropriate for future clinical trials of nivolumab. 
3.4 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Yervoy): Background  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (anti- CTLA -4) is a fully humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody to cytotoxic 
T-cell lymphoma -4 (CTLA -4). Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195654] (as compared to peptide vaccine 
gp100) and in combination with dacarbazine (as compared to dac arbazine alone) [38, 39] . It has 
been studied in combination with multiple standard- of-care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195655]- squamous NSCLC and radiotherapy for hormone resistant prostate cancer [40] .

[38], the following AEs were observed in at least 10% of subjects: fatigue (42%), diarrhea (33%), 
nausea (35%), decreased appetite (27%), vomiting (24%), pruritus (24%), constipation (21%), rash (19%), cough (16%), abdominal pain (15%), headache (15%) and pyre xia (12%). Additional irAEs 
occurring in < 10% of subjects but with clinical relevance included: colitis (8%); endocrinopathies

elevations in AST/ALT; and vitiligo (2%). Other reported irAEs include nephritis, pneumonitis, 
meningitis, pericarditis, uveitis, iritis and hemolytic anemia. Overall irAEs occurred in 
approximately 60% of subjects, of which 13% were Grade 3- 4, and 0.8% were Grade 5 [38, 40] .  
Seven death s were associated with an irAE -  GI perforation (4), colitis (1), liver failure (1), and 
Guillain -Barré Syndrome (1). In addition, [ADDRESS_232157] in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195657]100 group of 
MDX010 -20 clinical trial had a Grade 4 skin irAE (Stevens Johnson syndrome/toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_7387]/Lyell’s syndrome), but died due to a treatment -related acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086]. The irAEs are related to T -cell activation and can be serious or life threatening. Specific

 Interestingly, anti -CLTA -4 therapy ( tremelimumab)  was previously teste d in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_195660], preliminary antitumor/antiviral effect of tremelimumab in patients with HCC and chronic HCV [42] . In the 21 patients enrolled in this study, 20 were evaluable for toxicity 
and 17 for tumor response. Tremelimumab had an acceptable safety profile with only 1 patient

CTLA -4 and anti -PD1 as well as supportive preclinical data, a phase I study was conducted on 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195661]  [43]. In this 
trial, patients were treated with intravenous doses of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195662] 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by [CONTACT_195720] 3 weeks for 4 doses (concurrent regimen). 
The combined treatment was subsequently administered every 12 weeks for up to 8 doses. In a sequenced regimen, patients previously treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195663] 2 weeks for up to 48 dos es.  
A total of 53 patients received concurrent therapy with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and 33 
received sequenced treatment. The ORR  (according to modified WHO criteria) for all patients in 
the concurrent -regimen group was 40%. Evidence of clinical activity (conventional, unconfirmed, 
or immune -related response or stable disease for ≥24 weeks) was observed in 65% of patients. At

a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] a dose of 3 mg per kilogram), 53% 
of patients had an objective response, all with tumor reduction of 80% or more  
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to therapy occurred in 53% of patients in the 
concurrent -regimen group but were qualitatively similar to previous experience with monotherapy 
and were generally reversible. Among patients in the sequenced- regimen group, 18% had grade 3 
or 4 adverse events related to therapy and the objective -response rate was 20%.  
A follow -up phase 3 s tudy examined 945 previously untreated patients with advanced 
melanoma [44]. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of three regimens: 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus placebo; nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by [CONTACT_20382] 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks; or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses plus placebo. The investigator -assessed ORR for 
the 3 treatment regimens were 43.7% (95% CI, 38.1 to 49.3) in the nivolumab alone gr oup, 57.6% 
(95% CI, 52.0 to 63.0) in the combination nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315], and 19% (95% CI, 14.9 to 23.8) in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195664]. The median progression- free survival was 6.9 months 
(95% CI, 4.3 to 9.5), 11.5 months (95% CI, 8.9 to 16.7), and 2.9 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 3.4), 
respectively. In addition, grade 3- 4 treatment -related adverse events occurred in 16.3% in the 
nivolumab group, 55% in the nivolumab- ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315], and 27.3% in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315], 
with diarrhea and fatigue being the most common adverse events.

arterial -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or EBRT) can pal liate and sometimes downstage non- resectable lesions, 
but are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_195667]. Sorafenib is the only FDA -approved systemic therapy 
for advanced HCC. Therefore, patients with unresectable HCC have  poor survival and there is a 
high recurrence rate (~50% or more) for those receiving potentially curative therapy. Novel 
treatment approaches taking advantage of the higher response rates seen in early- phase  HCC 
studies and long- term survival of immunothe rapi[INVESTIGATOR_195668].  As a basis for future research in H CC, immunological pathways in response 
to monotherapy versus combinational therapy need to be evaluated in the context of clinical outcome in or der to identify predictive and prognostic biomarkers as well as other potential 
therapeutic targets.  
Anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, has recently been shown in a phase  1-2 clinical trial on 42  
patients with advanced or unresectable HCC to result in 19% ORR ; many of these responses were 
durable with a response duration of 1- 8+ months in patients achieving a PR [ 34]. Subsequent 
analysis of 214 patients on this study confirmed a 16% ORR. Of note, these response rates compare favorably to those  seen for sorafenib  where the ORR = 2%  (without any observable CRs).  Anti-

preoperative setting in renal cell carcinoma at MD Anderson.  
  Based  upon the above functional mechanisms and clinical activities of nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], we propose to use nivolumab alone, or nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195669] a number of reasons. First, it will offer patients with resectable HCC th e promising 
clinical benefits of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] . This may result in improved recurrence rates for 
those patients receiving curative surgery. Second, it will allow us to further evaluate potentially 
synergistic or additive activities on HCC  between nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] . Third, this proposed 
trial will allow us to evaluate the immunological pathways  in HCC tissues after treatment with 
nivolumab alone, or with nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], to interrogate potential predictive/prognostic 
biomarkers of clinical response.  
We hypothesize that therapy with nivolumab alone, or combination therapy with 
nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195670], with identification of novel biomarkers that can be used for correlation 
of clinical outcomes in patients with  resectable HCC .

5.1  Registration  
This is  a randomized  preoperative pi[INVESTIGATOR_195672] . Patients will be registered by [CONTACT_195722].  
5.2 Data Collection  
Data will be collected and stored in an approved database as required.  
5.3  Study Design and Duration  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], randomized, open- label study of preoperative nivolumab alone (Arm A) or 
nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Arm B) in patients with resectable H CC. A total of 30 patients will 
be enrolled  as follows:  Arm A (15 patients) and Arm B ( 15 patients ). Patients will be 
randomized into either Arm A or B. 
Note: As of January 8, 2020, [ADDRESS_232173] arm (Arm C) in which 15 unresectable patients were 
to receive nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks for 3 doses plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg IV on day 1 
of therapy (3 doses of nivolumab, 1 dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]; 6 weeks) followed by [CONTACT_447] -treatment 
biopsy. The study objective in Arm C was to estimate the conversion rate to surgery for potentially 
resectable patients. However, the study has been amended in June 2019 to remove exclude this 
objective and enrollment of Arm C (Appendix II).    
Patients in Arm A (resectable cohort)  will receive nivolumab at 240 mg IV every 2 weeks 
for 3 doses followed by [CONTACT_195723] 1 of week 7, followed (after 4 
weeks from surgery) by [CONTACT_20382] 480 mg IV every  4 weeks in the adjuvant setting until disease 
progression or for 2 years , whichever is sooner. Patients in Arm B (resectable cohort)  will receive 
nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks for 3 doses plus  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg IV on day 1 of therapy 
(3 doses of nivolumab, 1 dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) followed by [CONTACT_195724] (after 4 
weeks from surgery) by [CONTACT_20382]  480 mg IV every  4 weeks plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg IV every 
6 weeks to 4 doses in the adj uvant setting. Adjuvant therapy will start after 4 weeks from surgery 
with nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks (Both Arms A and B) plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg IV 
every 6 weeks (in Arm B only) for up to [ADDRESS_232174] cycle, whichever is sooner. For Arm B, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195673]- known. Since 
the doses of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195674], no dose increases or reductions will be allowed. 
Patients will return at week 6  for a pre -surgical evaluation. A small portion of patients with 
rapid diseas e progression (We anticipate 1 -3 of a total of 30 patients  in Arms A and B ) may not 
have hepatic resection per discretion of the treating surgical and medical oncologists. These 
patients will be off protocol and treated with other standard or investigational agents. They will be asked to return for an optional biopsy that will be scheduled in place of their surgery. For patients who had significant progression of disease pre -operat ively but are still eligible for  hepatic resection 
or transplantation, they will be treated with other investigational agents vs. observation post -
operatively  as there is  no standard adjuvant therapy in surgically resected HCC.  
Protocol 2017- [ADDRESS_232175] tre atment, hepatic resection or biopsy will occur on day 1 of week 
7 (+/- 7 days). We will obtain surveillance scans (MRI of abd omen and pelvis with/without 
contrast, and CT chest with/without contrast of chest) [ADDRESS_232176] -operatively will be taken off study and an optional biopsy 
will be taken at that time for immunological analysis.  
Patients who complete the study or discontinue study treatment should be scheduled for an 
end of treatment visit (EOT) as soon as possible. All patients who complete the study or 
discontinue treatment will have a safety follow -up visit 30 (+/ - 14 days) after the last dose of study 
drug or surgery, whichever comes last. Please refer to Figure [ADDRESS_232177] or MRI and be assessed for treatment 
response by [CONTACT_15213] : MRI or CT of abd omen and pelvis with/without contrast, and CT chest 
with/without contrast of chest (according to RE CIST 1.1 and irRC ) at week 6  (+/- 7 days). E ach 
patient will have post -surgical  (day 1 of week 11 +/- 7 days) , staging studies as above . 
Subsequently, restaging will be carried out every 12 weeks unless, in the investigators’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], follow -up intervals need to be shorter. Studies to confirm a complete response or document 
progressive disease will be performed as needed. Patients will be allowed to continue study therapy after initial investigator -assessed RECIST 1.1 /irRC -defined progression if they are de emed by [CONTACT_195725](s), as described in Section 8.3.

6.0 STUDY MEDICATIONS  
6.1 Nivolumab (Anti -PD1, nivolumab) 
The vials are not subject specific although there will be specific vial assignments by [CONTACT_195726]-supply.  
6.1.1 Dose Calculation of nivolumab 
Nivolumab will be dosed at the the currently FDA -approved dose of 240 mg/dose every 
two weeks  or 480 mg/dose every 4 weeks. The flat dose was recently deemed similar to the 3mg/kg 
dosing that was previously used. Dose adjustment is not allowed. 
Figure 2 . Study Design of preoperative nivolumab alone or in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. There are 2 arms to this study: A) Nivolumab monotherapy in resectable HCC; 
B) Combination nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195675].  
Protocol 2017- [ADDRESS_232178] storage manager should ensure that the study drug is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by [CONTACT_195727]. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study drug arise, do not dispense 
the study drug and contact [CONTACT_8650].  
Investigational product documentation must be maintained that includes all processes 
required to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes documentation of drug storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconstitution, and use of required processes (e.g. required diluents, administration sets). 
Nivolumab vials must be stored at a temperature of 2°C to 8°C and should be protected 
from light. If stored in a glass front refrigerator, vials should be stored in the carton. Recommended safety measures for preparation and handling of nivolumab include laboratory coats and gloves.  
For details on prepared drug storage and use tim e of nivolumab under room 
temperature/light and refrigeration, please refer to the Investigator Brochure section for 
“Recommended Storage and Use Conditions”.  Care must be taken to assure sterility of the 
prepared solution as the product does not contain any anti -microbial preservative or bacteriostatic 
agent. No incompatibilities between nivolumab and polyolefin bags have been observed.  
Nivolum ab is to be administered as a 30  +/- 15-minute  IV infusion, using a volumetric 
pump with a 0.2/0.22 micron in- line filter at the protocol- specified dose. The drug can be diluted 
with 0.9% normal saline or D5W for delivery but the total drug concentration of the solution cannot 
be below 0.35 mg/ml. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. At the end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline.  
6.1.3 Administration of nivolumab  
Patients in all t wo arms (a total of 30  will receive preoperative treatment with nivolumab 
as a 30 +/ - 15-minute IV infusion on Day [ADDRESS_232179] cannot receive a following dose of the cycle within the designated time frame, it will be omitted and the 
next dose received will be considered Day 1 of the next cycle.  
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     28 Nivolumab should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
use of IV agents. Nivolumab is administered as an IV infusion only. 
Calculate Total Infusion Volume  as follows:  
(Total nivolumab dose in mg ÷ 10 mg/mL) + dilution volume = total infusion volume in mL  
Calculate Total Drug Concentration  as follows:  
Total nivolumab dose in mg ÷ Total infusion volume nivolumab dose in ml = total infusion volume 
in mg/mL.  
Total concentration cannot be below 0.35 mg/mL. 
Calculate Rate of Infusion  as follows:  
Total infusion volume in mL ÷ 30 minutes = rate of infusion in mL/min.  
Example:  
Flat dosing of 240 mg of nivolumab used. 
The total infusion volume would be 24 mL (240 mg ÷ 10 mg/mL = 24 mL) if no dilution volume 
is added. The total drug concentration would be 10 mg/mL (240 mg ÷ 24 mL = 10 mg/mL).  
The rate of infusion would be 0.80 mL/min in 30 minutes (24 mL ÷ 30 minutes = 0.80 mL/min).  
6.1.4  Patient Monitor ing During Infusion  
Patient vital signs should be monitored prior to dosing, about 15 minutes after initiation of 
the infusion (then every 15- 20 minutes as indicated), at [ADDRESS_232180] with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, 
hypo-  or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions 
should be reported within 24 hours to the BMS and reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusi on 
reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE (version 4.0) guidelines. 
Treatment recommendations for nivolumab related infusion reactions are provided below 
and may be modified based on MD Anderson treatment standards and guidelines, as appropriate : 
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     29 • For Grade 1 symptoms  (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention 
not indicated):  
o Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The 
following prophylactic pre -medications are recommended for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen [ADDRESS_232181] 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations.  
• For Grade 2 symptoms  (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [e.g. antihistamines, non -steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours):  
o Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal sal ine, and treat the 
subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen 325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropria te. 
If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur,  then no further nivolumab will be administered at that 
visit. Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_232182] 
be recorded on the case report form (CRF). The following prophylactic 
premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or 
equivalent) and/or acetaminophen [ADDRESS_232183] 
30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.  
• For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms  [Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged (i.e. not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_20309]/or brief interruption of infusi on); recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138] (e.g. renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates), Grade 4: life -threatening; pressor 
or ventilatory support indicated]:  
o Immediately discontinue i nfusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusion of normal 
saline, and treat the subject as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg 
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     30 of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as 
needed. Subject should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the 
symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be permanently discontinued. Institutional guidelines will be followed for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain 
at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. In the case of late -
occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g. appearance of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (e.g. 
oral antihistamine or corticosteroids).  
6.2  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (BMS -734016)  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a human immunoglobulin G (IgG1) κ anti -CTLA -4 monoclonal antibody 
(mAb). It is supplied in cle ar, colorless solution at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in 40ml vial.  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (BMS -734016) Injection (5 mg/ml), must be stored refrigerated (2 -  8°C) with 
protection from light. In preparation of infusion, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195676] 
(PVC , non- PVC/non- DEHP) or glass infusion containers at room temperature or refrigerated (2°C 
- 8°C) for up to [ADDRESS_232184] within 24 hours of 
preparation. This includes any time in transit plus the total time for the infusion. 
6.3.1 Dose Calculation of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195677]:  
Subject’s actual body weight in kg x 1 mg = total dose in mg Therefore, a subject weighing 70 kg who is to receive a dose of 1  mg/kg would be administered 
70 mg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (70 kg x 1 mg/kg = 70 mg). Dose adjustment is not allowed. 6.3.2 Administration of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195678] B is to receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 1 mg/kg dose IV every 6 weeks of 
treatment  for up to 4 dses after surgery. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195679] a 90 +/- 15-minute IV 
infusion, using a volumetric pump with a 0.2 to 1.2 micron in- line filter at the protocol- specified 
dose. The drug can be diluted with 0.9% normal saline or 5% Dextrose Injection to concentrations 
between 1 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. Care 
must be taken to assure sterility of the prepared solutions, since the drug product does not contain 
any antimicrobial preservatives or bacteriostatic agents.  
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     31 Please refer to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195680]/administration. 
6.3.3 Patient monitoring during Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195681], about 15 minutes after initiation of 
the in fusion (then every 15- 20 minutes as indicated), at [ADDRESS_232185] dosing. All vital sign time points will be afforded a 10- minute window. 
6.3.4 Treatment of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195682], it is less likely that any all ergic 
reaction will be seen in patients. However, it is possible that infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_232] a cytokine release syndrome that could be evidenced by [CONTACT_411], chills, rigors, rash, pruritus, hypo-  or 
hypertension, bronchospasm or other symptoms. No prophylactic pre -medication will be given 
unless indicated by [CONTACT_412].  
Reactions should be treated based upon the following recommendations:  
For mild symptoms (e.g., localized cutaneous reactions such as mild pruritus, flushing, rash):  
• Decrease the rate of infusion until recovery from symptoms, remain at bedside and monitor 
patient; 
• Complete the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_233];  
• Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV will be given prior to subsequent doses for patient who 
experience infusion reactions of ≥ grade 1.  
• Premedication with diphenhydramine may otherwise be given at the discretion of the 
Investigator for subsequent doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 
For moderate symptoms (any symptom not listed above [mild symptoms] or below [severe 
symptoms] such as generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, hypotension with systolic BP 
>80 mmHg):  
• Interrupt ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]; 
• Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV;  
• Monitor patient closely until resolution of symptoms;  
• Corticosteroids may abrogate any beneficial immunologic effect, but may be administered 
at the discretion of the treating physician;  
• Resume ipi[INVESTIGATOR_234];  
• At the discretio n of the treating physician, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195683], then increased incrementally to the initial infusion rate.  
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     32 • If symptoms develop after resumption of the infusion, the infusion should be discontinued and no additional ipi[INVESTIGATOR_236];  
• The next dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_237] -medication (diphenhydramine and acetaminophen) and careful monitoring, 
followin g the same treatment guidelines outlined above;  
• At the discretion of the treating physician additional oral or IV antihistamine may be administered prior to dosing with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 
For severe symptoms (e.g., any reaction such as bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, systolic 
blood pressure < 80 mm Hg, or angioedema):  
• Immediately discontinue infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and disconnect infusion tubing from the subject;  
• Consider bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1 mg IV or subcutaneously, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, with Solu- Medrol 100 mg IV, as needed.  
• Patients should be monitored until the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur;  
• No further ipi[INVESTIGATOR_239]; 
 In case of late- occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance within one week after 
treatment of a localized or generalized pruritus), symptomatic treatment may be given (e.g., oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).

     35 8.2 Continued Treatment beyond Progression of Disease  
Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of patients treated with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit from continued treatment despi[INVESTIGATOR_195688] 
[48]. For this reason, patients receiving nivolumab +/ - [ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]] will be permitted to continue 
study therapy beyond initial investigator -assessed REC IST 1.1- defined progression as long as they 
meet the 2 criteria listed below.  
• Investigator -assessed clinical benefit, and  
• Subject is tolerating study drug 
The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether the subject is clinically 
deteri orating and unlikely to receive further benefit from continued treatment. All decisions to 
continue treatment beyond initial progression post -surgery must be discussed with the MDACC 
IND Office and documented in the study records.  
Patients should discontin ue study therapy upon evidence of further progression, defined as an 
additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden from time of initial progression (including all 
target lesions and new measurable lesions).  
New lesions are considered measurable at the  time of initial progression if the longest diameter 
is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). Any new lesion considered non- measurable at the time of initial progression may become 
measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden measurement if the longest diameter 
increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have an increase in 
short axis to at least 15 mm).  
For statistical analyses that include the investigator -assessed progression date, patients who 
continue treatment beyond initial investigator -assessed, RECIST 1.1- defined progression will be 
considered to have investigator -assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial progression 
event.  
8.3  Destruction of Study Drug  
Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195689]. It is the Investigator’s responsibility 
to ensure that arrangements have been made for disposal and that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable regulations, guidelines, and i nstitutional procedures. 
Appropriate records of the disposal must be maintained.  
Protocol 2017- 0097

     36 8.4  Return of Study Drug  
If study drug will not be destroyed upon completion or termination of the study, all unused 
and/or partially used study drug that was supplied by [CONTACT_195728]. The return 
of study drug will be arranged by [CONTACT_20444]. It is the investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal 
of all empty containers, provided that procedures for proper disposal have been established 
according to applicable federal, state, local, and institutional guidelines and procedures, and 
provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept.

Concurrent medicat ions related to co -morbidity (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, etc.) and pre -medications prescribed by [CONTACT_195729].  Hydration, supportive medications, and routine surgical drugs will not be recorded in the database.  The patient will provide a 
list of medications taken within [ADDRESS_232193] during each clinic visit (see sectio n 10.0). The name, dose, date of start, 
date of stop (if use for short term), indication of the medication will be listed.  
The patient should not start a new prescription medication or over -the-counter medication before consulting with the study investigator, except in the 
case of a medical emergency. No other cancer/investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195690].

     51 [IP_ADDRESS] Medical History, Physical Exam, Physical Measurements  
Physical examination will be perf ormed at the time points outlined in Section 10.0. If the 
screening physical is conducted within 24 hours of dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1, then a single 
examination may count as both the screening and pre -dose evaluation. Pertinent medical history 
(physician di scretion) will be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_195734] 10.0. Orthostatic (supi[INVESTIGATOR_135456]) blood 
pressure and heart rate are to be measured for any subject who experience lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope or any similar complaints. 
[IP_ADDRESS] ECOG Status  
ECOG performance status will be evaluated continuously and documented at Screening 
and at each visit as outlined in S ection 10.0. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Baseline Symptoms  
Baseline signs and symptoms present within 2 weeks of starting therapy, whether or not 
related to current disease will be documented. Assessment of these baseline signs and symptoms 
will be done at each  treatment and Follow -Up Visit (see Section 10.1). Any worsening by > 1 
Grade change from baseline is to be documented as an adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Monitoring  
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or 
medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only 
considered adverse events if they worsen after starting st udy drug. Abnormal laboratory values or 
test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered 
clinically significant, or require therapy.  
Adverse events will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.[ADDRESS_232230] dose of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195693]. Events, such as abnormal laboratory values, considered by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_195694] (related to the study or study drug) will not be 
documented. The investigator (or physician designee) is responsible for verifying and 
Protocol 2017- [ADDRESS_232231] dose of study drug, me et Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for 
reporting as adverse events (AE), they will be documented in the AE source document and captured in the CORe/PDMS Database. For the lab results that do not meet the CTC for reporting 
as an AE, they will be considere d not clinically significant (NCS). No additional documentation 
will be required to neither specify NCS lab results nor require physician investigator signature.  
 
Adverse events will be treated appropriately. Such treatment m ay involve changes in 
nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195695], starting or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_058], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any other medically required intervention. Refer to Sections 6.1- [ADDRESS_232232]:  
• Event description  
• Date of onset of AE  
• CTCAE gra de/severity (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  
• Relationship to treatment with nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (unrelated, unlikely, possible, 
probable, highly probable/definite)  
• Action taken (none, temporarily discontinued agent, drug treatment given/specify, permanently discontinue d agent, non- drug treatment given/specify, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  
• Date of AE stop  
• Outcome (recovered without sequelae, recovered with sequelae, ongoing, worsened, death)  
• Serious AE (yes, no)  
• Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) must be collected from the time of the first protocol specific intervention until [ADDRESS_232233] dose of study drug. 
 
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     53 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related l aboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs.  
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  
1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation  > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  
AND  
2) Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_232234], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),  
AND  
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
 
Recommended Adverse Event Recording Guidelines  
 
Attribution  Grade [ADDRESS_232235] be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serum Chemistry  
Serum chemistry tests include: LDH, glucose, total protein, albumin, BUN or urea, 
creatinine, ALT, AST, serum alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, sodium, potassium, 
chloride, HCO3, calcium, magnesium, and uric acid. Serum Chemistry is to be obtained as outlined 
in Section 10.0. Three (3) ml of blood will be drawn for serum chemistry, exclusive of TSH. In addition, TSH, free T3, free T4, ACTH and total cortisol will also  be obtained as described in 
Section 10.0 to monitor endocrine side effects of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] . Lastly, AFP for tumor 
marker assessment will also be monitored.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematology  
CBC with differential are to be obtained as outlined in Section 5.1.  Complete Blood Count 
(CBC) with differential includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, eosinophils and monocytes. PT and PTT will be drawn at baseline and prior to surgery or future procedures. A dditional draws must be incorporated to monitor recovery from any 
hematologic laboratory AE. Two and a half (2.5) ml blood will be drawn for hematology. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Tissue  
Available tumor tissue, obtained at pre- treatment and the  time of surgical resect ion or 
biopsy (if unresectable)  will be collected for immune monitoring studies as described below 
(Section 10.3.3).  
10.3.3 Immune Tests  
The Immunotherapy Platform will perform immune monitoring, including but not limited 
to evaluation of CD4 and CD8 T cel ls in peripheral blood and available tumor samples as 
previously published [52 -59]. All samples will be collected and analyzed as per a separate IRB -
approved lab protocol.  
All blood collection will be compliant with institutional safety standards and will not 
exceed the maximum blood draw per venipuncture policy.

     55 10.3.4 Evaluation of Clinical Responses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Assessments  
Progression- free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR), each based on RECIST 
1.1 criteria, are two of the primary ef ficacy assessments of this study. See Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 
[IP_ADDRESS] for the definitions of ORR and PFS, respectively.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria for Progression and Responses  
Evaluation of response will follow the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECI ST) Guidelines. All tumor measurements must be recorded in centimeters.  
• Target Lesions:  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the longes t diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum longest diameter. The baseline sum of longest diameters will be used as the reference by [CONTACT_195735].  
• Non-target Lesions:  
All oth er lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non- target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or 
absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
• Evaluation of Tar get Lesions:  
− Complete Response : The disappearance of all target lesions.  
− Partial Response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter.  
− Progressive Disease : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since 
the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
− Stable Disease: Insufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response, or insufficient 
increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started.  
• Evaluation of Non- target Lesions:  
− Complete Response : The disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
Protocol 2017-0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     56 − Incomplete Response/Stable Disease: The persistence of one or more non- target 
lesion(s) 
− Progressive Disease: The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non- target lesions.  
• Evaluation of Best Overall R esponse: (see Table 4)  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).

Stable disease (SD)  50% decrease in tumor burden compared 
with baseline cannot be established nor 
25% increase compared with nadir  
Progression of disease (PD)  ≥25% increase in tumor burden compared 
with nadir (at any single time point) in two consecutive observations at least 4 weeks 
apart  
 
Note: According to the irRC, disease progression of non- index lesions or appearance of new non-
measurable lesions will not classify the subject as PD, and therefore the subject may stay in the 
study if it is the in the subject’s best interest. A confirmato ry tumor assessment may be performed 
no less than [ADDRESS_232236] should stay in the trial or be discontinued due to clinical 
progression based on th e investigator’s decision.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Time - to- Event Assessment of Response  
Time to Response : From the start of study drug to the first observation of a response (the first of 
two confirmatory measurements).  
Duration of Response : From the first observation  of a response (the first of the two confirmatory 
statements) to the first observation of progressive disease, or to death due to any cause, or early 
discontinuation of treatment due to progressive disease.  
Time to Progression: From the start of study drug to the first evidence of progression.

     58 11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
11.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) for M. D. Anderson -sponsored IND 
Protocols  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the patient, 
in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience 
as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_45790] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic b ronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
• Important medical events as def ined above, may also be considered serious adverse events. 
Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate 
by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_195696], IND Office.  
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Una nticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and 
Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).  
• All life -threaten ing or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related  to the study drug, 
must have a written report submitted within 24 hours  (next working day) of knowledge of 
the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     59 • Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
• Serious adverse events wi ll be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_232237] returned to baseline, progression of the event has 
stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_232238] be reported to the IND Office. This may include the development of a secondary malignancy.  
11.2 Reporting to FDA  
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 It is the r esponsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_195697], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.  
11.3 Investigator Communication with Supporting Companies  
• Adverse events classified as "serious" require expeditious handling and reporting to BMS 
to comply with regulatory requirements.  
• All SAEs whether related or unre lated to nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195698] b e immediately 
reported to BMS (by [CONTACT_1719]) within [ADDRESS_232239] be kept on file at 
the study site. 
All SAEs should be faxed (or emailed) to BMS at:  
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_9611] -Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number:  609- 818-3804 
Email: [EMAIL_178]
 
 
• For studies conducted under an Investigator IND, any event that is both serious and 
unexpected must be reported to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 7 days (deat h or life -threatening event) or 15 days (all other SAEs) after the investigator’s or 
institution’s initial receipt of the information.  The investigator will provide BMS with a simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed with the FDA.  SAEs will be repor ted on the 
MDACC SAE Form.  
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     60 • AE Reporting Period: For nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], all AEs must be collected which 
occur after the first dose through within 100 days of discontinuation of dosing or 
completion of the patient’s participation in the study if the last scheduled visit occurs at a later time.  In addition, the Investigator should notify BMS of any SAE that may occur after this time period which they believe to be certainly, probably, or possibly related to nivolumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] . 
• Worldwide.Safety@bms .com [EMAIL_177]  
 
Notes:  
• Cancer/Overdose: An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional ingestion of any 
dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important. For reporting 
purposes, any form of overdose, regardless of adverse outcome, will be cons idered as an 
important medical event and reported immediately to BMS.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (exceptions) :  Criteria for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_195699]:  
− Planned as per protocol medical/surgical procedure  
− Routine health assessment r equiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
documentation (e.g., routine colonoscopy)  
− Medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state (planned prior to entry into study trial; appropriate documentation required)  
− Admission encountered for other life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g. lack of housing, economic inadequacy, care- giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative)  
11.[ADDRESS_232240] agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control) prior to study 
entry, and for up to [ADDRESS_232241] study drug dose (for female study participants) or up to 
[ADDRESS_232242] study drug dose (for male study participants). The treating physician, principle investigator and BMS should be notified immediately, should a patient or patient’s sexual 
partner become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study.  
12.0 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
12.1 Preliminaries and Objectives  
This is a randomized, pi[INVESTIGATOR_195700] (Arm A) or nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (Arm B) as 
pre-operative treatment for patients with  hepatocellular  carcinoma who are eligible for surgical 
resection. Each patient in both Ar ms A  and B will be given nivolumab at 240 mg every 2 weeks 
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     61 for a total of 6 weeks. Patients in Arm B will additionally be treated concurrently with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79272] 1mg/kg every [ADDRESS_232243] hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of nivolumab +/ - ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] .  Secondary 
objectives include e stimating the ORR and TTP of the [ADDRESS_232244] been random ized. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_195639].  
 12.2 Endpoints  
12.2.1 Primary Endpoint: Safety  
Safety will be recorded through the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events and 
specific labor atory abnormalities (worst grade) in each treatment arm. Toxicities will be graded 
using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. For trial monitoring and decisions about future trials, extreme 
toxicities (TOX) will be defined as any grade [ADDRESS_232245] 13 of 15 subjects receiving their a ssigned 
therapy without grade 3 or higher adverse events necessitating a delay in the pre -established 
surgical resection date (a clinically driven end -point defined by [CONTACT_195736]).   
Protocol 2017- 0097 
   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     62 12.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Objective Response Rate  (ORR)  
Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the number of subjects with a best response of CR or 
PR after [ADDRESS_232246] 1.1 criteria divided by [CONTACT_195737] [IP_ADDRESS]  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Time to progression ( TTP)  
TTP is defined as the time from the start of study drug  to the first documented tumor progression 
or recurrence of tumor as determined by [CONTACT_26309] 1.[ADDRESS_232247] tumor assessment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] PFS 
PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to date of PD or recurrence or date of death 
whichever occurs  first if patients have a event, or to the last follow -up date if patients are alive 
without PD.  
12.2.3 Exploratory Endpoints   
Tissue and blood immune monitoring will be conducted through the Immunotherapy Platform 
based on samples collected  at the following time points: 1) Pre -treatment; 2) time of surgical 
resection or biopsy (if unresectable); and 3) at time of discontinuation (peripheral blood 
collection).   
12.3 Sample Size 
Up to 30 patients will be enrolled, for 15 patients each in arm. This sample size is based on having 
sufficient patients to assess toxicities in each arm while providing preliminary estimates of 
secondary endpoints for future trials.   
12.4  Randomization 
Patients in the resectable cohorts will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_232248] website ( https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct ), which is housed on 
a secure server at MDACC and maintained by [CONTACT_128127]. Access 
to the website will be gained through usernames and passwords provided by [CONTACT_195738]. Training on the use of 
Protocol 2017- [ADDRESS_232249] one dose of nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195701].  
Safety assessments will include a comprehensive evaluation of AEs and/or toxicity based on:  
• Results of monitoring vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body 
temperature)  
• Results of clinical chemistry, hematology/coagulation, complement testing, thyroid 
function testing, and urine analysis tests  
• ECG results   
• Changes in physical examination  
• Need for concomitant medications  
• ISRs  
• ECOG performance status

   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     64 12.6 Data Analyses   
This is a t wo arm, open- label pi[INVESTIGATOR_195702].  Since no effective treatments are available in 
this setting, a response rate of 15% (within 95% CI) is consi dered acceptable – i.e., the signal for 
launching further, larger studies with nivolumab or nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195703] ≥ 1 response in the current study (each arm).  If no response is observed, the treatment 
with nivolumab alone or in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195704]. A total 
of 15 patients will be enrolled in each arm and treated to rule out a response rate of 15% or less with 90% power when at least one response is observed.  In other words, with [ADDRESS_232250] one response is more than 90% if the response rate is at least  
15%.  Descriptive statistics including with 90% confidence interval will be computed. Observed response profile, clinical benefit rate at 6 m onths and TTP  along with relevant confidence intervals 
will be used to guide future development decisions. 
Total evaluable patients  Number of responders  Response rate  Lower 90% CI*  Upper 90% CI*  
15 0 0% <1%  18% 
15 1 7% <1%  27% 
15 2 13% 2% 36%

15 6 40% 19% 64% 
15 7 47% 24% 70% 
15 8 53% 30% 76% 
15 9 60% 36% 81% 
15 10 67% 43% 86% 
15 >10**  >67%  >43%  >86%  
* Exact confidence interval computed by [CONTACT_180756] (Biometrika 26:404-
413, 1934)  
The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate probability of PFS for each treatment arm.  
 Our exploratory objectives are to characterize the immune response for both treatment arms and 
its correlation to treatment response.   Immune responses, such as infiltration of CD8+/CD4+ T 
cells and dendritic cells, and cytokine levels in blood, will be compared between pre -treatment and 
post-treatment via paired t -test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. The overall treatment response rate 
will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_195739] n, percentage, and 95% CIs. Comparison of the response rates between two treatment arms will be made via Fisher’s exact test  Association 
Protocol 2017- [ADDRESS_232251]. 
 
The Investigator is responsible for completing a Safety/Efficacy Summary Report, and submitting 
it to the IND Office Medical Affairs and Safety Group, for review and approval.  This should be 
submitted after the first 5 evaluable patients per arm, complete 14  weeks of study treatment, and 
every 5 evaluable patients per arm, thereafter. On every summary submission, toxicity will be assessed at week 6, and response at week 14 of study treatment . 
A copy of the cohort summary should be placed in the Investigator’s Regulatory Binder under “sponsor correspondence”. 
13.[ADDRESS_232252] be conducted as described in the final approved protocol.  Documentation 
of approval signed by [CONTACT_12715](s) must be sent to BMS protocol 
managers  by [CONTACT_978]/research team .  All revisions (protocol amendments, administrative letters, and 
changes to the informed consent) must be submitted to BMS protocol managers.  The Investigator 
should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior review and documented approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_195705], except where necessary 
to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study patients. 
13.[ADDRESS_232253] all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation (e.g. case report form) on each  individual treated with nivolumab +/ - [ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]]. The investigator is required to

   January 30, 2020  
 
 
     66 retain, in a confidential manner, the data pertinent to the study. CORe/PDMS will be used as the 
electronic case report form for this study. All protocol specific data, including adverse events, will 
be entered into  CORe/PDMS . This study will be monitored for compliance by [CONTACT_62680].  
13.[ADDRESS_232254] (IRB)  
Before study initiation, the Investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_195706], consent form, subject recruitment materials/process (e.g., 
advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to study subjects. The 
Investigator should also provide the IRB with a copy of the Investigator Brochure or product labeling information to be provided to patients.  
The Investigator should provide the IRB with reports, updates and other information (e.g., 
Amendments, Administrative Letters) according to regulatory requirements or Institution procedures. A  detailed list of required regulatory documents also to be submitted to BMS will be 
sent upon final approval of the protocol.  
13.[ADDRESS_232255] all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation (e.g. case report form) for the maximum period required by [CONTACT_8666], or Institution procedures. If the Investigator withdraws from the study 
(e.g. relocation, retirement), the records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee 
(e.g. another Investigator, IRB). Documentation of such transfer must be provided to BMS.

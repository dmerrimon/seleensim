Version Date  29 February 2016  3.0 INTRODUCTION 
3.1 Background  
Non Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHLs) are the most common hematologic malignancy with 
annual US incidence of approximately 66,000 in the US  1.  NHLs are a heterogeneous 
group of lymphoproliferative malignancies with differing patterns of behavior and 
responses to treatment  2.  NHL is much less predictable than Hodgkin Lymphoma and has 
a far greater predilection to disseminate to extranodal sites.  NHLs can be divided into 2 
prognostic groups:  indolent and aggressive lymphomas.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_619083], many patients with these diseases still die from relapse and disease progression 
or from complications associated with treatment; therefore, more selective and less toxic 
treatments are needed. Constitutive activation of the JAK -STAT pathway has been 
reported in various types of leukemias and lymphomas, suggesting that targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_619084]. More recent 
reports have als o identified activating mutations or gene amplification of JAK1 and JAK2 
in acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemias, lymphoma and in myelodysplastic syndrome  
3-13.  As with many therapeutics, selective JAK inhibitors may be most 
beneficial when combined with other targeted or cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].    
 
Ruxolitinib phosphate (also known as I NCB018424 phosphate  or INC424) is an inhibitor 
of the Janus kinase fami ly of prot ein tyrosine kinases and will be referred to as ruxolitinib 
throughout this document.  Ruxolitinib  is an investigational product that is in 
development for treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), hematologic 
malignancies and solid tumors. JAKs pl ay an important role in signal transduction 
following cytokine and growth factor binding to their receptors. Aberrant activation of JAKs has been associated with increased malignant cell proliferation and survival.   In 
particular, a pathologic role for JA K2 has recently been suggested for the majority of 
patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative MPNs. Therefore, JAK inhibitors represent potential therapeutic agents for these disease states.  
Clinical Summary  
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment 7   CONFIDENTIAL    Page 12 of 75 
Version Date  29 February 2016  Ruxolitinib has been administered to over 180 healthy volunteers as single, repeat single, 
or multiple doses of up to 10 days duration.  Ithas also been administered to 
approximately 450 subjects with MF for periods of up to > 24 months, and over 
100 subjects with prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, p olycythemia vera or essential 
thrombocythemia for periods of up to > [ADDRESS_822875] of ruxolitininb blocking IL -6 
signaling and causing neutrophil margination on blood vessel walls.  In a repeat dose healthy volunteer study, neutropenia of any severity grade was seen in 22% of placebo 
subjects, 11% of subjects receiving 50 mg qd, 67% of subjects receiving 100 mg qd, 13% 
of subjects receiving 15 mg bid, 33% of subjects receiving 25 mg bid and 67% of subjects receiving [ADDRESS_822876] receiving a 50 mg bid dose ( NOTE: This was 
the highest dose  administered during any clinical study).  The maximum tolerated dose in 
healthy volunteers was determined to be 25 mg bid and no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were seen at 100 mg qd.  (See the Investigator’s Brochure for additional details ).  
Ruxolitinib was tolerated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis dosed up to [ADDRESS_822877] dosed with 
25 mg bid was withdrawn due to nausea and vomiting.   ( See the Investigator’s Brochure 
for additional details ).  
 In a study of patients with advanced prostate cancer, ruxol itinib  was generally well 
tolerated.  Serious adverse events seen were generally related to the expected progression of the underlying disease of prostate cancer.  One patient, with a history of congestive

additional details ).  
 
In a study of patients with advanced multiple myeloma, ruxolitinib  was generally well 
tolerated.  Observed toxicities included thrombocytopenia and anemia.  SAE’s reported included disease progression, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, anemia, pyrexia and 
other cardiac and pulmonary complications.  Safety results were consistent with those 
observed in other  ruxolitinib  studies.   ( See the Investigator’s Brochure for additional 
details ).  
 In a study of patients with Advanced Polycythemia Vera (PV) or Essential 
Thrombocythemia (ET),  ruxolitinib  was generally well tolerated.  The most commonly 
observed AEs were anemia in ET subjects and anemia and thrombocytopenia in PV subjects, and these were reversible with dose modifications.  Serious adverse events 
deemed at least possibly related to study m edication included a case of atrial flutter in a 
PV subject which resolved; acute renal failure in a n ET subject which resolved; and a 
renal tumor in a PV subject which was surgically resected and the subject recovered.   (See the Investigator’s Brochure f or additional details ).  
 In an ongoing study in subjects with myelofibrosis (MF) where median time on drug is 
~ 15 months (N=154),  ruxolitinib  was well tolerated by [CONTACT_488264] (median 
age 65) with advanced disease.  The DLT was thrombocytope nia.  Initial dose ranging 
established an MTD of [ADDRESS_822879] 5%  (8 subjects) of the 
154 subjects included in the safety database through December 31, 2009 were restricted to anemia (45 subjects), thrombocytopenia (66 subjects), weight increased (11 subjects), 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment 7   CONFIDENTIAL    Page 14 of 75 
Version Date  29 February 2016  diarrhea (10 subjects) and fatigue (8 subjects).  Both anem ia and thrombocytopenia 
represent JAK -inhibitor induced myelosuppression.  Forty (40) subjects (26% of study 
population) had a Grade 3 or Grade 4 decline in platelet count during the study (31 Grade 
3 events, 9 Grade 4 events).  Subjects with Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia entered the 
study, in general, with platelet counts less than 200 K/µL, although there are exceptions 
to this trend.  Twenty percent of Grade 3 + [ADDRESS_822880] under half (48%) of G rade 3 + [ADDRESS_822881] subjects, thrombocytopenia was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_619085]/or dose  reduction.  Anemia, in general, reflected 
the low hemoglobin status at baseline in this disease population.    
Ruxolitinib  has demonstrated marked reduction in spleen size in the ongoing study in 
patients with MF, and without regard to presence of the JAK 2 V617F mutation.  In 
addition to spleen size reduction, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores 
and symptoms thought to be related to splenomegaly, as well as symptoms related to 
elevated cytokine levels, all show improvement with  ruxolitinib  treatment.  As a 
surrogate marker for functional benefit, exercise capacity was assessed with a standardized six minute walk test (6MWT).   ruxolitinib  therapy resulted in improved 
6MWT performance after 1, 3 or 6 months of therapy.  After an initial small w eight loss 
likely due to resolution of ascites and/or reduction in splenomegaly, there is an increase 
in total body weight; importantly, there is weight gain in subjects with low body mass 
index at entry, i .e., cachectic subjects.   See the Investigator’s Brochure for additional 
details.   
In Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 256 in patients with advanced PV or ET, and after a median 
follow -up of 15 months (range 8- 21), 97% of enrolled PV subjects achieved Hct control 
to < 45% in the absence of phlebotomy, and all continued to maintain phlebotomy-
independence at the time of last follow -up visit.   Prior to treatment with ruxolitinib , 
twenty -six subjects were phlebotomy- dependent with the majority being maintained on 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment [ADDRESS_822882] %, WBC count, and platelet counts have been noted (Table 18).  
Leukocytosis > 15 x 109/L was present in 44% of subjects at baseline a nd improved ( ≤ 15 
x 109/L) or normalized ( ≤ upper limit of normal, ULN) in 87% and 67% of these subjects, 
respectively.  Thrombocytosis > 600 x 109/L was present in 38% of subjects at baseline 
and improved ( ≤ 600 x 109/L) or normalized (< ULN) in 92% and 69%, respectively.   
See the Investigator’s Brochure for additional details.  
 
Two Phase [ADDRESS_822883] available therapy in subjects with MF.  In both Phase 3 studies, 
subjects begin dosing at 20 mg bid if their platelet count at study entry is >  200,000/µL 
and at 15 mg bid for a platelet count at study entry of 100,000 to 200,000/µL, inclusive. 
 
3.2 Trial Rationale  
This study is designed to investigate potential benefits of ruxolitinib in patients with Non -
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, DLBC subtype and PTCL.  This will be the first study of 
ruxolitinib  in patients with lymphoma.   The pre -clinical data provide support for the use 
of ruxolitinib  in targeting the JAK -STAT pathway for the treatment of lymphomas. 
For the potential treatment of neoplastic disease ruxolitinib  was evaluated in two mouse 
models where either a cytokine- dependent multiple myeloma cell line, INA -6, or a B aF3 
cell line engineered to express JAK2V617F was inoculated. R uxolitinib  administration 
(oral, bid) inhibited JAK -STAT signaling and INA -6 tumor growth in a dose -dependent 
manner as demonstrated by [CONTACT_619093] (TGI) and reduction i n 
pSTAT3 levels determined by [CONTACT_6428]. Based on the data obtained from this study, it appears that > 80% suppression of JAK -STAT signaling for a minimum of 8 h each day 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment 7   CONFIDENTIAL    Page 16 of 75 
Version Date  29 February 2016  (4 h following each of two daily doses), and not continuous JAK inhibition, is required 
for maximal suppression of tumor growth in this model . 
 Ruxolitinib  is an inhibitor of the Janus kinase family of protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs).  
Subject eligibility criteria are consistent with those used in studies of this population.  
The multi- center nature of this study provides greater likelihood that the results will have 
general applicability.

Protocol # 283-11, Amendment [ADDRESS_822885] prominent toxicity seen in earlier studies, the baseline platelet count will be used to 
guide the initial dose , either 15 mg po BID or 10 mg po BID (see section 9.2) .  Doses 
may be decreased in the presence of toxicities, or may be increased in the absence of toxicity and lack of objective response to a maximum dose of 25 mg po BID.

bottles. The bottles will include labeling “New Drug -  Limited by  [CONTACT_4496] ([LOCATION_003]) Law to 
Investigational Use”.  
9.1.3 Storage/Stability  
The bottles of tablets should be stored at room temperature, 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). 
Stability stud ies will be conducted on all clinical batches to support the clinical trial.  
9.1.4 Drug Accountability 
Responsibility for drug accountability at the study site rests with the Investigator; 
however, the Investigator may assign some of the drug accountability duties to an 
appropriate pharmacist or designee.  Inventory and accountability records must be 
maintained and readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_619097]. 
 
The Investigator or designee will be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and 
partially used containers of study medication until the end of the study.  The Investigator 
or designee must maintain records that document:  
• investigational product delivery to the study site  
• the inventory at the site  
• use by [CONTACT_488308][INVESTIGATOR_4382]/unit counts from each supply dispensed  
• product returned to the Investigator or designee.   
 
These records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers (if  available), and the 
unique code numbers (if available) assigned to the investigational product and study 
subjects.   
 
 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment [ADDRESS_822916] be used only in accordance with the protocol.  The 
Investigator will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were 
provided the study medication specified.  
  Completed accountability records will be archived by [CONTACT_779].  If any unused ruxolitinib 
bottles remain at the end of the study, they will be accounted for at the site close -out visit.  
If a site is able to destroy ruxolitinib at their premises, or through a certified vendor, they may do so upon authorization by [CONTACT_1034], provided their destruction policy is made 
available to the Sponsor.  
 
9.2 Administration of Study Medication  
9.2.1     Starting Dose Assignment  
Continuous BID dosing is planned.  A cycle is 28 days of BID dosing. The starting dose 
of ruxolitinib  tablets will be determined based on Baseline platelet  count as follows:  
• Subjects with Baseline platelet co unt >  100,000/μL will begin dosing at 15  mg BID 
(three 5 mg tablets  BID) .   
• Subjects with Baseline platelet count of 75,000/μL to <1 00,000/μL will begin dosing at 
10 mg BID ( two 5 mg tablets BID) . 
A standardized dosing paradigm will be used to determine dose adjustments for safety 
and efficacy so that each subject is titrated to their most appropriate dose. Doses will not  
exceed 25 mg BID.  
 
9.2.2      Dose Increases  
The initial dose of ruxolitinib  will be determined by [CONTACT_619098].   
After every 2 cycles   (post cycle 2,  4, 6, etc.) of therapy, at the discretion of the 
 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment 7   CONFIDENTIAL    Page 33 of 75

25 mg BID  for subjects wh o meet all three of the following conditions:  
1. Inadequate efficacy is demonstrated by [CONTACT_619099].  
2. Platelet count is ≥ 50,000/μL and platelet count has  never been below 50,000/μL  at a 
prior laboratory evaluation since Baseline.  
3. Absolute neutrophil count levels have remained at or above 1000/μL since  baseline.  
4. No grade [ADDRESS_822917]  weekly for platelet count < 50,000/μL or ANC < 1000/μL 
and at least two times weekly for platelet count < 25,000/μL or ANC < 500/μL.  Dosing 
may be restarted or increased following recovery of toxicities  to acceptable levels.  
Subjects with hematologic toxicities requiring dose holds for [ADDRESS_822918], with increases in dose not more than in 
increments of 5 mg BID and not more often than every 2 cycles .

Version Date  29 February 2016  11.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.1 Definitions and Reporting  
An Adverse Event for the purposes of this protocol is defined as the appearance of (or 
worsening of any pre -existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) 
that occur after subject’s signed informed consent has been obtained. Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute Adverse 
Events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically 
significant, require therapy (e.g., hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion), or 
require changes in study medication(s).  
Adverse Events that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded in the Adverse Events section of the eCRF . Conditions that were already pr esent at the time of 
informed consent should be recorded in the Medical History section of the eCRF . 
Adverse Event monitoring should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_822926] 
dose of study treatment. Adverse Events (including lab abnormalities t hat constitute AEs) 
should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign 
or symptom should be reported as a separate Adverse Event.  
Adverse Events will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0).  If CTCAE grading does not exist for an Adverse 
Event, the severity of mild, moderate, severe, and life -threatening, or grades 1 -  4, will be 
used. C TCAE grade 5 (death) will not be used in this study; rather, information about 
deaths will be collected as an outcome of the event. The occurrence of Adverse Events should be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning of the subject during the screening process 
after signing informed consent and at each visit during the study. Adverse Events also 
may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_165936], or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assess ments. As 
far as possible, each Adverse Event should be evaluated to determine:  
• The severity grade (CTCAE grade 1 -4) 
• Reasonable possibility that AE is related to the study treatment: (no, yes)  
 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment 7   CONFIDENTIAL    Page 41 of 75 
Version Date  29 February 2016  • Start and end dates, unless unresolved at final exam  
• Action ta ken with respect to study drug (none, dose adjusted, temporarily 
interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable)  
• Outcome (not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown ) 
• Whether it is serious, as per SAE definition provided in Section 11.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special 
reporting requirements, see Section 11.3.2.  
All Adverse Events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or non-drug therapy is given, this action should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF . 
Once an Adverse Event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, 
if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
Disease progression should not be regarded or reported as an Adverse Event itself unless associated with a separate Adverse Event.  
Participating sites must agree to comply by [CONTACT_619102] ( DSMC ) procedures. The DSMC will monitor the protocol on at least a 
quarterly basis and as request ed.  Sites must also comply with their local IRB 
requirements.  All grade  3 and grade 4 adverse events  and all Serious Adverse Events  will 
be reported to the UNMC Eppley Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) via the UNMC study coordinator. Sites will be provided with applicable policies 
and are required to e nter all adverse events into the eCRF .  Adverse Event information 
will be collected from the eCRF database and reported to the UNMC DSMC.  
11.[ADDRESS_822927] Abnormalities  
Definitions and Reporting  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an Adverse Event in t heir own right (are 
considered clinically significant, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy or require changes in study treatment), should be recorded on the Adverse Events 
 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment 7   CONFIDENTIAL    Page 42 of 75 
Version Date  29 February 2016  eCRF . Whenever possible, a diagnosis, rather than a sympt om should be provided (e.g. 
anemia instead of low hemoglobin). Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for 
Adverse Events should be followed until they have returned to normal or an adequate 
explanation of the abnormality is found. When an abnormal  laboratory or test result 
corresponds to a sign/symptom of an already reported Adverse Event, it is not necessary to separately record the lab/test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities, that do not meet the definition of an Adverse Event, should not be reported as Adverse Events. A grade 3 or 4 event (severe) as per CTCAE does not 
automatically indicate a SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as defined below 
and/or as per investigator’s discretion. A dose hold or medication for the lab abnormality 
may be required by [CONTACT_488297] 8.6 and should not contribute to designation of 
a lab parameter abnormality as a SAE:  
11.3 Serious Adverse Events  
11.3.1   Definitions  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as one of the following:   
• Is fatal or life -threatening (that is, immediate risk of dying)  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above. Considered significant by [CONTACT_619103] 
(s) that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212981] a serious adverse event (s ) when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:

o Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not re sulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517]  
o Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_108999]’s general condition 
o Any SAEs that are expected due to the condition being treated, including 
if the SAE is a primary outcome measure, and whether there has been a 
clear agreement with regulators not to consider these as SAEs, provided the information is collected elsewhere  
11.3.[ADDRESS_822928] been caused by a protocol procedure.   Previously planned (prior to 
signing the informed consent document ) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless 
the underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the study. 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form. The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to the  
 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment [ADDRESS_822929] assess if there is a Reasonable possibility that SAE is related to the study treatment: (no, yes)  
All serious adverse events regardless of seve rity or relationship must be reported to the 
sponsor -investigator within 24 hours of the investigational staff’s knowledge. Please send 
a completed SAE form to:

The populations to be analyzed include the following:  
Intent -to-treat (ITT) population  - Subjects enrolled in the study. 
Evaluable population – Subjects who had completed [ADDRESS_822934] one dose of study 
medication.  
 
12.2 Efficacy Analysis  
Primary efficacy analyses will be based on both the ITT and evaluable populations. 
Secondary efficacy analyses will be based on ITT population only.

after [ADDRESS_822936]  cohort s.  The description provided in this section 
includes the primary analyses for the prima ry objective. 
Statistical hypothesis and sample size justification  
Subjects meeting the stated eligibility requirements will be enrolled onto the study. 
Subjects will be grouped into cohorts 1) DLBCL ABC 2) DLBCL GCB 3) PTCL  and 4) 
OTHER SUBTYPES (subject s who are not able to be placed into cohorts 1, 2, and 3),  
based upon a central determination of immunohistochemistry and gene -expression  
profile.   A target sample size of [ADDRESS_822937] s. There is no minimum or 
maximum requirement for Cohort 4, since there is a very low number of subjects anticipated for this cohort. (Maximum in all cohorts is [ADDRESS_822938] s). 
 These sample sizes are based on a 3 -stage design of alpha=0.07 with power of 77% 
(beta=0. 23) to test the null hypothesis that ORR  after 6 cycles  will be ≤  10% (not 
considered clinically compelling) versus the alternative hypothesis that ORR will be ≥ 
25% (considered clinically meaningful in this patient population) within each cohort. 
Based on the simulation study, to maintain the above type I and II errors, t wo interim 
analyses for futility will be performed for each cohort separately according to the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]:  
1) The first interim analysis w ill occur when [ADDRESS_822939] been enrolled in the 
cohort.  If there are any responders (CR+PR) observed among the 10 subjects, 
enrollment will continue; otherwise, enrollment will be suspended and these [ADDRESS_822940] been fully assessed a fter 6 cycles , 
the trial will be terminated for futility.  
 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment 7   CONFIDENTIAL    Page 48 of 75

the cohort. If there are 3 or more responders (CR+PR) observed among the 
20 subjects, enrollment will continue; otherwise, enrollment will be suspended 
and these 20 subjects will be followed to f urther assess their responses. During 
this follow -up, as soon as 3 or more responders are observed, enrollment will 
resume. If there are <  [ADDRESS_822942] been fully 
assessed, the trial will be terminated for futility.  
3) At the end of the trial, if there are ≥ 6 responders (CR+PR) observed among the 
30 subjects, the null hypothesis will be rejected and the drug is valuable to pursue further research ; otherwise we fail to reject the null hypothesis and futility of the 
drug will  be claimed.

586 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma by [CONTACT_90023] D. Cheson,  
 
CR 
The designation of CR requires the following  
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-
related s ymptoms if present before therapy.  
2a. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma: in patients with no pretreatment PET scan or when 
the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post -treatment residual mass of any size is 
permitted as long as it is PET negative.  
2b. Var iably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed on CT to normal size (≤ 1.[ADDRESS_822965] transverse diameter  for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy). Previously involved nodes that 
were 1.[ADDRESS_822966] decreased to ≤ 1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.  
3. The spleen and/or l iver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a 
physical examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and 
should be considered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related to lymphoma should disappear. However , determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable 
because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or causes other than lymphoma.  
4. If the bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_22679], the infiltrate must 
have cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy sample on which this determination is made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilate ral core). If the 
sample is indeterminate by [CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by [CONTACT_9064]. 
A sample that is negative by [CONTACT_248288] a small population of clonal lymphocytes by [CONTACT_127891] a CR until data 
become available demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.  
CRu  
The use of the above definition for CR and that below for PR eliminates the category of 
CRu.  
 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment 7   CONFIDENTIAL    Page 64 of 75 
Version Date  29 February 2016  PR 
The designation of PR requires all of the following:  
1. At least a 50% d ecrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six 
of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be 
selected according to all of the following: they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimen sions; if possible they should be from disparate regions 
of the body; and they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.  
2. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.  
3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥ 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the greatest transverse diameter.  
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually assessable and no measurable disease sho uld be present.  
5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was positive before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified (eg, large- cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve  a CR 
by [CONTACT_86950], but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow 
involvement will be considered partial responders.  
When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after treat ment, patients should be 
considered partial responders.  
6. No new sites of disease should be observed.  
7. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma: for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if 
the PET scan was positive before therapy, the post -treatment PET should be 
positive in at least one previously involved site.  
8. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown: for patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be used.  
Stable Disease Stable disease (SD) is defined as the following:  
1. A patient is considered  to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed 
for a CR or PR, but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see Relapsed Disease [after CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).  
2. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20358] -avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at prior sites of 
disease with no new areas of involvement on the post -treatment CT or PET.  
3. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown: for patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in  the size of the previous lesions on the post -treatment CT scan.  
Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD)  
Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more than 1.5 cm regardless of the short axis. If a lymph node ha s a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should 
 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment 7   CONFIDENTIAL    Page 65 of 75 
Version Date  29 February 2016  only be considered abnormal if its short axis is more than 1.0. Lymph nodes ≤ 1.0 x ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_822967] a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of  any previously involved nodes, or 
in a single involved node, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic or hepatic nodules). To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of less than 1.[ADDRESS_822968] increase by ≥ 50% and to a size of 1.[ADDRESS_822969] a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node more than 1 cm in its short axis.  
4. Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359] -avid l ymphoma or 
the lesion was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current PET systems (< 1.[ADDRESS_822970]).  
Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal disease.  For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease. Disease that 
is only assessable (eg, pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or absent only, unless, while an abnormality is still noted by [CONTACT_619110], it is found to be histologically negative.

required for all subjects.  Either excisional tumor biopsy or two 14 gauge (or larger) cores will be collected and submitted to the Central lab.  The central lab will perform morphologic review and gene expression profiling.  No reports from the central lab will be provided back to the investigator and site  but the  tumor content and degree of necrosis 
and degeneration will be recorded in the database. If a formal pathology review is 
required for clinical use, please collect additional tissue  for review by [CONTACT_619111].  
 Preparing tissue for transport to the Central Labs:  
 1.  Collect either an excisional biopsy or two [ADDRESS_822976] immediately (within 15 minutes).   
 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment [ADDRESS_822977] within 60 minutes of tissue collection, and each of the core biopsies or the excisional biopsy is divided into two halves.  Label the halves of each biopsy “A” and “B”.   Label according to the illustration:

A. CYTOKINE Plasma Sample Blood Collection and preparation  (includes C -
reactive protein analysis at pretreatment  and at cycle 2, day 1)  
  
1.  Collect 7cc to 10cc whole blood into EDTA tubes (Purple  top).  * At Cycle 1, 
day 1 predose timepoint only: Make two to three blood smear slides  and air dr y, 
and save them at room temperature until shipment to the central lab.  
 
2.  Process within 2 hours of collection.  Cells are removed from plasma by [CONTACT_7873] 10 minutes at 1,000- 2,000 rpm  using a refrigerated centrifuge. 
Centrifugation for 15 minutes at 2,000 rpm  depletes platelets in the plasma sample. 
The resulting supernatant is designated plasma.  
 
3.  Following centrifugation, immediately transfer the plasma apportioned into two 
clean polypropylene aliquot tubes using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462]. The samples should be 
main tained at 2 -8°C while handling. Store and at – 20°C, or lower until shipment to 
the central lab. It is important to avoid freeze/thaw cycles. Samples which are hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic can invalidate certain tests.  
 
4.  Transfer the cell pellet to a 50 ml Falcon tube which contains 40 ml ice cold ddH2O. Mix it gently by [CONTACT_619113] (about 10 sec). Then divide the mixture into two 50mL Falcon tubes in equal volume, add 25 ml 2 X PBS in each tube and mix it gently by [CONTACT_619114]. 
Centrifuge the tubes at 1000 rpm (250g) for [ADDRESS_822981] the cell pellet in - 80°C until shipment to the central lab. Label it with 
whole cell pellet.  
 
5. Send blood smear, plasma sample and whole cell pellet to the central lab according to the shipment instruction below.   B.  C YTOKINE P eripheral B lood 
Mononuclear C ell (PBMC)  Sample Collection and preparation   
1.  Collect 10cc whole blood into EDTA tubes ( purple top). Process within 2 hours 
of collection according to Ficoll -Hypaque method:  
 
2.  Place fresh heparinized blood into 15-  or 50- ml conical centrifuge tubes. Using a 
sterile pi[INVESTIGATOR_8459] , add an equal volume of room -temperature 1 × PBS. Mix well.  
 
 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment 7   CONFIDENTIAL    Page 71 of 75 
Version Date  29 February 2016  3.  Pellet the leukocyte/RBC fraction by [CONTACT_619115] 15 min at 200 × g, 
room temperature. The platelet cell fraction will remain in the upper suspension. Using a sterile pi[INVESTIGATOR_8459], remove the supernatant suspension containing this platelet cell 
fraction.  The blood should immediately be gently mixed, and should be examined 
when it reaches the labo ratory for small blood clots. As the clotting reaction 
releases proteins that can affect lymphocyte phenotype and function, samples 
containing clots should be discarded. 
  
4.  Using a sterile pi[INVESTIGATOR_8459], add an equal volume of room- temperature 1× PBS 
suspension (if utilizing a 15 -ml conical tube) or bring the leukocyte/RBC cell 
suspension to a final volume of 40 ml with 1× PBS (if utilizing a 50 -ml conical 
tube).  5.  Slowly layer the F icoll-Hypaque solution underneath the leukocyte/RBC/PBS 
mixture by [CONTACT_619116][INVESTIGATOR_619089]-Hypaque at the bottom 
of the sample tube. Use 3ml Ficoll-Hypaque per 10ml blood/PBS mixture. Use a 
maximum of 10 ml Ficoll-Hypaque per 40 ml leukocyte/ RBC/PBS mixture.  
 
To maintain the Ficoll-Hypaque/blood interface, it is helpful to hold the centrifuge 
tube at a 45 ◦ angle. Alternatively, the leukocyte/RBC/PBS mixture may be slowly 
layered over the Ficoll -Hypaque solution. See Figure below.  
 
6.  Centrifuge 20 to 30 min at 2000 rpm (900 × g), 18 ◦ to 20◦ C, with no brake. 
After a centrifugation with Ficoll-Hypaque, platelets (specific gravity, 1.040) and 
plasma (specific gravity, 1.025 to 1.029) are located above the Ficoll-Hypaque, lymphocytes (specific gravity, 1.070), and some platelets are found at the plasma-

 
Protocol # 283-11, Amendment 7   CONFIDENTIAL    Page 72 of 75 
Version Date  29 February 2016  Ficoll- Hypaque interface. Granulocytes (specific gravity, 1.087 to 1.092) and RBCs 
(specific gravity,  1.093 to 1.096) form a cell pellet at the bottom of the tube (see 
Fig. below) 
 
7. Using a sterile pi[INVESTIGATOR_8459], remove the upper layer that contains the plasma and most of 
the remaining cell platelet fraction. Using another pi[INVESTIGATOR_8459], transfer the mononuclear lymphocyte cell layer to another centrifuge tube. This will appear as a white, cloudy band between the plasma and the Ficoll-Hypaque layers. Wash cells by [CONTACT_619117] (∼3 times the volume of the mononuclear cell layer) and centrifuging 10 min 
at 450 to 600× g, 18◦  to 20◦ C. Remove supernatant, re-suspend cells in HBSS, and 
repeat the wash once to remove any remaining platelets. 
 
The washing steps described above usually remove most of the platelets from the 
mononuclear cell suspension. There are certain disease states associated with increased platelet concentrations (mononuclear cell to platelet cell ratio >10:1) in the peripheral blood, and additional steps are needed to remove the extra platelets in 
these cases. Add 3 ml FBS to a centrifuge tube for each milliliter of mononuclear 
cells. Layer the cell suspension (1 -2 × 107 cells/ml) over the FBS (alternatively, 
carefully layer t he FBS under the cell suspension, which will rise as FBS is added). 
Centrifuge 15 min at 150 × g, 18◦  to 20◦ C. Discard the supernatant containing the 
platelets. Re -suspend cell pellet in complete RPMI -1640 and proceed as in step 8. 
8.  Re -suspend mononucle ar lymphocyte cells in complete RPMI -1640. Count cells 
and determine viability by [CONTACT_132422]. If desired, purity of PBMC population can be determined by [CONTACT_4133]. 
9. Centrifuge 5 min at 2000 × g, 18
◦ to 20◦C. Discard the supernatant and sa ve the 
PBMC in -80°C until shipment to the central lab. Label it clearly with “PBMC” and 
estimate cell number.

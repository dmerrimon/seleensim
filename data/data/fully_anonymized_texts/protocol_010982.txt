Although fetal s upraventricular tachyarrhythmia s (SVAs), including atrial flutter (AF) and other forms of 
supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), are the most common causes of intended in -utero fetal therapy, none of the 
drugs used has ever been eva luated for their effects on the mother and her child in a Randomized Clinical  Trial 
(RCT). In the absence of such evidence, there is no consensus for the optimal manag ement. The Fetal Atrial 
Flutter and Supraventricular Tachycardia ( FAST) Therapy Trial is a prospective multi -centere d trial that 
address es this knowledge gap to guide future fetal SVA therapy to the best of care.  
Study components of the FAST Therapy  Trial include:  
 Three prospective RCT  sub-studies  (FAST RCT)  to determine the efficacy and safety of specific 
transplacental drug regimens in suppressing fetal AF without hydrops, SVT without hydrops, and SVT with 
hydrops . Additional information  on the RCT sub -studies is available at ClinicalTrials.gov under listing 
#[STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  Participation in the regulated FAS T RCTs is currently restricted to pre -selected centers.   
 
A prospective observational cohort study (FAST Registry)  is a non-regulated Registry  which seeks to establish 
an international database of fetal SVA management done to date , to be used to  publish i nformation on the results 
of current prenatal care and to evaluate  the need for additional  FAST RCTs . Participation in FAST Registry 
requires site REB approval and an executed legal contract with the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31331], Toronto  (REB 
Number#  [PHONE_13342]) .  
  
This protocol applies to centers that are participating  in the RCT sub -studies.  
The primary outcome  of the FAST  RCT  will be the proportion of term deliveries  of live -born child ren with a 
normal cardiac rhythm. Term delivery is defined as bi rth 37 0/[ADDRESS_858407] common cause  of fetal tachycardia  ≥[ADDRESS_858408] ing 
1/4,000 pregnancies.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_641418], i t is a leading  cause of fetal heart failur e, prematurity and 
perinatal death . The development of fetal hydrops  (defined by  >1 of these symptoms: abdominal, pleural,  
pericardial effusion (s); skin edema ) is associated with perinatal mortality  as high as 35% . The risk of hydrops 
increases if SVA  presents at a younger gestational age and is rapid and enduring, but even intermittent SVA  may

fetuses with SVT presented with hydrops, which was associated with a perinatal mortality rate of 21%.1 In 
another study by [CONTACT_386671] , fetal hydrops occurred in 41% of 127 SVA cases and was associated with 27% 
mortality.5 In the a bsence of fetal hydrops, the risk of SVA -related perinatal mortality is much lower (0% -4%).1, [ADDRESS_858410] commonly  associated with 2:[ADDRESS_858411]  always  <300 bpm. Fetal SVT itself is 
produced by 3 main mechanisms: 1) AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), involving the AV node for antegrade 
(AV) conduction and a fast retrograde (VA) conducting accessory pathway; 2) permanent junctional reciprocating 
tachycardia (PJRT) , like AVRT but with slow retrograde pathway conduction; and 3) atrial ectopic tachycardia 
(AET) due to an atrial focus with enhanced automaticity. The differentiation of AVRT , PJRT  or AET by [CONTACT_641447] n ot be required for the RCT sinc e there is no evidence that it a ffects the

of increased  risks of maternal and fetal adverse events (AE s).5-9, 18-31  Detailed descriptions o f drug a ctions and 
possible AEs related to the use  of the study drugs are provided in the Monographs . In brief:  
 DIGOXIN  actions include parasympathetic slowing of sinus node and prolongation of the AV nodal 
refractoriness. In the absence of hydrops, o ral digoxin is well absorbed and  transferred to the fetus , to reach 
fetal serum concentrations that are close to those in ma ternal serum (F/M ratio 0.8 -1) within 3 -5 days.2 No 
serious AE s (SAE s) have  been reported , but nausea, anorexia, headache, visual disturbances and dizziness  are 
among the more common patient complaint s.1   
 
 FLECAINIDE  inhibits Na+ channels, slowing conduction and increasing refractoriness of all cardiac tissues. 
Flecainide is well -absorbed and transferred to the fetus to reach therapeutic levels within 3 days (F/M ratio 
0.7-0.9).2, 32 At maternal  serum concentrations >1 mcg/ml,  the QRS interval may prolong and the risk of 
proarrhythmia increase. Infrequent m aternal  AEs include blurred vision, nausea, constip ation, dizziness, and 
headache . Maternal  SAEs have not  been reported  but there is one case of unexplained in-utero demise  of a 
non-hydropic fetus 23 years ago.6 
 
 SOTALOL  is both an iKr channel and β -blocker, with β -blockade as the main effect at doses <160 mg/day. The 
combined effects decrease heart  rate, and prolong action potential duration  and tissue refractoriness throughout 
the heart.33, 34 Sotalol is well  absorbed  and transferred to reach a fetal steady state level similar to maternal 
plasma level (F/M ratio 0.7-2.1).2, [ADDRESS_858415] not been

system at faster rates. Sotalol  delays AV nodal conduction and pr olongs the refractory period to electrical 
stimulation of the myocardial and conduction tissues. Suppression of arrhythmias confined to atrial tissue (AET; 
AF) is possible by [CONTACT_641451]. Digoxin has probably no such direct 
effects on  atrial cells but slows tachycardia rates, owing to improved ventricular filling with lower atrial pressure 
and distension. The hemodynamic changes  may alter electr ical tissue properties and indirectly suppress AF.[ADDRESS_858418] line agents in 
treating fetal SVA.2 In studies (total n=226) using oral digoxin  monotherapy , in-utero cardioversion has been 
reported in 50% to 100% of SVA without  hydrops, but in <20% of SVA with hydrops.5, 8, 9, 18, 24, 30 Flecainide 
(n=70) has resulted in sinus rhythm in 58% to 100% of SVA cases without  hydrops and in 43% to 58% of those 
with hydrops.6, 18, 24, 26, 29, 31 Sotalol (n=56) has be en successful in 40% to 100% of SVA  without  hydrops , and in 
50% with hydrops.21, 22, [ADDRESS_858419] line agent .1 An 
adverse primary outcome, defined as a) preterm delivery, b) perinatal death, or c) persistent SVA to birth , was 
documented in 45% of 75 treated SVT cases (outcome a) 32%; b) 8%; c) 5%) and 58% of 36 treated AF cases (a) 
50%; b) 3%; c) 6%), and was mainly related to incomplete SVA control at the time of the event . However, Jaeggi’s 
study also demonstrated that the fetal response to treatment independently depended on the SVA pattern , fetal 
state  and the choice of 1st line therapy . AF [Fig. 1 ] and fetal hydrops [ Fig. 2 ] were independently associated with

diagnosis. It took more than twice as long (9 vs. 4 
days) for conversion of 50% of SVT cases to a 
normal rhythm if fetuses were hydropic. 21% of the 
hydropic cases died.

  Version Date: July 7, [ADDRESS_858420] line mon otherapy with sotalol resulted in faster/higher AF 
termination rates [ Fig. 3 ] while flecainide or digoxin was superior in terminating SVT [ Fig. 4 ] and in lowering 
tachycardia rates if SVA persisted [ Fig. 5 ].  None of the agents as 2nd line therapy was asso ciated with a greater 
rate of SVA termination although sotalol tended to be superior for AF. Once fetal SVA was converted to sinus 
rhythm, chronic drug therapy to birth with the drug(s) that successfully terminated the SVA was used to prevent 
recurrences. Recurrence of SVT and AF was documented in 8% and 15% of cases during the first month of 
maintenance treatment.1

(n=75): For patients with SVT, in multivariate models 
adjusted for hydrops and SVT pattern, the use of 
flecainide  (HR:  2.9; p=0.01) or digoxin (HR: 2.1; 
p=0.02) as 1st therapy were associated with increased 
likelihood of SVT termination compared to sotalol. The  
median time to conversion of 50% of cases was 3 days 
with digoxin, 4 days with flecainide but 12 days with 
sotal ol. Fig. 3.  Freedom from termination of fetal AF 
(n=36): For patients with AF, in multivariate models 
adjusted for arrhythmia pattern, 1st line sotalol  was 
associated with a greater likelihood of AF termination 
compared with digoxin (HR: 5.4; p=0.05) or flecainide 
(HR: 7.4; p=0.03). Time to conversion of 50% was [ADDRESS_858421] line treatment on tachycardia 
rates.  When incessant SVT (n=23) or AF (n=22) 
persisted to day 5  of treatment, ventricular rates were 
lowered more with flecainide and digoxin than with 
sotalol  (p<0.001). This suggests that flecainide and 
digoxin are similarly effective in reducing the 
tachycardia to better tolerated rates while sotalol has no 
or only  modest heart rate slowing effects.

outcome of the pregnancy significantly depend on  any of these three variables:  
 The underlying SVA mechanism  (AF vs. SVT)   
 The fetal state  (fetal hydrops  vs. non -hydrops ), and 
 The primary choice of antiarrhythmic therapy  
The optimal choice of therapy at the time of a new SVA diagnosis is of critical importance as it is the only 
variable  that may be  directly influenced by [CONTACT_1963] ’s decisions . 
While the study by [CONTACT_641452], several limitations inherent to the retrospective study design may 
limit the validity of some study findings. This includes : a) relatively small case numbers due to the relative rarity 
of SVA (111 treated cases; 3 therapy arms); b) differences in disease severity among patient cohorts; and c) 
insufficient data to address AEs and 2nd line therapy. One important study conclusion none theless was that 1st line 
therapy initiation with only one antiarrhythmic is probably safe unless fetal heart failure is present  (21% perinatal 
mortality), leading to this proposal to start with single drug therapy in the absence of hydrops  (RCT Sub-study  A 
and B)  and dual therapy with hydrops  (RCT Sub-study  C). This approach is also supported by [CONTACT_641453].[ADDRESS_858422] the potential to 
provoke new or to exacerbate existing arrhythmias. This  risk increases with toxic drug levels, maternal heart 
disease, ventricular arrhythmia, and hypokalemia .39-41 Previously reported mortality rates of treated fetuses with 
SVA without  hydrops were between 0% and 5%, whereas about 20% of fetuse s with SVA with hydrops had died, 
usually due to treatment -resistant SVA.2, 5 In our large experience, we never observed unexpected SAEs, 
irrespective whether single or multiple drug therapy was used.1 
To minimize risks of SAE s a) only mothers without serious health and pregnancy concerns other than fetal  SVA 
are eligible for participation in the RCTs (see Section 7.2); b) the primary physician and pa rticipant  both are 
informed about the assigned drug therapy from the time of randomization to study end (open label trial); c) drug 
dosages will be used that are considered to be safe and effective (see 7.6), thus avoiding toxic levels (digoxin) and 
excessive QTc prolongation >0.5 (sotalol); and d) initiation of therapy is recommended in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_641424]/fetal heart rates and wellbeing, followed by [CONTACT_641454] (see 7.7).

  Version Date: July 7, [ADDRESS_858423] Therapy Trial , we conducted two large surveys.  
In Survey I , of which 87 tertiary maternal -fetal (47%) and fetal cardiology (61%) sites replied, we determined:   
a) caregivers responsible for the management of fetal SVA at each site; b) avera ge number s of treated cases/year 
and site; c) the willingness to participate in a prospective RCT (94% support) and/or a prospective registry (90% 
support ); d) current 1st line drug choices [ Fig. 6 ] and e) drug preferences f or hypothetical RCTs  [Fig. 7 ]. 
In Survey II , we obtained (89 potential study sites , 23 countries ): a) numbers of treated SVA cases based on 
institutional reviews of 2011 -2012 [Fig. 8 ], b) expected maternal consent/recruitment rates at each center (mean: 
81%), and assessed c) participation rates in the AF/no hydrops RCT (n=75; 86%), SVT/no hydrops RCT (n=76; 
87%), SVT/hydrops RCT (n=78; 90%), and/or the registry (n=69; 79%) . Of [ADDRESS_858424], three RCTs were elected by 66 (76%), 2 RCTs by 12 (14%), and  [ADDRESS_858425] by 7 (8%) centers. We

treat SVT and AF without hydrops. If there was fetal 
hydrops, flecainide for SVT and sotalol for AF were 
slightly preferred over digoxin. Less than 20% currently

hydrops).1 Survey II suggests that an average of 2.3 SVT/no hydrops, 1.21 AF/no hydrops and 1.03 treated 
SVT/hydrops cases/year/center will be eligible for RCT enrolment, with average consent rates of 81%. Sample 
size calculation for 2 -arm treatment comparisons was performed using PASS (Power and Sample Size) v12 
(NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003]). To calculate sample size requirements for this study we expected the 
proporti on of patients with normal pri mary outcome to be 55% with SVT without hydrops, 30% with AF without 
hydrops, and 30% of SVT with hydrops with the inferior treatment arm (i.e. the null hypothesis). We aim to detect 
an improvement of +20% in the proportion of  patients with a normal primary outcome with the super ior RCT arm 
(i.e. 75% for SVT without hydrops; 50% for AF without hydrops and SVT with hydrops; i.e. the alternative 
hypothesis). The test statistic used is the two -sided Likelihood Ratio test which is equivalent to the Wald chi -
square for logistic regression models which will be used to analyze our primary outcome. The significance level 
of the test of significance was targeted at 0.05, with a power of 80%. Assuming those  metrics, we will need  [ADDRESS_858430] participants , with a minimum number of patients in each of the three RCTs of:  
AF without hydrops  (RCT A) :  186 (93/arm) treated cases ← 232 approached cases with 80% consent rate  
SVT without  hydrops  (RCT B) : 178 (89/arm) treated cases ← 222 approached cases with 80% consent rate  
SVT with hydrops  (RCT C) :    186 (93/arm) treated cases ← 232 approached cases with 80% consent rate  
 
With 50 average sized sites , we anticipate 225 treated patients/year (mean: 4.5) to be approached during the study 
period which should be sufficient to recruit the required number of patients with SVT without  hydrops (RCT B) in 
1.9 years, AF without  hydrops (RCT A) in 3.8 years and SVT without hydrops (RCT C) in 4.[ADDRESS_858431] (0.27 cases/year and site). Study completion

and conducting the study at the participating center. There is no data on consent rates for a prospective fetal SVA 
trial. Survey II suggests average consent rates of 81%. Consent rates are available from other fetal -maternal

4.2 RANDOMIZED TRIAL . (See [ADDRESS_858440] details ). The FAST  RCT Sub-studies  A, B and C are open label 
phase III  trials of standard 1st line therapy, which either is started as monotherapy (no hydrops) or as dual therapy 
(hydrops).  To participate as a patient in an RCT  sub-study , all maternal and fetal inclusion  criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria must be fulfilled (see below). D ifferentiation between “AF vs. SVT” and “hydrops vs. non -
hydrops” is required  for randomization into the appropri ate sub -study  (Fig. 9) . The site investigator will be 
responsible for diagnosis , eligibility assessment and randomization  in the appropriate RCT arm.  Each participant 
will be assigned a unique study identifier to protect privacy and to be used for communic ation with the site 
investigator.  The Echo Core Lab at SickKids will review  as soon as possible, but not prior to randomization or 
treatment initiation , all uploaded baseline data and will ensure d iagnostic accuracy by  [CONTACT_641455]-identified  Three prospective RCT sub -studies  to determine the 
efficacy and safety of specific transplacental drug 
regimens in suppressing: A) fetal AF without  hydrops

started on 1st line therapy, t he treating physician  will at any time be free to modify and/or change treatment  for the 
remainder of gestation . Patient care maps for the different treatment arms are provided that may help and be used 
to guide most perinatal management decisions to birth . Maternal questionnaire and , if applicable,  case report 
forms (CRFs) will be used  to assess for maternal and fetal AEs  and specified outcomes (5.2.1)  at each participant  
encounter .  
With  50 centers and 80% consent rates per RCT, actual study periods are expected to take 1.9 years ( RCT B: SVT 
without  hydrops ), 3.8 years ( RCT A: AF without  hydrops ), and 4.4 years ( RCT C:  SVT with hydrops ), 
respectively. This will allow postnatal follow-up to a minimum of [ADDRESS_858441] sub -studies will be competitive and once a predetermined number of participant s are 
enrolled, new patients will be considered for the registry only.  
4.3 REGISTRY . Registry data will be used to determine the outcome of the non -randomized  (treated),  and 
untreated SVA study population to examine the impact and outcome of alternative treatment approaches.  This 
includes fetal AF with hydrops , which is not studied by a separate RCT due to the rarity of the association . 
4.[ADDRESS_858442]’s withdrawal from the study (if 
given) will be documented in the Study Completion/Exit F orm.  If the subject withdraws, data that has already 
been coll ected up to that point in time will be kept (as indicated in the patient informed consent).  
4.5 PARTICIPANT  REPLACEMENT . Study p articipants withdraw ing from  the trial will be replaced 1:[ADDRESS_858443]  but elects to not participate  the

and hypokalemia .  
Procedures for study participants to minimize the risk of SAEs include:  
 only mothers without serious health and pregnancy concerns other than fetal SVA are el igible for 
participation in RCT  sub-studies  (see 7);  
 the primary physician and pa rticipant  both are informed about the assigned drug therapy from the time of 
randomizati on to study end (open label trial);  
 drug dosages will be used that are considered to be safe and effective, thus avoiding toxic levels (digoxin) 
and excessive QTc prolongation >0.5 (sotalol);  d) concomitant medication (7.6.2) that  may interact with a 
study drug are not to be used or, if no alternative exists, used with caution during the trial;  and

This is accomplished by [CONTACT_641458].  
Adverse Event (AE) : is defined as any untoward medical occurrence of a symp tom that may or may not  
have a causal relationship with the treatment used.  Examples include a rash noted during a physica l exam, 
abnormal lab results, or a change from a baseline condition.  
Failure of the drug does not constitute an AE. Sources of information will include observation (physical exam; 
ECG; echo; lab result), patient statement, patient charts, and serial assessment at each encounter by [CONTACT_641459] (↑ severity/frequency of pre -existing symptom(s)) or new AEs ).  
It will be the responsibility of the primary physician to identify , and to classify the seriousness, severity , causality 
and expectedness of an AE  as follow s:  
a) Assessment if event qualifies as serious : 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) : A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening , 
 Requires inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity   
 Results in congenital ab normalities or birth defect

Mild  Events are considered MILD if s igns/symptoms are mild, clinical relevance is marginal, 
laboratory findings are asymptomatic and  no specific medical intervention is required.   
Moderate  Events are considered MODERATE if they r equir e minimal, local, or non -invasive 
intervention only . 
Severe Events are considered SEVERE if they  interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities 
and generally require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually 
incapacitating.  
 
c) Causa lity assessment : 
Definitely related  There is a certainty that the event is related to the study drug(s).  
Probably related  There is high likelihood that the event is related to the study drug(s).  
Possibly related  There is a likelihood that the study drug (s) is the cause of the event, but other causes 
cannot be ruled out.  
Unlikely related  It is not likely that the event is related to the study drug(s), and other more likely causes 
are present.  
Unrelated   Evidence exists that the event is related to something other than a study drug.  
 
d) Expectedness assessment : 
An event is considered unexpected if the nature, severity or frequency is not  consistent with the risk 
information listed in the Product Monograp h. 
Pregnancy - and treatment -related AEs will be documented by [CONTACT_6962]. Prior  to the start of drug 
therapy ( pretreatment forms ), a thorough medical history should be obtained to document all preexisting maternal 
symptoms, complaints and health  concerns.  As many pregnancy related symptoms are intermittent in nature, a 
thorough history including variations in severity and frequency should be taken. AEs should be reassessed at each 
participant  encounter. If signs or symptoms remain similar to base line or are less in severity, frequency, or both, 
they will be considered within the usual range and do not need to be documented as AEs. In contrast, signs and 
symptoms that are new or, if preexisting, are more frequent/severe, need to be documented, asse ssed for severity 
and causality, and followed up until resolution.

the randomization into the appropriate sub -study. SickKids will function as the Echo Core Lab Facility to review 
patient diagnosis and fetal state to determine if  the initiated drug therapy is appropriate . The Core Lab provides 
support to ensure accurate diagnosis and classification and if requested will provide a review of findings within [ADDRESS_858459] line therapy arms, which either will be started as 
monotherapy ( AF or SVT without hydrop s) or as dual therapy ( SVT with hydrops) . First line drug therapy is pre-
defined including the initial  dose and mode of administration :

IV DIGOXIN : additional recommendations  
For RCT A, B or C Digoxin can be  administered as oral tablets or IV. For IV the Digoxin Injection can be 
administered undiluted or diluted with a 4 -fold or greater volume of 0.9% NaCl injection, or 5% Dextrose 
Injection. The use of less than a [ADDRESS_858464] is recommended. Slow infusion of digoxin over a period of 5 
minutes or longer is preferable to bolus administration. Rapid infusion of digitalis glycosides has been 
shown to cause systemic and c oronary arteriolar constriction, which may be clinically undesirable. 
Mixing of intravenous digoxin with other drugs in the same container or simultaneous administration in 
the same intravenous line is not recommended.  
7.6.1  CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ONS  
Medication to be avoided d uring trial participat ion or, if no alternative exists , used with caution  and appropriate 
monitoring of the QTc, include medications that prolong QT and/or increase risk for Torsades de Pointes (TDP) 
(List available online at:  https://crediblemeds.org/healthcare -providers/ ). Concomitant medication use of 
pentamidine is to be avoided and additional anti -arrhythmics to be used with caution.  See relevant drug

monitoring to birth by [CONTACT_099] (usually by [CONTACT_641472]) and the mother (by [CONTACT_641473]) is recommended  to detect SVA recurrences and to allow treatment adjustments, as required.

thera peutic fetal drug levels  with transplacental medication . A premature change to 2nd line therapy prior to 3 -7 
days of therapy is therefore not advised unless t here is significant worsening of  the fetal state (e.g. new hydrops) , 
the SVA pattern (>20% increase in SVA rates and duration) , or both . Members of the FAST Trial steering 
committe e have developed consensus -based recommendations  [Care Maps] to adjust the prenatal 
pharmaco therapy to the most common treatment outcomes and clinical scenarios , e.g. if 1st, 2nd or 3rd line 
treatment appears ineffective . Care Map  recommendations may include: a) no change in therapy (sinus rhythm; ↓ 
SVA <10% of time); b) escalation of drug dose (some S VA response); or c) addition of or change to different 
medication (no SVA response). The responsible physician is free to follow the recommendations or to elect 
treatment that differs from the Care Map.  Cross over  to a different medication , fetal demise, preterm delivery , and 
SVA that persists to birth will be considered as 1st line treatment failure . Removal of an agent from treatment 
following sustained conversion to a normal rhythm  (treatment success) does not constitute treatment failure.  
Following sustained conversion to a normal rhythm of at least 24 hours ( acute 1st line treatment success ), it is 
recommended to not change the successful treatment until birth if the treatment is tolerated  and the SVA does not 
recur . Any new documentation of fetal SVA on maintenance therapy that is confirmed by [CONTACT_641475] g during labor  will be considered as maintenance treatment failure . Near -complete 
suppression of SVA does usually not require a change in maintenance therapy. Maternal drug therapy will be 
maintained until time of delivery and discontinued immediately ther eafter. The choice of postnatal neonatal drug 
therapy  will be at the discretion o f the primary physician. Postnatal  outcomes will be assessed to a minimum of [ADDRESS_858467]  sub-studies  requires procedures that

adherence with national regulatory guidelines . There may be bri ef periods of time when 1st line medication will be 
dispensed from an alternative clinical supply such as during labour and delivery. If this occurs it will be 
documented but not r ecorded as a protocol deviation, however  attempt s should be made to obtain i nformation 
regarding the lot number and manufacturer. All responsibility for study medication, packaging and labeling is 
delegated to the Site Investigator as outlined in the Study Agreement. As this is a study of 1st line treatment 
only,once the pa rticipa nt changes therapy to  second line medication  the medication will be supplied from clinical 
supply and documentation of accountability will no longer be applicable.  
ACCOUNTABLITY.   An accurate and current accounting of the dispensing and return of study drug for each 
subject will be maintained on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_641476] P roduct  Accountability L og kept by [CONTACT_42737].  The amount  of study drug dispensed and re turned b y the subject will be recorded i n this  log.  The 
responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_641439] . This Accountability 
Log is only required for 1st line study medication for the RCTs.  
COMPLIANCE AND ADHER ENCE.  Most mothers with fetal SVA understand the importance of regular drug 
intake to improve the chances of a normal pregnancy outcome and non -compliance is highly unusual. 
None theless, participant  compliance should  be assessed at each visit ( for 1st line study medication ) by [CONTACT_641477].  Adherence rate to treatment since last visit will be calculated as 
percentage of the prescribed medication that has been taken by [CONTACT_641478].  In the event 
that the mother is admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_641440], self-reporting of dosage will be taken into  accou nt when determining 
adherence. Non-compliance may be  suspected if the adhere nce rate is <80%, is self -reported , digoxin level tests 
turn out too low or is negative, among others.   
 
7.[ADDRESS_858468] CENTERS & DURATION . Requirements of a study site to be considered eligible to participate in the FAST 
Therapy RCT include :  
 The centre  provide s the primary care of RCT participants from the time of SVA diagnosis to birth  or death.   
 Neonatal and maternal outcomes t o 30 days  after birth  is ascertained . 
 The site investigator/site  have the experience , the commitment , and the infrastructure to successfully conduct 
this research .  
 REB approval has been  obtained including,  if applicable, for affiliated institutions.  
 Regulatory approval has been  obtained by [CONTACT_641479] , if applicable, the  national  coordinating center .  
 Contracts (data share, legal and financial agreements)  have been finalized .          
With an anticipated  50 average sized centers and 80% consent rates per RCT, actual study periods are expected to 
take 1.9 years (SVT without hydrops), 3.8 years (AF  without  hydrops ), and 4.4 years (SVT with hydrops), 
respectively. This will allow follow -up to 30 days after birth  of corrected age of all study participants. Study

significant differences in various outcomes among drug regimens based on our preliminary work.1  
PRIMARY OUTCOME   
 Term delivery (≥37 0/7 weeks gestation ) with a normal cardiac rhythm  (ECG) . 
SECONDARY OUTCOME  
 Proportion of pa rticipant s with cardioversion over time  
 Proportion of pa rticipants  with treatment failure  
- Number of participants with treatment failure compared to number of par ticipants with successful treatment. 
Treament failure is defined as one of the following:  
1. cross-over to another drug  
2. SVT/AF that persists to birth  
3. preterm birth  
4. death  
 Cause of death ( prenatal, postnatal ) 
 Proportion of participants with arrhythmia related death  
 Average gestational age at birth  
 Birth weight (z-scores ) 
 Average days of maternal and neonatal hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_641441]  
 Maternal prevalence of pregnancy/treatment -related AEs and outcomes  
 Proportion of AEs / adverse outcomes ( prenatal, postnatal ) 
The primary outcome measure is  absolute (term delivery without tachyarrhythmia) with no room for 
interpretation. Secondary outcomes will be the time interval from treatment initiation to the beginning of 
permanent cardioversion, and once established, the freedom from SVA recurrence on maintenance therapy. Only 
the final outcome will be considered to classify cases. Cross -over to another agent, fetal demise, development of 
fetal hydrops, and delivery for SVA will be considered treatment failures. Any recurrence of fetal SVA after

7.11  STATISTICAL ANALYSES . All statistical analyses using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary NC) with standard settings 
will be performed by [CONTACT_641481] e xperienced statistician  from the Cardiovascular Data Management Centre  (CVDMC ) 
at SickKids. As a general precept, all [ADDRESS_858474] deviation, median 
with inter -quartile range , and frequencies as appropriate . Baseline characteristics that should be equally 
distributed between groups th rough randomization ( age at diagnosis, baseline fetal heart rate, incessant vs. 
intermittent SVA , maternal  age) will be assessed in a test of randomization. The test of randomization will be 
performed using Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and Student’s t -test (with Satterthwaite method for 
variance estimat ion) for continuous variables.  
The PRIMARY OU TCOME  (proportion of term deliveries without SV A) will be a binary outcome (yes/no). For 
this type of outcome, the proportion of pa rticipant s in each therapy arm will be compared using logistic regression 
models (PROC LOGISTIC ) with likelihood ratio test t o determine regression model fit, Wald chi -square test from 
maximum likelihood estimates (Fisher’s scoring technique) to determine statistical significance of the therapy arm 
and c -statistic from the regression model’s area under the curve (AUC) to measure  model accuracy. Effect size 
estimate and standard error will be converted into odds ratio with 95% confidence (95% CI) limits to facilitate 
comparisons between the different trials.  
SECONDARY OUTCOME will also be  expressed as binary variables (incl. prop ortions of pa rticipant s: 
requiring 2nd line therapy  and 3rd line therapy; with SVA recurrence on maintenance therapy ; delivery without 
SVA termination ; death <1 month ; etc.) will be assessed between the different therapy arms in the same way as 
the primary  outcome. For outcome s with time dependent variables ( proportion of participant s with cardioversion 
over time ; timing of mortality from initiation of therapy ), Kaplan -Meier survival curves will be used to depi[INVESTIGATOR_641442]. Single phase parametric hazard regression model (PROC PHREG) will 
be used to compare the 2 therapy arms (with likelihood ratio test to determine regression m odel fit and maximum 
likelihood estimates chi -square to determine statistical significance of the therapy arm. Effect size estimate and 
standard error will be converted into hazard ratio with 95% CI to facilitate comparisons between the different 
trials.  Finally, for outcomes with continuous variables ( average gestational age at birth /birth weight z -score ; 
average days of neonatal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_641441] ), linear regression models using maximum 
likelihood estimates for parameter estimation will be used (PROC GENMOD : Akaike's information criterion 
(AIC) criterion to assess regression model fit ; Wald chi -square test from maximum likelihood estimates ). Effect 
size estimate and standard error will determine the difference between the therapy arms in the same original units 
of measurement as the outcome.  
SUB -ANALYSIS will attempt to determine the factors associated w ith successful RCT outcomes. T o accomplish 
this, we will use our primary outcome as the dependent variable. Fetal factors (age at diagn osis) , SVA 
characteristics (heart rate; arrhythmia pattern; SVT subtype s) and treatment metrics (agent(s); dose) will be 
considered as potential independent variables. In a first , all variables will be evaluated separately in univariable

in a bootstrap bagging algorithm (500 random resamples) . Those variables with high reliability (selected in >50% 
of the random resamples) will be included in a  multivariable logistic regression model (PROC LOGISTIC ) with 
likelihood ratio test to determine regression model fit, Wald chi -square test from maximum likelihood estimates 
(Fisher’s scoring technique) to determine statistical significance of the therapy arm and c -statistic from the 
regression model’s area under the curve (AUC) to measure model accuracy with backward selection of variable 
(p<0.05 to enter ) to obtain a final model. Effect size estimate and standard error will be converted into odds ratio 
with 95% CI to facilitate comparisons of effect size between the different covariates. This final model would 
indicate factors associated with greater odds of positive outcome and, providing that analog results are fo und 
between the effects of 1st line therapy between the 2 models (primary RCT analysis as above and sub -analysis).  
FREQUENCY OF ANALYSIS . Pre-specified interim a nalyse s of the 3 strata will be performed separately at 
50% of enrol ment. Each analysis will focus on the primary outcome and safet y report including review of 
between -groups differences and ind ividual review of AEs , other maternal, fetal and infant outcomes,  and other 
safety concerns, if any. All interim analyses will be blinded (with potential un -blinding at the request of the 
DSMB ) as to not influence the final analysis.  
SUBGROUP ANALYSIS . Additional subgroup analyses will includ e comparisons with registry pa rticipant s and 
impact of tachycardia rates : 1) cardioversion rates over time of RCT  participant s with SVT  and AF + hydrops ; 
and 2) tachycardia  rates of ca ses with persistent SVA at ±1 week  of acute therapy  (all arms ).[ADDRESS_858475] Therapy Trial  Team as ou tlined in our Integrated Quality and Risk Management Plan (IQRMP) . The Trial 
Monitor  will verify that RCTs are  conducted and data is generated, documented and reported in compliance with 
the protocol s, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements.  REDCap files will be monitored regularly by [CONTACT_641482].  Safety and 
accuracy of all equipment used in  this study, such as ultrasound , ECG,  and BP systems,  is the responsibility of the  
study site /department where the equipment is clinically used. A ll equipment must be properly calibrated and 
maintained throughout the trial  in accordance with the institution’s regulations .  
ETHIC S.  RCT investigators will ensure that this trial is conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki , and that the  trial is conducted in full conformity with re levant regulations and with

1.1
 Adoptive cellular immunotherapy  
O
ne approach of addressing immune deficiencies preventing an antitumor response in vivo 
effectively applied to improve survival  is to infuse immune cells activated ex vivo . Sipuleucel -
T, an autologous cellular immunotherapy, has been approved for  the treatment of metastatic 
prostate cancer  [1]. Sipuleucel -T is manufactured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) isolated during leukapheresis that are cultured ex vivo with PA2024, a fusion 
protein consisting of prostatic acid phosphatase and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, and then infused back into the patient. O ther strategies  of activating , 
expanding, and/or engineer ing immune cells ex vivo  to mediate antitumor  effects  have  
exhibited considerable promise in a variety of malignancies  [2,3]. Cellular immunotherapy 
has not been reproducibly effective, and several obstacles remain, including sustaining the 
in vivo survival and function of transferred cells  and generating high-avidity tumor -reactive T 
cells. T-cell persistence can be transiently maintained by [CONTACT_672040] (IL -) 2, 
but this is often associated with significant toxicity and may also promote expansion of regulatory T (Treg) cell s that limit antitumor immunity  [4]. The poor T-cell function often 
observ ed has been more difficult to address, as it, in part, reflects deficient expression of 
costimulatory proteins and/or increased expression of inhibitory ligands or suppressive cytokines by [CONTACT_20405]  [5]. Thus, strategies to improve T cell survival, function, and avidity 
are needed.  
C
ell processing is performed per FDA approved SOPs.  They include several tests of 
sterility.  
1.2
 Cbl-b 
Cb
l-b (Casitas B -lineage lymphoma b), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a major negative regulator 
of lymphocyte function. It increases the threshold for naive T-cell activation by [CONTACT_52361] 
T-cell receptor  and CD28 costimulatory signaling [6]. Abrogating Cbl -b expression rescues
IL-2 production and proliferation by [CONTACT_672041]28–/– T cells . Following target recognition,
interferon (IFN-) γ production is enhanced, and  target avidity is increased. Importantly ,
nei
ther proliferation or cytokine production is induced in unstimulated T cells , indicati ng that
Cb
l-b silencing enhances T cell activities only in the context of antigen stimulation and does
not lead to an unwanted general activation of all lymphocytes. Tumors lack the costimulatoryproteins that bind CD28, and CD28 expression is often lost on T cells that hav
e
di
fferentiated to effector cells during repetitive stimulations  [7]. Thus, disrupting Cbl -b
ex
pression in tumor -reactive T cells may provide a unique strategy for increasing autocri ne
IL
-2 production for promoting proliferative responses and survival following tumor
recognition in the absence of costimulation and may also reduce the threshold for T cell
activation to allow low -avidity T cells to respond to tumors expressing limiting amounts  of
anti
gen. Cbl-b–/– knock-out mice are resistant to outgrowth of transplantabl e and
s
pontaneous tumors  [8,9]. Adoptive transfer of Cbl -b–/– CD8+ T cells into tumor-bearing wild-
type mice resulted in detectable therapeutic activity [9-11]. Tumor resistance has been
attributed to the increased responsiveness of the small number of naive tumor -reactiv e
Cb
l-b–/– CD8+ T cells present in the polyclonal repertoire. G enetic deletion of Cbl -b or
targeted inactivation of its E3 ligase activity also have  been shown to license natural killer
(NK) cells to spontaneously reject metastatic tumors in mouse models  [12]. Cellular
immunotherapy with Cbl -b–/– cells or inactivation of Cbl -b E3 ligase activity  does not result i n

the siRNA with minimal cell damage. Using this protocol shut down of Cbl-b expression can 
be achieved for more than seven days in stimulated human T cells, resulting in strong 
enhancement of T-cell activation, cytokine production, and proliferation. Cbl-b-silenced 
PBMCs display a clear increase in proliferation and IL-2 and IFN -γ production in response to 
anti-CD3/28 stimul ation. In addition, Cbl -b silencing also increases secretion of tumor 
necrosis factor ( TNF) α and IL-17. Adoptive transfer of Cbl -b silenced murine CD8 T cells 
using a similar transient siRNA silencing procedure as for human cells significantly 
decreased tumor burden [13]. Moreover, T cells isolated from tumor-draining lymph nodes 
displayed sustained activated T cell function five  days after Cbl-b silencing and transfer. 
Little toxicity was observed. No unwanted effects of autoimmunity in other tissues were observed. Thus, APN401 is a novel approach to enhance antitumor immune responses. 
Moreover, because of potential of limited toxicity and synergy with other cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_89149] a mechanistic component of immune activation, APN401 has high potential to be included in combination programs. 
1.4
 Phase 1 s tudy of s ingle infusion of APN401  
The feasibility and safety of a single intravenous infusion of APN401 were evaluated in 
patients with refractory m etastatic solid tumors  [14]. Patients with active autoimmune 
disease or a requirement for immune suppressive drugs were excluded. PBMC were collected by [CONTACT_74886]. The following day PBMCs were transfected with Cbl -b siRNA by 
[CONTACT_672042]401 and then infused intravenously over 30 minutes. Three to ten patients were treated in each of the three dosing cohorts  in which they received a 
single intravenous infusion of 5, 10, or 50 x10
5 cells/kg APN401. PBMC were successfully 
collected and transfected with Cbl -b siRNA in  all patients enrolled. CD3 T cell, CD56 NK 
cell, CD19 B cell, and CD14 monocytes were transfected with similar efficiencies. Transfected PBMCs produced 4-fold more IFN-γ 2-fold more IL-2 in response to CD3/CD28 
stimulation than PBMC that were processed and electroporated without siRNA. From 27.[ADDRESS_908111] patients at the completion of the infusion. Dose-limiting 
toxicities were not observed. There was no immediate hypersensitivity and no evidence of 
autoimmune adverse effects. Stable disease observed in two patients with pancreatic cancer and one with colorectal cancer was associated with increases in PBMC responses to stimulation with CD3/CD8 and tumor-associated peptides.

 Clinical Response

 Definitions  
R
esponse and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee [JNCI  
92(3):205-216, 2000]. Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria. Note: l esions are either measurable or 
non-measurable using the criteria provided below. The term “evaluable” in reference to 
measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy. 
9.1.1 Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) 
as >20 mm with conventional techniques (PET, CT, MRI, x -ray) or as > [ADDRESS_908147] be recorded in millimeters  (or 
decimal fractions of centimeters). 
9.1.2
 Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_908148] scan), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non-measurable. 
9.1.3
 Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their 
suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_15078]). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218].  
9.1.4
 Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Non-target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the maximum numbers per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non- measurable lesions.  Measurements of 
these lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up.

s
pecific protocols.
• PET-
CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combi ned
PET-
CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIS T
m
easurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as par t of a
PET-
CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral
contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIS T
m
easurements and can be used interchangeable with conventional CT in accurately
measuring cancer lesion over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the C T
i
ntroduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or
serially perform ed.
•U
ltrasound (US).  When the primary endpoint of the study is objective respons e
ev
aluation, US should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however , a
pos
sible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes ,
s
ubcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules.  US might also be useful to confirm  the
c
omplete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_672046].
•E
ndoscopy, laparoscopy. The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor
evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated.  Their uses in this specificcontext require sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may onlybe available in some centers. Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for
objective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in referenc
e
c
enters. However, such techniques can be useful to confirm complete pathological
response when biopsies are obtained.

target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal
limits

N
ote: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression, even after discontinuation of treatment. In some circumstances, it may be difficult 
to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response 
depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status.  
9.4
 Confirmatory measurement/d uration of response  
9.4.1
 Confirmation: To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_672047]. In the case of 
SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after 
study entry at a minimum interval of eight weeks. 
9.4.2
 Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). The duration of overall CR is measured 
from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
9.4.3
 Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.

medians and ranges.  All tests of statistical significance will be 2-sided and p-values will 
generally not be adjusted for multiple comparisons. 
11.
4.1 Toxicity: APN401 will be considered tolerable if ≤1/6 or if overall ≤3/12 patients 
(i.e. an observed toxicity rate of at most 30%) experience grade 3-4 toxicity. With this design the likelihood of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_672032] ≤11.4% if the true grade 3-4 toxicity rate is ≤10% and >76.7% if it is >40%. The 
overall likelihood of declaring APN401 too toxic is ≤ 1.2% and >62%, respectively 
in these scenarios.

(SAE) Notification SOP   Date: 11/17/2016  
Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Requirements 
Th
is document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form that is submitted for 
unexpected grade 4 and any  grade 5 (death during protocol intervention ) SAEs on CCCWFU Institutional  
interventional trial patients . There are multiple entities that require reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different 
rules for what is reported, and how it is reported.  
Rul
es used by [CONTACT_39785] e ntities (Institutional Review Board (IRB), Ad EERS, MedWatch, etc.) should NOT be used to 
evaluate whether an event should be reported to STRC. Only the rules for reporting described in this document 
should be considered.  
As defined in the NCI Data Table 4  reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional  Interventional studies covered by 
[CONTACT_672053]: In -house, internally reviewed trials, including those collaborative 
studies conducted with industry sponsorship in which the center is a primary contributor to the design, 
implementation, and monitoring of the trial, or participation in a multi- site trial initiated by [CONTACT_672054].   Institutional trials are almost  always authored by a researcher here at CCCWFU. 
Institutional protocols are labeled NCI  Code=”I” for Institutional on the protocol screen in ORIS. Cooperative group 
protocols are not considered Institutional, but Research Base trials are classified as Institutional.  
Th
e STRC  is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional Interve ntional studies, as defined above. STRC 
currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these trials be reported to the STRC  for review. 
All Clinical Protocol and Data Management  (CPDM) staff members assisting a PI [INVESTIGATOR_672035] a clinical member of the STRC by [CONTACT_648]  (or in -
person) , followed by [CONTACT_399350].  
T
HESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any faculty or staff member on the study team for a CCCWFU 
Institutional Interventional trial. Once an event is observed, it is the responsibility of the person who observed 
the event to be sure that it is reported.  
What is considered an SAE under this mandat ory procedure ? 
Any unexpected grade 4 event and all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention) should be reported. 
These events should be reported if they occur while a patient is on study treatment or if they occur within [ADDRESS_908168] study tr eatment (even if patient begins a new treatment during the 30 days). This window of [ADDRESS_908169] that a shorter window can be used to identi fy events.  In addition, if it is not clear whether the Grade 4 is unexpected it 
should be reported.

the ORIS main menu page or by [CONTACT_672055]://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx . 
This will ensure that all persons that need to be made aware of the event (i.e., study team members and STRC 
members) will be notified; remember to file a copy of your  confirmation. (F orm instructions will walk you through 
the required fields, consult the help page for further instructions .) 
Ensure that you document that the appropriate person(s) on the STRC has been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].   This documentation is 
placed on the STRC Notification form described above.  
Follow up with/update the clinical member (s) of STRC regarding any new developments or information obtained

Definition of Unavailable:
As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contact[CONTACT_672056] a
reasonable amount of time, then initiate contact [CONTACT_399354].  Give the back-up a reasonable amount of time
to respond to a phone call or page before contact[CONTACT_485235]. This is a general guideline.  You must use
your best judgment as a clinical research professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and othercircumstances as to when it is appropriate to contact [CONTACT_380247].  If the event occurs near the end of day,
then leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting your STRC notification form.  The
important criteria is that you have taken reasonable steps to notify and document that you have initiated some
type of contact [CONTACT_672057].
STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events as they are reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and the members of STRC. The review will include 
but not be limited to the information reported; there may be times when additional information is needed in order for an assessment to be made  and further communi cation directly with the investigator may be warranted. STRC 
reserves the right to agree with the investigator’s assessment if STRC does not agree with the investigator. STRC 
reserves the right to suspend the trial pending further investigation.  
Is there a ny immediate danger or harm that could be present for a future patient based on the information 
provided in the STRC report – and if so an immediate suspension of enrollment should take place.  
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS REPORTS  
If you are not able to supply all pertinent information with the initial submission, once the additional information is 
available do not submit a new report . Go to the original email that was received by [CONTACT_399357] “reply to all” 
and entitle your email “ Amendment for (list date of event and patient ID) this will avoid duplications of the same 
event. List the additional information which you are reporting.

Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall respon se is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria (see section 
9.4.1).

for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started 
 
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of di sease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression, even after discontinuation of treatment. In some circumstances, it may be difficult 
to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response 
depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status.  
 
Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response 
 
Confirmation: To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_672058]. In the case o f SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD 
criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of eight weeks.  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The duration of 
overall C R is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first 
date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment started.

the patient’s Name, MRN, and DOB match the protocol collection orders.  
 
b. Labeling  
• Research Protocol Specific Label provided by [CONTACT_672061]:  ISBT [ADDRESS_908177] bag following 
completion of patient and protocol order verification; both CRN and VRN 
sign and date the ISBT [ADDRESS_908178] label(s) with a validated permanent marker.  
• CRN then exposes adhesive backing of label and securely applies ISBT 
[ADDRESS_908179] collection bag(s) is labeled in full view of patient and VRN, 
ensuring correct patient collection bag has been labeled 
c. Collecting  
• Collection is performed per research protocol orders. Collection via 
Spectra Optia Apheresis System

CCCWFU [ZIP_CODE]  
 
 
Protocol version date: 05/10/19                                                                Page 44 of 48     
 •  Collection performed with Optia IDL set using continuous mononuclear 
cell collection with whole blood processed with goal of 1.5 –  2.[ADDRESS_908180], collection rate 
of 1.0 ml/min.  
 
 
d. Chain of Custody  
• Research RN/coordinator is contact[CONTACT_672062].  
• Research RN/Coordinator coordinates the product retrieval time with [CONTACT_672069] or Research designee to ensure that they   are on the apheresis 
unit to retrieve the product from the apheresis RN immediately upon 
disconnection from Optia machine.  
• Study Principal Investigator (PI) is on unit to receive collected product and 
completes the cellular product hand off log signaling the end of the 
Apheresis  Unit chain of custody and the assumption of the Research 
Protocol for subsequent chain of custody procedure adherence. 
• The research personnel then remove the product from the apheresis unit 
as deemed appropriate by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Triozzi.  
  
ll. Minimum Processing Standards within a shared space 
BMT lab Requirements: 
o A meeting of all individuals including the requestors will be arranged to discuss 
each section of the BMT program’s involvement in the research project.  
o For BMT lab, discussion will include use of reage nts, solutions, equipment, 
space, storage, time, days of the week needed for product processing, training 
needed for the research techs.  
o Donors must be negative for infectious disease markers (IDMs)  
o Transfections with viral, bacterial or any infectious agents will not be allowed in 
the BMT lab- Changed to Transfection will be performed in an assigned biologic 
safety cabinet not currently in use by [CONTACT_672063]. 
o Researchers must have at least [ADDRESS_908181] label, patient label containing MRN/CSN numbers, 
and an alphanumeric number. BMT lab do not provide labels.  
o Any project study or IRB protocols will not be under our current BMT FDA 
registrations. If an FDA registration is needed, consult with BMT program and BMT lab directors. FDA registration should not be stated on the protocol without 
approval from the BMT program  
o Any equipment that is needed from BMT Processing Lab will require training 
and documentation of training including decontamination pr ocedures of the 
equipment. (Biologic safety cabinets, centrifuge, incubators, and controlled rate 
freezers).  
o Prevention of Cross -Contamination Guideline: Research product will not be 
processed during BMT lab processing of patient products to avoid 
contamination. Research products should not be stored in any refrigerator used 
for storage of BMT patient products/samples.  
o Equipment training checklist will include:

 o Preparation of equipment: decontamination procedures of the equipment before 
use, settings, spec imen prep, use of tools, check for cross contamination 
o Operation of equipment: procedure 
o Post operation of equipment: removal of specimen, check for contamination, 
decontamination procedures of the equipment after use.  
o Work counter space  
o Research specimens  and documentation will be isolated to one workstation next 
to biologic safety cabinet assigned.  
o BMT operations will take priority over any research operations. Researchers 
need to schedule their use of BMT lab space with the BMT lab well in advance 
before the date of use. If there is a conflict BMT lab operations takes priority. 
o Any changes to the IRB protocol must be reviewed by [CONTACT_672064].  
o  Any violations in the agreement for the use of BMT lab space, equipment, 
cross-contamination, etc will be immediately brought to the attention of the BMT 
Laboratory Processing Medical Director.

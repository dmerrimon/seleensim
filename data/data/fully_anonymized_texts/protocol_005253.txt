HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981675] of these clinical trials. The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) has 
addressed ethical concerns in the following ways:  
 HVTN trials are designed and condu cted to enhance the knowledge base necessary to 
find a preventive vaccine, using methods that are scientifically rigorous and valid, 
and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.  
 HVTN scientists and operational staff incorporate the philo sophies underlying major 
codes [1-3], declarations, and other guidance documents relevant to human subjects 
research into the design and conduct of HIV vacc ine clinical trials.  
 HVTN scientists and operational staff are committed to substantive community 
input —into the planning, conduct, and follow -up of its research —to help ensure that 
locally appropriate cultural and linguistic needs of study populations are  met. 
Community Advisory Boards (CAB) are required by [CONTACT_432148].   
 HVTN clinical trial staff counsel study participants routinely on how to reduce HIV 
risk. Participants who become HIV -infected during the trial are provided counseling 
on notifying their partners and about HIV infection according to local guidelines. 
Staff members will also counsel them about reducing their risk of transmitting HIV to 
others.  
 Participants who become HIV -infected during the trial are referred to medical 
practitioners to manage their HIV infection and to identify potential clinical trials 
they may want to join.  
 The HVTN provides training so that all participating sites similarly ensure fair 
participant selection, pr otect the privacy of research participants, and obtain 
meaningful informed consent. During the study, participants will have their 
wellbeing monitored, and to the fullest extent possible, their privacy protected. 
Participants may withdraw from the study at  any time.  
 Prior to implementation, HVTN trials are rigorously reviewed by [CONTACT_432149].  
 HVTN trials are reviewed by [CONTACT_719483] w ith all applicable national and local regulations.  
 The HVTN designs its research to minimize risk and maximize benefit to both study 
participants and their local communities. For example, HVTN protocols provide 
enhancement of participants’ knowledge of HIV  and HIV prevention, as well as 
counseling, guidance, and assistance with any social impacts that may result from 
research participation. HVTN protocols also include careful medical review of each 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 5 of 140 research participant’s health conditions and reactions to s tudy products while in the 
study.  
 HVTN research aims to benefit local communities by [CONTACT_719484], support, shared knowle dge, and equipment. 
Researchers involved in HVTN trials are able to conduct other critical research in 
their local research settings.  
 The HVTN values the role of in -country Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) , Ethics 
Committees (ECs) , and other Regulatory E ntities (REs)  as custodians responsible for 
ensuring the ethical conduct of research in each setting.  
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 6 of 140 2 IRB/EC review considerations  
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other US federal regulations require 
IRBs/ECs /REs  to ensure that certain requiremen ts are satisfied on initial and continuing 
review of research (Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 46.111(a) 1 -7; 21 
CFR 56.111(a) 1 -7). The following section highlights how this protocol addresses each of 
these research requirements. Each HV TN Investigator welcomes IRB/EC /RE questions 
or concerns regarding these research requirements.  
2.1 Minimized risks to participants  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 1 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 1: Risks to subjects are minimized.  
This protocol minimizes risks to participants by ( a) correctly and promptly informing 
participants about risks so that they can join in partnership with the researcher in 
recognizing and reporting harms; (b) respecting local/national blood draw limits; (c) 
performing direct observation of participants pos tvaccination and collecting information 
regarding side effects for several days postvaccination; (d) having staff properly trained 
in administering study procedures that may cause physical harm or psychological 
distress, such as blood draws, vaccinations, HIV testing and counseling and HIV risk 
reduction counseling; (e) providing HIV risk reduction counseling and checking on 
contraception use (for women); and (f) providing safety monitoring.  
2.2 Reasonable risk/benefit balance  
45 CFR 46.111(a) 2 and 21 CFR 56.1 11(a) 2 : Risks to subjects are reasonable in 
relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the 
knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result.  
In all public health research, the risk -benefit ratio may be difficult to ass ess because the 
benefits to a healthy participant are not as apparent as they would be in treatment 
protocols, where a study participant may be ill and may have exhausted all conventional 
treatment options. However, this protocol is designed to minimize th e risks to participants 
while maximizing the potential value of the knowledge it is designed to generate.  
2.3 Equitable participant  selection  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 3 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 3: Subject selection is equitable  
This protocol has specific inclusion and  exclusion criteria for investigators to follow in 
admitting participants into the protocol. Participants are selected because of these criteria 
and not because of positions of vulnerability or privilege. Investigators are required to 
maintain screening an d enrollment logs to document volunteers who screened into and 
out of the protocol and for what reasons.  
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 7 of 140 2.4 Appropriate informed consent  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 4 & 5 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 4 & 5: Informed consent is sought 
from each prospective subject or the subje ct’s legally authorized representative as 
required by 45 CFR 46. 116 and 21 CFR Part 50 ; informed consent is appropriately 
documented as required by [ADDRESS_981676] be obtained before any stud y 
procedures are initiated and assessed throughout the trial (see Section 9.1). Each site is 
provided training in informed consent by [CONTACT_719485] p art of its entering the HVTN. 
The HVTN requires a signed consent document for documentation, in addition to chart 
notes or a consent checklist.  
2.5 Adequate safety monitoring  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 6 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 6: There is adequate provision for 
monitori ng the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.  
This protocol has extensive safety monitoring in place (see Section  11). Safety is 
monitored daily by [CONTACT_106806] 119  Protocol Safety Review 
Team (PSRT). In addition, the HVTN Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) periodically 
reviews study data.  
2.[ADDRESS_981677] privacy/confidentiality  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 7 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 7: There are adequate provisions to 
protect the privacy of subjects and maintain the confidentiality of data.  
Privacy refers to an individual’s right to be free from unauthorized or unreasonable 
intrusion into his/her private life and the right to control access to individually 
identifiable information about him/her. The term “privacy” concerns research participan ts 
or potential research participants as individuals whereas the term “confidentiality” is used 
to refer to the treatment of information about those individuals. This protocol respects the 
privacy of participants by [CONTACT_719486] s to their personal 
information and study data (see Appendix A ). The privacy of participants is protected by 
[CONTACT_269954]’s name [CONTACT_269971] . In the [LOCATION_002], researc h participants in HVTN protocols are protected 
by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the US NIH, which can prevent disclosure of 
study participation even when that information is requested by [CONTACT_106809]. Participants are 
told of the use and limits of the certificate in the study consent form.  In addition, each 
staff member at each study site in this protocol signs an Agreement on  Confidentiality 
and Use of Data and Specimens  with the HVTN and each study site participating in the 
protocol is required to hav e a standard operating procedure on how the staff members 
will protect the confidentiality of study participants.

Title 
A phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of pDNA vaccines 
expressing HIV M Group p24Gag conserved ele ments and/or p55Gag, administered with IL-
12 pDNA  by [CONTACT_719487], in healthy, HIV -uninfected adult participants  
Primar y objectives  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the HIV -1 pDNA vaccines p24CE1/2 and 
p55gag administered with IL-12 pDNA  by [CONTACT_719488] h 
electroporation  
 To compare the two pDNA prime/boost strategies with respect to breadth (defined as 
the number of targeted CEs) of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to conserved 
regions of the p24Gag protein  
Study pr oducts and routes of administration  
 p24CE1/2 is a DNA plasmid (pDNA) that encodes 2 cassettes, p24CE1 and p24CE2, 
each consisting of 7 conserved element (CE) sequences from HIV-1 p24Gag separated 
by [CONTACT_719489]. The p24CE1 and p24CE2 proteins differ by 7 amino 
acids and together cover >98% of HIV-1 Group M sequences worldwide. The 
p24CE1 cassette is under the control of the human CMV promoter/enhancer and the 
bovine growth hormone  (BGH) polyadenylation signal. The p24CE2 cassette is in the 
oppo site transcriptional orientation and is under the control of the simian CMV 
promoter and the simian virus 40 (SV40) polyadenylation signal.   
 p55gag refers to a DNA plasmid encoding an expression -optimized full length HIV-1 
p55Gag protein from the HIV -1 mol ecular clone HXB2  (Genbank NP_057850) .  
 IL-12 refers to GENEVAX® IL-12 DNA Plasmid  (Profectus BioSciences, Inc., 
Tarrytown, [LOCATION_001], [LOCATION_003] ). The  IL-12 pDNA adjuvant is a dual promoter plasmid 
that expresses the genes encoding human IL -12 proteins p35 and p40 under separate 
regulatory control. The p35 subunit is under the control of the h uman CMV 
promoter/enhancer and the SV40 polyadenylation signal. The  p40 subunit is under 
the control of the s imian CMV promoter and the BGH polyadenylation signal.  The 
plasmid vaccines will be admixed with IL-12 pDNA to produce a single injectable 
solution delivered by [CONTACT_33813] (IM) injection followed by [CONTACT_719490]. 
 Placebo : Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP 0.9% . 
 Intramuscular TriGrid Delivery System (TDS -IM) (Ichor  Medical Systems, San 
Diego, [LOCATION_004] ), a device for electroporation mediated intramuscular 
administration of DNA based -biologic candidates.

All injections will be delivered IM followed by [CONTACT_151638]  (IM/EP) . The doses 
shown will be divided between 2 injection sites, such that 2 mg p24 CE1/2 or p55gag 
pDNA vaccine , or a mixture of 1 mg each, and 1 mg IL-12 pDNA , or placebo,  will be 
given in each deltoid at every vaccination timepoint.  
Enrollment will proceed in both groups simultaneously and will be restricted to US 
HVTN Clinical Research Sites (CRSs). Across the participating CRSs, enrollment will be 
restricted to a maximum of [ADDRESS_981678] been enrol led. 
The HVTN 119 Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) will review the cumulative safety 
data on each of these [ADDRESS_981679] 72 hours postvaccination, and will determine 
whether it is safe to proceed with full enrollment in that group.

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981682] employed consensus and deduced 
ancestral sequences  [4-6], as well as created antigenic combinations of common variants 
that evolve as a result of immune pressure  (eg, mosaics  [7-10] and similar  structures  
[11,12 ]), with the goal of blocking common escape forms of viruses and thus effective ly 
block immunological escape pathways. However, it may not be possible to vaccinate with 
all of the viral antigenic diversity required to block viable or transition escape forms of 
the virus —as rapid, sequential epi[INVESTIGATOR_719414] , including uncommon inter mediates,  is 
commonplace early in infection  [13,14] . For example , a study of the recognition of the 
most common mutant forms of the HIV Nef protein (representing ~65% of the known 
variation of this protein), found that peptides were not recognized based on the ir 
frequency in the virus population  [15]. Thus, the immunogen sequence diversity that may 
be required to block viable or transition escape mutants may be too large to accommodate 
for a single or a manageably s ized variation inclusive vaccine.  
Another important concern is  that presentation of variable epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], such as provided by a 
mosaic -like vaccine, would result in immunodominance (i e, hierarchical preference for 
recognition of one epi[INVESTIGATOR_719415] r another, magnified by [CONTACT_719491]) or immunodominating responses (i e, suppression of some 
responses by [CONTACT_2312]) by [CONTACT_105] -protective epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. Non-protective epi[INVESTIGATOR_719416] a lack of vi rologic containment in vivo  (eg, high viral load) 
or those that can readily escape without impairing viral fitness. Immunodominant 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_719417] a high degree of conservation do not necessarily confer immune control of 
viral replication, as they may repres ent viral adaptation to human HLA types at the 
population level, and at minimal fitness cost [16-18]. It seems likely  that if HIV segments 
were  capable of mutating w ithout limiting virus functionality, they would not contribute 
substantially to a vaccine’s protective response. We further suggest that variable epi[INVESTIGATOR_719418] “decoys” that can absorb immune reactivity and 
potentially preclude respo nses against protective epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. For example, the most 
significant difference between HIV strains infecting vaccine vs. placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_719419] (HVTN 502)  vaccine trial occurred within a region including the SLYNTVATL 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_719420]  [19], an immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], responses to which are not associated 
with diminution of viral load  [20]. Although unproven, SLYNTVATL reactivity may 
therefore represent an immunodominant decoy response that is detrimental to vaccine 
efficacy  [21].  
This trial will evaluate the safety and immuno genicity of a novel vaccine encoding 
“conserved elements” (CE) of the HIV -1 Gag core protein, p24Gag. The p24CE 1/2 pDNA  
vaccine is composed exclusively of two gene segments (p24CE1 and p24CE2, on one 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 13 of 140 plasmid, referred to as p24CE 1/2 pDNA ) expressing carefu lly selected portions of the 
HIV-[ADDRESS_981683] abundant protein in HIV virions  (Figure 4-1). 
p24Gag was chosen because of its availability as an immune target during infection , and 
because CTL responses to Gag, and in particular the p24Gag component of Gag, have been 
associated in numerous studies with greater control of HIV viremia  [22-32]. The 
sequences expressed by p24CE 1/2 pDNA  correspond to the portions of p24Gag found in 
nearly every HIV -1 (M group) strain observed to date throughout the world. Unlike most 
of the HIV -[ADDRESS_981684] rarely if a t all been observed to 
mutate (f or the most part they are composed of amino acids conserved in at least 98% of 
all HIV -1 infections), and represent components that are enriched with those essential to 
virus inf ectivity.  
The following observations guided the design  of the p24CE 1/2 pDNA vaccine : 
1. HIV mutates to sequences that contain ancestral amino acids  (AA)  when transmitted 
to a new host, essentially recovering a more fit state in the absence of the specific 
immune responses that shaped the viral genome in the previous host  [33-35]. Hence, 
the p24CE1/2 vaccine is composed of conserved, ancestral, center of tree [6] 
sequences.  
2. CTL that target specific viral proteins have reproducible effects on viral load. 
Numerous studies have shown  that robust Gag -specific CTL contain infection  [22-
32], whereas CTL responses against the HIV -[ADDRESS_981685] Env and the accessory proteins correlate 
with a lack of control of viremi a [16-18,22,23] . 
3. Changes in conserved amino acids, especially in Gag, often but not always will 
debilitate or inactivate the virus  [36-40]. In contrast, the majority of escape mutations 
in Env [36,39]  or Nef [41] have a neutral or an enhancing impact on viral replication 
fitness . Hence, the p24CE1/[ADDRESS_981686] no tably 
those with HLA B*57 , B*58  [42-47], and B*27 [42,46,48 -51] alleles. These same 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_719421] p24CE1/2 vaccine, and importantly, they are also targets 
of immune responses in virologic “controllers” that do not possess these HLA 
proteins  [52]. This illustrates the criticality of the viral protein sequence being 
targeted by [CONTACT_27639], as opposed to the HLA type, in controlling infection.  
5. Viruses from “elite controllers” (i e, plasma HIV RNA <50  copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL in the absence 
of antiretroviral therapy) have impaired replication capacity both in acute/early  
[47,53]  and in chronic infection  [47,54] . 
6. Immunodominance of some epi[INVESTIGATOR_719422], 
potentially protective epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] s, whereas responses to subdominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_719423]  [55-57]. This suggests that an immunogen 
should not mimic the immunodominance elicited in most natural infections (B*57, 
B*58 and B*27 individuals being a notable exception). Hence, a focus on careful 
exclusion of these epi[INVESTIGATOR_719424].   
7. Some AA segments in HIV proteins are conserved throughout a given HIV -1 
subtype, the entire M group o f HIV -1, and in some instances also in HIV -2 and SIV  
[56,58] . This is especially true for AA conserved since the begi nning of the HIV 
pandemic, as opposed to those that have had HLA imprinting occur, with 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981687] conserved AA state [37]. 
These segments make up the p24CE1/2 pDNA vaccine, are generally critical to viral 
function, and thus represent the Achilles’ heel of the virus . 
Recently a similar approach focusing on conserved elements is being taken, albeit with a 
heavy emphasis on Pol protein segments, in the European community [59]. Inclusion of 
conserved element approaches into the HVTN portfolio significantly broadens its 
scientific agenda.  
The focus of the study is a pDNA prime -boost vaccine  regimen, comprising p24CE 1/2 
pDNA prime followed by p24CE 1/2+ p55gag pDNA booster vaccination. This regimen 
focuses the priming response to highly conserved , but subdominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] , which we 
hypothesize will then be boosted, and possibly broadened  by a combination of p24CE1/[ADDRESS_981688] regimens . Group 
1 will receive p24CE1/2  pDNA prime followed by [CONTACT_3252] -delivery of p24CE1/2  pDNA and 
full-length gag pDNA (CE/CE+ gag). Group [ADDRESS_981689] with the full -
length gag pDNA (gag/gag). The vaccines will be co -administered with IL-12 pDNA , 
and given with electroporation . Four vaccinations  will be  given in the series , with 
priming vaccinations  at 0 and 1 month, and boos t vaccinations  given at 3  and 6 months. 
Cellular and humoral immune responses in vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_719425] a 
control set of individuals given placebo injections  given with electroporation  on the same 
schedule .  
In summary, we hypothesize that by [CONTACT_719492] -1 p24Gag protein that 
are invariable across Group M viruses, this vaccine approach may elicit specific immune 
responses linked to protection  and viral control , rather than immune responses that may 
include decoy responses with detrimental effects or limited antiviral potential.

Figure 4-1 Alignment of p 24CE1, p24CE2 and p24Gag proteins. The schematic representation at 
the top of the figure shows the p55Gag and its proteolyti c processing products including p24Gag 
protein. Below is the alignment of the amino acid (AA) sequences of the consensus p24Gag 
sequences of different HIV -1 clades and of the seven CE encoded by [CONTACT_941] p24CE1/2 pDNA vaccine. 
The AA sequences of the p24Gag of different HIV -1 clades (A, B, C), group M consensus, COT -M, 
and of the p24CE1 and p24CE2 proteins are shown. The CE1 to CE7 sequences with the single 
AA change per CE are indicated.  
4.2 p24CE1 /2 pDNA  
p24CE1/2 pDNA (Figure 4-2) is a  dual promoter plasmid generated to express the 
p24CE1 gene from the human CMV promoter and the p24CE2 gene from the simian 
CMV promoter in the opposite transcriptional orientation . There are 7 CE segments of 
13, 18, 24, 20, 20, 14 and 1 8 amino acids in the p24 CE pDNA vaccine [58]. One 
“toggled” amino acid is included in each of the 7 CE segments, resulting in two protein 
coding elements  (p24CE1 and p24CE2) differing by a total of 7 codons, each sharing  127 
amino acids  with p24Gag. Codin g sequences were optimized to enhance expression in 
human cells  [60-65]. The p24CE  sequences represent 54% of p24Gag, including most 
extended coiled regions of the protein. CE regions include amino acids at p24Gag hexamer 
interfaces, which provide a structural rationale for their conservation, and CE are 
enriched with AA sites that if mutated to the second -most common AA found in the HIV 
database, nonetheless result in noninfectious virus  [37,38] .  
The plasmid also contains two polyadenylation signals (bovine growth hormone polyA 
signal for p24CE1 and the simian viru s 40 polyA signal  for p24CE2). Of note, the 
promoter and polyA signal for the p24CE1 gene are identical to the single gene 
expression vector used to express the p55Gag protein. Furthermore, the promoters and poly 
A signals are the same as used in the dual expression IL-12 pDNA plasmid to be used in 
the trial (although promoters and poly A signals were combined differently).  

HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 16 of 140 The CE segment s are separated by [CONTACT_719493] 0-3 amino acids in length composed of 
Alanine , or Alanine and Lysine , or Alanine and Glycine.  The total len gth of the proteins 
spans 157 AA including 17 AA of the GM -CSF signal peptide and 13 AA of linker 
sequences. It is known that inclusion of protease cleavage sites in DNA vaccines can 
enhance immunogenicity and preserve epi[INVESTIGATOR_719426]  [66]. The length and 
sequence of the linker sequences were therefore set based on the existing knowledge of 
cleavage specificities and peptide availability  [67], as well as to avoid fortuitous 
junctional homologies with HIV and the human proteome, the latter determined by 
[CONTACT_719494]  [68]. 
Production levels of p24CE proteins from the dual expression plasmid were 
indistinguishable from the combination of the two single vectors (unpublished). In studies 
performed in macaques, n o difference s in the levels of induced immune responses were 
noted using the single p24CE1/2 pDNA expressing p24CE1 and p24CE2 genes (N=10) 
versus the combination of two vectors, each expressing one of the two respective genes  
(N=6) (see Figure 4-5) [69-71]. 
  
Figure 4-2 Schematic of the p24CE1/2 pDNA (plasmid code 306H)  
For the clinical trial, t he p24CE1/2 pDNA  is produced at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, 
and is formulated in 30 mM citrate buffer pH 6.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% 
ethylenedi amine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)  and 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] -HCl. The pDNA  was 
manufactured by A jinomoto Althea, San Diego, CA.  The pDNA is formulated in 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] , a local anesthetic  that forms stable liposomal -like structures upon direct 
mixing with pDNA and fu rther protects pDNA from degradation  [72]. The p24CE1/2  
pDNA  will be admixed with IL-12 pDNA , or with p55gag and IL-12 pDNA , to produce a 
single injectable solution.  The p24CE1/2  pDNA  has not been tested in humans.  
p24CE1/2 pDNA vaccine formulated in water given IM with EP has been tested in 
macaques monitored for >2 years without any adverse effects.  
The p24CE1/2 (plasmid 306H) and p55gag (plasmid 114H , see Section 4.3) pDNAs both 
use a plasmid backbone that i s derived from pVR1012 [73] (Figure 4-3). The pVR1012 
plasmid backbone has also been used in  DNA vaccine studies  including the following:

 the p55gag plasmid DNA VRC4401 (Vaccine Research Center, NIAID; GenBank 
CS070894) that has been used in  a clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) as part of the DNA

Figure 4-3 Comparis on of plasmids derived from pVR1012 . Plasmids VRC4413, VRC4305 and 
VRC4311 express gag-pol-nef using mammalian expression vector pVR1012. The plasmid 
backbone of p55gag (plasmid 114H) and p24CE1/2 (plasmid 306H) are also derived from pVR1012. 
Differences in pDP.CMVkan and pCMV.kan backbones are indicated in red (single nt change in the 
hCMV promoter, lack of CMV IE  intron, 5 nt insertion between pUC and CMV promoter; 
pDP.CMVkan contains a cassette inserted within pUC that includes the simian CMV promoter and 
the SV40polyA signal sequence. Each vector has unique inserts.  
In summary, t he pCMVkan and pDP.CMVkan plasmid  backbones used in p24CE1/2 and 
p55gag pDNAs, respectively, and that of pVR1012  can be compared as follows : 
o identical BGH polyA signal,  
o identical kanamycin resistance gene  
o identical origin of replication , colE1  
o identical pUC nucleotide sequence between ba ckbone segments  
with these differences:  
o one nucleotide difference in the human CMV promoter (745 nt): thymidine at 
position 362 in p55gag and p24CE1/2 pDNA instead of cytosine .  
o lack of the intronic sequence; according to our studies, splicing is not necessary for 
efficient expression of RNA -optimized genes; also, the presence of splice sites may 
generate alternatively spliced mRNAs encoding aberrant proteins  
o insertion of 5 nucleotides (TGGCC) at the junction of pUC plasmid and human CMV 
promoter in pC MVkan and pDP.CMVkan  
o presence of simian CMV promoter in the pDP.CMVkan derived plasmid p24CE1/2

T-cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_719427]:  
1. To ensure that the epi[INVESTIGATOR_719428], 40 -mer peptides encompassing each CE as well as junctional 
regions were generated and subjected to pro teolytic processing by [CONTACT_719495]. Fifteen of 16 known epi[INVESTIGATOR_719429] 1 -3 AA extended 
degradation products in these assays (Le Gall et al., unpublished).  
2. To determine whether CE are conserved because they are immunologic ally silent 
(due to impaired presentation on HLA), or because they have functional significance , 
T-cell responses to p24Gag were evaluated in 50 HIV -1 infected subjects without  
protective HLA class I alleles  [52]. These 50 individuals consisted of HIV -1 
controllers (<2,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_268720]/mL) and non -controllers (>50,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_268720]/mL) 
and excluded those with HLA*B27/57/58 alleles in order to focus development on 
immunogens for the majority of people without such favorab le genetic backgrounds 
and, potentially, without the perhaps unique mechanisms of immune control [74] 
exhibited by [CONTACT_44688]*B27/57/58 e xpressing individuals. For those without the 
aforementioned protective HLA alleles, recognition of HIV may be more likely to be 
obscured by [CONTACT_719496]. p24CE were  found to be 
rich in epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], with >30 epi[INVESTIGATOR_719430] >40 different HLA class I molecules 
in the 50 subjects [52]. Interestingly, >70% of all responses to specific 10 -mer 
peptides and their embedded optimally defined epi[INVESTIGATOR_719431] [52], further supporting our approach to 
use CE rather than only known epi[INVESTIGATOR_719432]. The 25 controllers tested 
preferentially recognized the TW10 and KK10 epi[INVESTIGATOR_719433], which were  
previously associated with control in B*57/B*58, and B*27 individuals, respectively, 
even though these controllers did NOT possess these “protective” alleles. Differential 
reactivity was also focused on a known B*14 DA9 epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], again targeted by 
[CONTACT_719497] B14 allele. In conclusion, the specific epi[INVESTIGATOR_719434], and not necessarily the HLA type, are critical for the control of infection.  
As the vaccine plasmids as well as the IL-12 plasmid  are formulated in 0.25% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] , there is a risk of allergic reaction, including rash, urticaria, angioedema, 
bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis. Significant adverse experiences including cardiac arrest 
and death have  occurred following intravenous  delivery of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. In most cases, 
this has followed use of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_142245] a dose of 1.6 mg/kg. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_719435] a dose of 2.5 mg/ml (maximum 2 ml, or 5 mg). A 50 kg person 
would receive a dose of 0.1 mg/kg per dose administered. Participants with a history o f 
allergic reaction to amide -type local anesthetics (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] [Marcaine], lidocaine 
[Xylocaine], mepi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] [Polocaine/Carbocaine], etidocaine [Duranest], prilocaine 
[Citanest, EMLA® cream]) will be excluded.   
4.3 p55gag pDNA  
The p55gag pDNA (plasmid 114H)  contains expression -optimized full length HIV-1 
p55gag gene  from the HIV -1 molecular clone HXB2  (Genbank NP_057850)  cloned into 
the pCMVkan plasmid between the human CMV promoter and the bovine growth 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 19 of 140 hormone polyA signal  (Figure 4-4). The p55gag pDNA and the p24CE1/2 pDNA share the 
same plasmid backbone which is described above in Section 4.2. Like the p24CE1/2 
pDNA, the p55gag pDNA is formulated in bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  
 
Figure 4-4 Schematic of p55gag pDNA  
p55gag pDNA  is produced at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, in 30 mM citrate buffer pH 6.5 
containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% EDTA and 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] -HCl. The pDNA  was 
manufactured by A jinomoto Althea, San Diego, CA. The p55gag pDNA will be admixed 
with IL-12 pDNA  or with p 24CE1/[ADDRESS_981691] been tested in several clinical trials , 
including HVTN 060, 063, 070, 080, 087, and no significant adverse effects related to 
vaccine were reported.  
4.4 IL-12 pDNA adjuvant  
The GENEVAX® IL-12 DNA plasmid is a dual promoter expression plasmid which 
expresses the genes encoding human IL -12 subunits  p35 and p40 under separate 
regulatory control. The p35 subunit is under the control of the hCMV promoter/enhanc er 
and the SV40 polyadenylation signal. The p40 subunit is under the control of the sCMV 
promoter and the BGH polyadenylation signal. The plasmid contains a chimeric 
kanamycin resistance gene and a pUC bacterial origin of replication. The IL-12 pDNA 
adjuva nt is be produced at a concentration of 2 mg/mL  and is formulated in 30 mM 
citrate buffer pH 6.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% EDTA , and 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] - 
HCl. The plasmid is formulated in bupi[INVESTIGATOR_719436]  [72]. It was manufactured by A jinomoto Althea , San Diego, CA.  
The IL-12 pDNA adjuvant will be given together  with the p24CE1/2 pDNA, the p55gag 
pDNA and the p24CE1/2 and p55gag pDNA combination, respectively and will be 
delivered with electroporation (EP). HVTN 080, a phase 1 clinical trial, has demo nstrated 

HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 20 of 140 the safety and immunogenicity of 3 mg PENNVAX™ -B (gag, pol, env ) vaccine (Inovio 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) with 1 mg IL-12 pDNA (Profectus BioS ciences, Inc.)  given by 
[CONTACT_204173]/EP [75]. In addition, recent work by [CONTACT_719498], Felber and colleagues has shown 
inducti on of immunity with the proposed vector given with IL-12 pDNA EP in rhesus 
macaques, with superior CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell as well as Ab responses [76-78]. Other 
clinical trials (HVTN 087, IAVI B004) have shown reduced CD4+ T-cell response rates 
in groups given IL-12 pDNA, while CD8+ T-cell responses were equivalent or improved, 
compared to study arms without IL-12 pDNA [79,80] . The IL-12 pDNA adjuvant, 
GENEVAX® IL-12 DNA Plasmid, has been tested by [CONTACT_719499] 5 previous trials: 
HVTN 060 (DAIDS -ES ID [ZIP_CODE], BB IND#[ZIP_CODE]), HVTN 063 (DAIDS -ES ID [ZIP_CODE], 
BB IND#[ZIP_CODE]), HVTN 070 (DAIDS -ES ID [ZIP_CODE], BB IND#[ZIP_CODE]), HVTN 080 
(DAIDS -ES ID [ZIP_CODE], BB IND#[ZIP_CODE]), and HVTN 087 (DA IDS-ES ID [ZIP_CODE], BB 
IND#[ZIP_CODE]). Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for additional information.  
4.5 Electrop oration (EP)  
EP has been shown to be an efficient means to introduce DNA into cells  [81]. EP is a 
technology in which a transient electric field is applied  to the target tissue in order  to 
enhance the cellular uptake of large molecules such as DNA. EP works by [CONTACT_719500] t he permeability of cell membranes. Although EP has been used 
experimentally in humans  [82,83] , EP remains investigational. Preclinical and phase [ADDRESS_981692] suggested that EP enhanc es the potency of pDNA vaccines [80,84 -87]. Ichor 
Medical Systems has focused on the development of EP technology where the means for 
agent administration and electric field application are integrated into a fully automated 
administration device. The ov erarching goal of this approach, embodied in the Ichor 
TDS -IM, is to enable agent administration, placement of electrodes, and timing of EP 
delivery to be completed in a simple, user independent fashion. Each TDS -IM device 
consists of three components, a s ingle use Application Cartridge housing the EP 
electrodes and the agent of interest, a handheld, multi -use Integrated Applicator, and a 
Pulse Stimulator. The TriGrid™ electrode array for intramuscular delivery consist of four 
electrodes arranged in two tri angles to form a diamond shape around an integrated central 
injection needle. Correlation of the electrode configuration with the agent distribution 
pattern intrinsic to the target tissue ensures that the EP effect is induced only in tissues 
where the agen t of interest has been distributed , improving tolerability and minimizing 
tissue disruption. To date, the TDS -IM has been used for IM delivery of DNA vaccines 
or placebo in over [ADDRESS_981693] regimen of HIV -1 nef/tat/vif, env  pDNA vaccine delivered intramuscularly 
with electroporation and HIV -1 rVSV envC  vaccine in healthy HIV -uninfected adult 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 21 of 140 participants (BB IND #[ZIP_CODE] , DAIDS -ES ID [ZIP_CODE] ). In HVTN 112, an event occurred 
in which the EP device was difficult to rem ove from a person’s arm , causing severe pain 
and stress . The participant  was receiving injection with EP for the first time. Pain was 
managed with local anesthesia to allow device removal. After the event, the person had 
some pain, tenderness, and bruising , but did not have any serious adverse reactions, and 
quickly resumed normal activities. After investigation, the conclusion is that the device 
had functioned normally , but that in  this case, there may have been an unusual mismatch 
between the device setti ng specified for the person’s arm skinfold measurement, and the 
person’s arm physique  (ie, skin and deltoid muscle thickness) which led to contact 
[CONTACT_719501] . This happened in one participant 
out of 15 in this stud y, and has not been previously reported  with this device before, in 
over 700 other subjects , and over 3000  administrations . 
Please refer to the TDS -IM Investigator’s Brochure for additional information regarding 
the TDS -IM device.  
4.6 Trial design rationale  
One major goal of the proposed phase 1 trial is to demonstrate that a DNA plasmid 
expressing the  CE regions of p24Gag, given with IL-12 pDNA adjuvant and IM/ EP 
delivery, has an acceptable safety profile . 
The proposed trial is also designed as a proof -of-concept demonstration that conserved 
elements of the viral p24Gag protein, normally subdominant in HIV infections, can be 
immunogenic, can induce levels of immune response comparable to full -length Gag, can 
potently shift the immunodominance of Gag epi[INVESTIGATOR_719437] p24Gag protein when used in a CE/CE+ gag prime/boost vaccination  regimen , and 
can induce increased levels of polyfunctional and cytotoxic T cells directed to CE 
compared to the full -length Gag antigen administered a s a pDNA vaccine . IL-[ADDRESS_981694] on CD8+ 
responses and provide an advantage to the evaluation of immunogenicity of the 
p24CE 1/2 and p55gag pDNA vaccines . 
4.6.1  Dose (amount and number)  
The DNA vaccines (p24CE 1/2, p55gag) will be given at 4 mg total dose per vaccination (2 
mg per deltoid). Doses of DNA vaccines previously  given in HVTN studies with IM/ EP 
have ranged from [ADDRESS_981695] immune responses.  
GENEVAX® IL-12 DNA plasmid  will be given at 2 mg total dose per vaccination (1 mg 
per deltoid). Doses of IL-12 pDNA  adjuvant previously given in HVTN studies with 
IM/EP have ranged from 0.25 mg to 1 .5 mg, with up  to 1 mg given at a single injection 
site. 
In HVTN 080 (see Section 4.10.3 ), which showed an increase in ICS response rates (not 
statistically significant, possibly due to small sample sizes), [ADDRESS_981696] seen in HVTN 080. IL-12 pDNA has not been associated with severe

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981697] the minimal increase to 2 mg total dose ( 1 mg per injection 
site) to be safe and well tolerated both at the i njection sites and systemically.  
4.6.[ADDRESS_981698] regimen of 4 vaccinations  will be  given , with injections at 0, 1  (priming 
immun ogen ) and  3, 6 months (booster immunogen (s)). This schedule allows for 
comparison with other HVTN studie s of DNA vaccines given with IM/ EP, which 
vaccinated participants on schedules of 0, 1 and 3 months or 0, 1, 3 and 6 months. Group 
1 (CE/CE+ gag) receives a combination of [ADDRESS_981699]. Group 2 
(gag/gag) receives one immunogen as both the prime and the boost. Partially 
heterologous boost vaccinations are proposed in Group [ADDRESS_981700] immune responses.  
4.6.3  Choice of control  
Sodium Chloride for Injection,  USP 0.9% , will serve as the placebo for the p24CE 1/2 
pDNA vaccine , the p55gag pDNA vaccine, and IL-12 pDNA. Sodium Chloride for 
Injection, USP 0.9% is nonreactogenic and well tolerated.  It will be delivered by [CONTACT_204173] /EP 
as a control  for blinding purposes.  It is possible that the presence of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_719438]. This should not adversely affect the efficiency of blinding.

the viral proteome, and for the development of additional CE  immunogens corresponding 
to other regions of HIV-1 proteins  and a therapeutic vaccine to target the highly 
conserved less exhausted epi[INVESTIGATOR_719439] . 
4.8 Preclinical safety studies  
During pre -IND review, the Center for Bi ologics Evaluation and Research  concurred that 
preclinical safety studies with the p24CE1/2 pDNA and p55gag pDNA study products 
were not necessary based on previous nonclinical and clinical experience with similar 
products. DAIDS has developed significant nonclinical and clinical experience  with 
pDNAs formulated in bupi[INVESTIGATOR_719440] (multiple investigational 
products), and with IL-[ADDRESS_981702] been evaluated in a macaque study that 
extended more than 2 years,  using endotoxin -free DNA preparations purified with the 
Qiagen kit in the laboratory. This study not only demonstrated that the animals developed 
durab le cellular and humoral immune responses, but also that no adverse effects were 
observed, either after the initial vaccination series or after an additional booster 
vaccination at approximately 2 years. Furthermore, the cGMP p24CE1/[ADDRESS_981703] been tested in an immunological and observational study 
in C57BL/6 mice (N=5/group). Mice were administered 20 micrograms of pDNA/mouse 
(2 vaccinations at 0 and 4 months and  sacrificed 2 weeks later) via IM/EP. No adverse 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 23 of 140 effects we re observed and the mice developed similar levels of antigen -specific cellular 
immune responses compared to mice vaccinated in parallel arms within the same study 
with the laboratory -produced endotoxin -free pDNAs.  
4.9 Preclinical immunogenicity studies  
A varie ty of model systems were used to demonstrate  that delivery of p24CE pDNA 
would induce strong immune responses. A series of proof -of-concept studies ( Table 4-1), 
detailed in S ections 4.9.2  and 4.9.3 , were conducted in mice  and macaques. The vaccine 
concept aiming to focus the immune responses to the highly conserved CE sequences of 
the Gag capsid protein was developed and tested for HIV, and, using an analogous 
design, for SIV, which will allow in vivo  testing of vaccine ef ficacy in a macaque 
challenge model. Briefly, these studies demonstrated that vaccination with CE pDNA 
induces potent immune responses to subdominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], which could not be achieved 
by [CONTACT_719502] -length Gag. Vaccine reg imens including 
booster vaccinations with gag pDNA or co -delivery of CE+ gag pDNA greatly augment 
the cytotoxic CE -specific responses, however the latter booster regimen maximizes the 
breadth of the responses to the otherwise subdominant CE epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. Thus, in preclinical 
trials, the regimen consisting of p24CE1/2 pDNA priming followed by [CONTACT_3252] -delivery of 
CE+gag pDNA booster vaccination results in immune responses with greatest magnitude, 
breadth and cytotoxicity. This vaccine regimen has been selected for the clinical trial.

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 25 of 140 4.9.1  Immuno genicity of p24CE ex vivo  
Transfection of CE -encoding RNA into human dendritic cells derived from HIV -
seronegative individuals was used to present p24CE1 antigen to autologous naïve T cells 
in order to generate primary human immune T -cell responses to CE ex vivo . Levels of 
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses comparable to that o f the full -length Gag protein  were 
generated , even though only the  p24CE1 protein (without p24CE2) was used as 
immunogen  [90] (and unpublished).  
4.9.2  Immunogenicity of p24CE DNA in mice  
Study 1 ( Table 4-1): Balb/c, C57BL/6, and HLA -transgenic C57BL /6 mice (expressing 
human HLA A*02 or B*07)  [88] were immunized with pDNA expressing CE or ful l-
length Gag . Different leader sequences  were used  to alter intracellular trafficking of the 
CE immunogens, thus manipulat ing protein localization, stability, and also the nature of 
elicited immune responses. The GM -CSF leader was chosen to move forward into human 
studies. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with full -length p55gag pDNA induced poor 
CD4+ T-cell mediated responses  against CE , and to only [ADDRESS_981706] T -cell responses to 4 of the 7 CE. The CE-induced responses were multifunctional 
and composed of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with mature cytotoxic phenotype s. In 
contrast,  p55gag pDNA induced immune response s recognized the CE only weakly or  not 
at all . p24CE pDNA vaccination also induced humoral immune responses similar in 
magnitude to those induced by p55gag pDNA , which recognize the virus encoded p24Gag 
protein. Similarly, p55gag pDNA induced humoral immune responses did not recognize 
the CE. Togethe r, p24CE pDNA vaccine induces cellular and humoral immune responses 
that are only poorly or not induced by [CONTACT_456250] -length gag DNA vaccination.  
In addition to testing laboratory -purified plasmids, C57BL/6 mice were also vaccinated 
with the Althea produced cGMP  p24CE1/2 and p55gag pDNA preparations. This study 
showed the expected induction of antigen -specific T cell responses, recapi[INVESTIGATOR_719441] [83]. The immune responses induced with the cGMP DNAs 
paralleled those obtained with laboratory -produced pDNA preparations. These data 
support qualification of these cGMP plasmid preparations for the clinical trial.  
4.9.3  Immuno genicity of p24CE DNA in macaques  
Strong immunogenicity induced by [CONTACT_941] p24CE1/2 pDNA  was also demonstrated in 
Rhesus macaques [69-71], and novel prime -boost regimens were developed to maximize  
magnitude, breadth and the generation of cytotoxic T cell responses recognizing the CE.  
Studies 2 and 3 ( Table 4-1): These studies were conducted in m acaques  which received 
vaccinat ions with a combination of the two HIV p24CE 1and p24CE2 single expression 
vectors (study 2) or with the dual expression vector p24CE1/ 2 (study 3) to examine the 
immu nogenicity of the CE immunogen. The animals received 2 vaccinations (0 and 2 
months), except for 2 animals (M437, P314) that were primed at 0, 2, and [ADDRESS_981707] vaccination 
by [CONTACT_719503] 7 CE  (Figure 4-5), and compared 
with results from study 6, in which animals were primed with the dual ex pression vector 
p24CE1/ 2 pDNA at months 0 and 1 ( Table 4-1).

Figure 4-5 p24CE pDNA vaccine is immunogenic in macaqu es. Macaques (N=16) were 
vaccinated with a mixture of p24CE1&p24CE2 pDNA (N=6) or the dual expression vector 
p24CE1/2 (N=10; 4 animals from study 3 and 6 animals from study 6).  The pDNA vaccine for all 
animals, except M437 and P314, also contained 0.2 mg macaque IL-12 pDNA. The frequency of 
CE-specific IFN -γ+ T cells was measured two weeks after the last priming vaccination using CE -
specific peptide pools composed of a mixture of  15-mer overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_10373] 11 AA and 10 -mer peptides 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_10373] 9 AA covering both p24CE1 and p24CE2 proteins. The CE -specific CD4+ (open 
bars, labeled CD4) and CD8+ (filled bars, labeled CD8) T cells are shown.  
All animals developed CE -specific cellular r esponses, as measured by [CONTACT_20129] -γ production, 
with a frequency ranging from 0.1% to 0.8% of total T cells in blood  (Figure 4-5). These  
responses were elic ited by [CONTACT_295537]4+ and CD8+ T cells , of both central (CD28+, CD95+) 
and effector memory phenotype (CD28-, CD95+), and included cytotoxic and 
polyfunctional  CE-specific T cells, as defined by [CONTACT_719504] B content, ability to 
secrete two cytokines (IFN -γ and TNF -α) and ability to degranulate (CD107a).  Both t he 
combination of individual p24CE1 and p24CE2 pDNAs  (study 2)  and the dual expression 
plasmid p24CE1/2 (studies 3 and 6) induced similar CE -specific responses . 
Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_719442] -specific responses show ed a response breadth of 1 -3 CE per animal  
(median = 3) . Thus, the p24CE pDNA vaccine induce d a broader response than  the gag 
DNA vaccine, which elicited CE-specific T cell responses  in only ~50% of the animals 
with a narrower response breadth of 0 -3 CE per animal  (median = 0) . The breadth of the 
CE-specific responses obtained by [CONTACT_941] 2 vaccine regimens is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 4-6,

significantly increased  (p=0.0115 ) the IFN -γ+ CE-specific T cells (reaching up to ~3% of 
the total T cell population)  (Figure 4-7) and the CE-specific polyfunctional cytotoxic T 
cells (as measured by 4 functions; p = 0.0068; Figure  4-8).

after the p55gag pDNA booster vaccination. Polyfunctional (granzyme B+, IFN -γ+ TNF-+ and 
CD107a+) CE-specific responses were measured [ADDRESS_981710] antibody responses in macaques [70]. These antibody responses recognized  linear 
CE epi[INVESTIGATOR_719445] p24CE proteins, whereas the full -length Gag immunogen 
failed to elicit responses that recognized CE (studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, humoral  
responses to CE were greatly enhanced by a full -length Gag booster vaccination  (studies 
4 and 5) . Thus , the CE pDNA vaccine induces potent cellular and humoral immune 
responses to subdominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_719446] p55gag pDNA 
booster vaccination.  
Together, studies [ADDRESS_981711] potentially “decoy” epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], while focusing responses to CE, for 
which few viable escape pathways may exist.

which was performed earlier, using analogous molecules from SIV, and corresponded to 
the most effective protocol found to induce the broadest recognition of SIV Gag CE . 
Study 6 included 2 priming vaccinations (0, 1 month) with HIV p24CE1/2 pDNA ( Figure 
4-5) followed by 2 booster vaccinations (4, 6 months) with co -delivery of 
p24CE1/2+p55gag pDN A (Figure 4-9). All vaccinations included macaque IL-[ADDRESS_981712] CE -specific responses (median 0.3% of T cells),  
which were significantly  increased by [CONTACT_719506] , reaching maximal 
responses after the 2nd booster vaccination (median 1.5% of T cells) (Figure 4-9).

The CE -specific responses were mediated both by [CONTACT_398]4+ and CD8+ T cells with a skewing

highly cytotoxic CE -specific IFN -+ T cells with a frequency of >89% of granzyme B+.

separately the number of vaccinations including p24CE pDNA are given. The median number of 
CE recognized, the range of  CE responses, and the number of animals analyzed are indicated. P 
values are from an ANOVA (Dunnett’s test).  Peptide -stimulated samples were considered positive 
if the responses were 2 -fold higher than that of the unstimulated medium only control and grea ter 
than 0.01 after subtracting the medium control value. Samples were acquired on a LSR II or 
Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and the data were analyzed using 
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).  
Priming with HIV p24CE p DNA is critical to induce immune responses to subdominant 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], and inclusion of the p24CE pDNA together with a plasmid expressing the full -
length immunogen (study 6) as a boost is the most effective protocol to induce desirable 
responses with greatest  breadth, magnitude and cytotoxic capability. Importantly, study 6 
using HIV vaccine constructs recapi[INVESTIGATOR_719448] (study 9). Hence, this 
vaccine regimen is proposed for the clinical trial.  

HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 32 of 140 4.9.4  Immuno genicity of SIV p27CE DNA in macaques  
By [CONTACT_719510], molecules derived from SIV p27Gag were 
designed (p27CE1 and p27CE2) and tested in macaques [71]. The findings of the SIV 
p27CE studies (studies 7 -9) recapi[INVESTIGATOR_719449] (studies 2 -6), each 
supporting the observation that a priming vaccination with CE pDNA focuses responses 
to subdominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], allowing a change of the immunodominance hierarchy and 
leading to increased breadth and cytotoxicity.  
Study 7  (Table 4-1): Macaques received 3 vaccinations with a combination of p27CE1 
and p27CE2 pDNA at 0, 2 and 4 months, with  macaque IL-12 pDNA. Analysis of the 
vaccine -induced immunity demonstrated that  all 14 macaques developed CE -specific 
cellular responses ranging from 0.03 –0.8% of CE -specific IFN -γ+ T lymphocytes in 
blood. All 7 CE were immunogenic  (range 1 -4 CE/animal ; Figure 4-12). This is in 
contrast to gag pDNA vaccinated macaques which induced CE -specific responses in 
~50% of animals targeting significantly fewer CE (range 0 -3 CE/animal).  
 
Figure 4-[ADDRESS_981714].  
p27CE pDNA vaccination elicited CE -specific T cells with a significant fraction of 
cytotoxic (IFN -γ+, granzyme B+, CD107a+) T cells  among both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell 
subsets. Thus, these findings mirror the data from HIV p24CE vaccine described in 
studies 2 and 3.  
Study 8 ( Table 4-1): Six of the macaques primed with SIV CE pDNA (from study 7) 
received a gag pDNA booster vaccination given with macaque IL-12 pDNA. The gag 
pDNA booster vaccination significantly increased th e magnitude of the CE -specific 
responses (p=0.031). These data recapi[INVESTIGATOR_719450] p24CE 
primed T cell responses upon a boost with HIV gag pDNA expressing the full -length 
protein (studies 3 and 4), demonstrating that the immunodomin ance hierarchy could be 
altered by [CONTACT_719511]. In addition, the responses after the SIV gag pDNA boost were 
significantly higher ( p=0.048) compared to the responses obtained after the p27CE 
pDNA priming vaccination, similar to observations from the HIV p24 CE prime -gag 
DNA boost studies (studies 4 and 5). The gag pDNA booster vaccination (study 8) 
resulted in recognition of 1 -4 CE per animal  with a similar response breadth as found in 
the p27CE pDNA only primed animals. Thus, gag pDNA booster vaccination inc reased 
the magnitude of the CE -specific responses without broadening CE recognition. 

HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 33 of 140 Therefore, SIV p27CE pDNA and HIV p24CE pDNA priming vaccinations share the 
unique feature of effectively inducing immune responses to subdominant Gag epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], 
which is o nly inefficiently achieved by [CONTACT_719512] -length 
SIV Gag or HIV Gag.  
Study 9 ( Table 4-1): A second vaccine concept was test ed in which macaques (N=6) 
received a single SIV p27CE pDNA priming vaccination followed by 3 booster 
vaccinations comprised of a co -delivered mixture of p27CE+ gag pDNA, plus macaque 
IL-[ADDRESS_981715] CE -specific responses, 
reaching up to ~1.8% IFN -+ T cells in blood. No further increase in magnitude of the 
responses was observed between the 2nd and the 3rd boost, demonstrating that two 
CE+gag pDNA booster vaccinations are sufficient to maximize the magnitude of the 
primed CE -specific responses using this vaccine regimen.  
Both booster vaccines ( gag pDNA and p27CE+ gag pDNA ) induced overall similar levels 
of CE -specific T cell responses (studies 8 and 9). However, the p27CE+ gag pDNA 
booster vaccination (study 9 ) significantly expanded  the breadth of CE-specific cellular 
responses ( Figure 4-13) to 4-7 CE per animal ( Figure 4-14).

Thus, the  detailed analysis of the responses to individual CE induced by [CONTACT_719513] (studies 8 and 9)  revealed a fundamental difference in 
breadth, although the magnitude of CE -specific T cell responses induced by [CONTACT_719514] i s similar.  
The frequency of the cytotoxic T cells ( granzyme B+) induced in the different CE -based 
vaccination regimens was also examined. Of note, gag pDNA vaccinated macaques 
which also developed CE -specific responses (N=18) showed significantly (p=0.014)  
higher frequency of granzyme B+ p27Gag-specific T cells than the ~50% of macaques 
(N=13) which failed to induce CE -specific responses ( Figure  4-15, left panel), suggesting 
that the T cells targeting the CE are functionally more cytotoxic than those targeting the 
variable regions. This notion is supported by [CONTACT_719515] 
p27CE pDNA was included  as prime induced significantly h igher frequency of cytotoxic 
T cell responses than those induced by [CONTACT_719516] (studies 2 -6) (Figure  
4-15, right panel).

Figure  4-15 Comparison of cyto toxicity of SIV Gag-specific T cell responses with different 
vaccine regimens. The frequency of Gag -specific granzyme  B+ IFN-+ T cell responses was 
measured in the different vaccine grou ps. Left panel: Macaques vaccinated with gag pDNA were 
grouped according to their ability to mount T cell responses recognizing CE. P value is from t -test. 
Right panel: The cytotoxicity of Gag responses is compared among all the gag pDNA vaccinated 
animals  and the animals which received a CE based pDNA vaccine (CE only, or CE prime -gag 
pDNA boost or CE prime - p27CE+ gag pDNA boost) (right panel). The median is in dicated. P 
values are from ANOVA (Dunnett’s test).  
Overall , priming with CE pDNA and boosting wit h a mixture of CE and gag pDNA is the 
most efficient protocol to induce CE responses with the broadest coverage, and the 
subdominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_719451] T cell responses of higher 
functional relevance (more cytotoxic). Data from bot h the macaques vaccinated with 
p27CE pDNA and the subset of gag DNA vaccinated animals which developed CE -
specific responses show a link between CE immunity and CTL responses. Thus, the use 
of CE pDNA priming vaccine is critical to efficiently induce potent CTL responses to 
subdominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].

IAVI has presented results of its B004 study, which also tested multiple injections of 
HIV-MAG and GENEVAX® IL-12-4532 DNA IM /EP (Ichor  TDS -IM EP Device ) in 
healthy volunteers  [7]. The study tested the groups shown in Table 4-3. The vaccine 
regimens tested were adequately safe with no SAEs or AEs that were probably or 
definitely related to vaccine. The vaccine regimens in the [ADDRESS_981722] to ce llular responses assessed by [CONTACT_20129] -γ ELISpot, at baseline there were no 
responders. After the 3 pDNA priming injections, response rates among vaccinees were 
82% (9/11) in Group 1, 64% (7/11) in Group 2, and 42% (5/12) in Group 3. After the 
Ad35 -GRIN/ENV boos t, response rates among vaccinees were 73% (8/11) in Group 1, 
82% (9/11) in Group 2, and 89% ( 8/9) in Group 3. Samples from 8 participants in each 
group were also assessed with 7 -color ICS to assess expression of IL -2, TNF -α, and 
IFN-γ in response to pepti des matched to the HIV -MAG vaccine. Groups 1-3 had similar 
CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell response rates and magnitudes, and the polyfunctionality profiles 
were similar. An ELISA assay for HIV -specific antibodies to Env A and Env B (matched 
to the HIV -MAG vaccine) a nd p24Gag did not detect any HIV -specific antibodies 
following the DNA primes in any group. In summary, the vaccine regimens tested were 
immunogenic, but there was no clear indication of enhancement of immunogenicity of 
HIV-MAG by [CONTACT_8668]-12 DNA in this small t rial. One shortcoming of this data is that the 
participants were not all evaluated for CD8+ responses with ICS. It is not clear how the 
specific participant samples were selected for ICS assay, or how responses would have 
differed if measured by [CONTACT_106885] l aboratory assays.

any significant systemic or local adverse effects related to the use of IL-[ADDRESS_981725] on CD8+ responses. IL-12 
pDNA has been given at doses up to 1 mg at a single injection site with IM /EP and up to

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981726] approximately 40% of each sex o verall. Hence, when approximately 
[ADDRESS_981727] study vaccination, all participants 
will provide some safety data. However, for immunogenicity analyses, it is possible that 
data may be missing for various reasons, such as participants terminating from the study 
early, problems in shippi[INVESTIGATOR_36406], low cell viability of processed peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PB MCs)  or high background . Immunogenicity data from 17 phase 1 
and 2 phase 2a HVTN vaccine trials, which began enrolling after June 2005 (data as of 
September 2014 ), indicate that 17% is a reasonable estimate for the rate of missing data 
at day 182. For this  reason, the sample size calculations in Section 6.1.[ADDRESS_981728] serious adverse events (SAEs) can be expressed by [CONTACT_588603] 1 SAE would likely be observed and the true event 
rate below which no events w ould likely be observed. Specifically, for each vaccine arm 
of the study (n = 25), there is a 90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate of 
such an event is 8.8% or more; and there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the 
true rate is 0. 4% or less. As a reference, in HVTN vaccine trials from December 2000 
through September 2010, about 4% of participants who received placebos experienced an 
SAE.  
Probabilities of observing 0, 1 or more, and 2 or more events among arms of size 25 are 
present ed in Table 6-1 for a range of possible true adverse event rates. These calculations

6.1.2  Sample size calculations for immunogenicity  
For comparing the CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell endpoints between the 2 vaccine regimens, 
the primary analysis uses head -to-head superiority comparisons. The comparison will be 
performed separately for each of the primary breadth and secondary magnitude T -cell 
subset endpoints. No m ultiplicity adjustments are made for the multiple comparisons 
given the utility to favor higher power at the expense of a higher accepted false positive 
rate. 
Figure 6-1 below summarizes power available for superiority testing. For th ese 
calculations, we assume 17% missing data (n=21 evaluable endpoints from each arm). 
Sample size calculations for breadth of response are based on data from the HVTN [ADDRESS_981730] 
deviation = 1. The assumptions for the sample size calculations for ICS magnitude are 
based on the data from the HVTN [ADDRESS_981731] with 2 -sided p -value <0.05 as statistically significant.  
If mean CE breadth in the vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175986] 1 is 0.2 (0.5) then the study has 
80% power to detect superiority in Group [ADDRESS_981732]

assignment.  
Emergency unblinding decisions will be made by [CONTACT_6962]. If time permits, 
the HVTN  PSRT should be consulted before emergency unblinding occurs.  
6.4 Statistical analys es 
This section describes the final study analys es, unblinded as to treatment arm  assignment.  
All data from enrolled participants will be analyzed according to the initial randomization 
assignment regardless of how many vaccinations they received. In the rare instance that a 
participant receives the wrong treatment at a specific vaccin ation time, the Statistical 
Analysis Plan will address how to analyze the participant’s safety data. A nalys es are 
modified intent -to-treat in that individuals who are randomized but not enrolled do not 
contribute data and hence are excluded. Because of bli nding and the brief length of time 
between randomization and enrollment —typi[INVESTIGATOR_106742] 4 working days —very 
few such individuals are expected.  
Analyses for primary endpoints will be performed using SAS and R. All other descriptive 
and inferential st atistical analyses will be performed using SAS, StatXact, or R statistical 
software.  
No formal multiple comparison adjustments will be employed for multiple safety 
endpoints, multiple primary immunogenicity endpoints, or secondary endpoints. 
However, multi plicity adjustments will be made for certain immunogenicity assays, as 
discussed below, when the assay endpoint is viewed as a collection of hypotheses (eg, 
testing multiple peptide pools to determine a positive response).

6.4.2  Baseline comparability  
Treatment arms will be compared for baseline participant characteristics using descriptive 
statistics . 
6.4.3  Safety/tolerability analysis  
Since enrollment is concurrent with receiving the first vaccination, all participants will 
have received at least 1 vaccination and therefore will provide some safety data.

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 49 of 140 [IP_ADDRESS]  Reactogenicity  
The number and percentage of particip ants experiencing each type of reactogenicity sign 
or symptom will be tabulated by [CONTACT_269913]. For a given sign or symptom, each participant’s 
reactogenicity will be counted once under the ma ximum severity for all injection visits. 
In addition, to the individual types of events, the maximum severity of local pain or 
tenderness, induration or erythema, and of systemic symptoms will be calculated. 
Kruskal -Wallis tests will be used to test for di fferences in severity between arms.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  AEs and SAEs  
AEs will be summarized using MedDRA System Organ Class and preferred terms. 
Tables will show by [CONTACT_269914] a System Organ Class or withi n preferred term category by 
[CONTACT_145661]. For the calculations in these tables, a 
participant with multiple AEs within a category will be counted once under the maximum 
severity or the strongest recorded causal relationship  to study product. Formal statistical 
testing comparing arms is not planned since interpretation of differences must rely 
heavily upon clinical judgment.  
A listing of SAEs reported to the DAIDS Regulatory Support Center (RSC) Safety Office 
will provide det ails of the events including severity, relationship to study product, time 
between onset and last vaccination, and number of vaccinations received. A separate 
listing will do the same for AEs of special interest (AESI). AESI for this protocol include 
but a re not limited to autoimmune disorders; a sample list of AESI is provided in  
Appendix G . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local laboratory values   
Box plot s of local laboratory values will be generated for baseline values and for values 
measured during the course of the study by [CONTACT_31703]. Each box plot  will 
show the first quartile, the median, and the third quartile. Outliers (values outside t he box 
plot) will also be plotted. If appropriate, horizontal lines representing boundaries for 
abnormal values will be plotted.  
For each local laboratory measure, summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_719527], as well as changes fro m baseline for post -enrollment values. In addition, 
the number (percentage) of participants with local laboratory values recorded as meeting 
Grade [ADDRESS_981738] -vaccination time point. Reportable clinical laboratory abnormalities without an 
associated clinical diagnosis will also be included in the tabulation of AEs described 
above.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reasons for v accination discontinuation and early study termination  
The number and percentage of participants who discontinue vaccination and who 
terminate the study early will be tabulated by [CONTACT_106867].

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 50 of 140 6.4.4  Immunogenicity analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General approach  
For the s tatistical analysis of immunogenicity endpoints, data from enrolled participants 
will be used according to the initial randomization assignment regardless of how many 
injections they received. Additional analyses may be performed, limited to participants 
who received all scheduled injections per protocol. Assay results that are unreliable, from 
specimens collected outside of the visit window, or from HIV -infected participants 
postinfection are excluded. Since the exact date of HIV infection is unknown, any assay 
data from blood draws 4 weeks prior to an infected participant’s last seronegative sample 
and thereafter may be excluded. If an HIV -infected participant does not have a 
seronegative sample postenrollment, then all data from that participant may be ex cluded 
from the analysis.  
Discrete categorical assay endpoints ( eg, response rates) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_719528]. Crude response rates will be presented 
with their corresponding 95% confidence interval estimates calculated using the score 
test method [92]. Because of the small numbe rs of control participants in each group, no 
adjustment will be made to the vaccine arm estimates for the false positive rates in the 
control arms. Fisher’s exact tests will be used to compare the response rates of any 2 
vaccine arms, with a significant di fference declared if the 2 -sided p -value is ≤ 0.05.  
For quantitative assay data (eg, percentage of positive cells from the ICS assay  or mean 
fluorescence intensity from the binding antibody multiplex assay ), graphical and tabular 
summaries of the distributions by [CONTACT_488], treatment arm, and timepoint will be made. For 
all primary and secondary immunogenicity endpoints, box plots and plots of estimated 
reverse cumulative distribution curves will be used for graphical display of all of the 
study arms. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the results will be shown for each vaccine arm and for the set of 
control arms pooled into one group.   
The difference s between treatment groups  at [ADDRESS_981739] underlying continuous or count -type readout s that are 
dichotomized into responder/nonresponder categories (eg,  ICS and BAMA ). If treatment 
arm differences for these assays are best summarized by a mixture model,  then 
Lachenbruch’s test statistic [93] will be used to evaluate the composite null hypothesis of 
equal response rates in the [ADDRESS_981740] statistic equals the square of a binomial Z -statistic for 
comparing the response rates plus the square of a Wilcoxon statistic for comparing th e 
response distributions in the subgroup of responders. A permutation procedure is used to 
obtain a 2 -sided p -value.  For estimation, differences in response rates between arms will 
be estimated using the methods described above, and in the subgroup of posi tive 
responders, differences in location parameters between arms will be estimated using the 
methods described above.   
More sophisticated analyses employing repeated measures methodology ( eg, linear mixed 
models  or marginal mean models fit by [CONTACT_719529] e stimating equations) may be utilized 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981741] for differences over 
time.  However, inference from such analyses would be limited by [CONTACT_355553]. All statistical tests will be  2-sided and will be considered statistically 
significant if p   0.05.  
Based upon previous HVTN trials, missing 17% of immunogenicity results for a specific 
assay is common due to study participants terminating from the study early, problems in 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_719455], or low cell viability of processed peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs). To achieve unbiased statistical estimation and inferences with standard 
methods applied in a complete -case manner (only including participants with observed 
data in the  analysis) , missing data need to be missing completely at random (MCAR). 
Following the most commonly used definition, MCAR assumes that the probability of an 
observation being missing does not depend on any participant characteristics (observed or 
unobserv ed). When missing data are minimal (specifically if no more than 20% of 
participants are missing any values), then standard complete -case methods will be used, 
because violations of the MCAR assumption will have little impact on the estimates and 
hypothesi s tests.  
If a substantial amount of immunogenicity data is missing for an endpoint (at least 1 
value missing from more than 20% of participants), then using the methods that require 
the MCAR assumption may give misleading results. In this situation, analy ses of the 
immunogenicity endpoints at a specific timepoint will be performed using parametric 
generalized linear models fit by [CONTACT_54683]. These methods provide unbiased 
estimation and inferences under the parametric modeling assumptions and the a ssumption 
that the missing data are missing at random (MAR). MAR assumes that the probability of 
an observation being missing may depend upon the observed responses and upon 
observed covariates, but not upon any unobserved factors. Generalized linear model s for 
response rates will use a binomial error distribution and for quantitative endpoints, a 
normal error distribution. For assessing repeated immunogenicity measurement, linear 
mixed effects models will be used. If the immunological outcomes are left - and/or right - 
censored, then the linear mixed effects models of Hughes [94] will be used, because they 
accommodate the censoring. In addition, secondary analyses of repeated immunogenicity 
measurements may be done using weighted GEE [95] methods, which are valid under 
MAR. All of the models described above in this paragraph will include as covariates all 
available baseline predictors of  the missing outcomes.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response as measured by [CONTACT_106875]4+ and CD8+ T-cell response rates as measured by [CONTACT_719530]. For eac h T-cell 
subset, the positivity call for each peptide pool  will include  a multiple comparison 
adjustment for the number of peptide pools used in the assay.  In general, the Mixture 
Models for Single -cell Assays (MIMOSA) statistical framework [96] and/or the Fisher’s 
exact test -based  positivity criteria will be used. Details of the positivity criteria will be 
discussed in the SAP. The magnitude of marginal response will be analyzed as described 
for quantitative  data in the general approach section. For each T -cell subset, graphs will 
be used to display the background -subtracted magnitudes for each participant by [CONTACT_109414], 
treatment arm and timepoint. Statistical testing comparing the magnitudes will be based 
on positive responders only.  The polyfunctionality of ICS responses will also b e analyzed 
as a secondary endpoint. Besides descriptive plots of the magnitude of polyfunctional 
responses, the COMPASS ( Com binatorial Polyfunctionality a nalysis of Antigen -Specific 
T-cell Subsets ) statistical framework will also be used to perform joint m odelling of

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 52 of 140 multiple T -cell subsets of different cytokine combinations using the functionality score 
(FS) and the polyfunctionality score (PFS) to summarize the multi -parameter ICS 
responses.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of multiplexed immunoassay data  
The analysis of respon se rates and response magnitudes will be evaluated and compared 
as described under the general approach . 
6.4.5  Analyses prior to end of scheduled follow -up visits  
Any analyses conducted prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits should not 
compromise the  integrity of the trial in terms of participant retention or safety or 
immunogenicity endpoint assessments. In particular, early unblinded analyses by 
[CONTACT_432194] a 
need to know basis o nly. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety  
During the course of the trial, unblinded analyses of safety data will be prepared 
approximately every [ADDRESS_981742] approve any other requests for 
unblinded safety data prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immu nogenicity  
An unblinded statistical analysis by [CONTACT_106882] a primary immunogenicity 
endpoint may be performed when all participants have completed the corresponding 
primary immunogenicity visit and data are available for analysis from at least  80% of 
these participants. Similarly, an unblinded statistical analysis by [CONTACT_106882] 
a secondary or exploratory immunogenicity endpoint may be performed when all 
participants have completed the corresponding immunogenicity visit and data are  
available for analysis from at least 80% of these participants. However, such analyses for 
a secondary or exploratory immunogenicity endpoint will only take place after at least 
one of the primary immunogenicity endpoints of the same class (humoral  or cell-
mediated) or, if no primary endpoint of the same class, at least one of the primary 
immunogenicity endpoints reaches the aforementioned threshold. The Laboratory 
Program will review the analysis report prior to distribution to the protocol chairs, 
DAIDS,  vaccine developer, and other key HVTN members and investigators. 
Distribution of reports will be limited to those with a need to know for the purpose of 
informing future trial -related decisions. The HVTN leadership must approve any other 
requests for HVTN  immunogenicity analyses prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up 
visits .

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 53 of 140 7 Selection and withdrawal of participants  
Participants will be healthy, HIV  uninfected (seronegative) adults who comprehend the 
purpose of the study and have provided written infor med consent. Volunteers will be 
recruited and screened; those determined to be eligible, based on the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in the study. Final eligibility determination will 
depend on results of laboratory tests, medical histo ry, physical examinations, and answers

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 59 of 140 7.3 Participant departure from vaccination schedule or withdrawal  
This section concerns an individual participant’s departure from the vaccination schedule. 
Pause rules for the trial as a whole are described in Section 11.4. 
For information on procedures following  EP difficulties, see Sections 9.3.1  and 9.3.2 . 
7.3.1  Delaying vaccinations for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, a participant’s scheduled vaccination will be delayed. The 
factors to be considered in such a decision include but are not limited to the following:  
 Within 45 days prior to any study injection   
 Receipt of b lood products or immunoglobulin  
 Within 30  days prior to any study injection  
 Receipt of l ive attenuated vaccines other than influenza vaccine  
 Receipt of a llergy treatment with antigen injections  
 Within 14 days prior to any study injection  
 Receipt of i nfluenza vaccine or any vaccines that ar e not live attenuated vaccines 
(eg, pneumococcal)  
 Pre-vaccination abnormal vital signs or clinical symptoms that may mask assessment 
of vaccine reaction.  
Vaccinations should not be administered outside the visit window period specified in the 
Study Specif ic Procedures.  
In order to avoid vaccination delays and missed vaccinations, participants who plan to 
receive licensed vaccines  or allergy treatments should be counseled to schedule receipt of 
these substances, when possible, outside the intervals indicate d above. The effects of 
these substances on safety and immunogenicity assessments and their interactions with 
study vaccines are unknown. Therefore, if circumstances allow, these substances should 
also be avoided in the [ADDRESS_981758] vaccination follow -up visit.  
7.3.2  Participant departure from vaccination schedule  
Every effort should be made to follow the vaccination schedule per the protocol. If a 
participant misses a vaccination and the visit wind ow period for the vaccination has 
passed, that vaccination cannot be given. The participant should be asked to continue 
study visits. The participant should resume the vaccination schedule with the next 
vaccination unless there are circumstances that requi re further delay or permanent 
discontinuation of vaccination (see Sections 7.3.1  and 7.3.3 ).  
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17 , 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 60 of 140 7.3.3  Discontinuing vaccination for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, an individual participant’s vaccinations will be permanently 
discontinued. Specific events that will result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a partici pant’s vaccination 
schedule include:  
 Co-enrollment in a study with an investigational research agent (rare exceptions 
allowing for the continuation of vaccinations may be granted with the unanimous 
consent of the HVTN PSRT).  
 Clinically significant conditio n (ie, a condition that affects the immune system or for 
which continued vaccinations and/or blood draws may pose additional risk), 
including but not limited to the following:  
 Pregnancy (regardless of outcome);  
 Any grade 4 local or systemic reactogenicity symptom, lab abnormality, or AE 
that is subsequently considered to be related to study products.  
 Any grade 3 lab abnormality or other clinical AE (exception: fever or vomiting 
and subjective local and systemic symptoms) that is subsequently considered to 
be related to study product s; or 
 Clinically significant type 1 hypersensitivity reaction associate d with study 
vaccination. Consultation with the HVTN PSRT is required prior to subsequent 
vaccinations following any type 1 hypersensitivity reaction associated with study 
vaccination; or  
 Investigator determination in consultation with Protocol Team leader ship (eg, for 
repeated nonadherence to study staff instructions).  
Such participants should be counseled on the importance of continuing with the study and 
strongly encouraged to participate in follow -up visits and protocol -related procedures per 
the protoc ol for the remainder of the trial, unless medically contraindicated.  
In addition, vaccinations will be stopped for participants diagnosed with HIV infection. 
HIV-infected participants will not con tinue in the trial (see Section  7.3.4 ). 
7.3.4  Participant termination from the study  
Under certain circumstances, an individual participant may be terminated from

The TDS -IM device will be used as directed by [CONTACT_550478], Inc. (Please refer 
to the TDS -IM User Manual for further instruction). The TDS -IM has three components: 
The TDS -IM Pulse Stimulator, the Integrated Applicator (reusable) and the Application 
Cartri dge (single -use). The Application Cartridge is the only patient contact [CONTACT_719541]. Only use Becton Dickin son 3.0 mL sterile syringe (BD# 309585, 309657,

The used TDS -IM Application Cartridge should be disposed of in accordance with 
institutional policy in the clinic. It should NOT be returned to pharmacy.  
To accommodate differences in skin thickness, a slidable depth control gauge allows 
adjustment of injection depth to one of three settings: 12, 17, or 22 millimeters (mm) 
from the skin surface. The corresponding depth of electrode insertion for these setti ngs is 
15, 20, and 25 mm respectively. Prior to applying the EP procedure, the participant’s skin 
to muscle thickness must be assessed for each arm separately. This may be assessed once, 
at any time prior to the first injection with EP for a participant, a nd is not required prior 
to each procedure. However the skin fold thickness should be reassessed for a participant 
whose body weight has changed by 10% since the previous skin fold thickness 
assessment. The skin fold thickness for each arm is recorded in t he participant study 
chart. The Application Cartridge penetration depth will be set prior to each procedure 
according to these measurements.  
To assess the thickness of the skin and subcutaneous tissue use your thumb and forefinger 
to “pi[INVESTIGATOR_820]” the skin and s ubcutaneous tissue overlying the muscle at the administration 
site together and measure the fold thickness using skin calipers or other suitable 
measurement devic e. Based on this measurement, use the chart below to select the 
appropriate depth setting on t he Application Cartridge for each arm. Record the skin fold 
thickness for each arm in the participant study chart. The selected depth setting on the 
Cartridge is indicated by [CONTACT_719542] (see  Table

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 73 of 140 9 Clinical procedures  
The schedu le of clinical procedures is shown in  Appendix F . 
9.1 Informed consent  
Informed consent is the process of working with participants so that they fully understand 
what will and may happen to them while participating in a research study.  The HVTN 
informed consent form documents that a participant (1) has been informed about the 
potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to participation, and (2) is willing to participate  
in an HVTN study. Informed consent encompasses all written or verbal study information 
HVTN CRS staff provide to the participant, before and during the trial. HVTN CRS staff 
will obtain informed consent of participants according to HVTN policies and proce dures.  
The informed consent process continues throughout the study. Key study concepts should 
be reviewed periodically with the participant and the review should be documented. At 
each study visit, HVTN CRS staff should consider reviewing the procedures an d 
requirements for that visit and for the remaining visits. Additionally, if any new 
information is learned that might affect the participants’ decisions to stay in the trial, this 
information will be shared with trial participants. If necessary, participa nts will be asked 
to sign revised informed consent forms.  
An HVTN CRS may employ recruitment efforts prior to the participant consenting. For 
example, some HVTN CRSs use a telephone script to prescreen people before they come 
to the clinic for a full scree ning visit. Participants must sign a screening or protocol -
specific consent before any procedures are performed to determine eligibility. HVTN 
CRSs must submit recruitment and prescreening materials to their IRB/EC and any 
applicable RE  for human subjects protection review and approval.  
Note: As defined in the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual, an RE is “Any group other 
than the local IRB/EC responsible for reviewing and/or approving a clinical research 
protocol and site -specific ICFs  [informed consent for ms] prior to implementation at a 
site.” CRSs are responsible for knowing the requirements of their applicable REs.  
 Screening consent form  9.1.[ADDRESS_981781] approval from their IRB/EC and any applicable RE  to use a 
general screening consent form that allows screening for an unspecified HIV vaccine 
trial. In this way, HVTN CRS st aff can continually screen potential participants and, 
when needed, proceed quickly to obtain protocol -specific enrollment consent. Sites 
conducting general screening or prescreening approved by [CONTACT_11577]/EC and any 
applicable RE  may use the results from t his screening to determine eligibility for this 
protocol, provided the tests are conducted within the time periods specified in the 
eligibility criteria.  
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 74 of 140  Protocol -specific consent forms  9.1.2
The protocol -specific consent forms describe the study products to be  used and all 
aspects of protocol participation, including screening and enrollment procedures. A 
sample protocol -specific consent form for the main study is located in Appendix A . A 
separate sample consent form for other uses of s pecimens is located in Appendix C . 
Each HVTN CRS is responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a protocol -specific consent form (s) for 
local use, based on the sample protocol -specific consent form s in Appen dix A  and 
Appendix C . The consent form (s) must be developed in accordance with requirements of 
the following:  
 CRS’s IRB/EC  and any applicable RE s, 
 CRS’s institution, and  
 Elements of informed consent as described in Title 45, CFR Part 46 and Title 21 
CFR, Part 50, and in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6, 
Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guid ance 4.8.  
Study sites are strongly encouraged to have their local CABs review their sites -specific 
consent forms. This review should include, but should not be limited to, issues of cultural 
competence, local language considerations, and the level of unde rstandability.  
The sample informed consent form includes instructions throughout the document for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_115539].  
Sites should follow the instructions in the Protocol -specific Official Memo distributed 
along with this protocol regarding when t hey may begin using their site -specific protocol 
consent forms.  
Regarding protocol registration, sites should follow procedures outlined in the current 
version of the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual.  
 Assessment of Understanding  9.1.[ADDRESS_981782] on the procedures and issues 
presented, and ans wering all questions completely.  
An Assessment of Understanding is used to document the participant’s understanding of 
key co ncepts in this HIV vaccine trial . The participant must complete the Assessment of 
Understanding before enrollment. Staff may provide assistance in reading and 
understanding the questions and responses, if necessary. Participants must verbalize 
understanding of all questions answered incorrectly. This process and the participant’s 
understanding of the key concepts should be recor ded in source documentation at the site.  
IRB/EC and any applicable RE  may require that a participant has signed either a 
screening or protocol -specific consent document prior to administering the Assessment of 
Understanding. The consent process (including the use of the Assessment of 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 75 of 140 Understanding) should be explained thoroughly to the IRB/EC and any applicable RE , 
whose recommendations should be followed.  
9.2 Pre-enrollment procedures  
Screening may occur over the course of several contacts/visits, up to and in cluding before 
vaccination on day 0. All inclusion and exclusion criteria must be assessed within 56 
days before enrollment, unless otherwise specified in the eligibility criteria (or below in 
this section).  
After the appropriate informed consent has been obtained and before enrollment, the 
following procedures are performed:  
 Medical history, documented in the case history record;  
 Assessment of whether the volunteer is at low risk for HIV infection;  
 Complete physical examination, including height, weight, vital signs, and clinical 
assessments of head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes; heart; chest; 
abdomen; extremities; neurological function; and skin;  
 Deltoid skin fold measurement (Section 8.4) 
 Assessment of concomitant medications the volunteer is taking, including 
prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, topi[INVESTIGATOR_49186], 
alternative/complementary medicines (eg, herbal and health food suppl ements), 
recreational drugs, vaccinations, and allergy shots;  
 Laboratory tests as defined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including:  
 Screening HIV test,  
 HBsAg,  
 Anti-HCV antibodies,  
 Syphilis test,  
 CBC with differential and platelets,  
 Chemistry pane l (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine , and CPK ), 
 Urine dipstick (as described in Section 9.8). and  
 Urine or serum pregnancy test (participants who were born  female)   
 Administration of behavioral risk assessment questionnaire;  
 Obtaining of volunteer demographics in compliance with the NIH Policy on 
Reporting Race and Ethnicity Data: Subjects in Clinical Research, Aug. 8, 2001 
(available at http://grants.nih.go v/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-01-053.ht mL); 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 76 of 140  Counseling on HIV testing and risk reduction, performed in compliance with the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s current guidelines or other local 
guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral as described in Section 9.6; and  
 Discussion of pregnancy prevention. A pregnant or breastfeeding person may not be 
enrolled in this trial. Specific cri teria and assessment of contraception and pregnancy 
status are described in study inclusion criteria. Discussion of pregnancy prevention 
includes advising a participant who was born female and who reports no current 
sexual activity that could lead to that participant becoming pregnant to have a plan to 
begin adequate birth control. This plan would be put to use if, during the study, the 
participant becomes sexually active in a way that could lead to that participant 
becoming pregnant.  
 Use of screening resu lts from another HVTN study  9.2.1
If a participant screens for an HVTN study at the same HVTN CRS but then does not join 
that study, screening results from that effort may be applied to the screening for this 
protocol, as long as the screening was done under par ticipant consent, the participant has 
signed a consent form to begin screening for this study, and the tests were conducted 
within the time periods specified in the eligibility criteria (see Sections 7.1 and 7.2). 
9.[ADDRESS_981783] vaccinati on. The time interval between 
randomization and enrollment should not exceed 4 working days. The HVTN CRS 
registers the participant by [CONTACT_432201] 0 visit (enrollment) via the Web -based 
randomization system, and requests the randomization assignment . Circumstances may 
require a participant’s enrollment visit to be changed. This may exceed the 4 -day 
randomization time limit.  
At all vaccination visits, the following procedures are performed before vaccination:  
 Abbreviated physical examination, includin g weight, vital signs, and a symptom -
directed evaluation by [CONTACT_106903]/or appropriate physical exam based on participant 
self-reported symptoms or complaints;  
 Assessment of baseline reactogenicity parameters;  
 Assessment of concomitant medications (as desc ribed in Section  9.2); 
 Assessment of any new or unresolved AEs/intercurrent illnesses; and  
 Urine or serum pregnancy test (for participants who were born female).  Persons who 
are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total hysterectomy  or 
bilateral oophorectomy  (verified by [CONTACT_30219]), are not required to undergo 
pregnancy testing.  
Following completion of all procedures in the preceding list , and if results indicate that 
vaccination may proceed, vaccination is prepared and administered (see Sections 8.3 and 
8.4). 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981784] be accomplished within 1 
calendar day.  
Immediately following vaccination, the participant re mains in the clinic for observation. 
Participant pain will be assessed using a Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) immediately 
following EP, then again 5 -7 minutes and 25 -60 minutes following vaccination  (as 
described in Section 9.9.3 ). An initial reactogenicity assessment is made at a target of [ADDRESS_981785] with the participant 
during the reactogenicity period (as described in Section  9.9). 
The following procedures will be performed at all vaccination visits. These procedures 
may be performed prior to or following vaccination:  
 Risk reduction counseling (as described in Section 9.6);  
 Pregnancy prevention assessment (as described in Section  9.2 and 9.7); and  
 Assessment of new or unresolved social impacts (site staff will ask participant about 
the status of any unresolved social impacts and if s/he has experie nced any new 
social impacts as a result of the trial participation).  
Additional procedures will be performed at scheduled visits as specified in  Appendix E  
and Appendix F :  
 Administration of the social impact assessment questionnaire (types of impacts 
assessed involve personal relationships, health insurance, life insurance,  educational 
or employment opportunities, housing, immigration, or travel);  
 Administration of a questionnaire that asks the participant about any HIV testing he 
or she may have received outside of the study. Participants will also be asked whether 
they bel ieve they received the active vaccine or the control;  
 HIV infection assessment including pre -test counseling. A subsequent follow -up 
contact [CONTACT_106905] -test counseling and to report results to 
participant;  
 Confirm that participants receiv ed HIV test results from previous visit. If not, provide 
test results and post -test counseling as appropriate; and  
 Specimen collection (should be completed prior to vaccination) . 
 EP device applied without vaccination  9.3.[ADDRESS_981786]  (vaccine or placebo) was received, 
and the participant is willing, additional attempts may be made within the vaccination 
window. For the Month [ADDRESS_981787] within 
4 days of randomization, unless a longer window is approved by [CONTACT_111153].  For 
subsequent timepoints, if a participant does not receive study agent (va ccine or placebo , 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 78 of 140 with or without EP ) in at least one arm within the vaccination window , that participant 
will have missed that vaccination.  
At the Month 0 visit, i f the participant had the Ichor TDS -IM EP device applied to the 
participant’s arm but the participant was not able to receive an y injection of study product 
at the enrollment  visit, the participant is not considered enrolled into the study , and is 
referred to as a “device -only participant” . Refer to the HVTN [ADDRESS_981788] ( ie, any volume of vaccine or placebo , with or without EP ) in at least one arm 
constitutes enrollment.  
The CRS staff should contact [CONTACT_541575] -only participant approximately [ADDRESS_981789] injection (ie, any volume of vaccine or placebo ) is given without EP  
due to human error or device malfunction , this event will be recorded/documented for 
that arm, and vaccinations should continue as scheduled.  
9.4 Follow -up visits  
The following procedures are performed at all scheduled follow -up vi sits: 
 Risk reduction counseling (as described in Section 9.6);  
 Pregnancy prevention assessment (as described in Section  9.2 and 9.7); and  
 Assessment of new or unresolved social impacts (site staff will ask participant about 
the status of any unresolved social impacts and if s/he has experienced any new 
social impacts as a result of the trial participation);  
 Assessment of new or continuing concomitant medications (as described in Section  
9.2); and  
 Assessment of new or unresolved AEs/intercurrent illnesses.  
Additional procedures will be performed at scheduled follow -up visits as specified in  
Appendix E  and Appendix F :  
 Administration of an EP acceptability questionnaire;  
 Administration of behavioral risk assessment questionnaire ; 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 79 of 140  Administration of th e social impact assessment questionnaire (types of impacts 
assessed involve personal relationships, health insurance, life insurance, educational 
or employment opportunities, housing, immigration, or travel);  
 Administration of a questionnaire that asks the  participant about any HIV testing he 
or she may have received outside of the study. Participants will also be asked whether 
they believe they received the active vaccine or the control;  
 HIV infection assessment including pre -test counseling. A subsequent follow -up 
contact [CONTACT_106905] -test counseling and to report results to 
participant;  
 Confirm that participants received HIV test results from previous visit. If not, provide 
test results and post -test counseling as appropriate;  
 Abbreviated physical examination including weight, vital signs, and a symptom -
directed evaluation by [CONTACT_106903]/or appropriate physical exam based on participant 
self-reported symptoms or complaints;  
 Complete physical examination, including weight, vital signs, and c linical 
assessments of head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes; heart; chest; 
abdomen; extremities; neurological function; and skin;  
 Specimen collection;  
 Clinical laboratory tests including:  
 CBC with differential,  
 Chemistry panel (see Section  9.2), and  
 Urine dipstick (urinalysis if appropriate; see Section 9.8); and  
 Urine or serum pregnancy test (for participants who were born female). Persons who 
are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total hysterectomy  or 
bilateral oophorectomy  (verified by [CONTACT_30219]), are not required to undergo 
pregnancy testing.  
9.[ADDRESS_981790] the 
information listed below. Clinic visits will only be required if HIV  confirmatory testing is 
necessary (see Section 9.6.1 ); however, a clinic visit may be arranged for other reasons.  
 Confirmation of vital status; if deceased, attem pt to learn cause and date of death  
 If participant is alive, record any of the following  events : 
 New AEs related to study product(s), including:  
o Life threatening adverse experiences;  
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 80 of 140 o Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_432137];  
o Other important medical events that may jeopardize the participant or 
may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed above;  
o New chronic conditions requiring more than 30 days of medical 
intervention or medication;  
o Other related  AEs.  
 AESI ( Section 11.2.2 ). A sample list of AESI is provided in  Appendix G . AESI 
are reported regardless of relationship to study product(s) ; 
 New diagnosis of HIV infection; and  
 Pregnancies and outcomes, including congenital anomalies/birth defects.  
All such events will be recorded and adverse  events will be assessed for relationship to 
study products. A safety monitoring team reviews reports from these contacts quarterly. 
This monitoring team comprises a DAIDS Medical Officer, Core medical monitor, and a 
clinical safety specialist (CSS). Other  questio ns may be added by [CONTACT_106885] [ADDRESS_981791] ing 
HIV counseling will be performed in compliance with the CDC’s guidelines or other 
local guidelines for HIV counseling and referral. HIV testing will be performed in 
accordance with the current HVTN HIV testing algorithm following enrollment.  
Participan ts will be counseled routinely during the trial on the avoidance of HIV infection 
and on the potential negative social impacts of testing antibody positive due to the 
vaccine. They will also be counseled on the risks of HIV antibody testing outside of the 
HVTN CRSs and will be discouraged from doing so during study participation and/or 
during any period of vaccine -induced positive serology.  
Study staff will take particular care to inform study participants of the likelihood of 
routine HIV testing being offe red or performed outside the study CRS at emergency 
rooms, clinics, and medical offices. Such testing has become more likely due to the 
CDC’s revised guidelines for HIV counseling and testing, as well as policy changes in 
many countries to make HIV testing  more frequent and routine. CRS staff should inform 
participants of their right to opt out of HIV testing outside the study site. CRS staff 
should inform study participants if local and/or state policies and regulations permit 
medical providers to perform HIV testing without first informing patients. If this is the 
case, then CRS staff should advise study participants that they may decline testing 
preemptively. CRS staff should also inform participants if positive results must be 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981792] may elicit an antibody response to HIV proteins. Therefore, vaccine -
induc ed positive serology may occur in this study. Several precautionary measures will 
be taken to distinguish intercurrent HIV infection from vaccine -induced positive 
serology. These precautionary measures include:  
 Participants will have physical examinations at visits specified in  Appendix F . Signs 
or symptoms of an acute HIV infection syndrome, an intercurrent illness consistent 
with HIV -1 infection, or probable HIV e xposure would prompt a diagnostic workup 
per the HVTN algorithm for Recent Exposure/Acute Infection Testing to determine 
HIV infection.  
 HIV testing will be performed at multiple timepoints throughout the study (see 
Appendix F ). The Laboratory Program (or approved diagnostic laboratory) will 
follow the HVTN HIV testing algorithm (as described in the HVTN Laboratory 
Manual of Operations ), which is able to distinguish vaccine -induced antibody 
responses from actual HIV infections.  
 All participants can receive HIV -[ADDRESS_981793] v accine -induced seropositivity.  
 All participants who received vaccine product and who have vaccine -induced 
positive or indeterminate HIV -1 serology (as measured by [CONTACT_106915] -HIV 
antibody screening tests) at or after the study is unblinded will be of fered poststudy 
HIV-1 diagnostic testing (per the HVTN poststudy HIV -1 testing algorithm) 
periodically and free of charge as medically/socially indicated (approximately every 
6 months)  unless or until HIV Ab testing is no longer the standard test in clinic al 
settings .  
 VISP registry  9.6.[ADDRESS_981794] kits. This is called “vaccine -induced 
seropositivity” (VISP) (see Section 9.6.1 ). In order to provide post -study HIV testing to 
distinguish between VISP and HIV infection, and to mitigate potential social harms 
resulting from VISP in HIV v accine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_432138], the HVTN 
has created a VISP registry. Following study unblinding, the registry will allow trained 
staff to verify that an individual has received an HIV vaccine, and therefore has the 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981795] that could cause that 
participant to become pregnant should be reminded at all scheduled clinic vis its of the 
importance of using contraception and should be referred to specific counseling, 
information, and advice as needed. (Specific contraception requirements are listed in 
Section  7.1). This reminder should be documented in the participant’s study record.  
Self-reported infertility —including having reached menopause (no menses for 1 year) or 
having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,  or tubal ligation —must be 
documented in the participant’s study record.  
9.8 Urinalysis  
Dipstick testing may be performed in the clinic or the lab, as long as the required 
elements (glucose, protein, and hemoglobin) are tested. The examination is performed on 
urine obtained by [CONTACT_106916].  
If the screening dipstick is transiently abnormal due to menses or infection, document this 
issue in the participant’s source documentation. For infection, provide appropriate 
treatment and/or referral. Following resolution, repeat the dipstick and, if within the 
eligibility limits specified in the protocol, the participant may be enrolled.  
Follow -up urinalysis should be deferred if a participant is menstruating, but should be 
performed as soon as possible. If a follow -up dips tick is abnormal due to a participant’s 
menstrual period, document in the comment section of the case report form (CRF) and 
repeat the dipstick once the participant is no longer menstruating. A micro -urinalysis is 
not required.

during the period between vaccination and the next scheduled visit. In general, a 
participant who self -reports any postvaccination reaction greater than mild is seen by a 
clinician with in 48 hours after onset, unless the reaction is improving and/or has 
completely resolved. Clinic staff will follow new or unresolved reactogenicity symptoms 
present at day 7 to resolution.  
Reactogenicity events are reported using CRFs that correspond to th e time of assessment 
in Table 9-1. Reactogenicity assessments include assessments of systemic and local 
symptoms, vaccine -related lesions, and lymph nodes. Events not listed on a CRF, or with 
an onset after the reactogenicity assessment period (day of vaccination and  7 full days 
after), or those meeting SAE/adverse events requiring expedited reporting to DAIDS 
criteria, are recorded on an adverse experience log form.

 Assessment of  systemic and local symptoms  9.9.1
Systemic symptoms include increased body temperature, malaise and/or fatigue, myalgia, 
headache, chills, arthralgia, nausea, and vomiting. Local symptoms include pain and/or 
tenderness proximal to the injection site. The daily maximum severity reached for each 
symptom during the assessment period is reported.  
Body temperature is measured by [CONTACT_432203]. If temperature is measured in Fahrenheit, the conversion to Celsius should be  
documented in the participant’s chart note. A measurement is taken once daily during the 
assessment period and should be repeated if participant is feeling feverish.  
 Assessment of injection site  9.9.2
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_106760]/ redness and induration/swelling. The 
maximum horizontal and maximum vertical measurements for all injection site reactions 
are recorded.  
All injection site reactions are monitored until resolution. Areas greater than 25 cm2 are 
followed daily; otherwise, the frequency o f follow -up is based on clinician judgment.  
 Visual Analog Scale (Pain Scale)  9.9.[ADDRESS_981798] descriptors at each end (“no pain” and “worst pain”). The VAS 
score is determined by [CONTACT_719544], 0 cm being no pain and 10 cm being maximum pain.   
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 84 of 140  Assessment of lymph nodes  9.9.4
This assessment is required only when reactogenicity assessments are performed by 
[CONTACT_432204], not by [CONTACT_2299].  
Only the proximally draining lymph nodes are assessed (eg, axillary nodes on the same 
side of the body for i njections given in the deltoid). Lymph nodes are first evaluated for 
enlargement and tenderness. If they are found to be enlarged, measurements are taken to 
determine the size (widest diameter) of the enlarged node(s).  
9.10 Visit windows and missed visits  
Visit  windows are defined in HVTN 119  Study Specific Procedures . For a visit not 
performed within the window period, a Missed Visit form is completed. If the missed 
visit is one that required safety assessments or local safety l abs, HVTN CRS staff should 
attempt to bring the participant in for an interim visit as soon as possible.  
Procedures performed at an interim visit are usually toxicity/safety assessments 
(including local safety labs) and HIV testing. With the exception of H IV testing, these 
procedures are performed only if they were required at the missed visit or if clinically 
indicated. HIV testing may be performed as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_5984]. Blood 
samples for immunogenicity assays are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_719461].  
If a missed visit required vaccination, please refer to Section  7.3.2  and Section  7.3.3  for 
resolution.  
9.11 Early termination visit  
In the event of early par ticipant termination, site staff should consider if the following 
assessments are appropriate: a final physical examination, clinical laboratory tests 
(including urine dipstick, CBC with differential, and chemistry panel), pregnancy testing, 
social impact assessment, and HIV test.  
9.[ADDRESS_981799] will be given, but remaining visits and study procedures should be 
completed unless medically contraindicated or appli cable  regulations require termination 
from the study. In case of required termination , enrollment in an observational study 
should be offered to the participant. If the participant terminates from the study prior to 
the pregnancy outcome, the site should m ake every effort to keep in touch with the 
participant in order to ascertain the pregnancy outcome.  Pregnancies and pregnancy 
outcomes will be reported.

minimal. The total blood volume drawn for each participant will not exceed 500  mL in 
any 56 -day (8 -week) period.  
10.3 Primary immunogenicity timepoint s 
The primary immunogenicity timepoint s in this study are at visit s 6 (day 42) (ie, 2 weeks 
after the 2nd vaccination visit)  and 11 (day 182) (i e, 2 weeks after the 4th vaccination 
visit) . Endpoint assays for humoral and cellular responses are performed on participants 
at the primary immunogenicity timepoint s and may be performed at baseline. Depending 
on the number of responders observed, assays for humoral and cellular responses may be 
performed on participants at other timepoints; the schedule is shown in Appendix E . 
10.4 Endpoint assays: cellular  
10.4.1  Flow cytometry  
Flow cytometry will be used to examine va ccine -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell 
responses following stimulation of PBMCs with synthetic HIV peptides that span the 
proteins encoded by [CONTACT_432205] , including pools covering individual CE 
regions . ICS parameters will include cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL -2, and TNF -α, and may 
include other cytokines  and phenotypic markers  to identify T cells of specific 
functionality (such as Th2 and T fh). Markers of cytotoxic potential ( eg, g ranzyme B ) 
must  also be included. Data will be reported as percentages of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 86 of 140 responding to a specific peptide pool. Additional cell surface markers, cytokines, or 
functional markers may also be analyzed.  
10.4.2  IFN-γ ELISpot (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_558580])  
Ex vivo  HIV-specific T -cells will be assessed by [CONTACT_20129] -γ ELISpot for epi[INVESTIGATOR_111050]. To 
this end, PBMCs will be stimulated overnight with synthetic peptide pools that span  the 
proteins encoded by [CONTACT_719545] , including separate pools containing only CE 
peptides . Samples with positive responses in this first round of testing will then be tested 
in a second round using individual peptides comprised in the pools to identify responses 
to individual epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. Data will be reported as the number of spot -formin g cells (SFC) 
per 106 cells recognizing a specific peptide or peptide pool.  
10.5 Endpoint assays: humoral  
10.5.1  HIV-1 multiplex antibody assay  
IgG antibodies to Clade B Gag and p24CE will be assessed on plasma/serum samples 
from study participants taken at the primar y immunogenicity timepoint and baseline. 
Specimens from other timepoints as well as other HIV antigens may also be assayed 
based on the results of the initial assay.   
10.6 Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_115542] (HLA) typi[INVESTIGATOR_115543], initially on specimens from 
participants who demonstrate vaccine -induced T -cell responses at post  vaccination 
timepoints. Other participants (including control recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) may be HLA -typed to 
support future studies of immunological interest at the discretion of the HVTN 
Laboratory Program. Other markers, such as genes associated with immune responses or 
HIV-1disease progression  may also be assessed .  
10.[ADDRESS_981801] genetics that may be conducted to determine endpoints 
in HVTN vaccine trials.  The type of assay(s) employed will be dependent on the response 
obtained by [CONTACT_382718] i mmunogenicity assays at relevant time points.  Please note that 
the Lab Assay Algorithm will be updated periodically to include new assays.  
10.8 Exploratory studies  
Samples may be used for other testing and research related to furthering the 
understanding of HIV  immunology or vaccines. In addition, cryopreserved samples may 
be used to perform additional assays to support standardization and validation of existing 
or newly developed methods.

HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 87 of 140  T-cell repertoire  10.8.1
Specimens collected at primary immunogenicity timepoi nts may be compared to those 
collected at baseline in order to examine evolution of vaccine -induced immune responses 
by [CONTACT_10840] -specific CD4+ T helper cells . Studies that can be performed include detailed T 
cell receptor alpha beta T cell receptor usage, mappi [INVESTIGATOR_719462] -specific responses after 
transfection of TCR alpha and beta chains into reporter cell lines, and transcriptome 
analysis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -specific T cells . 
10.9 Other use of stored specimens  
The HVTN stores specimens from all study participants indefinit ely, unless a participant 
requests that specimens be destroyed or if required by [CONTACT_1744]/EC, or RE.  
Other use of specimens is defined as studies not described in the protocol.  
This research may relate to HIV, vaccines, the immune system, and other diseases. Th is 
could include limited genetic testing and, potentially, genome -wide studies. This research 
is done only  to the extent authorized in each study site’s informed consent form, or as 
otherwise authorized under applicable law. Other testing on specimens will  occur only 
after review and approval by [CONTACT_106885], the IRB/EC of the researcher requesting the 
specimens, and the CRS’s IRBs/ECs if required.  
The protocol sample informed consent form is written so that the participant either 
explicitly allows or does not allow their samples to be used in other research when they 
sign the form. Participants who initially agree to other use of their samples may rescind 
their approval once they enter the study; such participants will remain in this study and 
their samples wil l only be used for the studies described in this protocol. If a participant 
decides against allowing other research using his or her samples, or at any time rescinds 
prior approval for such other use, the study site investigator or designee must notify 
HVT N Regulatory Affairs in writing. In either case, HVTN Regulatory Affairs directs the 
HVTN Lab Program not to use samples from these participants for such other uses.  
CRSs must notify HVTN Regulatory Affairs if institutional or local governmental 
requireme nts pose a conflict with or impose restrictions on other use of specimens.

sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigat ional study product/procedure(s), whether or not 
related to the investigational study product/procedure(s). All AEs are graded according to 
the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adul t and Pediatric Adverse 
Events , Version 2.0, November 201 4, available on the RSC website at http://rsc.tech -

 The grading of Insomnia events will consider the criteria within the Insomnia 
parameter as well as the general AE functional table  such that:  
 Grade 1 is: Mild difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up early 
causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional activities 
with intervention not indicated;  
 Grade 2 is: Moderate difficulty falling asleep, stayi ng asleep, or waking up early,

 Grade 3 is: Severe difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up early, 
causing inability to perform  usual social & functional activities with intervention 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374].  
If a definition of insomnia falls between 2 grades, the final grading will be selected based 
on the degree of interference with usual social and functional activities cau sed by [CONTACT_719546].  
All AEs are reported to the SDMC on the appropriate CRF. Clinic staff should evaluate 
every AE to determine if (1) the AE meets the requirements for expedited reporting to 
DAIDS ( Section  11.2.3 ) and (2) if the AE meets the criteria for a safety pause/prompt AE 
review ( Section  11.4) and (3) if the AE is an AESI. A sample list of AESI is provided as  
Appendix G . 
Sites are expected to notify the CSS  of any serious safety concern requiring  their 
attention (see Table 11-1). Telephone numbers and email addresses  are found  on the  
protocol home page on the HVTN Members’ site 
(https://members.hvtn.org/protocols/hvtn 119). Concerns requiring immediate attention 
should be communicated by [CONTACT_432211].  
In the case of email notification, the CSS  will reply during working hours (US Pacific 
Time) to confirm that t he email has been received and reviewed. If email service is not 
available, the HVTN CRS should notify the CSS  of the event by [CONTACT_756], then submit 
CRFs.  
In addition, site investigators are required to submit AE information in accordance with 
IRB/EC and any applicable RE  requirements.  
 Expedited reporting of adverse events to DAIDS  11.2.3
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of AEs are outlined in 
Version 2.0 (January 2010) of the Manual for Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events to 
DAIDS (DAIDS EAE Manual), which is available on the RSC website at  http://rsc.tech -
res.com/clinical -research -sites/safety -reporting . The SAE Reporting Category will be 
used for this  study.  
The internet -based DAIDS Adverse Experience  Reporting System (DAERS) must be 
used for expedited AE reporting to DAIDS. In the event of system outages or technical 
difficulties, expedited AE reports may be submitted via the DAIDS EAE Form. For 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981806]  [EMAIL_2104]  or from within the 
DAERS application itself.  
For questions about expedited AE reporting, please contact [CONTACT_138305] 
(DAIDSRSCSafetyOffice@tech -res.com ).  
The study products for which expedited reporting are required are :  
 p24CE1/2 pDNA or placebo  
 p55gag pDNA or placebo  
 IL-12 pDNA or placebo  
 Intramuscular TriGrid Delivery System (TDS -IM) electroporation device   
While the participant is in the main study reporting period (See Section  3), the SAE 
Reporting Category will be used.   
If the participant has completed the main study (visit 13, Month 12) and is in the  “follow -
up health contact” reporting period (see Section 3) the S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting Category will 
be used (In addition, please note, per Section 9.5, all adverse events that are serious are 
collected on the  month [ADDRESS_981807] Event Log and reported to SCHARP.)  
After the participant has completed the month [ADDRESS_981808] report S[LOCATION_003]RS if the study site staff becomes aware of the events on a passive 
basis (eg, from publicly  available information)  
The NIAID/DAIDS will report all unexpected SAEs related to the study products 
observed in this clinical trial to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (IND Safety 
Reports).  However, because safety is a primary study endpoint, the  Sponsor Medical 
Officer will not routinely be unblinded to study treatment assignment when there is an 
assessment of relatedness of the SAE with the study product(s); and the safety report will 
be sent to the FDA based on the blinded attribution assessmen t. 
If the PSRT believes unblinding of the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_269851], the PSRT will consult the independent HVTN SMB for 
a recommendation. In the event the HVTN SMB determines that unblinding is indi cated, 
the SMB will inform the site physician of the participant’s treatment assignment in such a 
manner as to maintain the study blind of the PSRT and study team. For additional impact 
and management of SAEs on the study, refer to Section  11.4.

When a trial is placed on safety pause, all enrollment and vaccination s will be held until 
further notice. The AEs  that will lead to a safety pause or prompt HVTN 119  PSRT AE 
review are summarized in Table 11-1. Vaccinations may be suspended for safety 
concerns other than those described in the table, or before pause rules are met, if, in the 
judgment of the HVTN 119  PSRT, participant safety may be threatened. Criteria for an 
individual participant’s d eparture from the schedule of vaccinations are listed in Section

For all saf ety pauses, HVTN Core notifies the HVTN 119  PSRT, HVTN Regulatory 
Affairs, DAIDS Pharmaceutical Affairs Branch (PAB), DAIDS Regulatory Affairs 
Branch (RAB), DAIDS Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team (SPT), and participating 
HVTN CRSs. When an immediate safety pause is triggered, HVTN Core notifies the 
SMB.  
Once a trial is paused, the HVTN 119  PSRT reviews safety data and decides whether the 
pause can be lifted or permanent discontinuation of vaccination is appropriate, consulting 
the SMB if necessary. HVTN Core  notifies the participating HVTN CRSs, HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS PAB, DAIDS RAB , and DAIDS SPT of the decision 
regarding resumption or discontinuation of study vaccinations. Based on the HVTN 119  
PSRT assessment, DAIDS RAB notifies the FDA as needed.  
If an immediate HVTN 119  PSRT notification or prompt HVTN 119  PSRT AE review is 
triggered, HVTN Core  notifies the HVTN 119  PSRT as soon as possible during working 
hours (US Pacific Time) —or, if the information w as received during off hours, by [CONTACT_432213]. If a prompt HVTN 119  PSRT AE review cannot be

an automatic safety pau se occurs.  
The HVTN requires that each CRS submit  to its IRB/EC and any applicable RE protocol -
related safety information (such as IND safety reports, notification of vaccine holds due 
to the pause rules, and notification of other unplanned safety pauses).  CRSs must also 
follow all applicable RE reporting requirements.  
In addition, all other AEs are reviewed routinely by [CONTACT_106885] 119  PSRT (see Section 
11.5.2 ). 
11.[ADDRESS_981810] s calls to review the data as appropriate. After the 
injections and the final 2 -week safety visits are completed, less frequent reporting and 
safety reviews may be conducted at the discretion of the HVTN 119  PSRT. HVTN Core  
reviews reports of clinical and laboratory AEs. Events identified during the review that 
are considered questionable, inconsistent, or unexplained are referred to the HVTN CRS 
clinic coordinator for verification.  
11.6 Study termination  
This study may be terminated early by [CONTACT_106936] 119  PSRT, a 
pertinent national regulatory authority, NIH, Office for Human Research Protections 
(OHRP), FDA, or vaccine developer(s).  In additi on, the conduct of this study at an

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or ask 
someone to read it to y ou. If you decide to join the study, we will ask you to sign or make 
your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will ask you questions to 
see if we have explained everything clearly. You can also ask us questions about the 
study.  
Researc h is not the same as treatment or medical care. The purpose of a research study is 
to answer scientific questions.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and [Insert site name]  are doing a study to 
test HIV vaccines.  HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  
About 56 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The researcher in charge of 
this study at this clinic is [Insert name [CONTACT_107002]] . The US National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) is payi ng for the study.  
This study is testing HIV vaccine s, and another study product called an adjuvant . The 
study will also test  an experimental device, called an electroporation (EP) device, which 
delivers these products with a small electrical pulse . We wil l explain  these terms in later 
section s. 
1. We are doing this study to answer several questions.  
 Are the study products safe to give to people?  
 Are people able to take the study products given with the EP device  without 
becoming too uncomfortable?  
 How do peo ple’s immune systems respond to the study products? (Your immune 
system protects you from disease.)  
2. The study products cannot give you HIV.  
The study products are not made from actual HIV. It is impossible for the study products 
to give you HIV. Also, they  cannot cause you to give HIV to someone else.  
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 113 of 140 3. We do not know if the study products will decrease, increase, or not change your 
risk of becoming infected with HIV if you are exposed to the virus.  
Sites: Any change to the language in this section requires a pproval from HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs.  
Several studies have tested whether HIV vaccines can reduce the risk of getting HIV 
from another person. In some studies, people who got the vaccine seemed to have the 
same  risk of getting HIV as people who did not get the vaccine. In one study, people who 
got the vaccine seemed to have a lower  risk of getting HIV than people who did not get 
the vaccine. In studies with a different vaccine, some people who got the vaccine ha d a 
higher  risk of getting HIV than people who did not get the vaccine.  
This study differs from the studies in which people who got the vaccine had a higher or 
lower risk of getting HIV. The study staff can tell you about the differences.  
We do not know whether the vaccines in this study will affect your risk of getting HIV 
from another person. The risk could be higher, lower, or unchanged. It’s very important 
to avoid exposure to HIV during and after the study. We will tell you how to avoid HIV.  
4. These st udy products are experimental.  
The study products are called p24CE1/2 vaccine, p55gag vaccine , and IL-12 pDNA 
adjuvant. From here on, we will call them “the study vaccines” and “the study adjuvant”. 
These study products are experimental. That means we do n ot know whether the study 
products will be safe to use in people, or whether they will work to prevent HIV 
infection. These study products are used only in research studies.  
There is also a placebo in this study. A placebo is a substance that does not con tain 
vaccine. The placebo for the study vaccines is sterile salt water.  
The study vaccines are provided by [CONTACT_106951] (DAIDS). The study adjuvant 
is provided by [CONTACT_719543], Inc.   
The study vaccine s are DNA vaccine s that contain DNA made in the laboratory. DNA is 
a natural substance in the body that tells the body to make proteins. Proteins are natural 
substances that the body uses to build and maintain itself , as well as protect itself against 
disease. The DNA in the stud y vaccine s tells the body to make protein s, or pi[INVESTIGATOR_719476] s, that are found in HIV. Your body’s immune system may respond to these 
proteins by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_719477]. Some of these 
immune cells make antibodies, w hich fight  infection . 
So far, experimental DNA vaccines in people have produced mostly weak immune 
responses. Sometimes vaccines work better when they are combined with another 
substance that helps to alert the immune system. These substances are called ad juvants. 
In this study, the study vaccines are always given with the study adjuvant.  The study 
adjuvant is made of DNA that tells the body to make IL-12, a normal protein in the body 
that helps immune cells work to gether and makes them multiply.  
One of the  study vaccines, the p24CE1/2 vaccine, has not been given to people before. It 
has been tested in mice and monkeys without causing health problems. Even if something 
looks like it is safe or works in animals, it may not be true for people.  
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981843] been given to about 300 people in 
4 different studies. Some of these studies also included the study adjuvant. No serious 
health problems were found that were related to those study products.  
General risks of vaccine s: 
All vaccines can cause fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, dizziness, 
and feeling tired. Vaccines can also cause pain, redness, swelling, or itching where you 
got the injection. Most people can still do their planned activities after  getting a vaccine. 
Rarely, people experience side effects that limit their normal activities or make them go 
to the doctor.  
Rarely, a vaccine can cause an allergic reaction, including a rash, hives, or difficulty 
breathing. Allergic reactions can be life -threatening. You should tell us if you have ever 
had a bad reaction to any injection or vaccine.  
Very rarely, a vaccine causes an autoimmune disease in a person, or makes an 
autoimmune disease worse. An autoimmune disease happens when your immune 
system  attacks your own body, instead of attacking an infection.  
Risks of the study products:  
This section lists the side effects of the study products that we know about. There may be 
others that we don’t yet know about, even serious ones. We will tell you if we l earn about 
any new sid e effects.  
The study vaccines and the study adjuvant are made with an anesthetic (a pain reliever) 
called bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_719478]. It is similar to the 
numbing medicine used by [CONTACT_103513]. Some people have  an allergy to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_719479]. For this 
reason we will ask if you have ever had an allergic reaction to one of these anesthetics 
before enrolling you in the study.  
Possible risks related to the study vaccines include muscle damage at the site of the 
injection, the production of antibodies which might react with normal body tissues and 
cause an autoimmune disease, and insertion of the study product’s DNA into the body’s 
DNA.  
Since 1995, thousands of people have received experimental DNA vaccines for diseases 
such as hepatitis, human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV, also known as genital warts), and HIV. 
In these people, the DNA vaccines have not caused serious side effects. We expect the  
risks of the study vaccines in this study to be similar to those of other DNA vaccines.  
In earlier studies of the study adjuvant  given at lower doses , there were no severe 
reactions or serious health problems. We do not know if participants in this study  will 
have similar experiences to those seen in earlier studies.  
However, with the study products, there may be new side effects that we don’t know 
about.  
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981844]  to improve immune responses to DNA vaccines is to use 
electroporation (EP). EP uses an electric pulse to briefly open tiny pores in the cells. The 
DNA can enter the cells through these pores. EP has been used for many years in the 
laboratory to get DNA or  other substances into cells. Recently, a study showed that EP 
increased immune responses to another experimental DNA vaccine.  
EP is done in this study using a device called the Intramuscular TriGrid Delivery  System . 
It was developed by [CONTACT_719553], Inc. From now on we will call it “the EP 
device.” EP in people is an experimental procedure, and the EP device is an experimental 
device. The EP device is only used in people in research studies.  The EP device gives an 
electrical pulse into the arm mus cle where the injection is given.   
This electrical pulse is delivered to the muscle through [ADDRESS_981845] time these particular study 
products will be given to people with EP.  
Risks of electroporation (EP):  
EP will cause brief muscle spasms  during the procedure. In previous studies using EP, 
people  felt initial pain t hat ranged from mild to severe. For most people , the pain eased 
quickly. EP can also cause soreness, a small amount of bleeding, bruising, redness, 
swelling, itching, or hardness/stiffness in the upper arm where you get the injection.  
Minor damage to muscle cells is also possible.  
Five percent of people (5%) felt lightheaded or faint after an injection with EP, and felt 
better after lying down. While uncommon, the EP device may cause infection  at the part 
of your body where you got the injection.  Rarely, people have reported numbnes s or a 
tingling sensation in their arm lasting several minutes. A standard injection with needle 
and syringe can also have these side effects.  
It is possible that the EP device may not work as expected, such as not giving the study 
products or placebo or the electrical pulse. If this happens, we may ask if we can try 
again.  
In one study, during a person’s first injection, the injection needle came in contact [CONTACT_719554], and the EP device was hard to remove, which caused severe pain and stress. A 
local anes thetic had to be  used to ease the removal. This  has happened  once,  in more than 
3500 injections using this EP device.   
Having the procedure or thinking about it may cause some stress and anxiety. If you feel 
anxious, please tell us and we will try to help you.  
Because EP could possibly interfere with implanted electronic medical devices such as 
pacemakers or defibrillators or make certain heart problems worse, we will ask whether 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981846] a history of irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias). We will also make su re you don’t 
have any metal implants in the upper part of your body.  
We do not know if EP will change the risks for any of the study products. We do not 
know all the risks of EP because it has only been used  in a limited number of people 
before this study and not with these study products . 
Joining the study  
6. It is completely up to you whether or not to join the study.  
Take your time in deciding. If it helps, talk to people you trust, such as your doctor, 
friends or family. If you decide not to join this stu dy, or if you leave it after you have 
joined, your other care at this clinic and the benefits or rights you would normally have 
will not be affected.  
If you join this study, you may not be allowed to join other HIV vaccine or HIV 
biomedical prevention stud ies now or in the future. You cannot be in this study while you 
are in another study where you get a study product. Also during the study, you should not 
donate blood or tissue.  
If you choose not to join this study, you may be able to join another study.  
Site: Remove item [ADDRESS_981847] and  health history. A physical exam may 
include, but is not limited to:  
 Checking your weight, temperature and blood pressure  
 Looking in your mouth and throat  
 Listening to your heart and lungs  
 Feeling your abdomen (stomach and liver)  
 Gently pi[INVESTIGATOR_719480] o f your upper arm to measure the skin thickness for EP 
injections  
We will also do blood and urine tests. These tests tell us about some aspects of your 
health, such as how healthy your kidneys, liver, and immune system are. We will also test 
you for hepatit is and syphilis. We will ask you about medications you are taking. We will 
ask you about behaviors that might put you at risk for getting HIV. If you were born 
female, we will test you for pregnancy.  
We will review the screening results with you. The scre ening results may show you are 
not eligible to join the study, even if you want to.

you got the stud y products or the placebo. This could be several years. But, if you have a 
serious medical problem and need to know what you got before the end of the study, we 
can tell you.  
13. We will give you the study products on a schedule.  
You will be in one of 2 groups . You will get 2 injections of the study products or placebo, 
one in each upper arm. This will happen 4 times during the study. All injections will be 
given with EP.

For all injections, the EP device is pressed against your upper arm firmly. You will feel 
some pressure against your arm. Once the EP device is set in place, the clinic staff will 
activate it and you will hear two clicks. At this point the needles are inse rted into your 
arm. For most people, this does not hurt but gives a sensation of pressure. After the 
needles have been inserted, there will be a [ADDRESS_981852].  
14. In addition to giving you the study products, we will:  
 Do reg ular HIV testing, as well as counseling on your results and on how to avoid 
getting HIV;  
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 120 of 140  Do physical exams;  
 Do pregnancy tests if you were born female;  
 Ask questions about your health, including medications you may be taking;  
 Ask questions about any personal problems or benefits you may have from being in 
the study;  
 Ask questions about your experience with EP; and   
 Take urine and blood samples.  
When we take blood, the amount will depend on the lab tests we need to do. It will be 
some amount between 10  mL and 3 36 mL (2 teaspoons to about 1 ½ cups). Your body 
will make new blood to replace the blood we take out.  
Site: You may want to add a sentence to the end of the previous paragraph 
contextualizing the blood volumes described (eg, “To compare, people w ho donate blood 
in the US can give a total of about 500 mL in an 8 -week period.”). Modify the example 
for cultural relevance and alter blood volumes as necessary.  
Site: Insert Appendix [#], Table of procedures (for informed consent fo rm) in this section 
or distribute it as a separate sheet if it is helpful to your study participants. You are not 
required to do either.  
We will be looking for side effects. We will review the results of these procedures and 
tests with you at your next vis it, or sooner if necessary. If any of the results are important 
to your health, we will tell you.  
15. We will counsel you on avoiding HIV infection.  
We will ask you personal questions about your HIV risk factors such as sexual behavior, 
alcohol, and drug use.  We will talk with you about ways to keep your risk of getting HIV 
low.  
16. We will test your samples for this study.  
We will send your samples (without your name) to labs approved by [CONTACT_432220], which are located in the [LOCATION_002]. Researcher s at these labs will test your 
samples to see how your immune system responds to the study products.  In rare cases, 
some of your samples may be sent to labs approved by [CONTACT_115639].  
Researchers may also do  genetic testing related to this study on your samples. Your genes 
are passed to you from your birth parents. They affect how you look and how your body 
works. The differences in people’s genes can help explain why some people get a disease 
while others do  not. These types of genetic tests involve some of your genes, not all of 
your genes (your genome). The researchers will study the genes related to the immune 
system and HIV and those that affect how people get HIV.

In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of them over 
time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
Tests done on your samples are for research purposes only. The labs will not give the 
results to you or this clinic, and the results will not become part of your study record.  
When your samples are no  longer needed for this study, the HVTN will continue to store 
them.

samples.”  
This section gives you information so you can decide if you want your extra samples and 
information used in other studies. You will mark your decision at the end of the f orm. If 
you have any questions, please ask.  
Do I have to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind after you 
sign this form. At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we have. Your 
decision will not affect your being i n this study or have any negative consequences here.   
Where are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place called a 
repository. Your samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the [LOCATION_002].  
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra samples 
will be stored. [Site: insert limits if your regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, there is 
no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever know who you 
are. 
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. They are 
not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for research purposes.  
Will the HVTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN may share your 
samples with other researchers. Once we share your samples and information, we will not 
be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and information? When a researcher wants to 
use your samples and/or information, their research plan must be approved by [CONTACT_106885]. 
Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC) will 
review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106954]’s IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert 
a sentence stating this. ] IRBs/EC s protect the rights and well -being of people in research.  
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 122 of 140 If the research plan is approved, the HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s 
location.   
What information is shared with other researchers? The samples and limited information 
will be label ed with a code number. Your name [CONTACT_107030]. 
However, some information that we share may be personal, such as your race, ethnicity, 
sex, health information from the study, and HIV status. We may share information about 
the study pr oduct you received and how your body responded to the study product.  
What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information? The studies 
will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other diseases.  
Researchers may also do gen etic testing on your samples.  
If you become HIV infected, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the virus 
found in your samples. The researchers will use this information to learn more about HIV 
and the study product(s).  
In some cases, research ers may take cells from your samples and grow more of them over 
time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.   
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome wide studies. In these studies, 
researchers will look at all of your gene s (your genome). The researchers compare the 
genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that could help them 
understand diseases. The researchers may put the information from the genome -wide 
studies into a protected database so that other  researchers can access it. Usually, no one 
would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a person. However, if another 
database exists that also has information on your genome and your name, someone might 
be able to compare the databases and identify you. If others found out, it could lead to 
discrimination or other problems. The risk of this is very small.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
 Researchers who use yo ur stored samples and limited information for other research  
 Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your samples or 
information  
 The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
 The people who work with the researcher  
All of these people will do their best to protect your information. The results of any new 
studies that use your extra samples or information may be published. No publication will 
use your name [CONTACT_107005].

Other Risks  
22. There are other risks to being in this study.  
This section describes the other risks and restrictions we know about. There may also be 
unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if w e learn anything new that may 
affect your willingness to stay in the study.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood and 
giving injections. These procedures can cause bruising, pain, fainting, soreness, redness, 
swelling, itching, a sore, bleeding, and (rarely) muscle damage or infection where you got 
the injection. Taking blood can cause a low blood cell count (anemia), making you feel 
tired.  
Personal problems/discrimination/tes ting HIV antibody positive:  
About 10 to 20% of people who join HVTN studies report personal problems or 
discrimination because of joining an HIV vaccine study. Family or friends may worry, 
get upset or angry, or assume that you are infected with HIV or at high risk and treat you 
unfairly as a result. Rarely, a person has lost a job because the study took too much time 
away from work, or because their employer thought they had HIV.  
The body makes antibodies to fight or prevent infection. Most vaccines cause  the body to 
make antibodies as a way of preventing infection. Your body may make antibodies to 
HIV because you received HIV study vaccines. The study vaccines may cause you to test 
positive on some types of HIV antibody tests, even if you are not infected  with HIV. This 
is called vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). VISP means that after you get the study 
vaccines, a routine HIV test done outside this clinic may say you have HIV, even if you 
don’t. For this reason, you should plan to get HIV tests only a t this clinic during the 
study. Our tests can tell the difference between true HIV infection and a positive result 
that is caused by [CONTACT_106985].  
If you have a positive test result caused by [CONTACT_106984], we can arrange 
free HIV te sting for as long as you need it. If this happens, we do not know how long you 
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_981857] negative at the end of the study and positive some time 
later, even though you don’t have HIV. This could happen if different HIV tests come 
into use. We will give you a phone number to call for more information.  
Site: Modify the following paragraph if applicable.   
If someone believes you are infected with HIV even if you are not, you could face 
discrimination and other problems. For example, in some countries, you could be denied 
medical or dental care, employment, insurance, a visa, or entry into the military. If you do 
have a positive HIV antibody test caused by [CONTACT_106985], you will not be able to 
donate blood or organs. Your family and friends may treat you differently. We will give 
you a brochure that tells you more  about testing HIV positive because of an HIV vaccine, 
and how you can avoid some of these problems.  
If you become pregnant during or after the study and have VISP, we don't know if the 
antibodies could be passed to your baby. We know that this happens wit h other vaccines, 
like tetanus vaccine. These antibodies from the mother are not a danger to the baby, and 
they go away over time. For most babies antibodies from the mother last for about six 
months.  
You should always tell the delivery staff if you have V ISP. However, you may still be 
tested for HIV using the antibody test when you deliver your baby. If your test is positive 
and the delivery staff believes you have an HIV infection, your baby [CONTACT_719555] . If this happens, we can arrange for you and 
the baby [CONTACT_106960] a test that can tell the difference between true HIV infection and a VISP 
result. If you or the baby [CONTACT_106961], we can arrange this testing for free for 
as long as it is needed.  
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask about your HIV risks, such as having sex and 
using drugs. Also, waiting for your HIV test results or other health test results could 
make you feel anxious. You could feel worried if your test result s show that you are 
infected with HIV. If you feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and we will try to 
help you.  
Risks of disclosure of your personal information:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk is v ery 
low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to someone who should 
not have it. If that happened, you could face discrimination, stress, and embarrassment. 
We can tell you more about how we will protect your personal information if  you would 
like it.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
The genetic testing could show you may be at risk for certain diseases. If others found 
out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. However, it is almost impossible

you. GINA keeps health insurance companies and employers from seeing results of 
genetic testing when deciding about giving you health insurance or offering you work. 
GINA does not help or protect you against discrimination by [CONTACT_106962], 
disability or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We do not know if the study vaccines will increase, decrease, or not change your risk of 
becoming infected with HIV if exposed. If you get infected with HIV, we do not know 
how the study vaccines might affect your HIV infection or how long it takes to develop 
AIDS.  
We do not know if getting these study vaccines will affect how you respond to any future 
approved HIV vaccine. It could be that a future HIV vaccine may not work as well for 
you because you got the study vaccines. Currently, no HIV vaccine has been approve d 
for use.  
We do not know how the study vaccines will affect a pregnant participant or a developi[INVESTIGATOR_432147].  
Benefits  
23. The study may not benefit you.  
We do not know whether getting the study products might benefit you in any way. 
However, being in the study might still help you in some ways. The counseling that you 
get as part of the study may help you avoid getting HIV. The lab tests and physical exams 
that you get while in this study might detect health problems you don’t yet know about.  
This study may hel p in the search for a vaccine to prevent HIV. However, if the study 
products or EP device later become approved and sold, there are no plans to share any 
money with you .  
Your rights and responsibilities  
24. If you join the study, you have rights and responsib ilities.  
You have many rights that we will respect. You also have responsibilities. We list these 
in the Participant’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. We will give you a copy of it.  
Leaving the study  
25. Tell us if you decide to leave the study.  
You are free to leave the study at any time and for any reason. Your care at this clinic and 
your legal rights will not be affected, but it is important for you to let us know.

care that we cannot provide, we will explain how we will help you get care elsewhere.  
If you become sick or inju red in this study, there is a process to decide if it is related to 
the study products, EP device and/or procedures. If it is, we call it a study -related injury. 
There are funds to pay for treatment of study -related injuries if certain conditions are met.  
The HVTN has limited funds to pay medical costs that it determines are reasonable.  
There may be other ways that study -related injuries can be funded. We can give you more 
information, if you would like. (Sites: insert locale - appropriate medical insurance  
language in the following sentence) If the injury is not study related, then you and your 
health insurance will be responsible for treatment costs.  
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by [CONTACT_719556]. Or you might lose wages because you cannot go to work. 
However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if they are study 
related.  
You may disagree with the decision about whether your injury is study related. If you 
wish, the HVTN will ask independent experts to review the decision. You always have 
the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied.

HVTN protocol number: HVTN 119  
Site: [Insert site name]  
When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to kee p them for use 
in other studies. We will call these “extra samples.”  
This form gives you information so you can decide if you want your extra samples and 
information used in other studies. You will mark your decision at the end of the form. If 
you have any  questions, please ask.  
1. Do I have to agree?  
No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind after you sign this form . At 
your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we have. Your decision will not affect 
your being in this study or have any negative consequences here.   
2. Where are the samples stored?  
Extra samples are stored in a secure central place called a repository. Your samples will 
be stored in the HVTN repository in the [LOCATION_002].  
3. How long will the samples be stored?  
Ther e is no limit on how long your extra samples will be stored.  [Site: insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
4. Will I be paid for the use of my samples?  
No. Also, a researcher may make a new scientific discovery or product based on the use 
of your samples. If this happens, there is no plan to share any money with you. The 
researcher is not likely to ever know who you are.  
5. Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies?  
Probably not. Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your 
doctor. They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
research purposes.  
6. Will the HVTN sell my samples and information?  
No, but the HVTN may share your samples with other researchers. Once we share your 
samples  and information , we will not be able to get them back.  
HVTN 119, Version1.0  / February 17, 2017  
HVTN119_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 133 of 140 7. How do other researchers get my samples and information?  
When a researcher wants to use your samples and/or information, their research plan 
must be approved by [CONTACT_106885]. Al so, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) 
or ethics committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106954]’s 
IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs protect the rights 
and well -being of people in research. If the research plan is approved, the HVTN will 
send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
8. What information is shared with other researchers?  
The samples and limited information will be labeled with a code number. Your name [CONTACT_719560] p art of the information. However, some information that we share may be 
personal, such as your race, ethnicity, gender, health information from the study, and HIV 
status. We may share information about the study product you received and how your 
body respon ded to the study product.  
9. What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information?  
 The studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing related to this study on your  samples.  
If you become HIV infected, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the virus 
found in your samples. The researchers will use this information to learn more about HIV 
and the study product(s).  
In some cases, researchers may take cells f rom your samples and grow more of them over 
time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome wide studies. In these studies, 
researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers compare the 
genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that could help them 
understand diseases. The researchers may put the information from the genome -wide 
studies into a protected database so that other researchers can acce ss it. Usually, no one 
would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a person. However, if another 
database exists that also has information on your genome and your name, someone might 
be able to compare the databases and identify you. If othe rs found out, it could lead to 
discrimination or other problems. The risk of this is very small.  
10. What are the risks of genetic testing?  
The genetic testing could show you may be at risk for certain diseases. If others found 
out, it could lead to discrimin ation or other problems. However, it is almost impossible 
for you or others to know your test results from the genetic testing. The results are not 
part of your study records and are not given to you.   
In the very unlikely event that your genetic informati on becomes linked to your name, a 
federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) helps protect 
you. GINA keeps health insurance companies and employers from seeing results of 
genetic testing when deciding about giving you health in surance or offering you work.

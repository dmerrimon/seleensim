 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
2.1 Disease  
Diabetic retinopathy (DR)  is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes and is the 
leading cause of vis ion loss among working age adults in developed countries ( Solomon et al., 
2017).  Approximately one -third of patients with DR or up to ~7-10% of diabetics have diabetic 
macular edema (DME) which is characterized by [CONTACT_760219] t he central visual loss experienced in the diabet ic 
population ( Ding and Wong, 2012;  Lee et al., 2015) .  A review of the natural history of DME showed 
~50% of eyes lost ≥ 2 lines of visual acuity over two -years, while in the Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) a third of untreated eyes with center -involved DME experienced ≥ 15 
letter decrease in visual acuity in 3 years  (Ferris and Patz, 1984; EDTRS report No.4, 1987) .  With 
the increasing prevalence of diabetes worldwide, vision loss from DME represents a significant public health issue with considerable socioeconomic burden ( Kiss et al., 2016).  
Factors associated with increased risk of DR include diabetes duration, hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] ( Klein et al., 1994; Klein et al., 2010 ; Lee et al., 2015; Solomon et al., 2017).  While 
management of diabetes with control  of blood glucose, blood pressure, and serum lipid levels in 
conjunction with scheduled eye examinations can delay the onset and progression of DR and decrease the risk of vision loss, a significant proportion of those affected with diabetes will develop DME or proliferative changes that require intervention. ( [LOCATION_006] prospective diabetes study group, 1998; 
Chew et al., 2010).  
Central involved DME is classified as retinal thickening including edema in the macula affecting the 
central subfield region that is 1 mm in diameter.  The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to 
DME are multifactorial, complex and still to be fully elucidated.  However, it is known that hyperglyc emia can cause vascular endothelial damage and induce microvascular leakage 
secondary to breakdown of the inner blood- retinal barrier which leads to thickening or swelling of the 
macula and potential loss of sight if the edema involves the center  of the fovea ( Klaassen et al., 
2013) .  In addition, ischemia secondary to capi[INVESTIGATOR_211650]- perfusion, caused by [CONTACT_760220] -A (VEGF -A) which is a major 
contributor to neovascularization, vascular permeability and may also have pro- inflammatory 
properties ( Aiello et al., 1994;  Senger et al., 1990 ; Ishida et al., 2003).  Expression of VEGF -A and 
its receptor, VEGFR -2, have been shown to be greater in diabetic than non- diabetic retinal tissues in 
humans and VEGFR -2 is concentrated in microvascular epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], including those in the 
macula  (Sun et al., 2014; Witmer et al., 2002 ; Zhao et al., 2007) .  Ocular levels of inflammatory 
factors which are also regulated and produced by [CONTACT_760221]:  OPT -302 
Protocol Number:  OPT -302-1003  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1041038] 2018  Page 17 of 103 
 DME indicating an important role for inflammation in the disease process  (Shin et al., 2014 ; 
Kocabora et al., 2016).  
The treatment of central -involved DME has markedly changed over the last decade, from the 
primary use of focal  / grid laser photocoagulation, to the current era of intravitreal pharmacotherapy 
including anti -VEGF -A agents and corticosteroids.  The role of VE GF-A in the pathophysiology of 
retinal diseases, including wet age- related macular degeneration and DME, has led to the 
breakthrough development of several inhibitor drugs that target this ligand.  The positive clinical data 
and approval of these drugs have validated the importance of the VEGF family of ligands and 
receptors in the pathogenesis of DR and DME.   
Following the regulatory approval of aflibercept  (Eylea®; Regeneron) , and ranibizumab (Lucentis®; 
Genentech) , as well as the off -label use of bevaci zumab  (Avastin®, Genentech) , the treatment 
landscape has significantly altered for patients and currently anti -VEGF -A therapy is the first-line 
standard of care for central -involved DME  (Jampol et al., 2014) .  Aflibercept is a soluble decoy 
receptor fusion protein created using Trap technology, which targets VEGF -A, placental growth 
factor (PI[INVESTIGATOR_12252]) and VEGF -B (Regeneron, BLA 125387 , 2011).  The DA VINCI, VISTA and VIVID 
studies demonstrated that treatment with aflibercept yielded greater visual gains than macular laser 
treatment  in patients with central involved DME (Korobelnik et al., 2014;  Payne and Clarke, 2015) .  
The binding affinity of aflibercept to VEGF- A is substantially greater than that of ranibizumab and 
bevacizumab to VEGF -A, potentially allowing for a less frequent dosing regimen (once every 8 
weeks) following an initial monthly loading dose phase ( Stewart a nd Rosenfeld, 2008).   
Recent data from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) Protocol T  
comparing all three anti -VEGF -A drugs, indicated that at 1 year for eyes with centr al-involved DME, 
each agent improved visual acuity (VA) ( Wells et al., 2015) .  There was no difference among the 
three agents in mean change in VA in eyes with baseline vision  of 20/32 to 20/40, whereas 
aflibercept had more effective vision outcomes in eyes with baseline VA of 20/50 to 20/320 (Wells et 
al., 2015) .  At 2 years, aflibercept remained superior to bevacizumab, but not ranibizumab, among 
eyes with baseline VA of 20/50 or worse, while all three drugs had similar safety profiles  (Wells et 
al., 2015;  Cai and Bressler, 2017) .  Most patients with central involved DME require near -monthly 
administration of intravitreal  therapy with these anti -VEGF -A agents during the first 12 months of 
treatment, with f ewer injections needed in subsequent years to maintain clinical benefit ( Solomon et 
al., 2017). 
Intravitreous steroid therapy has also been evaluated in pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] [ADDRESS_1041039]:  OPT -302 
Protocol Number:  OPT -302-1003  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1041040] shown some treatment benefit with intravitreal 
corticosteroids ( Schwartz et al., 2016; Regillo et al ., 2017).  However, as intravitreal corticosteroids 
are associated with high rates of ocular adverse events including cataract progression and 
intraocular pressure elevation, switching to corticosteroids from an anti-VEGF -A agent with a sub-
optimal response needs to be carefully considered in patients with glaucoma and in young phakic 
patients ( Shah et al., 2017 ).  Steroids are therefore prefer red in pseudophakic eyes that have 
chronic / persistent or recurrent disease.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_760186] -A in the management of retinal disorders 
including DME, there is still room for improvement as many patients demonstrate a sub- optimal 
response, remain treatment refractory, or require frequent injections for persistent leakage in the 
macula.  A substantial prop ortion of patients with central involved DME do not show reductions in 
fluid or clinically significant improvement in visual acuity following anti -VEGF -A treatment ( Nguyen et 
al, 2012; Channa et al., 2014; Do et al ., 2013).  This resistance may occur as treatment selective 
anti-VEGF -A monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_760187].  Thus potential combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_760188]  (Campochiaro et al., 2016; 
Kaiser , 2017). 
2.2 OPT-302 Background  
2.2.1  Vascular endothelial growth factors C and D  
The VEGF -C and VEGF -D members of the VEGF family of secreted glycoproteins are upregulated 
in response to inhibition of VEGF -A with aflibercept or bevacizumab ( Cabral et al., 2016;  Lieu et al ., 
2013; Li et al., 2014; Rose et al., 2010; Fan et al., 2011; Grau et al., 2011).  Such upregulation may 
be an important mechanism contributing to clin ical sub -responsiveness reported with VEGF -A 
inhibitors.  Both VEGF -C and VEGF -D induce angiogenic vessel growth in several in vivo  models, 
while VEGF -C can also cause the formation of endothelial cell fenestrations, which increases 
vascular permeability ( Cao et al., 1998; Witzenbichler et al., 1998; Chung et al., 2009; Stacker et al., 
2001).  
VEGF-C contributes to increased vascular permeability and/or retinal angiogenesis through 
downstream effects of VEGFR -2 and VEGFR -3 activation ( Tammela et al., 2011; Joukov et al., 
1998; Joukov et al., 1997; Cao et al., 2004 ; Gaal et al., 2013;  Xu et al., 2013).  Expression of 
VEGFR -2 is greater in human diabetic retina than in non- diabetics and the receptor is concentrated 
in micr ovascular endothelial cells including those in the macula region ( Witmer et al., 2002;  Sun et 
al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2007 ).  Furthermore, VEGF- C can potentiate the an giogenic act ions of VEGF -

 A as it’s binding to VEG FR-2 inhibits apoptosis of microvascular endothelial cells induced by [CONTACT_33906]-
inflammatory cytokine tumor  necrosis factor and hyperglycemia ( Zhao et al., 2006 ; Zhao et al., 
2007).  There is also an increase in VEGF -C and VE GF-A mRNA in microvascular endothelial cells 
of individuals with diabetes ( Zhao et al., 2007).  Evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
diabeti c patients found that genetic variation within the VEGF -C gene is associated with DR and 
DME indicating that VEGF -C and its interaction with VEGFR -2 may play a functional role in the 
pathogenesis of these diseases ( Kaidonis et al., 2015).  
2.2.2  OPT-302 
OPT-302 is a recombinant fusion protein comprising immunoglobulin- like domains 1- 3 of the 
extracellular domain of human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor -3 (VEGFR -3) and the Fc 
fragment of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1).  It functions by [CONTACT_760222] -C and VEGF- D on endogenous VEGFR -[ADDRESS_1041042] been investigated in a number of in vitro  and in 
vivo studies.  These studies confirm the selective binding of OPT -302 to, and inhibition of, VEGF -C 
and VEGF -D, but not VEGF -A or placenta growth factor (PI[INVESTIGATOR_12252]).  Pre- clinical pharmacology studies 
of an OPT- 302 analogue (VGX -300) in the las er-induced choroidal neovascularization mouse model , 
demonstrated that targeted inhibition of VEGF -C/D has significant efficacy when used alone or in 
combination with aflibercept anti -VEGF -A therapy ( Lashkari et al., 2014).  
The biological effects to induce angiogenesis by [CONTACT_12270] -C and VEGF -D or vascular permeability  by 
[CONTACT_12270] -C, as well as the compensatory upregulation of these two ligands which  can occur when 
VEGF -A is inhibited, support the clinical investigation of OPT -[ADDRESS_1041043]:  OPT -302

2.3.1  Safety and tolerability  
OPT-302 has demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability up to 2 mg administered by [CONTACT_760223] 4 weeks either alone or in combination with the anti -VEGF -A therapy, ranibizumab (0.5 
mg), in a Phase [ADDRESS_1041047] in human (FIH) study (OPT -302-1001) in 51 patients with nAMD .  The Phase 
1 study consisted of two parts: Part 1 was an open- label, sequential dose escalation (n=20; 0.3, 1 or 
2 mg OPT- 302 with 0.5 mg ranibizumab, or 2 mg OPT -302 monotherapy, in 4 cohorts of 5 patients  
each); Part 2 was a randomized  dose expansion (n=31, 2 mg OPT -302 with 0.5 mg ranibizumab 
[n=23] or 2 mg OPT -302 monotherapy [n=8]).  All study drugs  were administered by [CONTACT_760224]:  OPT -302

Date:  [ADDRESS_1041048] 2018  Page 23 of 103 
 three consecutive dosing cycles at 4 weekly intervals.  Of the 51 patients enrolled, 19 (37%) were 
male , 32 (63%) were female, 10 ( 20%) had diabetes mellitus and 25 (49%) were treatment naïve, 
while 26 ( 51%) had received ≥ 3 prior IVT injections of anti -VEGF -A therapy . 
No dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed with OPT-302 at any IVT dose level up to 2 mg 
either in combination with anti -VEGF -A therapy or as a monotherapy, and the MTD  was not reached.

Overall,  100% of evaluable participants at Week 12 (n=49) maintained BCVA, defined as ≤15 letter 
loss from baseline.   In addition, changes from baseline in anatomic measures (CST) on SD -OCT 
through to week 12, demonstrated no adverse safety signals in treatment naïve patients and those 
who showed a sub- optimal response to prior anti -VEGF -A therapy.

 In summary, OPT -302 was well tolerated at doses up to 2 mg when administered by [CONTACT_760225] 4 weeks , either in combination with anti-VEGF -A therapy (0.5 mg 
ranibizumab ) or as a monotherapy.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
2.[ADDRESS_1041050] an acceptable risk benefit profile with acceptable safety and 
tolerability  in participants  with central involved DME . 
The other study drug to be used in the study is  aflibercept  which has been approved and is widely 
used globally for retinal vascular diseases including  central involved DME .  Overall, IVT aflibercept is 
a highly effective and safe therapy for improving vision and reducing vision loss in patients with 
DME.  Cumulative safety data to date do not show an increased risk of any ocular or systemic 
adverse events with this anti -VEGF -A agent compared to other similar drugs used to treat these 
indications  (Wells et al., 2015 ; Wells et al., 2016) .  There is therefore no additional risk to the use of 
this drug over and above standard care and the participants would likely be treated in the clinic with 
IVT injections of aflibercept or a similar anti -VEGF -A agent, even if not enrolled in this study

controlled clinical trials, > 35 % of patients with DME  treated with anti -VEGF -A therapy fail to achieve 
≥ [ADDRESS_1041052] ≥ [ADDRESS_1041053] complete resolution of retinal thickening (< [ADDRESS_1041054]) by 2 years ( Elman et al., 2011; Rajendram et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2012).   
In addition, data suggest that sub- optimally responding eyes may be identified after as few as 3 anti -
VEGF inje ctions and should be considered for alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Gonzalez et al., 2016).  A post 
hoc analysis of the DRCR network Protocol I study showed that ~40% of eyes had a poor mean 
BCVA response of < 5 letter gain from baseline , while ~ 23% of eyes showed a moderate mean VA 
gain of 5 - 9 letters from baseline after 3 monthly injections of ranibizumab, and both groups then 
only achieved a further mean VA improvement of < 3 letters at 1 and 3 years ( Gonzalez et al., 2016).  
Within the subset of patients with a poor BCVA of < 5 letter at 12 weeks, a minority of eyes (23%) 
continuing to receive regular monthly anti- VEGF -A therapy slowly improved t heir response to at least 
a 10 letter gain from baseline at 52 weeks ( Gonzalez et al., 2016) .   
Tolerance or tachyphylaxis, differences in drug levels between patients and resistance have all been 
proposed as potential reasons for suboptimal results in retinal diseases treated with anti -VEG F-A

 therapy  (Schaal et al., 2008; Eghoj and Sorensen 2012) .  Various reasons for this, including 
differences in individual VEGF- A gene expression, up-regulation of alternative factors and pathways,  
and a shift to chronic inflammation mechanisms have been implicated ( Forooghian et al., 2011) .  To 
overcome this suboptimal response, strategies involving more intensive dosing regimens or 
switching drugs within the same anti-VEGF -A pharmacologic group have  been used with alternative 
anti-VEGF -A agents  reportedly showing  further anatomic improvements but limited changes in VA  
(Lim et al ., 2015; Rahimy et al., 2016;  Spooner  et al., 2017; Mira et al., 2017).   However, many of 
these studies have either been retrospective and / or employ varied methodologies including 
differing retreatment regimens, variable entry criteria and non- standardized VA measurements.  
Thus, refractory eyes responding sub-optimally to first -line therapy characterized by [CONTACT_760226]/or poor gains in VA represent a therapeutic challenge with a high unmet medical  need.  
Since treatment selective anti -VEGF -A monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_760189] , potential adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_760190] ( Campochiaro et al., 2016; Kaiser, 2017).   Increased 
levels of the ligands VEGF -C/D upregulated in response to inhibition of VEGF -A with aflibercept or 
bevacizumab may represent an alternate mechanism contributing to sub- responsiveness reported 
with VEGF -A inhibitors  (Cabral et al., 2016; Lieu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Rose et al., 2010 ; Fan 
et al., 2011; Grau et al., 2011 ).  In the Phase 1 FIH study (OPT -302-1001), nAMD patients (n=19) 
showing a sub -optimal response to prior IVT anti -VEGF -A therapy (mean number of prior injections 
= 17 [range 3 to 76] ), and subsequently receiving combination OPT -302 with ranibizumab for 3 
monthly IVT injections, had a change from baseline to week 12 in mean BCVA of +4.[ADDRESS_1041056] of -54 µm.  A total of 10/19 ( 53%) of these patients receiving c ombination 
OPT-302 with ranibizumab had a ≥ 5 letter gain from baseline at week 12 in BCVA despi[INVESTIGATOR_760191]-VEGF -A therapy.  
OPT-302 which blocks the alternative VEGF- C/D angiogenesis and vascular leakage ligand 
pathways , therefore represents a novel therapeutic candidate to be used in combination with the 
anti-VEGF -A inhibitor, aflibercept as a potential treatment of center involved DME .

OPT-302 in combination with aflibercept will be investigated in the Phase 1b / 2a study.  The pre-
specified nominal doses of OPT -[ADDRESS_1041057]:  OPT -302

 • Cohort 3: [ADDRESS_1041060] of care IVT 
aflibercept  retreatment will be based on protocol -specified retreatment criteria for persistent DME if 
visual acuity (VA) or central subfield thickness (CST) on SD-OCT worsens (defined as a ≥ 10% 
decrease increase in CST or a ≥ [ADDRESS_1041061] study treatment phase visit [Day 
57]).   
Dose escalation cohorts in the Phase 1b will enroll sequentially, starting with cohort 1.   
 
 
 
At least [ADDRESS_1041062] 
complete the 14 day DLT period at each dose level before the data review team can consider dose 
escalation.   
 
 
3.1.3  P hase 2a – Randomized Dose Expansion  
The Phase 2a randomi zed dose expansion will begin dependent upon agreement by [CONTACT_760229] 1b  dose escalation phase (once 
all participants have completed the 14 day DLT window).   
In the Phase 2a, at least 108 participants  will be assigned randomly in a 2:1 ratio to one of the 
following two treatment groups:  
• Cohort 4: 2 mg aflibercept + OPT- 302 ( at MTD or highest dose tested from the P hase 1b) 
• Cohort 5: a flibercept + sham  
Cohort 4 will dose a minimum of  72 participants  using IVT aflibercept (2 mg in 0.05 mL) in 
combination with OPT- 302 (0.05 mL) at the MTD or highest tested dose from the Phase 1b, given 
once every 4 weeks ( Day 1, 29 and 57) for a total of 3 sequential injections.  
Cohort 5 will dose a minimum of 36 participants  with IVT aflibercept (2 mg in 0.05 mL) + sham once 
every 4 weeks ( Day 1, 29 and 57) for a total of 3 injections.   Randomization to cohorts 4 and 5 will 
continue until 72 evaluable participants  are available in the aflibercept + OPT -302 experimental arm.  
The OPT- 302 IVT injection (or sham) is given sequentially after IVT aflibercept by [CONTACT_760230] a post injection safety check has been performed (which will include a

Participants  will have a further [ADDRESS_1041064]

In the Phase 2a randomized dose expansion the investigator ophthalmologist and VA examiners will be “masked” to the individual treatment assignments.  Evaluation of SD- OCT scans, color fundus 
photographs and FA images will be performed by a masked observer, unaware of participant  
treatment assignment, both at the site and at the Independent Reading Center.  
The overall study design is described by a study design and treatment schema  at the end of the 
protocol synopsis section.  
3.2 Number of Centers  
The study will be conducted at up to ~25-[ADDRESS_1041066] 9 adult participants  ≥ [ADDRESS_1041067] 108  participants  will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to two treatment groups of  (i) OPT-[ADDRESS_1041068] dose tested

 3.4 Estimated Study Duration  
It is estimated that the study duration for participants in the active treatment phase will be 6 months 
consisting of 14 days  for screening, 2 months of treatment (at Day 1, 29 and 57) depending on 
tolerability to afliber cept ± OPT-302 (or sham) and week 12 and 24 follow -up visit s.  For the study 
participants who enter the run- in phase, there will be an additional ~4 to 6 weeks prior to entry into 
the active treatment phase.

6.6.3  Determination of Adverse Event Severity and Relatedness  
Determination of the severity of adverse events will be consistent with Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.  If the  adverse event  is not specified in CTCAE, then the severity 
will be assessed on a standard adverse event  scoring system .  The relationship 
of an adverse event to investigational product will be determined by [CONTACT_093]. An event 
should be considered related to treatment if, in the Investigator’s medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_760237]- [ADDRESS_1041098]:  OPT -302

9. SAFETY
 DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that all adverse events and other clinically 
significant findings that occur during the clinical study are documented and reported accurately.  
9.1 Adverse Events 
9.1.1  Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is  defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject.  The 
event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any AEs observed or reported by [CONTACT_760247] a pre- existing medical condition.  Worsening indicates 
the pre- existing medical condition ( e.g., diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in 
severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome.  An AE does  not include: medical / surgical procedures (but the condition that leads to the procedure 
may be and AE; situation where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760207]); overdose of study drug(s) or concomitant medication that does 
not result in any signs or symptoms (if signs or symptoms are present, then will be recorded as an AE); or underlying disease progression (DME in the study e ye). 
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE that was not present prior to treatment with 
the study drug(s), or an event that was present prior to treatment, but worsens either in intensity or 
frequency following treatment.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1041124] that 
occur after signing of the informed consent throughout the study until the final study visit  are 
reported.    
 
 
   
At each visit, the investigator /  delegate will determine whether any AEs have occurred.   
 
 

Product:  OPT -302 
Protocol Number:  OPT -302-1003  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1041125] 2018  Page 61 of 103 
  
 
 
 
If known,
 the medical diagnosis of an adverse event should be recorded in preference to the listing 
of individual signs and symptoms.  The investigator will evaluate any changes in laboratory values if 
laborat ory testing is performed, and make a determination as to whether or not the change is 
clinically important to be reported as an adverse event, and whether or not the changes were related to the study drug(s) .  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on 
the investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as AEs.  However, laboratory value changes 
that the investigator considers clinically significant or requir ing treatment / adjustment in current 
therapy are considered AEs.  Where applicable, the clinical sequelae (not the laboratory 
abnormality) should be recorded as the adverse event.  
Every adverse event must be assessed and the eCRF entry reviewed and confirmed by [CONTACT_093].  
All ocular AEs should indicate which eye the adverse event  occurred ( Oculus sinister ( OS) [left], 
oculus dextrus ( OD) [right], oculus uterque ( OU) [both]). 
The investigator has overall responsibility to ensure that the following adverse event attributes  are 
assigned: 
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms)  
• Dates of onset and resolution  
• Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol]  
• Assessment of relatedness to study drug(s)  
• Action taken 
If any AEs are present when a participant completes the study or when a participant is discontinued 
from the study, the Investigator  / delegate should make every effort to follow -up the participant until 
the adverse event has resolved or stabiliz ed.  All follow -up information (and attempted follow -up 
contacts) should be documented in the participant’s medical records.  
If an adverse event changes in severity, it should be a single entry in the eCRF, and assigned the highest severity experienced.   The adverse event toxicity grading scale used will be the National 
Institutes of H ealth Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4) .   
If the adverse event is not specified in the CTCAE, the severity will be assessed on the following scale with appropriate clinical definitions:  

Product:  OPT -302 
Protocol Number:  OPT -302-1003  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1041126] 2018  Page 63 of 103 
 Medically significant AEs considered related to the study drug(s) by [CONTACT_760248].  
9.2 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined by [CONTACT_760249] (ICH) as 
any noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product related to any dose.  Therefore, it is 
any AE where there is reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the study drug(s) and 
the AE.  An unexpected ADR is defined as an ADR, the nature, severity or frequency of which, is not 
consistent with the applicable drug information (i.e. not listed in the investigator’s brochure for OPT -
[ADDRESS_1041127] characteristics for aflibercept ). 
9.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
A suspected unexpected serious drug reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is defined as a SAE that is suspected to be 
an ADR, but is not consistent with the information as provided in the Investigators’ Brochure - i.e. 
either is not listed as an expected ADR in the I nvestigator’s Brochure, occurred at a greater severity 
than was listed, or there is an increase in the rate of occurrence that i s judged to be clinically 
important.  All S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be reported to the applicable regulatory agencies within the timelines as stipulated by [CONTACT_760250], and reported to each IRB / IEC  by [CONTACT_760251].  
9.4 Serious Adverse Events  
9.4.1  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that meets at least one of the following serious 
criteria:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening;  
• Requires in- participant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity; 
• Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect;  
• Is an important medical event.  
Death is an outcome of a SAE, and not a SAE in itself.  All deaths must be reported for participants 
on study and for deaths occurring within [ADDRESS_1041128] study drug(s) administration or within [ADDRESS_1041129] study evaluation, whichever is longer, to  
ensure immediate  reporting to all appropriate regulatory bodies within the required 
timelines  as applicable.  The Investigator should provide any additional requested information as 
available ( e.g. autopsy reports and terminal medical reports).  The term “life- threatening” in the 

Product:  OPT -302 
Protocol Number:  OPT -302-1003  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1041130] 2018  Page 64 of 103 
 definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the participant was at immediate risk of death at the 
time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760208], or the participant’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148581].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_586393] a pre- existing 
condition or for normal disease management procedures ( e.g. chemotherapy) will not be cons idered 
a SAE.  
 
 
 
  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] , prolonging  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174717] ≥ [ADDRESS_1041131] that occur after signing of the informed consent through the week 24 follow -up visit are 
recorded in the participant ’s medical record .  Any SAE (including death) that occurs during the 
course of the study, whether or not related to the study drug(s) due to any cause, must be reported immediately on the SAE form (within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event)  
  
  
The i nvestigator (or designee) will be requested to complete the SAE form 
 associated with the study 
including as much information regarding the event that is available at the time of the initial report.   
 
 
 
The inves t
igator must review and sign- off each SAE report to confirm that they have

Additional details on  endpoints will be included in the statistical analysis p lan. 
10.2.4  Analysis Subsets  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Intent -to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set   
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) analysis set s will include all participants enrolled (Phase 1b) or randomi zed 
(Phase 2a) into the study, irrespective of whether study drug(s)  was administered or not. These 
analysis set s will be used to report participant disposition and to provide a sensitivity analysis of the 
safety and efficacy endp oints only.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set s will comprise all participants in the ITT analysis set s, but excluding those 
not receiv ing at least one dose of study drug(s)  (aflibercept or OPT- 302). These  analysis set s will be 
employed to determine the safety endpoints.  Note that this population includes the ‘unevaluable’ 
participants (see per protocol population below) in the Phase 2a that received at least one 
administration of study drugs.  

Product:  OPT -302 
Protocol Number:  OPT -302-1003  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1041142] 2018  Page 68 of 103 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Dose E scalation  Analysis Set  
The analysis of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be conducted on t he Phase 1b dose escalation 
analysis s et defined as all DLT evaluable participants . A participant  is classified as DLT-evaluable if 
they have had the opportunity to complete the DLT interval (Days 1 to 14) and received [ADDRESS_1041143] 14 days on study .   
 
   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Per-Protocol Analysis Set  
The Per -Protocol (PP) analysis set s will comprise participants in the safety dataset who were 
compliant with study medication, and who are considered sufficiently compliant with the protocol. 
The participants pertaining to the PP dataset s are considered ‘evaluable’ participants. Efficacy 
analyses performed using the PP dataset s will be considered as primary analysis.  The PP analysis 
sets are intended to represent the subset of participants who were in the intended study population, 
received the intended study medication (a total of 3 scheduled IVT injections once every 4 weeks) , 
and could be evaluated for study outcomes.   
10.2.[ADDRESS_1041144]  108 additional participants  are expected to be treated in the Phase 2a ( dose 
expansion) with OPT -[ADDRESS_1041145] dose tested from the Phase 1b , in combination with 
aflibercept (72 participants ) or with aflibercept alone (36 participants) . 
Increasing numbers of participants  will be exposed in the various phases of the trial:  
• In the Phase 1b dose escalation, if 3 participants  will be treated with OPT -302 per cohort 
(without dose limiting toxicity), a total of at least 9 participants  will be treated in this phase of 
the trial.  
• In the Phase 2a dose expansion, [ADDRESS_1041146] dose level  of OPT -302 (determined from the Phase 1b) .  In case one or more of 
these [ADDRESS_1041147]:  OPT -302 
Protocol Number:  OPT -302-1003  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1041148] 2018  Page 69 of 103 
 • A total of up to at least 81 participants  receiving OPT -302 is anticipated to be enrolled in the 
trial ( 9 in Phase 1b and 72 in Phase 2a).  
The table below shows the true proportion of patients with an AE that can be ruled out at various 
confidence levels, assuming no such event is observed in the trial.  
Number of participants  
without adverse event  Confidence level  
80% 90% 95% 
3 0.48 0.57 0.63 
9 0.24 0.30 0.35 
81* 0.04 0.05 0.06 
* If more than 72 participants are randomized to the experimental arm (aflibercept + OPT -302) in Phase 2a, the 
confidence levels of the total group of participants receiving OPT -302 will be higher than N=81 . 
In the Phase 2a dose expansion, subjects  will be allo cated in a 2:1 ratio to one of two treatment 
groups, aflibercept with OPT -302 or aflibercept with sham, with minimization for two baseline 
characteristics: BCVA (≤ 55 vs. > 55 letters) and CST (≤ 450 vs. > 450 µm).  The primary outcome of 
the Phase 2a is the proportion of evaluable patients  with a response of ≥ 5 letter gain in BCVA from 
baseline to week 12 according to ETDRS criteria in the combination aflibercept + OPT -302 group.  
The design of the trial is non- comparative in so far as the sample size is calculated for the aflibercept 
+ OPT -302 arm only. A one- stage design is used for the primary outcome ( Sargent 2001) of the 
aflibercept + OPT -302 arm. A formal rule allows for the assessment of the observed response rate 
as compar ed with pre- specified “low” and high response rates.  Specifically, the hypotheses of 
interest are H0: r ≤ r0 (“low” response rate) against  HA: r ≥ rA (“high”  response rate).  
The following assumptions were made for sample size calculations:  
o the pre- specified “low” and “high” response rates are r 0 = 0.2 8 and rA = 0.45  
o the type I error  rate (α, probability of accepting  a treatment whose  true response  rate is lower  
than r0, a false  positive  outcome)  is set to 5% 
o the type II error rate  (ß, probability of rejecting a treatment whose  true response rate is 
higher  than rA, a false  negative  outcome)  is set to 5% 
o the probability  of correctly rejecting a treatment  whose  true response  rate is lower than  
r0 is set to at least  90% 
o the probability  of correctly accepting  a treatment  whose  true response  rate is higher  
than rA is set to at least 90%  
Under these assumptions, a total of 72 evaluable subjects  need to be randomized to the aflibercept 
+ OPT -302 arm. With the 2:[ADDRESS_1041149] 108 subjects  is randomized 
between aflibercept + OPT -302 (n= 72) or aflibercept + sham  (n=36). Non -evaluable particip ants will

 be replaced.  The conclusions based on the results of 72 evaluable participants in the combination 
aflibercept + OPT -302 arm will be: 
• clinical activity  if ≥ [ADDRESS_1041151] a ≥ 5 letter gain in BCVA from baseline to week 12 
according to ETDRS criteria in the aflibercept + OPT -302 group  
• insufficient clinical activity  if ≤ [ADDRESS_1041152] a ≥ 5 letter gain in BCVA from baseline 
to week 12 according to ETDRS criteria in the aflibercept + OPT -[ADDRESS_1041153] Treatment Assignments  
The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Phase 1b open label dose escalation and P hase 2a  
randomized dose expansion.  P articipants  in this study will either receive aflibercept  + OPT -302, or 
aflibercept  + sham .  The Phase 2a is a double- masked trial. The sponsor, investigator, VA assessor, 
imaging readers and subject will be masked to the treatment to which the subject was randomized.

10.6 Statistical Analysis Plan 
A final statistical analysis plan will be developed and approved by [CONTACT_760256].  The primary efficacy analysis will occur when target enrollment or randomization is complete and each participant  either completes the week 12 follow -up visit or 
withdraws from the study. The final analysis for all other endpoints will occur after all participants complete the week 24 follow -up visit.  
 
 
 The following is a summary of the planned analyses ; full 
details are captured in the statistical analysis plan . 
Continuous variables will be summari zed using descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum), while categorical variables will be summari zed as counts and 
percentages of participants in each category.  Results will be presented by [CONTACT_760257].  
The primary efficacy analysis will be presented using the PP analysis set.  Secondary efficacy analyse s will be presented using the PP and ITT populations. For efficacy analyses, no missing 
values will be imputed as the primary efficacy analysis is on the PP population. Safety analyses will 
be presented using the safety and ITT populations.  
All baseline and demographic summaries will be based on the ITT dataset . 
10.7 Planned Methods of Analysis of Key Study Endpoints  
10.7.1  Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the Phase 2a is the proportion of evaluable participants  (i.e. in the 
PP set) with a response o f ≥ 5 letter gain in BCVA from baseline to week 12 according to ETDRS 
criteria in the combination aflibercept + OPT -302 group.  Based on the results of 72 evaluable 
participants in the aflibercept + OPT -[ADDRESS_1041157]

in BCVA from baseline to week 12 according to ETDRS criteria in the aflibercept + OPT -[ADDRESS_1041161]:  OPT -302 
Protocol Number:  OPT -302-1003  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1041162] 2018  Page 72 of 103 
 The difference in the mean change from baseline to week 12 between treatments will be tested for 
three secondary efficacy endpoints: mean BCVA, mean CST and mean macular volume .  A model 
for repeated measures, fitted by [CONTACT_760258], will be used for the analysis.  This model takes into account the presence of missing data and yields valid estimates under the assumption of data missing at random.   
 
In addition, the following secondary outcomes will be estimated in the Phase 2a by [CONTACT_2939] , 
and their 95% confi dence intervals w ill be obtained:  
• Percent of eyes with ≥ 50% reduction in excess foveal thickness from baseline to week [ADDRESS_1041163]  
• Percent of eyes with CST < [ADDRESS_1041164]  through week 12  
• Percent of participants  with a ≥ 2 step improvement from baseline to week 12 in ETDRS 
Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Score  
• The mean time to, and number of, retreatment injections of aflibercept anti -VEGF -A therapy 
based on protocol specified criteria during week 12 to week 24 f ollow -up 
Further details of the analysis methods will be provided in the statistical analysis plan . 
10.7.2  Safety Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
All safety summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_760259].  The extent of 
exposure to study medication will be quantified using total dose (mg), number of doses, and duration of exposure (days).  Total dose and duration of exposure will be summari zed using descriptive 
statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum); number of doses and duration of exposure will be presented by [CONTACT_33335]. Percent compliance and the number of missed doses will be summari zed using descriptive statistics. Compliance will also be 
presented according to range categories and summari zed by [CONTACT_33335].  
The number of participants reporting AEs and TEAEs will be summa rized by [CONTACT_39812]; a participant will only be counted once per system organ class and once per preferred term within a study arm.  Participant counts and percentages and event counts will be presented for each study arm by [CONTACT_760260], ocular AEs and 
non-ocular AEs for the following summaries: all TEAE , all SAEs, all TEAE  by [CONTACT_764], all 
TEAE  by [CONTACT_92254], all TEAE  related to study medication.  
Participant listings  will also be presented for all AEs as well as for SAEs leading to discontinuation 
from the study and AEs leading to discontinuation from study medication.  These listings will include 
study arm and study period along with variables describing the nature, duration, and resolution of the event.

drug(s) are administered.  A legally acceptable representative is an individual or other body 
authorized under applicable law to consent, on behalf of a prospective subject, to the subject’s 
participation in the clinical study.   
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if they have a primary care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed of their  participation in the 
clinical study.  If the subject agrees to such notification, the investigator shall inform the subject’s 
primary care physician of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject does not have 
a primary care physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator should 
document such in the subject’s medical record.   The original signed informed consent form should 
be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form should be provided to the subject or legally acceptable representative.  
If a potential subject is illiterate and does not have a legally acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the informed consent form to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the subject and the witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed consent was freely given and understood.

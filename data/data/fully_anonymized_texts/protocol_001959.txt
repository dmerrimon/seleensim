Roque [ADDRESS_1208621] prevalent signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease is that of rest 
tremor: a rhythmic oscillation of a limb or component of a limb which occurs primarily at rest but can reemerge during the maintenance of a posture or while attempting to approach a target. Although rigidity in Parkinson's can be disabling, rest tremor is frequently reported as a symptom which leads to the inability to perform fine motor tasks especially when attempting to approximate targets.  This can lead to the rapid inability for patients to maintain their current employment and even perform instrumental activities of daily living. 
 
Although a number of treatment options have been developed to provide symptomatic relief over 
the course of the last [ADDRESS_1208622] medically -refractory 
symptoms of Parkinson's disease.  Among antiparkinsonian medications, levodopa replacement therapy has been reported to be perhaps least effective in reducing tremor, with  dopamine 
agonists having a reasonably higher chance of reducing rest tremor per earlier studies.  Alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_866253] , ultimately still with suboptimal outcomes on tremor reduction while  leaving a large 
portion of patients unable to tolerate the side effects.  As such, patients with medically -refractory 
rest tremor are left with one remaining option: to consider implantation of deep brain stimula tion 
hardware via elective brain surgery. This rather invasive procedure has been shown to have success rates of 80 -85% on reducing rest tremor and in many cases eliminating rest tremor even 
for at least 15 years after implantation. Understandably, many pa tients are wary of elective brain 
surgery and would prefer to lose their functional independence as opposed to undergoing such a high-risk procedure. 
Onabotulinum toxin A has been used (and in many cases FDA-approved) as a means of 
decreasing tone in a number of patients with conditions including spasticity and dystonia, but even hyperkinetic movements such as blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, essential tremor,  and 
spastic bladder.  Although Parkinson's disease is traditionally thought of as a hypokinetic movement disorder, the rest tremor inherently is an adventitious movement considered 
hyperkinetic in phenomenology. 
When choosing the proper targets for injection of botulinum toxins in rest tremor, without proper 
planningone could easily overdose the muscles and lead to weakness which may outweigh the benefits on reduced tremor amplitude. To date, studies which have evaluated the effect of botulinum toxin on rest tremor in Parkinson’s disease have used typi[INVESTIGATOR_866254], later titrating do ses higher to effect.  Given that statistically -significant effect is based 
on gross characterization of tremor amplitude into previously-existing nominal scales (namely the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale tremor subscore), it would not be suprising that titrating doses “to effect” will subject the participant to higher toxin doses that, in turn, are more likely to produce clinically-evident weakness. Subsequently, these same studies have not been able to correlate reduced tremor amplitude to any cl ear functional improvement save for a single, 
recently -published open-label study on the subject. However, functional improvement in the 
Roque 4 
studies has generally only been assessed through subjective , self -reported measures/scales and 
not through any objective measures.  
We propose there is a lesson to learn from task -specific dystonia s: usually we have to utilize 
much lower doses of botulinum toxin in practice to avoid weakness while still providing benefit 
on function of the limb as measured by [CONTACT_866274]. Given that rest tremor inherently is not related to nor produced by [CONTACT_866275], there is reason to believe that low doses of botulinum toxin may still provide reduction of amplitude without inducing weakness. Previous studies sometimes injected  only involve either a set of flexor or extensor muscles while 
others injec ted a combination of both muscles involved in creating the oscillatory movement. To 
help reduce chances of weakness as best possible, we propose that splitting doses of botulinum 
injections into a combination of both flexor and extensor muscles would be sa fest. What remains 
to be seen his whether such low doses of botulinum toxin injected into a combination to both tremor -inducing flexor and extensor muscles might also lead to improvement of tremor 
amplitude and/or function of the limb. 
To achieve the goal of reducing tremor amplitude without inducing weakness, we may require a 
more sensitive means of measuring distance traveled without relying on previous gross, nominal scales. Over time, a number of measuring instruments in the form of gyroscopic gloves ha ve 
been created to help study quantitative and qualitative data for adventitious movements such as tremor.  However, information derived from gyroscopes and accelerometers has been technically limited by [CONTACT_866276]  a foot, whereas tremor amplitudes 
are generally characterized and graded at the centimeter level . Further limiting the utility of these 
instruments is the fact that they add weight onto a participant’s hand/limb, artificially suppressing some of the amplitude of the organic tremor. For this reason, most studies have 
utilized such devices/gloves to grossly characterize tremor amplitudes into the previously-described nominal scales . As such, a device that can measure amplitude changes more accurately 
and precisely without bearing weight on the affected limb with tremor could also potentially be designed primarily to evaluate the change in tremor amplitude  with greater sensitivity . 
Subsequently, this would allow for more precise measurements of changes in amplitude after an intervention such as botulinum toxin. Such a tool could also provide quantitative data on direction of greatest oscillatory movement such that it may help guide decision-making when choosing which muscle groups are thought to produce the rest tremor.  
 
In an effort to meet the demand for such a device with better ability to measure amplitude and 
directional information from a tremor, the utilization of motion -capture cameras on multiple 
other fa cets of mobility in neurologic disease has been promising. When applied at the 
appropriate distance from an object, information about trajectory in 3- dimensional space has 
been achieved with greater accuracy and reliability. For purposes of obtaining more accurate, objective information regarding tremor amplitude, we plan to apply this technology to evaluate tremor characteristics both prior to and after interventions and predetermined time intervals. Hereafter, the stereotactic camera apparatus shall be labeled as the “Px1.” 
II. Objectives and Hypotheses  
Roque 5 
 
i. Specific Aims :   
 
1.  Evaluate the effect of onabotulinumtoxin A on medically- refractory rest tremor:  
a. Severity/Amplitude : As measured by [CONTACT_292795] -UPDRS 
tremor subscore. 
b. Limb function: As measured by [CONTACT_866277] (ARAT)  
2. Evaluate Px1 versus expert clinical assessment and its sensitivity 
to detect changes based on the MDS -UPDRS tremor subscore 
3. Determine whether methodology for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_866255] a larger subsequent study that could be adequately powered to detect a clinically -meaningful effect of 
onabotulinumtoxin A on medically- refractory rest tremor.  
 
ii. Hypotheses :  
1. (A) Onabotulinumtoxin A significantly attenuates the amplitude of medically -
refractory rest tremor of the upper limb in Parkinson’s patients as compared to sham injections ; as measured by [CONTACT_866278]-UPDRS tremor subscore. 
1. (B)  Onabotulinumtoxin A significantly impr oves the limb function  of Parkinson’s 
patients with medically -refractory rest tremor of the upper limb as compared to sham 
injections; as measured by [CONTACT_866279] . 
 
III.  Subjects  
 i.  Pi[CONTACT_158793] 
 
• Number – [ADDRESS_1208623] of 16 participants throughout the proposed course of the study. 
• Gender – male or female  
• Ethnicity – all, no restrictions  
• Race – all, no restriction s 
• Age – 45-80 
 
ii.  Eligibility Criteria  
 
 Inclusion Criteria : 
1. At least 4 5 years of age, and no more than 80 years of age.  
2. Meet [LOCATION_006] Parkinson’s disease brain bank diagnostic criteria 
3. Have clinical evidence of rest tremor of one or both upper extremities defined as 
involuntary, rhythmic oscillations about any joint within the upper extremities 
4. Rest tremor amplitude must be at minimum [ADDRESS_1208624] . Confirm ation of amplitude  measurement will 
Roque 6 
be obtained from the Px1 prior to active participation in the study  but will not be 
used for inclusion/exclusion in study participation. 
5. Rest tremor must be historically refractory to at least 2 categories of medications 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_866256] -parkinsonian agents including levodopa formulations, 
dopamine agonists, amantadine, and anticholinergics. 
6. Determining Medication Refractoriness:  
AFTER patient is consented:  
a. By [CONTACT_969], patient reports that they received no subjective benefit from two different categories of anti -Parkinsonian medications, including: 
levodopa replacement, dopamine agonists, anticholinergic agents, amantadine.   If subject is on therapy at present, the current therapy could 
count towards quantifying the medications which have failed to reduce tremor , so long as tremor amplitude meets inclusion criterion “4”. 
Patient will be asked whether, on average, they believe their tremor has been consistently disabling over the course of the last month. 
b. Medication refractoriness will be confirmed  through observation at time 
of peak -dose effect of one of the reported oral agents which have failed 
to reduce tremor.  Note that within -individual intermittency and 
variability of rest tremor can be influenced by [CONTACT_112344], stress, cold temperature, and fatigue. In an effort to reduce this variability, we will examine subjects in a comfortable area of the clinic space, providing up to [ADDRESS_1208625] is felt to still meet inclusion criterion 
“4” , they will remain a possible candidate for the study. 
d. Once the movement disorder specialist considers the subject a possible candidate, the rest tremor amplitude will be assessed using the Px1. This 
assessment should be completed within 10-[ADDRESS_1208626] be able to make no changes to their anti -parkinsonian

IV. Research Plan  
 
i. Recruitment & Consent  
 Subjects  will be recruited from outpatients at UNC H clinics. In order to determine whether a 
patient meets inclusion or exclusion it will be necessary to review the patient’s electronic medical record at UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_866257]: clini c consultation history and physical, other clinic 
notes, neurological imaging including brain MRI. The information collected will be limited only to that which is necessary to contact [CONTACT_866282].   
Prospective subjects will be approached in person by [CONTACT_495341] a designee  
during a regularly scheduled clinic visit at the UNCH Neurology Movement Disorders Clinic.  
Alternatively, some prospective participants may have already expressed verbal interest during 
previous clinic visits for participating in future studies. For those patients, phone calls will be initiated with a script provided to explain the study and the level of their involvement. Prospective subjects will be told basic  information about the study. If the prospective subject is 
interested, a member of the study team will obtain written informed consent. Once consent is obtained, the study team member will go through inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study.  Should the  consented subject qualify for the study based on these criteria through the screening 
process, the subject will be scheduled for  the first study visit (which may or may not be on the 
same day as screening) .  
 
ii. Clinical Descriptive Data  
 Clinical descriptive data collected from subjects will include age, gender, race, ethnicity, prior and current medications used for treatment of rest tremor in Parkinson’s disease , years of 
reported Parkinson’s symptoms, MoCA score upon enrollment, other s ignificant current or past 
medical conditions, current medications, and drug allergies . Data recorded from the Px1 will 
include tremor frequency, amplitude, and suggested joint/muscle groups  involved in creating the 
oscillatory movement.

iii. Study Design  
a. The study will comprise of a double blinded, crossover study where the subjects will serve as their own controls. There will be no medication changes made to Parkinson’s disease medications throughout the subjects’ participation in the study. 
b. Randomization: Determined by [CONTACT_866283] a computer-
generated algorithm which will determine whether subject’s first intervention will be sham saline injections versus onabotulinum toxin A. The IDS Pharmacy will keep track of which agent was administered first to avoid administering same intervention twice.  
c. Blinding : Double-blinded study whereby [CONTACT_423], the movement disorder 
specialist injecting neurotoxin, and the movement disorder specialist rating the patient will be unaware of the solution injected and/or planned for injection same day. To ensure that the injecting specialist is blinded to the solution , syringes will be premixed 
by [CONTACT_866284]-identified of any possible labels that would indicate the properties of the solution being administered to the subject.

affected by [CONTACT_866290], the following paradigm was predetermined based off of typi[INVESTIGATOR_866259] A. 
Roque 11 
i. Choice of doses per muscle are based off of clinical practice experience 
and typi[INVESTIGATOR_866260]- specific dystonia where perceived 
and measurable weakness based on MRC (Medical Research Council) muscle testing have been found to be, on average, undetectable.  
b. Decision of which muscles to inject will be based off of clinical expertise by [CONTACT_866291]. The following paradigms will be adhered to:

c. A maximum of 50 units of onabotulinum toxin would be allowed per upper extremity.   
 
 
k. EMG -guided injections  
a. For purposes of properly identifying muscles intended for injection, a portable EMG (Myoguide system from Intronix Technology Corp., or equivalent) will be attached to an appropriate gauge EMG-guided botulinum toxin needle (Myoject by [CONTACT_866292], or equivalent), which in turn will be used to hear/see motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Subjects will be asked to activate the m uscle 
while needle is inserted to ensure proper placement of the needle in the desired muscle prior to injection of study solution. 
l. Obtaining measurement with the Px1  
Roque 12 
a. Duration employed for tremor assessment: 15 seconds per assessment. We will 
plan on obtaining 3 different measures prior to any of the interventions (saline 
or botulinum toxin) per visit, essentially over the course of 30 minutes. Every measurement/assessment is inherently an average, but the plan will be to average the [ADDRESS_1208635] time of thei r antiparkinsonian 
medication (using known, typi[INVESTIGATOR_866261]) with every visit. This will require coordination with the participant to ensure timely oral delivery , as delineated above for each visit. 
 V. Benefits and Risks/Minimization of Risk  
 Benefits  
There could be direct benefits to subjects who agree to participate. During the course of the 
study, the investigational agent (onabotulinumtoxin A) may reduce the amplitude of the participants ’ rest tremor. Given the nature of neurotoxins, however, this clinical effect is 
expected to be transient and last for no longer than three months. There will be no travel expense reimbursement  and no payment for participation.  
 The benefits to society: given that currently rest tremor in Parkinson’s disease c an be 
disabling and refractory to oral medication options, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_866262] A to minimize the amplitude of tremor 
and return prior function to affected upper extremities. Thereafter, those individuals whose tremors might be positively affected could also contribute to the workforce for longer (as rest tremor could be highly influential in making decisions to either apply for early disability or retirement).  
 Risks and Minimization of Risk 
 The Px1  
The Px1 is an optical measurement system that aims to capture data on digital oscillation in 3-space. The Px1 is  physically comprised of Intel's RealSense SR300 peripheral camera / 
projector, with software integration which identifies structures of the hand (primarily joints) reliably without the need of obstructing elements such as soft  rubber finger "caps" 
or "cones". To use the device, the subject need only extend or rest their arm in proximity of the SR3 00 camera (i.e., within 1 meter). Instructions on how participants should position the 
hand in front of the camera will be provided at the time of assessment. In total, the hand will 
be assessed  in 3 different postures: 
 
1) With the participant sitting in an armchair with elbow rested on the armrest while the wrist entirely hangs over the front edge of the armrest for proper assessment by [CONTACT_437850] 
2) With the participant sitting in an armchair, arm outstretched in the forward position (arm flexed 90°, elbow extended fully and wrist at midplane)  
Roque 13 
3) With the participant sitting in an armchair with shoulder abducted 90°, elbow flexed 90°, 
forearm rotated 90°, and wrist flexed 90° from midplane (a known, common posture that can exacerbate rest tremor)  
 The patient wi ll make no contact [INVESTIGATOR_352359]. There are no conceivable risks  anticipated 
for participants exposed to this device. .   The Px1's function is achieved almost entirely in software developed for this purpose. The SR300 peripheral camera should present no conceivable risk to the subject and has been rigorously tested as a commercial product that is featured in new HP, Dell, and Lenovo computers.  Output from the Px1’s recordings will come in [ADDRESS_1208636], there will be a graphical representatio n of an articulated hand with concentric circles surrounding each joint 
of varying sizes depending on the total distance traveled by [CONTACT_866293]. These amplitudes will be further quantified in a tabular fashion  (Excel 
spreadsheet) with distance traveled measured in centimeters to a total of 2 decimal points. 
Similar graphical representation and tabular quantification will be obtained for frequency of oscillatory movement measured in hertz.  Onabotulinumtoxin A  
There are two potential categories of risks associated with neurotoxin injections: procedural 
risks and medication side effects.  
a. Procedural risks: a. Pain/discomfort/local site reaction: (approximate inciden ce 1-10%) could be 
related to either the puncture through the dermis, or through the muscle itself. Frequently self -limiting, with the option to use over-the- counter analgesics as 
needed until pain resolves . Plans to minimize risk involve using commonly- used 
injection approaches when inject ing the planned  muscle groups of the hand, 
forearm, and arm.  
b. Injury: given the minimally -invasive nature of this procedure, there are risks 
including bleeding and infection/inflammation. To minimize risk, will utilize the smallest needle gauges possible to obtain access to the individually- injected 
muscles while also providing smaller dilution to minimize total volume delivered (0.1 mL: 5 units of onabotulinum toxin). Sterile technique will be kept during the entirety of the procedure, with instructions provided to the subject on how to address any evidence of infection in a timely fashion. 
b. Medication side effect:  
a. Weakness: (approximate incidence 1-10%) The predetermined neurotoxin 
dosing regimen per muscle group was designed to minimize the likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_866263]. However, weakness would be a transient effect and will wear off as any medication benefit also wears off.  
Difficulty swallowing/breathing: (ap proximate incidence < 1%) mostly hypothetical adverse 
effect of onabotulinum toxin which is within the warnings typi[INVESTIGATOR_866264] [ADDRESS_1208637] through the vascular supply to a site distant from the intended target (and hence, 
could develop swallowing/breathing difficulties related to the weakness of muscle groups 
required for these activities)  
Carbidopa/Levodopa:  This medication is prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_83576] i n almost all patients with Parkinson’s disease at some 
point during their disease course. It would be standard of care that at least at some point patients will have been attempted on this therapy throughout their disease course, whether early or advanced disease. In fact, typi[INVESTIGATOR_866265]’s disease in advanced stages of disease (when patients would be thought to be most susceptible to side effects).  
 Note that approximate incidences for carbidopa/levodopa medication side effects  are 
primarily published as common versus uncommon. R are adverse effects are also listed in the 
package insert with an understanding that a correlation between use of medication and the symptom in question might exist: 
1. Common si de effects: Dyskinesias, nausea  
2. Uncommon side effects: hypotension, orthostatism, hallucinations 
3. Rare side effects: Chest pain, , diarrhea, hallucinations, hypersexuality, impulse control disorders, headache, dizziness, confusion, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, rash, abdominal pain 
 
Sham normal saline injections  Procedural risks associated with these injections would be similar to those identified above for onabotulinumtoxin A injections. Medication side effects would not be expected in this group.  Medical follow -up: 
in the event that a subject were found during the course of the study to need medical or psychological follow-up related to their study involvement, the following procedures will be followed to address their issues.  
1. Medical:  For urgent issues while on site, we will direct subjects to the UNC 
emergency room. For urgent issues that arise outside of the study site but as a potential result of the intervention, we will direct subjects  to the ir nearest 
emergency room versus urgent care center  for evaluation, based off of the 
described difficulties and symptoms. For nonurgent (subacute, chronic) issues related to Parkinson’s disease, a follow-up appointment within our department will be scheduled for within 72 hours of the communication. If the issue is unrelated to their Parkinson’s but also nonurgent, will communicate with the subject’s primary care physician and, when appropriate, disclose necessary information regarding the study protocol should it be relevant to the complaints at hand. 
2. Psychological: for urgent issues, will direct subjects to the nearest crisis unit if 
necessary (including but not limited to suicidal ideations or intentions, severe and rapid depression/ anxiety ). For nonurgent (subacute/chronic) issues, will supply 
Roque [ADDRESS_1208638] 
information for those within the university system to obtain the next available appointment. 
 VI. Data Monitoring and Statistical Analysis  
 
Power Calculation  
  No power calculation can be performed. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_866266] A can be utilized to reduce resting tremor amplitude and improve arm function.  
Data Analysis (Performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kevin Robertson, PhD) 
 Note that all statistical analysis, and as such any missing data/values/dropouts, will be performed assuming an intention- to-treat principle.  All statistical estimates will be tabulated along with 
corresponding confidence intervals (CIs). All hypothesis tests that are observed to be not statistically significant will be reported as being inconclusive. Lastly, all data acquired for Visit [ADDRESS_1208639] is occurring and that there is expected normalization of values trending towards or back to previous baseline values. For this reason, there is an absence of any testing with the Px1 on Visit 5 (since data will not be utilized to compare to previous visits for purposes of statistical analysis).  
 Specific Aim 1 a. The change in tremor severity  effected by [CONTACT_866294] A will be 
compared to the change effected by [CONTACT_866295]. Tremor severity will be measured via the MDS -
UPDRS tremor subscore. A Student ’s t-test will be utilized to compare postintervention 
measures  within subjects . 
 Specific Aim 1b. The change in limb function as measured  by [CONTACT_866296] A will be compared to the change created by [CONTACT_866295] . A Student ’s t-test 
analysis  will be used to compare change in ARAT scores within subjects . 
 
Specific Aim 2.  The strength of the correlation between MDS -UPDRS tremor subscore and 
tremor characteristics as assessed by [CONTACT_866297]1 will be obtained. Will then evaluate the strength of 
the correlation between the change in MDS -UPDRS score and change in the ARAT score. This 
latter correlation will then be compared to the correlation between the change in tremor 
characteristics as assessed by [CONTACT_866297]1 and the change in the ARAT score.  
 Specific Aim 3.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_866267]. Subsequent power analysis will 
be performed to determine size of study population that is necessary to adequately measure statistically significant effect. Data regarding dropout rates will also be reviewed to determine if study methodology needs to be adjusted for a larger study population.  
Interpretation of Results 
 
Roque 16 
Specific Aim 1 a.  A reduction in severity/ amplitude of the rest tremor by [CONTACT_866294] A 
greater than the change in sever ity/amplitude from sham saline injections suggests that 
onabotulinumtoxin A may be superior to sham saline injections in reducing severity of 
medically -refractory rest tremor and will be used as preliminary data for future grant proposals 
for larger, more rigorous studies.  Failure to demonstrate this difference  would suggest one or 
more of several possibilities: (1) that the doses of onabotulinumtoxin A were too low to lead to a measurable effect, and/or (2) onabotulinumtoxin A does not show promise as an intervention to 
reduce rest tremor amplitude compared to sham injections and should not be further studied for 
this purpose. The information gathered from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_866268] (1) postulate higher dose delivery to reach an effect, and/or (2) choose alternative botulinum toxins that might produce an effect on tremor as compared to onabotulinumtoxin A. Using these variables, a subsequent study could be designed.  Specific Aim 1b.  A greater  increase in  score on the ARAT after onabotulinum toxin injection 
compared to after sham saline injections suggests that onabotulinumtoxin A may provide 
clinically -meaningful improvement on the interruption caused by [CONTACT_866298], and this preliminary data will be used for future grant proposals for larger, more rigorous studies. Failure to demonstrate this difference would suggest one or more of several possibilities: (1) that the doses of onabotulinumtoxin A were too low to lead to a measurable effect, and/or (2) onabotulinumtoxin A does not show promise as an intervention to improve arm function in the setting of rest tremor as measured by [CONTACT_866299], and thus it should not be further studied for this purpose. The information gathered from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_866268] (1) postulate higher or lower dose delivery to reach an effect, and/or (2) choose alternative botulinum toxins that might produce an effect on tremor as compared to onabotulinumtoxin A. Using these variables, a s ubsequent study could be designed. 
 Specific Aim 2.   A statistically -significant correlation between the MDS -UPDRS tremor 
subscores and the tremor amplitude measurements derived from the Px1 could serve to validate this tool against the current gold standard (i.e. the MDS- UPDRS) for measuring severity of 
tremor in Parkinson's di sease both in research and clinical practice. This preliminary data would 
be used for future grant proposals for larger, more rigorous studies; including potentially additional studies using the Px1 as a potentially more -sensitive measure of tremor 
severity/amplitude in place of the MDS -UPDRS tremor subscore. Failure to demonstrate this 
correlation would suggest one or more of several possibilities: (1) that the Px1 is not sufficiently accurate in its measurement acquisition algorithm, and/or (2) the MDS-UPDRS tremor subscore is subject to too much subjectivity from the rater's perception on direct visualization and has less intrarater reliability th an was previously perceived. The information gathered from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_866269] (1) adjust the measurement algorithm for the Px1 to improve accuracy when measuring hand movements in real -life subjects versus calibrated limbs, and/or 
(2) increase  the number of MDS- UPDRS raters assessing a limb tremor. Using these variables, a 
subsequent study could be designed. 
Data Storage & Security/Confidentiality/Sharing  
In order to maintain privacy and confidentiality regarding subject  participation, there will only be 
one printed copy of a spreadsheet with codes linked to their identifiers (which will only include name [CONTACT_18131]). This spreadsheet will be kept in the [CONTACT_866305]’s office within a locked 
Roque [ADDRESS_1208640] any UNC medical records.  
All baseline clinical and experimental data will be recorded on paper case report forms and then transferred by [CONTACT_866300] , entering 
into the secure database REDCap @ UNC . Paper case report forms will be stored in double-
locked storage. All computerized records will be password protected and HIPAA compliant. Access to all records will be restricted to the pro ject investigators unless approved by [CONTACT_866301]. Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_866302].  No individual identifying information will be included in any reports on this study.  
Given  the design of the Px1, data regarding tremor direction, amplitude, frequency, etc. will be 
obtained automatically by [CONTACT_866303]. This will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_866270] t visit and with subsequent study 
visits.  
 VII. Safety Monitoring Plan 
 In case symptoms occur outside of business hours, the subject will be provided the telephone 
number of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_866271]- call 
neurologist who subsequently will contact  [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Roque directly with information . For non-urgent 
issues, the subjects will be asked to call [CONTACT_866305]’s office number that is listed on the consent form of which the subject will receive a copy. 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_866272]. All serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB. Should t here be a serious adverse event that occurs that 
increases the risks to the participants, the study will be stopped and an investigation will be conducted and a findings report generated before the study is resumed. At the time of enrollment, we will ensur e we have an active and accurate phone number on file to contact [CONTACT_423]. 
Thereafter, weekly phone calls will be made by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a designee for the first four weeks after injection visits to ask questions including but not limited to significant weakness, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, injection site reactions, or other self-reported concerns. 
 
VIII.  Potential Problems and Limitations 
 This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_866273] A 
therapy to reduce the amplitude of rest tremor and improve arm function. There are two novel components to the study design that have been utilized in similar studies but not directly aimed at measuring and improving rest tremor in Parkinson’s. These incl ude the ARAT (which has been 
utilize d for arm function pre-and post-botulinum toxin injections to the upper limb, but not to 
assess rest tremor) and the introduction of a new measurement device (the Px1)  that will provide 
the objective measures of tremor amplitude, frequency, and direction of movement. Although validation of the data acquired from the Px1 will occur, more traditional methods of measuring 
Roque 18 
tremor (the MDS -UPDRS tremor subscore) will be performed during the visit intervals of the 
study to acco unt for the novel applications of the se assessment tools.

8  BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  In the Unites States, the number of patients listed for solid organ transplant dramatically exceeds the numbers of organs available and utilized for donation. For kidney transplant, mean waiting times are measured in years. There is a 4 % mortality on the kidney wait list, with much higher rates for diabetic and elderly candidates. On the liver wait list, the mortality rate is considerably higher, averaging about 20% at most centers. Numerous strategies are utilized to expand the standard donor pool for kidney or liver transplant, including using organs from deceased donors exposed to chronic viral infections (e.g. cytomegalovirus and hepatitis B virus), Public Health Services increased risk donors, older donors, donation after cardiac death, and livers with increased steatosis.  Deceased solid organ donors with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represent another potential source of expanding the organ donor pool. HCV affects about 1.6% of the general population in the [LOCATION_002]. The prevalence of HCV was more than triple this number for American organ donors from 2004 - 2008 (Armstrong). Among high-risk donors, who represent up to 30% of all donors, the prevalence was as high as 18.2% (Ellingson, (Kucirka Am J Transplant 2009 PMID 20353475). Perhaps reflecting the ongoing opi[INVESTIGATOR_150568], in some organ procurement organization areas, nearly 15% of even the current general organ donor pool is HCV positive (personal communication, Alex Glazier, CEO, New England Organ Bank). As these donors are typi[INVESTIGATOR_150569], the organs may be higher quality than would be otherwise available from HCV negative donors.  Historically, organs from HCV-positive donors have been underutilized. Reese, et al. identified 3273 HCV-antibody positive deceased kidney donors from 2005-2014 for whom organ donation was authorized (Reese). Only 2402/6546 (37%) of the donated kidneys were transplanted; 91% of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150570]. The other kidneys were discarded. In addition, as many as one third of solid organs may not be procured from potential donors who were HCV-antibody positive (Seem), presumably due to concerns they would not be utilized by [CONTACT_150603].  In the past, this hesitancy to use HCV-positive organs reflected concerns about the negative liver and extrahepatic outcomes of refractory HCV infection in the setting of immunosuppression. Still, many centers in the [LOCATION_002] have utilized hepatitis C-positive solid organs for hepatitis C-positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. For liver transplant, most studies have shown equivalent survival for those HCV-positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150571]-positive livers, particularly if older donors (>55 years) and donor livers with fibrosis are avoided (Vargas, Marroquin, Berenguer). For kidney transplant, in one study the median waiting time for patients who accepted HCV-positive kidneys was 469 days versus 856 days for patients who received HCV-negative organs (Kucirka 20353475). In the era before direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs), the reduced mortality on the kidney wait list may have been offset by [CONTACT_150604]-transplant outcomes (Morales, Kucirka Am J Kid, Gasink, Fabrizi).  
PRO-ACT  Version 1.7 CONFIDENTIAL  18 January 2018  
9   The advent of safe and highly effective DAAs has revolutionized the treatment of HCV. In non-cirrhotic, immunocompetent patients, 12 weeks of treatment with the pan-genotypic regimen of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) has demonstrated sustained virological response (SVR) rates above 94% for all HCV genotypes (Foster, Feld). In kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150572], there are numerous publications showing excellent safety and near universal SVR using DAAs. In liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], including those with compensated cirrhosis, the SVR rates for all genotypes were 96-98% with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with or without ribavirin. (Saab, Charlton, Manns) and at least 91% with sofosbuvir, daclatasvir and ribavirin (Poordad).  In a recent study of 79 liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150573] 1-4 HCV infection treated with SOF/VEL,   SVR rates were greater than 93% for all genotypes, including genotype 1 subtypes (Agarwal).  While there is ample precedent for using HCV-positive organs for HCV-positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], utilizing an HCV-positive organ for an HCV-negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150574] (Northup, Gasink, Gudmundsson). In an open-label pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 10 HCV-negative kidney recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150575]-1 infected kidney (Goldberg). On day 3 after transplantation, all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150576]. All 10 were cured with 12 weeks of the genotype-specific regimen of grazoprevir and elbasvir.    The need to study using HCV positive organs for HCV negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150577] a recent position paper from the American Society of Transplantation (Levitsky). In this current pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will utilize kidneys and livers from HCV NAT positive donors for HCV-negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Pan-genotypic HCV therapy with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) will be started usually within the first week (but up to 4 weeks per investigator discretion) after transplant and continued for [ADDRESS_173676] donation to donors with genotype 1 or 4 HCV. The justification for using a pan-genotypic regimen is the imperative to start treating the HCV infection as soon as possible after transplant, potentially before commercial testing for HCV genotype would be available.   In summary, this study has the potential to demonstrate that organs from HCV NAT positive donors can be used safely and effectively in HCV negative patients. Given the established safety and efficacy of pan-genotypic regimens such as SOF/VEL, we hypothesize that the post-transplant de novo HCV infections will be successfully cured with a favorable safety profile. The importance of this study is that it may demonstrate an effective way to increase the organ donor pool and to shorten the waiting time for patients being transplanted who might otherwise not receive an organ.  Pharmacologic considerations. Velpatasvir is a substrate for Cytochrome p450 3A4 (CYP3A4), CYP2C8 and CYP2B6 and a weak (P-glycoprotein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide) to moderate (breast cancer resistance protein) transport inhibitor. It is moderately affected by [CONTACT_150605] a greater extent, potent

10  inducers of enzyme/drug transporter systems (Mogalian). Based on this profile, which is similar to ledipasvir, clinically significant drug-drug interactions would not be expected for co-administration of SOF/VEL with tacrolimus, cyclosporine, corticosteroids and/or mycophenolate mofetil.   One potential concern for using SOF/VEL in the early post-transplant setting may be the development of post-transplant acute kidney insufficiency. The labelling information states that the safety and efficacy of SOF/VEL have not been established in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or ESRD requiring hemodialysis. However, post marketing data have characterized the safety of sofosbuvir-based therapy in patients with severe renal failure or on hemodialysis (Desnoyer, Dumortier) and specifically in the post-kidney (Beinhardt) and post-liver transplantation setting (Saab J Clin Gastro). Moreover, the principal investigators in this trial will use their discretion as to the exact timing of the initiation of DAA therapy and the subjects will be intensely monitored during the treatment and follow-up periods.   Risk/Benefit Assessment. This study will provide information regarding the safety of efficacy of SOF/VEL in HCV negative liver and/or kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150560]. The potential benefits of utilizing HCV NAT-positive organs are reduced morbidity and mortality compared to what would be expected from remaining on the transplant waiting lists until a suitable HCV negative organ would become available. Potential risks of this study include those related to unsuccessfully treated HCV infection. To mitigate these potential risks, antiviral therapy will be started usually within the first week (but up to 4 weeks per investigator discretion) after transplant and there will be close monitoring of laboratory values as well as AEs. In addition, in the event of virologic failure following treatment with SOF/VEL, subjects will be eligible for re-treatment with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) VOSEVI therapy in the Virologic Failure Substudy There will also be two Safety Reviews conducted by [CONTACT_150606]. While the potential benefits and risks must be confirmed in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the data from the THINKER trial, the endorsement of such a study from the American Society of Transplantation, and the favorable safety profile of SOF/VEL provide strong rationale for a positive benefit/risk ratio in support of this study.  Compliance. This study will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and all applicable regulatory requirements.

12  STUDY DESIGN  Description  This is a prospective multicenter, open-label, proof of concept study being conducted at up to 6 American sites (See Appendix 2). The study aims to enroll up to 30 study subjects undergoing liver and/or kidney transplantation, at least [ADDRESS_173677] for liver of kidney transplant at each participating institution. The informed consent process for this trial is comprised of three steps:  1) Pre-screening: As part of pre-transplant evaluation, treating nephrologists and hepatologists will have a detailed discussion with their patients regarding high-risk donors, including those who are HCV NAT-positive. For HCV negative patients who express interest in receiving an HCV NAT-positive donor, their treating hepatologist or nephrologist will refer them to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-investigator for this study.   2. Informed consent: the principal investigator, or co-investigator, will review the potential risks and benefits of participating in this trial, including a discussion regarding  HCV treatment and complications of unsuccessfully treated post-transplantation HCV, including graft loss, fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, cirrhosis and death. The discussion will also describe that organ donors in the trial might be classified as Public Health Service elevated risk for window infection with HIV. This step of the informed consent process will include documentation that each of these elements has been reviewed with the patient who understands and has ample opportunity to have all of their questions and concerns addressed. Participants who are deemed eligible and sign consent will be rendered eligible for HCV-viremic kidney or liver offers through an opt-in mechanism in the allocation system administered by [CONTACT_150607]/United Network for Organ Sharing (OPTN/UNOS).  3. Confirmation of Informed Consent: eligibility and subject’s willingness to proceed with an HCV-positive donor will be re-confirmed by [CONTACT_150608].  This will be documented by [CONTACT_150609] 24 hours before the planned liver or kidney transplant (the “Pre-Transplant day”) with a review of the potential risks and benefits of participating in this trial, including a discussion regarding HCV treatment and complications of unsuccessfully treated post-transplantation HCV, complications including graft loss, fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, cirrhosis and death. This step of the informed consent process will include documentation that each of these elements has been reviewed with the patient who understands and has ample opportunity to have all of their questions and concerns addressed.   On the Pre-Transplant Day, after it has been confirmed that both the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150579]-ACT  Version 1.[ADDRESS_173678]-transplant (but up to [ADDRESS_173679]-transplant per investigator discretion). HCV viremia will be confirmed before study treatment is started. Day 1 is defined as the day that the study drug commences. Subjects will be administered SOF/VEL (Sofosbuvir 400 mg/Velpatasir 100 mg fixed-dose combination) once daily with or without food for 12 weeks.               Administration of study medication may be permanently discontinued at any time during the treatment period due to a clinical or laboratory event at the discretion of the investigator. There is no option for SOF/VEL dose reduction. If subjects miss a dose (or doses) of study drug, they will still complete the full [ADDRESS_173680] stop all study medications: x Any medical condition, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], where the risks of continuing the study medications outweighs the benefits; x Any Grade 4 adverse event assessed as related to SOF/VEL.  Immunosuppressant therapy will be per the individual center’s usual treatment protocol. Immunosuppressant levels will be done and immunosuppressant dosages will be recorded on treatment days 3 and 7; weekly during the treatment period; at the end of treatment; and 4, 12 and 24 weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Unscheduled therapeutic drug levels may be obtained more frequently at the discretion of the investigator. Modifications in immunosuppression regimen will be at the discretion of the investigator.  Efficacy. Serial quantitative HCV RNA testing will be performed by [CONTACT_4475] 7 after transplant if study medication has not been started, Day 1, on treatment weeks 1 and 4; end of treatment; and weeks 4, 12 and 24 after discontinuation of therapy.   Safety. Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded for all patients who receive a NAT-positive HCV organ through [ADDRESS_173681] dose of study drug.  Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the lead investigators and the independent data and safety monitor within [ADDRESS_173682] a safety and efficacy review of all safety and efficacy data to date. When these same subjects reach follow up week 12 (corresponding to 24 weeks after starting study drug), the lead investigators and the independent data and safety monitor will conduct another safety and efficacy review.  Virologic Failure Substudy. In the event of virologic failure following treatment with SOF/VEL, subjects will be eligible for re-treatment with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) VOSEVI therapy in the Virologic

26  ADVERSE EVENTS AND TOXICICTY MANAGEMENT  Definitions An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a medicinal product. It does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. Preexisting events that increase in severity or change in nature during participation in a clinical study are considered AEs.   A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event that results in the following: x Death; x Life threatening event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; x Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; x Persistent or significant disability/incapacity; x A congenital anomaly/birth defect; x A medically important event or reaction that may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes constituting SAEs.  Safety monitoring Safety data will be collected for all subjects who sign their confirmation of consent at the end of the consent form and undergo a NAT-positive transplant through [ADDRESS_173705] subjects’ decisions about enrolling or continuing study drug throughout the study, including, but not limited to: AEs, SAEs, and new treatments that come available.  Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities. Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance are not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to investigational medicinal product interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well an SAE, if applicable. In addition, laboratory assessments that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE, or SAE, if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, record the diagnosis (i.e. anemia), not the laboratory abnormality (i.e. decreased hemoglobin).  Adverse Events. The investigator, or sub-investigator, is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for causality and severity. AEs will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03. This grading scale can be found at https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf.  
PRO-ACT  Version 1.[ADDRESS_173706] a safety and efficacy review. When these subjects reach follow up week 12 (24 weeks after starting study drug), the lead investigators and the independent data and safety monitor will conduct another safety and efficacy review.  Early termination: Participants may withdraw their consent to participate in this study at any time after they sign informed consent. Principal investigators can terminate participant(s) from the study for safety concerns. Subjects who take at least one dose of study drug and do not complete the planned [ADDRESS_173707]  Version 1.7 CONFIDENTIAL  18 January 2018  
28  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  Analysis Objectives The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of SOF/VEL in viral eradication among HCV negative liver and/or kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150560].  The secondary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of all SOF/VEL among HCV negative liver and/or kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150560].    The exploratory objective of this study is to compare the observed waiting time for transplant for HCV negative liver and/or kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150589].  Primary Efficacy Endpoint The proportion of participants with SVR 12 defined as HCV RNA < lower limit of quantification [ADDRESS_173708] dose of antiviral therapy.   Secondary Endpoints: x Proportion of subjects with SVR24 defined as HCV RNA < lower limit of quantification [ADDRESS_173709] dose of antiviral therapy; x Proportion of subjects with viral relapse defined as HCV RNA <LLOQ at end of treatment with subsequent quantifiable HCV RNA; x Proportion of participants with on-treatment virologic breakthrough defined as > 1 log increase in viral RNA after treatment week 1;  x Proportion of subjects who prematurely discontinue antiviral therapy before the planned end of treatment; x Patient and graft survival at [ADDRESS_173710]-transplant.  Exploratory Endpoint Change in wait time for kidney and/or liver transplant based on UNOS data for the participating regions.    Analysis Sets The primary analysis set for safety and efficacy analyses includes all subjects who undergo liver and/or kidney transplant after signing Part [ADDRESS_173711]  Version 1.7 CONFIDENTIAL  18 January 2018  
29  Efficacy Analysis  Primary and Secondary Endpoints No formal hypothesis testing will be performed, as this is an exploratory study. No inferential statistics or statistical comparisons are planned for efficacy endpoints. All subjects who undergo liver and/or kidney transplant with a nucleic acid test positive organ will be included in the analysis. We assume that none of the subjects will achieve SVR 12 without any antiviral therapy. The existing data for SOF/VEL have demonstrated a SVR rate above 94% in non-cirrhotic patients. We anticipate a similar SVR rate for our study. Along with the percentage of patients with SVR12, a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) is constructed by [CONTACT_150612]-Pearson method. With a sample size of 30 patients, if the SVR12 rate is 90%, the lower bound of the 95% CI would be 79% and the upper bound of the 95% CI would be 100%.  Exploratory Endpoint Shorter wait time from listing to transplant is a potential benefit of accepting a HCV positive organ. To characterize wait time among HCV positive organ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], mean wait time in log10 days will be calculated separately for liver and kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. With a sample size of 10, 15, or [ADDRESS_173712] 80% power to obtain a two-sided 95% CI half-width of 8, 5, and 4 days, respectively (CI half-width of 0.9, 0.7, and 0.6 log10 days).   To explore wait time by [CONTACT_150613], wait time would be collected for the HCV positive organ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150590], matched on blood type, gender, and transplant MELD (+/-5) for liver recipi[INVESTIGATOR_150591] (+/- 0.25) for kidney recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Mean wait time in log10 days for a HCV positive versus negative organ would be compared separately among liver and kidney recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. We anticipate obtaining wait time on 60 transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (at least 20 liver and 20 kidney recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). For a two-sided paired t-test assuming an alpha level of 0.05, we estimate having 80% power to detect a mean difference in wait time of 20, 10, and 8 days for sample sizes of 20, 30, and 40 patients, respectively.  Safety Analysis Safety will be assessed during the study through the reporting of AEs and by [CONTACT_150614]. Concomitant medication usage will also be assessed throughout the study. Descriptive statistics on the number and types of AEs will be recorded and presented in a tabular format. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) will also be summarized by [CONTACT_150615]. In addition, TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation of the study drug will be summarized and listed. Liver or kidney grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities will be described in the narrative.  Independent Data and Safety Monitor (IDSM) An IDSM with relevant clinical expertise will be chosen who has no financial, scientific, 
PRO-ACT  Version 1.[ADDRESS_173713] an open safety and efficacy review. When these same subjects reach follow up week 12 (24 weeks after starting study drug), the lead investigators and the IDSM will conduct another open safety and efficacy review. The IDSM will make recommendations to the lead investigators, and, if required, to the Food and Drug Administration concerning continuation, termination, or other modifications of the trials based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study.

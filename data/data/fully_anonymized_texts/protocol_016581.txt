7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits  ................................ ................................ .....................  [ADDRESS_162256] SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  
Asthma prevalence and morbidity have been increasing among children over the last three 
decades despi[INVESTIGATOR_142802]. The annual 
costs for children with asthma range between $2.0 and $3.2 billion. Asthma mor bidity and its 
associated costs are not borne equally; they are highest for urban, low income, African 
American and Puerto Rican children. Community health workers (CHWs) have been growing in 
popularity as a potential intervention to combat these asthma di sparities. CHWs are frontline 
public health workers who serve as liaisons between health and social services and 
communities to facilitate access to services and improve the quality and cultural competence of 
service delivery. The evidence on CHW asthma in tervention efficacy has been growing but 
several critical gaps still exist. The Asthma Action at Erie Trial will test the ability of a CHW 
intervention with three important modifications to achieve asthma control in high -risk children: 1) 
CHWs will be inte grated into both the clinical and the home setting, 2) A system for directly 
addressing mental health and psychosocial barriers will be provided, and 3) Participants will be 
provided only materials and equipment for trigger remediation that are supported b y the current 
medical reimbursement system.   
 
A two -arm behavioral randomized controlled trial (N=22 3) will be conducted in partnership with 
a federally -qualified health center (FQHC) serving a low income, minority population that is at 
high-risk for sign ificant asthma morbidity. The intervention arm will receive an integrated CHW 
home intervention for pediatric asthma education. The comparison arm will received clinic -
based certified asthma educator (AE -C) services. Primary Aim [ADDRESS_162257] 30% less days with activity limitation  than the AE -C arm at [ADDRESS_162258] -effectiveness at 12 -months 
of CHW and AE -C intervention delivery, and additional costs or savings related to asthma 
exacerbations at 12 - and 24 -months.  Specific Aim 4  is to assess the efficacy of the integrated 
CHW home asthma intervention relative to clinic -based AE -C education, as demonstrated  by 
[CONTACT_142818], among those experiencing depression, stress, and/or a post -traumatic stress 
disorder. This trial compares the current best practice in asthma self -management education 
(AE-C services) to an integrated CHW home intervention in which the real-life challenges of 
patients and the health care system are taken fully into account. This trial will provide clarity as 
to the expected effect size, cost savings, and resources needed to integrate asthma CHWs into 
clinical practice.

  2.0 BACKGR OUND/SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
Asthma morbidity and its associated costs are not borne equally.  African American and 
Puerto Rican children suffer disproportionately higher asthma prevalence and morbidity.[ADDRESS_162259] asthma prevalence rates ever reported. A survey of 
randomly selected Chicago households in 2002, which measured both diagnosed asthma and 
children with probable asthma, reported potential total asthma rates of 14% in Mexican children, 
20% in White children, 25% in Black children, and 34% in Puerto Rican children.[ADDRESS_162260] is growing around the potential role of community 
health workers  (CHWs) to control pediatric asthma in these high risk popula tions.  However, 
major gaps remain regarding specific CHW dose and protocols, associated efficacy on clinical 
outcomes, and integration into the healthcare system before the intervention can be effectively 
disseminated.6-[ADDRESS_162261] CURA (Clinical Trials ID 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was a behavioral randomized controlled trial to test the 
efficacy of a CHW intervention to improve medication adherence and reduce home triggers 
among Puerto Rican children and adolescents.10-[ADDRESS_162262] asthma core 
curriculum emphasizing physiology, triggers, medications, and physician communication. The 
interventions also included information on self -management skills. Data were collected at the 
end of the intervention period and one -year from the start date to assess maintenance. The 
sample was intentionally poorly controlled at baseline; all met criteria  for either uncontrolled 
and/or persistent asthma over the past year. Only 45% of the Elementary School Cohort and 
12% of the High School Cohort had an inhaled corticosteroid at baseline.  For those with an 
inhaled corticosteroid, the combined median adher ence was 1.0 doses/day (range 0 -3.3), 
meaning about 25% adherent to standard metered dose inhaler regimens.  Homes had an 
average of six asthma triggers.  Prevalence of depression was very high: 59% of caregivers and 
68% of teens reported signs of depressi on.  In the Elementary School Cohort (n=51), no 
differences were seen in outcomes between arms at any time point with one exception: the 
CHW arm had lower odds of having an ICS (OR=0.2; p=0.02) at 12 -months. Every point 
increase in baseline caregiver depre ssive symptoms was associated with a lower odds of 
controlled asthma (OR 0.9; 95% CI = 0.8, 1.0; p=0.02). The only significant treatment arm 
difference in the High School Cohort (n=50) was in inhaler technique. At 5 -months, the CHW 
arm performed 18.0% (95%  CI = 8.0, 28.1; p <0.01) more steps correct than the Mailings arm. 
At 12 -months, the CHW arm performed 14.2% (95% CI = 4.4, 24.1; p <0.01) more steps correct 
than the Mailings arm.   
The Community United to Raise Awareness: Asthma and Active Living: CURA 2 
(1P50HL105189 -01) was a follow -up to Project CURA where the number of CHW visits was

  expanded, the inclusion criteria expanded to all race/ethnicities, and content on pediatric obesity 
added. Similar to the original study, no environmental remediation eq uipment was provided and 
there was no clinical partner. Participants were children ages 5 -12 with asthma who were 
overweight or obese. They were offered 12 CHW home visits over one year. Of the 46 
participating families, the median number of home visits re ceived was 10; [ADDRESS_162263] at one -year. Scores of uncontrolled asthma (<20) on the Childhood 
Asthma Control Test improved significantly pre/post (38% to 14%, p<0.01). Improvements were 
seen in nighttime symptoms (49% to 26%, p<0.05), activity limitation (33% to 7%, p<0.01), and 
inhaler technique (steps correct: 60% to 90%, p<0.01). Medication adherence and home 
triggers did not change. Obesity changes did not mediate asthma outcomes.  
There is an urgent need for evidence f rom practical clinical trials where the CHW asthma 
intervention is integrated into a clinical real -world setting. We need to know: 1) How to formally 
connect CHWs and medical providers in a way that allows CHWs to keep their community focus 
but maintains a  reimbursable and replicable clinical structure. 2) How to achieve environmental 
remediation for trigger reduction within the current medical system. 3) How to integrate CHWs 
with existing resources for the management of psychosocial problems.  4) Cost dat a on the 
intervention delivery and outcomes.  The proposed study will answer these questions.  
 
3.0 Objectives/Aims  
 
Primary Aim 1:   To assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention, 
relative to clinic -based AE -C education over [ADDRESS_162264]/childhoo d Asthma Control Test . 
Specific Aim 2:  To assess maintenance of intervention efficacy, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_142819] 18 and 24 months after randomization.  We hypothesize that changes in 
efficacy outcomes will be maintained after cessation of the i ntervention.  
Specific Aim 3:  To determine the cost -effectiveness at 12 -months of CHW and AE -C 
intervention delivery, and additional costs or savings related to asthma exacerbations at 
12- and 24 -months.  
Specific Aim 4:  To assess the efficacy of the integr ated CHW home asthma intervention 
relative to clinic -based AE -C education, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_142818], among 
those experiencing depression, stress, and/or post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  
We hypothesize that among those living with depression , stress, and/or PTSD, the CHW 
intervention will be significantly more effective in achieving and maintaining asthma 
control than the AE -C education intervention.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_162265]/childhood Asthma Control Test,20-[ADDRESS_162266] Spanish as their primary language.  
The study also includes children, by [CONTACT_142820]/caregiver dyads. Children  under the 
age of 5 are excluded because the diagnosis of chronic asthma in this population is 
challenging.13 Children over 16 years of age are excluded because the management of 
their asthma usually changes from a caregiver/child partnership to mainly chi ld-driven 
and the role of environmental trigger reduction changes as well since the children spend 
less time in their parent’s home.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_162267] s. 
2. Erie providers and staff will be instructed to refer potential participants to call the study 
enrollment number, email the study enrollment team, talk to one of the study staff in 
clinic, or allow study staff to call them. During high volume times (scho ol physical 
season, flu vaccine season), charts will also be flagged for Erie providers and staff to 
address the study directly with families at the time of their visit. Study staff in clinic or on 
the phone/email will give descriptions of the study and if  a potential participant is 
interested, a formal screen will be initiated by a UIC research specialist.  
3. Flyers and signs  advertising the study will be created and distributed/posted.  
 
If a family is interested and passes the screener, they will then be sc heduled for a home 
visit. A University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)  research specialist (RS) will go to the home to 
perform informed consent/assent and to collect the baseline data. At that point, the family is 
ready for randomization. If recruitment at th e Erie primary care centers does not yield 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________   
Asthma Action at Erie Trial   Version 1 1 
Page 8 of 26   February 28, 2018  
  sufficient participants, other sites (school -based centers) will be opened. We will recruit 22 3 
participants (caregiver/child dyads), 111-[ADDRESS_162268] information will be saved and research staff can call them again in several months to 
rescreen them. Personal identifying data from the screening (initial and re -contact [CONTACT_142821]) will be 
kept in a secure location until recruitment is ended, at which point it will be destroyed. (We will 
keep their name [CONTACT_142862][CONTACT_142822].)  All staff involved in recruitment will receive careful training about the study and  
the clinic services to ensure that everyone approached understands that participation is 
voluntary and services at Erie will continue regardless of study participation, and so that Erie 
staff understands their primary role is patient care. Recruitment wil l not impi[INVESTIGATOR_142803]. Staff involved in recruitment have their time covered by [CONTACT_10748]. Providers who refer the study to patients do so when they have time and feel comfortable 
only.  
Randomization will be conduc ted in a 1:1 ratio using randomly mixed permuted blocks of 
size 4 and 6 to ensure reasonably equal allocation while reducing predictability of the 
assignment sequence. Upon completion of the randomization assignment, the data 
management team will generate a letter to the participant informing him/her of their study status 
and also notify the Erie Intervention Coordinator who will assign the patient to a CHW if 
randomized to that arm. Although double blinding in a behavioral randomized clinical trial is 
impo ssible, blinding will be maximized by: 1) incomplete disclosure of study goals for 
participants during consent (see Human Subjects for details), 2) blinding outcomes assessors; 
3) incomplete disclosure of research hypotheses for non -investigators staff; an d 4) training co -
investigators and staff in the concept of equipoise. Intervention investigators and staff will be 
unblinded to treatment arm because they will need to work with the CHWs and monitor 
intervention fidelity and data accuracy. Study staff and investigators (with the exception of the 
Safety Officer) will not have access to interim outcomes data.  
 
6.0 Study Design and Procedures  
6.1  Study Locations  
Research will be performed at Erie Family Health Center, in homes, and at UIC. Erie is 
the recruitment site. Erie is also the site where the AE -C intervention will occur. CHWs will be 
employed by [CONTACT_142823], but they will provide home visits as well. For more 
than fifty -five years, Erie has provided high quality, culturally s ensitive, and compassionate 
health care services to medically underserved populations on Chicago’s north and west sides. 
Today, Erie serves nearly 40,000 patients annually at thirteen sites.  Seventy -nine percent of 
Erie’s patients are Hispanic, 54% are be st served in Spanish, 68% are female, 49% are under 
the age of 19, 28% are school -aged children, 31% are uninsured, and 83% come from 
households with incomes that fall below the federal poverty line. Erie offers a wide range of 
behavioral health services i n addition to medical and dental services. Individual therapy, group 
therapy, women’s support groups, and substance abuse referrals are provided in the languages 
and settings preferred by [CONTACT_1962]. As an early adopter of innovative practices, Erie is well 
positioned to embrace the challenges presented by a changing health care environment.  
Systems like Erie’s Electronic Health Record system, Practice Management System, and 
advanced open access scheduling contribute to the delivery of coordinated care that is high 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________   
Asthma Action at Erie Trial   Version [ADDRESS_162269] systems, policies and procedures 
for managing grants and assuring that they meet stated goals and objectives. Erie successfully 
manages over $[ADDRESS_162270] center 
directors, development, and finance staff.  
UIC is the site for data management and analysis. No UIC patients will be involved in the 
research. Intervention will not occur at UIC.  
 
6.2  Design  
This study employs a modified community -based participatory research (CBPR) 
approach.  CBPR involves co -learning about issues of concern, reciprocal transfer of expertise, 
shared decision -making power, and mutual ownership of research products and processes.[ADDRESS_162271] (CAB) , an internal group made  up of patients and staff , on an as -needed basis, to advise 
the project  team . In addition , the Chicago Asthma Consortium  will function as our external 
advisory group.  The Chicago Asthma Consortium Advisory Board will  meet twice yearly . Major 
decisions on design, implementation, and dissemination will require approval of the CAB.  
This study is designed as a behavioral randomized controlled trial.  Child/caregiver 
dyads wi ll be recruited and then randomized to one of two arms: CHW home visits, or education 
in the clinic from a certified asthma educator (AE -C).  Intervention will be delivered in the first 
year of the study only.  Data will be collected at baseline,  6, 12-months (post intervention), 18 -
months, and 24 -months.  
   
 
              
 
 
 
 
6.3. Treatment Arm:  Pediatric Asthma CHW Home Intervention  
The pediatric asthma CHW home intervention is modeled after that of Krieger et.al.[ADDRESS_162272] CURA.  
6.3.1 Asthma Home Visit Protocol and Topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] : Families will be offered 10 home visits over 12 
months. At the CHW home visits, CHWs will spend 1 -2 hours with the family. CHWs will 
educate them on the “core curriculum.” The top ics in the core curriculum are standard topi[INVESTIGATOR_142804] (prevent chronic symptoms, 
infrequent use of quick relief medications, maintain normal activity levels) and reduce risk 
(prevent exacerbations, minimi ze emergency care, prevent reduced lung growth, and minimize 
adverse therapy effects).13 The CHWs will approach each visit with the intention to teach one or 
two of the core curriculum topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. Each visit will begin with several minutes of social discussion  
for the purpose of relationship building. Behavior change plans from the previous visit will be 
reviewed and discussed. Behavior change plans are small goals for a specific change over a 
several -week period. Examples include: “getting a prescription from my doctor” or “writing down

  when my child coughs”. The main portion of the visit will involve the education session around a 
core curriculum topic. When a CHW notes a barrier in the delivery of the education, he or she 
will then incorporate a relevant self -management skill. For example, the CHW may know that 
the family is not giving a medication as often as prescribed but instead of just saying that, the 
CHW will have the family track how often the child is receiving their medication (self -monitoring).  
The family will “self -discover” they do not give the medicine as often as recommended.  Then 
the CHW will have the family problem solve as to why that might be (storage location, parent 
work schedules, medication fear, etc.). Once they have a list of the prob lems, the family will 
create a behavior change plan for one problem they want to solve.   
6.3.2 Integrating CHWs in the Clinic:  Several of the Erie clinics are quite near each other in the 
Humboldt Park neighborhood. CHWs will be based out of one of these centrally located clinics 
but they will have access to all Erie clinics, computers, and staff. Once a participant is assigned 
to a CHW, the CHW will review the child’s health record . The goal will be to review the child’s 
health  with the child’s clinician.  Erie clinicians manage pediatric asthma using a detailed asthma 
smart form in the electronic medical record (EMR). They have access to spi[INVESTIGATOR_142805] . Whenever possible, t he clinician will outline his or her concerns and recommendations 
for the patient. If the provider is not available to meet with the CHW, the CHW will proceed with 
the standard home protocol. Then the CHW will meet with the family and  determine their 
concerns and expectations. The CHW will fill out a report of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_33722], behavior 
change plans, and potentially relevant issues after each visit . Summaries of t hese reports , and 
communications with providers,  will be uploaded into the EMR. The clinician and CHW will aim 
to discuss the participant at least two other times during the year and possibly more, depending 
on the needs of the family. CHWs will communicate directly with the behavioral health staff and 
case managers at Erie o n an as -needed basis for participants.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_162273] personal experience in their families with asthma. A 
cohort of 12 -15 candidates will complete an initial training (Phase 1, see next paragraph) which 
serves several purposes: 1) The training builds community  capacity and skills around asthma, 
2) It allows investigators to determine the best candidates for the position, 3) It provides a pool 
of back -up candidates for the future. [CONTACT_56559] has developed a comprehensive asthma CHW 
training curriculum 
(http://cuhe.rush.edu/Cura%202/Pages/CommunityHealthWorkerTraining.aspx ) which 
she will conduct in three phases. Phase [ADDRESS_162274] Aid course ( http://www.c4chicago.org/MHFA ). [CONTACT_142863] 
will then provide a follow -up session to discuss anticipated mental health challenges and how to 
obtain services for their particip ants. She will also train them in motivational interviewing. They 
will receive training on the Erie electronic medical record (EMR) system.  CHWs will shadow 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________   
Asthma Action at Erie Trial   Version 1 1 
Page 11 of 26   February 28, 2018  
  experienced CHWs on other projects for a minimum of 3 visits and they will shadow Erie 
clinicians for a minimum of 20 hours. Phase 3 is ongoing continual education. CHWs will attend 
local educational seminars ( www.chicagoasthma.org ) twice a year.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_162275] deal with the stresses of home visitation (safety, 
cleanliness, hectic households, and poverty). In order for CHWs to successfully perform  their 
job, they require adequate supervision and support. Supervision is best conducted using a team 
approach with a group of CHWs in order to facilitate self -discovery and group learning. In this 
trial, CHWs will report directly to the Erie AE -C for day -to-day supervision and support as 
needed. Every two weeks, CHWs and the Erie AE -C will also meet with [CONTACT_56559] and/or [CONTACT_142864] for discussion of clinical issues, self -management skills support, and for continuing 
education. [CONTACT_142863] or an Erie mental  health provider will meet with CHWs once a month to 
discuss mental health issues related to participants or the CHW job and to generate strategies 
for resolution.   
6.4 Comparison Arm:  Clinic -based AE -C Education  
6.4.1 AE -C Training:  Most candidates for the AE -C certification have prior experience as a n 
asthma educator and therefore require only a preparatory course to pass the certification exam.  
Erie leadership will identify the appropriate candidate for this position. This person will then 
complete a 2-day comprehensive workshop offered in Chicago by [CONTACT_142824][INVESTIGATOR_142806] ( www.lungchicago.org/certified -asthma -educator -training/ ).  If further training is 
required , an additional online course if available through the American Association of 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1511] ( www.aarc.org/education/asthma_  course). Once this person has passed 
the AE -C certification exam, he/she w ill complete a subsequent 2 -day training with the research 
investigators to familiarize him/her with the intervention expectations and protocol.  The AE -C 
may start delivery of intervention before obtaining formal AE -C certification as long as they have 
completed a training course and the study -specific training.  
6.4.2 AE -C Intervention Protocol : The AE -C will receive contact [CONTACT_142825] -C arm. The AE -C will schedule the 
participant ’s family to come in for an educational session in the clinic. At this visit, the AE -C will 
assess and educate on asthma symptoms, control, triggers, medication technique, adherence, 
presence of a written asthma plan, and he/she will address caregiver/chil d concerns. The AE -C 
will call the family on the telephone in 2 -4 weeks to discuss self -monitoring of symptoms and 
medication and answer any questions. The AE -C will schedule the participant’s family again to 
come in for a similar visit at [ADDRESS_162276] and Research Procedures  
The AE -C is considered “best practice” but is not routine care at Erie due to funding. For this 
study, the AE -C condition is subsidized by [CONTACT_142826] a  research procedure 
that will not be offered to intervention arm participants. CHW intervention is a research 
procedure. Both interventions will be documented in the medical record; support staff regularly 
document patient encounters in the record, making this standard procedure. The data collection 
is a research procedure.

Asthma Action at Erie Trial   Version 1 1 
Page 12 of 26   February 28, 2018  
  6.6 Fidelity and Process Measures:  Training : The CHWs will be assessed at the end of the 
trainings using role plays to determine that they have adequate knowledge and intervention 
delivery skills. The AE -C will have passed the National Asthma Education Certification Board 
(NAECB) examination. Deliver y: CHWs and the AE -C will complete documentation after every 
encounter to record curriculum topi[INVESTIGATOR_33722], resources utilized, and issues encountered after 
home and clinic visits.  These will be reviewed monthly by [CONTACT_142827]. The data will also be used in 
final analyses to determine “dose” of intervention and to assess the influence of specific 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]/skills on outcomes. Additionally, CHW and AE -C documentation in the  EMR will be 
reviewed quarterly to capture frequency of interactions between clinicians, CHWs and AE -C, 
behavioral health providers, and case management, and the topi[INVESTIGATOR_33722]. Home visits and 
clinic visits will be randomly tape recorded and reviewed by u nblinded staff to ensure 
intervention fidelity and accuracy of CHW/AE -C documentation.   
6.7. Retention:  Participants will be contact[CONTACT_142828]. We will obtain multiple alternative contacts at the time of  enrollment – friends, 
family, or others likely to keep  in touch with the participant and know their whereabouts. We can 
also search the clinic records for changes in address or telephone number. Incentive payments 
for data collection aid in retention. The  one source that will not be utilized will be the CHWs as 
this approach could lead to differential ascertainment of outcomes between the arms and 
introduce bias into the study.  
6.8. Outcomes:   
6.8.1. General Procedures  
Individual outcomes will be collected in the homes by  [CONTACT_142829]. Results will not be returned to 
participants or their clinicians in order to simulate routine clinical care as much as possible. 
Emergency plans will be implemented if outcomes are in critical ranges. For example, endorsin g 
a suicide plan will receive immediate intervention and appropriate referrals.   
6.8.2. Instruments  
The instruments and data domains are in the following table. All instruments have been 
validated, most with official Spanish validations as well. All instr uments will have both English 
and Spanish translations . Befor e the study begins, the RSs  will receive training sessions which 
will cover the procedures involved in data collection. The RSs will perform several “test” data 
collections in both English and Sp anish, where they will perform data collection with volunteers. 
The data collection process and instruments will be reviewed by [CONTACT_142830] - and inter -rater reliability. Problems with question accuracy and translations 
will be fixed.  
6.8.3. Saliva ry Cotinine Protocol:  
The salivary cotinine assay  will be performed by [CONTACT_142831]. Sekhar Reddy  and UIC Research Resource Center – [CONTACT_142865] . 
Equipment: bioquant ELIZA assay.  360/kit (96 wells), capped test tubes.

6.8.4. Mental Health Protocol:  
Part 1: In the home  – Research Specialists  
A mental health services list will be prepared that explains how to get mental health services at 
Erie, as well as other local resources. This will be given to all families.  
The UIC research specialist (RS) will administer all depression and trauma instruments either 
via a computer (handing the computer to  the participant to complete) or via a paper version with 
pen/pencil. All instruments will be in the preferred language. They will be instru cted to complete 
the questionnaire on their own but they can ask questions.  
The RS  will give the caregiver the PHQ -[ADDRESS_162278] will 
give the caregiver the PROMIS Parent Proxy question naire. The RS  will give the child t he CDI2 
Brief and the CROPS . There is no immediate scoring of these instruments. When the participant 
finishes completing the PHQ -9, the RS shoul d check to see if they answered 1, 2, or 3 on 
question 9.  If yes, then implement Suicide Protocol.  
Suicide Protocol : The RS will tell the participant the following statement: “ I feel that you may 
need to speak to someone immediately and I am going to mak e a phone call so that you can 
speak to a professional about how you are feeling.”   The RS will call the National Suicide 
Prevention Lifeline and ask the participant to talk with them: 1 -800-273-TALK (8255). If they are 
English -speaking, can call locally [ADDRESS_162279] this number.   
Part 2: After data collection  – Research Specialists  
The mental  health instruments should be scored within [ADDRESS_162280]. Weinstein of the scoring and action within 24 hours  of noting an 
elevated score . 
• PHQ -9: >=10   
• Short Form of the PTSD Checklist - Civilian Version: If score >= 14,  
• CDI2: If the scoring puts the child in the  Elevated to Very Elevated range  
 “This is from the Asthma Action at Erie Trial.  I was at your house a few days ago.  Some of the 
information we collected tells us that you have [your child has] been feeling somewhat sad and 
anxious.  Everyone fells sad or anxious sometimes but this usua lly only lasts a short time.  We 
are concerned that your [your child’s] feelings of sadness and anxiety are lasting too long and 
may be interfering in your [his/her] life.  Sometimes professional help from a counselor or a 
doctor can help a person feel hap pi[INVESTIGATOR_142807].  We recommend that you call one of the people 
listed on the mental health services list we gave you. The people there can talk to you more 
about this and get you help if you need it.”

Page 15 of 26   February 28, 2018  
  For enrolled children in elevated range: All enrolled c hildren are patients at Erie (see inclusion 
criteria) and therefore qualify for behavioral health services at Erie. If children are already 
receiving behavioral health services per caregiver report, the caregiver should be advised to talk 
with their provid er about the results of this screen. If children are not already receiving services, 
the caregiver should be advised to ask at Erie about receiving services.  
For caregivers in the elevated range: If caregivers are patients at Erie, they will be advised to 
seek behavioral health services from Erie. If they are already receiving services, they will be 
advised to talk with their provider about the results of this screen. If they are not patients at Erie, 
they will be referred to other providers on the mental h ealth services list.  
Part 3: Interventionists – AE-C and CHWs  
The AE -C and CHWs will not have access to the mental health screening results and they will 
not conduct formal mental health screening. If they develop concerns for the children or their 
caregiv ers in regards to mental health, they will encourage them to seek services using the 
mental health services list. If they already receive services, they will encourage them to talk with 
their provider. If the AE -C or CHW has strong concerns regarding an en rolled child, they will 
notify the child’s primary care provider to refer the child to the Erie Behavioral health program.  
6.8.[ADDRESS_162281] wi th participants in their homes. This study proposes the following:   
Mandatory reporting:  UIC and Erie staff are mandatory reporters of domestic abuse, child abuse 
and suicidal ideations.  If a CHW or RS witness or suspect any of these situations, they wil l call 
[ADDRESS_162282] suspi[INVESTIGATOR_142808], they will bring the 
concern directly to their supervisor.  The supervisor wil l review the situation, confer with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_142809], and determine if the police or Child Protective Services need to be notified.  If the 
supervisor decides the situation requires reporting, the supervisor or PI [INVESTIGATOR_142810].  This process will be stated in 
the consent form.  
Staff safety:  CHWs and RSs will usually visit homes alone but they will always have the option 
of being accompanied by a “sentry” for safety reasons.  If they feel  threatened or unsafe, they 
will not enter the home or they will leave the home.  They will then notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_142811].   
Participant safety : Partici pants will be informed at the start of the study that if they do not feel 
comfortable with their RS or CHW, they can refuse them entrance into their home.  Participants 
will be encouraged to notify the RS or project manager  if they are uncomfortable with t heir RS or 
CHW.  If this occurs, they will be offered the option of changing RSs or CHWs, or withdrawing 
from the study.   
Asthma safety: CHWs and RSs will be trained in the danger signs of asthma:  using albuterol 
inhaler more than every four hours, inabi lity to speak, severe cough, and severe wheeze. If they 
witness a participant with any of these danger signs, they will call [ADDRESS_162283] the participant’s 
family bring them to seek medical attention immediately.  CHWs and RSs will always have

7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits  
 Children and caregivers will be subject to only minimal risks throughout this trial. They 
may include inconvenience or embarrassment involved in completing questionnaires or 
demonstrating self -manag ement skills, or permitting the CHW (or research specialist ) to conduct 
home visits for interventions (or for assessments). The caregivers and children will not be 
required to answer any questions (or conduct any part of the study) that they are reluctant to 
discuss/conduct. There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality. The CHWs will not provide 
children or caregivers with any type of medical advice, but will have direct access to health care 
providers to address any child/caregiver clinical questions or  concerns. If the CHW is 
accidentally contact[CONTACT_142832], the CHW will connect the child/caregiver with a 
health care provider familiar with the participant’s medical condition immediately. On enrollment, 
caregivers will be instructed to cal l their health care provider or seek emergency services in 
case of worsening symptoms, as opposed to directing questions to the CHW. All participants will 
be informed in advance that they may withdraw from the study at any time without negatively 
affecting  their medical care or any other benefits they might receive.  
 We do not know if participants will benefit directly from the research process and we will 
not indicate there is a benefit to participating. One potential benefit is to the communities served 
by [CONTACT_142833]. Erie is very connected to the communities they serve. They are 
involved in local schools, events, and organizations. Promotion of research and asthma within 
Erie translates into promotion of research and ast hma in the community at large. The support of 
this grant and Erie will increase awareness and visibility for research and asthma.  
  
8.[ADDRESS_162285] will be provided by [CONTACT_36909] (DCC), 
which is comprised of staff and investigators from the Methodology Research Core in the 
Institute for Health Research and Policy at UIC. The DCC also serves as the Des ign and 
Analysis Core of the University of Illinois at Chicago Center for Clinical and Translational 
Science (CCTS) which is supposed by [CONTACT_142834] a Clinical and Translational Science 
Award as well as strong institutional commitment. The DCC has extensive experience in the 
acquisition, maintenance, and analysis of both large and small clinical trial databases. It is 
directed by [CONTACT_142835] a co -investigator on this proposal. The DCC faculty and 
staff are located in same offices as the o ther UIC investigators. Specific activities of the DCC 
include: collaborating with the study team to develop a comprehensive, yet efficient, set of case 
report forms to capture participant data, developi[INVESTIGATOR_142812], 
processing da ta, implementing and maintaining an effective study database and its associated 
query system, maintaining a computer environment sophisticated enough to efficiently, 
effectively, and securely manage the study database, and developi[INVESTIGATOR_142813], participant follow -up, and intervention 
delivery.  The DCC is part of the research team which supports the ready exchange of any 
needed resources. The DCC will also implement the randomization processes.  Access to 
randomization assignment data will be limited to pertinent DCC staff, intervention staff, and 
investigators as needed. Outcomes assessors are to remain blind to study arm.  
Data acquisition and maintenance  
All interviewer administered questionna ire data will be collected on computers (by [CONTACT_142836]) with the possible exception of the mental health instruments. The mental 
health instruments are to be self -administered for privacy; families will be offered the computer 
but they wil l be collected on paper case report forms if caregivers and/or children are 
uncomfortable answering the questions on the computers. Electronic data collected in the field 
will be on encrypted computers (see below). Paper forms will be transported to the In stitute for 
Health Research and Policy where outcomes assessors will enter them into the computer data 
collection program and then store the paper forms in a locked storage cabinet.  
All data will be kept confidential, and no subject will be identifiable f rom research records or 
published data. We will employ procedures used in other studies to maintain anonymity. All 
identifying information will be removed from the provider self -report data and all data sheets will 
be coded with ID numbers only. Tracking i nformation will be stored separately from data files, 
and access to tracking information will be limited to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27235]. The master list of 
ID code numbers and corresponding names will be kept in a locked file cabinet or in a password 
protect ed file on an internal server, with close scrutiny of access maintained by [CONTACT_978]. The 
master list is used only to coordinate data collection.  
Data will be entered using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is a secure, 
web-based application for building and managing online databases for the collection and entry 
of research data. It is a valuable resource that allows for the creation of web -based databases 
quickly and securely, with special features like ad -hoc reporting and scheduling. It is fast and 
flexible with an easy to use design environment to create data capture forms. The program was 
developed by [CONTACT_142837] 2004 in order to help researchers manage data for 
small/medium sized projects in a systematic manner (meta data defined, secure, audit trails, 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________   
Asthma Action at Erie Trial   Version 1 1 
Page 18 of 26   February 28, 2018  
  etc). The system is continually updated and enhanced by [CONTACT_142838]. REDCap is maintained by [CONTACT_142839].  
REDCap is designed to minimize data errors. The DCC will develop quality assur ance checks 
that will be implemented at the time data are entered as an assurance of data accuracy.  
Erroneous and/or inconsistent values will prompt generation of an entry to a query report that 
will be developed for this study.  Query reports will be gen erated weekly and distributed to study 
staff for resolution.  Once generated, a query will remain part of the weekly report until it is 
resolved.  
The RedCap Survey website and database is hosted by [CONTACT_142840] (IHRP).  RedC ap is an IRB approved web data collection tool. The REDCap server is 
behind a firewall, has virus protection, uses Secure Socket Layer authentication to encrypt 
communication between a user and the server, and has been configured to meet campus 
HIPPA rules . This means that the Internet connection between a user’s browser and REDCap is 
encrypted, but REDCap is not encrypted on the server on which it resides, nor is any data 
downloaded and saved to a computer or other storage device encrypted unless a user ta kes 
steps to encrypt the stored file using third party software.  All data collected through RedCap is 
stored on a secured MySQL database server.  The database server does not have an externally 
translatable IP address and access to the server is controlled  by [CONTACT_142841]. 
Permission controls and passwords will assure that only authorized personnel will have the 
ability to access study data.   Account creation to the Redcap web server is managed by [CONTACT_142842], project access is controlled by [CONTACT_142843].  The DCC will work with study staff to ensure accurate transfer of data to the DCC.   
Additional data collection procedures are described in Section 6.8. Data instruments are in the 
table in Section  6.8. Biologic  specimens (saliva) will be stored in a freezer at UIC  until they are 
sent to the allergy lab for analysis. After analysis, the samples will be destroyed.  
 
9.0 Data Analysis  
 All analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_142844] 9.4. We will compare key population descriptors in the 
two treatment groups as patient recruitment progresses (at N=100 and N =150) to ensure that 
the randomization process is achieving reasonable balance, being careful to protect operational 
staff from bias. Basic summary statistics will be calculated for outcome variables and covariates. 
Continuous variables will be assessed fo r normality using Q -Q plots and compared using [ADDRESS_162286] will be used. Categorical variables will be compared using chi -square tests. 
Significance t ests will be two -sided at level α=0.05.  
Specific Aim 1 : To assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention 
relative to the AE -C intervention at [ADDRESS_162287] -randomization as demonstrated by [CONTACT_142845]. This study will employ two p rimary measures of asthma control: number of days with 
activity limitation over the previous [ADDRESS_162288]/childhood Asthma 
Control Test (ACT/cACT) . The mean total number of days with activity limitation over the 
previous [ADDRESS_162289] 30% lower than that of the AE -C arm and p < 0.05, we will conclude 
that the CHW intervention is more effective. The ACT/cACT  will be analyzed using similar 
methods; a MID of 0. [ADDRESS_162290] the CHW 
intervention's efficacy on these outcomes, we will first conduct per protocol analyses limited to 
those patients who received CHW intervention. We will correct  potential selection bias by 
[CONTACT_142846]. Under the missing at 
random (MAR) assumption, this ensures unbiased estimates from linear mixed models. 
Additionally, to test the intervention's effective ness in clinical practice we will conduct intention -
to-treat analyses that include outcomes for all patients randomized. Nonadherent and other 
subgroups of patients can be expected to exhibit differentially higher rates of missing data. We 
will therefore e xamine the sensitivity of inferences to multiple imputation rule using the SAS 
macros of Little and Yau (1996), including last observation carried forward (LOCF), return to 
baseline, and continuing on apparent trajectory. The fixed -effects part of the mode l will be 
Days ij= β 0 + β 1Time ij + β 2Txi + β 3(Tx i*Time ij) + ε ij, for subject i at visit j. Candidate covariance 
structures will be assessed using the data’s correlation structure and Akaike’s Information 
Criterion (AIC). A random intercept will be included in the model if it significantly improves the 
model fit as determined by [CONTACT_142847]. Standardized residuals and Cook’s distance 
will be used to assess the influence of outliers and individual observations and residual plots will 
be used to c heck the multivariate normal distribution assumption. These analyses will be 
conducted in SAS PROC MIXED (and PROC GLIMMIX for categorical outcomes), and will be 
followed by [CONTACT_142848]. Potentially 
confound ing covariates will be considered for model inclusion using the least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator ( LASSO) model selection method. This method identifies a significant 
subgroup of covariates that will form a more parsimonious model. The LASSO method avoids 
problems typi[INVESTIGATOR_142814]. To accommodate potential age -
specific effects, heterogeneity of treatment effects by [CONTACT_142849].  
Specific Aim 2:  To assess maintenance of intervent ion efficacy, at [ADDRESS_162291] -randomization as described above for Specific Aim 1. An 
indicator variable, to be named “Phase”, will be added to the models to allow distinction 
between the time during intervention periods. The model will be: Y it = β 0 + β 1Time ij + β 2Txi + 
β3(Tx i * Time ij) + γ 1Phase j * (Time ij – 12) + γ 2Txi * Phase j * (Time ij – 12) + ϵij. We will conclude 
that any intervention effect is sustained if the slope for γ 2Time after [ADDRESS_162292] effectiveness of the interventions.  The analysis 
will be conducted from the societal perspective, including the costs borne by [CONTACT_78311], 
individual participant and family, and healthcare system. 1) Cost and resource use information 
will be collected for the program, participant, and healthcare utilization. 2) Efficacy will be 
measured as asthma cont rol as described for Specific Aim 1. 3) Cost effectiveness will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_142850]. We 
will calculate the ICER for the CHW home intervention compared to AE -C services, such that 
ICER t = (C 1 – C0) / (E 1t – E0t), where C is cost and E is effectiveness. Subscript 1 denotes CHW 
home intervention and subscript 0 denotes usual asthma care. t denotes the time period: 12 
months, 18 months and 24 months. 95% confidence intervals for the ICERs w ill be calculated to 
evaluate the uncertainty in these results. 4)  We will conduct one -way and multi -way sensitivity 
analyses for the key parameters to evaluate whether the ICERs are sensitive to plausible 
changes in their values. The sensitivity analysis  is a check on the robustness and will determine 
the key parameters impacting the ICERs.

  Specific Aim 4:  To assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention 
among those experiencing depression, stress, and/or PTSD. Interaction terms betwe en 
treatment indicators for depression, stress, and PTSD will be examined to test for heterogeneity 
of treatment effects.  
 
10.0 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
Intervention fidelity procedures are described in Section 6.6. The MRC will develop quali ty 
assurance checks that will be implemented at the time data are entered as an assurance of data 
accuracy.  Erroneous and/or inconsistent values will prompt generation of an entry to a query 
report that will be developed for this study.  Query reports wil l be generated weekly and 
distributed to study staff for resolution.  Once generated, a query will remain part of the weekly 
report until it is resolved.   
 
11.[ADDRESS_162293] ( DSMB) has been  created to provide oversight for the proposed 
trial. We have a  [ADDRESS_162294] ed one of the members to 
serve as the Chair and another to serve as Executive Secretary. DSMB  members and their 
expertise are as follows:  
- Marissa Feldman, PhD ; Medical Psychologist, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7726] (h ealth psychologist )  
- Saria Awadalla, PhD: University of Illinois at the School of Public Health 
(Biostatistician )  
- Brad Appelhans, PhD, Associate Professor, Rush University Medical Center  
(behavioral intervention researcher and health psychologist)  
- Kameron Matthews, MD, JD; Ch ief Medical Officer, Mile Square Health Center 
(federally -qualified health center administrator)  
- Geisel Collazo, MD, Mile Square Health Center  (community pediatrician)  
- Cortland Lohff, MD, Medical Director, Public Health  and Safety Division, Department 
of Public Health , City of Chicago, Illinois (local health expert)  
 
The data management team will report directly to the DSMB chairperson at their request 
or every 12 months. The DSMB will make an affirmative decision at each meeting whether to 
continue or terminate the study. Early termination is an option for the DSMB, particularly if there 
are serious concerns about patient safety or there is evidence of futility or sufficient evidence of 
efficacy; decisions  regarding early termination will be made by [CONTACT_4318]. No interim analyses 
of outcomes for efficacy or futility are planned. In general, the DSMB will be provided data 
grouped by [CONTACT_142851] (i.e., masked to treatment 
assignment). If the DSMB requests, for the purpose of competent deliberation, to see the 
treatment assignments (by [CONTACT_142852]), these will be provided by [CONTACT_142853]. 
The investigators will remain masked to the treatment assignments of in dividual patients unless 
it is judged that it is in the best interests of an individual patient.  
11.2. Adverse events (AEs) and Unanticipated Problems (UPs)  
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will work with study staff to monitor any AEs and UPs that 
occur  among participants of the proposed study. The two primary risks are: 1) confidentiality 
(protection of data, especially sensitive data collected in home); and 2) mental health risk (not 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________   
Asthma Action at Erie Trial   Version 1 1 
Page 21 of 26   February 28, 2018  
  from the intervention, but assessments query for risks of harm to sel f or others). Confidentiality 
risks are managed by [CONTACT_142854]. 
Mental health risks are managed as indicated on the Mental Health Protocol (See section 
6.8.4).Adverse events will be reported immediat ely to the Safety Officer ([CONTACT_142866]).  When 
indicated, the Safety Officer will inform the Principal Investigator, IRB, DSMB, Compliance 
Office, and/or NIH.  Action to protect participant safety and privacy will be taken. Serious and 
non-serious AEs will  be reported by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_142815] [ADDRESS_162295] will be provided by [CONTACT_142855] (MRC) in 
the Institute for Health Research and Policy at UIC. The MRC also serves as the Design and 
Analy sis Core of the University of Illinois at Chicago Center for Clinical and Translational 
Science (CCTS) which is supported  by [CONTACT_142834] a Clinical and Translational Science 
Award as well as strong institutional commitment. The MRC has extensive ex perience in the 
acquisition, maintenance, and analysis of both large and small clinical trial databases. It is 
directed by [CONTACT_142835] a co -investigator on this proposal. The MRC faculty and 
staff are located in same offices as the other UIC inv estigators. Specific activities of the MRC 
include: collaborating with the study team to develop a comprehensive, yet efficient, set of case 
report forms to capture participant data, developi[INVESTIGATOR_142812], 
processing data, implemen ting and maintaining an effective study database and its associated 
query system, maintaining a computer environment sophisticated enough to efficiently, 
effectively, and securely manage the study database, and developi[INVESTIGATOR_142816], participant follow -up, and intervention 
delivery.  The MRC is part of the research team which supports the ready exchange of any 
needed resources. The MRC will also implement the randomization processes. Access to 
randomization assignment data will be limited to pertinent MRC staff (who have no interaction 
with participants) and designated study personnel who are responsible for ensuring participant 
safety.  
11.4. Data Storage  
See Section 8.0.  
11.5 Data Release  
A well -documented and appropriately accessible archive of study data is an important resource 
that will result from this study. The research team recognizes the need to share final data from 
the study with the larger scientific community.  The Asthma Action at E rie Trial recognizes the 
requirements of data sharing set forth by [CONTACT_18121]. Three years after the end of clinical activity or 
two years after the main paper of the trial has been published (whichever comes first), data will 
be publically released. Data set s from the Trial will be stripped of all protected personal health 
information (PHI) to allow sharing of data without compromising participant confidentiality, 
privacy, and safety.  All identification covered under HIPAA will be removed.  All remaining 
variables not covered under HIPAA will be evaluated in terms of the risk of deductive disclosure 
of identity, and appropriate measures will be taken to protect confidentiality. The striped data, in 
partnership with the community clinical partner, will be sent  to the NIH Program Officer for public 
release. In order to ensure responsible usage of study data, user registration will be required in 
order to access or download data files.  Registered users will receive technical assistance with 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________   
Asthma Action at Erie Trial   Version 1 1 
Page 22 of 26   February 28, 2018  
  questions or problems  from the Methodology Research Core at the University of Illinois at 
Chicago’s Institute for Health Research and Policy.  A data sharing agreement will be required 
that will describe the conditions and restrictions of their use; limited data access will be  made 
available only to users who successfully complete a rigorous approval process by [CONTACT_142856].  Data sets will be encrypted for transfer to approved 
investigators.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_162296] for assessing asthma control. The Asthma Control Questionnaire 
(ACQ) has been validated in diverse, large samples but currently there is an absence of 
substantive data on this test (data such as variability and rea sonable effect sizes within this 
target population) upon which statistical power and sample size estimates can be based. 
Therefore we have conducted two calculations to ensure adequate power. Using the ACQ, a 
sample size of 100 per group (total N=200) had power 0.[ADDRESS_162297] the minimally important 
difference (MID) of 0.[ADDRESS_162298].14 We performed a separate power calculation 
using number of days with activity limitation (over the past 14 -days) as Zeiger et al.42 found 
“activity limitation”  to be a strong determinant of the composite asthma control score. In a multi -
site inner -city (including Chicago) randomized trial of a home CHW asthma intervention, Morgan 
et al. reported activity limitations over the previous 14 day period.43 Based on th eir data, we 
hypothesize a mean of 3.9 “activity limitation” days at baseline in both groups (SE 0.22) and, in 
the AE -C comparison group, a mean at 12 months of 2.84 days (SE 0.10). We anticipate the 
proposed CHW intervention will be more potent than that tested by [CONTACT_142857]. because it 
involves a higher dose and more physician involvement. Within the proposed CHW home 
intervention group, we anticipate a mean of 2 “activity limitation” days over a 14 -day period at 12 
months (SE 0.10), representing a 30% reduction from the AE -C comparison group (and 50% 
reduction from the baseline mean). Further assuming an attrition rate of 15% and 80% power, 
the standard two -group t -test for comparing means (at 12 months) requires a sample size of 
about [ADDRESS_162299] more limited power but results will be 
considered suggestive for further research.  
 
13.0 Regulatory Requirements  
 
13.1 Informed Consent   
Written informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_142858]. Before signing the consent, the RS  will review the entire 
document and study protocol. They will answer all questions and ensure the caregiver 
understands the protocol and consent document. The RS  will be bilingual in English and 
Spanish and all documents will be available in both languages. The protocol for informed 
consent for Spanish -speakers is the same therefore as for English -speakers.  
Assen t will be obtained from all children capable of reading and understanding 
the written assent document. The RS will explain the study protocol using the assent 
document to ensure the child understands what the document says and what the 
protocol entails. Th e caregiver will be present during this process.

  The RS will complete human subjects training using the online Citi course at UIC. 
They will practice obtaining informed consent with volunteers/study staff under the 
observation of the project manager and/or  investigators unless mastery of the process is 
confirmed.  
Signed informed consent/assent documents will be stored in locked cabinets in 
the Institute for Health Research and Policy. The RS , the project manager, and the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_142817] s.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_162300] confidentiality will be maintained. 
No Certificates of Confidentiality will be r equired.

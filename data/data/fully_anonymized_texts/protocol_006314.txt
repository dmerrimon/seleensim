1.1 Introduction  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_538971], the prognosis of incurable lung and non- colorectal 
gastrointestinal cancers remains poor with median survivals of less than one year.1 During the 
course of illness, these patients often experience marked physical suffering, psychological  
distress and resource- intensive care at the end -of-life (EOL).2,3 While cancer treatment may 
extend survival, the improvement on quality -of-life (QOL) and distress is minimal for these 
patients.[ADDRESS_702373] -certified palliative care physicians and advanced 
practice nurses who conducted their clinic visits in the Cancer Center and on the same day  as 
the patients’ oncology visit.  Patients were scheduled for visits with the palliative care team at a 
minimum of every three weeks, although more frequent visits were permitted.  If patients were 
admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], they were also followed by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]-based inpatient palliative care 
team throughout their admission. We observed significant improvements in patient reported 
outcomes (QOL, mood and illness understanding) and several key measures of quality EOL care 
and resource utilization (chemoth erapy near death, documentation of EOL care preferences, and 
length of stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]).11-14 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_538972], patients assigned to early palliative care (PC) had prolonged survival of over two months, c ompared with patients receiving standard care. While these results are exciting, this 
study was a single institution study and it is unclear if these findings will be reproduced in a multi-site trial. 
Recently, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (AS CO) published a Provisional Clinical 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_538973].
[ADDRESS_702374] 
assembled a team with significant experience in conducting early palliative care trials (Temel, 
Jackson, Greer) and in completing supportive care interventions in the cooperative group 
(Loprinzi ). 
1.2 Rationale and Significance 
Symptom burden in patients with incurable lung and gastrointestinal cancer and their families: 
Patients with incurable solid tumors experience high rates of both physical and psychological distress.
16,17 Symptoms such as pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and nausea lead to a poor QOL and are 
associated with high rates of depression and anxiety.18 The family members of these patients 
also frequently experience emotional, physical and financial distress when caring for loved ones with incurable cancers.
19,20 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_538974], life expectancy remains limited for 
Alliance A221303 
7 
NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #06  patients with incurable malignancies, such as lung and non- colorectal gastrointestinal (GI) 
cancer, which account for more than half of cancer -related deaths in men and one -third in 
women.21-[ADDRESS_702375] on the suffering of patients with poor 
prognosis cancers and their family caregivers.  
Aggressive cancer  care at the end -of-life: Oncology care for patients with incurable cancer is 
becoming increasingly aggressive with greater use of multiple anti- cancer regimens and 
administration of chemotherapy near the EOL.[ADDRESS_702376] increased as well.
31,32 Unfortunately, aggressive medical treatment at the EOL fails to improve 
survival in patients with incurable cancer and correlates negatively with family caregivers’ perceptions of the quality of EOL care.
3,33,34 Such care also places family caregivers at increased 
risk of major depression and complicated bereavement.3 Since U.S. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_538975] -cancer therapy, administration of chemotherapy and 
inpatient stays at the EOL often interrupt or delay referrals  to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249].3,35,36 Late referral 
to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_538976].
37 Specifically, family members of patients who receive hospi[INVESTIGATOR_538977], but also experience improved psychological and physical health outcomes, compa red with those caring for patients 
who do not receive hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125].
38 Thus, the American Society of Clinical Oncology Quality 
Oncology Practice Initiative (ASCO QOPI) has recognized several key metrics for determining high quality EOL care including: no chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life, referral to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_538978] > 3 days.
39 
End-of-life decision -making in advanced cancer : The majority of patients with advanced cancer 
and their families report a desire to receive timely and realistic prognostic information.40-[ADDRESS_702377] oncology care (82% compared to 59%, 
respectively).47 Importantly, patients’ understanding of their illness and prognosis strongly 
predicts treatment decision -making at the EOL.48-[ADDRESS_702378] of early palliative care  on symptom burden, quality -of-life and end-of- life care: The 
benefits of palliative care in the inpatient setting are well established in the literature.9,[ADDRESS_702379] studied 
Alliance A221303

NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #06  a more clinically based integrated service model in which palliative and oncology care provide 
simultaneous care throughout the course of illness. After completing a pi[INVESTIGATOR_538979], we per formed a randomized controlled trial in patients with incurable 
lung cancer, observing significant improvements in QOL and quality of care at the end-of-life.
11,53 We are currently performing a similar study in a broader population of patients with 
advanced thoracic and gastrointestinal cancers. In addition to assessing many patient-reported 
and health care utilization measures, we are collecting abundant qualitative and quantitative data on the nature of the palliative care service in the outpatient care s etting. This information will 
allow us to study the early palliative care model in a multi- site trial. 
1.3 Hypotheses  
Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of early, integrated palliative care (PC) on patient and family 
caregiver reported outcomes in those with  newly diagnosed incurable lung or non- colorectal 
gastrointestinal cancer.  
• Hypotheses 1: Compared to patients receiving standard care (SC), patients receiving early PC will (1) experience improved QOL and fewer depressive symptoms; and (2) report a more accurate understanding of their terminal illness and the goals of care.  
• Hypotheses 2: Compared to family caregivers in the SC arm, family caregivers of patients receiving early PC will (1) experience improved QOL and fewer depressive symptoms throughout the course of the patient’s illness; and (2) report a more accurate understanding 
of the patient’s terminal illness and the goals of care.  
Aim 2: To assess the impact of early, integrated PC on quality of EOL care and resource 
utilization in patients with newly diagnosed incurable lung or non- colorectal gastrointestinal 
cancer 
• Hypotheses: Compared to patients receiving SC, patients receiving early PC will (1) receive 
higher quality EOL care (i.e., less chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life, greater utilizati on 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249], and/or length of stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125] > 3 days); (2) experience less hospi[INVESTIGATOR_538980] (3) have at least the same survival as patients receiving standard care  
1.[ADDRESS_702380] oncology care alone. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion between 
study arms. The dynamic allocation procedure was adopted to balance the marginal distributions 
of stratification: tumo r type (lung vs. esophageal/gastric vs. hepatic/biliary/pancreatic/ unknown 
primary), and family caregiver participation (yes vs. no).
56 We modeled this study design to be 
identical to the completed and ongoing trial at the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ( MGH) 
Cancer Center. We are not randomizing by [CONTACT_3725] (i.e. cluster -randomized design) due to several 
reasons: (1) Although such a design would reduce contamination effects, it introduces site effects that could also impact outcomes; (2) In both of our prior trials, there was minimal 
contamination with few patients in the standard care arm referred for PC in the outpatient care 
setting; and (3) Within Alliance, ensuring equivalent sites across geographical regions with the 
same PC resources would be challengin g. We have also decided not to include an attention 
control group as the logistical and sample size requirements for a third study arm would be substantial. Additionally, the observed clinical benefits of PC in our previous investigation did 
not appear to be merely due to increased clinician time with patients and families but related to 
the expertise of PC clinicians. We anticipate including approximately [ADDRESS_702381] 15 patients per site.  
Alliance A221303

NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #[ADDRESS_702382]- certified 
physicians and/or advanced practice nurses and will focus on the following areas: (1) developi[INVESTIGATOR_538981]; (2) 
assessing and treating patient symptoms; (3) providing support and reinforcement of copi[INVESTIGATOR_538982]; (4) assessing and enhancing prognostic 
awareness and illness understanding in patients and family caregivers; (5) assisting with 
treatment decision -making; and (6) end -of-life care planning. 
Palliative care services in the community are likely to be highly variable and there are no standard practices for outpatient palliative care at this time. Thus, to promote the use of more 
uniform palliative care practices for patients at the differing study sites, the PC service from 
each participating institution will be required to meet specific eligibility requirements and at a minimum, the lead PC member will be required to complete two web- based training courses on 
providing palliative care services to patients.  
We have included minimum requirements for participating palliative care services in Section 12.1 under ‘Institutional credentialing’ to be as inclusive as possible. Also, to ensure reproducible and measurable intervention, study sites will be provided with guidelines for the 
palliative care visits in the form of  a manual, which is based on our previous studies. The data 
used to generate this manual, revealed six key elements of PC visits (relationship and rapport building, addressing symptoms, addressing copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], establishing illness understanding, 
discussing cancer treatments, end -of-life planning and engagement family members).

Palliative care clinicians participating in this study are required to follow th e guidance and 
instructions for the palliative care intervention as detailed in the ‘Early Integration of 
Palliative and Oncology Care: An Intervention Manual’ as Appendix I of this protocol. 
Please refer to this manual for guidance regarding the implement ation of the palliative care 
intervention, as well as, the training requirements for administering palliative care for the 
PC team at each study site. These guidelines should be reviewed prior to initiating this trial.  
Palliative care clinicians will be re quired to:  
1. Review the ‘Early Integration of Palliative and Oncology Care: An Intervention Manual’ in its entirety; and  
2. At least one leader of the outpatient palliative care clinic must complete registration with CTEP (see Sections 4.1 and 4.2) , if not currently registered ;  
3. At least one leader of the outpatient palliative care clinic must complete the two 
web-based training courses, each approximately 1 -hour in length: 
• Site Staff: Palliative Care Training Video One

NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #06  7.0 INTERVENTION  
During registration, patients will be randomized to receive either early palliative care (Arm 1) or 
standard oncology care (Arm 2).  
Over the course of the study patients and their family caregivers in both arms will be asked to 
complete questionnaires about quality -of-life, mood, and their perception of prognosis and treatment 
goals during regularly scheduled oncology clinical visits at baseline and week 6, 12, and 24 visits.  
7.1 Early Palliative Care Arm  
The intervention will be comprised of one baseline visit and palliative care visits or phone calls (if a clinic visit is not feasible)  at least every four weeks  throughout t he patient’s life.  
7.1.1 Day of Registration   
• Patient and family caregiver will be asked to complete baseline self -report 
questionnaires. See Appendices II and III, respectively, for questionnaires.  
7.1.2 Subsequent Medical Oncology/Infusion Visits  
• A PC clinician will meet with patients randomized to early PC within one month of 
registration. This should be done at the patient’s next medical oncology or infusion visit 
following registration.  
• The PC clinician will meet with patients and family caregivers ( if present at the 
appointments) at a minimum of every four weeks in the outpatient care setting (oncology clinic or infusion suite). PC visits will be coordinated with regularly 
scheduled cancer center appointments to reduce burden of multiple hospi[INVESTIGATOR_538984].  
• If patients are unable to come to the clinic for a scheduled PC visit, at least one attempt 
will be made to reschedule the visit within seven days of the scheduled PC visit.  If a 
rescheduled in -person visit is not feasible, the PC clinician will con duct the visit over 
the telephone and document the content and nature of the visit in the medical record. Clinic visits are strongly preferred to telephone visits and should be attempted as much 
as possible.  
• Patients, family caregivers, or the PC team may initiate consultations as needed.  
• PC clinicians should follow the guidelines as detailed in Appendix I.  
• Depending on clinic space, workflow, and patient preference, PC clinicians may see patients in the clinic or in the chemotherapy infusion room. 
• If a patient is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371899], they should be seen at 
least once by [CONTACT_539044][INVESTIGATOR_538985]. Additional follow up during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_538986].  
7.1.3 Completion of Study Measures  
Patients and family caregivers will be asked to complete quality -of-life questionnaires at 
weeks 6, 12, and 24. See Appendices II and III, respectively. A 2- week window, before and 
after each time point, for completion of the self -report questionnaires will be allowed. For 
example, the 12- week time point can be completed by [CONTACT_539045] 1 0 through 14. 
Alliance A221303

NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #[ADDRESS_702398] of questionnaire assessment only as outlined 
below. 
7.2.1 Day of Registration  
Patient and family caregiver will be asked to complete baseline self -report questionnaires. 
See Appendices II and III, respectively for questionnaires.  
7.2.2 Subsequent Medical Oncology/Infusion Visits   
After patients and family caregivers have been enrolled, the patient will meet with the treating oncologist(s) for the patient’s standard treatm ent visit activities without the 
scheduled study intervention of palliative care. 
Patients and family caregivers may consult with PC clinicians at  their request or at the 
discretion of their treating oncologist. In such instances, individual PC clinicians will follow 
standard oncology participants per their clinical judgment, rather than according to the 
required time intervals for study patients receiving the early palliative care intervention.  
7.2.3 Completion of Study Measures  
Patient and family caregiv er will be asked to complete self- report questionnaires at weeks 
6, 12, and 24. See Appendices II and III, respectively, for questionnaires. A 2- week window, 
before and after each time point, for completion of the self -report questionnaires will be 
allowed. 
7.3 Duration of Intervention  
The intervention will end when the patient is deceased. Submission of patient and caregiver -
provided assessments will end with the completion of week 24 assessments.  
7.4 Duration of Follow -Up 
Survival follow -up will be every 4 months from week 24 until death or up to 3 years (with chart 
abstraction at death, per section 6.4).  Chart abstraction will be performed at year 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_702399] been no adverse events reported for the intervention.  
If patients or family caregivers experience any emotional discomfort when completing the 
questionnaires, they may choose not to complete them and/or speak with the site staff. Patients 
experiencing any physical or psychological complications as related to their standa rd care treatment 
should discuss this with their treating physician.  
9.0 M EASURES  
Demographics : All study participants will complete a demographic questionnaire (see Appendix III 
for patient, Appendix IV for family caregiver) at the time of baseline data collection detailing their 
age, sex, race, ethnicity, religion, relationship status, education level, annual household income, and living situation (specify number of dependent children living at home). Family caregivers will also 
specify their relationshi p with the patient, living situation (specify number of dependent children 
living at home) and employment status.

NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #06  QOL-Patient: To assess quality of life over time in study patients, we will use the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Questionnaires, which have been validated for use in 
multiple care settings and with diverse tumor types. The FACT consists of four subscales assessing 
well-being across four domains (physical, functional, emotional and social) during the prior seven 
days. Additional questions specific to cancer symptoms will be added to the measure for each tumor type, including lung (FACT -L), esophageal and gastric (FACT -E), and hepatic, biliary, and 
pancreatic (FACT -Hep) – See Appendix III.
58-61 Patients will complete this question naire at baseline, 
6, 12 and 24 weeks. 
QOL-Family caregiver: We will use short -form health survey (SF -36) to assess change in health -
related QOL over time in family caregivers (see Appendix IV).62 The SF-36 measures eight domains 
of health- related quality -of-life: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily 
pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional health, and mental health. Family caregivers will complete this questionnaire at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks.  
Mood: We will use the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) to assess symptoms of 
depression and anxiety in all study participants (see Appendix III for patient, Appendix IV for family 
caregiver).[ADDRESS_702400] week. Scores on each subscale range from 0 to 21, with a cutoff of 8 or greater denoting clinically significant depression or anxiety symptoms. Patients 
and family caregivers will complete questionnaire at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. 
Prognosis and Treatment Perceptions Questionnaire : [CONTACT_254716] has evaluated the content validity 
and readability of a thirteen- item Prognosis and Treatment Perceptio n Questionnaire (PTPQ) to 
assess perceptions of prognosis, goals of treatment, and quality of communication with oncologists among patients with incurable cancer (see Appendix III for patient, Appendix IV for family caregiver). The PTPQ was recently used to assess illness and prognostic understanding in patients 
with advanced gastrointestinal cancers.
64  We will administer the PTPQ to patients and their family 
caregivers in order to assess (1) illness knowledge and understanding; (2) communication and perceptions regarding prognosis and goals of care; and (3) discussions and preferences regarding 
EOL care.  Patients and family caregivers will complete this questionnaire at 6, 12, and 24 weeks.  
10.0 E ND OF INTERVENTION  
10.1 Duration of Intervention  
The patient  case evaluations will continue until the patient is deceased.  
10.2 Early Withdrawal 
Patients and/or family caregivers may request early withdrawal from the study.  Research staff 
will inquire regarding the reason for withdrawal and document the date and reason in the case 
report form.  If patients assigned to the intervention arm request withdrawal due to a preference to discontinue palliative care visits, the research staff will inquire if they are still willing to 
complete questionnaires and allow us to  access their medical records.  If patients assigned to the 
intervention arm request withdrawal due to the questionnaires, they will still be permitted to see 
the palliative care clinician as per their preference.  The research staff will ask for continued  
permission to access their medical records.  Similarly, if patients assigned to the standard care arm request withdrawal due to the questionnaires, the research staff will ask for continued 
permission to access their medical records.

was the difference detected between arms in our previous study.65 Enrolling 140 patients per 
study arm will provide 80% power to detect at least a 4 -point change from baseline to week

sample t-test with at 5% significance level.  
Based on our previous palliative care study, the rate of missing data for primary endpoint patient-reported measures was approximately 20 -30%. We will therefore increase our

in sequence, and the subsequent analysis (hypothesis testing) will only be carried out if the previous analysis is statistically significant. Otherwise, subsequent analysis will be 
descriptive in nature. Multiplicity will not be adjusted for other secondary analyses, hence, 
statistically significant findings from secondary analyses are exploratory in nature and 
therefore shall be interpreted as such. Descriptive statistics and graphical approaches will form the basis for most secondary analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS] To assess the changes in QOL  over time among patients, generalized linear model 
with repeated measures will be used for comparison between treatment arms.  To 
compare rates of psychological distress between treatment arms, we will transform the HADS score into a dichotomous outcome wi th categories reflecting the presence 
or absence of clinically significant depression and anxiety. We will then use generalized linear models with repeated measures to assess the association between 
the presence of depression/anxiety and study arm, using r isk difference and relative 
risk to compare proportions between the study arms.  To compare the illness 
understanding, we will analyze each item of the PTPQ separately using the appropriate test to determine the significance of the between -group differences . To 
assess additional measures of family caregiver perceptions of quality of death, we will employ the Jonckheere -Terpstra test, which is appropriate for contingency tables 
with ordinal data.  
[IP_ADDRESS] To assess the changes in QOL among family caregivers, we will use the similar 
approach as for QOL among patients. Change in the total score and subscales will be 
compared with generalized linear models with repeated measures. Analysis of psychological distress and illness understanding will be the same as abo ve. 
[IP_ADDRESS] To assess differences in quality of EOL care, we will use Fisher’s exact test to determine the association between the composite EOL care measure categories and study arm and a comparison of rates between the groups based on the risk differenc e 
and relative risk.  To assess the difference in resource utilization, we will also 
compare days on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_538988]- Whitney U 
test. To compare patient survival, we will use Kaplan -Meier estimates, testing the 
difference between the curves with the log -rank test. 
[IP_ADDRESS] To assess the concordance between patient and family caregiver report of prognosis/curability, we will analyze each of the primary and secondary endpoints 
using the matched -pair subset. Simple tests such as paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed-
rank test, and generalized linear models for matched pair data will be utilized.

Testing the addition of early palliative care to usual cancer care in patients with 
incurable lung or non -colorectal gastrointestinal cancers  
 
Official Study Title for Internet Search on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov : 
(Randomized Study of Early Palliative Care Integrated with Standard 
Oncology Care versus Standard Oncology Care Alone in Patients with 
Incurable Lung or Non -Colorectal Gastrointestinal Malignancies)  
 
What is the usual approach to my incurable lung or non- colorectal gastrointestinal cancer?  
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have incurable lung or non- colorectal 
gastrointestinal cancer.  When patients are diagnosed with advanced cancer, their oncology doctors 
and nurses usually provide most of their care.  At a later time, when their disease worsens and they develop more symptoms, they may also be referred to doctors and nurse who specialize in palliative care.  
 If you are not familiar with the term “palliative care”, this refers to doctors and nurses who 
specialize in the lessening (“palliation’) of symptoms associated with cancer. Palliative care focuses on improving the quality of life for patients with advanced diseases and their family members by [CONTACT_539051], emotional and psychological 
support, and counseling.  
What are my other choices if I do not take part in this study? 
If you decide not to take part in this study, you have other choices. For example: 
• you may choose to have the usual approach to your cancer care  
• you may choose to take part in a different study, if one is available 
• you may choose to discuss palliative care at any time with your doctor in addition to 
having your usual cancer care without participating in this study.  
 
Why is this study being done?  
Patients with advanced cancer often feel stress and worry and have symptoms such as fatigue or 
pain.  The purpose of this study is to see whether patients who receive care from palliative care doctors and nurses at an earlier time in their disease, along with their regular cancer care, will 
experience less emotional and physical issues from their cancer.   
 The effects of the early involvement of the palliative care team will be compared to the usual approach of receivi ng care mostly from the cancer treatment team (as described in the beginning 
of this consent form).   There will be about 400 patients enrolled in this intervention study and there will be about 300 family caregivers enrolled as well.

What are the stud y groups? 
This study has two study groups. Group [ADDRESS_702411] to find out what will happen to you during this study is to read the chart below. Start reading at the left side and read across to the right, following the lines and arrows.   
How long will I be in this study?  
You will be on this study for as long as you receive care for your disease. 
 
What extra tests and procedures will I have if I take part in this study?  
There are no extra exams, tests, or procedures  that you will need to have if you take part in this 
study, with the exception of completing questionnaires.  If you are seeing the palliative care team 
in addition to your usual cancer care, the palliative care team will t ry to have their visits with you 
when you are at the cancer center for your regular cancer care or treatment.  If the palliative care team cannot see you when you attend regular doctor visits for cancer care or treatment, they may schedule their visit with  you on another day. 
 You will be asked to complete a packet of questions when you start the study and in 6, 12 and 24 weeks when you come for your regular cancer care visits.  These questions will ask about some personal information (such as your ethnicity), about how you are feeling (including symptoms like fatigue or sadness), and about what you understand about your diagnosis and planned treatment. The questionnaire should take about 15- [ADDRESS_702412] from taking part in this study?  
If you choose to take part in this study, there is a risk that: 
• You may be asked sensitive or private questions in the study question packet.  If you feel 
uncomfortable about answering any questions, you do not have to answer them.  
 
Let your study doctor know of any questions or concerns you may have about the study question packet. You can ask the study doctor about these questions at any time.  
What possible benefits can I expect from taking part in this study?  
It is not possible to know at this time if the early palliative care in addition to usual cancer care 
approach is better than the usual  cancer care approach so this study may or may not help you. This 
study will help researchers learn things that will help people in the future.

Testing the addition of early palliative care to usual cancer care in patients with incurable 
lung or non- colorectal gastrointestinal cancers  
 
You are being asked to take part in a research study a bout how the treatment of a friend or family 
member who has incurable lung or non- colorectal gastrointestinal cancer  has affected your 
everyday life. You are being asked to participate in this study because your friend or family 
member has agreed to participate in this study to determine whether  having patients get palliative 
care at an earlier time in their disease treatment along with their regular cancer care will improve the emotional and physical issues related to having cancer.   If you are not famili ar with the term “palliative care”, this specialty refers to health care clinicians 
who specialize in the lessening (“palliation’) of disease symptoms. Palliative care focuses on improving the quality of life for patients with advanced diseases and their f amily members by 
[CONTACT_539051], emotional and psychological support, and counseling.  
Participation in this study is purely voluntary. Your decision to participate will not affect your 
friend or family member's ability to receive medical care in any way.  
 
There will be about 400 patients enrolled in this intervention study and about 300 friend or family 
caregivers enrolled. If you should accept our invitation to participate in this study, we would like 
to ask you questions about how your significant other's having cancer has affected you emotionally and physically, as well as your everyday activities, family and social life, and finances. You will be asked to complete questionnaires at four time points – shortly after you sign this consent form, and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. These questions will ask about some personal information, such as, about how you are feeling and about your understanding of your friend or family member’s disease and planned treatment. Completing the questionnaires will take approximately 15 -20 minutes each, 
and will be done at a time during your friend or family member’s regular cancer care visits, at no cost to you. The answers that you give to the interviewer will be confidential, meaning that your answers will not be shared with your significant other or members of his/her medical team. If your 
friend or family member decides not to take part in this study at any time, it will also end your participation in this study. Your participation in this study  will help us better understand how early 
palliative care intervention affects how cancer patients are feeling and whether it improves their quality of life. Please sign below if you agree to complete the questionnaires described in this 
document at the indicated time points. We thank you for your cooperation. 
I have read this consent form or had it read to me. I have discussed it with the study doctor and my 
questions have been answered. I will be given a signed copy of this form. I agree to take part in this study .

end-of-life care. In a comprehensive review of the literature, Greer and colleagues (2013) have 
documented the rationale and evidence base for early palliative care for patients with advanced cancer. 
Given these  positive results, national professional organizations such as the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology, have recommended consideration of referral to palliative care early in the course of disease for patients diagnosed with metastatic cancer.  
The integration of palliative care and standard oncology care in the outpatient setting includes unique features of practice that are distinct from the traditional model of inpatient palliative care. To ascertain the components of early palliative care, we have gath ered data from multiple sources including: 1) 
chart review, 2) focus group interviews with palliative care clinicians, and 3) qualitative analyses of 
audio-recordings of early palliative care consultations for patients diagnosed with metastatic lung or 
advanced non- colorectal gastrointestinal cancers. Based on these data sources, we have outlined the 
following six domains of early palliative care: 
• Developi[INVESTIGATOR_538995]  
• Assessing and treat ing patient symptoms  
• Providing support and reinforcement of copi[INVESTIGATOR_538996]  
• Assessing and enhancing prognostic awareness and illness understanding in patients and 
family caregivers  
• Assisting with treatment deci sion ‐making 
• Planning for end ‐of‐life care 
In the following treatment manual, we detail the essential content and processes of the aforementioned early palliative care domains, in order to facilitate clinician education and dissemination of such 
services. Although the content domains of early palliative care often occur across multiple sessions or several may occur within a single consultation, we will present the information according to the types of palliative care interventions that occur most prominently  during the following time frames: at 
initiation of treatment; throughout the entire course of disease; at clinical turning points (e.g., changing to a new regimen of chemotherapy or after being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]); and upon the 
conclusion of out patient treatment and/or transition to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249].  
Initial Outpatient Palliative Care Visits in the Oncology Setting  
Key Domain: Therapeutic Relationship  
Although developi[INVESTIGATOR_538997], the prominent focus of initial consultations soon after 
diagnosis in the outpatient setting is rapport building and establishing trust. 
• Introducing Palliative Care: The primary focus of the early palliative  care consultation soon after 
Alliance A221303 
38 
NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #[ADDRESS_702415] consultation by [CONTACT_539053]’s and family 
caregiver’s understanding of palliative care, ideally to identify their baseline knowledge 
and familiarity with the service as well as to debunk any myths about the treat ment. 
o To help reduce potential resistance, the PC clinician will then emphasize the role of palliative care to help the patient and family caregivers achieve the best possible quality -
of-life through expert symptom management, support, and assistance with treatment 
decision ‐making. 
o The PC clinician explains the nature of the service as a multidisciplinary team that is available to the patient and family caregiver throughout the disease process. This conversation may also need to differentiate early outpatient palliative care from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677]. 
• Understanding the Patient and Family Caregiver Experience: A key feature of building rapport is learning about the values, life goals, and experiences of patients and their family caregivers both prior to and after the cancer diagnosis. The PC clinician can accomplish this by [CONTACT_539054]:  
o The patient’s life experiences outside the context of disease (including work, family, hobbies/interests, spi[INVESTIGATOR_538998], etc.) 
o Lifestyle chang es that have resulted from the diagnosis and treatment of cancer  
o Patients’ and family caregivers’ current wishes, priorities, and emotions, while providing validation  
• Building Trust with the Patient and Family Caregiver: PC clinicians develop trust and cre dibility 
with patients and family caregivers by [CONTACT_539055]. For example, the following strategies help facilitate trust:  
o Acknowledging the role of the PC clinician in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_538999] “live as well as possible 
for as long as possible.” 
o Clarifying and validating what the patient wishes and does not wish to discuss 
o Encouraging the patient to disclose symptoms and other concerns to the PC clinician 
o Reinforcing the partnership between the patient and family caregiver and PC clinician  
o Reassuring the patient and family caregiver that discussions about end ‐of‐life care or other 
medical decisions will be raised when necessary.  
 
Outpatient Palliative Care Visits throughout the Entire Course of Disease  
Key Domain: Patient Symptoms  
Based on our review of early PC consultations, symptom management is a prominent focus of all 
palliative care visits from initial consultation and throughout the course of disease. Assessing and 
treating symptoms to enhance quality-of- life is one of the primary ways that PC clinicians establish 
trust and credibility with patients and family caregivers. In this way, PC clinicians demonstrate the 
collaborative nature of integrated palliative and oncology care.  
• Preparing for Symptoms: Patients and families often experience concern about the trajectory of 
illness and treatment side effects . PC clinicians in the outpatient setting provide an invaluable 
service by [CONTACT_539056], while offering reassurance 
about the methods for reporting and treating such symptoms as they occur. PC clinicians will 
Alliance A221303 
39 
NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #06  want to explain their role and availability for symptom management both during and between 
clinic visits.  
• Assessing and Treating Symptoms: At every consultation, the PC clinician will conduct a review 
of systems to elicit existing and new symptom concerns, especially as related to disease and 
treatment side effects.  
o The common symptoms patients with incurable cancer will report in the outpatient setting 
include: pain, dyspnea/cough, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, neurologic symptoms, edema, mood/emotional symptoms, sleep ‐related symptoms, issues of sexuality, and other 
symptoms including pre ‐existing or co ‐morbid conditions.  
o Our review of PC consultations for patients with incurable lung or non‐ colorectal GI 
cancers revealed that while symptoms can be quite variable per individual patient, pain and fatigue are frequently reported across all palliative care visits. Also, PC clinicians note that they treat nausea/vomiting more often with transitions in chemotherapy, whereas dyspnea and anxiety symptoms occur more frequently later, such as after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539000]. 
o PC clinicians draw on their expert training and skill in medical management of complex 
symptom clusters with use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], non ‐opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], anti ‐emetic agents, and 
psychotropic agents, etc.  
• Coordinating Symptom Management with Oncology: When working closely with the oncologist, 
the PC clinician will need to maintain ongoing, effective communication with the treatment team to define this mutual collaboration and work within the preferred practice patterns of individual 
oncologists. Specifically, some oncology clinicians may want to take a more or less active role 
in managing symptoms. Thus, PC clinicians provide an extra laye r of support for both the 
oncology team and patient. 
• Providing Referral for Symptom Management: Although PC clinicians possess expertise to 
assess and treat severe and poorly controlled symptoms, they also emphasize the team approach to comprehensive cancer care by [CONTACT_254695], mental health (e.g., psychiatry,   psychology, social work), alternative medicine (e.g., acupuncture, massage, art therapy), and  
spi[INVESTIGATOR_539001]. 
 
Key Domain: Copi[INVESTIGATOR_539002], early PC clinicians address how patients and family 
caregivers are copi[INVESTIGATOR_539003]. The 
provision of early palliative care affords the opportunity and time for counseling patients and family 
caregivers to enhance adjustment and copi[INVESTIGATOR_539004] a result of cancer and its treatment. In particular, the aim is to help patients maintain hope and engagement with life activiti es to the extent that is possible and consistent with their functioning. 
• Reviewing and Validating Prior Copi[INVESTIGATOR_254647]: PC clinicians value and recognize that patients and family caregivers bring their own expertise in copi[INVESTIGATOR_539005].  
o The PC clinician often begins the discussion of copi[INVESTIGATOR_539006] (e.g., use of social support, seeking counseling, increasing self ‐
care activit ies, etc.) they have used to adjust to other life transitions or losses. During this 
conversation, the PC clinician strives to highlight and reinforce all adaptive forms of copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], while also assessing for potentially harmful behaviors (e.g., substance use , social 
withdrawal, etc.).  
o While it is natural in times of crisis to doubt one’s capacity to cope, the PC clinician 
Alliance A221303 
40 
NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #[ADDRESS_702416] the strength and abilities to 
meet their imminent challenges by [CONTACT_539057][INVESTIGATOR_433720]. Moreover, 
by [CONTACT_539058], the PC clinician reinforces that patients and family caregivers are not alone as they navigate the many treatments, scans, 
symptoms, and uncertainties of rel ated to advanced cancer.  
• Discussing and Advocating for Different Methods of Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: After assessing and validating 
prior copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], PC clinicians also introduce various strategies and approaches to help improve adjustment and meaning in life. For example, the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_539007]: 
o Behavioral approaches: Specifically, PC clinicians may employ evidence‐ based techniques 
for stress reduction (e.g., breathing and relaxation exercises); behavioral activation 
(remaining engaged with important activities and sustaining normal life as much as possible 
even with the disease); sleep hygiene; exercise; and activity pacing as needed due to pain, fatigue or other symptoms. 
o Spi[INVESTIGATOR_254649]: PC clinicians assess the role that spi[INVESTIGATOR_539008] a patient’s life 
in a respectful and non ‐judgmental manner and with a broad perspective to incorporate 
multiple meanings of spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824] (such as religious affiliation and participation in 
community of faith, personal spi[INVESTIGATOR_539009], cultural traditions, etc.). 
o Accepting Illness while Maintaining Hope: PC clinicians help patients and family 
caregivers understand that acceptance of illness has cognitive, behavioral, and emotional 
elements. For example, although patients may more or less intellectually understand their prognosis and course of disease, they often experience difficulty in emotionally processing this information. By [CONTACT_14659] a safe venue for patients and family caregivers to ask questions 
about the disease, clarify uncertainties, and experience the related affect, PC c linicians 
facilitate cognitive and emotional acceptance of illness. Also, PC clinicians help patients 
and family caregivers achieve behavioral acceptance by [CONTACT_539059], acknowledging the limitations due to disease, and  maintaining hope for 
achieving valued quality-of- life goals.  
• Social Support: PC clinicians help patients and family caregivers define the different forms of 
social support they need, such as pragmatic versus emotional support. In other words, they clarify  
which individuals help with making meals, transportation to appointments, going shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_276541]., 
as well as those who are available to listen and offer emotional support for discussing the experience of life‐ limiting cancer. Also, the PC clinician works with patients and families to 
identify any gaps and problem ‐solve strategies for soliciting needed support. Conducting Life 
Review: Although not all patients will have the interest or capacity to reflect on their life 
experiences in a meaningful way, some will appreciate the process of life review as a form of 
existential copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Specifically, as patients approach the end ‐of‐life, some seek to take time to   
reflect on their life story and experiences, consider their legacy, and explore how they want to   spend their remaining time. Such life review work might also include specific activities such as  
writing letters to loved ones, completing unfinished tasks, reconciling relationships with family and friends, completing a creative or artistic project (e.g., scrapbook, personal history, quilt, 
woodworking, etc.), as a representation of who the patient is and expression of love for others. 
• Supporting Family Caregiver Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Research shows that patient distress is highly related to 
family caregiver distress and vice versa. In the early palliative care setting, PC clinicians have the rare opportunity to bolster family caregiver copi[INVESTIGATOR_539010], enhancing communication between patients and loved ones, and providing recommendations for additional support or referral. 
• Referring for Additional Support: Again, the PC clinician calls upon other members of the 
Alliance A221303 
41 
NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #06  supportive care team as needed for patients and family caregivers who may be experiencing 
complicated or severe distress. Referral s to social work, psychology, psychiatry, and pastoral 
care may be useful depending on the specific presenting circumstances and concerns.  
 
Outpatient Palliative Care Visits during Clinical Turning Points  
Key Domain: Prognostic Awareness and Illness Understanding 
Based on our review of early PC consultations during clinical turning points, such as starting a new 
chemotherapy regimen or after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], symptom management and copi[INVESTIGATOR_539011]. However, PC clinicians also report with increased frequency discussions about illness understanding and treatment decision-making. Of note, the assessment and discussion of 
prognosis and illness understanding is not a single event but rather occurs over multiple visits, a 
benefit of the longer relationship that early PC clinicians develop in the outpatient setting.  
• Communication with Oncologist: The PC clinician must first consult with the primary oncologist 
to ensure the care team is consistent with their understanding of patient prognosis before engaging in detailed communication with the patient about the likely course of disease. When possible, joint clinic visits between oncology and palliative care will reinforce the team approach 
to care and ensure clear and effective communication with patients and family caregivers.  
• Assessing and Informing Patient Expectations of Prognosis and Illness Process: We require 
reading the article by [CONTACT_161219]. (2013), which provides a detailed account of how to cultivate prognostic awarene ss and deliver information about the disease process of advanced cancer in 
the early palliative care setting. By [CONTACT_539060], PC clinicians recognize that patient and family caregiver illness understanding often vacillates between more and less realisti c 
expectations over time, or even within the same clinic visit, which can be confusing for clinicians. The following strategies help improve prognostic awareness in a manner that is consistent with the degree of cognitive ‐emotional copi[INVESTIGATOR_539012].  
o Assessment of prognostic awareness begins with asking patients and family caregivers in an open‐ ended manner about their understanding of the disease and their future. The 
responses from patients provide some clarity about the level of awareness and also their 
ability to tolerate discussions regarding prognosis. For patients who struggle to have these conversations, framing questions with the hypothetical of “imagining a poorer he alth state” 
may be useful.  
o Communication strategies for delivering prognostic information include the “Ask ‐Tell ‐
Ask” and “Pairing Hope with Worry” techniques (for further details, see Jackson et al., 
2013). PC clinicians understand that they must clarify the type of information patients and family caregivers want to know, such as questions about expected lengt h of life versus 
concerns about how the disease changes over time and what the dying process is like.  
o As patients and family caregivers begin to understand and integrate information about prognosis, they will often experience heightened affect such as disb elief, sadness, anger, 
etc. Rather than blocking or providing false reassurance, the PC clinician’s role is to witness 
and validate these emotions with silence, an empathic touch, re‐ statement of realistic hopes, 
and “I wish” statements (e.g., “It sounds like that was hard to hear. I wish I had better 
news.”) 
o The PC clinician can then pi[INVESTIGATOR_539013], emphasizing real istic hopes and quality -of-life goals (e.g., helpi[INVESTIGATOR_539014]).  
• Conducting Separate Conversations with Family Caregivers about Illness Understanding: The 
Alliance A221303 
42 
NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #06  vacillation in patients’ prognostic aware ness over time is not only challenging for clinicians but 
can also be   difficult for family caregivers. Ideally, conversations about prognosis and illness 
understanding occur with both patients and family caregivers present, though this may not always be possible or clinically appropriate. In such circumstances, the PC clinician obtains 
consent from the patient to discuss illness concerns separately with identified family caregivers. 
Such conversations can help family caregivers understand the process of i llness understanding, 
including the normal pattern of vacillation between more and less accurate prognostic awareness, offering strategies for communication and support. 
 
Key Domain: Treatment Decision -making 
As noted earlier, although discussion of treatment decision-making can occur at any point along the illness trajectory for patients with advanced cancer, early PC clinicians report more frequent discussions of this topic during times of clinical transitions, such as when starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_539015]. 
• Assessing Patient Values in Treatment Decision ‐making: In the shared decision ‐making process 
about cancer care, the early PC clinician elicits information from patients and family caregivers 
regarding their decision‐ making style, quality versus quantity of life concerns, and life goals. 
The aim of thi s assessment is to determine the extent to which patient’s preferences and values 
align with current or potential treatments.  
• Discussing Treatment Considerations: Given their medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_18700], early PC clinicians provide 
an extra layer of support for patients and family caregivers to understand the efficacy, risks and benefits, side effects, and potential burdens associated with different forms of cancer treatment. 
Furthermore, these conversations provide an opportunity to reinforce the role of palliative care 
for mitigating symptoms and toxicities.  
• Supporting Treatment Decisions: PC clinicians value and reinforce patient autonomy in making 
informed treatment decisions. At multiple points during the course of cancer care, patients must discern whether to st art, continue, or stop treatments in collaboration with their cancer care team, 
as well as decide the extent to which family caregivers are consulted about these decisions. In 
this context, early PC clinicians help clarify any misunderstanding about treatm ent, support 
patient decision ‐making and freedom to change course, as well as facilitate communication with 
family caregivers and members of the oncology team.  
 
Final Outpatient Palliative Care Visits and Transition to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539016]: End-of-L ife Care 
Based on our review of early PC consultations, PC clinicians generally raise the discussion of end -of-
life (EOL) care incrementally over time and most prominently later in the course of illness, after having 
established a strong, trusting therapeutic relationship with patients and family caregivers. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the final palliative care visits in the outpatient setting focus not only on symptom management, illness understanding, and decisions about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_539017]. 
• Discussing End‐ of‐Life Care Options: Given the longer length of the clinical relationship with 
early palliative care, PC clinicians have the advantage to reduce patient anxiety in discussing EOL care concerns by [CONTACT_539061] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_539018]. The primary topi[INVESTIGATOR_539019]: selection of healthcare proxy, determination of resuscitation preferences, will/estate planning, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677], location of death, and funeral planning. 
• Supporting Family caregivers in EOL Care Coordination and Bereavement: Most patients with 
advanced cancer will experience progressive decline in their functional status over time. Thus, 
Alliance A221303 
43 
NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #06  they often require additional assistance from family and loved ones for personal care and 
communication of their values and wishes as they approach the end-of- life. This caregiving role 
can be both personally meaningful and stressful for family members and loved ones. 
o The PC clinician works closely with patients and family caregivers to determine the 
available resources for EOL care and whether it is appropriate for patients to receive their 
terminal care in the home or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539020]. PC clinicians can also serve as advocates for family caregivers in making plans for the will/estate and funeral.  
o Early PC clinicians recognize that their specialized care considers the family unit as the focus of treatment. As such, they continue to provide resources, support, counseling, and referral for bereavement in family careg ivers after the patient has died.  
 Conclusion  
Our intent in developi[INVESTIGATOR_539021]. While the manual offers an organizational framework and highlights the essential components and processes of early palliative 
care, we recognize the value of the PC clinicians’ clinical judgment in discerning the appropriate timing 
and exact tailoring of these interventions for de livery in a patient- centered manner.

NCI Version Date: 07/15/2016 Update #06  APPENDIX  V: PATIENT RECRUITMENT  
 
Suggested Language for Clinicians Offering the Study to Eligible Patients/Families  
 
I’d like to talk to you about a different kind of study.  Most studies or clinical trials focus on treatments for 
your x cancer.  However, the goal of this study is to figure out the best way to support you and your family as you face your cancer diagnosis.  Patients with x cancer often have symptoms which are difficult to 
manage, such as pain and fatigue, and both the patient and their family members often feel distressed or 
worried about their diagnosis.  The goal of this study is to figure out the best way to help patients and 
families with these important aspects of their care. 
 
The study is looking at adding an additional team – called the palliative care team  – on top of your regular 
cancer care team to see if having them involved earlier is helpful f or you and your family.  Participating in 
this study will not interfere with or impact your cancer treatment in any way.  
 
Palliative care clinicians assist patients with their symptoms and help patients and families cope with their 
cancer and make decision s about their care.  Traditionally, these doctors and nurses only meet people when 
they are very ill or in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The goal of this study is to see if having the palliative care team care 
for you earlier in your illness will be helpful for you and y our family .   
 
This is a randomized study – so ½ of the people will be “coin flipped” to regular or usual care where we 
would only ask this team to see you if we felt like we needed their help and ½ will have this team follow 
you along with me and pi[INVESTIGATOR_539027].  
 
This study is very little work for you .  If you are “coin flipped” to see the palliative care team early, we will 
ask them to see you on the same day as me or during your chemotherapy treatments so you won’t need to 
make extra visits.   
 
Whether you see the team early or not – we will ask you to complete about 30 minutes of questionnaires 
four times over the course of your illness; today and in 6, 12, and 24 weeks – so again, not a lot of work for 
you.  Remember the g oal of this study is to see which care model is most helpful for patients and their 
families so these questions measure things like your symptoms, mood, and how you are copi[INVESTIGATOR_539028].  
 
Important Reminders When Discussin g the Study:  
1. Palliative care is NOT hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209920] -of-life care. The goal of palliative care is to help patients live as 
well as they can for as long as they can.   
2. The palliative care team will not “force” people to talk about death and dying or other topi[INVESTIGATOR_539029].   
3. Patients’ cancer treatment or treatment clinical trials will NOT be impacted by [CONTACT_539066]. 
4. Patients without willing family members are still able to participate.

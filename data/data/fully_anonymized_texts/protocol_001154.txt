devices are noninvasive and data will be collected from healthy  volunteers.  
 This is a nonrandomized single arm study where all of the subje cts are enrolled into the experimental arm and 
receive the MightySat device on their index finger along with a  RAM sensor on their neck, a pulse oximeter 
on their other index finger, and a nasal cannula which will be attached to the capnography device.

Adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a subjects, users or other persons, whether or not 
related to the medical device under study. 
Device-related adverse event:  Adverse event related to, associ ated with, or caused by, the use of a medical 
device under study, including but not limited to events that ma y have been attributed to the device because of 
device failure or malfunction, improper or inadequate design, m anufacture or user error.

safety or performance.  Device deficiencies include malfunction s, use errors and inadequate labeling. 
Serious adverse event:  Adverse event that: a) led to death, b)  led to serious deterioration in the health of the 
subject, that resulted in: (i) a life-threatening illness or in jury,  (ii) a persistent or significant impairment of a 
body structure or a body function, (iii) in-patient or prolonge d hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or (iv) medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or p ermanent impairment to a body structure or a 
body function, or c) led to fetal distress, fetal death or a co ngenital abnormality or birth defect.  NOTE:  
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition, or a proc edure required by [CONTACT_75693], without serious deterioration in health, is not considere d a serious adverse event. 
D.1 Adverse Events   
All devices used in the study are non-significant risk devices.  All study procedures are

documented as described below.  
All adverse events that occur during the study shall be recorde d on the Case Report Form. The 
Adverse Event Form (FRM-3280) shall also be completed.  
Skin irritation/redness from the adhesive is an anticipated adv erse event.  
D.2 Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Events 
The investigator shall promptly report to the IRB within 24 hou rs any serious and unanticipated 
adverse event involving subjects.  
At the time of discharge from the study, an unresolved serious and unanticipated adverse event(s) 
will be followed up by [CONTACT_744688](s) are resolved, stabilized, or the patient is 
unable to follow-up or the adverse event is otherwise explained . The investigator will also instruct

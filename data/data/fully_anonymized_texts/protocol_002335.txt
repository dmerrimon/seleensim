Name [CONTACT_790]/Company:  
Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Name [CONTACT_791]:  
AG-348 
Title of Study:  
An Open -Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of AG -348 in Regularly Transfused Adult 
Subjects With Pyruvate Kinase (PK)  Deficiency  
Study Center(s):  
This is a multicenter study that will be conducted in multiple countries.  
Phase of Development: 3 
Objectives:  
Primary:  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with AG -348, as 
assessed by [CONTACT_171022]. 
Secondary:  The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of treatment with AG -348. 
Exploratory: 
• To determine the effect of AG -348 on markers of hemolysis, erythropoietic activity, and other 
indicators of clinical activity  
• To determine the effect of AG -348 on markers of iron metabolism and indicators of iron 
overload 
• To determine the effect of AG -348 on health- related quality of life (HRQoL), as determined 
using patient-reported outcomes 
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AG -348 after oral administration 
• To evaluate the relationship of AG- 348 pharmacokinetics to indicators of clinical activity  
• To eval uate the change in the levels of red blood cell (RBC) -specific form of pyruvate kinase 
(PKR) protein in whole blood 
Methodology: 
Study AG348-C-007 is a 2- part, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study consisting of a Dose 
Optimization Period (Part 1) follow ed by a Fixed -Dose Period (Part 2). This study will evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of treatment with AG -348 in a minimum of 20, with up to 40, adult subjects with 
pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) who are regularly receiving blood transfusions.  
Prior to Part [ADDRESS_200127]’s complete 
transfusion history from 52 weeks prior to signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF)  will be collected 
and recorded on the source documentation and electronic case report form (eCRF ).  
The transfusion history information will be used as follows: 
• To determine whether the subject meets the study criteria for regular transfusion frequency  
• To calculate the Mean Transfusion Frequency (MTF)  
• To calculate th e Individual Transfusion Trigger (TT), which is the mean (±0.5 g/dL or 
±0.31 mmol/L) of a subject’s collected historical pretransfusion hemoglobin ( Hb) 
concentrations. For each transfusion, only the Hb concentration within [ADDRESS_200128] to a transfusion will b e included in this calculation.  
Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 5 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  • To calculate the Mean Number of Blood Units (MNU) transfused per transfusion  
• To function as historical control data to be used in the analysis 
All subjects will receive AG -348 in Parts 1 and 2 of the study. During Part 1 of the study, all subjects 
will start on a dose of 5 mg AG -348 administered twice daily (BID). Over the course of Part 1, each 
subject will undergo intrasubject dose optimization. Each subject’s dose level of AG -348 may be 
increased 2 times beyond the starting dose of 5 mg BID (ie, from 5 to 20 mg BID and from 20 to 
50 mg BID). In the Fixed- Dose Period of the study (Part 2), a subject will receive AG -348 at his/her 
optimized dose with no planned adjustments (ie, as a fixed dose) for a fixed period of 24 weeks. 
All subjects who remain on study during Part 2 through the Week 24 Visit may be eligible for an 
open-label extension study with AG-348. Subjects who continue on into an extension study will not be required to attend the Follow- up Visit. Subjects who continue the study through the Part 2 Week 24 
Visit on study drug but do not continue on into an extension study will attend the Follow -up Visit 
28±[ADDRESS_200129] dose of study drug. Subjects who discontinue the study prior to the Part 2 
Week  24 Visit should attend the End of Study Visit 28±[ADDRESS_200130] 
attended or 28±[ADDRESS_200131] dose of study drug, whichever is later.  
All subjects who discontinue study drug at any time during the study should undergo a dose taper as 
described in this protocol, unless an emergency situation justifies discontinuing the study drug abruptly. Whether the dose taper is performed or not, subjects discontinuing AG-348 should be 
monitored for signs of hemolysis and worsening of anemia.

the Fixed-Dose Period (Part 2). In Part 2 of the study, subjects will receive their optimized dose of 
AG-348 for 24 weeks. 
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
Not applicable.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Study Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of subjects who achieve a reduction in transfusion 
burden, defined as a ≥33% reduction in the number of RBC units transfused during the 24 weeks of 
Part 2 compared with the historical transfusion burden standardized to 24 weeks (Standardized Control 
Period).  
Secondary Endpoints:  
The secondary endpoints of the study are the following: 
• Annualized total number of RBC units transfused during the study (both Part 1 and Part 2) 
compared with the historical transfusion burden 
• Number of transfusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_170992] 2 compared with the Standardized Control Period 
• Proportion of subjects who become transfusion-free, defined as 0 transfusions administered during Part 2 
• Proportion of subjects who achieve Hb concentrations in the normal range at least once, 8 weeks or more after a transfusion in Part 2 
• Safety endpoints, including the type, incidence, severity, and relationship to treatment of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) , and  AEs leading to treatment dose 
reduction, treatment interruption, and treatment discontinuation 
• Laboratory tests over time (eg, serum chemistry, liver function tests [LFTs] , hematology, 
coagulation, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], sex steroids, urinalysis), physical examination findings, dual- energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) scans (hip and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), vital signs , and 12- lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG) data  
Exploratory Endpoints:  
The exploratory endpoints of the study are the following: 
• Change from ba seline in the following markers of hemolysis: bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) , and haptoglobin levels 
• Change from baseline in markers of erythropoietic activity  
• Change from baseline in markers of iron metabolism and indicators of iron overload  
• Change from baseline over time in HRQoL scores (ie, Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Impact Assessment  [PKDIA] , Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Diary  [PKDD] , EuroQol -5D-5L 
[EQ-5D-5L]) 
Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 10 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  • Characterization of pharmacokinetic profile (drug concentrations over time) and det ermination 
of pharmacokinetic parameters of AG -348 (eg, area under the plasma concentration × time 
curve  [AUC] , maximum [peak ] concentration [C max], and others as applicable) in Part 2  
• Exposure-response (or pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic) relationship bet ween relevant 
pharmacokinetic parameters and endpoints that are indicators of clinical activity  
• Changes in total PKR protein levels  
Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size:   
Due to the rarity of the disease and the small patient population, the sample size is largely driven by 
[CONTACT_5870]. Given the feasibility results and uncertainty of the screen failure rate, the study will enroll a 
minimum of 20, with up to 40, subjects. With a sample size of 20, the power of the study is limited, 
that is, the power will be 58% to detect a response rate of 30% compared to a null rate of 10% with an 
exact test at 2 -sided 0.05 significance level. There will be 75% power to detect a large resp onse rate of 
35%, compared to the null of 10% . When the sample size is 40, the power will be at least 90%, even if 
the target response rate is 30%.  
Analysis Sets:   
Two analysis sets will be defined for evaluation of the study endpoints:  
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. The FAS will be used for primary efficacy analyses and safety analyses, unless specified otherwise.  
• The Per Protocol Set (PPS) is defined as a subset of the FAS including subjects who have completed Part 2. The PPS will be used for sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint. 
Statistical Methods:  
Statistical analysis details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be 
finalized before the database l ock. 
Subject disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant medications, study drug exposure, study drug compliance, and other background characteristics will be summarized. All summaries will be based on the FAS unless otherw ise specified in the SAP.  
Efficacy Analysis 
For the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, the number and proportion of subjects who achieve a 
transfusion reduction response, defined as ≥33% reduction in the number of RBC units transfused 
during the 24 weeks in Part 2 compared to the historical transfusion burden standardized to 24 weeks (Standardized Control Period), along with its 95% CI based on the exact binomial distribution, will be 
provided based on the FAS. Subjects who discontinue the study before completing [ADDRESS_200149] of early 
discontinuation on the efficacy results.  
For the analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints of annualized total number of RBC units transfused during the study and number of transfusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_170993] 2, their change and 
percentage change from the corresponding normalized historical transfusion burden will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Additional analyses include:  
1. Number and percentage of subjects who are transfusion- free in the Fixed -Dose Period (Part 2), 
along with its 95% CI based on the exact binomial distribution, will be provided.  
Study AG348-C-[ADDRESS_200150] 
once, 8 weeks or more after a transfusion in Part 2, along with its 95% CI based on the exact 
binomial distribution, will be provided.  
Additional sensitivity analysis, supportive analysis, and analyses for exploratory endpoints and possibly additional endpoints w ill be described in the SAP.  
The overall safety profile of study drug will be assessed based on summary of treatment- emergent AEs, 
clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, physical examination findings, and DXA scans, based on the FAS. Only descripti ve analysis will be performed (ie, no formal testing will be performed). 
Interim Analysis and Independent Data Monitoring Committee:  
No interim analysis is planned, but interim analyses may take place at any time during the study , if 
warranted , by [CONTACT_171027]/or deemed necessary by [CONTACT_171028]. No independent 
data monitoring committee is planned for this study.

5.1. Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) is a glycolytic enzymopathy that results in life -long, 
nonspherocytic hemolytic a nemia. It is an autosomal recessive disease with a variable clinical 
presentation, ranging from mild to life  threatening, which can be associated with severe, 
debilitating comorbidities.  
5.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_170995]; however, the current estimated diagnosed 
prevalence of patients with PK deficiency in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and European Union 5 
(EU5) (ie, [LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Italy, Spain,  and the [LOCATION_008]) is approximately 2,400 cases 
(Carey et al, 2000; de Medicis et al, 1992) . As with many rare genetic diseases, true prevalence 
of PK deficiency is not well understood ( Beutler and Gelbart, 2000) . Most recent estimates have 
been cited at approximately 1:20,000 to 1:485,000 ( Beutler and Gelbart, 2000; Carey et al, 2 000; 
Hirono et al, 2014; Zanella et al, 2007 ).  
5.1.2. Biochemistry and Genetics  
In normal cells, pyruvate kinase enzymatically catalyzes the metabolic conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into pyruvate and adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) as the final step in glycolysis. It is believed that PK deficiency leads to insufficient ATP production, resulting in red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis due to an impaired 
ability to maintain cellular membrane homeostasis (van Wijk and van Solinge, 2005 ). Indeed, 
PK deficiency has been reported to be associated with reduced RBC survival, as well as with 
impaired RBC maturation (Aizawa et al, 2003 ). 
Pyruvate kinase deficiency is the second most common of the glycolytic enzymopathies after 
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Red blood cells from patients with PK deficiency are characterized by [CONTACT_171029], 
including a deficiency in ATP levels. Levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3 -DPG), PEP, and 
other glycolytic intermediates upstream of the reaction catalyzed by [CONTACT_171030] -specific form of 
pyruvate kinase (PKR) have been reported to be elevated in patients with PK deficiency, 
reflecting the inhibition of glycolysis at the PKR step (Oski and Bowman, 1969) (see Figure  1). 
Red blood cells from patients with PK deficiency show less efficient utilization of glucose than 
the RBCs of healthy individuals ( Tanaka et al, 1962 ).

PEP = phosphoenolpyruvate; PKR = red blood cell -specifi c form of pyruvate kinase.  
Note: Not all steps in glycolysis are shown.  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease (patients must have 2 mutated 
alleles, usually as compound heterozygotes), and most patients with PK deficiency present with unique combinations of poorly characterized or private mutations. In addition to genetic 
heterogeneity, PK deficiency exhibits considerable phenotypic variability. For example, the US 
Pennsylvanian Amish community represents a subgroup of PK deficient patients with a relatively homogeneous genetic background (eg, homozygous R479H mutation, restricted marriage pool) 
and uniform lifestyle. Yet, despi[INVESTIGATOR_170996], there is still considerable phenotypic 
variation within this community in terms of disease severity (Grace et al, 2015 ). 
A nondrug study protocol to obtain critical information regarding the natural history of 
PK deficiency and the range and incidence of related symptoms, treatments, and complications—
known as the PK Deficiency Natural History St udy (NHS) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017)—has been 
developed by [CONTACT_171031]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ([LOCATION_011], [LOCATION_005], US) and is funded and supported by [CONTACT_171032]. This multicenter, global NHS is designed as a longitudinal cohort study with 
retrospective, baseline, and annual collection of data over a 2- year period. The study has thus far 
identified 123 mutations in 255 subjects ( Bianchi et al, 2017). Fifty mutations or approximately 
40% of the identified mutations had not been previously described and were identified only as a 
consequence of the systematic genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_170997]. This highlights the evolving understanding of the genetic basis of PK deficiency. 
An at tempt has been made to impose a system of classification onto this large collection of 
potential genotypes by [CONTACT_171033] 2 classifications and 3 groups ( Bianchi et al, 
2015). This classification showed that 79 of the 123 mutations (64.2%) were missense mutations, 
which are single nucleotide changes that result in amino acid substitutions in the PK R enzyme. 
The effects of these missense mutations can include a loss of catalytic efficiency and/or a loss of 
protein stability of the enzyme. Non- missense mutations include those that cause premature 
truncations of the enzyme, deletions or frameshifts, or mutations that affect splicing of the enzyme. Many of these non -missense mutations are predicted to be null alleles of PKR, resulting 
in a lack of functional protein expression ( Bianchi et al, 2017). 
5.1.3. Clinical Characteristics  
The natural history of untreated PK deficiency is characterized by [CONTACT_81428]- long hemolytic anemia 
and subsequent associated comorbidities, which can include a need for transfusions, susceptibility to infections after splenectomy, worsening anemia during pregnancy, and 
symptoms associated with chronic hemolytic anemia (Rider et al, 2011) . Some patients with 
PK deficiency may present with severe hemolytic anemia in early infancy that requires 
immediate care. Unconjugated bilirubin is also often chronically elevated in patients with 

Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 24 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  PK deficiency; thus, pi[INVESTIGATOR_170998]. Additionally, iron overload is progressive and can ultimately lead to life- threatening 
symptoms.  
There are no generally agreed -upon definitions of “mild”, “moderate”, and “severe” disease 
because mu ltiple factors —such as the degree of anemia, the level of bilirubin and severity of 
jaundice, and complications (including iron overload, transfusion need, and subjective feelings of 
fatigue and low energy level) —must be taken into account before an evaluation can be made.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Transfusion Frequency  
There are no guidelines for transfusion management in patients with PK deficiency. Most adults 
with the disease have undergone splenectomy and require only sporadic or ad hoc transfusions, 
which are usually administ ered in the context of an acute hemolytic epi[INVESTIGATOR_170999], trauma, or stress ( Grace et al, 2018 ; Grace et al, 2016 ; Zanella et al, 2007 ; Zanella et 
al, 2005) . These patients are considered “no t regularly transfused.” 
A minority of adult patients with PK deficiency still require regular transfusions after splenectomy. Some adult patients who have not undergone splenectomy also require regular 
transfusions. There is no clear definition of what constitutes a regularly transfused patient with 
PK deficiency; data from the PK Deficiency NHS point to a wide range of transfusion frequencies in adults with the disease. For patients transfused infrequently, it can be difficult to 
determine retrospectively  whether a patient is transfused mainly for cause or requires infrequent, 
but still regular transfusions. Experts have indicated patients receiving fewer than 6 transfusions 
per year (every 2 months on average over a 1-year period) are unlikely to require the transfusions 
to maintain hemoglob in (Hb) at an acceptable level.  
Analysis of the NHS study, which has data for a total of 255 subjects  as of 28 April 2017, 
identified a maximum of 16 adult subjects  (out of 98 non- Amish subjects ) who reported 
receiving at least 6 transfusions in the year prior to enrollment ( Grace et al, 2018 ). This severely 
limits the type of clinical trials that could be performed in this population.  
5.2. Investigational Product (AG -348)  
5.2.1. Proposed Mech anism of Action of AG-[ADDRESS_200162]-spectrum activator of PKR, 1 of 4 pyruvate kinase isoenzymes expressed in human tissues from 2 separate genes. Both PKR and the liver- specific form of 
pyruvate kinase (PKL) are splice isoforms of the PKLR  gene, while pyruvate kinase muscle 
isozyme (PKM)[ADDRESS_200163] is disrupted in patients with  
PK deficiency. This disruption results in significantly reduced RBC lifespan and manifests 
clinically as nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. In patients with PK deficiency, RBCs and their progenitors are characterized by [CONTACT_171034], 
including a buildup of PEP and the intermediate 2,3-DPG, and lowered levels of ATP. It is hypothesized that AG-348 restores the ability of RBCs to convert PEP + ADP to pyruvate + ATP and thereby [CONTACT_171035].  

Study AG348-C-[ADDRESS_200164]  
A series of exploratory pharmacology studies were conducted to characterize the ability of 
AG-348 to activate wild -type (WT) PKR and anemia-associated PKR mutants in vitro, ex vivo, 
and in vivo. 
Biochemical studies showed that AG-[ADDRESS_200165] markers was evaluated in both human 
and murine RBCs and whole blood. AG-348 dose-response curves in human and murine RBCs showed increased PKR activity. AG-348 dose-response curves also showed increased ATP 
levels.  
The effects of AG -348 on PKR activity and RBC metabolism were also assessed in blood 
samples from subjects with PK deficiency. AG-348 activated PKR and induced metabolic changes (increased ATP levels and decreased 2,3 -DPG levels) consistent with increased 
glycolytic pathway activity in RBCs from PK -deficient patients with different mutations in the 
PKR enzyme. Finally, a series of 3 in vivo pharmacology studies conducted in C57BL/6 mice confirmed the in vitro potency of AG-348 in increasing WT PKR enzyme activity and in 
modulating the levels of the downstream markers, ATP, and 2,3-DPG. Based on the data from these studies, a strong pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship was established 
between AG -348 area under the plasma concentration × time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC
0-12) 
and ATP/2,3- DPG AUC 0-[ADDRESS_200166]/inverse agonist 
and an aromatase inhibitor. Findings consistent with aromatase inhibition have been observed in the reproductive organs of male and female rats in toxicology studies of up to 6 months’ duration 
at exposures as low as 10,900 ng•hr/mL. No findings consistent with aromatase inhibition have 
been observed in monkeys in toxicology studies of up to 9 months’ duration. Effects consistent with aromatase inhibition and antagonism/inverse agonism at the H3 receptor have been 
observed in clinical studies (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Emesis was observed in monkey toxicology studies, and dose-dependent emesis was observed in 
a dedicated safety pharmacology study in ferrets. Based on animal studies, AG-[ADDRESS_200167] the ability to maintain pregnancy. 
Further details on these and other nonclinical studies, including nonclinical pharmacokinetics, 
are in the AG -348 Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
5.2.3. Summary of AG-348 Clinical Data 
AG-348 has been evaluated in 4 clinical pharmacology studies in healthy subjects (3 completed 
and 1 ongoing) and 1 ongoing Phase 2, open- label, efficacy, and safety study (A G348-C-003, 
referred to as DRIVE -PK) in adult subjects with PK deficiency.  
The ongoing DRIVE-PK study is an open-label study intended for adult subjects with PK deficiency who are considered transfusion independent (per protocol definition) with 
screening Hb concentration ≤12 g/dL or ≤11 g/dL for males and females, respectively. The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential indicators of clinical activity of 

Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 26 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  2 dose levels of AG-348 (50 and 300 mg twice daily [BID]) administered for up to [ADDRESS_200168]- PK study is also 
intended to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AG-348, the PD response (ATP and 2,3- DPG 
levels) after administration of AG -348, and additional PD biomarkers. 
A brief overview of AG-348 pharmacokinetic and PD data is provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively. An overview of the available safety  data from these studies as well 
as preliminary efficacy results from the DRIVE -PK study is included in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
Please refer to the AG -348 IB for additional details on all clinical studies and results.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of AG- 348 Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetic profile of AG-348 has been wel l characterized in the Phase 1 
single -ascending dose (SAD) study (AG348-C-001) and Phase 1 multiple- ascending dose 
(MAD) study (AG348 -C-002), conducted in healthy adult subjects. The pharmacokinetics of 
AG-348 increased in a dose-proportional manner across tested doses in the SAD study and at lower doses in the MAD study. At higher dose levels in the MAD study, a less than 
dose-proportional increase was observed, attributed to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 
induction effect of AG- 348. The effective half -life of AG -[ADDRESS_200169] -PK, and will also be used in this study. Prior to introducing the tablet formulation in 
clinical studies, a relative bioavailability study (AG348 -C-005) was conducted in healthy 
subjects to compare the pharmacokinetics of the 2 formulations (ie, capsules and tablets). Systemic exposure to AG -348 appeared similar between formulations with an area under the 
plasma concentration × time curve (AUC) ratio of 1.05 and a maximum (peak) concentration (C
max) ratio of 1.[ADDRESS_200170] been evaluated. To date, 
pharmacokinetic data of AG -348 in adult subjects with PK deficiency were found to be similar to 
that observed in healthy adult subjects. 
Please refer to the AG -348 IB for detailed information regarding the pharmacokinetics of 
AG-348.

of decrease in concentration of 2,3-DPG or increase in ATP has been observed. The reason for 
this is not completely clear.  
Please refer to the AG -348 IB for detailed information regarding the PD properties of AG-348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of AG-348 Clinical Safety Data 
Overall, AG -348 has been generally well tolerated among healthy adult subjects and adult 
subjects with PK deficiency. Important identified risks associated with administration of AG -348 
in clinical studies include bone mineral density (BMD) decrease (including osteoporosis and 
osteopenia due to aromatase inhibition), withdrawal hemolysis, and insomnia (not clinically 
serious, ie, not Grade 3 or Grade 4).  
Potential ris ks of AG-[ADDRESS_200172] (AESIs) for AG -348. Please ref er to 
Section  11.2.6 for additional information on AESIs and the current AG- 348 IB for a more 
detailed overview of available safety data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of AG -[ADDRESS_200173]- PK study in adult subjects with PK deficiency, the efficacy of 
AG-348 is primarily analyzed via evaluation of changes in Hb concentrations.  
As of a data cutoff of 14 July 2017, a preliminary analysis indicates that of the 52 subjects who 
received AG -348 during the Core Period, 26 subjects (50.0%) achieved maximum increases in 
Hb >1 g/dL ( Grace et al, 2017 ). Of the 42 subjects with ≥1 missense mutation, 25 subjects 
(59.5%) had an Hb increase >1.0 g/dL. The majority of Hb increases were rapid and sustained. The median time to the first observation of an Hb increase >1 g/dL above baseline was 10 days 
(range , 7 to 187 days). 
Overall, treatment with AG -[ADDRESS_200174] -PK study, combined with the data 
from the 2  completed Phase 1 SAD and MAD studies, support continued clinical development of 
AG-348 for the treatment of patients with PK deficiency. In order to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of AG -348 across the disease spectrum of PK deficiency, 2 studies investigating the 
treatment of AG -348 in subjects with PK deficiency will be conducted. This protocol, 
AG348 -C-007, will be conducted in adult subjects with PK deficiency who are regularly 
receiving transfusions, while a separate study, AG348-C-006, will be conducted in adult subjects 
with PK deficiency who are not regularly receiving transfusions.  

Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 28 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  A clear and serious unmet medical need exists for patients with PK deficiency. At present, there 
are no approved, disease- specific therapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with 
PK deficiency; rather, available treatment options are supportive only. Many adult patients 
underwent splenectomy in childhood as a means to reduce hemolysis and eliminate the need for regular transfusions. However, some patients, despi[INVESTIGATOR_171000], still require 
regular transfusions to maintain their Hb concentration at a level considered acceptabl e. Iron 
overload, an unavoidable complication of chronic hemolytic anemia, which is usually 
incompletely controlled by [CONTACT_171036], is made worse by [CONTACT_171037]. The consequences of transfusion-related iron overload if inadequately treated 
include liver dysfunction, cardiomyopathy (which may be fatal), and endocrinopathy, including diabetes, hypogonadism, and infertility. All this contributes to a clear unmet medical need for the 
regularly  transfused population of patients with PK deficiency.  
Treatment with AG -[ADDRESS_200175] activity in RBCs to reduce hemolysis and provide clinical benefit to subjects with PK deficiency. This clinical study will determine 
whether AG -348 provides benefit to the regularly transfused patient population by [CONTACT_171038]. 
5.3.1. Justification of Study Design 
Given the rarity of patients with PK deficiency in  general and the extreme rarity of regularly 
transfused patients with PK deficiency (less than 20% of the non-Amish adult population with 
PK deficiency according to the NHS), it is not possible to conduct an adequately powered 
randomized controlled study. Therefore, Study AG348-C-[ADDRESS_200176]’s own historical transfusion data will be used as their individual control. Efficacy 
will be measured by [CONTACT_171039]-[ADDRESS_200177]’s historical transfusion burden. Subjects 
will be treated on study for up to [ADDRESS_200178] a 
reasonable estimate of the transfusion frequency on a stable dose of AG -348 in subjects whose 
historical transfusion frequency could range from every 3 weeks to every 8 weeks. Additional details on the study design are provided in Section  7.1. See Section  [IP_ADDRESS], Section  [IP_ADDRESS], and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for further justification regarding specific aspects of the study design.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Justification Related to Sample Size 
As previously mentioned (Section 5.3.1) , it is estimated that less than 20% of the non -Amish 
adult population with PK deficiency is regularly transfused. A feasibility assessment and 
outreach effort to evaluate the accessibility  of a subject population meeting the criteria for this 
proposed Phase [ADDRESS_200179] thus far identified 36 potential subjects in 22 sites within 
13 countries. Although there is uncertainty with  the screen failure rate, a number of these 
patients may be ineligible for the trial, for a variety of reasons.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Justification of Using Individual Transfusion History Data as Comparator to 
Assess Efficacy of AG -[ADDRESS_200180]’s own historical transfusion data will be used as his/her individual control to assess efficacy (ie, reduction in transfusion need while the subject is receiving AG-348). Using 

Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 29 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  historical controls rather than a placebo control group is an established method in rare diseases 
(Moscicki  and Tandon, 2017). More specifically, individual patients’ transfusion histories have 
been used as a comparator in multiple studies conducted in frequently transfused patients with various chronic anemias (eg, beta -thalassemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hem oglobinuria). It is 
especially valuable in heterogeneous patient populations, such as regularly transfused patients with PK deficiency where the absence of transfusion guidelines translates to patients with apparently similar degrees of anemia potentially being treated differently.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Justification of Duration for Collection of Historical Data and Duration on Optimized Dose  
This study includes a collection of [ADDRESS_200181]’s  basal transfusion 
need.   
The subjects enrolled into this study will have a transfusion frequency at a minimum of around every  [ADDRESS_200182] -PK study conducted in subjects who 
do not require regular transfusions. Briefly, a sequential population pharmacokinetic- efficacy 
model was devel oped using increase in Hb as the efficacy endpoint, while a binary logistic 
regression approach incorporating the safety endpoints of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total and free testosterone, estrone, estradiol, insomnia, and 
hot flush was used for the analysis of exposure-safety relationship. Insomnia was the only safety 
event that was found to be significant in the logistic regression analysis.  
Following model development, simulations were conducted to select 3 dose levels for evaluation 
in Phase 3 studies:  
1. The low dose level (5 mg BID) was identified as a dose at which patients were likely to 
have an Hb increase of ≥1.5 g/dL (0.93 mmol/L) from baseline without exceeding the 
upper limit of normal (ULN) Hb (efficacy criterion), with a minimal probability of 
occurrence of Grade ≥1 insomnia (safety criterion).  
2. Since the mid dose (20 mg BID) involves an intra- patient dose level increase, this dose 
level was selected such that it would result in a reasonable increase (appr oximately 2 - to 
2.5-fold) in exposure compared to the predicted exposure at the low dose level. 
3. Since the high dose (50 mg BID) also involves an intra- patient dose level increase, this 
dose level was selected such that it would result in a reasonable increase (approximately 2- to 2.5-fold) in exposure compared to the predicted exposure at the mid dose level. 
Using these criteria and simulations from the population pharmacokinetic- efficacy -safety 
analyses, doses of 5 mg BID, 20 mg BID, and 50 mg BID were sel ected for the Dose 
Optimization Period in Study AG348-C-006, which will enroll subjects with PK deficiency who 

Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 30 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  are not regularly transfused. Patients who are regularly transfused and those who do not need 
regular transfusions represent the same disease caused by [CONTACT_171040] ; therefore, the same doses have been selected for this current study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Justification of Individual Dose Optimization  
Preliminary results of the DRIVE -PK study indicate that multiple subjects had to have th eir 
randomized dose level reduced because of excess increases in Hb or the occurrence of adverse events ( AEs) such as insomnia, headache, or nausea. Dose reductions led to the resolutions of 
most of these AEs and the maintenance of a satisfactory but not e xcessive level of Hb where 
applicable.  
Individual dose optimization is incorporated in this study to allow each subject to gradually 
increase his /her dose of AG-[ADDRESS_200183]. For this reason, all subjects will start at a low dose level (5 mg 
BID) with 2 sequential steps for dose level increases (ie, from 5 to 20 mg BID and from 20 to 
50 mg BID), depending on safety (see Section  7.1.3 for dose optimization guidelines).

7.1. Study Design  
7.1.1. Overview of Study Design 
This is a 2 -part, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study consisting of a Dose Optimization Period 
(Part 1) followed by a Fixed -Dose Period (Part 2), as shown in Figure  2. This study will evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of treatment with AG -[ADDRESS_200184]’s 
complete transfusion history from 52 weeks prior to signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF)  
will be documented. This information, taken from the subject’s medical record and entered into 
the electronic case report form (eCRF), will be used to inform study eligibility and analyze data.  
All subjects will receive AG -[ADDRESS_200185]’s 
dose level of AG-348 may be increased 2 times beyond the starting dose of 5 mg BID (ie, from 5 
to 20 mg BID and from 20 to 50 mg BID). In the Fixed- Dose Period of the study (Part 2), a 
subject will receive AG -348 at his/her optimized dose with no planned adjustments (ie, as a fixed 
dose) for a fixed period of 24 weeks. 
All subjects who remain on study during Part 2 through the Week 24 Visit may be eligible for an 
open-label extension study with AG-348. Subjects who continue on into an extension study will not be required to attend the Follow-up Visit. Subjects who continue the study through the 
Part 2 Week 24 Visit on study drug but do not continue on into an extension study will attend the 
Follow-up Visit 28±[ADDRESS_200186] dose of study drug. 
Subjects who discontinue the study prior to the Part 2 Week 24 Visit should attend the End of 
Study Visit 28±[ADDRESS_200187] attended or 28±[ADDRESS_200188] can receive AG -348 in this study is 40 weeks (not 
including the dose taper). 
The Screening Period, Part 1, Part 2, and follow- up of the study are described in more detail in 
Section  7.1.2, Section  7.1.3, Section  7.1.4, and Section 7.1.5, respectively. Details for dose 
reductions or interruptions required for reasons of safety are in Section 9.3.

or to ensure that the first dose of study drug can be administered [ADDRESS_200190] recent transfusion, upon 
approval by [CONTACT_1689] (or designee ).  
7.1.2. Screening Period  
Screening will occur over an [ADDRESS_200191]’s transfusion history in the past [ADDRESS_200192] will be confirmed by [CONTACT_171041] l 
Monitor (or designee). A subject will not be considered enrolled (and cannot receive his/her first dose of study drug) until eligibility is confirmed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Transfusion History 
As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], an established method of obtaining historical control data will be 
used to collect subjects’ transfusion history at Screening. For each subject, the following 
transfusion history information for the 52 weeks prior to signing the ICF will be collected and 
recorded on the source documentation and eCRF: 
• Dates of all transfusions  
• Pre-transfusion Hb concentrations (Hb concentrations within 1 week prior to each 
transfusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) for at least 80% of the transfusions  
• For each transfusion, number of blood units transfused  
• When available, hematocrit (HCT) and volume of transfused blood units 
The transfusion history information will be used as follows: 
• To determine whether the subject meets the study crite ria for regular transfusion 
frequency (see Inclusion Criterion #4 [Section  8.1] and Exclusion Criterion #3 
[Section  8.2])  
• To calculate the Mean Transfusion Frequency (MTF)  

Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 35 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  • To calculate the Individual Transfusion Trigger (TT), which is the mean (±0.5 g/dL 
or ±0.31 mmol/L) of a subject’s collected historical pretransfusion Hb concentrations. 
For each transfusion, only the Hb concentration within [ADDRESS_200193] to a transfusion will be included in this calculation. 
 
• To calculate the Mean Number of Blood Units (MNU) transfused per transfusion 
• To function as historical control data to be used in the analysis  
The MTF (transfusion every X week[s]) will be calculated by [CONTACT_60875] [ADDRESS_200194] an MTF of every 4 weeks (52 weeks/13 transfusions = transfusion every 4 weeks). Fractional numbers will be 
rounded to the closest integer (eg, 52 weeks/17 transfusions = 3.06 weeks rounded to every 
3 weeks). All transfusions will be included in this calculation , and no attempt will be made to 
distinguish transfusions administered for cause (eg, acute infection) and transfusions 
administered systematically.  
The Individual TT will be the sum of the Hb concentrations within [ADDRESS_200195] to 
each transfusion (when available) for the transfusions in the 52-week period prior to informed 
consent divided by [CONTACT_171042], calculated 
to the first decimal point, if expre ssed in g/dL, or to the second decimal point, if expressed in 
mmol/L. A margin of ±0.5 g/dL (or ±0.31 mmol/L) will be attached to this value. For example, a 
subject who had [ADDRESS_200196] an Individual TT of 7.0±0.5 g/dL based on the following pre-transfusion Hb concentrations (g/dL): 7.0, 7.2, 6.8, 6.8, 6.7, 7.2, and 7.1. 
The MNU will be the sum of the number of units transfused at each transfusion during the 
52-week period prior to informed consent divided by [CONTACT_171043]. Fractional numbers will be rounded to the closest integer 
(eg, 13 units/6  transfusions = 2.2 units rounded to 2 units; 25 units/10 transfusions = 2.5 units 
rounded to 3 units).  
A subject’s Screening Period duration may be extended beyond 8 weeks upon the Medical 
Monitor’s (or designee’s) approval if there is a delay in obtaining a subject’s complete 
transfusion history, or the subject is projected to need a transfusion within 1 week of his/her scheduled first dose to ensure that treatment with AG -[ADDRESS_200197]'s most recent transfusion in the Screening Period (referred to as Transfusion 0). 
7.1.3. Part 1: Dose Optimization Period 
The goal of the Dose Optimization Period is to maximize a subject’s increase in Hb while 
maintaining an acceptable safety profile. All subjects will receive an initial dose of 5 mg BID of 
AG-348, with 2 sequential steps for dose level increase (ie, from 5 to 20 mg BID and from 20 to 50 mg BID; no increases beyond 50 mg BID will be allowed).  
The first dose of study drug on Day 1 should be taken at the study site following all Day 1 
assessments (with the exception of eDiary assessments) as depi[INVESTIGATOR_171001] (Section  10.14.1, Table 4).   

Study AG348-C-[ADDRESS_200198]’s Hb concentrations throughout the study in order to 
evaluate the need for a transfusion (by [CONTACT_171044]’s Hb concentration with his/her Individual TT). Investigators will assess the overall status of the subject and the subject’s 
tolerability to make a de cision on study drug dose. The following rules apply: 
• At the Week 4 Visit, study drug dose should be increased to the next dose level (ie, from 5 mg BID to 20 mg BID) if the subject has not experienced any study drug-
related safety issues.  
• The dose should be increased either at the Week [ADDRESS_200199] has reached 
his/her Individual TT (and has been transfused) between Week [ADDRESS_200200] reaches the Week 12 Visit (without having reached his/her 
Individual TT betwe en Week 8 and Week 12). In either case, the study drug dose 
should be increased to the next dose level if the subject has not experienced any study 
drug- related safety issues.  
If the dose was not increased at the Week [ADDRESS_200201] the Medical Monitor (or designee) for guidance. 
The study drug dose should not be increased at any of these visits if Hb concentration from the 
previous visits (per the central laboratory analysis) is ≥14.5 g/dL (9.0 mmol/L) in males or 
≥13.0 g/dL (8.07 mmol/L) in females.  
If the Investigator deems it necessary to reduce the study drug dose for safety reasons, the 
subject’s dose may be reduced to 1 of the 2 available lower dos e levels (ie,  5 mg BID  or 20 mg 
BID).  If the subject is already receiving 5 mg BID and/or cannot tolerate BID dosing, another 
regimen may be allowed after discussion with, and approval by, the Medical Monitor (or 
designee) . 
Dose escalation or re -introduction should be avoided after the Week 12 Visit but may be 
permitted after discussion with the Medical Monitor (or designee) for subjects who had their 
dose reduced or suspended for reasons related to safety.  
If questions arise about whether the dose level of a given subject should be increased, 
maintained, or decreased, the site is advised to contact [CONTACT_1689] (or designee) for discussion. At any time during the study, the Investigator can reduce the subject’s dose or 
interrupt study drug for reasons related to safety (as described in Section  9.3).  
Assessments and timing details for Part 1 are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4) .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Transfusions During Part [ADDRESS_200202] has 
reached his/her In dividual TT, in which case the subject should be transfused with his/her MNU 
of packed RBCs.  
Subjects, in particular those with a historical MTF of every 3 or 4 weeks, may need additional 
hematology assessments (Hb concentration) if the subject’s Individual TT has not been reached 
at a scheduled visit. Blood sampling for these additional assessments (unscheduled visits) should 

Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 37 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  be analyzed by [CONTACT_171045], in extenuating  situations , may be conducted and 
analyzed by a local laboratory or physic ian’s office local to the subject, as feasible and allowed 
by [CONTACT_171046]. 
All on -study transfusion data will be recorded as noted in Section 9.4. 
7.1.4. Part 2: Fixed- Dose Period  
In Part 2 of the study, subjects will receive their optimized dose of AG -348 for 24 weeks. Dose 
escalation or re-introduction should be avoided during Part 2 but ma y be permitted after 
discussion with the Medical Monitor (or designee) for subjects who had their dose reduced or 
suspended for reasons related to safety.  
Assessments and timing details for Part 2 are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Transfusions During Part 2  
Subjects should continue to be transfused when their Hb concentration decreases to their 
Individual TT. Some subjects may need additional hematology assessments (Hb concentration), 
for example, if the subject’s Individual TT has not been reached at a scheduled visit. Blood 
sampling for these additional assessments (unscheduled visits) should be analyzed by [CONTACT_171047], in extenuating  situations, may be conducted and analyzed by a local laboratory or 
physician’s office local to the subject, as feasible and allowed by [CONTACT_171046]. 
All on -study transfusion data will be recorded as noted in Section 9.4. 
7.1.5. Discontinuation and Follow- up 
Subjects who discontinue the study prior to the Part 2 Week 24 Visit should attend the End of 
Study Visit 28±[ADDRESS_200203] attended or 28±[ADDRESS_200204] dose of study drug, whichever is later. This visit will be identical to the Part 2 Week 24 Visit 
with these exceptions: no study drug will be dispensed at the End of Study Visit, blood sampling 
for pharmacokinetic profile will not be drawn, PKR protein will not be assessed, and if the 
subject has not already done so, they should return their eDiary and study drug. 
Subjects who continue study drug through Part [ADDRESS_200205] through the morning dose of the Part 2 Week 24 Visit. All subjects who remain on study 
during Part 2 through the Week 24 Visit may be eligible for an open- label extension study with 
AG-348. 
• Subjects who continue study drug through the Part 2 Week 24 Visit but do not 
continue on into an extension study should undergo a dose taper and then attend the 
Follow-up Visit 28±[ADDRESS_200206] dose of study drug. 
• Subjects who continue on into an extension study will not be required to attend the Follow-up Visit.  
• Subjects who initiate or are undergoing a dose taper for a reason related to safety and 
for whom participation in an extension study remains undetermined should perform 
the taper as detailed in  Section  9.3. Transition to an extension study should then be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor (or designee). 

Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0

All unused and used study drug will be retained at the site until it is inventoried by [CONTACT_171051]. All used, unused, or expi[INVESTIGATOR_171003]’s 
designee or, if authorized, disposed of at the study site per the site’s Standard Operating 
Procedures and documented. 
Study drug is expected to be dispensed to the subject at the study site. If necessary, in 
exceptional circumstances and with agreement of the Sponsor (or representative), study drug can 
be provided to the subject’s home, if acceptable by [CONTACT_171052]. 
9.1.6. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
All unused study drug must be properly disposed of in compliance with local procedures and 
governing regu lations. Documentation of the method of destruction should be maintained in the 
Investigator’s files.  
9.2. Treatment Assignment  
All subjects enrolled in this study will receive AG -348. 
9.3. Criteria for Dose Reduction and Interruption of Study Drug for 
Safety Reason s 
It is important that a subject does not abruptly interrupt study drug due to the risk of 
withdrawal hemolysis, except in case of medical emergency . 
The Investigator will monitor all subjects for safety. A subject’s dose may be reduced 
(to 5 mg  BID or 20 mg BID) or interrupted for safety reasons (ie, excessive Hb response or AEs 
considered related to study drug) as described below. Guidelines for dose modification for AEs considered related to study drug (except for events of excessive Hb response) are pro vided in 
Table 1. After careful consideration of the relative risk of maintaining the subject on the study 
drug versus withdrawal hemolysis when stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_171004], the Investigator should determine if a gradual dose taper (GDT; Table 3 ) usually 
indicated for the management of nonacute AEs, a rapid dose taper (RDT;  Table 2) usually 
indicated for the management of acute AEs or SAEs, or abrupt discontinuation of study drug usually indicated to receive emergency medical treatment is necessary. In all cases, study drug dose reductions, interruptions, or discontinuations should be discussed with the Medical Monitor 
(or designee). 

Study AG348-C-[ADDRESS_200225] with an excessive Hb response higher than 2 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) below the ULN 
(ie, higher than 15.0 g/dL [9.31 mmol/L] in men and 13.5 g/dL [8.38 mmol/L] in women) up to 
the ULN (ie, 17.0 g/dL [10.55 mmol/L] in men and 15.5 g/dL [9.62 mmol/L] in women), a dose 
decrease should be considered for the subject to the next lower dose level, without a need for taper (ie, if the subject experienced an excessive Hb response at 50 mg BID, his/her dose will be 
decreased to 20 mg BID). The same rule applies to the decrease from [ADDRESS_200226]’s dose will be decreased to the next lower dose level without a need for 
taper (ie, if the subject experienced an excessive Hb response at 50 mg BID, his/her dose will be 
decreased t o 20 mg BID). The same rule applies to the decrease from 20 mg BID to 5 mg  BID.

of the following options is appropriate:  
• Maintaining the current dose, or 
• Performing a dose taper, or  
• Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_171006], then no dose changes are required. At least once weekly monitoring should be performed until the event resolves to baseline or Grade 1 (whichever is lower). If the 
event persists, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_171007] a dose taper 
should be considered. 
If the decision is made to stop the study drug abruptly or perform a dose taper, 
the below instructions should be followed for re-introduction or escalation of 
the study drug, respectively.  
In all cases, re- introduction and escalation of study drug should be 
performed only after discussion with the Medical Monitor (or desig nee).

• Restarting treatment after dosing was stopped:  
Once the event resolves to baseline or Grade 1 (whichever is lower) 
and the decision is made to restart AG -348, the study drug should be 
re-introduced at the [ADDRESS_200229] 4 weeks on 5 mg BID (with at least once weekly monitoring), the dose may be increased from [ADDRESS_200230] 4 weeks on 20  mg BID (with 
at least once weekly monitoring), the dose may be increased from 
20 mg BID to 50 mg BID.

Event(s) Severity  Dose Modification  
drug):  
If during the dose taper, the event resolves to baseline or Grade 1 
(whichever is lower), the study drug should be maintained at the dose 
at which the event resolved for at least 4 weeks (with at least once 
weekly monitoring). If the event does not reoccur after at least [ADDRESS_200231] BID dose (5 mg BID, 20 mg BID, or 50 mg BID) with at least 
once weekly monitoring. If the event does not reoccur after at least 4 
weeks (with at least once weekly monitoring), and the subject is not 
already receiving [ADDRESS_200232] cannot tolerate BID dosing, another 
regimen may be allowed after discussion with, and approval by, the Medical 
Monitor (or designee) . If the AE does not resolve to baseline or Grade 1 
(whichever is lower) after the dose is decreased, it should be considered to decrease the dose further. If the AE still does not resolve, dose should be permanently discontinued.
 
Grade 4  After careful consideration of the relative risk of withdrawal hemolysis when 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_171005]-348 abruptly versus reducing the dose rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], the Investigator 
should determine which of the following options is appropriate: 
• Performing a rapid dose taper or

9.3.2. Gradual Dose Taper 
In subjects undergoing a GDT, the regimen detailed below and in Table 3  will be followed.  
For subjects on either 5 mg BID or 20 mg BID of study drug, the GDT will start with subjects 
reducing the frequency of dosing from their usual regimen of 1 tablet BID to 1 tablet QD for 7 days, followed by 1 tablet QOD for 7 days prior to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_171009] (see  Table 
3).  
For subjects on 50 mg BID, the GDT will start with subjects reducing the frequency of dosing from their usual regimen of 1 tablet BID to 1 tablet QD for 7 days; then they will switch to 
1 tablet of 20 mg QD for 7 days, followed by 1 tablet 20 mg QOD for 7 days prior to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_171010] (see Table 3 ). Dose tapers may be discussed with the Medical Monitor (or 
designee) .
 
Subjects going through a GDT should be monitored for signs of hemolysis and worsening of anemia. If a GDT is performed to discontinue dosing permanently, subjects may stop taking the study drug after the taper has been completed.

9.4. Transfusions  
Transfusion history should be recorded as noted in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Transfusion(s) during the Screening Period will be administered according to the usual care of 
the subject (ie, without regard to the subject’s Individual TT) and will be recorded but not 
included in the subject’s transfusion history. During the Screening Period, the last transfusion 
should be administered [ADDRESS_200237]’s completion of the 
study. All prior and concomitant medications must be recorded in the appropriate section of the 
source documentation and eCRF along with any dosage information, dates of administration, mode of administration, and reason for use. For non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], please reference Section  9.6. 

Study AG348-C-[ADDRESS_200238] shown that AG-348 is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (>70%), with minor contributions from CYP2C9, 
CYP2C8, and CYP1A2. In addition, AG-[ADDRESS_200239] of concomitant therapy to be avoided and concomitant 
therapy requiring careful monitoring. 
The following are prohibited at all times during participation in this study:  
• Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Appendix 5 of the AG- 348 IB)  
• Products known to inhibit CYP3A4, such as grapefruit or grapefruit juice  
• Strong inducers of CYP3A4 (listed in Appendix 5 of the AG- 348 IB ) 
• Strong inhibitors of P- gp (listed in Appendix 5 of the AG- 348 IB ) 
• Digoxin, a P-gp transporter- sensitive substrate  
If a subject is taking any medication listed in the AG -348 IB and/or digoxin prior to enrolling in 
the study, the medication must be discontinued at least 5 days or a time frame equivalent to 
5 half -lives (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1 dosing. 
• Hematopoietic stimulating agents (eg, EPOs , granulocyte colony stimulating factors, 
thrombopoietins) must be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_200240] be repleted to stability of the Hb and mean corpuscular volume ( MCV ) prior to enrollment in the study. 
• Anabolic steroids, including testosterone preparations, administered for anemia must 
be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_200241] dose of study drug. 
The medications that fall under the categories mentioned below should be avoided and replaced 
with alternative treatments. If this is not possible, subjects receiving these medications should be 
carefully monitored. A general monitoring guideline for Inves tigators whose subjects take 
medications that fall under the categories mentioned below is as follows: Investigators must 
monitor subjects for lack of efficacy of the prescribed medication or for side effects arising from 
the medication. If either a lack of efficacy of the prescribed medication or side effects suspected 
to be related to the prescribed medication are noticed, then the Investigator should make appropriate modifications to the dose of the prescribed medication or find alternatives to the 
prescribed medication. 
• Corticosteroids (sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 and weak CYP3A4 inducers)

Confidential 50 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  • Sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 (listed in Appendix 5 of the AG- 348 IB ) 
• Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Appendix 5 of the AG- 348 IB ) 
• Sensitive substrates of CYP2B6 (listed in Appendix 5 of the AG- 348 IB ) 
• Proton-pump inhibitors and H 2-receptor antagonists (listed in Appendix 5 of the 
AG-348 IB ). Antacids, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, can 
be used with AG-348. 
AG-348, being a potential CYP3A4 inducer, has the potential to reduce the effectiveness of oral 
contraceptives. Therefore, women using oral contraceptives must also utilize a barrier method 
contraceptive while enrolled in the study and until at least [ADDRESS_200242] dose of s tudy 
drug, as specified in Inclusion Criterion #9 (see Section  8.1).  
9.5.2. Allowed Concomitant Medications 
Medications other than those specified above (Section 9.5.1) are permitted during the study. All intercurrent medical conditions will be treated at the discretion of the Investigator according to 
acceptable local standards of medical care. Subjects may receive analgesics, antiemetics, anti-infectives, an d antipyretics as medically indicated and consistent with the guidance in 
Section  9.5.1.  
Subjects may continue iron chelation therapy with deferoxamine, deferasirox, or deferiprone. As iron overload is a long-term complication of PK deficiency, any initiation, completion, or change 
of iron chelation therapy will be of particular interest. Data about chelation therapy use will be 
carefully collected.  
Subjects must continue taking at least 0.8 mg oral folic acid daily for the duration of the study.

Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 51 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  10. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The timing of all study assessments is indicated in the Schedule of Assessments for Part 1 
(Table 4) and Part 2 ( Table 5 ) of the study. 
10.1. Informed Consent  
A description of the study is to be presented to each potential subject and a signed and dated ICF 
is to be obtained before any study- specific procedures are per formed. The ICF will contain a 
separate section regarding the option to use leftover biological samples for analysis of additional 
biomarkers; subjects may opt in or decline; this will not affect their eligibility for the study.  
10.2. Study Eligibility 
A subject ’s eligibility will be assessed and confirmed during the Screening Period. The 
Investigator will determine whether each subject meets all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Eligibility of each subject will be confirmed by [CONTACT_171041] l Monitor (or 
designee) . A subject will not be considered enrolled (and cannot receive his/her first dose of 
study drug) until eligibility is confirmed.  
If a subject is determined to be ineligible for the study, the subject will be excluded from 
participation.  
If study ineligibility is due to a transient condition (eg, prohibited concomitant medication), the 
subject could be rescreened after the criterion  that the subject failed to meet has resolved. In the 
case of a subject declared ineligible according to a previous version of the protocol, the subject may be rescreened if the subject could be eligible according to the current version of the protocol. 
The following assessments will not need to be repeated at rescreening if they were performed 
correctly at Screening: transfusion history unless additional transfusions have been administered, 
demographics, medical/surgical history unless new information needs to be added, liver MRI 
unless done more than 6 months prior, DXA scan unless done more than 6 months prior, and 
PKLR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
10.3. Medical and Surgical History  
All medical and surgical history deemed to be relevant per the Investigator (in particular, pertaining, but not limited to , the diagnosis of PK deficiency) and current medical conditions are 
to be recorded on the source documentation and included in the eCRF during Screening.  
Prior history of splenectomy and/or cholecystectomy must be documented and included in the 
eCRF during Screening for all subjects. 
10.3.1. Iron Overload- Related History  
Historical use of chelation therapy for the 12 months prior to signing the ICF should be recorded, 
including type of iron chelation therapy, start date, stop date, and dose. Additionally, serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and LIC data should be recorded for the 12 months prior to signing 
the ICF.

Confidential 52 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  10.4. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications will be captured as described in Section 9.5 and per the 
Schedule of Assessments (Section  10.14.1).  
10.5. PKLR  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_171014] (ie, missense or non- missense) will be 
performed during Screening by a central genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_171015].  
10.6. Demographics  
Subject de mographic data w ill include gender, year of birth, race, and ethnicity. 
Race and ethnicity data will be collected to ensure that any race - and ethnicity- related 
specificities in the safety, pharmacokinetics, and/or efficacy of AG -348 can be captured and 
interpreted accurately.  
Collection of demographic data will be modified by [CONTACT_171053], as appropriate.  
10.7. Assessment of Efficacy  
10.7.1. Transf usion Burden  
Transfusion burden (number of RBC units received over a 24- week period) will be assessed 
based on the transfusion information collected in Part 2 of the study. Information on transfusions 
administered during the study will be recorded as speci fied in Section  9.4. 
10.8. Assessments of Safety  
10.8.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be recorded and will include systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, and body 
temperature.  
10.8.2. Physical Examination 
Complete physical examination s will be performed according to the Schedules of Assessments 
(Section  10.14.1) and additionally when clinically indicated, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Height will be documented during Screening only. 
10.8.3. Laboratory Assessments 
Safety laboratory assessments are described in Section  10.9.1. 
10.8.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs should be performed following 5 minutes of recumbency and in triplicate 
using the ECG machine provided by [CONTACT_171054]. The 
ECG at Part 2 Week 24 will be performed prior to, but within the same window as, the 

Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 53 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  pharmacokinetic sample collected 1  hour (±5 minutes) after the study drug dose administration 
to align with the approximate T max (time to maximum [peak] concentr ation) of the study drug. 
The ECGs will be read promptly by a qualified physician at the study site to detect any eligibility 
or safety issue. Only QTcF (not heart rate- corrected QT interval by [CONTACT_35019]’s method [QTcB]) 
will be used for determination of eligibility. In addition to the local read, the ECGs will be sent 
promptly to the central vendor for a data analysis read.  
An ECG will be repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed, if artifacts are 
present, or if machine/equipment errors occur.  
10.8.5. Dual -Energy X -ray Absorptiometry Scans 
The DXA scans of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_147168] (trochanter and inter- trochanter, which 
comprise the total hip and femoral neck) will be performed according to the instructions 
provided by [CONTACT_112726] (see vendor’s manual for details). The DXA scans will be 
transmitted promptly to the central vendor for assessment of technical adequacy and may have to 
be repeated (before first dose for the screening DXA scan) if not technically adequate. The DXA scans  will be read and interpreted by [CONTACT_112726]. 
10.8.6. Menstrual Cycle Diary  
Menstruating female subjects will be required to fill out an electronic menstrual cycle diary for each menstrual period in order to detect any change in menstrual cycles. Subjects w ill record the 
start date, stop date, and any notable characteristics of each menstrual cycle in the eDiary 
provided at Screening. 
10.9. Laboratory Assessments  
All clinical laboratory evaluations are to be performed by a central laboratory. If Investigators 
believe that it is clinically indicated to obtain urgent safety laboratory results from their own 
local laboratories on the day of the subject’s visit and before the results are returned from the designated central laboratory, they are free to exercise their d iscretion to do so. In this case, a 
sample should be sent, in parallel, to the central laboratory. Decisions about subject eligibility 
and subjects’ management are to be based on the results obtained from the central laboratory, 
unless an urgent safety iss ue requires performing a local test, and except for pregnancy testing 
from Day 1 until the end of the study, which should be done locally. 
Blood samples for clinical evaluations will be collected according to the Schedules of 
Assessments (Section  10.14.1). All blood sample draws for screening tests should be performed 
as long after a previous transfusion as possible. In addition, all clinically signif icant laboratory 
abnormalities noted on testing will be followed by [CONTACT_171055].  
Safety laboratory assessments and other laboratory assessments are listed in Section  10.9.1 and 
Section  10.9.2, respectively.

(± 5 minutes), 2 hours (±5 minutes), 4 hours (±30 minutes), and 8 hours  (±30 minutes) postdose. On days of pharmacokinetic blood sample collection, the morning dose of 
study drug must be administered at the study site; on days where a predose sample is required, the study drug must be adminis tered after the predose sample is taken.  
20 Samples for PKR protein are to be collected predose (within 60 minutes prior to study drug administration). On days of sample  collection, the morning dose of study drug 
must be administered at the study site following the predose collections.  

Study AG348-C-[ADDRESS_200283] at the study site. If necessary, in exceptional circumstances and with agreement of the Sponsor (or representative), study 
drug can be provided to the subject’s home, if acceptable by [CONTACT_171052] . 
[ADDRESS_200284]’s completion of study or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. 
All AEs will be monitored until resolution of the AE  to baseline, the AE is considered stable 
within the context of the trial, the subject is lost to follow -up, or until [ADDRESS_200285] initiates an extension study, in which case the SAE follow-up 
information will be reported in the extension study database. Any SAEs that are assessed as related to study drug that occur ≥[ADDRESS_200286] a causal 
relationship with the study drug. An AE can, therefore , be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with  the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product. 
Pre-existing conditions that worsen during a study are to be reported as AEs. Withdrawal 
hemolysis is to be reported as a study drug- related AE.  
11.2.2. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or the Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  

Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 68 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  • Life threatening (meaning that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the  
reaction as it occurred , but it does not include a reaction that hypothetically might 
have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form) 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171016]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period but planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed 
before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the study (eg, surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15977], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
11.2.3. Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (eg, cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary 
events. However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Please refer to the eCRF completion guidance for examples of how to record events occurring 
secondary to other events. 
All AEs should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether 
the events are associated.  
11.2.4. Pre-existing Medical Conditions  
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present during Screening for this study. Such 
conditions should be recorded on the Medical History eCRF. 
A pre -existing medical condition should be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, severity, or 
character of the condi tion worsens during the study. When recording such events on the Adverse 
Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the pre-existing condition has changed by 
[CONTACT_9672] (eg, “more frequent headaches”). 
Study AG348-C-[ADDRESS_200287] result should be reported as an AE if 
it meets any of the following criteria:  
a. Accompanied by [CONTACT_171060]  
b. Results in a change in study drug (eg, dosage modification, treatment interruption, or 
treatment discontinuation)  
c. Results in a medical intervention (eg, potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy  
d. Clinicall y significant in the Investigator’s judgment 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be 
classified as an AE. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the 
diagnosis should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range.  
11.2.6. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI can be serious or nonserious. Ongoing monitoring and rapid communication (within 24 hours) by [CONTACT_171061].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Transaminase Increase  
Transaminase increase is an AESI for AG -348. In the event of a transaminase increase of 
>2.5 × baseline (defined as the mean of the Screening and Day 1 values) or an increase in AST 
or ALT to Grade ≥[ADDRESS_200288] decreased to 
<2.5 × baseline (defined as the average  of the Screening and Day 1 values). Additionally, the 
following tests should be performed to gain further information on the possible cause of the 
transaminase increase:  
1. Rule out biliary obstruction by [CONTACT_171062] (liver CT scan, liver MRI, liver ultrasound, or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, as clinically indicated) .  
2. Viral screen for Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) Ab s, cytomegalovirus (CMV) Abs , Hepatitis A 
Ab, HBsAg, HCVAb (with a n RT -PCR test performed if HCVAb is positive), HIV-1Ab, 
and HIV-2Ab using the central laboratory. 
3. Autoimmune hepatitis panel consisting of the following: serum antinuclear antibody, 
antismooth muscle antibody, liver-kidney microsomal type [ADDRESS_200289] time.  
The Investigator should refer to Section 9.3 to determine if a dose adju stment is needed. If the 
Investigator is not sure whether or not a dose adjustment is needed, they should consult with the 
Medical Monitor (or designee). 
11.3. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events, Adverse Events of Special 
Interest, and Serious Adverse Event s 
Each subject must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs. This information 
should be obtained in the form of nonleading questions (eg, “How are you feeling?”) and from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations of study personnel, and 
spontaneous reports from subjects. 
The Investigator should ask the subject for information regarding sleep patterns, signs, and 
symptoms associated with insomnia.  
All AEs (serious and nonserious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination , or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. Any clinical ly 
relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an AE and 
must be recorded on the appropriate pages of the eCRF. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as [ADDRESS_200290] be reported whether or not they are 
considered causally related to the study drug.  
In the event that the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable, a paper SAE and fax 
coversheet should be completed and faxed/emailed to the Sponsor within no more than [ADDRESS_200291] details provided to Investigators in the Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form Completion Guidelines. 
Excessive Hb responses should only be reported as an AE if they meet the criteria for Hb 
increased per CTCAE (ie, Hb concentration is higher than the subject’s gender- specific ULN). 
Any reports of excessive Hb response should be graded using the CTCAE grading system. 
If there are serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions associated with the use of AG -348, the 
Sponsor will notify the appropriate regulatory agency(ies) and all participating Investigators on 
an expedited basis. The local IRB/IEC will be promptly notified based on local regulations where required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC of all serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions involving risk 
to human subjects. 
11.3.1. Intensity  
The intensity of all AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE. It is important to 
distinguish between SAEs and AEs with a severe intensity. An AE of severe intensity may not be 
considered serious. Severity is a measure o f intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_171063]348-C-[ADDRESS_200292] that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171017].  
Severity of all AEs, including clinically significant treatment -emergent laboratory abnormalities, 
will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. Adverse events not listed by [CONTACT_12544]: 
• Mild (Grade 1): The event is noticeable to the subject but does not interfere with 
routine activi ty. 
• Moderate (Grade 2): The event interferes with routine activity but responds to symptomatic therapy or rest.  
• Severe (Grade 3): The event significantly limits the subject’s ability to perform 
routine activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795].  
• Life threateni ng (Grade 4): An event in which the subject is at risk of death at the 
time of the event.  
• Fatal (Grade 5): An event that results in the death of the subject.  
11.3.2. Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship to study drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_25311]: 
• Not Related: AEs will be considered related unless they fulfill the criteria as specified below:  
o Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug 
(eg, pre-existing medical condition, unde rlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
concomitant medication); and/or  
o The AE has no plausible temporal relationship to the administration of the study drug (eg, cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_200293] dose of study drug). 
• Related: AEs will be considered related if they fulfill the criteria as specified below: 
o There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of the study drug, and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state, intercurrent illne ss, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or 
o The AE follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or 
o The AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re- challenge.  
11.4. Pregnancy Reportin g 
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE, unless a complication relating to the pregnancy occurs (eg, spontaneous abortion, which may qualify as an SAE). However, any pregnancy in a 
participating female subject that occurs during this study or within [ADDRESS_200294] be reported to the Sponsor or Medical Monitor (or designee) within 
[ADDRESS_200295] be reported to the Sponsor or Medical Monitor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_200296] be reported by [CONTACT_171064]’s designee on a 
Pregnancy Outcome Report form within 28 days after he/she has gained knowledge of the 
delivery or elective abortion.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy in a female study participant or consented female sexual partner of a male participant  must be recorded on the SAE report form (eg, maternal serious 
complications, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
congenital anomaly, or birth defect) and reported within [ADDRESS_200297] dose of study drug for men . Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, 
symptothermal, and post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.

Confidential 73 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  12. STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1. Sample Size and Power  
Due to the rarity of the disease and the small patient population, the sample size is largely driven 
by [CONTACT_5870]. Given the feasibility results and uncertainty of the screen failure rate, the study 
will enroll a minimum of 20, with up to 40, subjects. With a sample size of 20, the power of the 
study is limited, that is, the power will be 58% to detect a response rate o f 30% compared to a 
null rate of 10% with an exact test at 2 -sided 0.05 significance level. There will be 75% power to 
detect  a large response rate of 35%, compared to the null of 10%. When the sample size is 40, 
the power will be at least 90%, even if the target response rate is 30%. The power for different 
scenarios is listed in Table 6.

Abbreviation: AE = adverse event.  
12.2. Analysis Sets 
Assignment of subjects to analysis sets will be done before the clinical database lock for the 
study. All Subjects will refer to  all subjects who were enrolled or dosed (ie, all  subjects in the 
study).  
Two analysis sets will be defined for evaluation of the study endpoints: Full Analysis Set (FAS) and Per Protocol Set (PPS).  
12.2.1. Full Analysis Set  
The FAS is defined as all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_200299] completed Part 2.  
The PPS will be used for sensitivity analysis as specified in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
12.3. Statistical Analysis  
This section presents a summary of the planned primary analyses of efficacy and safety for this 
study. Additional supportive and exploratory analyses will be specified in the final statistical 
analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized before the database lock.  
12.3.1. General Methods  
All individual subject data for all subjects will be presented in data listings.  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max).  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
Baseline value: Unless otherwise specified, the baseline value will be defined as the most recent 
nonmissing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the initial administration 
of study drug.  
• For hematology parameters, the most recent nonmissing measurements prior to 
Transfusion 0 (the most recent transfusion occurring in the Screening Period prior to 
the start of study drug on Day 1) will be defined as the baseline. This is to limit the impact of transfusion on these he matology laboratory parameters.  
• Historical transfusion frequency will be based on the historical data during the 
52 weeks prior to screening. Details are specified in Section  12.3.2.  
• For transaminases (AST and ALT), the baseline will be defined as the average of the 
assessment of the Screening and Day 1 values.  
Change (Absolute Change) from baseline  will be calculated as postbaseline value - baseline 
value.  
Relative change from baseline will be calculated and presented in percentage as 
100 × (postbaseline value - baseline value)  / baseline value.  
Treatment -emergent period  is defined as from the first dose of study drug to [ADDRESS_200300] d ata listings. All summaries will be based on the FAS unless 
otherwise specified in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subject Disposition  
Number and percentage of subjects in the following categories will be summarized as 
appropriate: 
• Enrolled 
• Dosed (FAS)  
• Completed treatment in Pa rt 1 
• Prematurely discontinued treatment in Part 1 and the reasons for discontinuation 
• Completed treatment in Part 2 (PPS)  
• Prematurely discontinued treatment in Part 2 and the reasons for discontinuation 
• Completed study 
• Prematurely discontinued the study and the reasons for discontinuation 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic, background (eg, medical history), and baseline characteristics will be summarized. The demographics, baseline characteristics, and medical history summary will be 
presented for the FAS.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications used in this study will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary Enhanced and categorized as the following:  
• Prior medication:  any medication that started before initial dosing of study drug, 
regardless of when it ended  
• Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received during the 
treatment -emergent period 
• Post-treatment medication:  medication continued or newly received after the 
treatment -emergent period, if the subject is still enrolled in the study  
A given medication can be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a 
post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post- treatment; or 
prior, concomitant, and post -treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing 
start/end date or time and it cannot be determined whether it was taken before, during, or after the treatment -emergent period, it wi ll be considered as prior, concomitant, and post- treatment  
medications.  
Prior medications and concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively based on the FAS. Post- treatment medications will be listed for each subject.  
Study AG348-C-007  Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0 
Confidential 76 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  12.3.3. Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Drug Exposure  
Duration of study drug exposure is defined as follows: last dose date − first dose date + [ADDRESS_200301]’s treatment discontinuation or completion date will be used for analysis purposes. 
Duration of study drug exposure will be summarized descriptively as a quantitative variable (n, 
mean, SD, median, min , and max ). 
Exposure summaries will be based on FAS. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Drug Compliance  
Study drug compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_171065]. The percentage of days on treatment will be calculated as follows:  
100 × total number of single days on study drug / (duration of study drug exposure + total 
number of days study drug interrupted after last dose, if any)  
Single day on study drug is collected from the subject’s diary data. If it is unknown whether the 
subject received treatment on a specified day , then it will be assumed that no treatment was taken 
on that day. 
Percentage of tablets taken will be calculated as follows:  
100 × (total number of tablets administered) / (total number of tablets intended)  
Both percentage of days on treatment and percentage of tablets taken will be summarized 
descriptively as quantitative variables ( n, mean, SD, median, min, and max). The number and 
percentage of subjects whose compliance is <80% or ≥80% will be summarized. 
Study drug compliance will be based on the FAS.  
12.3.4. Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of Transfusion Reduction 
Historical transfusion RBC units standardized to 24 weeks will be calculated as the total number 
of transfusion RBC units over the 52 weeks prior to the informed consent × 24/52. The Part [ADDRESS_200302] full dose before starting the dose 
taper (if applicable) in Part 2 divided by [CONTACT_171066] × 168 (24 weeks).  
Both the historical transfusion RBC units standardized to 24 weeks and on-study 24- week 
transfusion RBC units will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, 
min, and max). The change in transfusion RBC units (calculated as the on-study 24- week 
transfusion RBC units – historical transfusion RBC units standardized to 24 w eeks)  and the 
percentage change (calculated as [on -study 24-week transfusion RBC units – historical 
transfusion RBC units standardized to 24 weeks] / historical transfusion RBC units standardized 
to 24 weeks) will also be summarized based on the FAS. In addition, the number and percentage

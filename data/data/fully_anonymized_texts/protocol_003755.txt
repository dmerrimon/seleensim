Study Design This is a single-masked, 2×3 crossover, randomized-
controlled, dispensing clinical trial. Approximately 70
hyperopic eligible subjects will be  targeted to complete the 
study.  Eligible subjects will be randomized and fit at Visit 1
ina study lens based on the randomization scheme. Subjects 
will be dispensed lenses at Visit 1 for 3±1 day, then undergo 
optimization (Visit 2). Subjects will wear the optimized pair 
for approximately 1 week (7±1 day). After approximately 1-
week of wear, (Visit 3) the study endpoints will be measured 
and subjects will be fit in the 2ndstudy lens. The visits will be 
repeated wearing the 2ndstudy lens (Visit 3 Fit/Visit 4 
Optimization/Visit 5 Follow up). At Visit 5 the subjects will 
be fit in the 3rdstudy lens that match the same power they were 
dispensed at Visit 4 and wore to Visit 5 and wear the lenses
for 1 week (7±1 day). After approximately 1- week of wear, 
(Visit 6) the study endpoints will be measured and the subject 
will be exited from the study.
See the flow chart at the end of the synopsis table for the 
schematic of the study visits and procedures of main observations (Figure 1).

2.STUDY OBJECTIVES, ENDPOINTS AND HYPOTHESES  
2.1. Objectives  
The objective of this study is toevaluat ethe visual performance (logMAR) and subjective 
vision response sof the Investigational Multifocal Contact [CONTACT_288778] 
A C3 material (Test) compare dto the Dailies Total 1® Multifocal Contact [CONTACT_32993] (Control)
manufactured in delefilcon A material .
2.2. Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint :
Visual Performance (logMAR)
Multiple assessments of binocular  and monocular visual acuity will be made during the study, 
but the binocular measurements made at the 1-week follow -up evaluation using high contrast 
letters in bright illuminance conditions will be the primary end point. At distance (4 meters), 
VA is assessed using ETDRS Charts; while near (40 cm) and intermediate (64 cm) assessments 
will be made using reduced Guillon -Poling charts. Visual acuity will be measured using high 
and low contrast charts in bright illumina nce conditions. Visual acuity will also be measured 
using high contrast charts in dim illumina nce conditions created by [CONTACT_93839]. See 
,  and  in Appendix I for details regarding the collection of 
visual acuity (logMAR).
Secondary Endpoint :
Subjective Vision 
Subjective vision will be assessed using the Contact [CONTACT_169754] (CLUE™) 
questionnaire at the 1 -Week follow -up evaluation.  CLUE™ is a validated patient -reported 
outcomes questionnaire to assess patient -experience attributes of soft, disposable co ntact Clinical Study Protocol

lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact -lens wearing population in the 
US, ages 18 -65.  Derived CLUE™ scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal 
distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where hig her scores indicate a more 
favorable/positive response with a range of 0 -120.  A 5 -point increase in an average CLUE™ 
score translates into 10% shift in the distribut ion of scores for population of soft contact [CONTACT_89626].6

4.STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE  
4.1. Description of Study Design  
This is a [ADDRESS_1089066] -masked, multi -site, 2 ×3crossover dispensing trial. Approximately 80
subjects will be enrolled with an aim of approximately 70subjects to co mplete the study. Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
CR-6392, v3.0  
Page 21 of 244JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
The study begins with an initial visit (V isit 1). If a subject is found to meet all eligibility criteria, 
they will be randomized to one of two lens wear sequences (Test/Control /Control or 
Control/Test /Test ) in a bilateral fashion. 
If the subject is dispensed study lenses at the initial visit, five addi tional visits will be 
conducted. T he first follow -up visit (Visit 2) will occur 3 ± 1 days after the initial visit. At visit 
2, subjects will undergo lens optimization if necessary. Subjects will wear the study lenses for 
7 ± [ADDRESS_1089067] follow -up visit (Visit 4)3± 1 days after Visit 3, for lens optimization .Subjects will 
return for t heir second follow -up visit 7 ± [ADDRESS_1089068] study lens per the randomization schedule and wear the lens for (7±1 day s).
At the follow -up(Visit6)the endpoints will again be measured and the subje ct will be exited 
from the study.
4.2. Study Design Rationale  
Crossover designs are a well -established study design in which subjects are exposed to multiple 
treatments during different time periods.  A 2×3bilateral crossover design was considered to 
be the o ptimal design since the study period is relatively  short the design can be cost effective 
and more efficient comparisons between tr eatments can be made than compared toa parallel 
study since fewer subjects are required to achieve the same pre -specified st atistical power. 
Each subject will act as their own control to reduce the influence of potential confounding factors 
such as age, gender and vision correction .
4.3. Enrollment Target and Study Duration  
Approximately 80eligible s ubjects will be enrolled with the aim of approximately 70to 
complete the study. The study will last approximately [ADDRESS_1089069] Article Allocation  
Thestudy lenses will be worn in a bilateral and random fashion usin g a 2× 3crossover design. 
A computer -generated randomization scheme will be used to randomly assign subjects, in 
block sof4, to one of the two possible lens wear sequences: Test/Control /Control or 
Control/Test /Test . The random scheme will be generated usi ng the PROC PLAN procedure 
from Statistical Analysis System (SAS) Softwa re Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC)9.
The study site must follow the randomization scheme provided and complete enrollment per 
the randomization list and not pre -select or assign subjects.  The randomized assignment of 
subjects will be performed at the first visit prior to the first fitting.  The following must have 
occurred prior to randomization:Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
CR-6392, v3.[ADDRESS_1089070] meets all the inclusion / exc lusion criteria
oSubject history and baseline in formation has been collected.
5.2. Masking  
This is a single -masked study with the subjects being masked.  The term partial masking is 
being used as subjects will not be to ld any information regarding the optical de signs of the 
lenses beyond that they are intended to correct for their refractive error and presby[CONTACT_19555], 
however there are slight differen ces in the tint of the lenses which is impossible to mask from 
the subject.   
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broke n until all subjects have completed 
the study and the datab ase is finalized. Otherwise, the mas k should be broken only if specific 
emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_126110]. In such cases, the Investigator may, in an emergency, contact [CONTACT_7195].  In 
the event the mask is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, 
time, and reason for the unmasking mu st be documented in the subject record. The Investigator 
is also advised not to reveal the study trea tment assignment to the clinical site or Sponsor 
personnel. 
Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unmasked are expected to return for all 
rema ining scheduled evaluations.  Subjects who are discontinued may be replaced.
5.3. Procedures for Maintaining and Breaking the Masking  
The test articles mask shall not be broken unl ess information concerning the lens type is 
necessary for the urgent medical trea tment of a subject. The Sponsor must be notified before 
the mask is broken.
When dispensing test articles, the following steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes:
1.Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens
fitting schedule/randomization scheme to ob tain the test article assignment for that 
subject prior to dispensing .
2.Investigator or designee will record the subj ect’s number on the appropriate line of the 
randomization scheme if applicable
3.Investigator or designee will pull the appropriate test articles from the study supply. 
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed 
outside the clinical site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountability 
Log in t he “Dispensed” section .Clinical Study Protocol

for the test article accountability records. 
Test article smust be kept in a locked storage cabinet, a ccessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this activity to authorized study site 
personnel listed on the Site Delegation Log. All test articles must be accounted. This includes:
1.What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or issued 
for the subject to replace appropriately between visits .
2.What was returned to the Investigator unused ,including expi[INVESTIGATOR_93785].
3.The number and reason for unplanned replacements .
The Investigator will collect all unused test articles  from the subjects at the end of the subject’s 
participation. Subject returned unused test articles must be separated from the clinical study 
inventory of un -dispensed test art icles and must be labeled with  the subject number and date 
of return. Following final reconciliation of test articles by [CONTACT_2037], the Investigator or 
monitor will return all unused test articles toJJVC .

10.DEVIATIONS FROM THE PROTOCOL  
Investigator will notify study sponsor upon identification of a protocol deviation. Protocol 
deviations must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after discovery of the protocol 
deviation. The Investigator will report  deviations per IRB/IEC requireme nts. All deviations 
will be tracked and corrective act ions implemented as appropriate. 
If it becomes necessary for the Investigator to implement a deviation in order to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the trial subject, the Investigator may implement th e deviation 
immediately without notification to the spons or. Within [ADDRESS_1089193] notify and provi de the rationale to the Sponsor and, as 
required, the IEC/IRB. 
If the deviation potentially impacts the sa fety of patient or changes the technical integrity of 
the study then it must be reported to IEC/ IRB. This is a "Major Deviation" .
Minor deviations have no substantive effect on patien t safety or technical integrity of the 
study. They are often logist ical in nature. The informed consent must also not be contradicted 
by [CONTACT_89629].
Protocol waivers are prohibited .
11.STUDY TERMINATION  
The occurrence of one or more Unanticipate d Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE), or 
any SAE where the relationship to study agent cannot be ruled out, may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35446]. In the event of a [LOCATION_003]DE or SAE, the Sponsor may unmask 
the treatment regimen for the subject(s) and w ill discuss this with the Investigator before any 
further subj ects are enrolled.
The Sponsor will determine when a study will be stopped. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_126095]’s results are compromised.
JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason. Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study  if an unreasonable risk is determined. The Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.

study can be terminated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_790329], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC , it is determined 
that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events. If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unre asonable risk, the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated as soon as possible.
Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as sch eduled), the Investigator will 
notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as required by [CONTACT_35512].
12.PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS  
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any written, electronic, or oral communic ation 
that alleges deficiencies relate d to the identity, quality, dura bility, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after th ey have been released for clinical trial use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of source s including but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations managers (COM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered product quality complaints:
xSubject satisfaction inquiries reported via “Subjective Questi onnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO) .”
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the 
investigational site .
xLens replacements that occur due to drops/fall -outs.
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_790344] d by [CONTACT_288796], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations where 
there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_423] .
Within [ADDRESS_1089194] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will tr igger an automatic email notification to the 
appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use 
is not configured to send automatic notification s or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.  
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/CR A will contact [CONTACT_19568]: 
xDate the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness) .
xWho received the complaint .
xStudy number .
xClinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number) .
xLot number(s) .
xUnique Subject Identifier(s) .
xIndication of who first observed complaint (site personnel or subject) .Clinical Study Protocol

xOD/OS indication, along with whether the lens was inserted .
xAny related AE number if applicable .
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.) .
xEye Care Provider objective (sli t lamp) findings if applicable .
xConfirmation of product availability for return  (and tracking information, if available), 
or rationale if product is not available for return 
Once a complaint is received, it will be asse ssed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Seri ous Adverse Event (AE/SAE). If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or traine d site personnel will follow Section 13of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a product quality related deficiency, these 
procedures also applies and will be executed in parallel.  
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514]. In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be 
documented.
13.ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1. Definitions and Classifications  
Adverse Event (AE) –An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in su bjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not related to  the investigational medical device. 
This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the 
comparator , and to the procedures involved .For users or other persons, this definition is 
restricted to events related to investigational medical devices1
An AE includes any condition (including a pre -existing condition) that:
1.Was n ot present prior to the study, but appeared or reappeared following initiation of 
the study .
2.Was present prior to the study, but worsened during the study. This would include any 
condition resulting from concomitant illn esses, reactions to concomitant medi cations, 
or progression of disease states .
3.Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse event and must be reported to the clinical 
monitor and to the Sponsor immediately upon learning of the event .
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) –An SAE is any adverse event thatled to any of the following :

investigational medical device.
NOTE 1:to entry: This definition includes adverse even ts resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deploy ment, implantation, installation, or operation, or 
any malfunction of the investigational medical device.
NOTE 2to entry: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.”[ADDRESS_1089198] (UADE) –Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test article, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously  identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, Inve stigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem asso ciated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety 
and welfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events  
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Invest igator will evaluate adverse events to ensure 
the events are categorized correctly. Elements of categorization will include:
xSeriousness/Classifications (see definition in Section 13.1).
xCausality or Relatedness –i.e. the relationship between the test article, study treatment 
or study procedures and the adverse event (not related; unlikely related; possibly
related; related -see definition in Section 13.2.1 ).
xAdverse Event Severity –Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild; moderate; severe for all events -see definition in 
Section 0).
xOutcome –not recovered or not resolved ;recovering or resolving ;recovered or 
resolved with sequelae ;recovered or resolved ;death related to adverse event ;
unknown .
xActions Taken –none; temporarily discontinued; pe rmanently discontinued; other .
13.2.1. Causality Assessment  
Causality Assessment –A determination of the relationship be tween an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]:Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
CR-6392, v3.[ADDRESS_1089199] article, study 
treatment or study procedures .
xUnlikely Related –An adverse event for which an alternative exp lanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomi tant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely .
xPossibly Related –An adverse event that might be due  to the use of the test article, or 
to the stud y treatment or study procedures. An alte rnative explanation, e.g. concomitant 
treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable. Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded .
xRelated –An adverse event that is listed as a possible adve rse effect (device) or adverse 
reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably exp lained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g. 
concomitant treatment of c oncomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very 
suggestive, e.g. it is conf irmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] -challenge and re -challenge .
13.2.2. Severity Assessment  
Severity Assessment –A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_126121]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of test article, study tr eatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:
xMild –Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interf ere 
with the subject’s daily activities .
xModerate –Event is bothersome, possible requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities .
xSevere –Event is intolerable, necessitates additi onal therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities .
13.3. Documentation and Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
The recording and documenting of adverse events (ocular and non -ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test ar ticle, study treatment or study proce dure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the c ondition deteriorates at any time during the study 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the subject’s 
exit from the study will be recorded as adve rse events at the discretion of the Investigator.
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal In vestigator will document the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs. He/she will complete the Adverse Event /eCRF.  
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic re actions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case report form or electronic data system. 
All adverse events occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study  must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship.  Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
CR-6392, v3.0  
Page 69 of 244JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain docu mentation of each reported adverse event. 
All adverse events will be followed in accordan ce with applicable licensing requirements. Such 
documentation will include the following:
xAdverse event (diagnosis not sy mptom) .
xDrawings or photographs (where appropriate) that detail the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.) .
xDate the clinical site was notified .
xDate and time of onset .
xDate and time of resolution .
xAdverse event classification, severity, and relat ionship to test articles, as applicable .
xTreatment regimen instituted, including concomitant medications prescribed, in 
accordance with applicable licensing requirements .
xAny referral to another health care provider if needed .
xOutcome, ocular damage (if an y).
xLikely etiology .
xBest corrected visual acuity at the disc overy of the event and upon conclusion of the 
event .
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he /she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the c orneal lesion will be collec ted to determine if the 
infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, the date of culture collection and 
laboratory utilized will be recorded. 
Changes in the severity of an AE sh all be documented to allow an ass essment of the duration 
of the event at each level of in tensity to be performed. Adve rse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the 
assessment of relationship to the Test Article sha ll also be clearly documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event shall be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre -treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved. If further treatment beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provi der. The Investigator will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study. If 
a subje ct is discontinued from the study, it will be the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation. The Investig ator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoin g adverse 
events related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures, as of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resolution of the adverse event or until referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_18413]. Non -ocular adverse events that are 
not related to the test article, study treatmen t, or study procedures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow -up.
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for any serious /significant Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
CR-6392, v3.0

adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non -significant adverse event. In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_35451]/IRB according to 
their requirements (Section 13.4.2 ). The report will comment whether the adverse event was
considered to be related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures.
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor  
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/significant adverse events occurring 
during t he study period as soon as possible by e -mail, fax, or telephone, but no later than 24 
hours following discovery of the event. The Inves tigator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All 
subjects experiencing a serious/si gnificant adverse event must be  followed up and all outcomes 
must be reported.
When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the randomization code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that t he subject received. The S ponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must:
xNotify the Sponsor immediately .
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who a ssisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject .
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or w as not related to the use of the test article .
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedure according to 
national regulations .
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)
In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Dev ice Effect (UADE), the Investigator 
will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_1089200] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_1089201].
Non-Serious Adverse Events
All non -serious adverse events, including non -serious adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery.
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authori ties 
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
CR-6392, v3.0  
Page 71 of 244JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19582].
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according the 
written guidelines, incl uding reporting timelines. 
13.4.3. Event of Special Interest  
None
13.5. Reporting of Pregnancy  
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270] -report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event. Once  discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study rel ated purposes .Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_126124] d studies for safety concerns, but due to 
general concerns relating to pregna ncy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. Spec ifically, pregnant women are 
discontinued due to fluctu ations in refractive error and/or visual acuity that occur secondary to 
systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the mother or fetus.
14.STATISTICAL METHODS  
14.1. General Considerations  
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_35522]. A 
general description of the statistical methods to be implemented in this clinical trial is outlined 
below.
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS software Version 
9.4 o r higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Throughout th e analysis of data, the results for each 
subject/eye will be used when available for summarization and statistical analysis. 
Unscheduled visits will be summarized se parately and will be excluded from the sta tistical 
analysis.
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or freque ncy tables) will be provided for all baseline 
variables, efficacy variables and safety variable s as appropriate. Continuous variables will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum 
and maximum). Frequency count an d percentage of subjects or eyes within each category will 
be provided for categorical data.
 
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_19586] (Test and Control) and will be perf ormed 
separately by [CONTACT_19587] (Safety Population ,Per-Protocol Population or Intent -to-Treat 
Population ).
14.2. Sample Size Justification  
This study was designed and powered todemonstrate that the binocular high luminance high 
contrast, visual performance (logMAR) of the Test lens at distance (4 meters) is statistically Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.

on the historical data in Table [ADDRESS_1089202] not be ev aluated together in the same clinical stu dy. For each 
replicated sample a linear mixed model was us ed; lens was included as the only fixed effect.  
A variance component (VC) covariance structure was used to model measurements from the 
same subject across study periods. Seventy subjects to complet e provides at least 90% power 
to meet all primary hypotheses (Distance, Int ermediate and Near) associated with visual 
performance.

Comparisons between the Test and Control lenses at the 1 -week follow -up evaluation will be 
carried out using two -sided 95% confid ence intervals constructed for the least -square mean 
difference (Test minus Control).     
Primary hypothesis 1: 
The null and alternative hypothesis for CLUE vision to test for superiority of the Test lens 
relative to the pre -defined threshold of 32 is as follows: 
ܪ௢:ߤ்௘௦௧൑32
ܪ஺:ߤ்௘௦௧൐32
Superiority will be declared  if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of the adjusted 
mean for the Test lens is greater than 32. i.e. P( ߤ்௘௦௧> 32) ≥ 0.975. 
Primary Hypothesis 2:
The null and alternative hypothesis for CLUE vision to test for non -inferiority of the Test lens 
relative the Control lens is as follows: 
ܪ௢:ߤ்௘௦௧െߤ஼௢௡௧௥௢௟൑-5
ܪ஺:ߤ்௘௦௧െߤ஼௢௡௧௥௢௟൐-5
Non-inferiority will be declared if the lower li mit of the 95% confidence interval for the least -
square mean difference is greater than -5. i.e. P(ߤ்௘௦௧െߤ஼௢௡௧௥௢௟ >-5) ≥ 0.975
14.7. Other Exploratory Analyses  
CLUETMcomfort and handling scores will be descriptively summar ized for each timepoint and 
lens type .
Further exploratory analysis may be undertaken  at the discretion of the study responsible 
clinician. 
14.8. Interim Analysis  
There will not be an interim analysis performed on this study.
14.9. Procedure for Handling Missing Data and Drop -Outs  
Missing or spurious values will not be imputed. The count of missing values will be included 
in the summary tables an d listings. Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
CR-6392, v3.[ADDRESS_1089206] clinical trials don’t provide the eviden ce that subject dropout is systematic or not -at-
random. To evaluate the impact of missing data, sen sitivity analysis will be conducted using 
multiple imputation methods if the proportion of s ubject dropout is greater than the 15%. The 
SAS/STAT procedures PROC MI and PROC MIANAL YZE will be utilized with a parametric 
regression method used to make at leas t15imputations .
14.10. Procedure for Reporting Deviations from Statistical Plan  
The analysis will be conducted according to th at specified in above sections. There are no 
known reasons for which it is planned to deviate from these analysis methods. If for any reason 
a change is made, the change will be documented in the study report along with a justification 
for the change.

study intervention will be discontinued, and study follow-up will be conducted as outlined in the protocol.  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the additional risks listed below need to be considered for study participants 
and study personnel:  
Additional Risks Related to  the COVID-19 Pandemic:
xThe possible transmission of the Coronavirus infection and consequent complications, beyond the risk of adverse events due to the investigational device and/or procedures. 
xThe risk may be higher in an optometric clinical study because of the close contact [CONTACT_93950] (since the investigatormust make the measurements close to the subject’s  face) and, in addition the need for multiple 
follow-up visits/exams which may expose the subject to other patients and/or healthcare 
professionals who might be transmitting the virus, even if they do not have symptoms.
xPotential disruptions to the study may be necessary due to current or future pandemic-related 
emergency restrictions, which may lead to delays in scheduled follow-up visits.
xSubjects experiencing an adverse event related to contact [CONTACT_126134]-[ADDRESS_1089223] contracted COVID-19 during participation in a study, he/she will be 
discontinued from the study and followed until COVID-19 Adverse Event (AE) resolution.
To help minimize the above potential risks, JJVCI recommend reviewing/complying with local, state, 
and governmental guidance for COVID-19 risks.

The potential effects of the disease ar e not fully known, at this time, and may include long-term serious health 
consequences. In severe cases, this may result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or death. Based on current knowledge from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), those at  high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include 
older adults and people with underlying medical conditions. 
During this study, all appropriate measures will be taken to minimize risks including the use of personal protective 
equipment such as masks and gloves, as well as proper sanitization.  This is in conformance to guidance from the 
CDC, local health departments, and th e state and county in wh ich the study doctor’s office is located. However, 
these measures may not complete ly eliminate the risks associat ed with contr acting COVID-19. 
If you are found to have contracted COVID-19 or feel ill with flu-like symptoms during participation in the study, 
you will not be permitted to continue in-office study follow-up visits, but you will receive instructions and your 
condition will be monitored by [CONTACT_35586]/or study staff.

time of the day the subject typi[INVESTIGATOR_93810], the number of days per week 
lenses were worn, and the number of consecutive days the subject 
didn’t wear the study lenses, etc.
The discussion with the subject will be documented in EDC under Tele-Visit and a minor protocol deviation 
will be noted. If during the telephone consultation, a subject states he/she wishes to discontinue participating 
in the study, instruct the subject to  stop wearing the study lenses and schedule the subject to return to the 
clinic for a Final Evaluation at the at earliest possible time. Subjects should return all unused lenses to the 
clinic at the last visit.
Changes in study visit schedules, missed visits, or participant discontinuations may lead to missing data, 
including data related to protocol-specified procedures. Case report forms should capture specific 
information regarding the basis of missing data, including the relationship to the COVID-19 pandemic.Clinical Study Protocol

Document Number: Revision Number: [ADDRESS_1089236] DURING PANDEMIC
It is recognized that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have an impact on the conduct 
of this clinical study due to, for example, self-isolation/quarantine by [CONTACT_19611]-site personnel; 
travel restrictions/limited access to public places, in cluding Optometry Clinics; and changes in clinic 
procedures required to address the COVID-19 challenge.  
Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol-specified assessments for study participants, including 
follow-up. However, if scheduled visits cannot be conducted in person at the study site it is suggested that assessments be performed to the extent possible remote ly/virtually or delayed until such time that on-site 
visits can be resumed in order to continue participant monitoring in accordance with the protocol where possible. At each contact, participants will be interviewed to collect safety data. Key efficacy endpoint assessments should be performed if required and as feasible.
Modifications to protocol-required assessments may be permitted via COVID-19 Appendix after consultation with the participant, investigator, and the sponsor. Missed assessments/visits will be captured in the clinical 
trial management system for protocol deviations. Interruptions of test article wear or discontinuations of 
study interventions and withdrawal from the study should be documented with the prefix “COVID-19-
related” in the case report form (CRF).
The sponsor will continue to monitor the conduct and progr ess of the clinical study, and any changes will be 
communicated to the sites and to the health authorities according to local guidance.  
If a participant has tested positive for COVID-19, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_456]’s responsible 
medical monitor to discuss initial plans for study intervention and follow-up. The medical monitor will 
notify the Safety Management Team of any subject(s) that have reported “COVID-19”, “Asymptomatic 
COVID-19”, or “Suspected COVID-19” adverse events within [ADDRESS_1089237] as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will be summarized in the 
clinical study report.  
COVID-19 screening procedures that may be mandated  by [CONTACT_35588].
Monitoring Visits
When on-site monitoring by [CONTACT_19613], the sponsor’s site monitor will contact [CONTACT_19614]. In such cases, on-sit e monitoring visits will resume when feasible, with
increased frequency to address the source data verification backlog.
Even with staffing limitations during this COVID-[ADDRESS_1089238] process. When conditions permit, all parties involved in this clinical trial should communicate relevant information in a timely manner so that 
all relevant parties remain sufficiently informed.

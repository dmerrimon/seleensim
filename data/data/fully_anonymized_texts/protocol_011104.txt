NUMBER OF SITES  Single -site study  
  RATIONALE  Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of adverse health outcomes, including progression to end stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease events, and death. Impaired vitamin D metabolism  is commonly observed  in 
CKD and may contribute  to the  morbidity of this disease .  In 
health y individuals , the kidney produces the majority of 
circulating 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D
3 (1,25(OH) 2D3, or 
calcitriol).  Calcitr iol binds the vitamin D receptor s in diverse 
target tissues  and is known to modulate inflammation and 
fibrosis, suppress the renin -angiotensin system, and regulate 
proliferation and differentiation. In CKD, renal production of 1,25(OH)
2D3 is reduced, resulting in secondary 
hyperparathyroidism and dysregulation of other organs and tissues. Our preliminary data suggest that clearance of vitamin D metabolites is also reduced in CKD. 
The goal of this study is to better understand vitamin D catabolism and how it is affected by [CONTACT_367713]. Specifically, we will evaluate the metabol ic clearance of D6 -
25-hydroxyvitamin D
3 in individuals with varying degrees  of 
CKD and among participants who self -report race as 
Caucasian, African American  or African . The long- term goal 
of this work is to enhance the clinical evaluation and treatment of impaired vitamin D metabolism . 
  STUDY DESIGN This is a single -dose, open- label pharmacokinetic study that 
uses intravenous administration of a stable deuterium -labeled 
25(OH)D 3 to evaluate the metabolic clearance of 25(OH)D 3.  
Allocation : Non-Randomized  
Intervention Model : Single Group Assignment  
Masking : Open Label  
  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE The goal of this study is to better understand vitamin D catabolism and how it is affected by [CONTACT_367713]. Specifically, we will evaluate the metabolic clearance of 25(OH)D

 PLANNED INTERIM 
ANALYSES  This is not a clinical trial with an efficacy outcome, and it is neither randomized nor blinded. For mal interim analyses are

  STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  We will examine the distribution of D6-25(OH)D 3 clearance 
by [CONTACT_8286] (3 categories) and race (2 categories) using box plots and summary statistics. We will test associations of CKD 
status and race with D
6-25(OH)D 3 clearance (continuous 
outcome variable) using linear regression. Models will be 
adjust ed for age, gender, diabetes status, body size, baseline 
25(OH)D concentration, and other covariates strongly related to 25(OH)D
[ADDRESS_459730] whether associations of 
CKD status with clearance are modified by [CONTACT_367715] a 
CKD x race inter action term.    
Rationale for Number of 
Subjects  Our power calculations conservatively assume an interaction between CKD status and race, for which each cell in the 3x2 recruitment grid would require individual comparison. With this approach, we estimate t hat 17 people in each of two 
groups will provide 80% power to detect a difference in D
6-
25(OH)D [ADDRESS_459731] deviation 
of 2 days. We will recruit 20 people per cell to allow for multivariable adjustment.

 1 BACKGROUND  
Among people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), impaired vitamin D metabolism may 
contribute to cardiovascular disease, progression to end stage renal disease, and premature death.
1 In health y individuals , the kidney produces the majority of circulating 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1,25(OH) 2D3, calcitriol), which binds to the vitamin D receptor s in 
diverse target tissues.  Activation of Vitamin D 3 signaling pathways is known to modulate 
inflammation and fibrosis, suppress the renin -angiotensin system, and attenuate secondary 
hype rparathyroidism.  The evaluation and treatment of impaired vitamin D metabolism is a 
major focus of current clinical care for CKD patients however, clinical decision making is 
limited by [CONTACT_367716] 1,25(OH) 2D3 deficiency .  25-
hydroxyvitamin D 3 (25(OH)D 3) is a relatively inactive substrate form of vitamin D; circulating 
1,25(OH) 2D3 concentration is tightly regulated and poorly reflects tissue levels; and circulating 
parathyroid hormone reflects functional 1,25(OH) 2D3 defic iency at only one of many relevant 
biological sites.  
1.1 Overview of Clinical Studies  
Deuterated and tritiated 25(OH)D [ADDRESS_459732] been used previously to study metabolism of vitamin 
D3 in humans .2-6 In addition deuterium is has been used  extensively to study metabolism and is 
considered safe.7 
2 STUDY RATIONALE  
Patients with chron ic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of adverse health outcomes, 
including progression to end stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease events, and death.8 
Impaired vitamin D metabolism is commonly observed in CKD a nd may contribute to the 
morbidity of this disease.1  In healthy individuals, the kidney produces the majority of circulating 
1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1,25(OH) 2D3, or calcitriol).  Calcitrol binds the vitamin D receptors 
in diverse target tissues, and is known to modulate inflammation and fibrosi s, suppress the renin -
angiotensin system, and regulate proliferation and differentiation. In CKD, renal production of 
1,25(OH) 2D3 is reduced, resulting in secondary hyperparathyroidism and dysregulation of other 
organs and tissues. Our preliminary data suggest that clearance of vitamin D metabolites is also reduced in CKD.  
Concentrations of vitamin D metabolites in blood and tissues must necessarily represent a balance of production and catabolism. While basic mechanisms of vitamin D catabolism have been de fined,
9 the clinical evaluation of vitamin D catabolism ha s received remarkably little 
attention. In health, CYP24A1 is the major enzyme responsible for catabolism of both 25(OH)D 3 
and 1,25(OH) 2D3.1,9-[ADDRESS_459733] tissues in the body and is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_256018] 
1,25(OH) 2D3 to prevent 1,25(OH) 2D3 intoxication.16-18 As a result, CYP24A1 expression is 
commonly used as a marker of tissue 1,25(OH) 2D3 activity in basic science.19-[ADDRESS_459734] 1,2 5(OH) 2D3 function has not been similarly harnessed 
for clinical use. Evaluation of circulating 24,25(OH) 2D3 concentration may offer this 
opportunity. 24,25(OH) 2D3 is the most abundant product of 25(OH)D 3 catabolism by 
[CONTACT_097]24A1.9 When viewed in the context of prevailing 25(OH)D 3, 24,25(OH) 2D3 reflects 
CYP24A1 activ ity. 24,25(OH) 2D3 circulates at high concentrations (generally 1 -10 ng/mL)36,37 
and has a circulating half -life of approximately 7 days.38 Circulating 24,25(OH) 2D3 appears to 
Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 2/10/17  Page 10 of 35 
 come from both renal and non- renal sources.15,22,39-41 In the kidney proximal tubule, CYP24A1 
transcription is induced by [CONTACT_9266] -23 and suppressed by [CONTACT_149248].17,42 
To study vitamin D catabolism in humans, we developed a novel high -throughput mass 
spectrometry assay for 24,25(OH) 2D3, measured concurrently with 25(OH)D 3, 25(OH)D 2, 
1,25(OH) 2D3, and 1,25(OH) 2D2.43 We applied this assay to the serum of 278 participants in the 
Seattle Kidney Study (SKS), a single -center cohort study of pre -dialysis CKD .36 Serum 
25(OH)D 3 did not vary by [CONTACT_67889], but mean serum concentrations of 24,25(OH) 2D3 were lower 
with lower eGFR: 3.6, 3.2, 2.6, 2.6, and 1.7 ng/mL for eGFR ≥60, 45- 59, 30- 44, 15- 29, and <15 
mL/min/1.73m2, respectively (p<0.001). These data are consistent with smaller CKD studies that 
observed low circulating concentrations of 24,25(OH) 2D3 measured by [CONTACT_45004]6,44-48 and 
with one study suggesting substantially reduced metabolic clearance of 25(OH)D in ESRD.49 In 
SKS, serum 24,25(OH) 2D3 correlated moderately with 25(OH)D (r2=0.56) but not with 
1,25(OH) 2D (r2<0.01).  
In addition to 24- hydroxylation, 25(OH)D 3 also undergoes hydroxylation at the 4 -position and 
sulfation at the 3- O-position. The  resulting metabolites, 4β,25(OH) 2D3 and 25(OH)D 3-3-sulfate, 
respectively, are generated in the liver by [CONTACT_097]3A450 and SULT2A1 (unpublished results). As 
with CYP24A1, CYP3A4 expression i s induced by 1,25(OH) 2D3.51 In a preliminary analysis of 
plasma from 20 prevalent hemodialysis patients and 14 normal cont rols, we found that the 
relationships of plasma 4β,25(OH) 2D3 and 25(OH)D 3-3-sulfate with plasma 25(OH)D 3 were 
distinctly different for the two populations. Specifically, slopes were less steep in dialysis 
patients, with lower metabolite concentrations at a ny given concentration of 25(OH)D 3. This 
parallels the relationship we previously observed for 24,25(OH) 2D3 and suggests that hepatic 
25(OH)D 3 metabolism is also reduced in CKD. In addition, plasma 25(OH)D 3-3-sulfate 
concentrations were comparable in magni tude to plasma 25(OH)D 3 concentrations, suggesting 
that sulfation may be a quantitatively important unrecognized route of vitamin D catabolism. 
Because 25(OH)D 3-3-sulfate is probably eliminated by [CONTACT_10521], the degree to which 
25(OH)D 3 sulfation is reduc ed in CKD may be underestimated by [CONTACT_367717] 
25(OH)D 3-3-sulfate concentrations.  
Vitamin D metabolism also differs substantially by [CONTACT_545].52 The circulating concentration of 
25(OH) D is substantially lower in people who define their race as African American or African  
compared to Caucasian  populations, presumably due to differences in skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_367709]. Interestingly, the circulating concentrations of 1,25(OH) 2D3 
do not vary by [CONTACT_545], although there are noted differences in bone density between the two 
populations. Data from our cohort suggest associations betwe en low 25(OH)D levels and 
coronary heart disease among Caucasian s, but not in  African American or African  populations. 
This data suggests that previously unrecognized differences in vitamin D catabolism may contribute to racial differences in disease susceptibility.  
The goal of this study is to better understand vitamin D catabolism and how it is affected by [CONTACT_367713]. Specifically, we will evaluate the metabolic clearance of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D3 
in individuals with varying degrees of CKD and among part icipants who self -report their race as  
Caucasian, African American, or African . The long- term goal of this work is to enhance the 
clinical evaluation and treatment of impaired vitamin D metabolism.

 2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
This study will not provide any direct benefit to the study subjects. Individual subjects may have 
a modestly reduced chance of adverse health events because their care will be monitored more closely than it might otherwise. Future patients may benefit from these studies by [CONTACT_367718] D metabolism.  
The risks of administering deuterated 25(OH)D
3 in tracer quantities are low. 25(OH)D 3 is a 
naturally occurring substance and generally circulates in concentrati ons of 10- 50 ng/mL. The 
deuterated 25(OH)D [ADDRESS_459735] ogen atoms with deuterium. This isotope is stable and has metabolic 
and biologic characteristics identical to t he naturally occurring form. We will administer 
quantities intended to make small changes in total circulating 25(OH)D 3 concentration, i.e., an 
increase of 5 ng/mL.  
There is some risk of hypercalcemia with the administration 25(OH)D 3, but this risk is 
minimized by [CONTACT_256042] 25(OH)D > 50 ng/mL and by [CONTACT_367719] 25(OH)D by [CONTACT_131330] 5 ng/mL. We will monitor for 
hypercalcemia during our research. If instances of hypercalcemia are observed, we will change 
our study protocol accordingly to prevent hypercalcemia in future participants. This study also 
includes placement of peripheral intravenous catheters and blood draws. Risks include 
discomfort and minor bleeding associated with catheter placements an d anemia due to blood 
sampling. 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The goal of this study is to better understand vitamin D catabolism and how it is affected by 
[CONTACT_367713]. Specifically, we will evaluate the metabolic clearance of 25 (OH) D3 across stages 
of CKD and among participants who self -report race as Caucasian,  African American or 
African . The long- term goal of this work is to enhance the clinical evaluation and treatment of 
impaired vitamin D metabolism . 
3.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To explore the biochemical pathways through which 25(OH)D 3 is metabolized, and the 
effects of CKD and race on these pathways, by [CONTACT_367720] 25(OH)D 3.  
• To determine clinical and biochemical factors that are correl ated with the metabolic 
clearance of 25(OH)D 3. 
• To evaluate potential biomarkers of 25(OH)D 3 
4 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a cross- sectional, observational study that uses the intravenous administration of stable 
isotope -labeled D 6-25(OH)D 3 to evaluate the metabolic  clearance of 25(OH)D 3. It is a single -
dose, open- label PK study of 25(OH)D 3. 
Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 2/10/17  Page 12 of 35 
 We will recruit a total of up to 120 study subjects, with recruitment stratified by [CONTACT_367721]. Subjects who provide written informed consent and qualify at screening wi ll receive a 
single dose of intravenous labeled 25(OH)D 3. Subsequent blood draws and urine collections will 
be used to determine the metabolic clearance of 25(OH)D [ADDRESS_459736] is the metabolic clearance of labeled 25(OH)D 3.  
We will measure serum concentrations of  24,25(OH) 2D3, 25(OH)D 3, 25(OH)D 2, 1,25(OH) 2D3 
and 1,25(OH) 2D2 at the University of Washington by [CONTACT_256044], a single serum aliquot is used to measure this panel of vitamin D metabolites using by [CONTACT_256045] -mass spectrometry (Xevo TQ, Waters Corp., 
Milford, MA) with deuterated internal standards.
53-[ADDRESS_459737], non -compartmental analysis of plasma concentration versus time data will be 
performed using Phoenix software (Pha rsight, Cary, NC). Clearance will be calculated as 
administered 25(OH)D 3 dose divided by 25(OH)D 3 AUC. We focus on clearance as our primary 
outcome because it reflects the metabolism of 25(OH)D 3 accounting for circulating 25(OH)D 3 
concentration (units of v olume/time, akin to creatinine clearance). Clearance is independent of 
volume of distribution, in contrast to t 1/2, which will be evaluated as a secondary outcome. 
Clearance will be evaluated with and without adjustment for body size .   
5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
• AUC of labeled D 6-25(OH)D 3  
• Terminal half -life of labeled D 6-25(OH)D 3 
• Volume of distribution in the central compartment of labeled D 6-25(OH)D 3 
• Metabolic formation clearance (metabolite/parent AUC ratio) for metabolites of labeled D 6-
25(OH)D 3 
5.3 Safety Evaluations  
An abnormal clinical laboratory value will be documented as an adverse event if one of the following applies:  
• The abnormality is not contradicted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality. 
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or orga n toxicity.  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management ( e.g., requires a medication 
change, more frequent follow -up, or further diagnostic evaluation).  
Change in clinical laboratory findings (if there are specific labs, then why they are appropriate to measure, e.g. , BUN or Creatinine for an aminoglycoside)  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 2/10/17  Page 13 of 35 
 • results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to add itional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant dis ability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
Important medical events are those that do not fit the other definitions of serious adverse events, 
but the event may jeopardize the patient and may require treatment to prevent one of the listed serious adverse events.  
Adverse events will be reported if they occur between the time of informed consent and [ADDRESS_459738] each participant to report any subsequent event that the participant, or participant’s personal physician, reasonably believe s may be related to the 
study. The investigator will notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring 
after the participant has discontinued participation if the event can be reasonably related to the 
study.

Protocol  Number: CLEAR -01 Confidential  
 
Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 2/10/[ADDRESS_459742] and Control Products  
We will administer labeled D 6-25(OH)D 3 Solution for Injection, 20 µg/mL intravenously. D 6-
25(OH)  D3 Solution for Injection, 20 µg/mL  has been manufactured according to current  Good 
Manufacturing Practices  by [CONTACT_256049] ( Palo Alto, CA ). 
8.3.[ADDRESS_459743]  
The labeled D6-25(OH)D 3 Solution for Injection, 20 µg/mL prepared by [CONTACT_367725].  Each mL contains 20 µg D 6-25(OH) D3, 60% 
propylene glycol (60%), 10% ethanol (ETOH) and water (30%) for injection, to volume .   
8.3.[ADDRESS_459744] has been  aliquoted into single -use vials by [CONTACT_256051] <60°C for storage. Vial labels include the drug product name, concentration, batch 
number, manufacture date, and storage conditions, similar to the draft label shown below. 
 
8.4 Supply of Study Drug  at the Site  
Single -use vials will be stored at <60°C at the University of Washington Investigational Drug 
Services or Kidney Research Institute. Individual doses of D 6-25(OH)  D3 Solution for Injection 
will be prepared for intravenous administration  by [CONTACT_256052] a syringe . The prepared dose 
of will be calculated according to estimated blood volume  based on body weight . The prepared 
dosing syringe will be labeled with the participant’s full name, date of birth, and medical record 
number along with the drug contents. Once thawed, the drug product will be infused within eight 
hours of preparation.  
8.4.1 Dosage/Dosage Regimen  
Each participant will receive a singl e intravenous dose of D 6-25(OH)  D3 Solution for Injection, 
20 µg/mL . We will use estimated blood volume based on body weight to achieve a target 
concentration of  5 ng/mL  D6-25(OH)  D3. The target of 5 ng/mL was selected because it will 
allow precise tracking of circulating deuterated D6-25(OH)  D3concentration throughout follow -
up (based on known limits of detection for our assay) without substantially perturbing underlying vitamin D status.  Theoretically, the dose require d to achieve a 5 ng/mL increment in deuterated 
25(OH)D
3 concentration  can be calculated as the targeted peak  concentration multiplied by [CONTACT_256053], which for 25(OH)D 3 is expected to be equal to blood volume . We will 
use the formula of Nadler et al ( 1962)  to estimate blood volume for each participant . We will 
begin the study by [CONTACT_256054] a dose of 5 ng/mL x estimated blood

achieved D 6-25(OH)  D3 concentrations throughout the course of the study . If our initial 
approach fails to achieve peak D 6-25(OH)  D3 concentrations near 5 ng/mL, we will  revise our 
approach for future participants , as indicated. For example, if mean peak achieved 25(OH)D 3 
concentrations are near 2.5 ng/mL  with our initial approach , we will increase our dose by a factor 
of two. We will not exceed a dose of 100 µg (5 mL)  D6-25(OH) D3  for any participant.

11 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that d evelops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
11.1.1  AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse E vents  (CTCAE) 
Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the guidelines shown in Table 11.1  below 
should be used to grade severity.  It should be poi nted out that the term “severe” is a measure of 
intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
Table  11.1  AE Severity Grading  
Severity 
(Toxicity 
Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention or 
therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it 
reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical intervention/therapy 
required.  
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threaten ing 
(4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypotheticall y might have caused death if it 
were more severe.

Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 2/10/17  Page 22 of 35 
 11.1.2  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the guidelines 
in Table 11. 2. 
Table  11.2  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship 
to Drug  Comment  
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_41833]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846].  
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; 
that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_191682] n characteristics of the subject’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_41847].  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; 
that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug.  
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that re sults in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse experience  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event

Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 2/10/[ADDRESS_459752] each participant to report any subsequent event that 
the participant, or participant’s personal physician, reasonably believes may be related to the 
study. The investigator will notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring 
after the participant has discontinued participation if the event can be reasonably related to the 
study.  
11.3 Abnormal lab values  
An abnormal clinical laboratory value will be documented as an adverse event if one of the 
following applies:  
1. The abnormality is not contradicted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality. 
2. The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity.  
3. The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management (e.g ., requires  a 
medication change, more frequent follow -up, or further diagnostic evaluation).  
 
11.4 Hosp italization, Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342043] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery will be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event. Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
1. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
2. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
3. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or  increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49849].

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Data Sets Analyzed  
All participants who receive the study drug ( D6-25(OH) D3 Solution for Injection) will be 
included in the safety analysis.    
14.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
The foll owing demographic variables at screening will be summarized by [CONTACT_367722]: 
age, gender, medical comorbidities, medications used, height, weight, body mass index, 
laboratory values (including calcium, phosphorus, albumin, vitamin D binding protein, 
parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor -23), and adiposity measured by [CONTACT_11324] .   
14.3 Analysis of Primary  Endpoint  
We will examine the distribution of D6-25(OH) D3 clearance by [CONTACT_8286] (3 categories) and 
race (2 categories) using box plots and summary sta tistics. We will explore the distribution of 
D6-25(OH) D3 clearance by [CONTACT_367726] (age, gender, diabetes status, and baseline 
concentrations of 25(OH)D, PTH, FGF -23, and vitamin D binding protein) using locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS), c ubic splines, and box plots. We will pay particular 
attention to the associations of PTH and FGF -23 with D 6-25(OH) D3 clearance, including 
multivariable modeling to determine independent associations. We will test associations of CKD status and race with D
6-25(OH) D3 clearance (continuous outcome variable) using linear 
regression. Models will be adjusted for age, gender, diabetes status, vitamin D supplement use 
(within eligibility criteria), body size, baseline 25(OH)D concentration, and other covariates 
strongly related to D6-25(OH) D3  clearance. We will test whether associations of CKD status 
with clearance are modified by [CONTACT_367715] a CKD x race interaction term. If we find evidence of interaction, we will analyze each CKD x race category separately . Absent

Version #: 2.1 Version Date: 2/10/[ADDRESS_459756] associations of each exposure in parallel (adjusted for each other) to 
maximize precision and power. 
14.4 Analysis of S econdary  Endpoints  
Analyses of secondary endpoints will parallel those of the primary endpoint. 
14.5 Interim Ana lysis 
This is not a clinical trial with an efficacy outcome, and it is neither randomized nor blinded. No 
formal interim analyses are planned.  
14.6 Sample Size and Randomization  
Our power calculations conservatively assume an interaction between CKD status and race, for which each cell in the 3x2 recruitment grid would require individual comparison. With this approach, we estimate that 17 people in each of two groups will provide 80% power to detect a 
difference in D
6-25(OH) D3 half-life of [ADDRESS_459757]’s  visit 
into the  protocol -specific electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF)  when the information 
corresponding to that visit is available.  Subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_92293] (or designee), but will be identified by a subject number.

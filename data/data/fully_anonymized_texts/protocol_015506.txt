Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional resear ch policies and 
procedures. 
 
Background 
This proposal focuses on the novel use of high- intensity interval training (HIIT) as a method to improve 
physical function in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA).  
 
Knee OA is one of the top five causes  of disability in the [LOCATION_002] .1 The estimated lifetime risk of  
symptomatic knee OA is nearly 45% by 85 years of age, and this risk grows to 60% among those who are obese.
2 Physical activity reduces pain and increases physical function in people with knee OA and i s a mainstay 
for treatment of OA .3-7 The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines support ≥150 
minutes of moderate- to-vigorous physical activity per week for improved health and weight management,8, 9 but 
less than 10% of adults and few people with symptomatic knee OA achieve these recommended levels.10, 11  
Lack of time and motivation are common reasons for not mainta ining regular physical activity.12  Furthermore, 
many people with OA are unable to complete the DHHS recommended duration of moderate intensity aerobic exercise because of pain levels or functional limitations. Given the current high rates of inactivity in symptomatic knee OA patients, novel approaches are needed to help individuals achieve physical activity levels that will result in reduced disability.

High -intensity interval training (HIIT) is a time -efficient exercise strategy in which short intense exercise 
periods are interspersed with recovery periods. HIIT requires as little as 10 minutes of exercise per session and 
results in improved health and physical function, often in as few as 2 weeks.13 This form of exercise requires 
less frequent and shorter duration exercise (e.g., 2 times per week for 10 minutes) than either traditional long duration low- moderate intensity exercise or high intensity resistance (strength) training. HIIT is safe in a variety 
of clinical populations including patients with heart failure,
[ADDRESS_102572], and maximize comfort. 
Recently, the need for more data on higher intensity exercise in OA patients has been highlighted.18 To date, 
research examini ng HIIT among people with OA is sparse, with only 1 previous study showing benefits of a 6- 
week combined aquatic treadmill walking and balance program on joint pain, balance and function.19 Longer 
term data are needed on a HIIT program tailored to a patient’s access to and comfort with exercise equipment. Our pre liminary evidence
20, [ADDRESS_102573] periods (which may be more feasible for people with knee OA), yet results in comparable or greater benefits to traditional, continuous moderate intensity exercise.
22, [ADDRESS_102574] a HIIT intervention for people with knee OA (40-75 years old) and obtain preliminary data on changes in outcomes during and after HIIT. A protocol 
previously evaluated by [CONTACT_92761] 2 times per week for 12 weeks. An acute evaluation (week 6) will occur to better understand the feasibility of the intervention in 30 participants with symptomatic knee OA for the primary outcomes of 
performance -based physical function and knee OA symptomatic burden (pain), along with secondary outcomes 
of balance, isometric knee extensor and flexor strength (factors associated with physical function and symptomatic knee OA progression), cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863], and body composition.  Aim 1.  To examine the feasibility and acceptability of the HIIT program in patients with knee OA symptoms 
ranging from  mild to severe. We will determine adherence to and tolerability of HIIT, acceptability, and 
recruitment and retention rates of patients through 6- and 12- week assessments.  
 Aim 2.  To determine short -term changes in outcomes among patients with symptomatic  knee OA participating 
in a HIIT intervention. Hypothesis: Patients with knee OA will have clinically important improvements in physical function, knee OA symptomatic burden (pain), balance, isometric knee extensor and flexor strength, cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_92734], and body composition after completing HIIT for [ADDRESS_102575] is a single -arm feasibility and proof- of-concept study in which all participants will receive 12 
weeks of HIIT. All patients will underg o a series of baseline (week 0), mid - (week 6), and post-intervention 
(week 12 ) evaluations, as described below. Baseline values for all measures will be collected within the 10 days 
prior to initiation of the intervention. Testing will occur at 6 weeks (± 5 days) and 12 weeks (± 5 days). Testing at 6 weeks is included due to the rapid results often reported after as little as 2 weeks of HIIT. This testing point will more fully inform the development of a larger scale trial and the appropriate duration of H IIT for a knee 
OA population, as well as allow for modification of intensity to maintain sufficient training intensity.  All

 Tolerability, Feasibility, Compliance and Adherence (Aim 1).  We will determine the percent of participants that 
screen into the study versus those approached and the percent of participants retained at the 6- and 12- week 
post-tests. Frequency and reasons for initial refusal, ineligibility, and drop out will be collected. Adherence and tolerability will be evaluated based on number of sessions attended/completed, modifications, such as change in mode; number of training days per week; recovery days needed between sessions to complete training, and severity of pain on a scale of 0 -10 (no pain- extreme pain) during and after exercise as a measure of tolerability. 
The physical activity enjoyment scale
28 will be given to assess participant enjoyment of exercise on each 
training day.  Outcomes (Aim 2).  Because HIIT in people with knee OA is novel, a set of functional, symptomatic, and 
physiological variables will be included as outcomes. These outcomes will allow for the monitoring of initial changes related to the intervention and to identify the most appropriate measures for inclusion in a larger trial.  Physical Function will be measured with performa nce based tests: [ADDRESS_102577]. All physical function tests are in accordance with the 
Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommendations.
29, 30 
 Knee OA Symptomatic Burden. Participants will be asked to complete the Knee Injury an d Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (KOOS).  The KOOS questionnaire was developed to assess the patient’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_92735]. It is widely used for research purposes in clinical trials of knee OA, and its psychometric properti es have been confirmed .
31-33 The KOOS is available online for free use. An advantage of 
the KOOS is that it includes the Western Ontario & McMaster Universities  Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). 
The WOMAC, a measure of lower extremity pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and function (17 items), will be used to measure o verall symptomatic burden of OA.
34 All items are rated on a Likert scale of 0 (no symptoms) 
to 4 (extreme symptoms). The reliability and validity of the WOMAC total score and subscales have been confirmed,

Muscle Strength. A Humac isokinetic dynamometer will be used to measure isokinetic power and isometric 
strength of knee flexors and extensors.37, 38 Measures will be assessed according to manufacturer’s instructions, 
with the primary assessment of power at 60 degrees per second and for strength at 60 degrees of knee flexion. These selections are based on clinical relevance and that persons with OA exh ibit high correlations (r>0.7) for 
assessments of power at varying speeds and of isometric strength at varying angles.
39 
 Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863], measured by [CONTACT_92762] (VO2peak), is the gold standard for identifying fitness level and evaluating cardiovascular effects. This test will be used to establish individual training intensity. All participants will perform a ramp based cycling ergometer test with respi[INVESTIGATOR_92736]-circuit spi[INVESTIGATOR_92737] a calibrated metabolic cart (True One 2400®, Parvo -Medics, Inc., Provo, UT). Data will be averaged over 15-second intervals, with the highest 15-second 
oxygen  consumption, minute ventilation and heart rate recorded as the peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), 
time to  exhaustion, and maximum heart rate, respectively. In accordance with the Exercise and Sport Science 
Institutional Review Board Standard Operating Procedures ( EXSS -IRB SOP ), following a 12 lead 
electrocardiogram ( EKG ) cleared by a study physician, 3 trained research personnel (for safety purposes per 
IRB procedures) will perform cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_92738].  
 Body composition will be assessed to evaluate the effects of HIIT on fat mass, lean body mass, and visceral  
fat. Previous data demonstrated positive effects of HIIT on fat mass, visceral fat, and, more importantly for this OA po pulation, lean mass. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; GE Lunar iDXA, Software version 16, 
Chicago IL) will be used to determine whole-body fat mass, lean mass, bone mineral density, and segmental (arms, legs) body composition. Each scan will be performed by [CONTACT_92763], and  
previous data from this lab indicate high test- retest reliability for fat mass (intraclass correlation coefficient  
[ICC]=0.98, standard error of measurement [SEM]=0.85 kg), and lean mass (ICC=0.99, SEM=1.07 kg ). In 
accordance with the EXSS -IRB SOP, personnel trained with radiation exposure training will complete the DXA 
scans.  
 
HIIT Intervention:  All training will be performed in the Applied Physiology Laboratory or Campus Recreation 
Center on the UNC campus, with one-on-one supervision from trained research personnel, 2 times per week for 12 weeks.
21 Details are described below and in Figure 3.  
 
• Type: Mode of exercise will vary based on participant limitations and choice, including activities such as 
walking, biking, elliptical machine, and swimming, with individual mode being consistently maintained whenever possible throughout the duration of the study. Cycling will be suggested as the primary mode, but another mode will be selected if cycling is not feasible. If limitations arise for the participant during familiarization and throughout the study (i.e. discomfort, inability to increase heart rat e), training mode will 
be modified, and noted, to inform feasibility components (Aim 1).   
• Intensity: Individualized training intensity for each participant will be established from baseline cardiovascular fitness (VO2peak) testing. Baseline maximal oxygen  consumption testing and maximum 
workload will be used to determine the intensity of each exercise bout (90% of maximum heart rate obtained during testing).  
 
• Session: Each training session will consist of a [ADDRESS_102579] low levels of physical activity at baseline. Individuals who are

intervention program for inclusion and development of a home-based component for future trials.

Page  | [ADDRESS_102582] 9 months of enrollment for a previous study, “Physical Therapy vs. 
Internet- Based Exercise Training for Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis” (PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Allen, co -I Dr. G olightly),[ADDRESS_102583] been enrolled in the UNC area, surrounding communities, and Smithfield, North Carolina using inclusion/exclusion criteria and methods similar to the current study  (total needed 350). In a 
similar manner to that study, patients will be initially identified from UNC medical records based on ICD -10 
codes; individuals who mee t initial eligibility criteria based on the medical record will be mailed introductory 
letters. Additionally, flyers and brochures will be posted at UNC and the surrounding community, and UNC healthcare providers in rheumatology, orthopedics, primary care, and physical therapy will provide brochures to patients. Individuals interested in the study will be screened for eligibility criteria via telephone. Individuals who meet eligibility criteria and are interested in participating will meet a study team memb er to complete 
informed consent and inclusion criteria. All potential patients will undergo a 12- lead electrocardiogram and will 
be cleared to participate following medical history review from Drs. Viera and Nelson. Following clearance, baseline testing will occur.  
 
We will enroll patients who have sought care for knee osteoarthritis from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), a large not -for-profit healthcare system that provides both primary and specialty care. Over 
800,000 people receive outpatient care at UNC clinics annually. Based on the patient populations in our enrollment site and experience from our previous studies, there will be an ample number of patients eligible for the proposed study. Our estimate of potentially eligible patie nts at UNC is based on the number of outpatients 
age 55, n=119,517, and the prevalence of symptomatic knee OA in this age group (about 12%). Based on these numbers, we estimate there will be a total of over 14,000 patients with knee OA at UNC. Given this l arge 
number, we will be able to focus recruitment on patients who live within reasonable driving distance to study enrollment sites and physical therapy clinics (which still encompasses a range of geographic regions  in terms of 
urban/rural status).  Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
The sample in the current study will be comprised of approximately 50% women. The University of North Carolina community is comprised of 58.1% of females as reported by [CONTACT_941] U.S. News and World Report in 2015. Knee osteoarthritis is highly prevalent among both men and women, and women have a higher risk of knee osteoarthritis than men. Therefore, we do not anticipate problems recruiting women into the proposed study.  
 All races and sexes will be included in the current study. The racial/ethnic composition of the current study is  
expected to be representative of the diversity of the [LOCATION_002] and greatly reflect the composition of the Chapel Hill, North Carolina area. According to the 2010 Census Bureau, the Chapel Hill, North C arolina area is  
comprised of 72.76% white, 9.66% African American, 0.31% Native American, 11.86% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, while 2.68% are considered other and 2.70% consider themselves as two or more races. There was 
Page  | 15 
 
6.36% of the population that was considered Hispanic or Latino. We will recruit minority races/ ethnicities  
aggressively to ensure the study sample is representative of the general population (See Targeted/ Planned 
Enrollment Table).

Participant Retention Plan  
All relevant members of the research team will be responsible for participant retention. The following section 
details the procedures for participant  retention , which will be carried out by [CONTACT_19908], the Study 
Coordinator and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_92752].   Role of the Research Assistant, Study Coordinator and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_92753], Study Coordinator and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_92754] 1) informing the research team of appropriate recruiting and 
retention procedures 2) determining the success of current strategies to recruit and retain study participants, and 3) evaluating and improving participant  recruitment and retention strategies throughout the duration of the 
study. The following major principles will be implemented throughout the study in order to maximize participant  retention. 
 
Retention: Role of All Study Personnel All members of the study team will be responsible for ensuring participant retention throughout the duration of the study. [CONTACT_92788] will manage participant recruitment, with the assistance of Betsy Hackney, and communicate with study physicians about safety considerations during enrollment and the intervention. Kelli Allen, who conducts research in knee OA individuals, will advise on strategies for recruitment and retention.  
 Monthly meetings of the Research Team will be coordinated by [CONTACT_92765].  Monthly meetings will ensure that the described aims are completed in a timely fashion and that the overall direction of the project is guided by [CONTACT_92766]. [CONTACT_92788] will lead monthly meetings of the research team and [CONTACT_92792]  | 16 
 
Smith -Ryan will be responsibl e for organizing, scheduling and facilitating the meetings. The meetings will 
provide an opportunity to discuss recent progress, scientific design, data interpretation and future directions. 
Inclusion of additional members at the monthly meetings (for advi ce and scientific expertise) will be agreed 
upon by [CONTACT_92767]. Golightly and [CONTACT_84135]-Ryan. Drs. Golightly and Smith- Ryan currently have weekly  
communications, providing a foundation for timely interaction and trouble-shooting of issues that may arise.   [CONTACT_84135] -Ryan will manage the training of the laboratory team with the HIIT protocol and laboratory testing, 
provide checks to confirm protocol and testing fidelity, and oversee the one-on-one HIIT instruction. [CONTACT_84135]-Ryan will hold bi- monthly meetings w ith the laboratory team  in which scientific and project issues will be 
discussed. All members of the research team will be made aware that retention efforts begin with participant recruitment, and informed consent is an ongoing process throughout the entire duration of the study. During each meeting all members of the research team will be reminded to address all study participants with congeniality, respectfulness and friendliness during each interaction with a participant or potential participant. Additio nally, all members of the research team will be asked to ensure all questions from the study participants 
and family members of the study participants are completely answered throughout each interaction with study participants.   Three participants per month are expected to be enrolled with at least 80% retention during the study period. As part of Aim 1, adherence to and tolerability of HIIT, acceptability, and recruitment and retention rates of patients through 6- and 12- week ass essments will be determined. This will be determined as the percent of 
participants that screen into the study versus those approached and the percent of participants retained at the 6- and 12-week post-tests. Frequency and reasons for initial refusal, ineligibility, and drop out will be collected. Adherence and tolerability will be evaluated based on number of sessions attended/completed, modifications, such as change in mode; number of training days per week; recovery days needed between sessions to complete training, and severity of pain on a scale of 0-10 (no pain- extreme pain) during and after exercise as a measure of 
tolerability.  If the HIIT intervention is shown to be well- tolerated and promising, results of this preliminary 
study will lay the fou ndation for a large randomized controlled trial to establish the efficacy of HIIT as a 
revolutionary approach for enhancing the rehabilitation and management of knee OA. 
 
Enhancing Participants Understanding of the Study During the initial meeting with a potential study participant the Research Assistant or Study Coordinator will be responsible for describing all aspects of the study in detail in order to ensure the participant completely understands the scope of the study and what will be required of each participant. The Research Assistant will provide the participant with a copy of the informed consent form, and will talk through each component with the participant. The participant will be able to ask any questions necessary in order to ensure the participant is informed about the purpose of the study and what he/she will be asked to complete. Additionally, study participants will be made aware they have an active role in the research study and are a valuable part of the research team. Throughout the cours e of the study all participants will have the opportunity to meet directly 
with the Research Assistant, Study Coordinator or Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_92755].  All clinical and functional assessments w ill be described and demonstrated before the participant is asked to 
complete them; participants may choose not to engage in a particular assessment if they anticipate it will not be tolerable, and they may ask to stop an assessment at any time.

Identifying Potential Problems The Principal Investigator s, with th e assistance and advice of Research Assistants and Co -Investigators, will be 
responsible for monitoring participant recruitment and retention throughout the duration of the research study. The Principal Investigator s will assess recruitment rates and retention rates each month and determine any 
potential problems. The Principal Investigator s and Co -Investigators will also determine key retention factors 
that should be emphasized in order to maximize participant retention throughout the duration of the study. In the event retention issues arise throughout the study the Principal Investigators, with advice from Co -Investi gators,  
will develop new intervention strategies to maximize participant retention and revise the MOOP as necessary. Drs. Golightly and Smith -Ryan currently have weekly communications, providing a foundation for timely 
interaction and trouble-shooting of issues that may arise. Problems requiring immediate attention of the research lab team will be communicated  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Smith -Ryan.   
 
Monetary Compensation Participants will be paid to help compensate for their time and travel. Participants will receive a  total of $ 100.

study participation by [CONTACT_13172] (via initial letter and telephone call) all participant s who meet inclusion / 
exclusion criteria, regardless of demographic characteristics.  We have also aimed to produce recruitment and intervention materials that are appropriate for individuals with low literacy or education levels.  We will continue to recruit participant s until we re ach our sample size goal of N=30. 
 Interactions with participants during the recruitment process will include both telephone and in -person 
interaction. When study teams are speaking with participants via telephone (e.g., recruitment/screening call or when participants call to self -refer for the study), this will be done in a private location. In-person baseline 
visits, which w ill include giving information about the study so participants can decide whether to participate, 
will also be conducted in private locations.  The list of potential study participants, based on medical record review, will be transferred into a secure 
computerized tracking database.  Likewise, participant  data for all participant s enrolled in the study will be 
entered into a secure computerized enrollment log.  These data will be accessible only to study personnel needing access to fulfill their study related duties.

Informed Consent and HIPPA  
 
Informed Consent Process  
Prior to performing any study related activities, potential participants will provide written informed consent. A qualified professional on the research team will inform each potential participant of the purpose of the project, possible risks, their personal rights, and potential benefits of the study. All possible exclusion criteri a will be 
verified following informed consent, prior to screening. The informed consent form clearly states the rights of a participant, including the telephone number and email address for the Committee on the Rights of Human Subjects of the UNC School of Medicine. This office may be contact[CONTACT_92769]. The informed consent forms are written in large print at a level understandable to the participants. For low-literacy participants, the consent form will be read aloud v erbatim. The interviewers are highly experienced 
and have successfully completed ethics training.  Participant s will only be included if they have the capacity to 
give legally effective consent.  We will not include participants who lack decision making capacity, so consent 
from legally  authorized representatives will not be required. The original signed consent forms will be kept in a 
separate folder from the individual study folder. This folder will be stored in a locked file cabinet of the Applied Physiolo gy Laboratory. Participants will be provided with a copy of the conse nt form for personal reference.  
Informed Consent Form  
See Appendix A.1 for Approved Consent form  
Page  | [ADDRESS_102588] the rights, safety, and welfare of human participant s involved in research studies.  
We will attempt to minimize the collection, storage, and transmission of information containing participant s’ 
personal identifiers, and, whenever identifiers are necessary, protect against unauthorized access or disclosure.  In addition, we will employ several rigorous procedures for protecting against risks to participant  privacy and 
confidentiality of data.  We will only collect and store information about study participant s that is relevant to 
the research as outlined in the protocol.  We will minimize the use of paper documents by [CONTACT_92770]. All study databases will be password prote cted and only 
study team members whose job functions require access to these data will have permissions. Whenever possible, data will not be stored on laptop computers. Individual participant  data will not be shared with 
individuals outside the study team, except as required by [CONTACT_92771]/or for regulatory purposes.    All study staff must regularly fulfill certification requirements in Human Subjects Protection training.  Study personnel are also regularly trained in stringent computer and information security procedures.  All electronic study data will be stored electronically on secure UNC servers, accessible only to study personnel.  Research study records will be maintained for no less than 7 years following the completion of the study, after which time personal identifying informa tion will be removed.  Research information in a participant’s medical 
record will  be kept indefinitely. 
Participant  Evaluations and Follow-up  
 
Timeline and Visit Schedule  
The current study consists of 27 total visits: [ADDRESS_102589] at 
the Applied Physiology Laboratory and/or the Student Recreation Center.  The three testing  visits will consist of 
assessments of physical function, cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863], body composition, balance, symptoms, and muscular strength. These visits will occur at baseline, 6 -weeks, and 12 weeks.   The HIIT intervention will occur over the 
course of 24 separate training sessions, occurring two times per week for two 6- week sessions.

Concomitant Medications  
  
Use and changes of medications for OA will be monitored and recorded during the study but will not be a reason for exclusion. Subjects will be asked to self- report a ll medications that they are  currently using and/or being prescribed 
during the 7 days prior to study enrollment at the baseline visit.   At subsequent study visits, participants will be asked 
Page  | 22 
 
to report any changes with their medications (e.g., discontinuation, new medications). Medications will be considered 
when conduc ting analyses and interpreting results.  
 
Statistical Considerations  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_102592], the flow of participants through the study (i.e., screened, recruitment, enrollment [along with 
refusals and ineligibility, with reasons] , and follow- up at each time point) will be descriptively summarized  
using frequencies and proportions. Then, compliance and tolerability of HIIT (i.e., proportion of sessions completed, change in mode, number of training days per week, recovery days between sessions), along with 95% confidence intervals, will be summarized. We will also descriptively summarize pain on a 0 -10 scale, 
during and after exercise, as well as participant enjoyment of exercise by [CONTACT_92772], and will use informative graphical approaches where useful.   
Aim 2 Analyses  
All available data from all enrolled participants, regardless of extent of adherence to HIIT, will be descriptively 
summarized in tables and graphs.  Longitudinal models will be fit for all outcomes  (physical function, knee OA 
symptomatic burden, balance, muscle strength, cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863], and body composition) using all available data wi th linear mixed models.  Mixed models allow for inclusion of all observed outcome data for 
each participant under the assumption that any missing data are missing at random.  No missing data will be imputed. Separate models will be fit for each outcome wit h no adjustments for multiple comparisons since this 
is an exploratory proof- of-concept study; however, data from all outcomes assessed will be reported regardless 
of “significance”.  For each model, fixed effects will include visit, gender, baseline BMI, age , and severity of 
baseline OA symptoms. Additionally, if at least 10%  of participants are not using prescribed pain medications at 
each time point, we will include dichotomous use of pain medication as a time-dependent fixed effect. Each model will also  include random participant effects to account for correlation between repeated outcome 
measurements.  For each outcome, we will use the model to estimate the mean change from baseline to each follow-up visit along with 95% confidence intervals.  
Power and  Sample Size.  
For this study, we chose the [ADDRESS_102593] deviation for walk 
times is 10 seconds, based on results from a study among patients with knee OA;[ADDRESS_102594] deviation was 9.2 seconds, and we computed an upper 80% confidence bound of [ADDRESS_102595] 10%, and that correlation between r epeated outcomes 
from the same participant would be at least 0.6 (a conservative value).  Under these assumptions, enrolling [ADDRESS_102596] 80% power to detect a mean 5-second diffe rence between baseline and the 
12-week assessment u sing a two -sided test at the 5% level.  
 
Analyses of Safety Data and OA Medications  
Any accumulated data on adverse events, particularly those adjudicated to be at least potentially related to HIIT, 
will be descriptively reported using frequencies and proportions. Additionally, medications prescribed for the treatment of OA will be descriptively summarized, along with changes in these medications over the course of the study. No inferential statistics will be presented for safety or medication data.

Safety Reporting Overview  
 
Definitions  
Adverse events will be determined using the NC TraCS Safety Monitoring Plan guidelines for Minimal Risk Studies. 
The Grading Scale is as follows:  
 
 Mild  - Event results in mild or transient discomfort, not requiring intervention or treatment; does not interfere with 
daily activities (e.g. transient muscle soreness)  
 
 Moderate - Event is sufficiently discomforting so as to limit or interfere with daily activities; may require additional interventional treatment (e.g. mus culoskeletal injury such as a muscle strain)  
 
 Severe - Event results in significant symptoms that prevent normal daily activities; may require invasive 
intervention 
 
In the event that two adverse events are classified as either moderate or severe the study  will be placed on hold in order 
to reassess the study procedures in order to decrease the risk of another adverse event. Based on previous data, the potential for adverse events are minimal. The potential benefits outweigh potential musculoskeletal and ca rdiovascular 
risks.  
 
Monitoring Roles 
[CONTACT_92788] (Lead PI) and [CONTACT_84135]-Ryan (PI) will oversee data collection monitoring and all issues related to 
participant safety data collection protocols, and participant confidentiality.  [CONTACT_84135] -Ryan will oversee the training of 
lab team members and monitor training sessions.  Lab team members who become aware of any adverse event or 
unanticipated problems related to the study will notify [CONTACT_84135] -Ryan immediately.  
 
[CONTACT_92787], a physician who specializes in cardiovascular disease will advise on cardiovascular safety and approve participation of each participant.   [CONTACT_92793] (rheumatologist, epi[INVESTIGATOR_47561]), an expert in knee OA management, will advise on clinical and safety consi derations relevant to OA . 
 
The Institutional Review Board (IRB)  is a committee  established by [CONTACT_92773]/sponsoring institution to review and 
approve research involving human subjects. The IRB ensures human subject research is conducted in accordance with 
all federal, institutional, and ethical guidelines.  
 Based on previous experience with HIIT and knee OA patients, i t is not anticipated that there will be any 
serious physical or psychological adverse events  associated with this study.  However, federal regulations 
require prompt reporting to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board (IRB), all injuries, adverse events, or other unanticipated problems involving risks to patients or others that occur in the course of a patient’s partic ipation in this research study. 
 
Routine Safety Reports  
All adverse events and study- related safety events will be collected by [CONTACT_6283]. Golightly and Smith -Ryan and co -
investigators (Allen, Nelson, Viera) and will be reported to the Thurston Arthritis Research Center 
Methodology Core, which works directly with the Regulatory Core of the NC TraCS Institute for monitoring 
Page  | 24 
 
adverse events of research. The PI’s will review aggregated unanticipated problems and adverse events on a 
monthly basis, or more often if urgent matters arise. This summary will be reported to the IRB as necessary.  
 
Expedited Reports - Serious Adverse Events  
We do not expect any serious adverse events to occur based on our previous experience with HIIT and knee OA patients. However, in the event that two adverse events are classified as either moderate or severe, the study will be placed on hold in order to reassess the study procedures in order to decrease the risk of another adverse event.  
 All interventional studies, independent of phase or type, must report Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). All SAEs, unless otherwise specified in the protocol and approved by [CONTACT_92774] ( NICHD ), require expedited reporting by [CONTACT_079] s (Drs. Golightly 
and Smith -Ryan). If a potential S AE is reported to any study personnel, the study personnel should make [CONTACT_91754] -Ryan  aware of the potential SAE at once.  [CONTACT_84135] -Ryan  will personally collect information from 
healthcare professionals involved in the study, the study participant and close relatives (if possible), and other study personnel.   Drs. Golightly and Smith -Ryan  will provide written documentation to 1) the Institutional Review Board at the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and 2) the Thurston Arthritis Research Center Methodology Core (serving as a data safety monitoring board), within 48 hours of learning about the SAE. A single form (Appendix F ) will be completed and sent to both the Safety Officer and the IRB by [CONTACT_92775], Drs. Golightly and Smith- Ryan . The action regarding the treatment of 
that specific patient taken by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Smith -Ryan  and/or lab members  will be indicated on the form, as well as 
actions that are taken for the study in general (No action, modification of HIIT, modification of consent documents to include a description of newly recognized risks, r evised protocol to eliminate appa rent immediate 
hazards to subjects, other). The Thurston Arthritis Research Center Methodology Core and IRB will be asked to notify Drs. Golightly and Smith -Ryan if they disagree with the specific actions taken within [ADDRESS_102597] be met: 1) 
unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency, 2) related or possibly related to participation in the research, and 3) 
a serious adverse event . The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), the Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS), provides a complete definition and the following guidance for reporting unanticipated problems to the Institutional Review Board(s) (IRBs): Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and Adverse Events . 
(http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
). OHRP recognizes that it may be difficult to determine 
whether a particular incident, experience, or outcome is unexpected and whether it is related or poss ibly related 
to participation in the research.  OHRP notes that an incident, experience, or outcome that meets the three criteria above generally will warrant consideration of substantive changes in the research protocol or informed consent process/document or other corrective actions in order to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of participants or others.   
 
Page  | [ADDRESS_102598] be reported to the IRB within 14 days and the Thurston Arthritis Research Center 
Methodology Core within 48 hours of the PI ’s receiving notification of the event. The same reporting process 
described under SAE reporting will be followed.   On occasion, there may be disagreements between the investigator and the DSMB regarding the assessment and/ or management of an event that qualifies as an unanticipated problem. The following excerpt gives 
guidance for cases where there is a difference of opi[INVESTIGATOR_92758] (referred to as the “monitoring entity” in the excerpt below) and the investigator http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
.   
 
Note: If the investigator determines that an adverse event is not an unanticipated problem, but the monitoring entity subsequently determines that the adverse event does in fact represent an unanticipated problem (for example, due to an unexpectedly higher frequency of the event), the monitoring entity should report this determination to the investigator, and such reports must be promptly submitted by [CONTACT_85213] (45 CFR 46.103(b)(5)).  
Please note: The independent safety officer and the Investigator may have iterative discussions regarding the assessment and may later come to agreement regarding the assessment and/or management of an AE. In cases where the independent safety officer and Investigator come to an agreement after discussions and the event is determined not to be an unanticipated problem, the Investigator is not required to report the event as an unanticipated problem to the IRB. Such discussions should take place promptly so as not to delay appropriate reporting to the IRB.  Examples of corrective actions or substantive changes that might need to be considered in response to an unanticipated problem include:  
 
 changes to the research protocol initiated by [CONTACT_92776];  
 modification of inclusion or exclusion criteria to mitigate the newly identified risks; 
 implementation of additiona l procedures for monitoring subjects; suspension of enrollment of new 
subjects;  
 suspension of research procedures in currently enrolled subjects;  
 modification of informed consent documents to include a description of newly recognized risks;  
 provision of additional information about newly recognized risks to previously enrolled subjects. 
Study Compliance  
 
Definitions  
Protocol deviation - any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures of a research protocol that is under the investigator’s control and that has not been approved by [CONTACT_1201].  Protocol violation - a deviation from the IRB-approved protocol that may affect the participant's rights, safety, 
or wellbeing and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data. 
 
Procedures  
Page  | [ADDRESS_102599]. Smith-Ryan, who is overseeing all 
lab testing and training.  As part of Aim 1 of this feasibil ity and proof-of-concept study, HIIT adherence and 
tolerability will be evaluated.  T he proposed protocol also allows f or individualization of HIIT (i.e. adjustment 
of mode and intensity of exercise).  Any adjustments in training will be recorded. Adherence and tolerability information from this study will be used to for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a larger scale trial that includes a home -based 
component to establish evidence for HIIT as a long- term therapeutic strategy for OA.  
 In order to minimize the risk of a protocol deviation or protocol violation [CONTACT_92794], a licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], w ill track compliance of the study procedures related to informed consent, follow up testing, 
IRB compliance, and compliance to treatment protocols.  
 
Follow-Up Testing – Each month [CONTACT_92788] will ensure that follow- up testing of each participant was 
performed in for each participant.   IRB Compliance -  [CONTACT_92788] will confirm each month that protocol information and consent forms used are 
approved by [CONTACT_92777].  
 
Biweekly meetings are scheduled with the study team to assist in a rapid implementation for any issues brought up, yet the PIs may take immediate action with the study team to ensure adherence of study protocols if an urgent issue is brought to attention.  The PIs will report protocol violations and deviations to the IRB at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill within 48 hours of the violation/deviation via the online IRBIS reporting system. Protocol deviations will addressed by [CONTACT_92778], informed consent 
form and manual of operating procedures if necessary.  All events will be reported at the time of the biannual at  
submission of the safety report. The study coordinator, Betsy Ha ckney , will maintain a log of all protocol 
deviations /violations  and will report them to [CONTACT_92788]  each month. These deviations / violations will be 
discussed with the Methodology Core at the Thurston Arthritis Research Center, who can provide monitoring 
and guidance regarding safety aspects of OA projects.  
 In the case of serious violations, a review of the personnel involved will be performed by [CONTACT_6283]. Golightly and Smith -Ryan .  Depending on the nature of the violation or deviation, study recrui tment and treatment may be 
stopped until the violation/deviation is addressed.  Actions may be taken to remove a participant from the data set if the deviation affects the data collected. It is possible that if a violation is deemed egregious study personnel may be dismissed from further involvement in the study in order to ensure future validity of the data collected and safety for study participants.  
 
Bi-annual Reporting   
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_92759] 3.k.1. All reports will be sent bi-annually to the Safety Officer, NCMRR  as soon as available. See section 3.k.[ADDRESS_102600] will be collected by  [CONTACT_92779]. Interview data will be collected by [CONTACT_92780],  and clinic 
visit data will be obtained by [CONTACT_92781].

Data Management. Data will be collected electronically using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap).  
This system is a secure web application for building and managing surveys and other data capture mechanisms 
for clinical research. The REDCap that will be used for the proposed project is hous ed at and  managed by 
[CONTACT_11604]’s North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute (NC TraCS; Clinical and  
Translational Science Award).  
 Upon enrollment in this study, each participant will be assigned an identification number. All written information collected will be associated with this identification number and stored in a locked file cabinet located in the Applied Physiology Laboratory in Fetzer Hall, UNC- CH. Only the PI s and research assistants will 
have access to this information. All electronic files will be password protected and stored on an encrypted external USB drive owned by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_92760] (TARC) server . Data 
management will be  completed using good clinical practices. Specifically, hard copy data sheets/case report 
forms will be used to capture initial data. This will then be transferred by a member of the research team to REDCap . Additional metrics will be used to identify potential mis -entries or outliers. Data will be further 
managed in statistical software, such as SPSS or SAS,  by [CONTACT_978] s. 
 
Data Access and Protection. All interview data and results of clinical examinations will be kept private to the  
extent allowed by [CONTACT_2371]. Records will be marked by [CONTACT_92782], not names. The electronic file that links a participant’s name [CONTACT_1639] a study identification number will be kept on a computer that is password protected. Drs. Golightly and Smith- Ryan and designated project staff  (study physicians, research assistants 
involved with recruitment, training, and testing) will be able to link study  identification numbers to names. For 
the proposed project, other members of the study team will not have access to these links or to participants’ names.  
 Confidentiality of data. Extreme care will be taken to ensure that there will be no breach of participant confidentiality. Each subject and their associated information will be identified by a [ADDRESS_102601]’s name [CONTACT_92786] (shredded by [CONTACT_92783] n completed). 
Email addresses and phone numbers will be obtained solely for the purpose of contact[CONTACT_92784]. All data will be stored in electronic format on both the data collection computer and the principle investigator's personal computer. Computer access will be protected via confidential passwords, and backup devices will be stored under lock- and-key in the APL. Only qualified members of the 
research team  will have access to these data. In the event of a confidentiality breach, responsible personnel will 
be severely reprim anded and potentially dismissed. 
Retention of Study Documents  
All study related files will be maintained for at least [ADDRESS_102602] access. Once 7 years’ time has passed, all study documents will be shredded.  
Administrative Forms  
Five administrative forms have been included in order to assist with the management of participant enrollment. Each administrative form is described below and is included. 
 
Page  | [ADDRESS_102603] will be used to document the participant ’s name, medical record number, 
randomization number, and study entry and study exit dates. The participant  identification code list will be kept 
within a filing cabinet located in the Princ ipal Investigators office, which is a secure location and separate from 
all other study files.  
Study Completion and Closeout Procedures  
Types of Study Close- out  
The two types of closeouts include a scheduled closeout, which occurs upon completion of the trial, and an unscheduled closeout which may occur as a result of failure to obtain continuation funding, negative or positive findings, findings in other studies that impact on the clinical tria l, or other unforeseen events. [CONTACT_92788] is 
responsible f or ensuring the following activities are completed prior to study close -out along with the 
Participant  Close-out Procedures described below. 
Participants Notification 
[CONTACT_92788] and [CONTACT_84135]-Ryan will need to approve any public disclosure of data or results. After all data 
for main outcome measures are calculated and published in peer -reviewed publications , participant s will be 
notified  about the main finding of the study with a summary publication shared electronically.  
Policies 
Privacy and Confidentia lity Procedures  
Confidentiality of participant data is always a priority, and measures to protect confidentiality are described below. There are no known social or legal risks associated with this project. The privacy and confidentiality of research partic ipant s are to be respected and protected at all times . Recruitment calls will be conducted from a 
private location within UNC study team staff space. Baseline and follow -up assessments will be conducted in 
private rooms where other personnel cannot hear interviews. Mailings will include only the address of the participant and return address that does not indicate health status, focus of the study or study name.   This research study will comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule as well as all other state, federal, and institutional regulations intended to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of human participant s involved in

Publication Policy  
Results will be shared by [CONTACT_92785], and both [CONTACT_92788] and [CONTACT_84135]- Ryan will 
need to approve any public disclosure of data or results. All members of the Research Team and the funding source will be acknowledged in public presentations. Authorship on publications will be determined based on the extent of scientific and intellectual input from each of the members of the team. In the event of conflicts regarding publication, outside and impart ial advisors will be requested to help with deliberations. Specifically, 
members of the Executive Committee and the Advisory Board of the Thurston Arthritis Research Center’s Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center can assist with conflict resolution. U NC has policies and formal 
procedures in place for dealing with scientific and intellectual property disputes. 
 
 
MOOP Maintenance  
[CONTACT_92788] and [CONTACT_84135] -Ryan  will maintain and update the Manual of Operations and Procedures (MOOP) 
throughout the study. To ensure accuracy and facilitate revisions and/or additions, pages of the MOOP will 
contain the version date. If any pi[INVESTIGATOR_44619] a MOOP is changed the date on the front cover of the MOOP will be adjusted for easy identification. If a new version of the MOOP is created it will be electronically mailed to all participant s on the study team.  Additionally, the MOOP will be maintained in a three -hole binder and availabl e 
to all study staff members for review. MOOP maintenance will be on the meeting agenda each month .
